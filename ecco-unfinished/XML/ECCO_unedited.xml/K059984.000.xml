<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has for some Ages been thought
so wonderful a thing to sail the
Tour or Circle or the Globe,
that when a Man has done this
mighty Feat, he presently thinks
it deserves to be recorded like
Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s. So as soon
as Men have acted the Sailor, they come a-shore and
write Books of their Voyage, not only to make a
great Noise of what they have done themselves,
but pretending to show the way to others to come
after them, they set up for Teachers and Chart
Makers to Posterity. Tho' most of them have had
this Misfortune, that whatever Success they have
had in the Voyage, they have had very little in
the Relation; except it be to tell us, that a Sea∣man
when he comes to the Press, is pretty much
out of his Element, and a very good Sailor may
make but a very indifferent Author.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
I do not in this, lessen the Merit of those Gen∣tlemen
who have made such a long Voyage, as that
round the Globe; but I must be allow'd to say, as
the way is now a common Road, the Reason of it
thoroughly known, and the Occasion of it more
frequent than in former Times; so the World
has done wondering at it; we no more look up∣on
it as a mighty thing, a strange and never heard
of Undertaking; this cannot be now expected of
us, the thing is made familiar, every ordinary
Sailor is able to do it, if his Merchants are but
qualified to furnish him for so long a Voyage; and
he that can carry a Ship to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> may with the
same Ease carry it round the World.</P>
<P>Some tell us, it is enough to wonder at a thing
nine Days, one would reasonably then conclude,
that it is enough that sailing round the World
has been wondered at above a Hundred Years: I
shall therefore let the Reader know, that it is
not the Rarity of going round the World that
has occasion'd this Publication, but if some Inci∣dents
have happened in such a Voyage, as either
have not happened to others, or as no other
People, tho' performing the same Voyage, have
taken notice of, then this Account may be worth
publishing, tho' the thing, <HI>viz.</HI> The Voyage
round the World, be in it self of no Value.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd, of the several Navigators
whose Voyages round the World have been pub∣lish'd,
that few, if any of them, have diverted us
with that Variety which a Circle of that Length
must needs offer. We have very little account of
their Landings, their Diversions, the Accidents
which happen'd to them, or to others by their
Means; the Stories of their Engagements, when
they have had any Scuffle either with Natives, or
<HI>European</HI> Enemies, are told superficially and by
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Halves; the Storms and Difficulties at Sea or on
Shore, have no where a full Relation; and all the
rest of their Accounts are generally fill'd up with
Directions for Sailors coming that way, the Bear∣ings
of the Land, the Depth of the Channels,
Entrances, and Barrs, at the several Ports, An∣chorage
in the Bays, and Creeks, and the like
Things, useful indeed for Seamen going thither
again, <HI>and how few are they?</HI> but not at all to the
Purpose when we come expecting to find the
History of the Voyage.</P>
<P>Another sort of these Writers have just gi∣ven
us their long Journals, tedious Accounts of
their Log-work, how many Leagues they sail'd
every Day; where they had the Winds, when it
blew hard, and when softly; what Latitude in
every Observation, what Meridian Distance, and
what Variation of the Compass. Such is the Ac∣count
of Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI>'s Voyage to the <HI>South
Seas,</HI> adorn'd with I know not how many Charts
of the famous Streight of <HI>Magellan,</HI> a place only
now famous for showing the Ignorance of
Sir <HI>John Narbrough,</HI> and a great many wise Gentle∣men
before him, and for being a Passage they had
no need to have troubled themselves with, and
which no Body will ever go through any more.</P>
<P>Such also are the Voyages of Captain <HI>John Wood,</HI>
to <HI>Nova Zemla,</HI> an the Charge of the Publick, in
King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId's time, and <HI>Martin Forbisher</HI>
to the North West Passages, in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s
time; all which, are indeed full of their own
Journals, and the Incidents of sailing, but have
little or nothing of Story in them, for the use of
such Readers who never intend to go to Sea, and
yet such Readers may desire to hear how it has
far'd with those that have, and how Affairs stand
in those remote Parts of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
For these Reasons, when first I set out upon a
cruising and trading Voyage to the <HI>East,</HI> and re∣solv'd
to go any where, and every where that
the Advantage of Trade or the Hopes of Pur∣chase
should guide us, I also resolv'd to take such
exact notice of every thing that past within my
Reach, that I would be able, if I liv'd to come
home, to give an Account of my Voyage, differ∣ing
from all that I had ever seen before, in the
nature of the Observations, as well as the man∣ner
of relating them: And as this is perfectly
new in its Form, so I cannot doubt but it will be
agreeabie in the Particulars, seeing either no Voy∣age
ever made before, had such Variety of Inci∣dents
happening in it, so useful and so diverting, or
no Person that sail'd on those Voyages, has
thought fit to publish them after this manner.</P>
<P>Having been fitted out in the River of <HI>Thames</HI>
so lately as the Year 1713. and on a Design per∣haps
not very consistent with the Measures ta∣king
at that time for the putting an End to the
War, I must be allowed to own I was at first
oblig'd to act not in my own Name, but to put
in a <HI>French</HI> Commander into the Ship, for the
Reasons which follow, and which those who un∣derstand
the manner of Trade upon closing the
late War, I mean the Trade with <HI>Spain,</HI> will ea∣sily
allow to be just and well grounded.</P>
<P>During the late War between <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and her Confederates on one side, and the united
Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> on the other side, we
all know the <HI>French</HI> had a free Trade into the
<HI>South Seas;</HI> a Trade carried on with the greatest
Advantage, and to the greatest Degree, that any
Particular Commerce has been carried on in the
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
World for many Ages past; insomuch that we
found the Return of Silver that came back to
<HI>France</HI> by those Ships, was not only the enrich∣ing
of the Merchants of St. <HI>Malo, Rochell,</HI> and
other Ports in <HI>France,</HI> some of whom we saw get
immense Estates in a few Years, even to a Mil∣lion
<HI>Sterling</HI> a Man. But it was evident, the
King of <HI>France</HI> himself was enabled by the Circu∣lation
of so much Bullion thro' his Mints, to carry
on that War with very great Advantage.</P>
<P>It was just at the Close of this War, when
some Merchants of <HI>London</HI> looking with Envy on
the Success of that Trade, and how the <HI>French,</HI>
notwithstanding the Peace, would apparently
carry it on, for some Years at least, to infinite
Advantage, began to consider whether it might
not be possible to come in for a Snack with <HI>France,</HI>
as they were ally'd to <HI>Spain,</HI> and yet go abroad
in the Nature of a private Cruiser.</P>
<P>To bring this to pass, it was thought proper
in the first place, to get a Share, if possibe, in
a new Design of an <HI>East India</HI> Trade in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
just then intended to be set up by
some <HI>British</HI> Merchants, by the Assistance of an
Imperial Charter, or at least under Colour of it;
and so we might go to Sea in a threefold Capacity,
to be made use of as Occasion might present; <HI>viz.</HI>
when on the Coast of <HI>New Spain</HI> we sought to
trade, we were <HI>French</HI> Men, had a <HI>French</HI> Captain,
and a sufficient Number of <HI>French</HI> Seamen, and
<HI>Flemish</HI> or <HI>Walloon</HI> Seamen, who spoke <HI>French,</HI> so to
appear on all proper Occasions. When at Sea
we met with any <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship worth our while,
we were <HI>English</HI> Cruisers, had Letters of Mart
from <HI>England,</HI> had no Account of the Peace, and
were fitted for the Attack. And when in the
<HI>East Indies</HI> we had occasion to trade, either at the
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<HI>English</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlements, we should have Im∣perial
Colours, and two <HI>Flemish</HI> Merchants at
least in Appearance, to transact every thing as we
found Occasion. However, this last part of our
Project fail'd us, that Affair not being fully ripe.</P>
<P>As this mysterious Equipment may be liable
to some Exceptions, and perhaps to some En∣quiries,
I shall for the present conceal my Name,
and that of the Ship also: By Enquiries, I mean
Enquiries of private Persons concern'd; for as to
publick Enquiries, we have no Uneasiness, ha∣ving
acted nothing in Contradiction to the Rules
and Laws of our Country; but I say, as to pri∣vate
Persons, it is thought fit to prevent their
Enquiries, to which end, the Captain in whose
Name I write this, gives me leave to make use
of his Name, and conceal my own.</P>
<P>The Ship sail'd from the River the 20th of <HI>De∣cember</HI>
1713. and went directly over to the Coast
of <HI>Flanders,</HI> lying at an Anchor in <HI>Newport Pitts,</HI>
as they are call'd, where we took in our <HI>French</HI>
Captain <HI>Jean Michael Mirlotte,</HI> who with 32 <HI>French</HI>
Seamen, came on board us in a large Snow from
<HI>Dunkirk,</HI> bringing with them 122 small Anchors
or Rundlets or Brandy, and some Hampers and
Casks of <HI>French</HI> Wine in Wicker'd Bottles: While
we were here, we lay under <HI>English</HI> Colours, with
Pendants flying, our Ship being upwards of 500
Tun, and had 46 Guns mounted, mann'd with
356 Men: We took the more Men on board
because we resolv'd as Occasion should present, to
fit our selves with another Ship, which we did
not question we should meet with in the <HI>South Seas.</HI></P>
<P>We had also a third Design in our Voyage,
tho' it may be esteem'd an Accident to the
rest, <HI>viz.</HI> We were resolv'd to make some At∣tempts
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
for new Discoveries, as Opportunity offer∣ed;
and we had two Persons on board who were
exceedingly well qualified for our Direction in
this part, all which was deriv'd from the follow∣ing
Occasion;</P>
<P>The Person who was principally concern'd in
the Adventure, was a Man not only of great
Wealth, but of great Worth; he was par∣ticularly
addicted to what we call New Disco∣veries,
and it was indeed upon his Genius to such
Things, that the first Thought of the Voyage
was founded: This Gentleman told us, that he
had already sent one Ship fully equipt and fur∣nish'd
for a new Attempt, upon the <HI>North West</HI>
or <HI>North East</HI> Passages, which had been so often
in vain tried by former Navigators; and that he
did not question the Success, because he had di∣rected
them by new Measures, and to steer a
Course that was never attempted yet; and his
Design in our Voyage was to make like Disco∣veries
towards the <HI>South</HI> Pole; where, as he said,
and gave us very good Reasons for it, he did not
doubt but we might discover even to the Pole it
self, and find out New Worlds and new Seas,
which had never been heard of before.</P>
<P>With these Designs, this Gentleman came in∣to
the other part of our Project and contributed
the more largely, and with the more Freedom,
to the whole, upon that Account; in parti∣cular,
all the needful Preparations for such Disco∣veries,
were made wholly at his Expence, which
I take Notice of here, as being most proper in
the Beginning of our Story, and that the Reader
may the less wonder at the odd way we took to
perform a Voyage which might with much more
Ease have been done by the usual and ordinary
way.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
We sail'd from the Coast of <HI>Flanders</HI> the second
of <HI>January,</HI> and without any extraordinary Inci∣dent
made the Coast of <HI>Galloway</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> the
tenth, where we stay'd and took in a very ex∣traordinary
Store of Provisions, three times as
much as usual; the Beef being also well pickled or
double pack'd, that we might have a sufficient
Reserve for the Length of our Voyage, resolving
also to spare it as much as possible.</P>
<P>We had a very rich Cargo on board, consisting
of all sorts of <HI>British</HI> Manufactures suitable for the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Trade in their <HI>West Indies;</HI> and as we
aim'd at nothing of Trade till we came to the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Coast, we sail'd directly for the <HI>Canary</HI>
Islands; having not fully resolv'd whether we
would make our Voyage to the <HI>South Seas</HI> first,
and so round the Globe by the <HI>East Indies,</HI> as has
been the ordinary way, or whether we would go
first by the <HI>East Indies,</HI> and upon the Discoveries
we were directed to, and then cross the great
<HI>Pacifick</HI> Ocean to the <HI>West</HI> Coast of <HI>America,</HI> as
was at last resolv'd.</P>
<P>We made the <HI>Canaries</HI> the eleventh of <HI>February,</HI>
and coming to an Anchor there to take in some
fresh Water, we put out <HI>French</HI> Colours, and sent
our Boat on Shore, with a <HI>French</HI> Boatswain and
all <HI>French</HI> Seamen, to buy what we wanted: They
brought us on board five Butts or Pipes of Wine,
and some Provisions, and having fill'd our Water,
we set Sail again the thirteenth: In this time we
call'd a Council among our selves, by which way
we should go as above.</P>
<P>I confess, I was for going by the Cape of <HI>Good
Hope</HI> first, and so to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> then keeping
to the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Java,</HI> go away to the <HI>Moluccoes,</HI>
where I made no doubt to make some Purchase among
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Spice Islands, and so go away
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
to the <HI>Philippines;</HI> but the whole Ships Company,
I mean of Officers, were against me in this Scheme,
altho' I told them plainly that the Discoveries
which would he made in such a Voyage as that,
were the principal Reasons why our chief Owner
embark'd In the Adventure, and that we ought
to regard the End and Design of our Voy∣age;
that it would certainly in the Close of things
amount to the same, as to Trade, as if we went
the usual way, seeing the Places we were to go
to, were the same one way as the other, and it
was only putting the Question which we should
go to first; that all the Navigators on such Voy∣ages
as these, went by the <HI>South Seas</HI> first, which
would be no Honour to us at all; but if we went
by the <HI>East Indies</HI> first, we should be the first that
ever went such a Voyage, and that we might
make many useful Discoveries and Experiments
in trying that Course; that it would be worth
our while, not only to go that way, but to have
all the World take notice of it, and of us for it.</P>
<P>I used a great many Arguments of the like Na∣ture,
but they answer'd me most effectually, with
laying before me the Difficulties of the Voyage,
and the contrary Methods of Trade, which, in a
Word, made the going that way impracticable:
First, the Difficulty of the Voyage, over the vast
Ocean call'd the <HI>Pacifick Sea,</HI> or <HI>South Sea,</HI> which,
if we kept a <HI>Southern</HI> Latitude, and took the vari∣able
Winds as we should find them, as I pro∣pos'd
to do, might very well be a Voyage of six
or eight Months, without any sight of Land, or
supply of Provisions or Water, which was into∣lerable;
that as to Trade, it was preposterous,
and just setting the Voyage with the Bottom up∣ward;
for as we were loaden with Goods, and
had no Money, our first Business was to go to the
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<HI>South Seas,</HI> where our Goods were wanted, and
would sell for Money, and then to the <HI>East Indies,</HI>
where our Money would be wanting, to buy
other Goods to carry home, and not to go to the
<HI>East Indies</HI> first, where our Goods would not sell,
and where we could buy no other for want of
Money.</P>
<P>This was so strong a way of reasoning, that
they were all against me, as well <HI>French</HI> as <HI>English,</HI>
and even the two Agents for Discoveries, sub∣mitted
to it; and so we resolv'd to stand away
from the <HI>Canaries,</HI> to the Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> thence
upon the <HI>Eastern</HI> Coast of <HI>South America</HI> to Cape
<HI>Horn,</HI> and then into the <HI>South Seas;</HI> and if we
met with any thing that was <HI>Spanish</HI> by the way,
we resolv'd to make Prize of it, as in a time of
War.</P>
<P>Accordingly we made the Coast of <HI>Brasil</HI> in
about twenty six Days, from the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands,
and went on Shore at Cape St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> for
fresh Water, afterwards we put into the Bay of
<HI>All Saints,</HI> got some fresh Provisions there, and
about an Hundred very good Hogs, some of
which we kill'd and pickled up their Flesh, and
carried the rest on board alive, having taken on
board a great Quantity of Roots, and <HI>Maiz,</HI> or
<HI>Indian</HI> Corn, for their Food which they thriv'd
on very well.</P>
<P>It was the last of <HI>March</HI> when we came to the
Bay, and having stay'd there fourteen Days, to
furnish our selves with all Things we wanted, we
got Intelligence there, that there were three
Ships at the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> in the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI>
which were preparing to go for <HI>Europe,</HI> and that
they expected two <HI>Spanish</HI> Men of War to be their
Convoy, because of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Men of War
which were in <HI>Brasil,</HI> to Convoy the <HI>Brasil</HI> Fleet.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
Their having two <HI>Spanish</HI> Men of War with
them for their Convoy, took away a great deal
from the Joy we had entertain'd at the News of
their being there, and we began to think we
should make little or nothing of it: However,
we resolv'd to see the utmost of it, and particu∣larly
if our double Appearance would not now
stand us in some stead.</P>
<P>Accordingly we went away for the River of
<HI>plate,</HI> and as usual, spreading <HI>French</HI> Colours, we
went boldly up to <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and sent in our
Boat, mann'd with <HI>French</HI> Men, pretending to
be homeward bound from the <HI>South Seas</HI> and in
want of Provisions. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> receiv'd us with
Civility enough, and granted us such Provisions
as we wanted; and here we found, to our great
Satisfaction, that there was no such thing as any
<HI>Spanish</HI> Man of War there; but they said they ex∣pected
one, and the Governor there for the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> asked our <HI>French</HI> Officer if we would take
one of their Ships under our Convoy; Monsieur
<HI>Mirlotte</HI> answer'd him warily, that his Ship was
deep loaden, and foul, and he could not un∣dertake
any thing, but if they would keep him
Company, he would do them what Service
he could; but that also, as they were a rich
Ship, they did not design to go directly to <HI>France</HI>
but to <HI>Martinico,</HI> where they expected to meet
with some <HI>French</HI> Men of War to Convoy them
home. This Answer was so well manag'd, tho'
there was not one Word of Truth in it, that one
of the three Ships, for the other two were not
ready, resolv'd to come away with us, and, in
an evil Hour for them, they did so.</P>
<P>To be short, we took the innocent <HI>Spaniard</HI> into
our Convoy, and sail'd away to the <HI>Northward</HI>
with them, but were not far at Sea, before we
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
let them know what Circumstances they were in,
by the following Method: We were about half
a League a Head of them, when our Captain
bringing too, and haling tip our Courses, made a
Signal to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for the Captain to come on
board, which he very readily did; as soon as he
was on board, our Captain let him know that
he was our Prisoner, and all his Men, and imme∣diately
manning their Boat with thirty of our
own Men, we sent them on board their Ship, to
take Possession of her, but order'd them that they
should be have civilly to the Men on board, and
plunder nothing: For we made a Promise to
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain, that his Ship should not be
plunder'd, upon Condition he would give us a
just Account of his loading, and deliver peace∣ably
to us what Riches he had on board;
then we also agreed, that we would restore him
his Ship, which by the way we found was chiefly
loaden with Hides, Things of no Value to us,
and that the Ship also, was an old Vessel, strong,
but often doubled, and therefore a very heavy
sailer, and consequently not at all fit for our
purpose, tho' we greatly wanted a Ship to take
along with us, we having both too many Men,
and being too full of Goods, as I have said above.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain, tho' surpriz'd with the
Stratagem that had brought him thus into the
Hands of his Enemies, and greatly enrag'd in
his Mind at being circumvented, and trapann'd
out of his Ship, yet shew'd a great Pre∣sence
of Mind under his Misfortune; and, as I
verily believe, he would have fought us very
bravely, if we had let him know fairly what we
were, so he did not at all appear dejected at his
Disaster, but capitulated with us as if he bad
been talking Sword in Hand. And one time
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
when our Captain and he could not agree,
and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain was a little threatned, he
grew warm; told the Captain that he might be
ill us'd, being in his Hands, but that he was not
afraid to suffer whatever his ill Fortune had pre∣par'd
for him, and he would not, for fear of ill
Usage, yield to base Conditions; that he was a
Man of Honour, and if he (our Captain) was so
too, he demanded to be put on board his own
Ship again, and he should see he knew how to
behave himself. Our Captain smil'd at that, and
told him, he was not afraid to put him on board
his own Ship and fight for her again, and that
if be did so, he was sure he could not escape him;
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain smil'd too, and told him he
should see (if he did) that he knew the way to
Heaven from the Bottom of the Sea, as well as
any other Road, and that Men of Courage were
never at a loss to conquer their Enemy one way
or other; intimating, that he would sink by his
Side rather than be taken, and that he would
take care to be but a very indifferent Prize to
him, if he was conquered.</P>
<P>However, we came to better Terms with him
afterward and in short, having taken on board
all the Silver, which was about 200000 Pieces of
Eight, and whatever else we met with that was
valuable, among the rest, his Ammunition, and
six Brass Guns. We performed Conditions, and
sent him into the <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI> again with his
Ship, to let the other <HI>Spanish</HI> Captains know
what scouring they had escaped.</P>
<P>We got a good Booty here indeed, but were
disappointed of a Ship; however, we were not
so sensible of that Disappointment now, as we
were afterwards: For as we depended upon go∣ing
to the <HI>South Seas,</HI> we made no doubt of meet∣ing
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
with Vessels enough for our purpose; what
followed, we shall soon see.</P>
<P>We had done our Work here, and had neither
any Occasion or any Desire to lie any longer on
this Coast, where the Climate was bad, and the
Weather exceeding hot, and where our Men be∣gan
to be very uneasy, being crowded together
so close all in one Ship; so we made the best of
our way <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>We met with some stormy Weather in these
Seas, and particularly a <HI>North West</HI> Blast, which
carried us for eleven Days, or thereabouts, a
great way off to Sea: But as we had Sea Room
enough, and a stout strong built Ship under us,
perfectly well prepar'd, tite and firm, we made
light of the Storms we met with, and soon came
into our Voyages way again; so that about the
fourth of <HI>May</HI> we made Land in the Latitude of
45 Degrees 12 Minutes <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>We put in here for fresh Water, and finding
nothing of the Land mark'd in our Charts, we
had no knowledge of the place, but coming to
an Anchor at about a League from the Shore, our
Boat went in quest of a good watering place; in
pursuit of this, they went up a Creek about two
Leagues more, where they found good Water,
and fill'd some Casks, and so came on Board to
make their Report.</P>
<P>The next Day we came into the Creeks Mouth
where we found six to eight Fathom Water
within Cables Length of the Shore, and found
fresh Water enough, but no People or Cattle,
tho' an excellent Country for both.</P>
<P>Of this Country, I made many Observations,
suitable to the Design and Desire of our ingeni∣ous
Imployer and Owner, and which are one
end of publishing this Voyage: I shall mention
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
only one here, because shall come to speak it
again on another Occasion more largely. My
Observation here, is as follows:
<Q>An Observation concerning the Soil and
Climate of the Continent of America,
South of the River <HI>De la Plata;</HI> and
how suitable to the Genius, the Consti∣tution,
and the Manner of living En∣glishmen,
and consequently for am En∣glish
Colony.</Q></P>
<P>THE particular Spot which I observe upon,
is that part of the Continent of <HI>America</HI>
which lies on the Shore of the <HI>North Seas,</HI> as they
are call'd, tho' falsly; for they are more proper∣ly
the <HI>East Seas,</HI> being extended along the <HI>East</HI>
Shores of <HI>South America.</HI> The Land lies on the
same <HI>East</HI> side of <HI>America,</HI> extended <HI>North</HI> and
<HI>South</HI> from <HI>Coasta Deserta,</HI> in 42 Degrees, to Port
St. <HI>Julian,</HI> in 49 Degrees and a half, being al∣most
500 Miles in Length, full of very good Har∣bours,
and some navigable Rivers; the Land
is a Plain for several Scores of Miles within
the Shore; with several little rising Hills, but no
where mountainous or stony; well adapted for
enclosing, feeding, and grazing of Cattle; also for
Corn, all sorts of which would certainly not only
grow, but thrive very well here; especially
Wheat, Rye, Pease, and Barley, Things which
would soon be improv'd by <HI>Englishmen,</HI> to the
making the Country rich and populous, the rai∣sing
great Quantities of Grain of all Sorts, and
Cattle in Proportion. The Trade which I pro∣pose
for the Consumtion or all the Produce, and
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
the place whither to be carried, I refer to speak
of by it self, in the further Pursuit of this Work.</P>
<P>I return now to the Pursuit of our Voyage. We
put to Sea again the tenth of <HI>May,</HI> with fair Wea∣ther
and a fair Wind; tho' a Season of the Year,
'tis true, when we might have Reason to expect
some Storms, being what we might call the Depth
of their Winter. However, the Winds held
<HI>Northerly,</HI> which there are to be esteem'd the
warm Winds, and bringing mild Weather; and
so they did till we came into the Latitude of 50
Degrees, when we had strong Winds and squaly
Weather, with much Snow and Cold, from the
<HI>S. W.</HI> and <HI>S. W.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> which blowing very hard,
we put back to Port St. <HI>Julian,</HI> where we were
not able to stir for some time.</P>
<P>We weigh'd again the 29th and strood <HI>South</HI>
again past the Mouth of the Streights of
<HI>Magellan,</HI> a Streight famous for many Years, for
being thought to be the only Passage out of the
<HI>North Seas</HI> into the <HI>South Seas,</HI> and therefore I
say famous some Ages; not only in the Disco∣very
of it by <HI>Magellan,</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain, but of
such Significance, that for many Years it was
counted a great Exploit to pass this Streight,
and few have ever done it of our Nation but that
they have thought fit to tell the World of it, as
an extraordinary Business, fit to be made publick
as an Honour to their Names. Nay King <HI>Charles</HI>
the IId thought it worth while to send Sir <HI>John
Narbrough</HI> on purpose to pass and take an exact
Survey of this Streight, and the Map or Plan of
it has been publish'd by Sir <HI>John</HI> himself, at the
publick Expence, as a useful thing.</P>
<P>Such a mighty and valuable thing also was
the passing this Straight, that Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s
going thro' it, gave birth to that famous old
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Wives Saying, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Sir</HI> Francis Drake <HI>shot
the Gulph;</HI> a Saying that was current in <HI>England</HI>
for many Years, I believe near a Hundred after
Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> was gone his long Journey <HI>of all;</HI>
as if there had been but one Gulph in the World,
and that passing it had been a Wonder next to
that of <HI>Hercules</HI> cleansing the <HI>Egean</HI> Stable.</P>
<P>Of this famous place I could not but observe
on this Occasion, that as Ignorance gave it its
first Fame, and made it for so many Ages the
most eminent part of the Globe, as it was the
only Passage by which the whole World could be
surrounded, and that it was every Man's Honour
that had pass'd it, as above; so now it is come
to the full End or Period of its Fame, and will
in all Probability never have the Honour to
have any Ship, Vessel, or Boat, go through it
more, while the World remains, unless (which
is very improbable) that part of the World
should come to be fully inhabited. I know some
are of Opinion, that before the full Period of the
Earth's Existence, all the remotest and most bar∣ren
Parts of it shall be peopled; but I see no
Ground for such a Notion, but many Reasons
which would make it appear to be impracticable,
and indeed impossible; unless it should please God
to alter the Sitnation of the Globe as it respects
the Sun, and place it in a direct, as it now moves
in an oblique Position; or that a new Species of
Mankind should be produced, who might be as
well qualified to live in the Frozen Zone, as we
are in the Temperate, and upon whom the Ex∣tremity
of Cold could have no Power. I say, as
there are several Parts of the Globe where this
would be impracticable, I shall say no more than
this, that I think 'tis a groundless Suggestion.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
But to return to our Voyage; we pass'd by
the Mouth of this famous Streight <HI>De Magellan,</HI>
and those others which were pass'd thro' by
<HI>Le Maire</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man afterwards; and keep∣ing
an offing of six or seven Leagues, went away
South, till we came into the Latitude of 58. when
we would, as we had tried three Days before,
have stretched away <HI>South West,</HI> to have got into
the <HI>South Seas,</HI> but a strong Gale of Wind took us
at <HI>W. N. W.</HI> and tho' we could (lying; near to it)
stretch away to the <HI>Southward,</HI> yet as it over∣blow'd,
we could make no <HI>Westward</HI> way; and
tho' we had under us an excellent strong built
Vessel, that valued not the Waves, and made ve∣ry
good work of it, yet we went away to Lee∣ward
in spight of all we could do, and lost
Ground amain. We held it out however, the
Weather being clear, but excessive cold, till we
found our selves in the Latitude of 64.</P>
<P>We call'd our Council several times, to con∣sider
what we should do, for we did but drive to
Leeward; the longer we strove with it, the
Gale held still, and to our Apprehensions it was
set in; blowing like a kind of <HI>Monson,</HI> or <HI>Trade
Wind,</HI> tho' in those Latitudes I know there is no
such thing properly call'd, as a <HI>Trade Wind.</HI></P>
<P>We tried (the Wind abating) to beat up again
to the <HI>North,</HI> and we did so; but it was by run∣ning
a great way to the <HI>East;</HI> and once I believe
we were in the Longitude of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> tho' so
far <HI>South,</HI> but it cost us infinite Labour, and near
six Weeks time, at length we made the Coast, and
arrived again at the Port of St. <HI>Julian</HI> the 20th of
<HI>June,</HI> which, by the way, is the Depth of their
Winter.</P>
<P>Here we resolv'd to lay up for the Winter,
and not attempt to go so far <HI>South</HI> again at that
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
time of Year, but our eager Desire of pursuing
our Voyage prevail'd, and we put out to Sea
again, having taken in fresh Provisions, such as
are to be had there; that is to say, Seals, Pen∣guines,
and such like Trade, and with this Re∣cruit
we put to Sea, I say, a second time.</P>
<P>We had this time worse Luck than we had
before, for the Wind setting in at <HI>South West,</HI>
blew a Storm, and drove us with such Force
away to Sea <HI>Eastward,</HI> that we were never able to
make any way to the <HI>Southward</HI> at all, but were
Carried away with a continued Storm of Wind,
from the same Corner, or near it, our Pilot, or
Master, as we call'd him, finding himself often
obliged to go away before it, and it kept us
out so long at Sea, and we were gone so far to
the <HI>North East, Eastward,</HI> that he advised us to
stand away for the Cape of <HI>Good Hope;</HI> and ac∣cordingly
we did so, and arriv'd at the Cape the
last Day of <HI>July.</HI> We were now dead hearted
indeed, and I began to revive my Proposal of
going to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> as I had at first intended;
and to answer the Objection which they made
against it, as being against the Nature of Trade,
and that we had nothing on board but <HI>European</HI>
Goods, which were not fitted for the <HI>East Indies,</HI>
where Money only was suitable to the Market
we were to make. I say to answer this Obje∣ction,
I told them I would engage that I would
sell our whole Cargo at the <HI>Phillipine</HI> Islands, as
well as on the Coast of <HI>America;</HI> for that those
Islands being <HI>Spanish,</HI> our Disguise of being <HI>French</HI>
would serve us as well at the <HI>Phillipines,</HI> as it
would in <HI>New Spain;</HI> and with this particular
Advantage, that we should sell here for four
times the Value as we should on the Coast of
<HI>Chili,</HI> or <HI>Peru;</HI> and that when we bad done; we
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
could load our Ship again there, or in other Pla∣ces
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> with such Goods as would come
to a good Market again in <HI>New Spain.</HI></P>
<P>This I told them was indeed what had not
been practis'd, nor at any other time would it
be practicable: For as it was not usual for any
Ships to go from the <HI>East Indies</HI> to the <HI>Philippines,</HI>
so neither was it usual for any <HI>European</HI> Ships to
trade with Freedom to the <HI>South Seas,</HI> till since
the late War, when the <HI>French</HI> had the Priviledge:
and I could not but be amaz'd that the <HI>French</HI> had
never gone this way, where they might have made
three or four Voyages in one, and with much
less Hazard of meeting with the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI>
Cruisers; and have made twice the Profits which
they made the other way, where they were fre∣quently
out three or four Years upon one Re∣turn;
whereas here they might make no less than
three Returns, or perhaps four, in the same Voy∣age,
and in much less time.</P>
<P>They were now a little surprized, for in all
our first Debates we had nothing of this Matter
brought in Question; only they entertain'd a No∣tion
that I was going upon strange Projects, to
make Discoveries, search for the <HI>South</HI> Pole,
plant new Colonies, and I know not how many
Whims of their own, which were neither in my
Design, or in my Instructions. The Person there∣fore
who was our <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> and the other Cap∣tain
whose Name I have not mentioned, together
with the <HI>French</HI> Captain <HI>Mirlotte,</HI> and the rest who
had all oppos'd me before, came chearfully into
my Proposal, only the <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> told me in the
Name of the rest, that he began to be more sen∣sible
of the Advantages of the Voyage I had pro∣pos'd,
than he was before; but that us he was
entrusted, together with me, in the Govern∣ment
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
of the trading part, for I was empower'd
equally with him too, he begg'd I would not take
it ill, that he desir'd I would let him farther into
that Particular, and explain my self at least as
far as I thought fit.</P>
<P>This was so just a Request, and so easy for me
to do, and above all, was made with so much
good Manners and Courtesy, that I told him, if I
had been otherwise determin'd, the courteous
and good humour'd way, with which he requir'd
it, would constrain me to it; but that however
I was very ready to do it, as he was entrusted
with the Cargo equally with me, and that it was
a piece of Justice to the Owners, that who they
thought fit to trust, I should trust also; upon
this I told him. My Scheme was as follows:</P>
<P>First, I told him, that as the <HI>Phillipine</HI> Islands
receiv'd all their <HI>European</HI> Goods from <HI>Acapulco</HI> in
<HI>America</HI> by the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Ships, they were
oblig'd to give what Price was imposed upon
them by the Merchants, who brought those
Goods by so many Stages to <HI>Acapulco.</HI> For Ex∣ample;
the <HI>European</HI> Goods, or suppose <HI>English</HI>
Goods in particular, with which they were load∣en,
went first from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> from <HI>Ca∣diz</HI>
by the Galloons to <HI>Porto Belo,</HI> from <HI>Porto Belo</HI>
to <HI>Panama,</HI> from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Acapulco;</HI> in all
which Places, the Merchants had their several
Commisions and other Profits upon the Sale; be∣sides
the extravagant Charges of so many several
ways of Carriage, some by Water, some by Land,
and besides the King's Customs in all those Pla∣ces;
and that after all this, they were brought
by Sea from <HI>Acapulco</HI> to the <HI>Phillipine</HI> Islands,
which was a prodigious Voyage, and were then
generally sold in the <HI>Phillippine</HI> Islands at three
Hundred <HI>per Cent.</HI> advance.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24"/>
That in the Room of all this, our Cargo being
well bought and well sorted, would come to the
<HI>Phillippine</HI> Islands at once, without any landing or
relanding, and without any of all the Additions
of Charge to the first Cost, as those by the way
of <HI>New Spain</HI> had upon them; so that if we were
to sell them at the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands a Hundred
<HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper than the <HI>Spaniards</HI> usually sold,
yet we should get abundantly more than we could
on the Coast of <HI>Peru,</HI> tho' we had been allow'd a
free Trade there.</P>
<P>That there was but two Objections to this Ad∣vantage,
and these were, our Liberty of trading,
and whether the place would consume the Quan∣tity
of Goods we had: And to this I had much to
answer; First, That it was well known at the
<HI>Phillippine</HI> Isles, that the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
were united firmly together▪ that the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> had allowed the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Subjects
a free Trade in his <HI>American</HI> Dominions, and con∣sequently
that it would not be denied there; but
on the other hand, that if it was deny'd by the
Governor, yet there would be room to find out a
Trade with the Inhabitants, and especially with
the <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Japan</HI> Merchants, who were al∣ways
there, which Trade, the Governor could
not prevent; and thus we could not fear a Mar∣ket
for all our Cargo, if it was much greater than
it was.</P>
<P>That as to the Returns, we had the Advan∣tage
either way: For First, We should be sure
to receive a great part of the Price of our Goods
in <HI>Chinese</HI> or <HI>Japan</HI> Gold and Silver, or in Pieces
of Eight; or it we thought fit to trade another
way, we might take on board such a Quantity
of <HI>China</HI> Damasks, and other wrought Silks,
Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lins, and Chints, <HI>China</HI> Ware, and <HI>Japan</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
Ware; all which, would be immediately sold in
<HI>America;</HI> that we should carry a Cargo of these
Goods to <HI>New Spain,</HI> infinitely to our Advantage,
being the same Cargo which the four great <HI>Aca∣pulco</HI>
Ships carry back with them every Year:
That when we had gone to the <HI>South Seas</HI> with
this Cargo, of which we knew we should make a
good Market, we had nothing to do but to come
back, if we thought fit, to the <HI>East Indies</HI> again,
where we might load for <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI>
such Goods as we thought proper; or if we did
not think fit to take so great a Run, we might
go away to the <HI>South,</HI> and round by Cape <HI>Horn</HI>
into the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and perfect those Disco∣veries,
which we made part of, in the beginning
of our Voyage.</P>
<P>This was so clear a Scheme of Trade, that he
seem'd surpriz'd with it, and fully satisfied in
every part of it. But the Captain then objected
against the Length of the Voyage to the <HI>South Seas</HI>
from the <HI>Philippines</HI> and rais'd several Scruples
about the Latitude which we should keep in such
a Voyage; that we should not be able to carry
any Provisions which we could take on board in
those hot Countries, that would keep for so long
a Run, and several other Difficulties; to all
which, I made answer, that when we had sold
our Cargo at the <HI>Phillipines,</HI> and found our Ad∣vantages
there to answer our Desires, I would
not oppose our returning from thence directly to
<HI>England,</HI> if they found it needful; or if they
thought a farther Adventure would not answer
the Risques we were to expect in it; and that we
would never have any Dispute about that.</P>
<P>This satisfied them fully, and they went im∣mediately
with the News to the Men, as what
they thought would please them wonderfully,
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
seeing they were mighty uneasy but two or three
Days before, about their being to go back again
to the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> and the Latitude of 64.
where we had not only been twice driven back,
as if Heaven had forbidden us to pass that way,
but had been driven so far to the <HI>South,</HI> that we
had met with a most severe Cold, and which pin∣ched
our Men exceedingly, who being come, as
we might say, a hot Weather Voyage, were but
ill furnish'd for the Weather usual in the Lati∣tudes
of 64.</P>
<P>But we had a harder Task to go through than
we expected, upon this Occasion; and it may
stand here upon Record, as a Buoy or Beacon to
warn Officers and Commanders of Ships, <HI>Supra
Cargoes,</HI> and such as are trusted in the Conduct of
the Voyage, never to have any Disputes among
themselves (I say not among themselves) about
the Course they shall take, or whither they shall
go; for it never fails to come among the Men
after them, and if once the Debate is but named
on the out-side of the Great Cabin Door, it be∣comes
immediately a Dispute among the Officers
upon the Quarter Deck, the Lieutenants, Mates,
Purser, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from thence it gets afore the Mast,
and into the Cook Room, and the whole Ship is
immediately divided into Factions and Parties;
every Foremast Man is a Captain, or a Director
to the Captain; every Boatswain, Gunner, Car∣penter,
Cockswain, nay, and even the Cook, sets
up for a Leader of the Men; and if two of them
join Parties, 'tis ten to one but it comes to a
Mutiny, and perhaps to one of the two last Ex∣tremes
of all Mutinies, <HI>viz.</HI> running away from
the Ship, or running away with the Ship.</P>
<P>Our Case was exactly thus, and had issued ac∣cording
for ought I know, if we had not been
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
in a Port, where we got Immediate Assistance,
and that by a more than ordinary Vigor in the
Management too.</P>
<P>I have mentioned the first time when we call'd
a Council about our Voyage at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and
how it was carried against my Opinion not to go
to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> but to go to the <HI>South Seas,</HI>
about by Cape <HI>Horn:</HI> As the Debate of this was
not at all conceal'd, the Officers of the Ship,
<HI>viz.</HI> the two Lieutenants and two Mates, the
Purser, and others, came in, and went out, and
not only heard all we said, but talk'd of it at Li∣berty
on the Quarter Deck, and where they
pleas'd, till it went among the whole Ship's
Crew. It is true, there came nothing of all this
at that time, because almost all the Votes being
against my Opinion, as I have said already, the
Ship's Company seem'd to join in naturally with
it, and the Men were so talked into the great
Prospects of Gain to themselves, by a Voyage to
the <HI>South Seas,</HI> that they look'd upon me, who at
the Bottom had the chief Direction of Things, to
be no body, and to have only made a ridiculous
Proposal, which was against all their Interest;
and I perceiv'd clearly after this, that they look'd
upon me with an evil Eye, as one that was
against their Interest; Nay and treated me with a
sort of Contempt too, as one that had no Power
to hurt them, but as one, that if Things were
left to me, would carry them on a Wild Goose
Chase they knew not whither.</P>
<P>I took no Notice of this at first, knowing that
in the Process of Things I should have Opportu∣nity
enough to let them know I had Power to
oblige them many ways; as also, that I had Au∣thority
sufficient to command the whole Ship,
and that the Direction of the Voyage was prin∣cipally
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
in me, tho' I being willing to do every
thing friendly, had too easily, and I may say, too
foolishly, put that to the Vote, which I had a
right to have commanded their Compliance with.
The ill Consequences of which, appear'd not, for
some time, but broke out upon the Occasion of
our new Measures, as you shall hear.</P>
<P>As soon as we had determin'd, <HI>as you have heard,</HI>
our Voyage among our selves, in the great Cab∣bin,
the <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> and Captain <HI>Mirlotte,</HI> as above,
went out upon the Quarter Deck, and began to
talk of it among the Officers, Midshipmen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and to give them their Due, they talk'd of it
very honestly, not with any Complaint of being
over-rul'd, or over-perswaded, or the like, but
as a thing that was fully agreed to among us in
the great Cabbin.</P>
<P>The Boatswain, a blunt, surly, bold Fellow,
as soon as he heard of it, <HI>very well, says he,</HI> so
we are all come back into Captain—'s blind
Proposal; why this is the same that every body
rejected at the <HI>Canaries;</HI> and now because we are
driven hither by contrary Winds, those Winds
must be a Reason why we must undertake a pre∣posterous,
ridiculous Voyage, that never any
Sailor would have propos'd, and that Man never
went before. What does Captain—think
that we can't find our way to the Coast of <HI>Ame∣rica</HI>
again? and because we have met with cross
Winds, we must never meet with fair ones? I
warrant him, let us but go up the Height of
St. <HI>Helena,</HI> we will loon reach the <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI>
and Port St. <HI>Julian</HI> again, and get into the <HI>South
Seas</HI> too, as others have done before us.</P>
<P>The Gunner took it from the Boatswain, and
he talks with one of the Midship Men in the same
Dialect. For my part, says he, I shipt my self
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
for the <HI>South Seas</HI> when I first came a board the
Ship, and in hopes of good Booty, and if we go
thither, I know nothing can hinder us, Wind
and Weather permitting: But this is such a Voy∣age,
as no Man ever attempted before; and
whatever he proposes can have nothing in it for
the Men, but horrid Fateague, violent Heats,
Sickness, and starving.</P>
<P>One of the Mates takes it from him, and he
says as openly, I wonder what <HI>a plague</HI> the rest
of the Gentlemen mean, they were all against
Captain—when he started this whimsical
Voyage before, and now they come all into it of
a sudden, without any Consideration; and so the
Project of one Man must ruin the most promising
Voyage in the World, and be the Death of above
two Hundred as stout Fellows as ever were toge∣ther
in one Ship in this part of the World.</P>
<P>One of the Midshipmen followed the Mate,
and said we were all promis'd that another Ship
should be gotten, either purchas'd or taken, and
that the first Ship we took, should be mann'd
and victualled out of this Ship, where we were
double mann'd and crowded together enough to
bring an Infection among us, in such hot Climates
as we are going into; and if we were in the <HI>South
Seas,</HI> we should easily buy a Ship, or take a Ship
for our Purpose, almost where we would; but
in all this part of the World there is no such
thing as a Ship fit for an <HI>English</HI> Man to set his
Foot in. We were promis'd too, that when we
got into such a Ship, we that enter'd as Midship∣men
should be preferr'd to Offices as we were
qualified, and as our Merit should recommend us.
What they are going to do with us now, I can't
imagine, unless it be to turn us a-fore the Mast
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
when half the Foremast Men are dead, and
thrown over Board.</P>
<P>The Master, or Pilot of the Ship, heard all
these Things, and sent us word into the great
Cabbin, of all that pass'd, and, in short, assured
us, that if these Things went a little farther, he
was afraid they would come up to a Mutiny;
that there was great Danger of it already, and
that we ought to apply some immediate Remedy
to it, or else he thought it would be too late:
He told me the Particulars also, and how the
whole Weight of their Resentment seem'd to
tend to a quarelling at my Command, as believing
that this Project of going to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> was
wholly mine; and that the rest of the Officers
being a little influenc'd by the Accident of our
being driven so far out of our way, were only bi∣ass'd
in the rest by my Opinion; and as they
were all against it before, would have been so
still if it had not been for me; and he fear'd, if
they went on, they might enter into some fatal
Measures about me, and perhaps resolve to set
me a shore in some barren, uninhabited Land or
other, to give me my Belly full of New Disco∣veries,
as it seems some of them had hinted, and
the second Mate in particular.</P>
<P>I was far from being insensible of the Danger
I was in, and indeed of the Danger the whole
Voyage, Ship and all, was in; for I made no
Question, but that if their brutish Rage led them
to one villainous Action, they would soon go on
to another; and the Devil would take hold of
that Handle to represent the Danger of their be∣ing
punish'd for it when they came home; and
so, as has been often the Case, prompt them to
Mutiny against all Command, and run away with
the Ship.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31"/>
However, I had presence of Mind enough to
enter into proper Measures for our general Safe∣ty,
and to prevent the worst in case of any At∣tempt
upon me, first I represented the Case to
the rest of the Gentlemen, and ask'd if they
would stand by me, and by the Resolutions which
we had taken for the Voyage; then I call'd in to
our Assistance, the chief Mate, who was a Kins∣man
of one of our Owners, a bold, resolute Gen∣tleman,
and the Purser, who we knew was faith∣ful
to us; as also, the Surgeon, and the Carpen∣ter:
I engag'd them all to give me first their
Opinions whether they were convinc'd of the
Reasonableness of my Scheme for the Voyage I
had propos'd; and that they might judge for
themselves, laid it all before them again, ar∣guing
every part of it so clearly to them, that
they were convinc'd entirely of its being the
most rational Prospect of the Voyage for us, of
any we could go about.</P>
<P>When I had done this, I recommended it to
them to expostulate with the Men, and, if pos∣sible,
to keep them in Temper, and keep them
to their Duty; but at the same time, to stand all
ready, and upon a Signal which I gave them, to
come all to the Steerage, and defend the great
Cabbin Door with all the other Hands, who they
could be sure of; and in the mean time, to be
very watchful over the Motions of the Men, and
see what they drove at.</P>
<P>At the same time, I fortified my self with the
<HI>French</HI> Captain, and the <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> and the
other Captain; and by the way, all the <HI>French</HI>
Captain's Men were true to him (and he true to us)
to a Man. We then brought a sufficient Store of
Ammunition and small Arms into the great Cab∣bin,
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
and secur'd the Steerage, as also the Round
House, so that we could not possibly be surpriz'd.</P>
<P>There was nothing done that Night, but the
next Morning I was inform'd, that the Gunner
and second Mate were in a close Cabal togerther,
and one or two of the Midshipmen, and that they
had sworn to one another, not that they would
not go the Voyage as was propos'd, for that
might have ended in their running away, which
I should not have been sorry for; but in short,
their Oath was, that the Ship should not go the
Voyage; by which I was presently to understand,
that they had some Measures to take to prevent
my Design of the Voyage to the <HI>Phillipines,</HI> and
that perhaps this was to run away with the Ship
to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> which was not far off.</P>
<P>I had however, this apparent Encouragement
in this Case, <HI>viz.</HI> that as the Contrivance was
yet but two Days old, for it was but two Days
since they had any Notice of our Intentions to go,
they would be some Days caballing and forming
an Interest among the Men, to make up a Party
strong enough to make any Attempt; and that
as I had a strong Set of Men who would be as
diligent the other way, they would be heaving
and contriving one way and the other way to get
the Men over to their Opinion, so that at least
it would be some time before they could make
their Party up.</P>
<P>The thing was rightly conjectured, and the
three Men above who had made themselves the
Head of the Mutineers, went on a pace, and my
Men encreased too, as much as could be desired for
the time; but the <HI>Friday</HI> after, which was about
five Days from the first Discovery, one of the
Midshipmen came and desir'd to speak with me,
and desir'd it might not, if possible, be known
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
that he was with me. I ask'd him if he desir'd
to be alone, he said no, I might appoint who I
thought convenient that I could trust, but that
what he had to say, was of the last Importance
to all our Lives, and that therefore he hop'd I
would be very sure of them who I trusted in such
a Case. Upon this I told him, I would name the
chief Mate, the <HI>French</HI> Captain, and the <HI>Supra
Cargo,</HI> and in the mean time, I bid him not be too
much surpriz'd, for that I had already some War∣ning
of the thing which I believ'd he had to tell me
of, and that I was preparing all <HI>Things</HI> to disappoint
it: That however I should not value his Fidelity
the less, and that he might speak freely his Mind
before those Men, for they were all in the Secret
already, and he might be sure both of Protection
and Reward.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I bid him go out upon the Quar∣ter
Deck, and walk there, and that when the
chief Mate went off into the Round House, he
should go down between Decks as if he was going
into his Cabbin to sleep, and that when he heard
the chief Mate call the Cabbin Boy, a Black of
mine, whose Name was <HI>Spartivento,</HI> he should
take that for a Signal that the Steerage was clear,
and he might come up, and should be let into the
great Cabbin; all which, was so manag'd, and
in so short a time, that he was with us in the
great Cabbin in a Quarter of an Hour after the
first Conference, and none of the Men per∣ceiv'd
it.</P>
<P>Here he let me into the whole Secret, and a
black Project it was; <HI>viz.</HI> That the second Mate,
the Gunner, three Midshipmen, the Coxswain,
and about six and thirty of the Men, had resol∣ved
to mutiny and seize upon all us who were in
the new Project, as they call'd it; and to confine
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
us first, then to set us on Shore, either there
where we were, or some where else, and so carry
the Ship away to the <HI>South Seas,</HI> and then to do
as they found convenient; that is to say, in a
Word, to seize upon me, the other Captain, the
<HI>French</HI> Captain, the <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> chief Mate,
Doctor, and Carpenter, with some others, and
run away with the Ship.</P>
<P>He told me, that they had not fully consulted
all their Measures, nor gain'd so many of the
Men as they intended; that they were to sound
some more of the Men the next Morning, and as
soon as they had made their dumber up fifty,
they were resolv'd to make the Attempt, which
they did not question would be by <HI>Thursday,</HI> and
this was <HI>Monday</HI> Morning; and that if they were
then ready, they would make the Onset at chan∣ging
the Watch the same Evening. He added,
That as they were to go on Shore the next Mor∣ning
for fresh Water, I should know the Truth
of it by this; that the second Mate would come
to me, and tell me that they wanted more Wa∣ter,
and to know if I pleased the Boats should go
on Shore, and that if I pleased he would go with
them, or any else who I pleas'd to appoint; and
that upon Supposition that I would leave it to
him, to take who he thought fit to go with him,
he would then take Occasion to choose the prin∣cipal
Conspirators, that they might when they
were on shore, consult their Measures for good
and all.</P>
<P>I had all that Day (<HI>Monday</HI>) to order my Pre∣parations,
and upon this plain Intelligence, I re∣solv'd
to lose no time, nor was it long before I
resolv'd what to do; for as their Design was de∣sperate,
so I had nothing but desperate Remedies
to provide. Having therefore, as I say, settled
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
my Measures, I call'd for the Cockswain, and bid
him man the Pinnace, for that I was to go on
Shore, and I appointed only the <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> and
the Surgeon, and the <HI>French</HI> Captain, to go
with me.</P>
<P>There were no <HI>English</HI> Ships in the Road, but
there were about five <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships homeward
bound waiting for more, and three outward
bound. As I pass'd by one of the outward bound
<HI>East India</HI> Ships, the <HI>French</HI> Captain, as we had
agreed before, pretended to know the Ship, and
that the Commander was his old Acquaintance,
and ask'd me to give him leave to visit him, and
told me he was sure he would make us all wel∣come.
I seem'd unwilling at first, telling him, I
intended to go on Shore and pay my Respects to
the Governor, and, as was usual, to ask him
leave to buy some Provisions, and that the Go∣vernor
would take it very ill if I did not go:
However, upon his alledging that we would not
stay, and that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain upon his going
on board, would, he was sure, give us a Letter
of Recommendation to the Governor, by which
we should have every thing granted that we could
desire. Upon this, and his Importunity, I seem∣ed
to consent, and we went all on board.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> who spoke <HI>Dutch</HI> very well,
hal'd the Ship, ask'd the Captain's Name, and
then ask'd if he was on Board; they answer'd
yes, then he bid them tell him the Captain of the
<HI>English</HI> Ship was come to visit him; upon which,
immediately their chief Mate bad them man the
side, and stood at the side to receive us, and before
we could get up, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain came upon
the Quarter Deck to meet me, and with great
Civility invited me into his Cabbin; and while
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
we were there, the chief Mate, by the Captain's
Order, entertain'd the Boats Crew with like Ci∣vility.</P>
<P>When we were in the Cabbin, Captain <HI>Mer∣lotte</HI>
told the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain that we came indeed
to him in the Form of a Visit, but that our Bu∣siness
was of the greatest Importance, and begg'd
we might speak to him of it in the hearing of
none but such as he could trust: The Captain
told us with the greatest open-heartedness ima∣ginable,
that tho' we were Strangers to him, yet
we look'd like honest Men, and he would grant
our Desire; we should speak it in the hearing of
none but those we could trust, for there should be
no body by but our selves.</P>
<P>We made him fully sensible that we knew
how obliging that Compliment was, but begg'd
he would admit any who he thought worthy to
be trusted with a Secret of the last Importance.
He then carried it as far t' other way, and told
us, that then he must call in the whole Ship's
Company, for that there was not a Man in the
Ship but he could trust his Life in his Hands.
However, upon the whole, he sent every Body
out of the Cabbin but us three and himself, and
then desir'd we would speak our Minds freely.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> who spoke <HI>Dutch,</HI> began,
but the Captain interrupted him, and ask'd if
the <HI>English</HI> Captain, (meaning me) spoke <HI>Dutch;</HI>
he said no, upon which he ask'd Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI>
if he spoke <HI>English,</HI> and he said yes, upon which
he let me know that he understood <HI>English,</HI> and
desir'd I would speak to him in <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>I was heartily glad of this, and began imme∣diately
with the Story, for we had time little
enough. I told him that he was particularly
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
happy, that as he said, could put his Life in the
Hand of any Man, the meanest in his Ship; that
my Men were unhappily the reverse of his; and
then beginning at the first of the Story, I gave
him a full Account of the whole, as related above.</P>
<P>He was extremely affected with it, and ask'd
me what he could do to serve me, and assur'd
me that he would not only do what in him lay,
but would engage all the Ships in the Road to
do the like, and the Governor also on Shore. I
thanked him very sincerely, and told him, that
what at present was the thing I thought lay be∣fore
me, was this, <HI>viz.</HI> that the chief Conspira∣tors
would be on Shore to morrow, with one, or
perhaps two, of our Boats, to fetch Water, and
get some fresh Provisions, and I would be very
glad to have them seiz'd upon by Surprize, when
they were on Shore, and that then I thought I
could master the rest on Board well enough.</P>
<P>Leave that to me, says he, I'll give the Gover∣nor
Notice this Evening, and as soon as they
come on Shore they shall be all seiz'd; but, says
he, if you think they may incline to make any
Resistance, I'll write a Line to the Governor,
and give it you now; then when your Men go on
Shore, order one or two of the principal Rogues
to go and wait on the Governor with the Letter
from you, and when he receives it, he shall se∣cure
them there; so they will be divided and ta∣ken
with the more Ease.</P>
<P>In the mean time, adds he, while this is doing
on Shore, I'll come on board your Ship, with
my Long Boat and Pinnace, and as many Men as
you please, to repay you the Compliment of this
Visit, and assist you in reducing the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38"/>
This was so kind, and so compleatly what I
desir'd, that I could have asked nothing more
or less; and I accepted his Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it in his Barge,
which I thought would be enough, but was afraid
that if more came, our Men might be alarm'd,
and take Arms before I was ready; so we agreed
upon that, and that if I desir'd more Help, I
should hang out a Signal, <HI>viz.</HI> a Red Antient on
the Mizen Top.</P>
<P>All Things being thus consulted, I return'd on
Board, pretending to our Men that I had spent
so much time on Board the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, that I
could not go on Shore; and indeed some of my
Men were so drunk, that they could scarce sit
to their Oars; and the Cockswain was so very
drunk, that I took Occasion to ask Leave pub∣lickly,
to leave him on Board till the next Day,
giving the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain also, a Hint that he
was in the Conspiracy, and I should be glad to
leave him on that Account.</P>
<P>The next Day about nine a Clock, the second
Mate came to me, and told me they wanted
more Water, and if I pleased to order the Boat
on Shore, he would go, if I thought fit, and see
if he could get any fresh Provisions, the Purser
being indisposed: I told him yes, with all my
Heart, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain last Night had
given me a Letter to the Governor, to desire we
might be furnish'd with whatever we had Occa∣sion
for, and that I had Thoughts of calling for
him to go on Shore and deliver it, and that per∣haps
the Governor might make him some Present
in Compliment to the <HI>English</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>He seem'd extremely pleas'd at this, and even
elevated, and going out to give Orders about the
Boat, order'd the Long Boat and the Shallop, and
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
came in again, and ask'd me who I pleas'd to have
go along with him; I answer'd, smilingly to
him, pick and choose them your self, only leave
the Pinnaces Crew that went with me yesterday,
because they must go on Board again to carry
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain a little Present of <HI>English</HI> Beer
that I am going to send him, and fetch a board
their drunken Cockswain, who was so drunk, we
was fain to leave him behind us.</P>
<P>This was just what he wanted; and we found
he chose all the chief Rogues of the Conspiracy;
such as the Boatswain, the Gunner, the Mid∣shipmen
we spoke of and such of the Foremost
Men as he had secur'd in his Design, and of the
rest, we judg'd they were in the Plot, because he
took them with him; and thus having the Long
Boat and the Shallop, with about six and thirty
Men with them, away they went to fill Water.</P>
<P>When they came on Shore, they had present∣ly
three <HI>Dutch</HI> Men, set by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain,
unperceiv'd by them, to be Spies upon them, and
to mark exactly what they did; and at the same
time, they found three Boats of <HI>Dutch</HI> Men at
the watering place, for the Captain had gotten
two Boats to go on Shore from two other Ships,
full of Men also, having acquainted them with
the Design. As soon as our Boats came on Shore,
the Men appear'd to be all very much engag'd
in something more than ordinary, and in stead of
separating, as it was expected they should, they
went all into one Boat, and there they were
mighty busy engag'd in Discourse one with ano∣ther.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain had given the Charge of
these Things to a brisk, bald Fellow, his Mate,
and he took the Hints the Captain gave him, so
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
well, that nothing could have been better; for
finding the Men thus in a kind of a Cabal, he
takes four of his Men with Muskets on their
Shoulders, like the Governor's Men, and goes
with them to the <HI>English</HI> Mens Boat, and asks for
their Officer, the second Mate, who upon this
appears: He tells them he comes from the Go∣vernor,
to know if they were <HI>English</HI> Men, and
what their Business was on Shore there: The
Mate answer'd, they came from an board the
<HI>English</HI> Ship, that they were driven there by
stress of Weather, and hoped they might have
Leave to fill Water and buy Necessaries for their
Money. He told them he suppos'd the Gover∣nor
would not refuse them when he knew who
they were, but that it was but good Manners to
ask leave: The <HI>English</HI> Man told him, that he
had not yet fill'd any Water, or bought any Pro∣visions,
and that he had a Letter to the Gover∣nor,
from the Captain, which he suppos'd was to
pay the usual Civilities to him, and to give him
the Civility of asking leave, as was expected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Man answer'd, that was <HI>Hael weel,</HI>
that he might go and carry it if he pleased then,
and if the Governor gave them Leave, all was
right and as it should be but that the Men
could not be admitted to come on Shore till his
Return. Upon this, away goes the second Mate
of our Ship, and three of the Men with him,
whereof the Gunner was one; for he had ask'd
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man how many he might carry with
him, and he told him three or four; and those
he took, you may be sure were of the particular
Men, who he had a Confidence in, because of
their conversing together by the way.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41"/>
When they came to the Governor, the Mate
sent in a Message first, <HI>viz.</HI> That he was come
from on board the <HI>English</HI> Ship in the Road, and
that he had a Letter from the Captain to his
Excellence. The Governor, who had Notice
given him of the Business, sends out word, that
the Gentlemen should send in the Letter, and
the Governor would give them an Answer: In
the mean time, there appear'd a Guard of Sol∣diers
at the Governor's House, and the four <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Men were let into the outer Room, where
the Door was shut after them, and the Soldiers
stood without the Door, and more Soldiers in
another Room between them and the Parlour
which the Governor sat in.</P>
<P>After some time, the Mate was call'd in, and
the Governor told him, that he had read the
Letter which he brought, and ask'd him, by an
Interpreter, if he knew the Contents of it; he
answer'd No: The Governor replied, he sup∣posed
not, for if he had, he would scarce have
brought it; at the same time told him, he was
oblig'd to make him and all his Men Prisoners, at
the Request of their own Captain, for a Conspi∣racy
to raise a Mutiny and run away with the
Ship. Upon which, two great fat <HI>Dutch</HI> Men
came up to him and bid him deliver his Sword,
which he did with some Reluctance; for he was
a stout, desperate, and strong Fellow; but he
saw it all to no purpose to dispute or resist.</P>
<P>At the same time, the three Men without were
made Prisoners also, by the Soldiers. When the
Governor had thus secur'd these Men, he call'd
them in and enquir'd the Particulars of the Case,
and expostulated with them very courteously up∣on
such a horrid, villainous Practise, and enquir'd
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
of them what the Occasion could be; and hear∣ing
all they had to say in their Defence, told
them he could do nothing in it more, till their
Captain came on Shore, which would be in a
Day or two, and that in the mean time, they
must be content to remain in Custody, which
they did, separated from one another. They
were very civilly treated, but strictly kept from
speaking with one another, or sending any Mes∣sages
to one another, or to the Boats.</P>
<P>When this was done, the Governor sent six
Files of Musqueteers down to the watering place,
with Order to secure all the <HI>English</HI> Men in the
two Boats, which was done. They pretended
to make some Resistance at first, being all very
well arm'd but the Seamen of the three <HI>Dutch</HI>
Long Boats, joining themselves to the Soldiers,
and Notice being given the <HI>English</HI> Seamen, that
if they fir'd one Gun, they should have no Quar∣ter,
and especially their two principal Men, the
chief Mate, and the Gunner, being absent, they
submitted, and were all made Prisoners also.</P>
<P>When this was done, of which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Cap∣tain
had Notice, by a Signal from the Shore, he
came off in his Shallop, with about sixteen Sea∣men,
and five or six Gentlemen and Officers, to
pay his Visit to me. I receiv'd him with all the
Appearance of Ceremony imaginable, caused a
handsome Dinner to be prepar'd for him, and
caus'd his Men to be all treated upon the Deck,
and made mighty Preparation for a Feast.</P>
<P>But in the Middle of all this, Captain <HI>Mer∣lotte,</HI>
with all his <HI>French</HI> Men, being thirty two,
appear'd in Arms on the Quarter Deck; the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Captain's Attendants stood to their Arms
on the Main Deck, and I, with the <HI>Supra</HI>
<PB REF="43" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
<HI>Cargo,</HI> the Doctor, and the other Captain, lea∣ving
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain and some Men in the
great Cabbin as a Reserve, came to the Steerage
Door, clear'd the Steerage behind me, and stood
there with a Cutlash in my Hand, but said no∣thing;
neither was there a Word spoke any
where all the while.</P>
<P>In this Juncture, the chief Mate, the faithful
Midshipmen, the Carpenter, and the Gunner's
Mate, with about twenty Men, who they could
trust, went fore and aft between Decks, and se∣cur'd
all the particular Men that we had the least
Suspicion of, being no less than thirty five more:
These they secur'd, bringing them up into the
Steerage, where their Hands were tyed behind
them, and they were commanded not to speak
one Word to one another, upon pain of present
Death.</P>
<P>When this was done, the chief Mate came to
me to the Steerage Door, and passing by, went
forward on with his Men, enter'd the Cook
Room, and posted himself at the Cook Room
Door. There might be still about eighty Men
upon the Forecastle, and Midships upon the open
Decks; and there they stood staring, and sur∣priz'd
at what was doing, but not being able to
guess in the least what was meant, what was the
Cause of it, or what was intended to be done
farther.</P>
<P>When I found all Things ready, I stept for∣ward
a Step or two, and beckoning to the Mate
to command Silence, I told the Men, that I was
not dispos'd to hurt any Man, nor had I done
what I now did, but by Necessity, and that I ex∣pected
they should all submit; that if any one
of them made the least Resistance, he was a dead
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
Man, but that if they would be easy and quiet,
I should give a very good Account to them all,
of every part of the Voyage, or Scheme of a Voy∣age
which I had laid, and which had been so ill
represented to them.</P>
<P>Then I caused my Commissionor Letter of Mart
to be read to them all, by which it appear'd, that
I was really chief Commander of the Ship, and
had a right to direct the Voyage as I thought
best; with a Paper of written Instructions, sigu'd
by the Owners and Adventurers, and directed
to me, with another Paper of Instructions to all
the Officers, to be directed by me in all Things;
which indeed, was all News to them, for they
did not think I was the chief Captain or Com∣mander
of the Ship and Voyage.</P>
<P>When I had done this, I gave them a long and
full Account of the Reasons why I thought it best
as our present Circumstances were stated, not to
go to the <HI>South Seas</HI> first, but to go away to the <HI>Phil∣lipine</HI>
Islands, and what great Prospect of Advan∣tage
to the Owners there was, as well as to the
Men; and that I wondered much that such Mea∣sures
were taking in the Ship as I heard there
were; and that I was not, they might see, un∣provided
of Means to reduce every one of them
to their Duty by Force, and to punish those that
were guilty as they deserv'd; but that I rather
desir'd to win them by Kindness; and that there∣fore
I had resolv'd, that if any of them had any
reason to dislike the Voyage, they should be fairly
set on Shore, and should go to the second Mate
and his Comrades: And as I named the second
Mate, I told them what Circumstances they were
in, and how effectually they were secur'd.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="46"/>
This astonish'd them, and surpriz'd them ex∣ceedingly,
and some of them enquir'd more par∣ticularly
into the Circumstances of the said second
Mate and his Fellows: I told them they were
safe enough, and should remain so: For as I could
prove they had all a villainous Design to run
away with the Ship, and set me on Shore, ei∣ther
here, or in a worse place, I thought that
only upon account of my own Safety, such Men
were not fit to go in the Ship, being once capa∣ble
to entertain such horrid, mischievous Thoughts,
or that could be guilty of such a Villany; and that
if any of them were of their Minds, they were
very welcome, if they thought fit, to go to them.
At this Word, some bold Rogues upon the Fore∣castle,
which I did not discern, by reason of the
Number that stood there, cried out <HI>One and all,</HI>
which was a Cry at that time of Mutiny and Re∣bellion,
that Was certain, and in its kind very
dangerous.</P>
<P>However, to let them see I was not to be
daunted with it, I call'd out to one of the Men
among them, who I saw upon the Forecastle;
you <HI>Jones, says I,</HI> tell me who that was, and come
away from them, for I'll make an Example of
him whoever 'tis, <HI>Will. Jones</HI> slunk in among the
rest, and made me no Answer, and immediately
<HI>One and all</HI> was cried again, and a little Huzza
with it, and some of the Men appear'd to have
some Fire Arms with them. There was a great
many of them, and I presently foresaw, that if I
went to the Extremity, I should spoil the Voy∣age,
tho' I conquer'd them; so I bridled my
Passion with all my Might, and said calmly, ve∣ry
well Gentlemen, let me know what it is you
mean by <HI>One and all;</HI> I offered any of you that
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
did not like to go the Voyage, might quit the
Ship, is that it you intend by <HI>One and all?</HI> If so,
you are welcome, and pray take care to do it im∣mediately;
as for what Chests or Clothes you
have in the Ship, you shall have them all with
you. Upon this I made the chief Mate, who
was now come to me again, advance a little with
some more Men, and get between the Men up∣on
the Forecastle, and those who were upon the
Main Deck; and, as if he had wanted Room,
when he was gotten between them, he said to
them, stand aft a little Gentlemen, and so crowd∣ed
them towards me.</P>
<P>As they came nearer and nearer to where I
stood, I had Opportunity to speak to them
singly, which I did calmly and smiling: <HI>Why how
now Tom,</HI> says I to one of them, what are you
among the Mutineers? <HI>Lord Sir,</HI> says <HI>Tom, not I,
they are mad I think, I have nothing to say to them;
I care not where I go, not I; I'll go round the Globe
with you, its all one to me.</HI> Well <HI>Tom, says I,</HI> but
what do you do among them then? come away
into the Steerage, <HI>and show your self an honest Man.</HI>
So <HI>Tom</HI> comes in, and after him another, and
then two more; upon my saying to <HI>Tom</HI> what do
you do among them, one of the Fellows says to
one of the Officers that stood at a little Distance
from me, what does the Captain mean by saying
among them, what does he reckon us to be in the
Plot? He is quite wrong, we are all ignorant,
and surpriz'd at it. He immediately tells me
this, and I was glad, you may be sure, to hear
it, and said aloud to the Man he spoke to, If they
are honest Men and would not appear in this
Villany, let them go down between Decks and
get out of the way, that they may have no Share
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
in the Punishment, if they have none in the
Crime. <HI>With all my Heart,</HI> says one <HI>God bless
you Captain,</HI> says another, and away they dropt
one by one in at the Steerage Door, and down
between Decks, every one to his Hammock or
Cabbin, till there was not above five, or six of
Them left.</P>
<P>By this time, our two Boats appear'd from the
Shore, being both mann'd with <HI>Dutch</HI> Men, <HI>viz.</HI>
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain's Mate and about twenty of
his Men, all the Water Casks full, but not a
Man of mine with them, for they were left a
Shore in safe Custody.</P>
<P>I waited till they came on Board, and then
turning to the Men on the Forecastle, I told
them they should go on Board the Boats imme∣diately,
as soon as the Buts of Water were hoist∣ed
in. They still said <HI>One and all,</HI> they were rea∣dy,
desir'd they might go and fetch their Clothes:
No no says I, not a Man of you shall set your
Foot any more into the Ship; but go get you in∣to
the Boats, and what is your own, shall be gi∣ven
you into the Boat.</P>
<P>As I spoke this in an angry Tone, and with
a kind of Passion, that look'd provok'd to a high
Degree, they began to see they had no Room to
choose; and some of them slipt down the Scuttle
into the Cook Room. I had order'd the Officer
who was there, who was one of the Midship∣men,
to wink at it, and let as many come down
as offered it, and the honest Man did more than
that; for he went to the Scuttle himself, and as
if he had whisper'd, so that I should not hear him,
call'd them one by one by their Names, and ar∣gued
with them: <HI>Prithee Jack,</HI> says he to one
of them, don't you be distracted and ruin your
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
self to gratify a rash drunken Humour; if you
go into the Boat you are undone you will be
seiz'd as soon as you come a Shore as the rest are,
and will be sent to <HI>England</HI> in Irons, and there
you will be infallibly hang'd; why you are cer∣tainly
all mad. <HI>Jack</HI> replies, he had no design to
mutiny, but the second Mate drew him in, and
he did not know what to do, he wish'd he had
not meddled, but he was undone, now what
could he do? <HI>Do,</HI> says the the Midship-man,
leave them for Shame, and slip down here, and
I'll see and get you off if I can. Accordingly
he pull'd him down, and after him so many got
out of Sight the same Way that there was not
above Seventeen or Eighteen left upon the Fore∣castle.</P>
<P>I seem'd to take no Notice of that, till at last
one of the Men that was left there with his Hat
or Cap in his Hand, stepping just to the Edge
of the Forecastle which was next to me, said,
with a very respectful Manner, That I saw how
many had slunk away and made their Peace, or
at least obtained Pardon, and that I might, per∣haps,
know that they who were left were only
such as had their Duty there, being placed there
of Course before the Mutiny began, and that
they had no Hand in it, but abhorr'd it with
all their Hearts, which he hoped I would con∣sider
and not joyn them with those that had of∣fended,
meerly because they came upon the
Forecastle and mix'd there with the Men who
had the Watch.</P>
<P>I told him if that was true it would be in
their Favour, but I expected he would prove it
to my Satisfaction before I accepted that for an
Excuse. He told me it might, perhaps, be
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
hard to prove it, seeing the Boatswain and his
Mate, and the second Mate were gone, but the
rest of the Ship's Crew could all testify that they
were a Part of the Men whose Watch it was,
and that they were upon the Forecastle by the
Necessity of their Duty and no otherwise, and
Call'd such and such Men who were upon Du∣ty
with them to witness it, who did confirm
it.</P>
<P>Upon this, I found my self under a Necessity,
in Justice to the Men, to approve it: But my
own Management was a Bite upon my self in it;
for tho' I did allow the Midship-men to wink
at their slipping away as before, yet I made no
Question but I should have some left to make
Examples of; but as I could not go back from
the Promise of Mercy which I had allow'd the
Midship-man to offer in my Name: So I trick'd
my self by their Mistake into a Necessity of
pardoning them all, which was very far from
my Design; but there was no Remedy.</P>
<P>However, the Men, when they were so hap∣pily
escaped, desired the Midship-men, who had
been instrumental to deliver them, to assure me,
that as they were sensible they had deserved ve∣ry
ill at my Hands, and that yet I had treated
them thus kindly, they would not only reveal
to me all the Particulars of the Conspiracy and
the Names of those principally concern'd in it,
but that they would assure me, they would ne∣ver
more dispute any of my Measures, but were
very ready to do their Duty as Seamen to what
Part of the World soever I might think fit to
go, or which Way I thought fit to carry them;
whether outward or homeward, and that they
gave me the tender of their Duty in this Man∣ner
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
with the utmost Sincerity and with Thank∣fulness
for my having forgiven them that Conduct
which was the worst that a Seaman could be
guilty of.</P>
<P>I took this very kindly, and sent them Word
I did so and that they should find they had
taken the wiser Course, that I had an intire Con∣fidence
in their Fidelity and that they should
never find I would reproach them with, or use
them the worse for what had past.</P>
<P>I must confess, I was very glad of this Sub∣mission
of the Men for tho' by the Measures I
had taken I was satisfied I should conquer them,
and that I was safe from their Attempts; yet
carrying it on by Resentment, and doing Ju∣stice
upon the Offenders, whatever Advantage
it had one Way, had this Disadvantage in the
Consequence; (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it would ruin the Voyage,
for at least half the Men were in the Plot.</P>
<P>But having thus conquer'd them by good U∣sage,
I thought my next Work was to enquire
into the Mistakes which had been the Foun∣dation
of all this: So before I parted with the
Men who had returned to their Duty, I told
them, that as I had freely forgiven what was
past, so I would keep my Word with them,
that I would never reproach them with it; but
that I thought it was necessary their Judgments
should be convinc'd how much they were im∣pos'd
upon, as well as their Tempers be re∣duced
by my Kindness to them. That I was of
the Opinion that they had been abused in the
Account given them of what I had design'd to
do, and of the Reasons I had to give for doing
it; and I would desire them to let me know af∣terwards,
whether they had been faithfully in∣form'd
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
of Things or not and whether in their
own Judgment, now when they were freed from
the Prepossessions they were under, they could
object any Thing against it or no.</P>
<P>This I did with Respect to the other Men
who I had made Prisoners in the Steerage, who
I had the same Design to be kind to as I had to
these; but upon whom I resolv'd to work this
Way, because, after all, I might have this
Work to do over again if I should meet with
any Disappointment or Miscarriage in the Voyage;
or especially if we should be put to any Straits
or Distress in the pursuing it.</P>
<P>In order to this, I caused the Voyage it self,
and the Reasons of it, the Nature of the Trade
I was to carry on by it, the Pursuit of it to
the <HI>South-Seas;</HI> and in a Word, every Thing
just as we had argued and settled it in the great
Cabbin, to be put into Writing and read to
them.</P>
<P>The Fellows, every one of them, declar'd
they were fully satisfied in the Voyages it self,
and that my Reasons for it were perfectly good;
and that they had received a quite different Ac∣count
of it; as that I would carry them into
the Island of the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> which was the most
unhealthy Part of the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> that I would
go away to the <HI>South</HI> for new Discoveries; and
that I would go away thence to the <HI>South-Seas;</HI>
which was a Voyage of such a Length that no
Ship could victual for; that it was impossible to
carry fresh Water such a Length; and in a Word;
that it was a Voyage that would destroy us
all.</P>
<P>It was the chief Mate and the Midship-man
who took them all down the Scuttle, that
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
brought me this Account from them; so I made
him take two of those penitent Mutineers with
him, and go to the Men in the Steerage, who
he had made Prisoners aqt first, and see whether
their Del<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions were of the same Kind, and what
kind of Temper they were in: Accordingly he
went to them directly, for this was not a Busi∣ness
that admitted giving them Time to club
and Cabal together, and form other Societies or
Combinations which might have Conseqnences
fatal to us still.</P>
<P>When he came to them, he told them, the
Captain was willing to do all the Justice possible
to his Men, and to use them on all Occasions
with Equity and Kindness; I ordered him to
enquire calmly what it was had mov'd them to
these Disorders, and what it was which they
had been made to believe was doing, that they
could enter into Measures so destructive to them∣selves,
and to those who had entrusted them all
with the Ship and Cargo; for that in a Voyage
every Foremast-man, in his Degree, is trusted
with the Safety of the whole Ship.</P>
<P>They answered it was the Mate; that they had
never shewn themselves discontented, much less
disorderly in the Ship; that they had on all
Occasions done their Duty thro' the whole
Voyage till now, and that they had no ill De∣sign
upon any one, much less had they any De∣sign
to destroy the Voyage or injure the Cap∣tain;
but that they were all told by the second
Mate, that the Captain had impos'd upon them,
that he had propos'd a mad Voyage to the <HI>South
pole</HI> that would murther them all, and that they
were to lay aside the Trading, and Cruising
Voyage which they came out upon, and were
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
now to spend the whole Voyage in new Disco∣veries;
by which the Men could propose nothing
to themselves but Hardships, and perhaps pe∣rishing
with Hunger and Cold; whereas, had
they gone to the <HI>South-Seas</HI> as was intended,
they might all have been made; and that the
Hazards with that Prospect, had some Sense
in them; whereas in this Project, there was no∣thing
but certain Destruction.</P>
<P>The Mate deliver'd them a Copy of the
Scheme I had propos'd, the Reasons of it, the
Trade I had design'd, the Return I was to make,
and every Thing as I have already mention'd
it, and bid them take it and consider of it.</P>
<P>As I was justly provoked to see how I had
been abused and misrepresented to the Men, so
they were astonish'd when they read my Scheme
and saw what Mischiefs they had been led into
for they know not what, and without any Rea∣son
or just Consideration: And after they had
debated Things a while among themselves, they
desir'd the chief Mate might come to them a∣gain,
which he did: Then they told him, that
as they had been thus grossly abus'd and drawn
into mischiefs which they never design'd, by such
plausible Pretences, and by being told such a
long Story full of Lies, and to carry on a
hellish Project of the second Mates; they hoped
then, being so much impos'd upon, would a lit∣tle
extenuate their Fault; than they were con∣vinc'd,
hat the Captain had propos'd nothing
but what was very rational, and a Voyage that
might be very profitable to the Owners and to
themselves and they entirely threw themselves
upon the Captain's Mercy, and humbly begg'd
Pardon; that if I pleas'd to forgive them, they
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
would endeavour to merit such Forgiveness by
their future Behaviour; and that in the mean
Time, they submitted to what Punishment I
pleas'd to lay upon them: And particularly,
that as they had forseited, by their Conspiracy,
all the Claim they had upon the Ship, and might
justly have been turn'd a-shore at the first Land
they came to, they were willing to fine a Dis∣charge
for all their Wages due to them, which
was now near eight Months a Man, and to be
considered for the rest of the Voyage as they de∣serv'd:
That they would all take a Solemn
Oath of Fidelity to me to do their Duty, to go
wherever I would carry them, and to behave
with the greatest Submission and Diligence, in
Hopes to regain my Favour by their future
Behaviour, and to shew their Gratitude for the
Pardon I should grant them.</P>
<P>This was indeed just as I would have it, for
I wanted nothing more than to have something
offered, which I might give them back again;
for I ever thought, and have found it by Expe∣rience
to be the best Way; and Men were al∣ways
secured in their Duty by a generous Kind∣ness,
better than by absolute Dominion and
Severity: Indeed my Opinion was justified in all
the Measures I took with these Men; for as I
found they were sufficiently humbled, and that
I had brought them low enough, I let them
know, that it was not their punishment but their
Amendment that I desired; that I scorn'd to
make a Prey of them, and take that Forfei∣ture
they had offer'd, so putting the Wages due
to them for their Labour in my Pocket. But I
sent them Word, I was very glad to hear that
they were sensible how much they had been
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
impos'd upon; that as it was not my Design to
offer any Thing to them, which they or any ho∣nest
Men ought to refuse, so it was not my Desire
to make any Advantages of their Follies, but what
might tend to bringing them back to their Duty;
that as I had no Prospect that was inconsistent
with their Safety and interest, so I scorn'd to make
a Profit of their Submission; that as to their Wa∣ges,
tho' they had forfeited it by their Mutiny,
yet God forbid I should make it my Profit:
and since forgiving their Offence was in my
Power, the Crime being in one Particular an
Offence against me, they should never be able
to say I made a Gain of their Submission, and
like the Pope should sell them my Pardon;
that upon their solemn engaging to me never
to offer the least Disturbance of any Kind in
the Ship for the future, but to do their Du∣ty
faithfully and Chearfully, I would forget all
that was past; only this I expected, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
two of them who were particularly guilty of
threat'ning the Life of Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> should
be punish'd as they deserv'd.</P>
<P>They could not deny but this was most just;
and they did not so much as offer to intercede
for those two: But when one of the two mov'd
the rest, they answer'd they could not do it,
for they had received Favour enough for them∣selves,
and they could not desire any Thing of
the Captain for their Sakes, for they had all
deserv'd Punishment as well as they.</P>
<P>In a Word, the two Men were brought to
the Geers, and soundly whipp'd and pickl'd; and
they all prov'd very honest ever after: And
these, as I said at first were two and thirty in
all.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57"/>
All this while Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> with his <HI>French</HI>
Men were in Arms, and had Possession on the
Quarter Deck to the Number of 23 stout Men;
I had Possession of the Main-deck with 18 Men
and the 16 <HI>Dutch</HI> Men, and my chief Mate,
with the Midship-man had possession of the
Cook-room and the Quarter-deck; the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Captain, our <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> the Surgeon, and the
other Captain kept the Great Cabbin, with a
Guard of 12 Musqueteers without the Door,
and about 8 more within, besides Servants.
Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI>'s Man also had a Guard of
eight Men in the Round-house. I had now
nothing to do but with my Men who were on
Shore; and of these, six of them were indiffer∣ence,
being Men not embark'd in the Design, but
carried on Shoar by the chief Mate, with a De∣sign
to engage them with him; so that indeed
they fell into a Punishment before they fell into
the Crime, and what to do with these Men
was the Case.</P>
<P>The first Thing I did, was to dismiss my Vi∣sitor
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain, who I had a great deal
of Reason to think my self exceedingly oblig'd
to: And first I handsomely rewarded his Men,
to whom I gave four Pieces of Eight a Man; and
having waited on the Captain to the Ship's Side
and seen him into his Boat, I fired him 21 Guns
at his going off; for which he fired 25 when
he came on board his Ship. The same After∣noon
I sent my Pinnace on board him for my
drunken Cockswain, and with the Pinnace I sent
the Captain three dozen Bottles of <HI>English</HI> Beer,
and a Quarter-cask of Canary, which was the
best Present I had to make him; and sent eve∣ry
one of his other Scamen a Piece of Eight
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
<HI>per</HI> Man; and indeed the Assistance I had from
the Ship deserv'd it; and to the Mate who
acted so bravely with my Men on Shore I sent
50 Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>The next Day I went on Shore to pay my
Respects to the Governour, when I had all the
Prisoners deliver'd up to me; the six Men I
caused to be immediately set at Liberty, as
having been innocent, and brought all the rest
on board tied Hand and Foot as Prisoners,
and continued them so a great while afterward
as you shall hear: As for the second Mate, I
tryed him formally by a Council of War, as
I was empower'd by my Commission to do, and
sentenced him to be hang'd at the Yard Arm:
And tho' I suspended the Execution from Day
to Day, yet I kept him in Expectation of the
Halter every Hour; which, to some, would have
been as grievous as the Hanging it self.</P>
<P>Thus we conquered this desperate Mutiny,
all principally proceeding from suffering the
private Disputes among our selves, which
ought to have been the <HI>Arcana</HI> of the
whole Voyage, and kept as secret as Death it
self could have kept it, I mean so, as not to
come among the Seamen afore the Mast.</P>
<P>We lay here 12 Days, during which Time,
we took in fresh Water as much as we had
Casks for, and was able to stow. On the 13th
Day of <HI>August</HI> we weighed and stood away
to the <HI>East,</HI> designing to make no Land any more
till we came to <HI>Java-Head,</HI> and the <HI>Streights</HI> of
<HI>Sunda;</HI> for that Way we intended to sail: But
the Wind sprung up at <HI>E.</HI> and at <HI>E. S. E.</HI> and
blew so fresh, that we was oblig'd, after two
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
Days beating against it, to bear away afore it,
and run back to the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope.</HI></P>
<P>While we were here, there came in two
<HI>Dutch East-India</HI> Men more, homeward bound,
to whom had happened a very odd Accident,
<HI>as follows:</HI> They had been attack'd by a large
Ship of 44 Guns, and a stout Sloop of 8 Guns;
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships resolving to assist one another,
stood up to the <HI>French</HI> Man, <HI>for such it seems he
was,</HI> and fought him very warmly. The En∣gagement
lasted six or seven Hours; in which
the Privateer had kill'd them some Men; but
in the Heat of the Fight, the Sloop receiv'd a
Shot, which brought her Main-mast by the
Board; and this caus'd the Captain of the Fri∣gate
to sheer off, fearing his Sloop would be
taken; but the Sloop's Men took Care of them∣selves,
for halling a little out of the Fight,
they got into their own Boats, and a Boat
which the Frigate sent to their Help, and a∣bandon'd
the Sloop; which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Men per∣ceiving,
they mann'd out their Boats, and sent
and took the Sloop with all that was in her,
and brought her away with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Men came into the Road at the Cape
with this Prize while our Ship was there the
second Time; and we saw them bringing the
Sloop in a Tow, having no Mast standing but
a little Pole-mast set up for the present, and
her Mizen; which was also disabled and of
little Use to her.</P>
<P>I no sooner saw her, but it came into my
Thoughts, that if she was any Thing of a Sea-Boat,
she would do our Business to a Tittle;
and as we had always resolved to get another
Ship, but had been disappointed, this would
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
answer our End exactly: Accordingly I went
with my chief Mate in our Shallop, on board
my old Acquaintance the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain, and
enquiring there, was inform'd of the Case, that
it was a Prize taken as above, and that in all
Probability the Captain that took her would be
glad to part with her; and the Captain pro∣mised
me to go on board the Ship that brought
her in, and enquire about it, and let me know.</P>
<P>Accordingly the next Morning, the Cap∣tain
sent me Word I might have her; that
she carried eight Guns, had good Store of Pro∣visions
on board, with Ammunition sufficient,
and I might have her and all that was in her
for 1200 Pieces of Eight. In a Word, I sent my
chief Mate back with the same Messenger and
the Money; giving him Commission to pay the
Money and take Possession of her if he lik'd
her, which he did; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain, my
Friend, lent him 12 Men to bring her off to
us; which they did the same Day.</P>
<P>I was a little put to it for a Mast for her,
having not any Thing on board that we could
spare that was sit for a Main-mast: But resolv∣ing
at last to mast her not as a Sloop, but as a
Brigantine, we made shift with what spare
Pieces we had, and a spare Fortop-mast, which
one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships help'd me to, so we sitted
her up very handsomely, made her carry twelve
Guns, and put 60 Men on board. One of the
best Things we found on board her, was Cask,
which we greatly wanted, especially for Barrel∣ling
up Beef and other Provisions, which we
found very difficult; but our Cooper eked them
out with making some new ones out of her
old ones.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61"/>
After staying here 16 Days more, we fail'd a∣gan
indeed, I thought once we should never have
gone away at all; for it is certain above half the
Men in the Ship had been made uneasy, and
there remained still some mis-understanding of
my Design, and a Supposition of all the frightful
Things the second Mate had put into their
Heads; and by his Means the Boatswain and
Gunner: As these three had the principal Ma∣nagement
of the Conspiracy, and that I had par∣don'd
all the rest, I had some Thoughts of
making an Example of these; I took Care to let
them know it too, in a Manner, that they had no
Room to think it was in jest, but that I intended
to have them all three hang'd; and I kept them
above three Weeks in Suspense about it:
However as I had no Intention to put them
to Death, I thought it was a Piece of Cruelty
something worse than Death to keep them
continually in Expectation of it, and in a Place
to where they had but little more than Room
to breath.</P>
<P>So having been 17 Days gone from the Cape,
I resolved to relieve them a little; and yet at
the same Time remove them out of the Way
of doing me any capital Injury, if they should
have any such Design still in their Heads: For
this Purpose I caused them to be removed out
of the Ship into the Brigantine, and there I per∣mitted
them to have a little more Liberty than
they had on board the great Ship; and where
two of them entered into another devilish Con∣spiracy,
as wild and foolish as ever I heard of,
or as, perhaps, was ever heard of; of which I
shall say more in its Place.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62"/>
We were now two Sail in Company, and we
went away from the Cape the third of <HI>Septem∣ber,
Anno.</HI> 1714. We found the Brigantine
was an excellent Sea-boat, and could bear the
Weather to a Miracle, and no bad Sailor; she
kept Pace with us on all Occasions, and in a
Storm we had at <HI>S. S. E.</HI> some Days after, she
shifted as well as we did in the great Ship, which
made us all in Love with her.</P>
<P>This Storm drove us away to the <HI>North∣ward;</HI>
and I once thought we should have been
driven back to the Cape again; which if it had
happen'd, I believe we should never have gone
on with the Voyage; for the Men begun to
murmur again, and say we were bewitch'd, that
we were beaten off first from the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI>
that we could never get round there, and
now driven back from the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Africa;</HI> so
that in short it look'd as if Fate had determined
this Voyage to be pursued no farther. The
Wind continued and blew exceeding hard; and
in short, we were driven so far to the <HI>North,</HI>
that we made the <HI>South</HI> Point of the Island of
<HI>Madagascar.</HI></P>
<P>My Pilot knew it to be <HI>Madagascar</HI> as soon as
he had a clear View of the Land, and having
beaten so long against the Sea to no Purpose,
and being in Want of many Things, we re∣solved
to put in; and accordingly made for
Port St. <HI>Agustive,</HI> on the <HI>West</HI> Side of the Island,
where we came to an Anchor in eleven fathom
Water, and a very good Road.</P>
<P>I could not be without a great many Anxious
Thoughts upon our coming into this Island; for
I knew very well that there were a Gang of
desperate Rogues here, especially on the <HI>Nor∣thren</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
Coast, who had been famous for their
Pyracies; and I did not know but that they
might be either strong enough as Pyrates, to
take us, or Rogues enough to entice a great
many of my Men to run away: So I resolv'd nei∣ther
to come near enough the Shore to be sur∣prized,
nor to suffer any of my Men to go on
shore, such excepted as I could be very secure
of.</P>
<P>But I was soon inform'd by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man who
came off to me with some of the Natives in a
kind of Canvas Boat, that there were no <HI>Euro∣peans</HI>
there but himself, and the Pyrates were on
the <HI>North</HI> Part of the Island; that they had no
Ship with them of any Force, and that they
would be glad to be fetch'd off by any Chri∣stian
Ship; that they were not above 200 in
Number, their chief Leaders, with the only
Ships of Force they had, being out a Cruising
on the Coast of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the Gulph of
<HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>After this, I went on Shore my self with
Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> and some of the Men who
I could trust; and we found it true as the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Man had related. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Man gave
us a long History of his Adventures, and
how he came to be left there by a Ship he came
in from <HI>Europe,</HI> which, he running up into the
Country for Sport, with three more of his Com∣rades
went away without them, and left them
among the Natives, who however used them
very well, and that now he serv'd them for
an Interpreter and a Broker, to bargain for
them with the <HI>European</HI> Ships for Provisions.
Accordingly he engag'd to bring us what Pro∣visions
we pleas'd, and propos'd, such Trinkets
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
in Return, as he knew the Natives desir'd, and
as were of Value little enough to us, but he
desir'd a Consideration for himself in Money,
which tho' it was of no use to him there, he
said, It might be hereafter; and as his De∣mand
was but 20 Pieces of Eight, we thought
he very well deserv'd it.</P>
<P>Here we bought a great Quantity of Beef,
which having no Casks to spare, we salted,
and then cur'd it in the Sun by the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Man's Direction, and it prov'd of excellent
Use to us thro' the whole Voyage, for we
kept some of it, till we came to <HI>England,</HI>
but it was then so hard, that a good Hatch∣et
would hardly cut it.</P>
<P>While we lay here, it came into my
Thoughts, that now was a good Time to
execute Justice upon my Prisoners, so I call'd
up the Officers to a Kind of Council of War,
and proposed it to them in general Terms,
not letting them know my Mind, as to the
Manner of it. They all agreed that it was
necessary, and the second Mate, Boatswain and
Gunner, had so much Intelligence of it from
the Men, that they prepar'd for Death, as
much as if I had sign'd a Dead Warrant for
their Execution, and that they were to be
hang'd at the Yard Arm. But in the Middle
of those Resolves, I told the Council of Offi∣cers,
my Design was, to the <HI>North</HI> Part of
the Island, where a Gang of Pyrates were
said to be settled, and that I was perswaded
I might get a good Ship among them, and
as many Men as we desir'd, for that I was
satisfied the greatest Part of them were so
wearied of their present Government, that they
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
would be glad of an Opportunity to come
away, and especially such as had either by
Force, or rash hasty Resolutions been as it
were surpriz'd into that sort of Life; that I
had been inform'd they were very far from
being in such a formidable Posture, as they
had been represented to us in <HI>Europe,</HI> or any
thing near so Numerous, but that on the
contrary we should find them poor, divided,
in Distress, and willing to get away upon any
Terms they could.</P>
<P>Some of the Officers of the Ship differ'd
from me in my Opinion; they had received
such Ideas of the Figure those People made
in <HI>Madagascar,</HI> from the common Report in
<HI>England,</HI> that they had no Notion of them, but
as of a little Common Wealth of Robbers; that
they were immensely rich, that Captain <HI>Avery</HI>
was King of the Island, that they were near
8000 Men, that they had a good Squadron
of stout Ships, and that they were able to
resist a whole Fleet of Men of War, having
a Harbour so well fortified at the Entrance
into it, that there was no coming at them
without a good Army for Land Service, and
the like.</P>
<P>I convinc'd them how impossible this was
to be true, and told them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all the Discourse
I had had with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man, at the Place
where I now was, who had had a full Account
of it from several of them, who had come
down to St. <HI>Augustines</HI> in little Boats, in order
to make their Escape from them, and to get
Passage for <HI>Europe;</HI> whom he had always assist∣ed,
and got them off, as any Ship touch at
that Port; and who all agreed in their Relati∣on
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
on of their Particulars, which were indeed mise∣rable
enough, saving that they wanted neither
Victuals or Clothes.</P>
<P>In a Word, I soon brought them to enter
into the Reason of it, and to be of my Opi∣nion,
and accordingly I ordered to get ready,
and in 3 days Time weigh'd, and stood away
for the <HI>North</HI> of the Island; for by the Way
we did not now communicate our Debates or
Resolves to the Men before the Mast, as had
been done defore, we had indeed had enough
of that already.</P>
<P>While we were thus coasting the Island, to
the <HI>North</HI> and in the Channel or Sea between
the Island and the Main of <HI>Africa,</HI> it came
into my Thoughts, that I might now make
Use of my Traytors to my Advantage and
their Own too, and that I might if they were
honest gain my End, and get a full Intelli∣gence
of the People I had my Eye upon, and
if they were still Traytors they would desert
and go over to the Pyrates, and I should be
well rid of them, without the Necessity of
bringing them to the Yard Arm; for I was
very uneasy in my Mind about hanging them
too, nor could I ever have been brought to
do it, I believe, whatever Risque I had run
from their mutinous Disposition.</P>
<P>I was now got in the Latitude of 15 De∣grees
and a half, <HI>South</HI> of the Lin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and began
to think of standing in for the Shore; when
I ordered the second Mate who lay in Irons in
the Brigantine, to be brought on Board the
great Ship, and to be call'd up into the great
Cabin. He came in great Concern, tho' he was
of himself a very bold and resolute Fellow, yet
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
as he made no doubt, that he was sent for
to Execution, he appear'd throughly soften'd,
and quite another Man, than he was before.</P>
<P>When he was brought in, I caused him to be
set down in a Nook of the Cabbin, where he
could not stir to offer any Violence to me, if he
had had any Will to it, two large Chests being
just before him; and I order'd all my People to
withdraw, except Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> and the <HI>Supra
Cargo;</HI> and then turning my self to the Criminal,
I told him he knew his Circumstances, I need not
repeat them, and the Fact for which he was
brought into that Condition; that I had hitherto
from time to time delay'd his Execution, con∣trary
to the Opinion of the rest of the chief Offi∣cers,
who in full Council had unanimously con∣demn'd
him; that I had a sudden Thought came
into my Head, which, if he knew how to merit
Mercy, and to retrieve his Circumstances by his
future Fidelity, might once again put it into his
Power, not only to save his Life, but to be trust∣ed
in the Ship again, if he inclined to be honest;
that however if he had no Inclination to merit by
his Service, I would put it to his Choice, either
to undertake with Courage and Fidelity what I
had to propose to him, in which Case he might
expect to be very well treated, or if not, I would
pardon him as to the Death he had Reason to
expect, and he, with his two Fellow Criminals,
should be set on Shore to go whither they pleas'd.</P>
<P>He waited, without offering to speak a Word,
till I made a full Stop, and then ask'd me if I
gave him Leave to answer; I told him yes; then
he ask'd if I gave him Leave to speak freely, and
would not take Offence at what he might say; I
told him he should speak as freely as if he had
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
never offended; and that as I had given him his
Life, I now would give him my Word nothing
he could say should revoke the Grant; and
that he should not only go freely on Shore,
<HI>for I expected by his Words that he had made that
Choice,</HI> but that I would give him the the Lives
of his two fellow Prisoners; and would give
them Arms and Ammunition, and any Thing
else that was reasonable for them to ask, or
necessary to their subsisting on Shore in such a
Country.</P>
<P>He told me then, that, had it been any other
Part of the World than at <HI>Madagascar,</HI> he would
readily have chosen to have gone on Shore; nay,
tho' the Place had been really desolate and un∣inhabited;
that he did not object because my Offer
was not very generous and kind, and it would
be always with regret that he should look back
upon the Mercy he should have received, and
how ill he had deserv'd it at my Hands.</P>
<P>But that, as it was at this Place that I men∣tioned
setting him at Liberty, he told me, that tho'
he had been mutinous and disorderly, for which
he acknowledg'd he had deserv'd to die, yet he
hop'd I could not think so ill of him as to believe he
could turn Pyrate; and begg'd that rather than
entertain such hard Thoughts of him, I would
execute the worst Part of the Sentence and
send him out of the World a Penitent, and an
honest Man; which he should esteem far better
than to give him his Life in a Condition in
which he could preserve it upon no other Terms
than those of being the worst of Villains: He
added, that if there was any Thing he could do
to deserve so much Mercy as I intended him,
he begg'd me that I would give him Room to
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
behave himself as became him, and he would
leave it wholly to me, to use him as he should de∣serve,
even to the recalling the Pardon that I had
granted him.</P>
<P>I was extremely satisfied with what he said,
and more particularly with the Manner of his
Speaking it: I told him I was glad to see that he
had a Principle of so much Honesty, at the Bot∣tom
of a Part so unhappy as he had acted; that
I would be very far from prompting him to
turn Pyrate, and much more from forcing him
to do so; and that I would according to his
Desire put an Opportunity into his Hands to
shew himself a new Man; and by his Fidelity
to wipe out all that was past: And then, with∣out
any more Ceremony, I told him my whole
Design, which was to send him, and four or five
more Men with him, on Shore among the py∣rates
as Spies, to see what Condition they were
in, and to see whether there was any Apprehen∣sions
of Violence from them, or whether they
were in the mean Circumstances that I had Rea∣son
to believe they were in; and lastly whether
they had any Ship or Vessel which might be
bought of them, and whether Men might be
had to encrease our Company; that is to say,
such Men as being penitent for their Rogueries,
and tyred with their Miscries, would be glad of
the Opportunity of turning honest Men before
they were brought to it by Distress and the Gal∣lows.</P>
<P>He embraced the Offer with the greatest rea∣diness,
and gave me all the Assaurances that I
could desire of his Fidelity. I then ask'd him
whether he thought his two fellow Prisoners
might be trusted upon the same Foot. He ask'd
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
me if I would take it for a Piece of Sincerity,
if after a Tryal, he should tell me his Mind, and
would not be displeased if he declined speaking
his Thoughts till he had talk'd with them: I
told him he should be at Liberty to give his
farther Answer after he had propos'd it to him;
but I insisted upon his Opinion first, because
it was only his Opinion that I ask'd now; where∣as
if he reported it to them, then he had no
more to do but to report their Answer. He
then ask'd me if I would please to grant him
one Thing; (<HI>viz.</HI>) that whatever his Opinion
should be, that what he should say should be no
Prejudice to them in their present Condition:
I told him it was a reasonable Caution in him,
and I would assure him, that whatever he said
should not do them any Prejudice; and to con∣vince
him of it, I gave him my Word that I
would not put them to Death on any Account
whatsoever merely for his Sake: He bow'd and
thank'd me very heartily for that Grant, which
he said oblig'd him to be the plainer with me
on that Head; and as he said, he would not
deceive me in any Thing whatever, so he would
not in this especially; and therefore told me, it
was his Opinion they would not serve me faith∣fully;
and he referr'd me to the Experience I
should find of it; and added, that he would be so
just to me in the beginning, as that while he
begg'd me to be merciful to them, yet for my
own Sake he would also beg me not to trust
them.</P>
<P>I took the Hint, and said no more at that
Time, but ordered his Irons to be taken off, and
ordred him to have leave to go to his former
Cabbin, and to have his Chests and Things re∣stored
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
to him; so that he was at full Liberty
in the Ship, tho' not in any Office, or appoin∣ted
to any particular Business. A Day or two
after this, we made Land, which appear'd to be
the <HI>North West</HI> Part of the Island, in the Lati∣tude
of thirteen Degrees thirty Minutes; and
now I thought it was Time to put our Design
in Execution; for I knew very well that it
could not be a great Way from this Part of
the Island where the Pyrates were to be heard
of: So I ordered the Boat on Shore, with about
sixteen Men, to make Discoveries, and with them
my new restored Man. I gave him no Instruc∣tion
for any thing extraordinary at this Time;
our Work now being only to find out where
they were: The Boat came on board again at
Night, for we had now stood in within two
Leagues of the Shore, and brought us an Ac∣count,
that there were no <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Europeans</HI>
at all thereabouts, but that they were to be heard
of a great Way farther: So we stood away to
the <HI>North</HI> all the Night, and the next Day, the
Wind being fair and the Sea smooth, and by
our Reckoning we went in that Time about
forty Leagues.</P>
<P>The next Evening, the same Company went
on Shore again, and were shew'd by some of
the Natives where the Pyrates inhabited; which
in short, was about five or six and twenty Miles
farther <HI>North</HI> still, in a River very commodious for
Shipping, where they had five or six <HI>European</HI>
built Ships, and two or three Sloops; but they
were all laid up, except two Sloops, with which
they cruised sometimes a great Distance off to
the <HI>North,</HI> as far as the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph: He
returned with this Intelligence the same Night;
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
and by his Direction, we stood in as close un∣der
the Shore, as we could conveniently, about
six Leagues farther <HI>North;</HI> here we found a ve∣ry
good Road under a little Cape, which kept
us perfectly undiscovered; and in the Morning
before Day, my Man went on Shore again with
the Boat, and keeping only four Men with him,
sent the Boat on board again, agreeing on a
Signal for us to send the Boat for him again
when he should return.</P>
<P>There was a pretty high Ledge of Hills to
the <HI>North</HI> of the Place where he landed, and
which running <HI>West</HI> made the little Cape under
the Lee of which our Ship rode at an Anchor
as above. As soon as he came to the top of
those Hills he plainly discovered the Creek or
Harbour where the Pyrate Ships lay, and where
they had form'd their Encampment on the Shore.
Our Men took such proper Observations of the
Scituation of the Place they were in, upon the
Hill, that they might not fail to find their Way
back again, tho' it were in the Night; and ha∣ving
agreed in the Account they should give of
themselves, so that they might be all found in
the same Tale. They boldly went down the
Hill, and came to the Edge of the Creek; the
Pyrates Camp being on the other Shore.</P>
<P>Here they fir'd a Gun to raise a kind of Al∣larm
among them, and then hanging out a
white Cloth on the top of a Pole, a Signal
of Peace, they Hail'd them in <HI>English,</HI> and ask'd
them if they would send a Boat and fetch them
over.</P>
<P>The Pyrates were surpriz'd at the Noise of the
Piece, and came running to the Shore with all
speed; but they were much surpriz'd when they
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
heard themselves Hail'd in <HI>English.</HI> Upon the
whole, they immediately sent a Boat to fetch them
over, and received them with a great deal of
Joy.</P>
<P>Our Men pretended to be overjoy'd at finding
them there, told them a long Story, that they
came on Shore on the <HI>West</HI> Side of the Island
where, not far off, there were two <HI>English</HI> Ships;
but that the Natives quarrelling with their Men,
upon some Rudeness offer'd to their Women;
and they being separated from their Fellows,
were oblig'd to fly, that the Natives had surroun∣ded
the rest, and they believ'd had kill'd them all;
that they wandred up to the top of the hill, in∣tending
to make Signals to their Ship, to send
them some Help; when seeing some Ships, they
believed some <HI>Europeans</HI> were there, and so came
down to take Shelter; and they begg'd of them
a Boat to carry them round the Cape to their
Comrades; unless they would give them Leave
to stay with them, and do as they did, which
they were very willing to do.</P>
<P>This was all a made Story; but however, the
Tale told so well, that they believ'd it thorow∣ly,
and received our Men very kindly, led them
up to their Camp, and gave them some Victu∣als.</P>
<P>Our Men observ'd they had Victuals enough,
and very good, as well Beef as Mutton; that
is to say, of Goats Flesh, which was excellent
good; also Pork and Veal, and they were tole∣rable
good Cooks too; for they found they had
built several Furnaces and Boilers, which they
had taken out of their Ships, and dress'd a vast
Quantity of Meat at a Time: But they observ'd
they had no Liquor; upon which, the Mate pull'd
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
a large Bottle of good Cordial Waters out
of his Pocket, and gave it about as far as it
would go, and so did two others of the Men
which their new Landlords took very kind∣ly.</P>
<P>They spent good Part of the first Day in look∣ing
about them, seeing the Manner of the Py∣rates
Living there, and their Strength; and soon
perceived that they were indeed but in a sorry
Condition every Way, except that they had Cat∣tle
and Flesh Meat sufficient. They had a good
Platform of Guns indeed, and a covered Place
pallisado'd round where they lodg'd their Am∣munition.
But as for Fortifications to the Land∣ward
they had none, except a double Pallisado
round their Camp, and a sort of a Bank thrown
up within to fire from, and stand covered from
the Enemies Lances, which was all they had to
fear from the Natives. They had no Bread but
what they made of Rice, and the Store they had
of that was very small: They told our Men in∣deed,
that they had two Ships Abroad, who they
expected back every Day with a Quantity of
Rice, and what else they could get; especially
with some Arack, which they were to Trade for
with the <HI>Arabian</HI> Merchants, or take it by
Force, which should first offer.</P>
<P>Our Men pretended to like their Way of
living mighty well, and talk'd of staying with
them, if they would let them, and thus they
pass'd the first Day of Conversation.</P>
<P>Our Men had two Tents or Hutts given them
to lodge in, and Hammocks hung in the Hutts
very agreeably, being such I suppose as be∣long'd
to some of their Company that were
dead, or were out upon Adventure, here they
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
slept very secure, and in the Morning walk'd
about, as Strangers might be suffer'd to do to
look about them, but my new Manager's Eye
was chiefly here upon two Things, <HI>1st.</HI> to see
if they had any Shipping for our Purpose, and
<HI>2ly.</HI> to see, if he could pitch upon one Man
more particular than the rest, to enter into
some Confidence with, and it was not long
before he found an Opportunity for both, the
Manner was thus;</P>
<P>He was walking by himself, having ordered
his other Men to straggle away, two and two,
this way and that, as if they had not minded
him, tho' always to keep him in Sight, I say,
he walk'd by himself towards that Part of the
Creek, where, as was said, three of their big∣est
Ships lay by the Walls, and when he came
to the Shore right against them, he stood still
looking at them very earnestly, while he was
here, he obsev'd a Boat put off from One of
them, with four Oars and one Sitter onely,
who they set on shore just by him, and then
put off again; the Person, who they set on
shore, was it seems, One, who had been with∣our
Men the evening before, but having some
particular Office on board one of those Ships,
lay on board every Night with about 10 or 12
Men, just to watch and guard the Ship, and
so came on Shore in the Morning, as is usual
in Men of War lay'd up.</P>
<P>As soon as he saw our Man, he knew him,
and spoke very familiarly to him, and seeing
he was looking so earnestly at the Ship, he
ask'd him, if he would go on board, our Man
faintly declin'd it, as on purpose to be ask'd
again, and upon just as much farther pressing
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
as was sufficient to satisfie him, that the Gun∣ner,
for that was his Office, was in earnest,
he yeilded, so the Gunner call'd back the
Boat, and they went on board.</P>
<P>Our Man view'd the Ship very particularly,
and pretended to like eve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry Thing he saw,
but, after some Conversation, asks him this
home Question, namely, why they did not go
to Sea, and seek Purchase, having so many
good Ships at their Command; he shook his
Head, and told him very frankly, that they
were in no Condition to undertake any thing,
for that they were a Crew of unresolv'd divi∣ded
Rogues; that they were never two Days
of a Mind, that they had no Body to com∣mand,
and therefore no Body to obey; that
several Things had been offer'd, but nothing
concluded, that in short they thought of no∣thing,
but of shifting every one for them∣selves,
as well as they could.</P>
<P>My Mate reply'd, he thought it had been quite
otherwise, and that made him tell them last
Night, that he had an Inclination to stay with
them; I heard you say so, said the Gunner, and
it made me smile; I thought in my self, that
you would be of another Mind, when you
knew us a little better, for in a Word said
he, if they should agree to lend you a Boat
to go back to your Ship, they would go toge∣ther
by the Ears, about who should go with
you, for not a Man of them, that went with
you, would ever come back again hither, if
your Captain would take them on board, tho'
the Terms were to be hang'd, when they
came to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77"/>
My Mate knew that this was my Opinion
before, but he was realy of another Mind him∣self,
till he saw things, and till he talk'd with
this Gunner, and this put new Things in his
Head; so he entertain'd the Gunner with a
Scheme of his own, and told him, if it was so
as he related it, and that he had really a mind
to come off from that Gang, he believ'd, that
he could put him in a way how to do it to
his Advantage, and to take a Set of his People
with him, if he could pick out some of them
that might be depended upon.</P>
<P>The Gunner reply'd, that he could pick out
a Set of very brave Fellows, good Seamen,
and most of them such, as having been forc'd
into the Pyrates Ships, were drag'd into that
wicked Life they had lived, not onely against
their Consciences, but by a meer Necessity to save
their Lives, and that they would be glad at
any Price to come off: The Mate ask'd him,
how many such he could answer for, he told
him above a hundred; upon this the Mate
told him the Circumstances we were in, the
Voyage we were upon, that we were a Letter
of <HI>Mart</HI> Ship of such a Force, but that we
were over mann'd and double stor'd, in hopes
of getting a good Ship upon our Cruise, to
man out of the other, that we had been dis∣appointed,
and had only got the Sloop or
Brigantine which we bought, as before, at the
Cape, that if he could perswade the Men, to
sell us one of their Ships, we would pay them
for it in ready Money, and perhaps entertain
100 of their Men into the Bargain.</P>
<P>The Gunner told him, he would propose it:
to them, and added in positive Terms, that
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
he knew it would be readily accepted, and
that he should take which of the three Ships
I pleas'd; the Mate then desir'd, that he would
lend them his Shallop to go on board our Ship,
to acquaint me with it, and bring back suffici∣ent
Orders to treat; he told him, he would
not only do that, but before I could be ready
to go, he would propose it to the chief Men
that he had his Eye upon, and would have
their Consent, and that then he would go a∣long
with him on board to make a Bargain.</P>
<P>This was as well as our Mate could expect,
and the Gunner had either so much Authority
among them, or the Men were so forward to
shift their Station in the World, that the
Gunner came again to our Mate in less than
two hours, with an Order, sign'd by about
sixteen of their Officers, empowering him to
sell us the Ship, which the Gunner was on
board of, and to allot so many Guns, and
such a Proportion of Ammunition to her, as
was sufficient, and to give the Work of all
their Carpenters for so many Days, as were
necessary to repair her, Calk, and grave her,
and put her in Condition to go to Sea.</P>
<P>She was a <HI>Spanish</HI> built Ship, where they had
her, the Gunner said he did not know; but
she was a very strong tight Ship, and a pretty
good Sailor. We made her carry two and thirty
Guns, tho' she had not been used to carry above
twenty-four.</P>
<P>The Gunner being thus impower'd to treat
with my Mate, came away in their Shallop, and
brought the said Gunner and and two more of
their Officers with him and eight Seamen.
The Gunner and I soon made a Bargain for the
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
Ship, which I bought for five thousand Pieces
of Eight, most of it in <HI>English</HI> Goods, such as
they wanted; for they were many of them al∣most
naked of Clothes; and as for other Things
they had scarce a pair of Stockings or Shoes a∣mong
them. When our Bargain was made, and
the Mate had related all the Particulars of the
Conference he had had with the Gunner, we
came to talk of the People who were to go with
us: The Gunner told us that we might in∣deed
have good Reason to suspect a Gang of
Men who had made themselves infamous all over
the World by so many Pyracies and wicked Ac∣tions:
But if I would put so much Confidence
in him, he would assure me, that as he should
have the Power in his Hands to pick and chuse
his Men, so he would answer Body for Body for
the Fidelity of all the Men he should chuse;
and that most, if not all of them, would be
such as had been taken by Force out of other
Ships, or wheedl'd away when they were drunk:
And in a Word, he told me, there never was a
Ship-load of such Penitents went to Sea toge∣ther
as he would bring us: when he had said so,
he began to move me that I would please to give
him the same Post which he held in the Ship;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) of Gunner, which I promised him; and
then he desir'd I would permit him to speak
with me in Private; I was not at first very
free to it, but he having consented to let the
Mate and Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> be present, I yield∣ed.</P>
<P>When all the rest were withdrawn, he told
me, that having been five Years in the Pyrates
Service, as he might call it, and being obliged to
do as they did, I might be sure he had some small
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
Share in the Purchase; and however, he had
come into it against his Will, yet as he had been
oblig'd to go with them, he had made some Ad∣vantage;
and that being resolv'd to leave them,
he had a good while ago pack'd up some of the
best of what he had got, to make his Escape,
and begg'd I would let him deposite it with me
as a Security for his Fidelity. Upon this, he or∣der'd
a Chest to be taken out of the Shallop, and
brought into my great Cabbin; and besides this,
gave me out of his Pocket, a Bag seal'd up, the
Contents of which, I shall speak of hereafter.</P>
<P>The Shallop return'd the next Day, and I sent
back the Mate with my Long Boat and twenty
four Men, to go and take Possession of the Ship,
and appointed my Carpenter to go and see to the
Repairs that were necessary to be done to her:
And some Days after, I sent Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> with
the <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> in our Sloop, to go and secure
the Possession, and to cover the Retreat of any
of the Men that might have a Mind to come
away, and might be oppos'd by the rest: And
this was done at the Request of the Gunner, who
foresaw there might be some Squabble about it.</P>
<P>They spent six Weeks and some odd Days in
sitting out this Ship, occasioned by the want of
a convenient place to lay her on Shore in, which
they were oblig'd to make with a great deal of
Labour, however, she was compleatly sitted up:
When she was sitted, they laid in a good
Store of Provisions, tho' not so well cur'd as to
last a great while; One of the best Things we
got a Recruit of here, was Casks, which <HI>as be∣fore</HI>
we greatly wanted, and which their Coopers
assisted us to trim, season, and sit up.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81"/>
As to Bread, we had no Help from them
for they not only had none but what they made
of Rice, but they had no sufficient Store of that,
as I have hinted before.</P>
<P>But we had more to do yet: For when the
Ship was sitted up, and our Men had the Pos∣session
of her, they were surpriz'd one Morning
on a sudden, with a most horrible Tumult among
the Pyrates; and had not our Brigantine been at
hand, (as above) to secure the Possession, I believe
they had taken the Ship from our Men again, and
perhaps have came down with her and their two
Sloops, and have attack'd us. The Case was
this,</P>
<P>The Gunner, who was a punctual Fellow to
his Word, resolv'd that none of the Men should
go in the Ship, but such as he had singl'd out;
and they were such, as were generally Men taken
out of Merchants Ships, by Force, as before:
But when he came to talk to the Men of who
and who should go, and stay; truly they wou'd
all go, to a Man, there was not a Man of them
wou'd stay behind; and, in a Word, they fell
out about it, to that Degree, that they came to
Blows, and the Gunner was forced to fly for it,
with about twenty two Men that stood to him,
and six or seven were wounded in the Fray,
whereof two died.</P>
<P>The Gunner being thus driven to his Shifts,
made down to the Shore to his Boat, but the
Rogues were too nimble for him, and had got to
his Boat before him, and prepar'd to man her
and two more, to go on Board and secure the
Ship: In this Distress, the Gunner, who had ta∣ken
Sanctuary in the Woods at about a Mile di∣stance,
but unhappily above the Camp, so that
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
the Platform of Guns was between him and the
Ship, had no Remedy, but to send one of his Men
who swam very well, to take a Compass round
behind the Pyrates Camp, and come to the Wa∣ter
side below the Camp and Platform, so to take
the Water and swim on Board the Ship, which
lay near a League below their said Camp, and give
our Men Notice of what had happened, to warn
them to suffer none of their Men to come on
Board, unless the Gunner was with them, and if
possible, to send a Boat on Shore to fetch off the
Gunner and his Men, who were following by the
same way, and would be at the same place, and
make a Signal to them to come for him.</P>
<P>Our Men had scarce receiv'd this Notice, when
they saw a Boat full of Men put off from the
Platform, and row down under Shore towards
them: But as they resolv'd not to suffer them to
come on Board, they call'd to them by a Speak∣ing
Trumpet, and told them they might go back
again, for they should not come on Board, nor
any other Boat, unless the Gunner was on Board.</P>
<P>They row'd on for all that, when our Men
call'd to them again, and told them, if they of∣fer'd
to put off, in order to come on Board, or in
short, to row down Shore any farther than a lit∣tle
Point which our Man nam'd, and which was
just a head of them, they would fire at them:
Well, they row'd on for all this, and that tho'
they were past the Point; which our Men seeing,
they immediately let fly a Shot, but fir'd a little
a head of them, so as not to hit the Boat, and
this brought them to a stop; so they lay upon
their Oars a while, as if they were considering
what to do; when our Men perceiv'd two Boats
more come off from the Platform likewise, full
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
of Men, and rowing after the first. Upon this,
they call'd again to the first Boat with their
Speaking Trumpet, and told them if they did
not all go immediately on Shore, they would
sink the Boat. They had no Remedy, seeing our
Men resolv'd, and that they lay open to the
Shot of the Ship; so they went on Shore accor∣dingly,
and then our Men fir'd at the empty Boat,
till they split her in Pieces, and made her useless
to them.</P>
<P>Upon this firing, our Brigantine, which lay
about two Leagues off in the Mouth of a little
Creek, on the <HI>South</HI> of that River, weigh'd im∣mediately,
and stood away to the opening of the
Road where the Ship lay, and the Tide of Flood
being still running in, they drove up towards
the Ship for her Assistance, and came to an An∣chor
about a Cables Length a head of her, but
within Pistol shot of the Shore; at the same time
sending two and thirty of her Men on Board the
great Ship to re-inforce the Men on Board, who
were but sixteen in Number.</P>
<P>Just at this time, the Gunner and his twenty
one Men, who heard the firing, and had quick∣ened
their Pace, tho' they had a great Compass
to fetch, thro' Woods and untrod Raths, and
some Luggage to carry too, were come to the
Shore, and made the Signal, which our Men in
the Ship observing, gave Notice to the Officer of
the Brigantine to fetch them on Board, which he
did very safely; by the way, as the Officer after∣wards
told us, most of their Luggage consisted
in Money, with which it seems every Man of
them was very well furnish'd, having shared their
Wealth at their first coming on Shore: As for
Clothes, they had very few, and those all in
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
Rags; and as for Linnen, they had scarce a Shirt
among them all, or Linnen enough to have made
a white Flag for a Truce, if they had had Occa∣sion
for it: In short, a Crew so rich and so rag∣ged,
were hardly ever seen before.</P>
<P>The Ship was now pretty well mann'd, for the
Brigantine carried the Gunner and his twenty one
Men on Board her; and the Tide by this time
being spent, she immediately unmoor'd, and
loos'd her Top Sails, <HI>which, as it happen'd, had
been bent to the Yards two Days before,</HI> so with
the first of the Ebb, she weigh'd and fell down
about a League farther, by which she was quite
out of Reach of the Platform, and rid in the open
Sea; and the Brigantine did the same.</P>
<P>But by this Means, they miss'd the Occasion of
the rest of the Gunner's Men, who having got
together to the Number of between seventy and
eighty, had follow'd him and come down to the
Shore, and made the Signals, but were not un∣derstood
by our Ship, which put the poor Men
to great Difficulties; for they had broken away
from the rest by Force, and had been pursued
half a Mile by the whole Body, and particularly
at the Entrance into a very thick, woody place,
were so hard put to it, that they were oblig'd to
make a desperate stand, and fire at their old
Friends, which had exasperated them to the last
Degree. But as the Case of these Men was des∣perate,
they took an effectual Method for their
own Security, of which I shall give a farther Ac∣count
presently.</P>
<P>The general Body of the Pyrates were now up
in Arms, and the new Ship was, as it were, in open
War with them, or at least they had declar'd War
against it: But as they had been disappointed
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
in their Attempt to force it, and found they were
not strong enough at Sea to attack it, they sent
a Flag of Truce on Board. Our Men admit∣ted
them to come to the Ship side, but as my
Mate, who now had the Command, knew them
to be a Gang of desperate Rogues that would at∣tempt
any thing, tho' never so rash, he order'd
that none of them should come on Board the
Ship, except the Officer and two more, who
gave an Account that they were sent to treat
with us. So we call'd them the Ambassadors.</P>
<P>When they came on Board, they expostulated
very warmly with my new Agent the second
Mate, that our Men came in the Posture of
Friends, and of Friends too in Distress, and had
receiv'd Favours from them, but had abused the
Kindness, which had been shewn them; that they
had bought a Ship of them, and had had Leave and
Assistance to sit her up and furnish her; but had
not paid for her, or paid for what Assistance and
what Provisions had been given to them: And
that now to compleat all, their Men had been
partially and unfairly treated, and when a cer∣tain
Number of Men had been granted us, an in∣ferior
Fellow a Gunner was set to call such and
such Men out, just who he pleased, to go with
us; whereas the whole Body ought to have had
the appointing who they wou'd or wou'd not give
Leave to, to go in the Ship: That when they
came in a peaceable manner to have demanded
Justice, and to have treated amicably of these
Things, our Men had denied them Admittance,
had committed Hostilities against them, had fir'd
at their Men and stav'd their Boat, and had af∣terward
receiv'd on Board their Deserters, all
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
contrary to the Rules of Friendship. And in all
these Cases they demanded Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Our new Commander was a ready Man
enough, and he answer'd all their Complaints
with a great deal of Gravity and Calmness: He
told them, that it was true we came to them as
Friends, and had receiv'd friendly Usage from
them, which we had not in the least dishonour'd;
but that as Friends in Distress, we had never
pretended to be, and really were not; for that
we were neither in Danger of any thing, or in
Want of any thing; that as to Provisions, we
were strong enough, if need were, to procure
our selves Provisions in any part of the Island, and
had been several times supplied from the Shore
by the Natives, for which we had always fully
satisfied the People who furnish'd us; and that
we scorn'd to be ungrateful for any Favour we
should have receiv'd, much less to abuse it, or
them for it.</P>
<P>That we had paid the full Price of all the Pro∣visions
we had receiv'd, and for the Work that
had been done to the Ship, that what we had bar∣gain'd
for, as the Price of the Ship, had been paid,
as far as the Agreement made it due, and that
what remain'd, was ready to be paid as soon as
the Ship was finished, which was our Bargain.</P>
<P>That as to the People who were willing to take
Service with us, and enter themselves on Board,
it is true, that the Gunner and some other Men
offered themselves to us, and we had accepted
of them, and we thought it was our part to ac∣cept
or not to accept of such Men as we thought
fit. As for what was among themselves, that
we had nothing to do with; that if we had been
publickly warn'd by them not to have entertain'd
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
any of their Men, but with Consent of the whole
Body, then indeed we should have had Reason
to be cautious; otherwise, we were not in the
least concern'd about it. That it is true, we re∣fused
to let their Boats come on Board us, being
assured that they came in a hostile manner, either
to take away the Men by Force, which had been
entred in our Service, or perhaps even to seize
the Ship it self; and why else was the first Boat
follow'd by two more full of Men, arm'd and
prepar'd to attack us; that we not only came in
a friendly manner to them, but resolv'd to con∣tinue
in Friendship with them, if they thought
fit to use us as Friends; but that considering
what part of the World we were in, and what
their Circumstances were, they must allow us to
be upon our Guard, and not put our selves in a
Condition to be used ill.</P>
<P>While he was talking thus with them in
the Cabbin, he had ordered a Can of Flip to
be made, and given their Men in the Boat,
and every one a Dram of the Bottle, but
would not suffer them to come on board; how∣ever
one or two of them got leave to get in at
one of the Ports, and got between Decks among
our Men; here they made terrible Complaints
of their Condition, and begg'd hard to be enter∣tain'd
in our Service; they were full of Money,
and gave twenty or thirty Pieces of Eight a∣mong
our Men, and by this Present pre∣vail'd
for two Men to speak to my Mate,
who appear'd as Captain to take the Boat's
Crew on board; the Mate very gravely told
the two Ambassadors of it, and told them,
that seeing they were come with a Flag of
Truce, he would not stop their Men, without
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
their Consent, but the Men being so earnest, he
thought, they would do better not to oppose
them; the Ambassadors, as I call them, oppos'd
it however vehemently, and at last desir'd to go
and talk with the Men, which was granted them
readily; When they came into their Boat,
their Men told them plainly, that <HI>One and all</HI>
they would enter themselves with their Country
Men, that they had been forc'd already to turn
Pyrates, and they thought, they might very just∣ly
turn honest Men again by Force, if they
could not get Leave to do it peaceably; and that
in short, they would go on Shore no more; that
if the Ambassadors desir'd it, they would set
them on Shore with the Boat, but as for them∣selves,
they would go along with the new Cap∣tain.</P>
<P>When the Ambassadors saw this, they had no
more to do, but to be satisfied, and so were set
on Shore, where they desir'd, and their Men
staid on Board.</P>
<P>During this Transaction, my Mate had sent
a full Account to me of all that had pass'd, and
had desir'd me to come on board, and give far∣ther
Directions in all that was to come; so I took
our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> and Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> along with
me, and some more of our Officers, and went to
them; it was my Lot to come on board, just
when those famous Ambassadors were talking
with my Mate, so I heard most of what they had to
say, and heard the Answer my Mate gave them,
as above, which was extremely to my Satisfacti∣on;
nor did I interrupt him, or take upon me
hny Authority, tho' he would very submissively
aave had me shewn my self, as Captain, but I
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
bid him go on, and sat down, as not concern'd it
the Affair at all.</P>
<P>After the Ambassadors were gone, the first
thing I did, was, in the Presence of all the Com∣pany,
and having before had the Opinion of those
I brought with me, to tell my second Mate, how
well we were all satisfi'd with his Conduct, and to
declare him, Captain of the Ship, that he was
in; only demanding his solemn Oath, to be under
Orders of the great Ship, as Admiral; and to
carry on no separate Interest from us, which h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
thankfully accepted, and to give him his Due, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
faithfully perform'd, all the rest of our very long
Voyage, and thro' all our Adventures.</P>
<P>It was upon my seeming Intercession, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
gave Consent to the Boat's Crew, who brough
the Ambassadors, to remain in our Service, and
set their Statesmen on shore; and in fine, I told
him, that as far as about one hundred and fifty
or two hundred Men, he should entertain wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
he thought fit; thus having settl'd all things it
the Ship to our Satisfaction, we went back to
our great Ship the next day.</P>
<P>I had not been many hours on board our Ship
but I was surprz'd with the fireing of three Mus∣quets
from the Shore; we wondred what should
be the meaning of it, knowing, that it was at
unusual Thing in that Place, where we knew th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Natives</HI> of the Country had no Fire-Arms, so we
knew not what to make of it, and therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
took no Notice of it, other than as I say, to won∣der
at it; about half an hour after that, we hear∣d
three Musquets more, and still not knowing any∣thing
of the Matter, we made them no Return
to the Signal; some Time after, three Muskets
were fir'd again, but all was one, we took n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
Notice, for we knew nothing, of what Return
was to be made to it.</P>
<P>When Night came on, we observ'd two great
Fires upon two several Hills, on that Part of the
Shore, opposite to us, and after that, three Rock∣ets
were fir'd, such as they were, but they went
off ill; I suppose their Gunner was ill provided
for such Things, but all signified nothing; we
would ha' made any Return to them, that had
been to be understood, but we knew nothing of
any agreed Signal; however I resolv'd, that
in the Morning I would send a Boat on Shore,
well mann'd, to learn if possible, what the Mean∣ing
of all this was; and accordingly in the Morn∣ing,
I sent our long Boat and Shallop on Shore,
with two and thirty Men in them both, to get
Intelligence; ordering them if possible, to speak
with some Body, before they went on Shore, and
know, how things stood; that then, if it was a
Party of the Pyrates, they should, by no means,
come near them, but parley at a Distance, till
they knew, what the Meaning of it all was.</P>
<P>As soon as my Men came near the Shore, they
saw plainly, that it was a Body of near an hundred
of the Pyrates, but seeing them so strong, they
stood off, and would not come nearer, nor near
enough, to parly with them, upon this the Men
on Shore, got one of the Islanders Canvas Boats,
or rather, Boats, made of Skins, which are but
sorry ones at best, and put off with two Men, to
manage the Sail, and one Sitter, and two Pad∣dles
for Oars, and away they came toward us,
carrying a Flag of Truce, that is to say, an old
white Rag; how they came to save so much Lin∣nen
among them all, was very hard to say.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="91"/>
Our Men could do no less, than receive their
Amdassador, and a Flag of Truce gave no Shad∣dow
of Apprehension, especially considering the
Figure they made, and that the Men on Shore
had no other Boats to surprize or attack us with;
so they lay by upon their Oars, till they came up,
when they soon understood who they were; <HI>viz.</HI>
that they were the Gunner's selected Men, that
they came too late, to have their Signal perceiv'd
from the other Ship, which was gone out of fight
of the Place they were directed to; that they had
with great Difficulty, and five Days and Nights
marching, got thro'a woody and almost unpassable
Country to come at us; that they had fetch'd a
Circuit of near an hundred Miles, to avoid being
attack'd by their Comrades, and that they were
pursued by them, with their whole Body, and
therefore they beg'd to be taken on board; they said
if they should be overtaken by their Comrades,
they should be all cut in Peices, for that they had
broke away from them by Force, and moreover
had been oblig'd at the first of their Pursuit, to
face about, and fire among them, by which they
had kill'd six or seven of them, and wounded
others, and that they had sworn, they would
give them no Quarter, if they could come fairly
up with them.</P>
<P>Our Men told them, they must be contented
to remain on Shore, where they were, for some
Time, for that they could do nothing, till they
had been on board, and acquainted their Captain
with all the particulars, so they came back im∣mediately
to me for Orders.</P>
<P>As to me, I was a little uneasy at the Thoughts
of taking them on board; I knew they were a
Gang of Pyrates at best, and what they might do
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
I knew not, but I sent them this Message, that
tho' all their Tale might be very good for ought
I knew, yet that I must take so much Time, as
to send an Express to the Captain of the other
Ship, to be inform'd of the Faith of it; and that
if he brought a satisfactory Answer, I would send
for them all on board.</P>
<P>This was very uncomfortable News to them,
for they expected to be surrounded every Hour by
their Comrades, from whom they were to look for
no Mercy; however seeing no Remedy, they re∣solv'd
to march about twenty Miles farther <HI>South,</HI>
and lie by in a Place near the Sea, where we
agreed to send to them; concluding, that their
Comrades not finding them near the place where
we lay, would not imagine, they could be gone
farther that way; As they guess'd, so it prov'd,
for the Pyrates came to the Shore, where they
saw Tokens enough of their having been there,
but concluded, that seeing they could not be
found there, they were all gone on board our
Ship.</P>
<P>The Wind proving contrary, it was no less
than four Days before our Boat came back, so
that the poor Men were held in great Suspence:
But when they returned, they brought the Gun∣ner
with them, who had selected those Men from
all the rest for our new Ship; and who, when he
came, gave me a long Account of them, and
what Care he had taken to pick them out for our
Service, delivering me also a Letter from my
new Captain to the same Purpose: Upon all
which concurring Circumstances, we concluded
to take them on board; so we sent our Boats for
them, who at twice brought them all on board,
and very stout honest Fellows they were.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="93"/>
When they had been on board some Days and
refresh'd themselves, I concluded to send them
all on board the new Ship; but upon Advice, I
resolved to send sixty of my own Men joyn'd to
forty of these, and keep thirty four of them on
board my Ship; for their Number was just se∣venty
four, which with the Gunner and his twen∣ty
one Men, and the sixteen Men who came
with the worthy Embassadors, and would not go
on Shore again, made one hundred and twelve
Men; and as we all thought were enough for us,
tho' we took in between forty and fifty more
afterwards.</P>
<P>We were now ready to go to Sea, and I caused
the new Ship and the Brigantine to come away
from the Place where they lay and joyn us; which
they did, and then we unloaded Part of our
Provisions and Ammunition; of which, as I ob∣serv'd
at first, we had taken in double Quantity;
and having furnished the new Ship, with a Pro∣portion
of all Things necessary, we prepar'd for
our Voyage.</P>
<P>I should here give a long Accuont of a second
devilish Conspiracy, which my two remaining
Prisoners had form'd among the Men; which
was to betray the new Ship to the Pyrates: But
'tis too long a Story to put in here; nor did I
make it publick among the Ship's Company: But
as it was only, <HI>as it were,</HI> laid down in a Scheme,
and that they had no Opportunity to put it in
Practice, I thought it was better to make as little
Noise of it as I could. So I order'd my new
Captain, <HI>for it was he who discovered it to me,</HI> to
punish them in their own Way, and without ta∣king
Notice of their new Villanies, to set them
on Shore, and leave them to take their Fate
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>
with a Set of Rogues, who they had intended
to joyn with, and whose Profession was likely,
some Time or other, to bring them to the Gal∣lows.
And thus I was rid of two incorrigible
Mutineers; what became of them afterwards I
never heard.</P>
<P>We were now a little Fleet, (<HI>viz</HI>) two large
Ships and a Brigantine, well mann'd, and fur∣nish'd
with all sorts of Necessaries for any
Voyage or any Enterprize that was fit for Men
in our Posture to undertake; and particularly
here, I made a full Design of the whole Voyage,
to be again openly declared to the Men, and had
them ask'd, One by One, if they were willing
and resolv'd to undertake it, which they all very
chearfully answered in the Affirmative.</P>
<P>Here we had Opportunity to furnish our selves
with a vast Stock of excellent Beef, which as I
said before, we cur'd with little or no Salt, by
drying it in the Sun; and I believe we laid
in such a Store, that in all our three Vessels we
had near an hundred and fifty Tun of it; and
it was of excellent Use to us, and serv'd us
thro' the whole Voyage: There was little else
to be had in this Place that was fit to be carried
to Sea; except, that as there was plenty of Milk,
some of our Men that were more dexterous than
others, made several large Cheeses; nor were
they very far short of <HI>English</HI> Cheese, only that
we were but indifferent Dairy-Folks: Our Men
made some Butter also, and salted it to keep, but
it grew rank and oily, and was of no Use to
us.</P>
<P>It was on the fifteenth of <HI>December</HI> that we
left this Place, a Country fruitful, populous,
full of Cattle, large and excellent good Beef,
<PB N="92" REF="95"/>
and very fat; and the Land able to produce all
Manner of good Things; but the People wild,
naked, black, barbarous, perfectly untracta∣ble,
and insensible of any State of Life being
better than their own.</P>
<P>We stood away toward the Shore of <HI>Arabia,</HI>
till we past the Line, and came into the Lati∣tude
of eighteen Degrees <HI>North,</HI> and then stood
away <HI>East,</HI> and <HI>E.</HI> by <HI>N.</HI> for the <HI>English</HI> Facto∣ries
of <HI>Surrat,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Malabar;</HI> not
that we had any Business there, or design'd any,
only that we had a mind to take on Board a
Quantity of Rice, if we could come at it; which
at last we effected by a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vessel, which we
met with at Sea, bound to <HI>Goa</HI> from the Gulph
of <HI>Persia.</HI> We chas'd her and brought her too
indeed, as if we resolv'd to attack and take the
Ship; but finding a Quantity of Rice on Board,
which was what we wanted, with a Parcel of
Coffee; we took all the Rice, but paid the <HI>Su∣pra
Cargo,</HI> who was a <HI>Persian</HI> or <HI>Armenian</HI> Mer∣chant,
very honestly for the whole Parcel, his full
Price, and to his Satisfaction: As for the Coffee we
had no Occasion for it: We put in at several Ports
on the <HI>Indian</HI> Coast for fresh Water, and fresh
Provisions, but came near none of the Factories,
because we had no mind to discover our selves;
for tho' we were to sail thro' the very Center of
the <HI>India</HI> Trade, yet it was perfectly without any
Business among them. We met indeed on this
Coast with some Pearl Fishers, who had been in
the Mouth of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph, and had a
large Quantity of Pearl on Board. I would have
traded with them for Goods, but they understood
nothing but Money, and I refus'd to part with
it: Upon which, the Fellows gave our <HI>Supra
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
Cargo</HI> some scurvy Language, which, tho' he did
not well understand what they said, yet he pre∣tended
to take it as a great Affront, and threatned
to make Prize of their Barks, and Slaves of the
Men; upon which, they grew very humble; and
one of them, a <HI>Malabar Indian,</HI> who spoke a lit∣tle
<HI>English,</HI> spoke for them, that they would wil∣lingly
trade with us for such Goods as we had;
whereupon I produced three Bales of <HI>English</HI>
Cloth, which I shew'd them, would be of good
Merchandise at <HI>Gombaroon</HI> in the Gulph, for that
the <HI>Persians</HI> made their long Vests of such
Cloths.</P>
<P>In short, for this Cloth, and some Money, we
bought a Box of choice Pearls, which the Chief
of them had pick'd out from the rest for the
<HI>Portuguese</HI> Merchants at <HI>Goa;</HI> and which, when
I came to <HI>London,</HI> was valued at two thousand
two hundred Pound Sterling.</P>
<P>We were near two Months on our Voyage
from <HI>Madagascar</HI> to the Coast of <HI>India,</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Ceylon,</HI> where we put in, on the <HI>South
West</HI> Part of the Island, to see what Provisions
we could get, and to take in a large Supply of
Water. The People here we found willing to
supply us with Provisions; but withal, so sharp,
imposing upon us their own Rates for every
Things; and withal, so false, that we were often
provoked to treat them very rudely. Howe∣ver,
I gave strict Orders that they should not be
hurt upon any Occasion; at least, 'till we had fill'd
all our Water Cask, and taken in what fresh
Provisions we could get, and especially Rice,
which we valued very much: But they provok'd
us at last beyond all Patience; for they were
such Thieves when they were on Board, and such
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
treacherous Rogues when we were on Shore,
that there was no bearing it; and two Accidents
fell out upon this Occasion, which fully broke the
Peace between us; one was on Board, and the o∣ther
was on Shore, and both happened the same
Day. The Case on Board was this; there came on
Board us a small Boat, in which was eleven Men
and three Boys, to sell us Roots, Yams, Mangoes,
and such Stuff as it was frequent for them to do
every Day; but this Boat having more Goods of
that Kind than usual, they were longer than or∣dinary
making their Market: While they were
thus Chaffering on Board, one of them having
wandred about the Ship, and pretending to
admire every Thing he saw, and being gotten
between Decks, was taken stealing a Pair of
Shoes, which belong'd to one of the Seamen;
the Fellow being stopt for his Theft, appear'd
angry, raised a hideous skreaming Noise to al∣larm
his Fellows; and at the same Time, having
stolen a long Pair of Cissars, pull'd them out,
and stabb'd the Man that had laid hold of him
into the Shoulder, and was going to double his
Blow, when the poor Fellow that had been
wounded, having struck up his Heels aud fallen
upon him, had kill'd him, if I had not call'd to
take him off, and bring the Theif up to me.</P>
<P>Upon this Order, they took up the <HI>Barbarian,</HI>
and brought him up with the Shoes and the Cis∣sars
that he had stolen, and as the Fact was plain,
and needed no Witnesses, I caused all the rest
of them to be brought up also; and as well as we
could, made them understand what he had done.
They made pitiful Signs of Fear, least they
should all be punished for his Crime, and par∣ticularly
when they saw the Man, who he had
<PB N="95" REF="98"/>
wounded brought in; then they expected no∣thing
but Death, and they made a sad Lementa∣tion
and Howling, as if they were all to die im∣mediately.
It was not without a great deal of
Difficulty that I found Ways to satisfy them,
that no Body was to be punished but the Man that
had committed the Fact; and then I caused him
to be brought to the Geers, with a Halter about
his Neck, and be soundly whipp'd; and indeed
our People did scourge him severely from Head
to Foot; and I believe, if I had not run my self
to put an End to it, they had whipp'd him to
Death.</P>
<P>When this Execution was over, they put him
into their Boat and let them all go on Shore: But
no sooner were they on Shore, but they raised a
terrible Hubbub among all the Villages and
Towns near them, and they were not a few, the
Country being very Populous; and a vast Multi∣tude
of them came down to the Shore, staring
at us, and making confused ugly Noises, and a∣bundance
of Arrows they shot at the Ship, but
we rode too far from the Shore for them to do us
any Hurt.</P>
<P>While this was doing, another Fray happen'd
on Shore, where two of our Men Chaffering
with an Islander and his Wife for some Fowls,
they took his Money, or what else it was he was
to give, and gave him Part of the Fowls, but
they pretended the Woman should go and fetch
the rest, while the Women was gone, three or
four more of the same Sort came to the Man
that was left, and talking a while together,
seeing they were so many, and our Men but
two, they began to take hold of the Fowls they
had sold, and would take them away again; at
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
which, one of our Men step'd up to the Fellow
that had taken them up, and went to lay hold of
him, but he was too nimble for him, and ran
away and carried off the Fowls and the Money
too. The Seamen was so enrag'd to be serv'd so,
that he took up his Piece, for they had both
Fire Arms with them, and fir'd immediately af∣ter
him, and aim'd his Shot so luckily, that tho'
the Fellow flew like the Wind, he shot him
thro' the Head, and he drop'd down dead up∣on
the Spot.</P>
<P>The rest of them, tho' terribly frighted, yet
seeing our Men were but two, and the Noise
bringing twenty or thirty more immediately to
them, attack'd our Men with their Lances, and
Bows and Arrows; and in a Moment, there was a
pitch'd Battle of two Men only against twenty
or thirty, and their Number encreasing too.</P>
<P>In short, our Men spent their Shot freely a∣mong
them as long as it lasted, and kill'd six or
seven, besides wounding ten or eleven more;
and this cool'd their Courage, and they seem'd
to give over the Battel; and our Men, whose
Ammunition was almost spent, began to think
of retreating to their Boat, which was near a
Mile off, for they were very unhappily gotten
from their Boat so far up the Country.</P>
<P>They made their Retreat pretty well for about
half the Way, when, on a sudden, they saw they
were not pursued only, but surrounded, and that
some of their Enemies were before them. This
made them double their Pace, and seeing
no Remedy, they resolv'd to break thro' those
that were before them, who were about eleven
or twelve: Accordingly, as soon as they came
within Postol shot of them, one of our Men
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
having, for want of Shot, put almost a Hand∣ful
of Gravel and small Stones into his Piece, and
fired among them, and the Gravel and Stones
scattering, wounded almost all of them; for they
being naked from the Waste upwards, the least
Grain of Sand scratch'd and hurt them, and made
them bleed if it did but touch them.</P>
<P>Being thus compleatly scar'd, and indeed more
afraid than hurt, they all run away, except two
who were really wounded with the Shot or
Stones, and lay upon the Ground: Our Men let
them lye, and made the best of their Way to their
Boat; where, at last, they got safe, but with
five hundred of the People at their Heels; their
Fellows did not stay to fire from the Boat, but
put off with all the Speed they could, for fear
of their poison'd Arrows, and the Country Peo∣ple
pour'd so many of their Arrows into the
Boat after them, and aim'd them also so true,
that two of our Men were hurt with them; but
whether they were poison'd or no, our Surgeons
cur'd them both.</P>
<P>We had enough of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and having no Bu∣siness
to make such a Kind of War as this must
have been, in which we might have lost, but
could get nothing, we weigh'd and stood away
to the <HI>East;</HI> what became of the Fellow that
we lash'd, we know not; but as he had but little
Flesh left on his Back, which was not mangled,
and torn with our whipping him, and we sup∣pose,
they are but indifferent Surgeons, our
People said the Fellow could not live: and the
Reason they gave for it, was because they did
not pickle him after it. Truly, they said, that
they would not be so kind to him as to pickle
him: For tho' Pickling, that is to say, throwing
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
Salt and Vinegar on the Back after the whipping
be cruel enough, as to the Pain it is to the Pati∣ent,
yet 'tis certainly the Way to prevent Mor∣tification,
and causes it to heal again with the
more Ease.</P>
<P>We stood over from <HI>Ceylon E. S. E.</HI> cross the
great Bay of <HI>Bngal,</HI> leaving all the Coast o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Coromandel,</HI> and standing directly for <HI>Anchin</HI>
on the <HI>North</HI> Point of the great Island of <HI>Sumatra</HI>
and in the Latitude of six Degrees thirty on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Minutes <HI>North.</HI></P>
<P>Here we spread our <HI>French</HI> Colours, and com∣ing
to an Anchor, suffer'd none of our Men to
go on Shore but Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> and his <HI>French</HI>
Men; and having nothing to do there, or any
where else in the <HI>Indian Seas,</HI> but to take in Pro∣visions
and fresh Water, we staid but five Days
in which Time, we supply'd our selves with
what the Place would afford; and pretending to
be bound for <HI>China,</HI> we went on to the <HI>South,</HI>
thro' the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> between the
Island of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and the <HI>Main or Isthmus</HI> of
<HI>Malacca.</HI></P>
<P>We had here a very difficult passage, tho' we
took two Pilots on Board at <HI>Anchin,</HI> who pre∣tended
to know the Streights perfectly well; twice
we were in very great Danger of being lost, and
once our <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship was so entangled a∣mong
Rocks and Currents, that we gave her
up for lost, and twice she struck upon the Rocks,
but she did but touch, and went clear.</P>
<P>We went several Times on Shore among the
<HI>Malayans,</HI> as well on the Shore of <HI>Malacca</HI> it self,
as on the Side of <HI>Sumatra:</HI> They are a fierce,
cruel, treacherous, and merciless Crew of hu∣mane
Devils as any I have met with on the Face
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
of the whole Earth; and we had some Skirmi∣shes
with them, but not of any Consequence:
We made no Stay any where in this Streight,
but just for fresh Water, and what other fresh
Provisions we could get, such as Roots, Greens,
Hogs and Fowls, of which they have Plenty and
a great Variety: But nothing to be had but for
ready Money; which our Men took so unkindly,
and especially their offering two or three Times
to cheat them, and once to murther them; that
after that, they made no Scruple to go on Shore
a hundred or more at a Time, and plunder and
burn what they could not carry off; till at last
we began to be such a Terror to them, that
they fled from us wherever we came.</P>
<P>On the fifth of <HI>March</HI> we made the
<HI>Southermost</HI> Point of the <HI>Isthmas</HI> of <HI>Mallacca;</HI> and
the Island, and Streights of <HI>Sincapore,</HI> famous for
its being the great Outlet into the <HI>Chinese Sea,</HI>
and lying in the Latitude of one Degree fifteen
Minutes <HI>North</HI> Latitude.</P>
<P>We had good Weather thro' these Streights,
which was very much to our Comfort; the dif∣ferent
Currents, and Number of little Islands,
making it otherwise very dangerous, especially
to Strangers: We got by very good Luck, a <HI>Dutch</HI>
Pilot ta carry us thro' this Streight, who was a
very useful skilful Fellow, but withal so very
impertinent and inquisitive, that we knew not
what to say to him nor what to do with him: At
last he grew saucy and insolent, and told our
chief Mate, that he did not know but we might
be Pyrates, or at least Enemies to his Country∣men
the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and if we would not tell him
who we were, and whither we were bound,
he would not Pilot us any farther.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="103"/>
This I thought very insolent, to a Degree be∣yond
what was sufferable; and I bid the Boat∣swain
put a Haller about the Fellow's Neck,
and tell him, that the Moment he omitted to
direct the Steerage as a Pilot, or the Moment
the Ship came to any Misfortune, or struck up∣on
any Rock, he should be truss'd up. The
Boatswain, a rugged Fellow, provides himself
with a Halter, and coming up to the Pilot, ask'd
him, <HI>What it was he wanted to be satisfied in?</HI> The
Pilot said, he desired to have a true Account
whither we were going: <HI>Why,</HI> says the Boat∣swain,
<HI>we are a going to the Devil, and I shall send
you before to tell him we are coming;</HI> and with that,
he pulls the Halter out of his Pocket, and puts
it over his Head; and taking the other End of
it in his Hand, <HI>Come,</HI> says the Boatswain, <HI>come
along with me; do you think we can't go thro' the
Streight of</HI> Sincapore <HI>without your Help; I warrant
you,</HI> says he, <HI>we will do without you.</HI></P>
<P>By this Time, you may suppose, the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Man to be in a mortal Fright, and half choak'd too
with being drag'd by the Throat with the Hal∣ter,
and full heartily he begg'd for his Life: At
Length, the Boatswain, who had pull'd him a∣long
a good Way, stopp'd, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man
fell down on his Knees; but the Boatswain said,
he had the Captain's Orders to hang him, and
hang him he would, unless the Captain recall'd
his Orders; but that he would stay so long, if
any Body would go up to the Captain, and tell
him what the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man said, and bring back
an Answer.</P>
<P>I had no Design to hang the poor Fellow, you
may be sure, and the Boatswain knew that well
enough: However, I was resolv'd to humble
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>
him effectually, so I sent back two Men to the
Boatswain; the first was to tell the Boatswain
aloud, that the Captain was resolv'd to have
the Fellow hang'd, for having been so impudent
to threaten to run the Ship a-Ground: But then
the second, <HI>who was to stay a little behind,</HI> was to
call out, as if he came since the first from me,
and that I had been prevail'd with to pardon him,
on his Promises of better Behaviour: This was
all acted to the Life; for the first Messenger
call'd aloud to the Boatswain, that the Captain
said he would have the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man hang'd for
a Warning to all Pilots, and to teach them not
to insult Men when they are in Difficulties, as the
Midwives do Whores in Travel, and won't de∣liver
them till they confess who is the Father.</P>
<P>The Boatswain had the End of the Halter
in his Hand all the while; <HI>I told you so, says he,
before, come, come along MYNHEER,</HI> says he, <HI>I
shall quickly do your Work,</HI> and put you out of your Pain;
and then he dragg'd the poor Fellow along to
the Main-mast: By this Time the second Mes∣senger
came in and delivered his Part of the
Errand, and so the poor <HI>Dutch</HI> Man was put out
of his Fright, and they gave him a Dram to re∣store
him a little, and he did his Work very
honestly afterwards.</P>
<P>And now we were got loose again, being in
the open Sea, which was what we were very
impatient for before. We had now a long Run
over that Part which we call the Sea of <HI>Borneo,</HI>
and the upper Part of the <HI>Indian Arches,</HI> call'd
so for its being full of Islands, like the <HI>Archi∣pelague</HI>
of the <HI>Levant.</HI> It was a long Run, but
as we were to the <HI>North</HI> of the Islands, we had
the more Sea-room; so we steer'd <HI>East</HI> half a
<PB N="102" REF="105"/>
Point, one Way or other for the <HI>Manilla's,</HI> or
<HI>Phillipine</HI> Islands; which was the true Design
of our Voyage, and, perhaps, we were the first
Ship that ever came to those Islands freighted
from <HI>Europe</HI> since the <HI>Portuguese</HI> lost their Foot∣ing
there.</P>
<P>We put in on the <HI>North</HI> Coast <HI>of Borneo</HI> for
fresh Water, and were civilly enough used by
the Inhabitants of the Place, who brought us
Roots, and Fruits of several Kinds, and some
Goats, which we were glad of: We paid them
in Trifles; such as Knives, Cissars, Toys, and
several Sorts of wro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght Iron, Hatchets, Ham∣mers,
Glass-work, Looking-glasses, Drinking-glasses,
and the like. From hence we went a∣way,
as I say, for the <HI>Phillipine</HI> Islands. We saw
several Islands in our Way, but made no stop ex∣cept
once for Water, and arriv'd at <HI>Manilla</HI> the
twenty second of <HI>May,</HI> all our Vessels in very good
Condition, our Men healthy, and our Ships
sound; having met with very few contrary Winds,
and not one Storm in the whole Voyage from
<HI>Madagasear,</HI> having been seventeen Months and
two Days on the Voyage from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When we came hither, we saluted the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Flag, and came to an Anchor, carrying <HI>French</HI>
Colours: Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> who now acted as
Commander, sends his Boat on Shore the next
Day to the Governor with a Letter in <HI>French</HI> very
respectful; and telling the Governor, that hav∣ing
the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Commission, and being
come into those Seas, he hop'd, that for the
Friendship which was between their Most Christi∣an
and Catholick Majesties, he should be allow'd
the Freedom of Commerce, and the Use of the
Port; the like having been granted to his Most
<PB N="103" REF="106"/>
Christian Majesty's Subjects in all the Ports of
<HI>New Spain,</HI> as well in the <HI>Southern</HI> as in the <HI>Nor∣thern
Seas.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> Governor returned a very civil
and obliging Answer, and immediately granted
us to buy what Provisions we pleased for our
Supply, or any Thing else for our Use; but an∣swered,
that as for allowing any Exchange of
Merchandizes, or giving Leave for <HI>European</HI>
Goods to be brought on Shore there, that he was
not empower'd to grant.</P>
<P>We made as if this Answer was satisfactory e∣nough
to us; and the next Morning, Captain
<HI>Merlotte</HI> sent his Boat on Shore with all <HI>French</HI>
Sailors, and a Midship-man <HI>French,</HI> with a hand∣some
Present to the Governor; consisting of
some Bottles of <HI>French</HI> Wine, some Brandy, two
Pieces of Fine Holland, two Pieces of <HI>English</HI>
black Bays, one Piece of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine <HI>French</HI> Drugget,
and five Yards of Scarlet Woollen Cloth.</P>
<P>This was two considerable a Present for a <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>
to refuse; and yet these were all <HI>European</HI>
Goods, which he seem'd not to allow to come
on Shore. The Governor let the Captain know,
that he accepted his Present; and the Men who
brought it, were very handsomely entertained by
the Governor's Order, and had every one a
small Piece of Gold; and the Officer who went
at their Head, had five Pieces of Gold given him:
What Coin it was I could not tell, but I think it
was a <HI>Japan</HI> Coin, and the Value something less
than a Pistole.</P>
<P>The next Day the Governor sent a Gentleman
with a large Boat, and in it a Present to our
Captain; containing two Cows, ten Sheep or
Goats rather, for they were between both; a vast
<PB N="104" REF="107"/>
Number of Fowls of several Sorts, and twelve
great Boxes of Sweetmeats and Conserves, which
were indeed very valuable; and invited the Cap∣tain
and any of his Attendants on Shore, offer∣ing
to send Hostages on Board for our safe re∣turn;
and concluding with his Word of Honour
for our Safety, and free going back to our
Ships.</P>
<P>The Captain received the Present with very
great Respect, and indeed it was a very noble
Present; for at the same Time a Boat was sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to both the other Ships with Provisions and
Sweetmeats, in Proportion to the Bigness of the
Vessels. Our Captain caused the Gentleman who
came with this Present, to have a fine Piece o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Crimson <HI>English</HI> Cloth given him sufficient to make
a Wastecoat and Breeches of their Fashion, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a very good Hat, two Pair of Silk Stockings
and two Pair of Gloves; and all his People had
a Piece of Drugget given them sufficient to make
them the like Suit of Clothes; the Persons who
went to the other Ship, and to the Brigantine
had Presents in Proportion.</P>
<P>This, in short, was neither more or less than
Trading and Bartering, tho' for the Grimac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of it, we were, in a Manner, deny'd. The next
Day the Captain went on Shore to visit the Go∣vernor,
and with him several of our Officers, and
the Captain of the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship, formerly
my second Mate, and the Captain of the Brigan∣tine.
I did not go my self for that Time, nor
the <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> because whatever might hap∣pen,
I would be reserv'd on Board; besides I
did not care to appear in this Part of the
Work.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="108"/>
The Captain went on Shore like a Captain,
attended with his two Trumpeters, and the Ship
firing eleven Guns at his going off. The Gover∣nor
received him like himself, with prodigious
State and Formality; sending five Gentlemen
and a Guard of Soldiers to receive them at their
Landing, and to conduct them to his Palace:
when they came there, they were entertained
with the utmost Profusion, and wonderful Magnifi∣cence,
after the <HI>Spanish</HI> Manner; and they all had
the Honour to dine with his Excellence, that is
to say, all the Officers: At the same Time the
Men were entertain'd very handsomely in ano∣ther
House, and had very good Cheer: But it
was observ'd, that they had very little Wine,
except such as we had sent them; which the Go∣vernor
excused; his Store, which he had yearly
from <HI>New Spain,</HI> being spent; which Deficiency
we supply'd the next Day, and sent him a
Quarter Cask of very good <HI>Canary,</HI> and a half
Hogshed of <HI>Madera;</HI> which was a Present so
acceptable, that in short, after this, we might
do just as we pleased with him, and all his
Men.</P>
<P>While they were thus conversing together, af∣ter
Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner, Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> was made to under∣stand,
that tho' the Governer could not admit
an open avow'd Trade, yet that the Merchants
would not be forbid coming on Board our Ship,
and Trading with us in such Manner as we
should be very well satisfied with; after which,
we should be at no Hazard of getting the
Goods we should sell, put on Shore; and we
had an Experiment of this made in a few Days
as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="109"/>
When Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> took his leave of the
Governour, he invited his Excellence to come or
board our Ship, with such of his Attendants as he
pleas'd to bring with him, and in like manner of∣fered
Hostages for his Return; the Governour
accepted the Invitation, and with the same Ge∣nerosity
said, he would take his Parole of Ho∣nour
given, as he was the King of <HI>France's</HI> Cap∣tain,
and in the Name of his most Christian Ma∣jesty,
and would come on board.</P>
<P>The Governour did not come to the Shore side
with them, but stood in the Window of the Pa∣lace,
and gave them his Hat and Leg at their go∣ing
into their Boats, and made a Signal to the
Platform, to fire eleven Guns at their Boats put∣ing
off.</P>
<P>These were unusual and unexpected Honours
to us, who, but for this Stratagem of the <HI>French
Commission,</HI> had been declared Enemies: It was
suggested to me here, that I might with great
Ease surprize the whole Island, nay all the Islands,
the Governour putting such Confidence in us, that
we might go on shore in the very Fort unsuspect∣ed:
But tho' this was true, and that we did play
them a Trick at the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> I could not bear
the Thoughts of it here; besides I had quite ano∣ther
Game to play, which also was more advan∣tage
to us and to our Voyage, than an Enterprise
of so much Treachery could be to <HI>England,</HI> which
also, we might not be able to support from <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> might beat us out again
from <HI>Acapulco,</HI> and then we might pass our Time
ill enough.</P>
<P>Upon the whole I resolv'd to keep every Punc∣tilio
with the Governour very justly, and we
found our Account in it presently.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="110"/>
About three days afterwards we had Notice,
that the Governour would make us a Visit, and
we prepared to entertain his Excellence with as
much State as possible by the way we had pri∣vate
Notice, that the Governour would bring
with him some Merchants, who perhaps might
lay out some Money, and buy some of our Cargo;
nor was it without a secret Intimation, that even
the Governour himself was concern'd in the Mar∣ket
that should be made.</P>
<P>Upon this Intelligence, our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> caus∣ed
several Bales of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Goods to be
brought up and open'd, and lay'd so in the Steer∣age
and upon the Quarter Deck of the Ship, that
the Governour and his Atttendants should see
them of course as they pass'd by.</P>
<P>When the Boats came off from the shore,
which we knew by their Fort firing eleven Guns as
before, our Shipappear'd as fine as we could make
her, having the <HI>French</HI> Flag at the main Top as
Admiral, and Streamers and Penants at the Yard
Arms, waste Cloths out, and a very fine Awning
over the Quarter Deck. When his Excellency en∣tered
the Ship, we fir'd one and twenty Guns,
the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship fir'd the like Number, and
the Brigantine fifteen, having loaded her Guns
nimbly enough to fire twice.</P>
<P>As the Governour's Entertainment to us, was
more Meat than Liquor, so we gave him more
Liquor than Meat; for as we had several Sorts of
very good Wines on board, we spar'd nothing to
let him see, he was very welcome. After Dinner
we brought a large Bowl of Punch upon the Ta∣ble,
which was a Liquor he did not understand at
all: However to do him justice, he drank very mo∣derately,
and so did most of those that were with
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
him. As to the Men that belong'd to his Retinue,
I mean Servants and Attendants and the Crews
of the Boats, we made some of them drunk
enough.</P>
<P>While this was doing, we fonnd two Gentle∣men
of the Governour's Company, took Occasion
to leave the rest and walk about the Ship,
and in doing this, they seem'd as it were by
chance to cast their Eyes, upon our Bales of
Cloth and Stuffs, Bays, Linnen, Silks, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> and our
<HI>Supra Cargo</HI> and they began to make Bargains
apace, for he found they had not onely Money
enough, but had abundance of other Things,
which we were as willing to take as Money, and
of which they had brought Specimens with them;
as particularly Spices, such as Cloves and Nut∣megs,
<HI>China</HI> Ware, Tea, Japan'd Ware, wrought
Silks, raw Silk, and the like.</P>
<P>However our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> dealt with them at
present for Nothing but ready Money, and they
paid all in Gold; the Price he made here, was to
us indeed extravagant, tho' to them moderate,
seeing they had been us'd to buy these Goods
from the <HI>Acapulco</HI> Ships, which came in yearly,
from whom, to be sure, they bought dear enough.
They bought as many Goods at this Time, as they
paid the Value of fifteen thousand Peices of
Eight for, but all in Gold by Weight.</P>
<P>As for carrying them on Shore, the Governour
being with them, no Officer had any Thing to say
to them; it seems, they were carryed on Shore as
Presents, made by us to the Governour and his
Retinue.</P>
<P>The next Day three <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchants came
on board us, early in the Morning before it was
Light, and desir'd to see the <HI>Supra Cargo;</HI> they
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
brought with them a Box of Diamonds and some
Pearl, and a great Quantity of Gold, and to work
they went with our Cargo, and I thought once,
they would have bought the whole Ship's Loading;
but they contented themselves to buy about the
Value of two and twenty thousand Peices of
Eight, which, I suppose, might cost in <HI>England,</HI>
one sixth Part of the Money, or hardly so much.
We had some Difficulty about the Diamonds, be∣cause
we did not understand them very much, but
our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> ventur'd upon them at eight
thousand Peices of Eight, and took the rest in
Gold: They desir'd to stay on Board till the next
Night, when, soon after it was dark, a small
Sloop came on Board, and took in all their
Goods, and as we were told, carryed them away
to some other Island.</P>
<P>The same Day and before these Merchants
were gone, came a large Shallop on Board with a
square Sail, towing after her a great heavy Boat,
which had a Deck, but seem'd to have been a
large Ship's long Boat, built into a Kind of
Yatch, but ill masted, and sail'd heavily. In these
two Boats they brought seven Tun of Cloves in
Matts, some Chests of <HI>China</HI> Ware, some Pieces
of <HI>China</HI> Silks, of several Sorts, and a great
Sum of Money also.</P>
<P>In short, they sold so cheap and bought so dear,
that our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> declar'd, he would sell the
whole Cargo for Goods, if they would bring
them, for by his Calculation, he had dispos'd of
as many Goods, as he receiv'd the Value of one
hundred thousand Peices of Eight for, all which,
by his Accounts did not amount to, first Cost, a∣bove
three thousand Pounds Sterling in <HI>England,</HI>
Our Ship was now an open Fair, for two or three
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
Days after came the Vessel back, which went away
in the Night, and with them a <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonque, and
seven or eight <HI>Chineses</HI> or <HI>Japanners;</HI> strange, ugly,
ill looking Fellows they were, but brought a <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>
to be their Interpreter, and they came to
Trade also, bringing with them seventy great
Chests of <HI>China</HI> Ware, exceeding fine, twelve
Chests of <HI>China</HI> Silks of several Sorts, and some
laquer'd Cabinets very fine. We dealt with them
for all those, for our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> swept all clean,
and took every thing they brought. But they
were more difficult in the Goods, for as for Bayes,
and Druggets, and such Goods, they would not
meddle with them; but our fine Cloths and some
Bales of Linnen they bought very freely. So
we unloaded their Vessel, and put our Goods on
Board; we took a good Sum of Money of them
besides, but whither they went we knew not,
for they both came and went in the Night too,
as the other did.</P>
<P>This Trade held a good while, and we found,
that our Customers came more from other
Islands, than from the Island where the Governour
resided, the Reason of which, as we understood
afterwards, was, because as the Governour had
not openly granted a Freedom of Commerce, but
privately wink'd at it, so they were not wil∣ling
to carry it on openly before his Face, or <HI>as
we say,</HI> under his Nose, whereas in other Islands,
they could convey their Goods on Shore with
very little Hazard, agreeing with the Custom∣house
Officer for a finall Matter.</P>
<P>These Boats came and went thus several Times,
till in short we had dispos'd almost of the whole
Cargo; and now our Men began to be convinc'd,
that we had lay'd out our Uoyage very right, for
<PB N="111" REF="114"/>
never was Cargo better sold; and as we resolv'd
to pursue our Voyage for new <HI>Spain,</HI> we had ta∣ken
in a Cargo very proper to sell there, and so
perhaps to double the Advantage we had already
made.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, all our Hands were at Work
to store our selves anew, with such Provisions, as
could be had here for so long a Run, as we knew
we were to have next; namely, over the vast <HI>Pa∣cifick</HI>
Ocean or <HI>South Sea,</HI> a Voyage where we
might expect to see no Land for four Months, ex∣cept
we touch'd at the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> as it might hap∣pen;
and our greatest Anxiety was for Want of
Water, wihch our whole Ship could scarce be a∣ble
to stow sufficient for our Use, and if they
could, our Want of Casks was still as bad as the
Want of Water, for we really knew not what
to put Water in when we had it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had help'd us to some Casks but
not many, those that they could spare were but
small, and at last we were oblig'd to make use of
about two hundred large earthen Jars, which were
of singular Use to us. We got a large Quantity of
good Rice here, which we bought of a <HI>Chinese</HI> Mer∣chant,
who came in here with a large <HI>China</HI> Ves∣sel
to trade, and who bought of us also several of
our <HI>European</HI> Goods.</P>
<P>Just as we were ready to sail, a Boat came
from the Town of <HI>Manilla,</HI> and brought a new
Merchant, who wanted more <HI>English</HI> Goods, but
we had but few left; he brought with him thirty
Chests of Callicoes, Muslins, wrought Silks, some
of them admirably fine indeed, with fifteen Bales
of Romals, and twelve Tun of Nutmegs. We
sold them what Goods we had left, and gave
them Money for the rest, but had them at a
<PB N="112" REF="115"/>
Price so cheap, as was sufficient to let us know,
that it was always well worth while, for Ships to
trade from <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>East Indias;</HI> from
whence they are sure to make five or six of one.
Had more of these Merchants come on Board, we
were resolv'd to have lay'd out all the Gold and
Silver we had on Board, which, I assure you, was
a very considerable Quantity.</P>
<P>The last Merchant, who came on Board us,
was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but I found, that he spoke very
good <HI>French,</HI> and some <HI>English,</HI> that he had been
in <HI>England</HI> some Years ago, and understood <HI>English</HI>
Woolen Manufactures very well; he told me, they
had these Goods all from <HI>Acapulco,</HI> but that they
were then excessive dear, he had considerable
Dealings with the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and some with the
Coast of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> and <HI>Bengale,</HI> and kept a Ves∣sel
or two of his own to go to <HI>Bengal,</HI> which ge∣nerally
went twice in a Year.</P>
<P>I found, he had great Business with new <HI>Spain,</HI>
and that he generally had one of the <HI>Acapulco</HI>
Ships chiefly consign'd to him; so that he was full
of all such Goods, as those Ships generally carry∣ed
away from the <HI>Manilla's,</HI> and had we traded
with him sooner, we had had more Callicoes and
Muslins, than we now had: However we were
exceedingly well stor'd with Goods of all Sorts,
suitable for a Market in <HI>Peru,</HI> whither I resolv'd
to go.</P>
<P>We continued chaffering after this Manner a∣bout
nine Weeks, during which Time, we car∣reen'd
our Ships, clean'd their Bottoms, rummag'd
our Gold, and repack'd some of our Provisions;
endeavouring as much as possible, to keep all our
Men as fully employ'd as we could, to preserve
<PB N="113" REF="116"/>
them in Health, and yet not to over work them,
considering the Heat of the Climate.</P>
<P>Some Time before we were ready to sail, I
call'd all the Warrant Officers together, and told
them, that as we were come to a Country, where
Abundance of small Things were to be bought,
and going to a Country, where we might possibly
have Room to sell them again to Advantage, I
would advance to every Officer an hundred Dollars,
upon Account of their Pay, that they might lay it
out to their Advantage here, and dispose it again
on the Coast of <HI>New Spain,</HI> this was very accepta∣ble
to them, and they acknowledg'd it; and here,
besides this, by the Consent of all our Superior Offi∣cers,
I gave a Largess or Bounty of five Dollars a
Man, to all our Fore-Mast Men; most of which, I
believe, they lay'd out in Arrack and Sugar, to
chear them up in the rest of the Voyage, which
they all knew would be long enough.</P>
<P>We went away from <HI>Marcilla</HI> in the Island of
<HI>Luzon</HI> or <HI>Luconia</HI> the fifteenth of the Month of
<HI>August,</HI> and in the Year 1714<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and sailing a while
to the <HI>Southward,</HI> pass'd the Straits between that
Island, and <HI>Mindanoa,</HI> another of the <HI>Phillipines,</HI>
where we met with little extraordinary, except
extraordinary Lightning and Thunders, such as we
never heard or saw before, tho' it seems, 'tis very
familiar in that Climate; till about sixteen Days
sailing, we saw the Isle of <HI>Guam,</HI> one of the <HI>La∣drones,</HI>
or Isle of <HI>Thieves,</HI> for so much the Word im∣ports;
here we came to an Anchor <HI>Sept.</HI> 3. under the
Lee of a steep Shore, on the <HI>North</HI> Side of the Isle
of <HI>Guam;</HI> but, as we wanted no Trade here, we
did not at first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after the chief Port, or
<HI>Spanish</HI> Governour, or any thing of that Kind <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but we chang'd our Situation the next Day, and
<PB N="114" REF="117"/>
went thro' the Passage, to the <HI>East</HI> Side of the
Island, and came to an Anchor off of the Town.</P>
<P>The People came off, and brought us Hogs,
and Fowls, and several Sorts of Roots, and
Greens, Things, which we were very glad of,
and which we bought the more of, because we al∣ways
found, that such Things were good to keep
the Men from the Scurvy, and even to cure them
of it, if they had it; we took in fresh Water here
also, tho' it was with some Difficulty, the Water
lying half a Mile from the Shore.</P>
<P>When I parted from <HI>Manilla,</HI> and was geting
thro' the Strait between the Island <HI>Lucon,</HI> and
that of <HI>Mindanoa,</HI> I had some Thoughts of steering
away <HI>North,</HI> to try, what Land we might meet
with to the <HI>North East</HI> of the <HI>Phillipines;</HI> and with
Intent to have endeavour'd to make up into
the Latitude of fifty or sixty Degrees, and have
come about again to the <HI>South,</HI> between the Island
of <HI>California,</HI> and the main Land of <HI>America;</HI> in
which Course, I did not question, meeting with
extraordinary new Discoveries, and perhaps such
as the Age might not expect to hear of, relat∣ing
to the <HI>Northern</HI> World, and the Possibility of
a Passage out of those Seas, either <HI>East or West,</HI> both
which, I doubt not, would be found, if they were
search'd after this Way; and which, for ought
I know, remain undiscovered for want only of an
Attempt being made by those Seas, where it
would be easy to find, whether the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Seas
are navigable or not? And whether <HI>Nova Zembla</HI>
be an Island, or joyn'd to the Main? Whether the
Inlets of <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> have any opening into the
<HI>West</HI> Sea, and whether the vast Lakes, from whence
the great River of <HI>Canada</HI> is said to flow, have
any Communication this Way, or not.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="118"/>
But tho' these were valuable Discoveries, yet
when I began to cast up the Account in a more
serious Manner, they appear'd to have no Rela∣tion
to, or Coherence with our intended Voy∣age
or with the Design of our Employers,
which we were to consider in the first Place; for
tho' it is true that we were encourag'd to make all
such Kinds of useful Discoveries, as might tend to
the Advantage of Trade, and the Improvement
of Geographical Knowledge and Experience; yet
it was all to be so directed, as to be subservient to
the Profits and Advantages of a trading and cruis∣ing
Voyage.</P>
<P>It is true, that these <HI>Northern</HI> Discoveries
might be inimitably fine, and most glorious
Things to the <HI>British</HI> Nation, and infinitely for
the future Advantage of Commerce in general:
yet, as I have said, it was evident, that they
tended directly to destroy the Voyage, either as
to trading, or to cruising, and might perhaps end
in our own Destruction also; for Example; first
of all, if adventuring into those <HI>Northern</HI> Seas,
we should, by our Industry, make out the Disco∣very,
and find a Passage, either <HI>East</HI> or <HI>West;</HI> we
must follow the Discovery so, as to venture quite
thro', or else we could not be sure, that it was
really a Discovery; for these Passages would not
be like doubling Cape <HI>de Bon Esperance,</HI> on the Point
of <HI>Africa;</HI> or going round Cape <HI>Horn,</HI> the <HI>Southermost</HI>
Point of <HI>America,</HI> either of which were compass'd
in a few Days, and then immediately gave an open∣ing
into the <HI>Indian</HI> or <HI>Southern</HI> Oceans, where good
Weather and certain Refreshment were to be had.</P>
<P>Whereas, for the Discovery in the <HI>North,</HI>
after having pass'd the <HI>Northermost</HI> Land of <HI>Grand
Tartary,</HI> in the Latitude of seventy four, even to
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
eighty Degrees, and perhaps to the very <HI>North</HI>
Pole: there must be a Run <HI>West,</HI> beyond the most
<HI>Northerly</HI> Point of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> and on again <HI>W.
S. W.</HI> about the <HI>North</HI> Kyn and <HI>North</HI> Cape above
six hundred Leagues, before we could come to
have any Relief of the Climate after that, one
hundred and sixty Leagues more, and even to <HI>Shet∣land</HI>
and the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> before we could
meet with any Relief of Provisions, which, after
the Length we must have run, from the Latitude
of three Degrees and an half, where we now were
at the <HI>Phillipine,</HI> Islands, to seventy four, Degrees
<HI>North</HI> being near five thousand Miles, would be im∣possible
to be done; unless we were sure to victual,
and furnish our selves again, with Provisions and
Water by the Way, and that in several Places.</P>
<P>As to the other Passage <HI>East,</HI> towards the Con∣tinent
of <HI>America,</HI> we had this uncertainty also;
namely, that it was not yet discover'd, whether
the Land of <HI>California</HI> was an Island, or a Conti∣nent,
and if it should prove the latter, so as
that we should be oblig'd to come back to the
<HI>West,</HI> and not be able to find an Opening, be∣tween
<HI>California</HI> and the Land of <HI>North America,</HI>
so as to come away to the Coast of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to
<HI>Acapulco,</HI> and so into the <HI>South Sea,</HI> and at the
same Time should not find a Passage thro' <HI>Hud∣son's
Bay, &amp;c.</HI> into the <HI>North Sea,</HI> and so to <HI>Eu∣rope:</HI>
we should not only spoil the Voyage that
Way also, but should infallibly perish by the Se∣verity
of the Season, and want of Provisions.</P>
<P>All these Things argued against any Attempt
that Way; whereas on the other Hand, for <HI>South∣ern</HI>
Discoveries we had this particular Encourage∣ment;
that what ever Disappointment we might
meet with, in the Search after unknown Coun∣tries,
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>
yet we were sure of an open Sea behind
us; and that when ever we thought fit, to run
<HI>South</HI> beyond the <HI>Tropick,</HI> we should find innume∣rable
Islands, where we might get Water, and
some Sort of Provisions, or come back into a favou∣rable
Climate, and have the Benefit of the Trade
Winds, to carry us either backward or forward,
as the Season should happen to guide us.</P>
<P>Last of all, we had this Assurance, that, the
Dangers of the Seas excepted, we were sure of an
Outlet, before us, if we went forward, or be∣hind
us, if we were forc'd back, and having a
rich Cargo, if we were to do nothing but go
home, we should be able to give our Employers
such an Account of our selves, as that they
would be very far from being Losers by the Voyage;
but that if we reach'd safe to the Coast of <HI>New
Spain,</HI> and met with an open Commerce there, as
we expected, we should perhaps make the most
prosperous Voyage, that was ever made round
the Globe before.</P>
<P>These Considerations put an End to all my
Thoughts of going <HI>Northward;</HI> some of our secret
Council, <HI>for by the way, we consulted our Foremast
Men no more, but had a</HI> secret Council <HI>among our
selves, the Resolutions of which we solemnly engag'd
not to disclose:</HI> Some of these, I say, were for
steering the usual Course, from the <HI>Phillipines</HI> to
<HI>New Spain, viz.</HI> keeping in the Latitudes of ele∣ven
or thirteen Degrees, <HI>North</HI> of the Line, and so
making directly for <HI>California;</HI> in which Latitude
they propos'd, that we might perhaps, by cruising
there about, meet with the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ships, going
from <HI>New Spain</HI> to <HI>Manilla,</HI> which we might take
as a Prize, and then stand directly for the Coast of
<HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="121"/>
But I oppos'd this; principally, because it
would effectually overthrow all my meditated
Discoveries to the <HI>Southward;</HI> and secondly, be∣cause
I had observ'd, that on the <HI>North</HI> of the
Line, there are no Islands to be met with, in all
the long Run, of near two thousand Leagues, from
<HI>Guam</HI> one of the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> to the Land of <HI>Cali∣fornia;</HI>
and that we did not find, we were able to
subsist during so long a Run, especially for Want
of Water; whereas on the <HI>South</HI> of the Line, as
well within the <HI>Tropick</HI> as without, we were sure
to meet with Islands <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnumerable, and that even
all the Way, so that we were sure of frequent
Relief of fresh Water, of Plants, Fowl, and Fish,
if not of Bread and Flesh, almost all the Way.</P>
<P>This was a main Consideration to our Men,
and so we soon resolv'd to take the <HI>Southern</HI> Course;
yet, as I said, we stood away for the <HI>Ladrones</HI> first;
these are a Cluster of Islands, which lie in about
eleven to thirteen Degrees <HI>North</HI> Latitude,
<HI>North East</HI> from the <HI>Moluccoes,</HI> or Spice Islands,
and E. and by N. from that Part of the <HI>Phil∣lipines</HI>
where we were, and at the Distance of
about four hundred Leagues, and all the Ships,
which go or come between the <HI>Phillipines</HI> and
<HI>New Spain,</HI> touch at them, for the Convenience
of Provisions, Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> those, that go to <HI>Spain,</HI>
put in there, in Order to recruit and furnish <HI>for,</HI>
and those that come from <HI>Spain,</HI> to relieve them∣selves
<HI>after</HI> so long a Run as that of six thousand
Miles, for so much it is at least from <HI>Guam</HI> to
<HI>Acapulco;</HI> on these Accounts, and with these Rea∣sonings,
we came to the Isles of the <HI>Ladrones.</HI></P>
<P>During our Run between the <HI>Phillipine</HI> and <HI>La∣drone</HI>
Islands, we liv'd wholly upon our fresh Pro∣visions,
of which we laid in a great Stock at <HI>Ma∣nilla,</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>
such as Hogs, Fowls, Calves, and six or
seven Cows, all alive, so that our <HI>English</HI> Beef and
Pork, which lay well stor'd, was not touch'd for
a long Time.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Ladrones</HI> we recruited, and particularly
took on Board, as well alive as pickl'd up, near
two hundred Hogs, with a vast Store of Roots,
and such Things as are their usual Food in that
Country; we took in also above three thousand
cocoa Nuts and Cabbages; Yams, Potatoes and
other Roots for our own Use, and in particular
we got a large Quantity of Maiz, or <HI>Indian</HI>
Wheat for Bread, and some Rice.</P>
<P>We stor'd our selves likewise with Oranges
and Lemons, and buying a great Quantity of very
good Limes, we made three or four Hogsheads of
Limejuice; which was a great Relief to our Men
in the hot Season, to mix with their Water; as
for making Punch, we had some Arrack and some
Sugar, but neither of them in any Quantity, so
as to have much Punch made afore the Mast.</P>
<P>We were eighteen Days on our Passage from
the Streight of <HI>Mindanoa</HI> to <HI>Guam,</HI> and stay'd
six Days at <HI>Guam,</HI> furnishing our selves with Pro∣visions,
appearing all this while with <HI>French</HI> Co∣lours,
and Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> as Commander:
However, we made no great Ceremony here
with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governor, as I have said already,
only that Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> after we had been
here two Days, sent a Letter to him by a <HI>French</HI>
Officer, who showing his Commission from the
King of <HI>France;</HI> the Governor presently gave us
Product, as we call it, and Leave to buy what
Provisions we wanted: In Compliment for this
Civility, we sent the Governor a small Present
of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine Scarlet Cambler, and two Pieces of Bays;
<PB N="120" REF="123"/>
and he made a very handsome Return, in such
Refreshments as he thought we most wanted.</P>
<P>There was another Reason for our keeping in
this Latitude till we came to the <HI>Ladrones:</HI>
namely, that all the <HI>Southern</HI> Side of that Part
of the Way between the <HI>Phillipines</HI> and the <HI>La∣drones,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so full of Islands, that unless we had
had very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pilots, it would have been very
hazardous; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to this, that beyond these
Islands <HI>South</HI> is no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Land, which they
call <HI>Nova Guinea,</HI> lying away <HI>East</HI> and E. S. E.;
farther than has yet been discover'd; so that it
is not yet known, whether that Country be an
Island or the Continent.</P>
<P>Having for all these Reasons gone to the <HI>La∣drones,</HI>
and being sufficiently satisfied in our Rea∣sons,
for going away from thence to the <HI>Southward,</HI>
and having stor'd our selves as above, with where∣ver
those Islands produc'd, we left the <HI>Ladrones,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> of <HI>September</HI> in the Evening,
and stood away E. S. E. with the Wind N. N. W.
a fresh <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after this, I think, it was about
five Days, when having stretch'd by our Account
about an hundred and fifty Leagues, we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
away more to the <HI>Southward,</HI> our Course S E. by S.</P>
<P>And now, if ever, I expected to do something
by Way of Discovery; I knew very well there
were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew, if any, had ever steer'd that Course; or
that if they had, they had given very little Ac∣count
of their Travels. The only Person who
leaves any Thing worth Notice; being <HI>Cornelius
Vans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>houton</HI> and <HI>Francis La Mare,</HI> who, tho'
they sail'd very much <HI>South,</HI> yet say little to the
Purpose, as I shall shew presently.</P>
<P>The sixteenth Day after we parted from the
<HI>Ladrones,</HI> being, by Observation, in the Latitude
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>
of seventeen Degrees <HI>South</HI> of the Line, one of
our Men cried a Sail, a Sail, which put us into
some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of Wonder, knowing, nothing of a
Ship of any Bulk could be met with in those Seas;
but our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of Wonder was soon turn'd to a fit of
Laughter, when one of our Men from the Fore∣top,
cried out <HI>Land,</HI> which indeed was the Case;
and the first Sailor was sufficiently laugh'd at
for his Mistake, tho', give him his due, it look'd
at first as like a Sail, as ever any Land at a Di∣stance
could look.</P>
<P>Towards Evening, we made the Land very
plain, Distance about seven Leagues <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> and
found that it was not an Island, but a vast Tract
of Land, extended, as we had Reason to be∣lieve,
from the Side of <HI>Gillolo,</HI> and the Spice
Islands, or that which we call <HI>Nova Guinea,</HI> and
never yet fully discovered. The Land lying a∣way
from the <HI>West N. W.</HI> to the <HI>S. E.</HI> by <HI>South.</HI>
still <HI>Southerly.</HI></P>
<P>I that was for making all possible Discovery, was
willing, besides the Convenience of Water, and
perhaps fresh Provisions, to put in her, and see
what kind of a Country it was: So I ordred the
Brigantine to stand in for the Shore: They sound∣ed,
but found no Ground within half a League
of the Shore; so they hoysted out their Boat and
went close in with the Shore, where they found
good Anchor hold in about thirty six Fathom,
and a large Creek, or Mouth of a River;
here they found eleven to thirteen Fathom soft
ouzy Sand, and the Water half fresh at the
Mouth of the Creek.</P>
<P>Upon Notice of this, we stood in, and came
all to an Anchor in the very Creek; and sending
our Boats up the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reek, found the Water per∣fect
<PB N="122" REF="125"/>
fresh and very good upon the Ebb, about a
League up the River.</P>
<P>Among all the Islands in this Part of the
World, that is to say, from the <HI>Phillipines Eastward,</HI>
of which there are an infinite Number, We ne∣ver
came near any, but we found our selves sur∣rounded
with Canoes and Variety of Boats,
bringing off to us <HI>Cocoa Nutts,</HI> Plantanes, Roots
and Greens, to traffick for such Things as they
could get; and that in such Numbers as we were
tired with them, and sometimes allarm'd, and
oblig'd to fire at them. But here, tho' we saw
great Numbers of People at a Distance from
the Shore, yet we saw not one Boat or Bark,
nor any Thing else upon the Water.</P>
<P>We stay'd two or three Days taking in fresh
Water, but it was impossible to restrain our
Men from going on Shore, to see what Sort of
a Country it was; and I was very willing they
should do so: Accordingly, two of our Boats,
with about thirty Men in both of them, went
on Shore on the <HI>East</HI> Side of the Creek or Har∣bour,
where our Ship lay.</P>
<P>They found the Country look'd wild and sa∣vage
enough, but tho' they could find no Houses
or speak with the Inhabitants, they saw
their Footsteps and their Seats where they had
sat down under some Trees; and after wandring
about a little, they saw People, both Men and
Women at a Distance; but they run away from
our Men, at first Sight, like frighted Deer; nor
could they make any Signal to them to be under∣stood;
for when our Men hallood, and call'd af∣ter
them, they run again as if they had been
bewitch'd.</P>
<P>Our Men gather'd a great Variety of green
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
Stuff, tho' they knew not of what Kind, and
brought it all on Board, and we eat a great
deal of it; some we boyl'd and made Broth of;
and some of our Men, who had the Scurvy,
found it did them a great deal of Good; for the
Herbs eat all spicey, and had a most pleasant
agreeable Taste; but none of us could tell what
to call them, tho' we had several Men on Board
who had been among the Spice Islands before in
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ships.</P>
<P>We were very uneasy that we could get no∣thing
here but a little Grass and Pot-herbs, as
our Men call'd it, and the Men mov'd me to let
them have two Boats, and go up the River as
high as the Tide would carry them: This I con∣sented
to, being as willing to make the Disco∣very
as they: So I ordered the Captain of the
<HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship, who had, as I have said, been
formerly my second Mate; I say, I order'd him
to go along with them.</P>
<P>But in the Morning, a little before the Flood
was made, I was call'd out of my Cabbin to see
an Army, as they told me, coming to attack
us: I turn'd out hastily enough, you may be
sure, and such an Army no Ship were ever at∣tack'd
with; for we spy'd three or four hundred
black Creatures, come playing and tumbling
down the Stream, towards us, like so many Por∣poises
in the Water: I was not satisfied at first that
they were humane Creatures; but would have
persuaded our Men, that they were Sea-monsters;
and that they were certainly Fishes of some
strange Kind.</P>
<P>But they quickly undeceiv'd us, for they came
swimming about our Ships, staring and won∣dring,
and calling to one another but said not
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>
one Word to us; at least, if they did, we could
not understand it.</P>
<P>Some of them came very near our Ship, and
we made Signs to them to come on Board but
they would not veuture: We toss'd one of them
a Rope, and he took hold of it boldly; but as
soon as we offer'd to pull, he let go, and
laugh'd at us; another of them did the
like, and when he let go, turn'd up his black
Buttocks, as in Sport at us; the Language of
which, in our Country, we all knew, but whe∣ther
they meant it so or not, that we cannot
tell.</P>
<P>However, this dumb conversing with them,
we did not like, neither was it to any Purpose
to us; and I was resolv'd, if possible, to know
something more of them than we could get
thus: So I ordered out our Pinnace with six Oars,
and as many other Men, well arm'd, to row a∣mong
them; and, if possible, to take some of
them and bring them on Board. They went
off, but the six Oar Pinnace, tho' a very nimble
Boat, could not row so fast as they could swim;
for if pulling with all their might, they came near
one of them, immediately, like Dog and Duck,
they would dive and come up again thirty or
forty Yards off; so that our Men did not know
which Way to row after them: However, at
last, getting among the thickest of them, they
got hold of two, and, with some Difficulty,
drag'd them in; but were surpriz'd to find they
were both Women: However, they brought
them on Board naked as they were. When
they came on Board, I ordred they should have
two Pieces of Linnen wrapt round their Was<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es
to cover them, which they seem'd extraordina∣ry
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>
glad of: We gave them also several Strings of
Beads, and our Men tyed them about their
Necks, and about their Arms like Bracelets, and
they were wonderfully pleas'd with that. O∣thers
of our Men gave them each of them a Pair
of Scissars, with Needles, and some Thread and
threading the Needles, show'd them how to sow
with them: We gave them Food, and each of
them a Dram of Arak, and made Signs to know
of them where they liv'd; they pointed up to
the River, but we could by no Means understand
them. When we had dress'd them up thus with
Necklaces, and Bracelets, and Linnen, we
brought them up upon the Deck, and made them
call to their Country Folk, and let them see
how well they were used, and ask them to come
on Board, but they would not venture.</P>
<P>However, as I thought, the Discovery we
were to make, would be something the easier
on the Account of the Usage of these two
young Women; for they were not, as we guess,
above twenty or two and twenty Years of Age;
we resolved, that the Boat should go on, as we
intended up the River; and that, as these two
Women pointed that Way, they should carry
them along with them.</P>
<P>Accordingly we sent two Shallops or large
Boats, which carried together sixty Men all well
arm'd. We gave them Store of Beads and
Knives, and Scissars, and such Baubles with them,
with Hatchets and Nails, and Hooks, Looking-glasses,
and the like; and we built up the Sides
of the Boat and Stern, and cover'd them with
Boards to keep off Arrows and Darts, if they
shoud find Occasion; so that they look'd like <HI>London</HI>
Barges: In this Posture, as soon as the Tide of
<PB N="126" REF="129"/>
Flood was made up, our Men went away, carry∣ing
a Drum and a Trumpet in each Boat; and
each Boat had also two Pattereroes fix'd on the
Gunnel near the Bow.</P>
<P>Thus furnish'd, they went off about eleven
a Clock in the Forenoon, and to my very great
Uneasiness, I heard no more of them in four
Days; the whole Ship's Company were indeed
surpriz'd at their Stay, and the Captain of the
Sloop would fain have had me let him have sail'd
up the River with the Sloop as far as the Chan∣nel
would serve; which indeed we found was
deep enough. Indeed, as I was unwilling to
run any more Risques; I could not perswade
my self, but, that the Force I had already sent,
was sufficient to fight five thousand naked Crea∣tures,
such as the Natives seem'd to be; and
therefore I was very unwilling to send:
However, I consented, at last, to have our long
Boat and two smaller Boats mann'd with fifty
four Men more, very well arm'd and cover'd
from Arrows and Darts, as the other had been,
go up the River, upon their solemn Promise, and
with express Order, to return the next Day at
farthest; ordering them to fire Guns as they
went up the River to give Notice to their Fel∣lows,
if they could be heard that they were
coming; and that in the mean Time, if I fir'd
three Guns, they should immediately return.</P>
<P>They went away with the Tyde of Flood,
a little before Noon, and went up the River a∣bout
five Leagues; the Tide running but slowly
up, and a strong Fresh of Land-water that
check'd the Tide coming down; so that when
the Tide was spent, they came to an Anchor;
they found the River contrary to their Expec∣tation,
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
continued both deep enough, and was
wider in Breadth than where the Ships were at
Anchor; and that it had another Mouth or Out∣let
into the Sea some Leagues farther <HI>East</HI> so
that the Land to the <HI>East</HI> of us, where our Men
went on Shore, was but an Island, and had not
many Inhabitants, if any at all; the People they
had seen there, having, possibly, swam over the
other Arm or Branch of the River to observe
our Ships the nearer.</P>
<P>As our Men found they could go no farther
for want of the Tide, they resolv'd to come to
an Anchor; but just as they were sounding, to
see what Ground they had, and what Depth,
a small Breeze at <HI>N. E.</HI> sprung up; by which they
stem'd the Current, and reach'd up about two
Leagues farther, when they hove over their
Grapling in five Fathom Water, soft Ground;
so that all this Way, and much farther, all our
Ships might have gone up the Channel, being
as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> is about <HI>Fox-hall.</HI></P>
<P>It must be observ'd, that all along this River,
they found the Land, after they came past the
Place where the other Branch of the River broke
off, <HI>Eastward,</HI> was full of Inhabitants on both Sides,
who frequently come down to the Waters-side
to gaze and look at our Boats. But always,
when our Men call'd to them, as if they thought
our Men enquir'd after their Fellows, they poin∣ted
up the River; which was as much as to say,
they were gone farther that Way.</P>
<P>However, our Men being not able to go any
farther against the Tide, took no Notice of that;
but after a little while, some of them, in one of
the smaller Boats, row'd towards the Shore,
holding up a white Flag to the People, in Token
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>
of Peace: But it was all one, and would have been
been all one, for ought we know, if they had
held up a red Flag, for they run all away, Men,
Women and Children; nor could our Men by
any Persuasions, by Gestures and Signs of any
Kind, prevail on them to stay, or hardly so
much as to look at them.</P>
<P>The Night coming on, our Men knew not
well what Course to take; they saw several of
the <HI>Indians</HI> Dwellings and Habitations, but they
were all at a Distance from the River, occasion'd,
as our Men suppos'd, by the Rivers overflowing
the flat Grounds near its Banks, so as to render
those Lands not habitable.</P>
<P>Our Men had a great Mind to have gone up to
one of the Towns they saw, but he, that com∣manded,
would not permit it, but told them, that
if they could find a good landing Place, that they
might all go on Shore, except a few, to keep
the Boats, they would venture; upon which the
smallest Boat row'd up about a Mile, and found a
small River running into the greater, and here they
all resolv'd to land: but first they fir'd two
Muskets, to give Notice, if possible, to their Com∣rades,
that they were at Hand, however they
heard Nothing of them.</P>
<P>What Impression the Noise of the two Mus∣kets
made among the <HI>Indians,</HI> they could not tell,
for they were all run away before.</P>
<P>They were no sooner on Shore, but consider∣ing
they had not above two Hours Day; and that
the <HI>Indian</HI> Villages were at least two Miles off,
they call'd a Council, and resolv'd not to march
so far into a Country they knew so little of, and
be left to come back in the dark; so they went on
Board again and waited 'till Morning, however
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>
they view'd the Country, found it was a fer∣tile
Soil, and a great Herbage on the Ground:
There were few Trees near the River; but far∣ther
up, where the <HI>Indian</HI> Dwellings were, the
little Hills seem'd to be covered with Woods,
but of what Kind they knew not.</P>
<P>In the Morning before break of Day, some of
our Men fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cied they heard a Gun fir'd up the
River; upon which, the Officer ordered
two Musquets to be fir'd again, as had been
done the Evening before; in about a Quarter of
an Hour they were answer'd by the like Firing,
by which, our Men knew that their Comrades
heard them; so without pursuing their intended
Landing, the Tide being then running upwards,
they weigh'd, and set to their Oars, having lit∣tle
or no Wind, and that which was, blowing
down the Stream.</P>
<P>After they had gone about a League, they
heard a confused Noise at a great Distance, which
surprized them a little at first; but as they per∣ceiv'd
it drew nearer and nearer, they waited a
while, when they perceiv'd first here and there
some People, then more, and then about two or
three hundred Men and Women together, run∣ning,
and every one carrying something.</P>
<P>Whither it was they were going, or what it
was they carried, we could not tell till they came
nearer; when we found that they were all loaded
with Provisions, Cocoa Nuts, Roots, Cabbages,
and a great Variety of Things which we knew
little of; and all these were carrying down to
our Ships, as we understood afterwards, in Gra∣titude
for our good Usage of the two young
Women.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="133"/>
When these People saw our Men and their
three Boats, they were at a full Stop, and once
or twice they were ready to lay down all their
Loads and run for it; but ours made Signs of
Peace, and held up a white Flag to them.</P>
<P>Some of them, it seems, having, as we found,
convers'd with our Men, had a little more Cou∣rage
than the rest, and came to the Shore side,
and look'd at the Boats: One of our Men be∣thought
himself of a Stratagem to make known
to them our Desire of Peace with them; and
taking a String of Beads and some Toys, he held
them up at the End of the Boat Hook Staff,
and shew'd them to the <HI>Indians,</HI> pointing to them
with his Hand, and then pointing with the other
Hand, to what the <HI>Indians</HI> carry'd, and to his
Mouth, intimating, that we wanted such Things
to eat, and would give him the Beads for them.</P>
<P>One of the <HI>Indians</HI> presently understood him,
and throws himself into the Water, holding a
Bundle of Plants, such as he had truss'd up toge∣ther,
upon his Head, and swiming with the other
Hand, and comes so near the Boat, where our
Men held out the Staff, as to reach the End of
the Staff, take off the String of Beads and Toys,
and hang his Bunch of Trash, for it was no
better, upon the Hook, and go back again, but
would come no nearer.</P>
<P>When he was gotten on Shore again, all his
Comrades came about him, to see what he had
got; he hung the String of Beads about his Neck,
and run dancing about, with the other Things
in his Hand, as if he had been mad.</P>
<P>What our Men got, was a Trifle, of less
Worth, than a good Bunch of Carrots in <HI>England,</HI>
but yet it was useful, as it brought the People to
<PB N="131" REF="134"/>
converse with us; for after this, they brought us
Roots, and Fruits innumerable, and began to be
very well acquainted with us.</P>
<P>By that Time<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Men had chaffer'd thus, four
or five Times, they first heard, and in a little
while after, saw their two great Boats with their
Fellows, coming down the River, at about two
Miles distance, with their Drums and Trumpets,
and making Noise enough.</P>
<P>They had been, it seems, about three Leagues
higher up, where they had been on Shore among
the <HI>Indians,</HI> and had set at Liberty the two
Maidens, for such, they understood, they were;
who, letting their Friends see how fine they
were dress'd, and how well they were us'd, the
<HI>Indians</HI> were so exceedingly oblig'd, and shew'd
themselves so grateful, that they thought no∣thing
too much for them; but brought out all
the Sorts of Provisions, which their Country
produc'd, which, it seems, amounted to nothing,
but Fruits, such as Plantanes, Cocoa Nuts, O∣ranges
and Lemons, and such Things, and Roots,
which we could give no Name to; but, that
which was most for our Use, was a very good
Sort of <HI>Maiz,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, which made us
very good Bread.</P>
<P>They had, it seems, some Hogs, and some
Goats, but our Men got only six of the latter;
which were at hand, and were very good. But,
that which was most remarkable, was, that
whereas, in all the Islands within the <HI>Tropicks,</HI>
the People are thievish, treacherous, fierce, and
mischievous; and are arm'd with Lances, or
Darts, or Bows and Arrows: these appear'd to
be a peaceable, quiet, inoffensive People; nor
did our Men see any Weapon among them;
<PB N="132" REF="135"/>
except a long Staff, which most of the Men
carried in their Hands; being made of a Cane,
about eight foot long, and an Inch and half Dia∣meter,
much like a Quarter Staff; with which
they would leap over small Brooks of Water,
with admirable Dexterity.</P>
<P>The People were black, or rather of a tawny
dark brown; their Hair long, but curling in
very handsome Rings: They went generally quite
naked, both Men and Women; except that in
two Places, our Men said, they found some of
the Women cover'd, from the Middle down∣ward.
They seem'd to have no Conversation
with the Sea at all, nor did we see so much as
any one Boat among them; nor did any of the
Inhabitants dwell near the Sea; but cultivated
their Lands very well, in their Way; having
abundance of Greens and Fruits, growing about
their Houses; and upon which, we found, they
chiefly liv'd. The Climate seem'd to be very hot,
and yet the Country very fruitful.</P>
<P>These People, by all we could perceive, had
never had any converse, with the rest of the
World by Sea, what they might have by Land,
we know not; but as they lie quite out of the
Way of all Commerce, so it might be probable,
they never had seen a Ship, or Boat; whether
any <HI>European</HI> Ship, or so much as a Periagua of the
Islands. We have mention'd their nearest
Distance to the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> being at least four
hundred Leagues; and from the Spice Islands,
and the Country of new <HI>Guinea,</HI> much more;
but as to the <HI>European</HI> Shipping, I never heard of
any, that ever went that Way, neither do I
believe, any ever did.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136"/>
I take the more Notice of these People's not
having convers'd, as I say, with the World,
because of the Innocence of their Behaviour,
their peaceable Disposition, and their Way of
living upon the Fruits and Produce of the Earth;
also their Cultivation, and the Manner of their
Habitations; no Signs of Rapine or Violence
appearing among them. Our Stay here was so
little, that we could make no Enquiry into their
Religion, Manner of Government, and other
Customs: nor have I Room to crowd many of
these Things into this Account. They went
indeed naked, some of them stark naked, both
Men and Women; but I thought, they differ'd in
their Countenances, from all the wild People,
that I ever saw; that they had something singu∣larly
honest, and sincere in their Faces; nor did
we find any Thing of Falshood or Treachery
among them.</P>
<P>The Gratitude they exprest, for our kindly
using the two young Women I have mention'd,
was a Token of generous Principles; and our
Men told us, that they would have given them
what ever they could have ask'd, if they had
had it.</P>
<P>In a Word, it was on their Account, they sent
that little Army of People to us, loaden with
Provisions, which our Men met, before the two
Shallops came down. But all the Provisions they
had, consisted chiefly in Fruits of the Earth,
Cocoa Nuts, Plantanes, Oranges, Lemons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and <HI>Maiz,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn. We had not any
sufficient Time with them, to enquire after
what Traffick they had, or whether any Thing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it for us; that they had several fragrant Plants;
and I believe, some Spices, as particularly Cin∣namon;
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>
that we found, but what else the Coun∣try
produces, we know not.</P>
<P>We came away from hence, after seven Days
Stay, having observ'd little of the Country,
more than that it seem'd to be very pleasant,
but very hot; the Woods were all flourishing
and green; and the Soil rich, but no great
Matter, that could be the Subject of Trade: But
an excellent Place, to be a Bait Land, or Port
of Refreshment in any Voyage, that might after∣wards
be undertaken that Way.</P>
<P>Weset Sail, <HI>I say,</HI> from hence in seven Days, and
finding the Coast lie fairly on our Starboard
side, kept the Land on Board all the Way
Distance about three Leagues; and it held us
thus, about an hundred and twenty Leagues due
<HI>East;</HI> when, on a sudden, we lost Sight of
the Land; whether it broke off, or whether it
only drew off farther <HI>South,</HI> we could not tell.</P>
<P>We went on two or three Days more, our Course
<HI>S. E.</HI> when we made Land again: but found it
to be onely two small Islands, lying <HI>S.</HI> and by <HI>E.</HI>
Distance nine Leagues. We stood on to them,
and two of our Boats went on Shore, but found
nothing for our Purpose; no Inhabitants, nor
any living Creatures, except Sea Fowls, and
some large Snakes; neither was there any fresh
Water. So we call'd that Land Cape <HI>Dismal.</HI></P>
<P>The same Evening, we stood away full <HI>South,</HI>
to see if we could find out the Continuance of
the former Land: But as we found no Land, so
a great Sea coming from the <HI>South</HI> we conclud∣ed,
we should find no Land that Way. And vary∣ing
our Course <HI>Easterly,</HI> we ran, with a fair fresh
Gale at <HI>N. W.</HI> and by <HI>W.</HI> for seven Days more;
in all which Time, we saw nothing but the open
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
Sea, every Way; and, making an Observation,
found, we had pass'd the <HI>Southern Tropick;</HI> and
that we were in the Latitude of six and twenty
Degrees and thirteen Minutes; after which, we
continued our Course still <HI>Southerly</HI> for several Days
more; 'till we found by another Observation,
that we were in two and thirty Degrees, and
twenty Minutes.</P>
<P>This Evening we made Land over our Starboard
Bow, Distance six Leagues, and stood away <HI>South</HI>
and by <HI>East:</HI> But the Wind slackening, we lay
by in the Night; and, in the Morning, found
the Land bearing <HI>East</HI> and by <HI>S.</HI> Distance one
League and a half; a good Shore and sounding,
we found about five and thirty Fathom, stony
Ground. Then we hoisted our Boat out, and sent
it on Shore for Discoveries, to sound the Depth
of the Water, and see for a good Harbour to put
in at.</P>
<P>They went quite in with the Shore, where
they found People, Men, and Women, crowd∣ing
together to look at us. When our Men came
close to the Land, they hung out a white Flag;
but the wild People understood nothing of the
meaning of it; but stood looking and amaz'd;
and we have great Reason to believe, that they
never had seen any Ship or Bark of any Nation,
in all their Lives, but their own. We found no
Boats, or Sails, or any Thing they had, to make
use of on the Water: But some Days after, we
saw several small Canoes, with three or four Men
in each.</P>
<P>Our Men not being able to speak any Thing
for them to understand, or to understand any
Thing they said, the first Thing they did, was,
to make Signs to them, for something to eat.
<PB N="136" REF="139"/>
Upon which, three of them seem'd to go away,
and coming again in a few Minutes, brought
with them several Bundles or Bunches of Roots;
some Plantanes, and some green Lemons, or
Limes, and laid down all upon the Shore. Our
Men took Courage then to go on Shore, and
taking up what they brought, they set up a
Stick, and upon the End of it, hung five Bunches
or Strings, of blew and white Beads, and went
on Board again.</P>
<P>Never was such Joy among a wild People
discover'd, as these People shew'd, when they
took the Beads off the Stick: They danc'd, and
caper'd, and made a thousand antick Gestures;
and, inviting our Men on Shore, laid their
Hands upon their Breasts across; and then
look'd up, intimating a solemn Oath, not to hurt
us.</P>
<P>Our Men made Signs, by which they made
them understand, that they would come again
next Morning, and also that they should bring us
more Eatables; accordingly, we sent three Boats
the next Morning, and our Men carried Knives,
Cissars, Beads, Looking-Glasses, Combs and any
Toys they had, not forgetting Glass-Beads, and
Glass-Earings in abundance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> were very ready to meet us, and
brought us Fruits and Herbs as before; but
Three of them, who stood at a Distance, held
each of them a Creature exactly like a Goat, but
without Horns or Beard; and these were brought
to Traffick with us.</P>
<P>We brought out our Goods, and offer'd every
One something, but the Variety was Surprizing to
them, who had never seen such Things before.
But that which was most Valuable of all our Things,
<PB N="137" REF="140"/>
was a Hatchet, which one of their principal
Men took up, and look'd at it, felt of the Edge,
and lay'd it down; then took it up again, and
wanted to know the use of it: Upon which one
of our Men took it, and stepping to a Tree that
stood near, cut off a small Bough of it at one
Blow: The Man was Surpriz'd, and run to the
Tree with it, to see if he could do so too;
and finding the Vertue of it, he lay'd it down,
ran with all his Might into the Country, and
by and by returning, came with two Men more
with him, to shew them this wonderful Thing
call'd a Hatchet.</P>
<P>But if they were Surpriz'd with the Novelty
of a Hatchet, our Men were as much Surpriz'd
to see hanging round the Ears of both the Men
that he brought with him, large flat pieces of Pure
Gold, and the Thread which they Hung by, was
made of the Hair of the Goats twisted very pret∣tily
together and strong enough.</P>
<P>Our Men offering to Handle them, to see if
they were Gold, one of the Men takes off his
two Bobs, or what we might call them, and offer∣ed
them to our Men for the Hatchet; our Men
seemed to make some Difficulty of it, as if the
Hatchet was of much greater Value than those
Trifles; upon which, he being, as we found, Su∣perior,
made the other that came with him, pull
off his two Ear-Jewels also; and so our unreaso∣nable
People took them all Four, being of Pure
Gold, and Weighing together some Grains above
two Ounces, in Exchange for an old rusty Hatchet.
Well, however Unreasonable the Price was, they
did not think it so; and so over-fond was he of the
Hatchet, that as soon as he had it for his own,
he run to the Tree, and in a few Minutes had so
<PB N="138" REF="141"/>
lay'd about him with the Hatchet, that there
was not a Twig left on it that was within his
reach.</P>
<P>This Exchange was a particular Hint to me;
and I presently Directed my Chief-Mate, and Cap∣tain
<HI>Merlotte,</HI> to go on Shore the next Day, and
acquaint themselves as much as they could with
the Natives, and if possible, to find out where
they had this Gold, and if any Quantity was to
be found.</P>
<P>They bestowed their Time so well, and oblig'd
the Natives so much, by the Toys and Trifles they
gave them, that they presently told them that
the Gold, which they call'd <HI>Aarah,</HI> was pick'd
up in the Rivers that came down from a Moun∣tain
which they pointed to, a great way off. Our
Men prevailed with three of them, to go with
them to one of these Rivers, and gave them
Beads and such Things to encourage them, but by
the way, no Hatchet: That was kept up at a high
Rate, and as a Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, fit only for a King or some
Great Man that wore <HI>Aarah</HI> on his Ears.</P>
<P>In a Word, they came to the River, where,
they said, they found this <HI>Aarah;</HI> and the first
Thing our Men observ'd there, was an <HI>Indian</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting on the Ground, and beating something
upon a great Stone, with another Stone in his
Hand, for his Hammer: they went to see what
he was doing, and found, he had found a Lump
of Gold in the Sand, as big as a Swan Shot,
of no regular Shape; but full of Corners,
neither round or square; and the Man was beat∣ing
it flat, as well as he could.</P>
<P>One of our Men, who had a Hatchet in his
Hand, made Signs to him, to let him flat it for
him; and so turning the back Part of the
<PB N="139" REF="142"/>
Hatchet, which, by the Way, turn'd the Hatch∣et
into a Hammer; he beat the Piece of Gold flat
in an Instant; and then turning the Edges, beat
it that Way, 'till he brought it to be round also.</P>
<P>This was so surprizing to the Man that was
beating, that he stood looking on, with all the
Tokens of Joy and Amazement; and desiring to
see the Hatchet, look'd this Way and that Way,
upon those of his Country Men, who came with
us; as if asking them, if ever they saw the like.</P>
<P>When our Man had done, he made Signs to
know if he had any more <HI>Aarah;</HI> the Man said
nothing, but went down to the Brink of the
River; and putting his Hand into a Hole, he
brought out three little Lumps of Gold, and a great
many smaller, some of them about as big as a
great Pin's Head; all which he had laid up there,
in the hollow of a pretty big Stone. Our Man
thought it was too much, to take all that for
the Hatchet; and therefore pull'd out some
Beads, and Pieces of Glass, and such Toys; and
in short, bought all this Cargo of Gold; which,
in the whole, weigh'd near five Ounces, for about
the Value of two Shillings.</P>
<P>Tho' these Bargains were very agreeable to us,
yet the Discovery of such a Place, and of such a
Fund of Treasure, in a Part of the World,
which, it is very probable, was never seen be∣fore,
by any <HI>European Eyes,</HI> nor so much as
enquir'd after, was the greatest Satisfaction ima∣ginable
to me; knowing the adventurous Tem∣per
of the Gentleman, who was our principal
Employer. Upon this Account, while my Men
busied themselves in their daily Search after
Gold, and in finding out the Rivers, from
whence it came; or rather where it was found:
<PB N="140" REF="143"/>
I employ'd my self to be fully inform'd, where
this Place was; whether it was an Island, or a
Continent; and having found a tolerable good
Road for our Ships to ride in; I caus'd my
two Shallops well mann'd to run along the
Coast, both <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West,</HI> to find which Way
it lay; and whether they could' find any End of
it; as also to see, what Rivers, what People,
and what provisions, they could meet with.</P>
<P>By my Observation, I found, as above, that we
were in the Latitude of seven and twenty De∣grees
and thirteen Minutes, <HI>South</HI> Meridian; di∣stance
from the <HI>Ladrones</HI> about sixteen Degrees
<HI>East</HI> While my Shallops were gone, I went on
Shore, and some of my Men set up Tents on
Shore, as well for the Convenience of their Traf∣fick,
as for their resting on Shore all Night;
keeping however, a good Guard, and having two
of our Ship Dogs with them, who never fail'd
giving them Notice, when ever any of the Na∣tives
came near them; for what ail'd the Dogs, I
know not, but neither of them could bear the
Sight of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and we had much to do, to
keep them from flying at them.</P>
<P>While we rode here, we had the most violent
Storm of Wind, with Rain, and with great Claps,
of Thunder, that we had yet sustain'd, since we
came out of <HI>England:</HI> It was our Comfort, that
the Wind came of Shore, for it blew at <HI>South,</HI>
and shifting between the S. S. E. and S. W. with
such excessive Gusts, and so furious, and withal,
not only by Squals and sudden Flaws, but a
fettled terrible Tempest; that had it been from
off sea, as it was off Shore, we must have perish'd
there had been no Remedy: And even as it was,
we rode in great Danger. My Boatswain call'd
<PB N="141" REF="144"/>
twice out to me, to cut my Masts by the
Board, protesting, we should either bring our
Anchors home, or founder as we rode; and in∣deed,
the Sea broke over us many Times, in a
terrible Manner: As I said before, we had
an indifferent good Road, and so we had, but
not a very good one for the Land was low; and
on the <HI>East</HI> we lay a little open. However, our
Ground Tackle was good, and our Ship very
tight, xand I told the Boatswain, I would rather
slip the Cable, and go of to Sea, than cut the
Masts. However, in about four hours Time more,
we found the Wind abate, but it blew very hard
for three Days after that.</P>
<P>I was in great Pain for my two Shallops in
this Tempest, but they had both the good Luck
to lie close under the Shore; and one indeed had
hauld quite upon the Land, where the Men lay on
Shore under their Sail; so that they got no
Damage; and about three Days after, one of
them return'd, and brought me Word, they had
been, to the <HI>West</HI> where they had made very little
Discovery, as to the Situation of the Country;
and whether it was an Island, or a Continent;
but they had convers'd with the Natives very
often, and had found several, that had Pieces of
Gold, hanging some in their Hair, some about
their Necks; and they made a shift to bring'as
many with them, as weigh'd, all put together,
seventeen or eighteen Ounces, for which they
had bartere'd Toys and Trifles, as we did; but
they found no Rivers, where they could dis∣cover
any Gold in the Sands, as we had done,
so that they believ'd, it all came from that Side,
where we were.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="145"/>
But our other Shallop had much better Luck
she went away to the <HI>East,</HI> and by the Time she
had gone about sixteen Leagues, she found the
Shore break off a little, and soon after, a little
more, 'till at length they came, as it were, to
the Land's End; when, the Shore running due
<HI>South,</HI> they follow'd, according to their Account,
near thirteen Leagues more.</P>
<P>In this Time, they went several Times on
Shore, entered three Rivers indifferently large,
and one of them very large at the Mouth, but
grew narrow again, in three or four Leauges;
but a deep Channel, with two and twenty to
eight and twenty Fathom Water in it all the
Way, as far as they went.</P>
<P>Here they went on Shore, and traffick'd with
the Natives; who, they found, rude and unpo∣lish'd,
but a very mild inoffensive People; nor
did they find them any thing thievish, much less
treacherous; as in some such Countries is the
Case. They had the good Luck, to find out the
Place, where, as they suppos'd, the King of the
Country resided; which was a Kind of a City,
incompass'd with a River, almost all round; the
River making a Kind of double Horse shoe. The
Manner of their living is too long to describe;
neither could our Men give any Account of their
Government, or of the Customs of the Place;
but what they sought for, was Gold and Provi∣sions,
and of that they got pretty considerable.</P>
<P>They found the <HI>Indians</HI> terribly surpriz'd at
the first Sight of them; but after some Time,
they found means to let them know, they desir'd
a Truce; and to make them understand, what
they meant by it.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="146"/>
At length a Truce being establish'd, the King
came, and with him near three hundred Men;
and soon after the Queen, with half as many
Women. They were not stark naked, neither
Men or Women, but wearing a loose Piece of Cloth
about their Middles; what it was made of, we
could not imagine: For it was neither Linnen or
Woolen, Cotton or Silk; nor was it woven;
but twisted and breeded by Hand, as our Women
make Bone Lace with Bobbins. It seems it was
the Stalk of an Herb, which this was made with;
and was so strong, that I doubt not, it would
have made Cables for our Ships, if we had
wanted to make such an Experiment.</P>
<P>When the King first came to four Men, they were
a little shy of his Company, he had so many with
him, and they began to retire; which the King
perceiving, he caus'd all his Men to stop, and
keep at a Distance; and advanc'd himself, with
about ten or twelve of his Men, and no more.</P>
<P>When he was come quite up, our Men, to
shew their Breeding, pull'd off their Hats, but
that he did not understand; for his Men had no
Hats on. But the Officer making a Bowe to him,
he understood that presently, and bow'd again;
at which all his Men fell down flat upon their
Faces, as flat to the Ground, as if they had been
shot to Death with a Volley of our Shot; and
they did not fall so quick, but they were up
again as nimbly, and then down flat on the
Ground again; and this they did three Times,
their King bowing himself to our Men, at the
same Time.</P>
<P>This Ceremony being over, our Men made
Signs to them that they wanted Victuals to Eat,
and something to Drink; and pull'd out several
<PB N="144" REF="147"/>
Things, to let the People see the wou'd give
something for what they might bring them.</P>
<P>The King understood them presently, and
turning to some of his Men, he talk'd a while to
them, and our Men observed, that while he spoke,
they seemed to be terrified, as if he had been
Threatening them with Death. However, as
soon as he had done, three of them went away,
and our Men supposed they went to fetch some∣thing
that the King wou'd give them; upon which,
that they might be before Hand with them, our
Men presented his Majesty with two Pair of
Bracelets of fine Glass-Beads of several Colours,
and put them upon his Arms, which he took most
kindly; and then they gave him a Knife, with
a good plain Ivory Handle, and some other odd
Things. Upon receiving these noble Presents,
he sends away another of his Men, and a little
after, two more.</P>
<P>Our Men observed, that two of the Men went
a great way off toward the Hill, but the other
Man that he sent away first, went to his Queen,
who with her Retinue of Tawny Ladies, stood
but a little way off, and soon after her Majesty
came with four Women only, attending her.</P>
<P>The Officer who commanded our Men, finding
he should have another kind of Compliment to
pay the ladies, retired a little; and being an
ingenious handy sort of a Man, in less than half
an Hour, he, and another of his Men, made a
nice Garland, or rather a Coronet of sundry
Strings of Beads, and with Glass Bobs and Pen∣dants,
all hanging about it most wonderful gay;
and when the Queen was come, he went up to
the King, and showing, it to him, made Signs that
he would give it to the Queen.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="148"/>
The King took it; but was so pleased with it,
that truly he desired our Officer to put it upon
his own Head, which he did; but when he had
got it upon his own Head, he made bold to let
our Men see, he was King over his Wife, as
well as over the rest of the Country, and that he
would wear it himself.</P>
<P>With that our Man pulled out a little Pocket
Looking-Glass, and holding it up, he let his Ma∣jesty
see his own Face, which we might reasonably
suppose, he had never seen before, especially not
with a Crown on his Head too: That till that
Looking-Glass came, and he saw his own-Face, he
was Grave and Majestick, and carried it something
like a King; but he was so ravished with this, that
he was quite beside himself, and Jump'd and
Caper'd and Danc'd about like a Mad-Man.</P>
<P>All this while, our Men saw nothing coming,
but that all was given on their Side; whereupon
they made Signs again, that they wanted Provi∣sions;
He made Signs again, pointing to a Hill a
good way of as if it wou'd come from thence ve∣ry
quickly; and then look't to see if they were
coming, as if he was impatient till they came, as
well as our People.</P>
<P>During this Time, one of our Men observ'd,
that the Queen had several Pieces of Gold, as
they thought them to be, hanging about her,
as particularly in her Hair, and large flat Plats of
Gold upon the hinder part of her Head, some∣thing
in the place of a Roll as our Women wear;
that her Hair was wound about it in Rolls
Breeded together very curiously; and having
inform'd our Officer, he made Signs to the King,
for Leave to give the Queen something, which
he Consented to. So he went to her Majesty,
<PB N="146" REF="149"/>
making a Bowe as before: But this Compli∣sance
Surprized her; for upon his Bowing himself,
on a sudden falls the Queen and all her four La∣dies
flat on the Ground, but were up again in a
Moment; and our People wondered how they
could throw themselves so flat on their Faces, and
not hurt themselves; nor was it less to be won∣der'd
at, how they could so suddenly jump up
again, for they did not rise up gradually as we
must do, with the Help of our Hands and Knees,
if we were extended so flat on our Faces; but
they, with a Spring, whether with their Hands
or their whole Bodies we know not, jumped up
all at Once, and were upon their Feet imme∣diately.</P>
<P>This Compliment over, our Officer stept up
to the Queen, and ties about her Neck, a most
delicate Necklace of Pearl; <HI>That is to say,</HI> of large
handsome white Glass Beads, which might in <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
cost about Four Pence Halfpenny, and to
every one of her Ladies, he gave another of smal∣ler
Beads and differing Colours than those which
he gave the Queen: Then he presented her Majes∣ty
with a long String of Glass-Beads, which
being put over her Head, reached down to her
Waste before, and joyn'd in a kind of a Tossel,
with a little Knot of blew Ribband, which she
was also extreamly pleased with; and very fine
she was.</P>
<P>The Queen made, it seems, the first Return; for
stopping to one of her Women, our Men obser∣ved
that she took something out of her Hair, and
she let her tye her Hair up again; after which she
brought it, and gave it to our Officer, making
Signs to know if it was acceptable: It was a
Piece of Gold that weighed about two Ounces
<PB N="147" REF="150"/>
and a half; it had been beaten as flat as they knew
how to beat it. But the Metal was of much
more Beauty to our Men, than the Shape.</P>
<P>Our Officer soon let them see that he accepted
the Present, by laying it to his Mouth and to his
Breast, which he found was the Way when they
liked any Thing. In short, our Officer goes to
Work again, and in a little while, he makes a little
Coronet for the Queen, as he had done before,
tho' less, and without asking Leave of the King,
went up to her, and put in upon her Head; and
then gave her a little Looking-Glass, as he had
done to the King, to look at her self.</P>
<P>She was so Surpriz'd with this, that she knew
not what to do with her self; but to shew her
Gratitude, she pulled out another Place of Gold
out of her own Hair, and gave it to our Officer;
and not Content with that, she sent one of her
Women to the Crowd of Women that first
attended her, and whether she Stript them of
all the Gold they had, we know not, but she
brought so many Pieces, that when our Men
had them (for she gave all to them) they weigh'd
almost two pound weight.</P>
<P>But this was not all, when she was thus drest,
up she stept forward, very nimbly and gracefully
towards the King to show him what she had
got; and finding the King, dress'd up as fine as
her self, they had Work enough for near two
Hours, to look at one another and admire their
new Ornaments.</P>
<P>Our Men reported, that the King was a Tall
well Shap'd Man, of a very Majestick Deport∣ment,
only that when he laugh'd, he shewed his
Teeth too much, which however, were as white
as Ivory: As for the Queen, saving that her Skin
<PB N="148" REF="151"/>
was of a Tawny Colour, she was a very pretty
Woman; very Tall, a sweet Countenance, admi∣rable
Features, and in a Word, a compleatly
handsome Lady.</P>
<P>She was very odly Dress'd; she was quite
Naked from her Head to below her Breasts: Her
Breasts were plump and round, not flaggy and
hanging down, as it is General with all the
<HI>Indian</HI> Women, some of whose Breasts hang as
low as their Bellies; but Sitting as Beautifully
up, as if they had been lac'd up with Stays round
her Body; and below her Breast, she had a b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad
piece of a Skin of some curious Creature, spotted
like a Leopard, or rather, as I believe, it was
some fine spotted Deer. This was wrapt round
her very Tight, like a <HI>Body-Girt</HI> to a Horse; and
under this, she had a kind of Petticoat as before
describ'd, hanging down to her Ankles. As for
Shoes or Stockings, they were only such as Na∣ture
had furnished. Her Hair was black, and as
they suppos'd, very long; being wreathed up,
twisted in long Locks about the Plate of Gold
she wore; and when she pulled off the Plate of
Gold as above, it hung down her Back, and upon
her Shoulders Gracefully enough; but it seems she
did not think so, for as soon as she found it so
fallen down, she caused one of her Women to
roll it all up and tye it in a great Knot which hung
down in her Neck, and did not look so well as
when it was loose.</P>
<P>While the King and the Queen were conver∣sing,
together about their fine Things as above,
our Men went back to their Boat where they
left the Purchase they had got, and furnish'd
themselves with other Things sit to Trassick with,
as they saw Occasion; and they were not quite
<PB N="149" REF="152"/>
come up to the King again, when they perceiv'd that
the Men the King had sent up into the Country
were returned; and that they brought with
them a great Quantity of such Provisions as they
had; which chiefly Consisted in Roots and <HI>Maiz</HI> or
<HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and several Fruits which we had
never seen before: Some of them resembled the
large <HI>Europian</HI> Figs, but were not really Figs;
with some great Jars of Water, having Herbs
steeped in it, and Roots, that made it look as
white as Milk, and drank like Milk sweetned
with Sugar, but more Delicious, and exceeding
Cool and Refreshing. They brought also a great
Quantity of Oranges, but they were neither
Sweet nor Sour, and our Men believed they
were not ripe; But when they were Drest,
after the Manner of the Country, which they
shew'd our Men how to do, <HI>That is to say,</HI> to roast
them in the Fire, they eat admirably well, and
our Men brought a great many away to us, and
when we roasted them, they exceeded all that
ever I tasted.</P>
<P>After our Men had received what they brought,
and shewn that they were acceptable to them,
the King made Signs that he wou'd be gone, but
wou'd come again to them the next Morning; and
pointing to the Queen's Head, where the Plate
of Gold had been, that she gave to our Men, inti∣mated,
that he would bring some of that with him
the next Day. But while he was making these
Signs, one of his other Messengers came back and
gave the King something into his Hand, wrapt
up, which our Men could not see: As soon as the
King had it, as if he had been proud to show
our Men that he could make himself and his
Queen as sine as they could make him, he pull'd
<PB N="150" REF="153"/>
it out, and first put it on his Queen (a short
Thing like a Robe) which reached from her Neck,
<HI>for he put it over her Head,</HI> only down to the spot∣ed
Skin which she wore before; and so it covered
her Shoulders and Breast. It was made of an in∣finite
Number and Variety of Feathers, odly,
and yet very curiously put together; and was
Spangl'd, as we may call it, all over, with little
Drops or Lumps of Gold; some no bigger than a
Pins-Head, which had Holes made thro' them,
end were strung Six or Seven together, and so
Tyed on to the Feathers: Some as big as a Large
Pea, hanging single, some as big as a Horse-Bean,
and beaten Flat, and all hanging promiscuously
among the Feathers, without any Order or Shape,
which notwithstanding were very Beautiful in the
Whole, and made the Thing look Rich and Hand∣some
enough.</P>
<P>As soon as he had thus Equipt his Queen, he
put the other on upon himself, which as it was
larger, so it had a Particular in its Shape; namely,
that it covered his Arms almost to his Elbows,
and was so made, that it came round under the
Arm, and being fastned there with a String, made
a kind of Sleeve.</P>
<P>As the King's Robe, or what ever it may be
called, was larger, (for it came down to his Waste)
so it had a great deal more Gold about it, and
larger Pieces than what the Queen wore: When
their Majesties had thus put on their Robes, you
may guess how Glorious they look'd, but espe∣cially
the Queen, who being a most charming
beautiful Creatureas before, was much more so.
When she glitter'd thus all with Gold; our
Men look'd very narrowly to observe whether
there were no Diamonds, and particularly whe∣ther
<PB N="151" REF="154"/>
any Pearl among their Finery, but they
could not perceive any.</P>
<P>In this manner they parted for that Evening;
but the People did not leave them so, for they
throng'd about them; and some brought them Jars
of the white Liquor, some brought them Roots,
so me Fruits, some one Thing some another; and
our Men gave every one of them some small Mat∣ter
or other in Proportion to what they brought.
At last, there came four particular tall lusty Men,
with Bows and Arrows, but before they came
close up to our Men, they laid down their Bows and
Arrows on the Ground, and came forward with all
The Tokens of Friendship, they wereable to make.</P>
<P>They had two Youths with them, each of
which led a tame Fawn of pretty large Growth;
and when the Men came up, they gave the two
Fawns to our Men; who, in Return, gave them,
each of them, a Knife, and some Strings of Beads,
and such Toys as they had.</P>
<P>Our Men observ'd, that all these Men had
little Bits of Gold, some of one Shape, and some
of another, hanging at their Ears; and when
our Men came to be familiar, they ask'd them as
well as they could, where they found that Stuff,
and they made Signs to the Sand in the River;
and then pointed towards that Part of the
Country, where our Ships lay; which signi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied
to our Men, that the Gold was, most of it,
where we lay, not there, where the King and
Queen resided. Nay, when our Men pointed
again to the River where they wore, and went
and took up some of the Sand, as if they would
look for Gold in it, they made Signs of laughing
at it, and that there was nothing to be found
there, but that it lay all the other Way.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="155"/>
And yet two or three of the Men, who, when
the Tide was out, went up the Bank of the
River, two or three Mile upon the Sands, peep∣ing
and trying the Sands as they went; found
three or four little Bits of pure Gold in the
Sands, tho' not bigger than Pins Heads; but no
doubt, farther up the Country, they might have
found more.</P>
<P>These four Men seeing how fond our People
were of the Gold, made Signs, that they could
fetch Gold to them, if they would give them
such Things as they lik'd; and ours again told
them, they should have any Thing they pleas'd;
and, as Earnest, gave them some Peices of Iron,
and Bits of Glass of small Value, both which
they were much delighted with, before Hand.</P>
<P>Early in the Morning, their four Customers
came again, and brought several Men, who
seem'd to be Servants, along with them, loaden
with Refreshments; such as the white Water,
mention'd above; which they brought in earthen
Pots very hard, but made so by the Sun, not by any
other Fire. They brought also three small Deer
with them, and a Kind of Coney or Rabbit, but
larger; which our Men were very glad of. But
that which was above all the rest, they brought
a good Quantity of Gold Dust, that is to say,
some in small Lumps, some in bigger; and one
of them had near a Pound weight, wrap'd up in
a piece of Coney Skin, which was all so very
small, that it was like Dust; which, as our Men
understood afterwards, was reckon'ed little worth,
because all the bigger Lumps had been pick'd out
of it.</P>
<P>Our Men, you must be sure, were very wil∣ling
to trade for this Commodity, and therefore
<PB N="153" REF="156"/>
they brought out great Variety of Things to
truck with them; making Signs to them, to pick
out what they lik'd; but still keeping a Reserve
for the King and Queen, who they expected.
Above all, they had made a Reserve for the King,
of some extraordinary Hatchets which they had
not yet suffer'd to be seen; with a Hammer or
two, and some drinking Glasses, and the like,
with some particular Toys for the Queen.</P>
<P>But they had Variety enough, (besides this) for
the four Men; who, in short, bought so many
Trinkets and Trifles, that our Men not only got
all the Gold they brought, but the very Pieces of
Gold out of their Ears; in Return for which,
our Men gave them every one a Pair of Ear
Rings, to hang about their Ears, with a fine
Drop; some of green Glass, some red, some
blew; and they were wonderfully pleas'd with
the Exchange; and went back, we may venture
to say, much richer than they came.</P>
<P>As soon as these had done their Market,
and indeed a little before, they perceiv'd at a
Distance, the King and the Queen, coming
with a great Retinue; so they made Signs to our
Men, that they must be gone; and that they
would not have the King know, that they had
been there.</P>
<P>I must confess, the Relation of all this made
me very much repent, that I had not happen'd
to have put in there with the Ships; tho' indeed
as the Road lay open to the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>South</HI>
Winds, it might have been worse another Way;
I mean, when the Storm blew. However as it is,
I must report this Fart, from the Account given
us by my Men.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="157"/>
When the King and Queen came the
second Time, they came together, and dress'd
up, as our Men suppos'd, with the utmost Mag∣nificence;
having the fine feather'd spangl'd
Things about their Shoulders; and the King had
over all his Habit, a fine spotted Robe of Deer
Skins, neatly joyn'd together; and which, as he
manag'd it, cover'd him from Head to Foot;
and in short, it was so very beautiful, that he
really look'd like a King with it.</P>
<P>When he came to our Men, and the Ceremony
of their meeting was over, the King, turning
round, shewed them, that he had brought them
Stores of Provisions; and indeed so he had; for
he had at least fifty Men attending him, loaden
with Roots, and Oranges, and <HI>Maiz,</HI> and such
Things; in short he brought them above twenty
thousand Oranges; a great Parcel of that Fruit
like a Fig, which I mention'd above, and other
Fruits. After which another Party follow'd, and
brought twenty live Deer; and as many of their
Rabbits dead; the latter are as big as our Hares.</P>
<P>As they came up, the King made Signs to our
Men to take them; and our Officer making Signs
to thank his Majesty, he orders one of the
Queen's Attendants, to give him one of the fea∣ther'd
Robes, such a one, as the King himself
had on; and made mighty fine with Lumps and
Tossels of Gold, as the other. And the tawny
Lass advancing to him, offer'd to put it over his
Head; but he took it in his Hand, and put it
on himself; and look'd as like a Jack Pudding in
it, as any one could desire; for it made no
Figure at all upon him, compar'd to what it did
upon the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="158"/>
When they had receiv'd all this, they could
not but make a suitable Return; and therefore
our Officer caus'd his Reserve to be brought out;
and first he gave his Majesty, a Dozen of very
handsome drinking Glasses of several Sizes; with
half a Dozen glass Beekers, or Cups, to the
Queen, for the fame Use. Then he gave the
King a little Hanger, and a Belt to wear it by
his Side; and shew'd him, how to buckle it on,
and take it off; and how to draw it out, and put
it in again.</P>
<P>This was such a Present, and the King was so
delighted with it, that our Officer said, he be∣lieved
the King for two Hours together, did
nothing but draw it and put it up again, put it on,
and pull it off, and the like.</P>
<P>Besides this, he gave the King three Hatchets;
and shew'd them the Uses of them; also two large
Hammers and a pair of very strong large Sheers,
particularly showing him, that with those Ham∣mers,
they might beat out the Gold Lumps
which they found in the Rivers, and with the
Sheers might cut the Edges round, or into what
Shape they pleas'd, when they were beaten thin.</P>
<P>To the Queen he gave six little Knives, and a
dozen small Looking-Glasses for her Ladies. Six
pair of Cisars, and a small Box full of large
Needles; then he gave her some course brown
Thread, and show'd her how to thred the Needle
and sow any Thing together with the Thread;
all which she admired exceedingly, and call'd her
Tawny Maids of Honour about her, that they
might learn also. And whil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they were standing
all together, our Officer (to make the King
Laugh) Sewed two of her Women one to ano∣ther
by the Lap of their Wast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>coats, or what else
<PB N="156" REF="159"/>
it might be called; and when they were a little
Surpriz'd at it, and began (as he thought) to be a
little Uneasy, he took the Cissars, and at one
Snap, set them at Liberty again: Which pass'd
for such an extraordinary Piece of Dexterity,
that the King wou'd needs have two of them
Sew'd together again, on purpose to see it Cut
again: And then the King desired he might have
a Needle and Thread himself, and a pair of
Cissars: Then he wou'd Sew some things together
and Cut them asunder again several Times, and
Laugh most heartily at the Ingenuity of it.</P>
<P>Besides these Things, they gave her Majesty a
pair of Ear-Rings to hang on her Ears, the Glass
in them looking Green like an Emrald; a Ring of
Silver with false Stones in it, like a Rose Diamond
Ring, the Middle Stone red like a Ruby; which
she went presently and gave to the King; but our
Officer made Signs that he had one that was bigger
for the King, and accordingly gave the King
one much larger: And now they had done giv∣ing
Presents, as they thought, when the King
made a Sign to the Queen, which she under∣stood,
and calling one of her Women, she brought
a small parcel, which the Queen gave our Officer
into his Hand; wherein was about Eleven pound
Weight of Gold-Dust, but as before, no big
Lumps in it.</P>
<P>Our Men having thus finish'd their Traffick, and
being about to come away, they made Signs
to the King, that they wou'd come again and
bring him more sine Things; at which the King
Smiles, and pointed to the Gold, as if telling them
he wou'd have more of that for them when they
came again.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="160"/>
Our Men had now their Expectations fully
answer'd; and, as I said, had ended their Traffick;
and taking Leave of the King, and all his Retinue,
retired to their Shallop, the King and Queen
going away to their City as above; the
Wind blowing <HI>Northerly,</HI> they were seven Days
before they got down to us in the Ship; during
which time, they had almost Famish'd the Deer
they had left; Five of which they had kept to
bring us alive, and yet they went two or three
times on Shore to get Food for them by the
way.</P>
<P>We were all glad to see them again, and I had
a great deal of Reason to be very well satisfied
with the Account of their Traffick, tho' not much
with their Discovery, for they were not able to
give us the least Account whether that Land was
a Continent or an Island.</P>
<P>But let that be how it will, 'tis certainly a
Country yet Unfrequented by any of the Christian
part of Mankind, and perhaps may ever be so,
and yet may be as rich as any other part of the
World yet discover'd. The Mountains in most
of the Islands, as well as of the main Land in those
Parts abounding in Gold or Silver, and no questi∣on,
as well worth searching after, as the Coast
of <HI>Guinea;</HI> where, tho' the Quantity they find
is considerable, yet, it is at this Time sought after
by so many, and the Negroes taught so well
how to Value it, that but a little is brought
away at a Time, and so much given for it, that
Computing the Charge of the Voyage, is often
times more than it is worth.</P>
<P>Whereas tho' it is true, that what Gold is found
here is a great way off; yet, I am persuaded,
such Quantities are to be had, and the Price given
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>
for it so very Trifling, that it wou'd be well
worth searching for.</P>
<P>I reckon, that including the Gold our Shallop
brought and what we goton <HI>Shore</HI> where we lay, we
brought away about twenty four pound Weight
of Gold: The Expence of which, we could not
Value at above ten or eleven Pound in <HI>England</HI>
put it all together; and reckoning for all the
Provisions we got there, which supply'd us for
twenty Days after we came away.</P>
<P>For while our Shallop was making her Visit
thus to the Royal Family, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as is related;
our Men were not Idle on Shore, but partly by
Trade with the Natives, and by Washing the
Sands in the small Rivers, we got such a Quantity
of Gold, as well Satisfied us for the Stay we made.</P>
<P>We had been about eighteen Days here when
our Shallop returned, and we stay'd a Week
more Trafficking with the People: And I am
persuaded, if we had a mind to have settled
there and stay'd till now, we should have been
very Welcome to the People. We saw neither
Horse or Cow, Mule, Ass, Dog or Cat, or any
of our <HI>European</HI> sort of Creatures (except that our
Men shot some Wild-Ducks and Wigeon exactly
the same which we see in <HI>England,</HI> and very Fat
and Good, but much easier to shoot than in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
having never been acquainted with the Flash
and Noise of Guns as ours have been: We also
found a Sort of Patridges in the Country not
much unlike our own, and a great many of the
Whistling Plover the same with Ours.</P>
<P>Tho' this Months Stay was Unexpected, yet,
we had no Reason to think our Time ill spent.
However, we did not think we ought to lie
here too long what ever we got: So we Weigh'd
<PB N="159" REF="162"/>
and stood off to Sea, steering still <HI>S. E.</HI> keeping
the Shore of this Golden Country in Sight, till our
Men told us they found the Land fall off to the
<HI>South:</HI> Then we Steer'd away more <HI>Southerly</HI> for
six or eight Days, not losing Sight of Land all the
Time, till by an Observation, we found we were
in the Latitude of thirty four Degrees and a Half,
<HI>South</HI> of the Line; our Meridian distance from the
<HI>Ladrones,</HI> twenty two Degrees thirty Minutes <HI>East;</HI>
when a fresh Gale of Wind springing up at <HI>South</HI>
and by <HI>East,</HI> oblig'd us to Hale Close for that
Evening; at Night it blew such a Storm, that
we were oblig'd to yield to the Force of it,
and go away afore it to the <HI>N.</HI> or <HI>N.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> till
we came to the point of that Land we past before;
here the Land tending to the <HI>West</HI> we run in
under the Lee of a steep Shore, and came to an
Anchor in twenty five Fathom Water, being the
same Country we were in before. Here we rid
very safe for five Days, the Wind continuing to
blow very hard all the Time from the <HI>South East.</HI></P>
<P>My Men would fain have had me gone a Shore
again, and traffick'd with the People for more Gold;
but I, who was still in quest of farther Discove∣ries,
thought, I knew enough of this Place, to
tempt my Friend, the Merchant, whose favou∣rite
Design was that of making new Discoveries,
to another Voyage there; and that was enough for
me. So I declin'd going on Shore again, except,
that we sent our Boats for a Recruit of fresh
Water; and our Men, while they were filling it,
shot a Brace of Deer, as they were feeding by the
Side of a swamp or moist Ground; and also
some wild Ducks. Here we set up a great wood∣en
Cross, and wrote on it, the Names of our
Ships, and Commanders; and the Time that we
came to an Anchor there.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="163"/>
But we were oblig'd to a farther Discovery
of this Country than we intended, by the fol∣lowing
Accident: We had unmoor'd early in
the Morning, and by eight a Clock were un∣der
Sail; by ten we had doubled the Point I
mentioned above, and stood away S. keeping the
Shore on Board, at the Distance of about two
Leagues <HI>West.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day, the Officer, who had been
with the Shallop, shew'd us the Opening or
Mouth where he put in, and where he had
made his Traffick with the King of the Coun∣try,
as you have heard.</P>
<P>We went on still for two Days, and still we
found the Land extending it self <HI>South</HI> till the third
Day in the Morning, we were a little surpriz'd to
find our selves, as it were, embay'd; being in the
Bottom of a deep Gulph, and the Land ap∣pearing
right a Head, Distance about three
Leagues; the Coast having turn'd away to the <HI>East</HI>
and by <HI>South,</HI> very high Land and Mountainous;
and the Tops of some of the Hills cover'd with
Snow.</P>
<P>Our second Mate and the Boatswain, upon
this Discovery, were for coming about, and sent
to me for Orders to make Signals to the other
Ship and our Brigantine, who were both a∣Head,
to do the like; but I, who was willing
to acquaint my self, as fully as I could, with
the Coast of the Country, which I made no
Question I should have Occasion to come to
again, said, NO NO, I will see a little far∣ther
first. So I run on, having an easy Gale
at N. E. and good Weather, till I came within
about League and a Half of the Shore, when
I found, that in the very Bite or Nook of the
<PB N="161" REF="164"/>
Bay, there was a great Inlet of Water, which
either must be a Passage or Streight between the
Land we had been on Shore upon; which in
that Case, must be a great Island, or that it must
be the Mouth of some extraordinary great Ri∣ver.</P>
<P>This was a Discovery too great to be omit∣ted,
so I order'd the Brigantine to stand in
with an easy Sail, and see what Account could
be had of the Place; Accordingly they stood in,
and we follow'd about a League, and then lay
by, waiting their Signals. I had particularly
ordered them to keep two Boats a Head to
sound the Depth all the Way, and they did so;
and how it happen'd, we know not, but on a
sudden, we heard the Sloop fire two Guns first,
and then one Gun; the first was a Signal to
us to bring too, and come no farther; the next
was a Signal of Distress; we immediately tack'd
to stand off, but found a strong Current setting
directly into the Bite, and there not being Wind
enough for us to stem the Current, we let go
our Anchors in twenty two Fathom Water.</P>
<P>Immediately we mann'd out all the Boats we
had, great and small, to go and assist our Bri∣gantine,
not knowing what Distress she might
be in; and they found she had driven up, as we
were like to have done too far into the Channel
of a large River, the Mouth of which, being
very broad, had several Shoals in it; and tho'
she had drop'd her Anchor just upon Noticewhich
the Boats who were Sounding, gave her; yet she
tayl'd a-Ground upon a Sand, and stuck fast;
our Men made no Doubt but she would be lost,
and began to think of saving the Provisions and
Ammunition out of her. The two Long-Boats
<PB N="162" REF="165"/>
accordingly began to lighten her; and first they
took in her Guns, and let out all her Casks of
Water; then they began to take in her great
Shot and the heavy Goods. But by this Time,
they found their Mistake, for the Current,
which I mention'd, was nothing, but a strong
Tide of Flood; which, the Indraught of the
River being very great, ran up with a very great
Force; and, in something less than an Hour, the
Brigantine fleeted again.</P>
<P>However she stuck so long upon the Sand, and
the Force of the Current or Tide was so great,
that she receiv'd considerable Damage; and had
a great deal of Water in her Hold. I immediately
order'd our Boats to row to the Land, on both
Sides, to see, if they could find a good Place to
lay her on Shore in; they did so, and found a
very convenient Harbour, in the Mouth of a
small River; which empty'd it self into the
great River, about two Leagues within the fore∣land
of it, on the <HI>North</HI> Side; as the River <HI>Med∣way</HI>
runs into the <HI>Thames,</HI> within the Mouth of it,
on the <HI>South</HI> Side; only this was not so far up.</P>
<P>Here they ran in the Sloop immediately, and
the next Day we came thither also; our Boats
having sounded the whole Breadth of the main Ri∣ver,
and found a very good Channel, half a League
broad; having from seventeen to four and
twenty Fathom Water all the Way, and very
good riding.</P>
<P>Here we found it absolutely necessary, to take
every Thing out of the Brigantine, to search her
Bottom; for her lying on Shore had strain'd her
Seams, and broke one of her Floor Timbers;
and having Hands enough, our Men unloaded
her in a very little Time, and making a little
<PB N="163" REF="166"/>
Dock for her, mended all the Damage in about
ten Days Time. But seeing her in so good a Con∣dition,
and the Place so convenient, I resolv'd to
have her whole Bottom new calk'd and payd; so
we made her as clean as she was when she first
came off the Stocks.</P>
<P>This I took for a good Opportunity, to ca∣reen
and clean our other Ships too; for we had
done little to them since we came from <HI>Mada∣gascar.</HI>
We found our <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship much
Worm eaten in her sheathing, which we help'd
as well as we could, by new nailing, and by
taking out some Pieces of her sheathing, and
putting new ones in. But as to our great Ship,
she was sheath'd with Lead, and so had receiv'd
no Damage at all; only that she was very foul,
which we remedied by scraping and cleaning,
and new graving her quite over.</P>
<P>We were not all employ'd in this Work, and
therefore we had Leisure to make the best of our
Time, for the main Work of new Discoveries.
And now I resolv'd to leave it no more to under
Officers, as I had done before, <HI>viz.</HI> when I gave the
Command of the Shallop, that traded with the
King and Queen, as above, to a Midship Man,
which I was very sorry for, tho' the Fellow did
his Business very well too; but I say, I resolv'd
not to trust any one now, but my self.</P>
<P>In the first Place, I took the two Shallops,
and went cross the mouth of the great River, to
the <HI>South</HI> Shore, to see what Kind of a Country
was to be found there. For, as to the <HI>North</HI>
Side where we were, we found it to be much
the same, with that Part where we had been
before; only that we found no Gold, nor did
we perceive, that the People had any.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="167"/>
I found the Mouth of this River or Inlet, to
be about four Leagues over, where I cross'd it,
which was about three Leagues and a half within
the Inlet it self. But the Weather being very
calm, and the Flood Tide running sharp, we let
our Boat drive up in our crossing, about two
Leagues more; and we found the Channel grew
narrow so fast, that where we came to Land, it
was not full a League over; that about three
Leagues farther, we found it a meer River, not
above as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Blackwall.</HI></P>
<P>We found it a stleep Shore, and observing a
little Creek very convenient for our Purpose,
we ran in our Boats among some Flags or Rushes;
and lay'd them as soft and as safe, as if they had
been in a Dock; we went all on Shore immedi∣ately,
except two Men in each Boat, left to
guard our Provisions.</P>
<P>We had for Arms, every Man a Musquet, a
Pistol, and a Cutlass; and in each Boat we had
six half Pikes to use, as we might have Occasion.
We had also every Man a Hatchet, hung in a
little Frog at his Belt; and in each Boat a broad
Ax and a Saw.</P>
<P>We were furnish'd with Strings of Beads, Bits
of Glass, Glass Rings, Earings, Pearl Necklaces,
and such like Jewelry Ware, innumerable; besides
Knives, Cissars, Needles, Pins, Looking-glasses,
Drinking-glasses, and Toys great Store.</P>
<P>We were no sooner on Shore, but we found
People in Abundance; For there were two or
three small Towns within a little Way of the
Shore; and I suppose, we might have the more
People about us, because, as we understood after∣wards,
they had seen us before, tho' we had not
seen them.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="168"/>
We made Signs to them, by putting our Fin∣gers
to our Mouths, and moving our Chops, as
if we were eating, that we wanted Provisions;
and we hung up a white Flag for a Truce. They
presently understood the first Signal, but knew
nothing of the last; and as to Provisions, just as
had been the Case before, they brought us out
Roots, and Fruits, such as they eat themselves;
but such as we had never seen before. Some of
them, however, were very sweet and good, and
when we boy'ld them, they eat much like an
<HI>English</HI> Parsnip; and we gave them Strings of
Beads, Pieces of Glass, and such Things as we
found, they were always very fond of.</P>
<P>We found the People, as I observ'd of the
other, very inoffensive and sincere; not quarrel∣some,
nor treacherous, or mischievous in the
least. And we took Care, not so much as to let
them know the Use, or Manner of our Fire
Arms a great while; neither was there one Piece
fir'd, all the Time we were among the other
People, where we had so much Gold: If there
had, it had been very probable, that they would
have fled the Country, in spight of all the
good Usage we could have been able to have
shewn them.</P>
<P>The People, where we were now, were
not so rich in Gold, as these where we were
before; But we found them much better stor'd
with Provisions; for besides Deer, of which they
had great Plenty and Variety, for they had some
of a Sort, which I had never seen before, and
besides an infinite Number of those Rabbits,
which I mention'd before, which were as big as
our Hares, and which do not burrough in the
Ground, as our Conies do; they had a Kind of
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
Sheep, large, (like those of <HI>Peru,</HI> where they are
us'd to carry Burthens;) and very good. They have
no Wool nor Horns, but are rather hairy, like a
Goat; nor should I call them Sheep, but that
their Flesh eats like Mutton; and I know not
what else to call them. The Natives call'd them
<HI>Huttash;</HI> but what Breed, or from what Part of
the World, or whether created for a Peculiar to
this Part, I know not.</P>
<P>However, their Flesh was very agreeable, and
they were fat and good; and as the <HI>Indians</HI> were
mightily pleas'd with the Price we paid them,
and the Goods we paid them in, they brought
us more of these <HI>Huttashes</HI> than we knew what to
do with; and as I can calculate the Rate, I
suppose, we might have them for about eight
Pence, or sometimes, not above six Pence cost each;
for they would give us one very thankfully, for a
String or two of small Beads, and think them∣selves
mighty well paid.</P>
<P>I found them so plentiful, and so easy to come
at, that in short, I sent fifty of them alive ty'd
Neck and Heels, in one of the Shallops back to
our Ships; and order'd them to send their long
Boats over for more; for tho' it was so little a
Way over, we did not find, they had any of
them on that Side the River.</P>
<P>We did the <HI>Indians</HI> another Piece of Service;
for if they gave us Meat, we taught them to be
Cooks; for we shew'd them how to roast it upon
a Stick or Spit before the Fire; whereas they eat
all their Meat before, either stew'd in earthen
Pots over the Fire, with Herbs, such as we did
not understand, or thrown on the Coals of green
Wood into the Fire; which, by the Way,
always made it stink of the Smoak most intolerably.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="170"/>
We had a great deal of Opportunity now, to
converse with the People on both Sides the
River; and we found them to be not only
different Nations, but of a differing Speech and
differing Customs. These on the <HI>South</HI> Side, where
I now was, seem'd to be the best furnish'd with
Provisions, and to live in the greatest Plenty.
But those, on the <HI>North</HI> Side, appear'd better
cloath'd, and a more civiliz'd Sort of People; and
of the two seem'd to have, in their Countenances,
something the more agreeable.</P>
<P>However, as they were near Neighbours, for
the River only parted them, they were not very
much unlike neither. That which seem'd most
strange to me, was, that we found they had
little Knowledge or Communication one with
another. They had indeed some Boats in the
River, but they were but small, and rather serv'd
to just wast them over, or to fish in them, than for
any Carriage; for we found none that could
carry above four Men, and these very odly
made; partly as a Canoe, by hollowing a Tree,
and partly by Skins of Beasts, dry'd and stuck on
so, as they made wast Cloths to the other; yet
they would paddle along at a great Rate with
them.</P>
<P>For want of understanding their Language, I
could come at no Knowledge of their Religion or
Worship; nor did I see any Idols among them, or
any Worshipping of the Sun or Moon. But yet,
as a Confirmation that all Nations, however Bar∣barous,
have some Notion of a GOD, and some
Awe of a Superior Power: So I observ'd here,
that being making a Bargain with one of the prin∣cipal
Men, such I perceiv'd him to be by the
Respect the rest shew'd him; I say, being making
<PB N="168" REF="171"/>
a Bargain with him as well as could be done
between People that understood not one Word
of what either of us said, he had made Signs
to bring me twelve Sheep the next Morning,
for some Things that I was to deliver him of mine.
I am sure the Goods were not all of them of Value
sufficient to give me the least Distrust, but when
I gave him the Goods without the Sheep, being
as I said to trust him till next Day, he call'd
two Men to him, and pointing to the Goods that
I had put into his Hands, he tells upon his Fingers
Twelve; letting them know (as I suppose) that
he was to give me twelve Sheep the next Day.
so far it seems they were to be Witnesses of the
Agreement: Then he places his two Hands one
upon each Breast turn'd very accurately with the
Fingers up towards his Face, and holding them
there, he looks towards Heaven, with his Face
turn'd upward and with the most Gravity, Seri∣ousness,
and Solemnity in his Countenance, that
ever I saw in any Mans Face in my Life. When he
had continued in this Posture about a quarter of a
Minute, he takes the two Men, and puts them just
in the same Posture; and then points to me, and
then to himself, by which I understood, first, that
he solemnly swore to me, that he wou'd bring the
Sheep punctually and faithfully to me, and then he
brought the two Men to be Bail or Security for the
Performance; <HI>that is to say,</HI> to oblige themselves
to perform it, if he did not.</P>
<P>Doubtless, those People who have any Notion
of a GOD, must represent Him to themselves
as something Superior, and something that sees
and hears and knows what they say or do. Whe∣ther
these People meant the Sun or the Moon, or
the Stars, or what else I do not Determine for
<PB N="169" REF="172"/>
them, but 'tis Visible they understood it to be
something to swear by; something that could
bear Witness of their Engagement, and that be∣ing
called to Witness of it, could resent the
Breach of Promise. As to those, whose Gods are
Monsters, and hideous Shapes, frightful Images
and terrible Figures, the Motive of their Adora∣tion
being that of meer Terror, they have cer∣tainly
gross Ideas. But these People seem to act
upon a more solid Foundation, paying their
Reverence in amanner much more Rational, and
to something which it was much more reasonable
to Worship; this appear'd in the Solemnity of
their Countenances, and their Behaviour in making
a solemn Promise.</P>
<P>We found those People clothed, generally speak∣ing,
over their whole Bodies, their Heads, Arms,
Legs, and Feet excepted; but not so agreeably as
those we mentioned above; and we found that the
Clothing of these, were generally the Skins of Beasts,
but very artfully put together; so that though they
had neither Needle or Thread, yet they had the
same Plant as I mention'd before, the Stalk of which,
wou'd so strongly tye like a Thread, that they peel'd
it off thicker or finer as they had Occasion, and made
use of it abundance of Ways to Tye and Twist, and
make their Clothes with it, as well for their Occa∣sion,
as if it had been Woven in a Loom.</P>
<P>We found several of these People had little Bits
of Gold about them; but when we made Signs to
them to know where they got it, and where it
might be had: They made Signs again, pointing
to the Country, on the <HI>North</HI> Side the River, so
that we had it seems Chopt upon the right <HI>Gold
Coast,</HI> in our first Coming: They pointed indeed
likewise, to some very high Mountains, which we
<PB N="170" REF="173"/>
saw at a great Distance S. W. so that it seems as I
there was Gold found that way also; but it seems
the People here had not much of it for their share</P>
<P>The Men here, had Bows and Arrows, and
they used them so Dexterously, that a Wild
Goose flying over our Heads, one of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
shot it quite through with an Arrow. One of our
Men was so Provok'd, to see them, as it were, to
out do him; that some time after, seeing a couple
of Ducks flying fair for a Mark, he Presented his
Piece, and shot them both flying.</P>
<P>I was very Angry, when I heard the Gun, had
I been there, he had never got Leave to shoot:
However, when it was done, I was pleas'd well
enough to see the Effect it had upon these poor
innocent Well-Meaning People; at first it Fright∣ed
them to the last Degree, and I may well say, it
Frighted them out of their Wits, for they that
were near it, started so violently, that they fell
down and lay Speechless for some Time: Those that
were farther off, ran away, as if it had been some
new kind of Lightning and Thunder, and came
out of the earth instead of out of the Clouds: But
when they saw the two Creatures fall down dead
out of the Air, and could see nothing that flew up
to them to kill them, they were perfectly astonish'd,
and laid their two Hands on their Breasts, and
looked up to Heaven, as if they were saying their
Prayers, in the solemnest Manner imaginable.</P>
<P>However, this Accident gave them terrible
Ideas of us, and I was afraid at first, they would
run all away from us for fear: I therefore used
them after it, with all the Kindness and Tender∣ness
imaginable; gave them every Day one Trisle
or other, which tho' of no value to me, they
were exceeding fond of; and as we ask'd
<PB N="171" REF="174"/>
nothing of them, but Provisions, of which they
had great Plenty, and gave us enough every Day
to satisfy us: As for Drink, they had none of the
Milky Liquor, which we had on the other part of
the Country: But they had a Root, which they
steep'd in their Water, and made it drink Hot,
as if Pepper had been in it, which made it so
strong, that tho' it wou'd not make our Men
Drunk, it was worse, for it made them Mad.</P>
<P>I was so pleas'd with these People, that I came
over to them every other Day, and some of our
Men lay on Shore, under a Sail pitch'd for a Tent;
and they were so safe, that at last, they kept no
Watch, for the poor People neither thought any
Harm, or did any; and we never gave them the
least, Occasion to apprehend any Thing from us, at
least, not till our Man fir'd the Gun, and that
only let them know we were able to Hurt them,
not giving them the least Suspition that we in∣tended
it; on the Contrary, one of our Men
play'd an odd Prank with them, and fully satisfy'd
them that we would do them no Harm; this Man
having seen one of their Children, a little laughing
speechless Creature, of about two Years old; the
Mother having gone from it a little way, on some
particular Occasion, the Fellow takes it and led it
Home to the Tent, and kept it there all Night.</P>
<P>The next Morning, he drest it up with Beads
and Jewels wondrous fine, Necklace about its
Neck, and Bracelets of Beads about its Wrist,
and several Strings of Beads wrapt up and tyed in
its Hair, having fed it, and laid it to sleep,
and made much of it all Night; in this
Figure, he carried it up in his Arms to the <HI>Indian</HI>
Huts or Houses, where he had found it, and
where there had been, it seems, a great Out-Cry
<PB N="172" REF="175"/>
for the Child all the Night, the Mother crying
and raising her Neighbours, and in a most strange
Concern.</P>
<P>But when some of the Women, her Neighbours,
saw the Child brought back, there was a
contrary Extream of Joy; and the Mother of it,
being (I suppose) fetch'd, she fell a jumping and
dancing, to see her Child, but also making so
many odd Gestures, as our Men could not well
tell for a while, whether she was pleas'd or no:
The Reason it seems, was, she did not know
whether to Hope or Fear, for she did not know
whether the Man wou'd give back her Child, or
take it away again.</P>
<P>But when the Man, who had the Child in his
Arms, had been told by Signs, that this was the
Mother, he beckoned to have her come to him,
and she came, but trembling for Fear. Then he
took the Child, and Kissing it two or three times,
he gave it her into her Arms. But it is impossible, to express, by Words, the Agony the
poor Woman was in; she took the Child, and
holding it in her Arms, fix'd her Eyes upon it
without Motion, or as it were, without Life,
for a good While; then she took it, and Em∣brac'd
it in the most passionate Manner ima∣ginable:
When this was over, she fell a Crying
so Vehemently, till she Sobb'd; and all this while,
spoke not one Word: When the Crying had
given sufficient Vent to her Passion, then she fell
a Dancing, and making a strange odd Noise, that
we cannot Describe, and at last, she leaves the
Child, and comes back to the Place where our
Men were, and to the Man that brought her
Child, and, as soon as she came up to him, she
falls flat on the Ground, as I have Describ'd
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
above, the Queen and her Women did, and up
again immediately; and thus she did three times,
which it seems, was her Acknowlegment to
him for bringing it back.</P>
<P>The next Day, <HI>for her Gratitude did not end
here,</HI> she came down to our Tent, and brought
with her two Sheep with a great back Burthen of
Roots, of the kind, which I said, they steep'd in
the Water; and several Fruits of the Country,
as much as two Men, who came with her, could
carry; and these she gave all to the Man that had
brought back her Child. Our Men were so
mov'd, at the affectionate Carriage of this poor
Woman to her Child, that they told me it
brought Tears out of their Eyes.</P>
<P>They took her Present, but the Man that
receiv'd it, took the Woman, and drest her up as
fine almost as he had done the Child, and she
went Home like a kind of a Queen among them.</P>
<P>We observ'd, while we stay'd here, that this
was a most incomparable Soil, that the Earth was
a fat loomy Mould, that the Herbage was strong,
that the Grass, in some Places, was very rank and
good, being as high as our Mid-Thigh; and that
the Air was neither very Hot, nor as we believe,
very Cold; we made an Experiment of the
Fruitfulness of the Soil, for we took some white
Pease, and digging the Ground up with a Spade,
we sowed some, and before we went away, we
saw them come out of the Ground again, which
was in about nine Days.</P>
<P>We made Signs to the People, that they shou'd
let them grow, and that if they gathered them,
they were good to eat: We also Sow'd some
<HI>English</HI> Wheat, and let them know, as well as
we could, what the Use of them both was. But
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>
I make no doubt, but they have been bette<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
acquainted with both by this time, by an Occasion
which follow'd</P>
<P>Our Men were so fond of this Place, and so
pleas'd with the Temper of the People, the
Fruitfulness of the Soil, and Agrecableness of the
Climate; that about twenty of them offered
me, if I wou'd give them my Word to come
again, or send to them to relieve and supply
them with Necessaries, they wou'd go on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and begin a Colony, and live all their Days there
Nay, after this, their Number came up to three
and thirty; Or, they offer'd, that if I wou'd
give them the Sloop, and leave with them a
Quantity of Goods, especially of such Toys as
they knew wou'd oblige the People to use the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
well, they wou'd stay at all Hazards, not doubt∣ing,
as they told me, but they should come to
<HI>England</HI> again at last, with the Sloop full of Gold▪</P>
<P>I was not very willing to encourage either of
these Proposals, because, as I told them, I might
perhaps find a Place as sit to settle a Colony
in, before we came Home, which was not at such
an excessive Distance from <HI>England,</HI> so that it
was scarce possible ever to relive them. This
satisfied them pretty well, and they were Content
to give over the Project; and yet, at last, which
was more Preposterous than all the rest, five of
our Men and a Boy, ran away from us a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d went
on Shore, and what sort of life they led, or
how they manage, we are scarce ever likely to
know, for they are too far off us to enquire after
them again: They took a small Yaul with them,
and it seems had furnish'd themselves privately
with some necessary Things, especially Tools, a
Grind-Stone, a Barrel of Powder, some Pease, some
<PB N="175" REF="178"/>
Wheat, and some Barly; so that it seems, they are
resolv'd to plant there; I confess I pittied them,
and when I had searched for them, and could not
find them. I caused a Letter to be written to
them, and fixt it up upon a Post, at the Place
where our Ship Careen'd; and another on the
South Side, to tell them, that in such a certain
Place, I had left other Necessaries for them,
which I did, made up in a large Case of Boards
or Planks, and cover'd with Boards like a Shed.</P>
<P>Here I left them Hammocks for Lodging; all
Sorts of Tools for building them a House, Spades,
Shovels, Pick Axes, an Ax, two Saws; with
Clothes, Shoes, Stockings, Hats, Shirts; and in
a Word, every Thing that I could think of for
their Use; and a large Box of Toys, Beads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
to oblige the Trade with the Natives.</P>
<P>One of our Men, who they had made privy to
their Design, <HI>but made him promise not to reveal
it, 'till they were gone;</HI> had told them, that he
would perswade me, if he could, to leave them
a farther Supply; and bid them come to the
Place, after the Ships were gone; and that they
should find Directions left for them, on a Piece
of a Board, or a Letter from him, set up upon a
Post. Thus they were well furnish'd with all
Things for immediate living.</P>
<P>I make no doubt, but they came to find these
Things, and since they had a Mind to make
Tryal of a wild retir'd Life, they might shift
very well. Nor would they want any Thing,
but <HI>English</HI> Women, to raise a new Nation of
<HI>English</HI> People; in a Part of the World, that
belongs neither to <HI>Europe, Asia, Africa,</HI> or
<HI>America.</HI> I also left them every Man another
Gun, a Cutlass, and a Horn for Powder; and I
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
left two Barrels of fine Powder, and two Pigs <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Lead for Shot, in another Chest by it self.</P>
<P>I doubt not, but the Natives will besto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Wives upon them, but what Sort of a Posterit;
they will make, I cannot foresee; For I don'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
find by Enquiry, that the Fellows had any grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Store of Knowledge or Religion in them, being
all <HI>Madagascar</HI> Men, <HI>as we call'd them;</HI> that is to

thens in an Age or two more; tho' I left then
five Bibles, and six or seven Prayer Books, and
good Books of several Sorts; that they might
not want Instruction, if they thought fit to
make Use of it, for themselves or their Progeny.</P>
<P>It is true, this is a Country that is most remote
from us, of any in the yet discover'd World,
and cosequently, it would be suggested as unpro∣fitable
to our Commerce; but I have something
to alledge in its Defence, which will prove it to be
infinitely more advantageous to <HI>England,</HI> than
any of our <HI>East India</HI> Trade can be, or than can
be pretended for it. The Reason is plain in a few
Words: Our <HI>East India</HI> Trade is all carry'd on,
or most Part of it, by an Exportation of Bullion
in Specie; and a Return of foreign Manufactures
or Produce; and most of these Manufactures also,
either trifling and unnecessary in themselves; or
such as are injurious to our own Manufactures.
The solid Goods brought from <HI>India,</HI> which may
be said to be necessary to us, and worth sending
our Money for, are but few; for Example:
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>I. The Returns, which I reckon trifling
and unnecessary, are, such as <HI>China</HI> Ware,
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>
Coffee, Tea, Japan Works, Pictures,
Fans, Skreens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The Returns, that are injurious to our
Manufactures, or Growth of our own
Country; are printed Callicoes, Chints,
wrought Silks, Stuffs of Herba and Barks,
Block-Tin, Sugar, Cotton, Arrack, Cop∣per,
Indico.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The necessary or useful Things are Pep∣per,
salt Peter, dying Woods and dying
Earths, Drugs, Lacks, such as Shel-lack,
Stick-lack, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Diamonds, and some
Pearl, and raw Silk.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
For all these we carry nothing or very little but
Money; the innumerable Nations of the <HI>Indies,
China, &amp;c.</HI> despising our Manufactures, and fil∣ling
us with their own.</P>
<P>On the Countrary, the People in the <HI>Southern</HI>
unknown Countries, being first of all very nume∣rous,
and living in a temperate Climate, which
requires clothing, and having no Manufactures,
or Materials for Manufacturs of their own, wou'd
consequently take off a very great Quantity of
<HI>English</HI> Woollen-Manufactures, especially when
Civiliz'd by our dwelling among them, and
taught the Manner of Clothing themselves for
their Ease and Convenience; and in Return for
these Manufactures, 'tis Evident, we shou'd have
Gold in Specie, and perhaps Spices; the best
Merehandize and Return in the World.</P>
<P>I need say no more to Excite adventurous
Heads to search out a Country, by which such an
Improvement might be made, and which would be
such an Encrease of, or Addition to the Wealth
and Commerce of our Country.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="181"/>
Nor can it be objected here, that this Nook of
the Country may not easily be found by any One
but by us, that have been there before, and per∣haps
not by us again exactly; for not to enter
into our Journal of Observations for their Direc∣tion,
I lay it down as a Foundation; that who∣ever,
Sailing over the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> keeps a stated
Distance from the Tropick to the Latitude of
fifty six, to sixty Degrees, and steers <HI>Eastward</HI>
towards the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magellan,</HI> shall never
fail to discover new Worlds, new Nations, and
new inexhaustible Funds of Wealth and Com∣merce,
such as never were yet known to the
Merchants of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>This is the true Ocean call'd the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> that
Part that we corruptly call so, can be so in no
Geographical Account, or by any Rule but by
the meer Imposition of Custom, it being only
originally call'd so, because they that Sailed
to it, were oblig'd to go round the <HI>Southtermost</HI>
part of <HI>America</HI> to come into it; whereas it ought
indeed to be call'd the <HI>West-Sea,</HI> as it lies on the
<HI>West</HI> Side of <HI>America,</HI> and Washes the <HI>Western</HI>
Shore of that great Continent for near eight
thousand Miles in length; <HI>to wit,</HI> from fifty six
Degrees <HI>South</HI> of the Line, to seventy Degrees
<HI>North;</HI> and how much farther, we know not: On
this Account, I think, it ought to be called the
<HI>American</HI> Ocean, rather than with such Impro∣priety
the <HI>South-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>But this part of the World where we were,
may rightly be called the <HI>SOƲTH-SEA,</HI> by Way
of Distinction, as it extends from <HI>India,</HI> round
the Globe, to <HI>India</HI> again; and lies all <HI>South of
the Line</HI> (even for ought we know) to the very
<HI>South Pole,</HI> and which, except some Interposition
<PB N="179" REF="182"/>
of Land, whether Islands or Continent, really
surrounds the <HI>South</HI> Pole.</P>
<P>We were now in the very Center or Middle of
this <HI>South-Sea;</HI> being, as I have said, in the Lati∣tude
of thirty four Degrees twenty Minutes;
but having had such good Success in our Enquiry,
or Search after new Continents, I resolved to
Steer to the <HI>S.</HI> and <HI>S. E.</HI> as far, as till we shou'd
be interrupted by Land or Ice, determining to
search this unknown Part of the Globe, as far as
Nature wou'd permit, that I might be able to
give some Account to my Employers, and some
Light to other People that might come that
Way, whether by Accident or by Design.</P>
<P>We had spent six and twenty Days in this Place,
as well in Repairing our Brigantine and Careening,
and Triming our Ship, that we had not been so
long, but that we did not resolve to Careen our
Ships, till we had spent ten Days about the Brigan∣tine,
and then we found more Work to do to the
Sheathing of the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship than we expected.</P>
<P>We stored our selves here with fresh Provisions
and Water, but got nothing that we could call a
Store, except the Flesh of about thirty Deer,
which we Dry'd in the Sun, and which eat indiffe∣rently
well afterward, but not exraordinary.</P>
<P>We sailed again the six and twentieth Day
after we came in, having a fair Wind at <HI>N.</HI> and
<HI>N. N. W;</HI> and a fresh Gale, which held us five
Days without Intermission; in which Time, run∣ing
away <HI>S.</HI> and <HI>S. S. E.</HI> we reach'd the former
Latitude, where we had been; and meering
with nothing remarkable, we steer'd a little
farther to the <HI>Eastward;</HI> but keeping a <HI>Southerly,</HI>
Course still, 'till we came into the Latitude of
forty one; and then going due <HI>East,</HI> with the
<PB N="180" REF="183"/>
Wind at <HI>N.</HI> and by <HI>W.</HI> we reckon'd our Meridian
Distance from the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> to be fifty Degrees
and a half.</P>
<P>In all this Run we saw no Land, so we hall'd
two Points more <HI>Southerly</HI> and went on for six
or seven Days more; when one of our Men on
the round Top, cry'd Land. It was a clear fine
Morning, and the Land he spy'd, being very
high, it was found to be sixteen Leagues Di∣stance;
and the Wind slacking, we could not get
in that Night, so we lay by 'till Morning; when
being fair with the Land, we hoisted our Boat
to go and sound the Shore, as usual. They row'd
in close with the Shore, and found a little Cove;
where there was good riding, but very deep
Water; being no less than sixty Fathom within
Cables Length of the Shore.</P>
<P>We went in however, and after we were
moor'd, sent our Boat on Shore to look for
Water, and what else the Country afforded. Our
Men found Water, and a good Sort of Country,
but saw no Inhabitants; and upon coasting a
little both Ways on the Shore, they found it to
be an Island, and without People; but found
that about three Leagues off to the <HI>Southward,</HI>
there seem'd to be a <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> or Continent
of Land; where, it was more likely, we should
make some Discovery.</P>
<P>The next Day we fill'd Water again, and shot
some Ducks; and the Day after weigh'd, and
stood over for the Main, as we thought it to
be; here using the same Caution as we always
had done; (<HI>viz.</HI>) of sounding the Coast, we
found a bold Shore, and very good Anchor hold,
in six and twenty to thirty Fathom.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="184"/>
When we came on Shore here, we found
People, but of a quite different Condition, from
those we had met with before; being wild,
furious, and untractable, surpriz'd at the Sight
of us, but not frighted; preparing for Battle,
not for Trade; and no sooner were we on Shore,
but they saluted us with their Bows and Arrows.
We made Signals of Truce to them, but they
did not understand us; and we knew not what to
offer them more, but the Muzzles of our Mus∣quets;
for we were resolv'd to see, what Sort of
Folks they were, either by fair Means or foul.</P>
<P>The first Time therefore, that they shot at
our Men with their Bows and Arrows, we re∣turn'd
the Salute with our Musquet∣Ball,
and killed two of their best Archers. We could easily
perceive, that the Noise of our Pieces terrify'd
them; and the two Men being kill'd, they knew
not how, or with what, perfectly a stonish'd them;
of that they ran, as it were, clean out of the
Country; that is to say, clean out of our Reach;
for we could never set our Eyes upon any of
them after it. We coasted this Place also, accoding
to our usual Customs; and to our great
Surprize, found it was an Island too, tho' a large
one; and that the main Land lay still more to
the <HI>Southward,</HI> about six Leagues Distance; so
weresolv'd to look out farther, and accordingly
se tSail the next Day, and anchor'd under the
Shore of this last Land, which, we were persuaded,
was really the Main.</P>
<P>We went on Shore here peaceably, for we
neither saw any People, or the Appearance of
any; But a charming pleasant Valley, of about
ten or eleven Miles long, and five or six Miles
broad; and then it was surrounded with
<PB N="182" REF="185"/>
Mountains, which reach'd the full Length; run∣ing
parallel with the Valley, and closing it in
to the Sea at both Ends; so that it was a natural
Park; having the Sea on the <HI>North</HI> Side, and the
Mountains in a Semi-circle round all the rest of
it, These Hills were so high, and the Ways so
untrod and so steep, that our Men, who were
curious enough to have climb'd to the Top of
them, could find no Way, that was practicable
to get up; and so after two or three Attempts
gave it over.</P>
<P>In this Vale we found abundance of Deer, and
abundance of the same Kind of Sheep, which I
mention'd lately. We kill'd as many of both, as
we had Occasion for; and finding nothing here
worth our staying any longer for, except that
we saw smething like wild Rice growing here,
we weigh'd after three Days, and stood away still
to the <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>We had not sail'd above two Days with little
Wind, and an easy Sail, but we perceiv'd this
also was an Island, tho' it must be a large one;
for by our Account, we sail'd near a hundred and
fifty Miles along the Shore of it; and we found
the <HI>South</HI> Part, a flat pleasant Country enough;
and our Men said, they saw People upon it, on
the <HI>South</HI> Side; but we went not on Shore there
any more.</P>
<P>Steering due <HI>South</HI> from hence in Quest of the
mainLand, we went on eleven Days more, and saw
nothing significant; and upon a fair Observation,
I found, we were in the Latitude of seven
and forty Degrees and eight Minutes <HI>South;</HI> then
I alter'd my Course a little to the <HI>Eastward,</HI>
finding no Land, and the Weather very cold,
and going on with a fresh Gale at <HI>S. S. W.</HI> for four
<PB N="183" REF="186"/>
Days, We made Land again; but it was now to
the <HI>E. N. E.</HI> of that we were goten, as we may
say, beyond it.</P>
<P>We fell in with this Land in the Evening,
so that it was not perceiv'd till we was within
half a League of it, which very much alarm'd
us; the Land being low, and having found our
Error, we brought too, nnd stood off and on
till Morning, when we saw the Shore lie, as it
were, under our Larboard-bow, within a Mile
and a Quarter Distance; the Land low, but the Sea
deep and soft Ground. We came to an Anchor
immediately, and sent our Shallops to sound the
Shore, who found very good Riding in a little
Bay, under the Shelter of two Points of Land,
one of which made a kind of Hook, under
which we lay secure from all Winds that could
blow, in seventeen Fathom good Ground. Here
we had a good Observation, and found our selves
in the Latitude of fifty Degrees twenty one Mi∣nutes.
Our next Work was to find Water,
and our Boats going a-Shore, found Plenty of
good Water, and some Cattle; but told us they
could give no Account what they were, or what
they were like. In searching this Coast, we soon
found this was an Island also about eleven Leagues
in Length from <HI>N. W.</HI> to <HI>S. E.</HI> what Breadth we
could not tell. Our Men also, saw some Signs of
Inhabitants; the next Day six Men appear'd
at a Distance, but would take Notice of no
Signals, and fled as soon as our Men advanc'd.
Our People went up to the Place where they
lay, and found they had had a Fire of some dry
Wood; that they had lain there, as they sup∣pos'd,
all night, tho' without Covering; they
found two Pieces of old ragged Skins of Deer,
<PB N="184" REF="187"/>
which look'd as if worn out by some that had
used them for Cloathing; one Piece of a Skin o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
some other Creature which had been roll'd up in∣to
a Cap for the Head, and a Couple of Arrows
of about four Foot long, very thick, and made
of a hard and heavy Wood; so they must have
very large and strong Bows to shoot such Ar∣rows,
and consequently must be Men of an un∣common
Strength.</P>
<P>Our Men wandred about the Country here three
or four Days, with less Caution, than the Nature
of the Thing requir'd for they were not among
a People of an innocent inoffensive Temper here,
as before, but among a wild untractable Nation;
that perhaps had never seen Creatures in their
own Likeness before; and had no Thoughts of
themselves, but of being kill'd and destroy'd; and
consequently had no Thoughts of them they had
seen, but as of Enemies, whom they must either
destroy, if they were able, or escape from them,
if they were not. However, we got no Harm;
neither would the Natives ever appear, to accept
any Kindnesses from us.</P>
<P>We had no Business here, after we found what
Sort of People they were, who inhabited this
Place. So as soon as we had taken in fresh, Water,
and catch'd some Fish, of which we found good
Store, in the Harbour or Bay where we rode,
we prepar'd to be gone. Here we found the first
Oysters, that we saw any where in the <HI>South Seas;</HI>
and as our Men found them but the Day before
we were sail, they made great Intreaty to me,
to let them stay one Day to get a Quantity on
Board; they being very refreshing, as well as
nourishing to our Men.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="188"/>
But I was more easily prevail'd with to stay,
when Captain <HI>Merlotte brought</HI> me out of one
Oyster that he happen'd to open, a true Oriental
Pearl; so large and so fine, that I sold it, since
my return, for three and fifty Pound.</P>
<P>After taking this Oyster, I order'd all our
Boats out a dredging; and in two Days Time, so
great a Quantity there was, that our Men had
taken above fifty Bushels, most of them very
large. But we were surpriz'd, you may be sure,
when, at the opening all these Oysters, we found
not one Pearl, small nor great, of any Kind what∣ever;
so we concluded, that the other was a
lucky Hit only; and that perhaps there might
not be any more of that Kind in these Seas.</P>
<P>While we were musing on the Oddness of this
Accident, the Boatswain of the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship,
whose Boat's Crew had brougt in the great Oys∣ter,
in which the Pearl was found, and who had
been examining the Matter; came and told me,
That it was true, that their Boat had brought in
the Oyster; and that it was before they went
out a dredging in the offing; but that their
Boat took these Oysters on the <HI>West</HI> Side of the Island,
where they had been shoaring, as they call'd it;
that is to say, coasting along the Shore, to see if
they cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d find any Thing worth their Labour;
but that afterwards the Boat went a dredging
in the Mouth of the Bay where we rode; and
where finding good Store of Oysters, they had
gone no farther.</P>
<P>upon this Intelligence we order'd all Hands
to dredging again, on the <HI>West</HI> Side of the Island.
This was in a narrow Channel, between this
Island, and, a little Cluster of Islands; which we
we found together extended <HI>West,</HI> the Channel,
<PB N="186" REF="189"/>
where our Men fish'd, might be about a Leagn
over, something better; and the Water abou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive
to seven Fathom deep.</P>
<P>They came home well tir'd, and ill pleas'd
having taken nothing near so many Oysters, a
before. But I was much better pleas'd, when it
opening them, we found a hundred and
fifty eight Pearls, of the most perfect Colour
and of extraordinary Shape and Size; besides
double the Number of a less Size, and irregular
Shape.</P>
<P>This quicken'd our Diligence, and encourag'd
our Men; for I promis'd the Men two Peices of
Eight to each Man above his Pay, if I got any
considerable Quantity of Pearl. Upon this they
spread themseves among the Islands, and fish'd
for a whole Week; and I got such a Quantity of
Pearl, as made it very well worth our while;
and besides that, I had Reason to believe, the
Men, at least the Officers, who went with them,
conceal'd a considerable Quantity among them∣selves;
which, however, I did not think fit to
enquire very strictly after at that Time.</P>
<P>Had we been nearer home, and not at so very
great an Expence as three Ships, and so many
Men at Victuals and Wages; or had we been,
where we might have left one of our Vessels to
fish, and have come to them again; We would
not have given it over, while there had been an
Oyster left in the Sea; or at least, that we could
come at: But as Things stood, I resolv'd to give
it over, and put to Sea.</P>
<P>But when I was just giving Orders, Captain
<HI>Merlotte</HI> came to me, and told me, that all the
Officers in the three Ships had joyn'd together to
make an humble Petition to me; which was,
<PB N="187" REF="190"/>
that I would give them one Day to fish for them∣selves;
that the Men had promised, that if I
would consent, they would work for them <HI>Gra∣tis;</HI>
and they promis'd, if they gain'd any Thing
considerable, they would account for as much
out of their Wages, as should defray the Ships
Expence, Victuals, and Wages, for the Day.</P>
<P>This was so small a Request, that I readily
consented to it; and told them, I would give
them three Days, provided, they were willing to
give the Men a Largess, as I had done, in Pro∣portion
to their Gain. This they agreed to, and
to Work they went; but whether it was that
the Fellows work'd with a better Will, or that
the Officers gave them more Liquor, or that they
found a new Bank of Oysters, which had not
been found out before; But so it was, that the
Officers got as many Pearls, and some of extraor∣dinary
Size and Beauty, as they afterwards sold
when they came to <HI>Peru,</HI> for 3217 Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>When they had done this, I told them it was
but meet, that as they had made so good a Pur∣chase
for themselves by the Labour of the Men,
the Men shou'd have the Consideration which I
had proposed to them. But now I wou'd make
another Condition with them, That we would stay
three Days more, and what ever was Catch'd in
these three Days, shou'd be Share'd among the
Men at the first Port we came at, where they could be
Sold; that the Men who had now been out so long,
might have something to buy Clothes and Liquors,
without anticipating their Wages: But then I
made a Condition with the Men too, <HI>viz.</HI> that
what ever was taken, they shou'd Deposite it in
my Hands, and with the joynt Trust of three Men
of their own Choosing, one out of each Ship, and
<PB N="188" REF="191"/>
that we wou'd sell the Pearl, and I should divide the
Money among them equally, that so there might
be no Quarelling or Discontent, and that none of
them shou'd play any Part of it away: These
Engagements they all came willingly into, and
away they went a Dredging, Relieving one ano∣ther
punctually; so that in the whole three Days,
every Man Work'd an equal Share of Hours with
the rest.</P>
<P>But the poor Men had not so good Luck for
themselves, as they had for their Officers. How∣ever,
they got a considerable Quantity, and some
very fine ones; among the rest, they had Two, in
the exact Shape of a Pear, and very exactly
Match'd; and these they wou'd needs make me a
Present of, because I had been so kind to them,
to make the Proposal for them: I wou'd have
paid for them two hundred Pieces of Eight,
but One and All, they wou'd not be paid; and
wou'd certainly have been very much Affronted,
if I had not accepted of them; and yet the Success of
the Men was not so small, but join'd with the two
Pieces of Eight a Man, which I allowed them on
the Ships Account, and the like Allowance the
Officers made them, and the Produce of their
own Purchase they Divided afterwards, about
fifteen Pieces of Eight a Man, which was a great
Encouragement to them.</P>
<P>Thus we spent in the whole, near three Weeks
here, and called these the <HI>Pearl-Islands,</HI> tho' we
had given no Names to any Places before; we
were the more Surpriz'd with this Unexpected
Booty, because we all thought it very Unusual, to
find Pearl of so excellent a Kind in such a Latitude
as that of forty nine, to fifty; but it seems there
are Riches yet unknown in those Parts of the
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
World, where they have never been yet expected;
and I have been told, by those who pretend to
give a Reason for it, that if there was any Land
directly under the Poles, either <HI>South</HI> or <HI>North,</HI>
there wou'd be found Gold of a Fineness more than
Double to any that was ever yet found in the
World: And this is the Reason, they say, why
the Magnetick Influence, directs to the Poles, that
being the Center of the most pure Metals; and
why the Needle, toucht with the Load-Stone, or
Magnet, always points to the <HI>North</HI> or <HI>South</HI> Pole.
But I do not recommend this as a Certainty,
because, 'tis Evident, no Demonstration could
ever be arriv'd to, nor could any Creature reach
to that particular Spot of Land under the Pole,
if such there should be, those Lands being Sur∣rounded
with Mountains of Snow, and frozen
Seas which never Thaw, and are uterly Un∣passible,
either for Ships or Men.</P>
<P>But to return to our Voyage, having thus
spent, as I have said, three Weeks on this un∣expected
Expedition; we set Sail, and as I was
almost satisfied with the Discoveries we had made,
I was for bending my Course <HI>Due-East,</HI> and so
directly for the <HI>South</HI> part of <HI>America;</HI> but the
Winds now blowing fresh from the <HI>N. W.</HI> and
good Weather, I took the Occasion, as a Fa∣vourable
Summons, to keep still on <HI>Southing</HI> as well as
<HI>East,</HI> till we came into the Latitude of fifty six;
when our Men who had been all along, a Warm-Weather-Voyage,
began to be Pinch't very much
with the Cold, and particularly Complain'd, that
they had not Cloaths sufficient for it.</P>
<P>But they were brought to be Content by Force;
for the Wind continuing at <HI>N.</HI> and <HI>N. N. W.</HI> and
blowing very hard, we were oblig'd to keep onour
<PB N="190" REF="193"/>
Course farther <HI>South</HI> indeed, than I ever intended▪
and one of our Men swore we shou'd be driven to
the <HI>South</HI>-Pole; indeed, we rather ran afore it,
than kept our Course; and in this Run, we suf∣fered
the extreamest Cold, tho' a <HI>Northerly</HI> Wind
in those Latitudes is the warm Wind, as a <HI>Souther∣ly</HI>
is here; but it was attended with Rain and
Snow, and both Freezing Violently; at length,
One of our Men cry'd out Land, and our Men
began to rejoice; but I was quite of a differing
Opinion, and my Fears were but too just;
for as soon as ever he cry'd Land, and that I ask'd him
in what Quarter, and he answered <HI>Due South</HI> which
was almost right a Head, I bid wear the Ship, and put
her about immediately, not doubting, but instead
of Land, I shou'd find it a Mountain of Ice, and
so it was; and it was Happy for us that we had a
stout Ship under us, for it blew a Fret of Wind.
However, the Ship came very well about, tho'
when she fill'd again, we found the Ice not half a
League Distance under our Stern.</P>
<P>As I hapened to be the Head most Ship, I fir'd
two Guns to give Notice to our other Vessels, for
that was our Signal to come about, but that
which was very Uneasy to me, the Weather was
Hazy, and they were both out of Sight; which
was the first time that we lost Sight of one ano∣ther
in those Seas: However, being both to
Windward, and within Hearing of my Guns, they
took the Warning, and came about with more
Leasure, and less Hazard than I had done.</P>
<P>I stood away now to the <HI>Eastward,</HI> firing
Guns continually, that they might know which
Way to follow; and they answered me duly, to
let me know that they heard me.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="194"/>
It was our great good Hap also, that it was
Day when we escaped this Danger; in the After∣noon
the Wind abated, and the Weather clear'd
up: We then call'd a Council, and resolv'd to go no
farther <HI>S.</HI> being then in the Latitude of sixty
seven <HI>South,</HI> which I suppose, is the farthest
<HI>Southern</HI> Latitude that any <HI>European</HI> Ship ever saw
in those Seas.</P>
<P>That Night it froze extreamly hard, and the
Wind Veering to the <HI>S. W.</HI> it was the severest
Cold that ever I felt in my Life; a Barrel or
Cask of Water, which stood on the Deck, Froze
intirely in one Night, into one Lump, and our
Cooper, Knocking off the Hoops from the Cask,
took it to Pieces, and the Barrel of Ice stood by
it self, in the true Shape of the Vessel It had been
in. This Wind was however Favourable to our
Deliverance, for we stood away now <HI>N. E.</HI> and
<HI>N. E.</HI> by <HI>N.</HI> making fresh Way with a fair
Wind.</P>
<P>We made no more Land, till we came into
the Latitude of sixty two, when we saw some
Islands at a great Distance, on both Sides of us;
we believed them to be Islands, because we saw
many of them, with large Openings between.
But we were all so willing, to get into a warmer
Climate, that we did not incline to put in any
where, till having run thus fifteen Days, and the
Wind still holding <HI>Southerly</HI> with small Alteration
and clear Weather, We could easily perceive the
Climate alter'd, and the Weather grew Milder;
and here taking an Observation, I found my
self in the Latitude of Fifty and a Half, and that
our Meridian-Distance from the <HI>Ladrones West,</HI>
was eighty seven Degrees, being almost one
Sem-idiamiter of the Globe, so that I could not
<PB N="192" REF="195"/>
be far from the Coast of <HI>America,</HI> which was my
next Design, and indeed, the chief Design of the
whole Voyage.</P>
<P>On this Expectation, I chang'd my Course a
little, and went away <HI>N.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> till by an Obser∣vation,
I found my self in forty seven Degrees
seven Minutes, and then standing away <HI>East,</HI> for
about eleven Days more, we made the Tops of
the <HI>Andes</HI> the great Mountains of <HI>Chili</HI> in <HI>South-America</HI>
to our great Joy and Satisfaction, tho' at
a very great Distance.</P>
<P>We found our Distance from the Shore, not
less than twenty Leagues, the Mountains being
so very High, and our next Business was to Con∣sider,
what part of the <HI>Andes</HI> it must be, and to
what Port we shou'd Direct our selves first. Upon
the Whole, we found we were too much to the
<HI>South</HI> still, and resolved to make directly for the
River or Port of <HI>Valdivia</HI> or <HI>Baldivia,</HI> call it
which you please, in the Latitude of forty De∣grees;
so we stood away to the <HI>North:</HI> The next
Day this <HI>Pacifick quiet Sea,</HI> as they call'd it, shew'd
us a very frowning rough Countenance, and
prov'd the very Extreme of a contrary Disposition.
For it blew a Storm of Wind at <HI>E.</HI> by <HI>S.</HI> and
drove us off the Coast again, but it abated again
for a Day or two; and then for six Days together,
it blew excessive hard, almost all at <HI>East;</HI> so that
I found no possibility of getting into the Shore:
And besides, I found that the Winds came off that
Mountainous Country in Squals; and that the
nearer we came the Hills, the Gusts were the
more Violent: So I resolved to run for the Island
of <HI>Juan <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erandes</HI> to refresh our selves there until
the Weather was settled, and besides we wanted
fresh Water very much.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="196"/>
The little that the Wind stood <HI>Southerly</HI>
help'd me in this Run, and we came in five
Days more fair with the Island, to our great Joy,
and brought all our Ships to an Anchor as near
the watering Place as is usual, where we rode
easy, tho' the Wind continued to blow very hard;
and being, I say, now about the Middle of our
Voyage, I shall break off my Account here, as
of the first Part of my Work, and begin again
at our Departure from hence.</P>
<P>It is true, we had got over much the great∣er
Run, as to Length of Way; but the most
important Part of our Voyage was yet to come,
and we had no inconsiderable Length to run nei∣ther,
for as we purposed to sail <HI>North,</HI> the
Height of <HI>Panama,</HI> in the Latitude of nine De∣grees
<HI>N.</HI> and back again by Cape <HI>Horn,</HI> in the
Latitude of, perhaps, sixty Degrees <HI>South,</HI> and that
we were now in forty Degrees <HI>South;</HI> those three
added to the Run, from Cape <HI>Horn</HI> home to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
made a prodigious Length, as you will
see by this following Account; in which, also
the Meridian Distances are not at all reckoned,
tho' those also are very great.</P>

were, from the Meridian of <HI>England,</HI> whither

of <HI>Juan Fernandes.</HI></P>
<P>But to return a little to our Stay in this Place,
for that belongs to this Part of my Account, and
of which I must make a few short Observa∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="198"/>
It was scarce possible to restrain <HI>English</HI> Men,
after so long beating the Sea, from going on
Shore, when they came to such a Place of
Refreshment as this; nor indeed was it rea∣sonable
to restrain them, considering how we all
might be supposed to stand in need of Refresh∣ment;
and considering that here was no Length
of Ground for the Men to wander in, no Liquors
to come at to distract them with their Excess;
and, which was still more, no Women to disorder
or debauch them: We all knew their chief Ex∣ercise
would be Hunting Goats for their Subsist∣ance;
and we knew also, that, however they
wanted the Benefit of fresh Provision, they
must work hard to catch it, before they could
taste the Sweet of it. Upon these Considerations,
I say, our Ships being well moor'd, and
riding safe, we restrain'd none of them, except
a due Number to take Care of each Ship; and
those were taken out by Lot, and then had their
Turn also to go on Shore some Days after∣wards,
and, in the mean Time, had both fresh
Water and fresh Meat sent them immediately,
and that in sufficient Quantity, to their Satisfac∣tion.
As soon as we were on Shore, and had
look'd about us, we begun first with getting
some fresh Water, for we greatly wanted it, then
carrying a small C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sk of Arack on Shore, I
made a Quantity of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be put into a whole Butt
of Water before I let our Men drink a Drop;
so correcting little the Chilness of the Water,
because I knew they would drink an immoderate
Quantity, and endanger their Healths: And the
Effect answer'd my C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re; for those who drank
at the Spring, where they took in the Water,
before I got this Butt fill'd, and before the
<PB N="196" REF="199"/>
Arack was put into it, fell into Swoonings and
faint Sweats, having gorg'd themselves too
much with the cool Water; and two or three,
I thought, would have dy'd; but our Surgeons
took such Care of them, that they recover'd.</P>
<P>While this was doing, others cut down
Branches of Trees, and built us two large Booths,
and five or six smaller; and we made two Tents
with some old Sails: And thus we encamp'd, as
if we had been to take up our Dwelling, and in∣tended
to People the Island.</P>
<P>At the same Time, others of our Men began
to look out for Goats, for you may believe, we all
long'd for a little fresh Meat. They were a lit∣tle
too hasty at their Work at first; for firing a∣mong
the first Goats they came at, when there
was but a few Men together, they frighted the
Creatures, and they ran all away into Holes,
and among the Rocks and Places where we
could not find them: So that for that Day they
made little of it. However, sending for more
Fire-men, they made a Shift to bring in seven∣teen
Goats the same Day; whereof we sent five
on Board the Ships, and feasted with the rest on
Shore. But the next Day the Men went to work
in another Manner, and with better Conduct;
for as we had Hands enough, and Fire-arms e∣nough,
they spread themselves so far, that they,
as it were, surrounded the Creatures, and so
driving them out of their Fast nesses and Retreats,
they had no Occasion to shoot, for the Goats
could not get from them, and they took them e∣very
where with their Hands, except some of
the old He-goats, which were so surly, that
they would stand at Bay, and rise at them, and would
<PB N="197" REF="200"/>
not be taken; and these, as being old also, and
as they thought, good for nothing, they let go.</P>
<P>In short, so many of our Men went on Shore,
and these divided themselves into so many little
Parties, and ply'd their Work so hard, and had
such good Luck, that I told them, it look'd as if
they had made a general Massacre of the Goats,
rather than a Hunting.</P>
<P>Our Men also might be said, not to refresh
themselves, but to feast themselves here with
fresh Provisions; for, tho' we stay'd but thirteen
Days, yet we kill'd three hundred and seventy
Goats; and our Men who were on Board, were
very merrily employ'd, I assure you; for they
might be said to do very little but <HI>roast</HI> and <HI>stew,</HI>
and <HI>broil</HI> and <HI>fry</HI> from Morning to Night; it
was indeed an exceeding Supply to them, for
they had been extremely fatigu'd with the last
Part of their Voyage, and had had no fresh Pro∣visions
for six Weeks before.</P>
<P>This made them hunt the Goats with the
more Eagerness; and indeed, they surrounded
them so dexterously, and follow'd them so nim∣bly,
that notwithstanding the Difficulties of the
Rocks, yet the Goats could hardly ever es∣cape
them. Here our Men found also very good
Fish, and some few Tortoises, or Turtles, as the
Sea-men call them; but they valued them not,
when they had such Plenty of Venison: Also they
found some very good Herbs in the Island, which
they boil'd with the Goats Flesh, and which made
their Broth very savoury and comfortable, and
withal very Healing and good against the
Scurvy, which in those Climates <HI>English</HI> Men are
very subject to.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="201"/>
We were now come to the Month of <HI>April</HI>
1715, having spent almost eight Months in this
trafficking wandering Voyage, from <HI>Manilla</HI>
hither. And whoever shall follow the same, or
a like Track, if ever such a Thing shall happen,
will do well to make a Year of it, and may find it
very well worth while.</P>
<P>I doubt not, but there are many undiscover'd
Parts of Land to the <HI>West,</HI> and to the <HI>South</HI>
also; of the first Shore, of which I mention'd,
that we stay'd trafficking for little Bits of Gold.
And tho' it is true, that such a Traffick, as I
have given an Account of, is very advantageous
in it self, and worth while to look for; especi∣ally
after having had a good Market for an
outward bound <HI>European</HI> Cargo, according to the
Pattern of ours at the <HI>Phillipines;</HI> and which, by
the Way, they need not miss; I say, as this
Trade for Gold would be well worth while, so
had we gone the best Way, and taken a Course
more to the <HI>South</HI> from <HI>Manilla,</HI> not going away
<HI>E.</HI> to the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> we should certainly have
fallen in with a Country from the Coast of <HI>New
Guinea,</HI> where we might have found Plenty of
Spices, as well as of Gold.</P>
<P>For why should we not be allow'd to suppose,
that the Country on the same Continent, and
in the same Latitude, should produce the
same Growth? Especially considering them situ∣ated,
as it may be call'd, in the Neighbourhood
of one another.</P>
<P>Had we then proceeded this Way, no Que∣stion,
but we might have fixt on some Place for
a Settlement, either <HI>English</HI> or <HI>French;</HI> whence a
Correspondence being establish'd with <HI>Europe,</HI>
either by Cape <HI>Horn East,</HI> or the Cape <HI>De Bona
<PB N="199" REF="202"/>
Esperance West,</HI> as we had thought fit; they might
have found as great a Production of the Nutmegs,
and the Cloves, as at <HI>Banda,</HI> and <HI>Ternate;</HI> or
have made those Productions have been planted
there for the future, where, no doubt, they
would grow and thrive as well, as they do now
in the <HI>Molucco's.</HI></P>
<P>But we spun out too much Time for the
Business we did and tho' we might, as above,
discover new Places, and get very well too;
yet we did nothing, in Comparison of what we
might be suppos'd to do, had we made the
Discovery more our Business.</P>
<P>I cannot doubt also, but that when I stood
away <HI>South,</HI> it was too late; for had I stood
into the Latitude of sixty seven at first, as I did
afterwards, I have good Reason to believe, that
those Islands, which we call the <HI>Molucco's,</HI> and
which lie so thick, and for so great an Extent,
go on yet farther, and it is scarce to be imagin'd,
that they break off just with <HI>Gilloto.</HI></P>
<P>This I call a Mistake in me; namely, that I
stood away <HI>East</HI> from the <HI>Phillipines</HI> to the
<HI>Ladrones,</HI> before I had gone any Length to the
<HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to the Course set dawn in this
Work, namely, <HI>S. E.</HI> and by <HI>E.</HI> from the said
<HI>Ladrones,</HI> the Places I have taken Notice of, as
these, do not, in my Opinion, appear to be
inconsiderable, and of no Value; so had we
search'd farther into them, I doubt not, but
there are greater Things to be discover'd; and
perhaps, a much greater Extent of Land also.
For▪ as I have but just, as it were, describ'd
the Shell, having made no Search after the
Kernel; it is more than probable, that within
<PB N="200" REF="203"/>
the Country, there might be greater Discoveries
made, of immense Value▪ too. For even as I
observ'd several Times, whenever we found
any People that had Gold, and ask'd them, as
well as by Signs we could make them understand,
they always pointed to the Rivers, and the
Mountains, which lay farther up the Country,
and which we never made any Discovery of;
having little in our View, but the getting what
little Share of Gold, the poor People had about
them. Whereas had we taken a Possession of
the Place, and left a Number of Men sufficient
to support themselves, in making a farther
Search; I cannot doubt, but that there must
be a great deal of that, of which the unactive
<HI>Indians</HI> had gotten but a little.</P>
<P>Nor had we any skilful Man among us, to
view the Face of the Earth; and see what Trea∣sure
of choice Vegetables might be there. We had
indeed six very good Surgeons; and one of
them, who we took in among the <HI>Madagascar</HI>
Men, was a Man of very great Reading, and
Judgment; But he acknowledg'd, he had no
Skill in Botanicks, having never made it his
Study.</P>
<P>But, to tell the Truth, our <HI>Doctors</HI> themselves,
<HI>so we call the Surgeons at Sea,</HI> were so taken up in
the Traffick for Gold; that they had no Leisure
to think of any Thing else. They did indeed
pick up some Shells, and some strange figur'd
Skeletons of Fishes, and small Beasts, and other
Things, which they esteem'd as Rarities; But
they never went a Simpling, as we call it; or
to enquire, what the Earth brought forth that
was rare, and not to be found any where else.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="204"/>
I think likewise, 'tis worth observing, how
the People we met with, where, 'tis probable,
no Ships, much less <HI>European</HI> Ships, had ever
been; and where they had never convers'd with
Enemies, or with Nations accustomed to steal
and plunder; I say, the People, who liv'd thus,
had no Fire, no Rage in their Looks; no jealous
Fears of Strangers doing them Harm; and con∣sequently
no Desire to do Harm to others. They
had Bows and Arrows indeed, but it was rather
to kill the Deer and Fowls, and to provide
themselves Food, than to offend their Enemies;
for they had none.</P>
<P>When therefore removing from thence, we
came to other and different Nations, who were
ravenous and mischievous, treacherous and fierce;
we concluded, they had convers'd with other
Nations; either by going to them, or their
Vessels coming there. And to confirm me in
this Opinion, I found, these fierce false <HI>Indians</HI>
had <HI>Canoes</HI> and Boats; some of one Kind, and
some of another; by which perhaps, they con∣vers'd
with the Islands, or other Nations near
them; and that they also receiv'd Ships and
Vessels from other Nations; by which they had
several Occasions to be upon their Guard; and
learn'd the treacherous and cruel Part from
others; which Nature gave them no Ideas of
before.</P>
<P>As the Natives of these Places were tractable
and courteous, so they would be made easi∣ly
subservient and assistant to any <HI>European</HI>
Nation that would come to make Settlements
among them; especially, if those <HI>European</HI> Na∣tions
used them with Humanity and Courtesy;
for I have made it a general Observation con∣cerning
<PB N="202" REF="205"/>
the Natural Disposition of all the Sa∣vage
Nations that ever I met with: That if
they are once but really oblig'd, they will be
always very faithful.</P>
<P>But it is our People, I mean the <HI>Europeans,</HI>
breaking Faith with them, that first teaches them
Ingratitude; and inures them to treat their
new Comers with Breach of Faith, and with
Cruelty and Barbarity. If you once win
them by Kindness, and doing them good, I
mean at first, before they are taught to be
Rogues by Example, they will generally be
honest, and be kind also to the uttermost of
their Power.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd, that it has been the
Opinion of all the Sailors, who have navigated
those Parts of the World, that farther <HI>South</HI>
there has been great Tracts of undiscover'd
Land; and some have told us, they have seen
them, and have call'd them by such and such
Names; as particularly the Isles of <HI>Solomon,</HI> of
which yet, we can read of no Body that ever
went on Shore on them, or that could give
any Account of them; except such as are Ro∣mantick,
and not to be depended upon.</P>
<P>But what has been the Reason why we
have hitherto had nothing but Guesses made
at those Things, and that all that has been
said of such Lands, has been imperfect? The
Reason, if I may speak my Opinion, has been,
because it is such a prodigious Run from the
Coast of <HI>America</HI> to the Islands of the <HI>Ladrones,</HI>
that the few People who have perform'd it,
never durst venture to go out of the Way of
the Trade Winds, lest they should not be
able to subsist for wane of Water and Provi∣sions;
<PB N="203" REF="206"/>
and this is particularly the Case in the
Voyage from the Coast of <HI>America</HI> only.</P>
<P>Whereas, to go the Way which I have
mark'd out, had we seen a Necessity, and
that there was no Land to be found to the
<HI>South</HI> of the Tropick, for a Supply of Provi∣sions
and fresh Water, it was evident we
could have gone back again from one Place to
another, and have been constantly supplied;
and this makes it certain also, that it cannot be
reasonably undertaken by a Ship going from
the <HI>East,</HI> I mean the Coast of <HI>America,</HI> to the
<HI>West:</HI> But from the <HI>West,</HI> viz. the Spice Islands,
to <HI>America West,</HI> it may be adventured with
Ease, as you see.</P>
<P>It is true, That <HI>William Cornelius Van Schouton</HI>
and <HI>Francis la Mair,</HI> who first found the Passage
into the <HI>South-Sea</HI> by Cape <HI>Horn,</HI> and not to
pass the Streights of <HI>Magellan;</HI> I say, they did
keep to the <HI>Southward</HI> of the Tropick, and pass,
in Part, the same Way I have here given an
Account of, as by their Journals, which I have
by me at this Time, is apparent.</P>
<P>And it is as true also, that they did meet
with many Islands and unknown Shores in
those Seas, where they got Refreshment, espe∣cially
fresh Water: Perhaps some of the Places
were the same I have describ'd in this Voyage;
but why they never pursued that Discovery,
or mark'd those Islands and Places they got
Refreshments at, so that others, in quest of
Business, might have touch'd at them, and have
receiv'd the like Benefit, that I can give no
Account of.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="207"/>
I cannot help being of Opinion, let our Map-makers
place them where they will, that those
Islands, where we so successfully fish'd for Oy∣sters,
or rather for Pearl, are the same which
the ancient Geographers have call'd <HI>Solomon</HI>'s
Islands; and tho' they are so far <HI>South,</HI> the
Riches of them may not be the less; nor
are they more out of the Way. On the
contrary, they lie directly in the Track which
our Navigators would take, if they thought fit
either to go or come between <HI>Europe</HI> and the
<HI>East-Indies,</HI> seeing they that come about Cape
<HI>Horn,</HI> seldom go less <HI>South</HI> than the Latitude
of sixty three to sixty four Degrees; and these
Islands, as I have said, lie in the Latitude of
Forty to Forty Eight <HI>South,</HI> and extend them∣selves
near one hundred and sixty Leagues in
Breadth from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>Without doubt, those islands would make a
very noble Settlement, in Order to victual
and relieve the <HI>European</HI> Merchants, in so
long a Run as they have to make; and when
this Trade came to be more frequented, the
Calling of those Ships there would enrich the
Islands, as the <HI>English</HI> at St. <HI>Hellena</HI> are enriched
by the refreshing which the <HI>East-India</HI> Ships
find, that meet there.</P>
<P>But to return to our present Situation, at
St. <HI>Juan Fernando;</HI> the Refreshment which our
Men found here, greatly encourag'd and re∣viv'd
them; and the Broths and Stewings
which we made of the Goats Flesh which we
kill'd there, than which, nothing could be
wholesomer, restored all our sick Men; so that
we lost but two Men in our whole Passage
from the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> and had lost but eight
<PB N="205" REF="208"/>
Men in our whole Voyage from <HI>England,</HI> ex∣cept
I should reckon those five Men and a Boy
to be lost, which ran away from us in the
Country among the <HI>Indians,</HI> as I have already
related.</P>
<P>I should have added, that we careen'd and
clean'd our Ships here, and put our selves into a
Posture for whatever Adventures might happen;
for, as I resolved upon a Trading Voyage upon
the Coast of <HI>Chill</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and a Cruising Voyage
also, as it might happen; so, I resolved also, to
put our Ships into a Condition for both, as Oc∣casion
should present.</P>
<P>Our Men were nimble, at this Work especial∣ly,
having been so well refreshed and heart'ned
up, by their extraordinary Supply of fresh Meats,
and the Additions of good Broths and Soops,
which they fed on every Day in the Island, and
with which, they were supplied without any Man∣ner
of Limitation, all the while they were at work.</P>
<P>This, I say, being their Case, they got the <HI>Ma∣dagascar</HI>
Ship hall'd down, and her Bottom wash'd
and tallow'd, and she was as clean as when she
first came off of the Stocks, in five Days Time;
and she was rigg'd, and all set to rights, and fit
for Sailing in two more.</P>
<P>The great Ship was not so soon fitted, nor was
I in so much Haste, for I had a Design in my
Head, which I had not yet communicated to any
Body, and that was to send the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship
a Cruising, as soon as she was fitted up: Accor∣dingly,
I say, the fifth Day she was ready, and I
managed it so, that the Captain of the <HI>Madagascar</HI>
Ship, openly, before all the Men, made the
Motion, as if it had been his own Project, and
<PB N="206" REF="209"/>
desired I would let him go and try his Fortune
as he call'd it.</P>
<P>I seemed loth at first, but he added to his Im∣portunity,
that he and all his Crew were willing
if they made any Purchase, it should be divided
among all the Crews, in Shares, according as they
were shipped; that if it was Provisions the Cap∣tain
should buy it at half Price, for the Use of the
whole, and the Money to be shared.</P>
<P>Well, upon hearing his Proposals, which were
esteemed very just, and the Men all agreeing, I
seemed to consent, and so he had my Orders and
Instructions, and Leave to be out twelve Days on
his Cruise, and away he went; his Ship was an
excellent Sailor, as has been said, and being now
a very clean Ship, I thought he might speak with
any Thing, or get away from any Thing, if he
pleased; by the Way, I ordered him to put out
none but <HI>French</HI> Colours.</P>
<P>He cruised a Week without seeing a Sail, and
stood in quite to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Shore in one Place,
but that he was wrong in; the eighth Day, giv∣ing
over all Expectations, he stood off again to
Sea, and the next Morning he spy'd a Sail, which
was a large <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship, and which seemed to
stand down directly upon him, which a little
check'd his Forwardness; however, he kept on
his Course, when the <HI>Spaniard</HI> seeing him plainer,
than, it seems, he had done at first, tack'd, and
crouding all the Sail he could carry, stood in for
the Shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> was a good Sailor, but our Ship
plainly gained upon her, and in the Evening came
almost up with her; when he saw the Land, tho'
at a great Distance, and he was loth to be seen,
chaceing her, from the Shore; however, he fol∣lowed,
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>
and Night coming on, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> chang'd
his Course, thinking to get away, but as the Moon
was just rising, our Men, who resolved to keep her
in Sight, if possible, perceived her, and stretch'd
after her with all the Canvas they could lay on.</P>
<P>This Chase held till about Midnight, when our
Ship coming up with her, took her, after a little
Dispute; they pretended, at first, to have nothing
on Board but Timber, which they were carrying,
as they said, to some Port for the building of
Ships: But our Men had the Secret to make the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> confess their Treasure, if they had any;
so, that after some hard Words with the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Commander, he confessed he had some Money on
Board, which on our Mens Promise of good
Usage, he afterwards very honestly delivered,
and which might amount to obout sixteen Thou∣sand
Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>But he had what we were very glad of besides,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) about two hundred great Jars of very good
Wheat Flower, a large Quantity of Oil, and some
Casks of Sweet-Meats, all which was to us very
good Prize.</P>
<P>But now our Difficulty was, what we should do
with the Ship, and with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and this
was so real a Difficulty, that I began often to wish
he had not taken her, least her being let go, she
should alarm the Country, or if detained, disco∣ver
us all.</P>
<P>It was not above one Day beyond his Orders,
that we had the Pleasure of seeing him come into
the Road, with his Prize in tow, and the Flower
and Oil was a very good Booty to us; but upon
second and better Thoughts, we brought the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to a fair Treaty, and, which was more
difficult, brought all our Men to consent to it.
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>
The Case is this, knowing what I proposed to my
self to do, namely, to trade all the Way up the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Coast, and to pass for <HI>French</HI> Ships, I knew
the taking this <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship would betray us all,
unless I resolved to sink the Ship and murther all
the Men, so I came to this Resolution, namely,
to talk with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain, and make Terms
with him, which I soon made him very glad of.</P>
<P>First I pretended to be very angry with the
Captain of the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship, and to have put
him under Confinement, for having made a Prize
of his Catholick Majesty's Subjects, we being Sub∣jects
to the King of <HI>France,</HI> who was in perfect
Peace with the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Then I told him, that I would restore him his
Ship and all his Money, and as to his Flower and
Oil, which the Men had fallen greedily upon,
having a Want of it, I would pay him the full Va∣lne
in Money for it all, and for any other Loss he
had sustained, only that I would oblige him to lie
in the Road at the Island where we were, till we
returned from our Voyage to <HI>Lima,</HI> whether we
were going to trade, for which lying, I also a∣greed
to pay him Demorage for his Ship, after the
Rate of eight hundred Pieces of Eight <HI>per</HI> Month,
and if I returned not in four Months, he was to
be at his Liberty to go.</P>
<P>The Captain, who thought himself a Prisoner
and undone, you may besure, would embrace this
Offer; and so we secured his Ship till our Return,
and there we found him very honestly at an An∣chor,
of which in its Place.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E were now, as I have said, much
about the Middle of our Voyage,
at least as I had intended it, and
having stor'd ourselves with every
thing the Place afforded, we got
ready to proceed, for we had, as it were,
dwelt here near a Fortnight.</P>
<P>By this Time the Weather was good again,
and we stood away to the <HI>S. E.</HI> for the Port
of <HI>Baldivia,</HI> as above, and reach'd to the
Mouth of the Harbour in Twelve Days Sail.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="213"/>
I was now to change Faces again, and
Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> appear'd as Captain, al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Things being transacted in his Name, and
<HI>French</HI> Captains were put into the <HI>Brigantine</HI>
and into the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship also: The first
Thing the Captain did, was to send a civil
Message to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governor, to acquaint
him, That being come into those Seas as
Friends, under his most Christian Majesty's
Commission, and with the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s
Permission, we desir'd to be treated as Allies,
and to be allowed to take Water and Wood,
and to buy such Refreshments as we wanted,
for which we would pay ready Money; also
we carry'd <HI>French</HI> Colours, but took not the
least Notice of our Intention to trade with
them.</P>
<P>We received a very civil Answer from
the Governor (<HI>viz.</HI>) That being the King of
<HI>France</HI>'s Subjects, and that they were in Alli∣ance
with us, we were very welcome to Wood
and Water, and any Provision the Place
would afford; and that our Persons should
be safe, and in perfect Liberty to go on Shore,
but that he could not allow any of our Men
to lie on Shore., it being express in his Orders,
That he should not permit any Nation, not
actually in Commission from the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> to come on Shore, and stay there, no
not one Night; and that this was done to
prevent Disorders</P>
<P>We answered, That we were content with
that Order, seeing we did not desire our
Men should go on Shore to stay there, we not
<PB N="3" REF="214"/>
being able to answer for any Mis-behaviour,
which was frequent among Seamen.</P>
<P>While we continued here, several <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
came on Board and visited us, and
we often went on Shore on the same Pre∣tence;
but our Supra-Cargo, who under∣stood
his Business too well nor to make
use of the Occasion, presently let the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s
see, that he had a great Cargo of Goods to
dispose of; they as freely took the Hint, and
let him know, that they had Money enough
to pay for whatever they bought; so they
fell to work, and they bought <HI>East India</HI> and
<HI>China</HI> Silks, <HI>Japan</HI> Ware, <HI>China</HI> Ware, Spice,
and something of every thing we had. We
knew we should not sell all our Cargo here,
nor any extraordinary Quantity; but we
knew, on the other Hand, that what we did
sell here, we should sell for One hundred
Pounds <HI>per Cent,</HI> extraordinary: I mean,
more than we should sell for at <HI>Lima,</HI> or any
other Ports on that Side, and so we did; for
here we sold a Bottle of Arrack for Four
Pieces of eight; a Pound of Cloves for Five
Pieces of Eight, and a Pound of Nutmegs for
Six Pieces of Eight; and the like of other
Things.</P>
<P>They would gladly have purchas'd some
<HI>European</HI> Goods, and especially <HI>English</HI> Cloth
and Bays But as we had, indeed, very few
such Things left, so we were not willing
they should see them, that they might not
have any Suspicion of our being <HI>English</HI> Men,
and <HI>English</HI> Ships, which would soon have
put an End to all our Commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="215"/>
While we lay here trafficking with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
I set some of my Men to work,
to converse among the Native <HI>Chilians</HI> or <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
as we call them, of the Country, and
several things they learn'd of them according
to the Instructions which I gave them; for
Example; First, I understood by them, That
the Country People who do not live among
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> have a mortal Aversion to them;
that it is riveted in their Minds by Tradi∣tion,
from Father to Son, ever since the
Wars which had formerly been among them;
and that though they did not now carry on
those Wars, yet the Animosity remained, and
the Pride and cruel haughty Temper of
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was such still to those of the
Country People, who came under their Go∣vernment,
as makes that Aversion continu∣ally
increase. They let us know, That if
any Nation in the World would but come
in, and assist them against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and
support them in their Rising against them,
they would soon rid their Hands of the whole
Nation. This was to the Purpose, exactly,
as to what I wanted to know.</P>
<P>I then ordered particular Enquiry to be
made, Whether the Mountains of <HI>Andes</HI>
(which are, indeed, prodigious to look at,
and so frightful for their Height, that 'tis
not to be thought of without some Horror)
were in any Places passable? what Country
there was beyond them? and whether any of
their People had gone over and knew the
Passage?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="216"/>
The <HI>Indians</HI> concurr'd with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in this (for our Men enquir'd of both) That
though the <HI>Andes</HI> were to be supposed, indeed,
to be the highest Mountains in the World,
and that, generally speaking, they were un∣passable,
yet that there had been Passages
found by the Vales among the Mountains;
where, with fetching several Compasses and
Windings, partly on the Hills, and partly
in the Valley<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Men went, with a great deal
of Ease and Safety, quite through or over, call
it as we will, to the other called the <HI>East-side,</HI>
and as often returned again.</P>
<P>Some of the more knowing <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Chi∣lians</HI>
went farther than this, and when our
Men enquired after the Manner, Situation
and Produce of the Country on the other
Side, they told them, That when they pass'd
the Mountains from that Part of the Coun∣try,
they went chiefly to fetch Cattle, and
kill Deer, of which there were great Num∣bers
in that Part of the Land; But that
when they went from St. <HI>Jago,</HI> they turned
away <HI>North</HI> some Leagues, when they came
to a Town called St. <HI>Anthonio de los Vejos,</HI> or,
The Town of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> and the old Men;
That there was a great River at that City,
from whence they found Means to go down
to the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> and so to the <HI>Buenos
Ayres;</HI> and that they frequently carried thi∣ther
great Sums of Money in <HI>Chilian</HI> Gold,
and brought back <HI>European</HI> Goods from
thence.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="217"/>
I had all I wanted now, and bad my
Men say no more to them of that, only tell
them, That they would come back, and
would travel a little that Way to see the
Country: The People appeared very well
pleased with that, assuring them, That if
they would do so, they should find some,
as well <HI>Spaniards</HI> as <HI>Chilians,</HI> who would be
Guides to them thro' the Hills; also assuring
them, That they would find the Hills very
practicable, and the People, as they went
along, very ready to assist and furnish them
with whatever they found they wanted, espe∣cially
if they come to know that they were
not <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or that they would protect
them from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which would be
the most agreeable Thing to them in the
World; for it seems many of the Nations of
the <HI>Chilians,</HI> had been driven to live in the
Hills, and some even beyond them, to avoid
the Cruelty and Tyranny of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
especially in the Beginning of their planting
in that Country.</P>
<P>The next Enquiry I ordered them to make,
was, Whether it was possible to pass those
Hills with Horses, or Mules, or any kind of
Carriages? and they assured them, They
might travel with Mules, and even with
Horses also, but rather with Mules; but as
to Carriages, such as Carts, or Waggons,
they allowed, that was not practicable. They
assured us, That some of those Ways thro'
the Hills were much frequented; and that
there were Towns, or Villages rather, of Peo∣ple,
to be found in the Valleys between
<PB N="7" REF="218"/>
the said Hills; some of which Villages,
were very large, and the Soil very rich and
fruitful, bearing sufficient Provisions for the
Inhabitants, who were very numerous. They
told us, The People were not much inclin'd
to live in Towns as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do, but
that they liv'd scatter'd up and down the
Country, as they were guided by the Good∣ness
of the Land; that they liv'd very secure
and unguarded, never offering any injury to
one another, nor fearing injury from any, but
the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>I caus'd these Enquiries to be made with
the utmost Prudence and Caution, so that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> had not the least Suspicion of our
Design; and thus having finished our Traf∣fick,
and taken in Water and Provisions, we
sailed from <HI>Baldivia,</HI> having settled a little
Correspondence there with <HI>Two Spaniards,</HI>
who were very faithful to us; and with
Two <HI>Chilian Indians,</HI> who we had, in a par∣ticular
Manner, engaged, and who, to make
sure of, we took along with us; and hav∣ing
spent about Thirteen Days here, and taken
the Value of about Six thousand Pieces of
Eight in Silver or Gold, but most of it in
Gold, we set Sail.</P>
<P>Our next Port was the Bay of the <HI>Con∣ception:</HI>
Here, having Two or Three Men on
Board, who were well acquainted with the
Coast, we run boldly into the Bay, and
came to an Anchor in that which they call
the Bite, or little Bay, under the Island <HI>Qui∣riquina;</HI>
and from thence we sent our Boat,
with <HI>French</HI> Mariners to row, and a <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="219"/>
Coxon, with a Letter to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gover∣nor,
from Captain <HI>Merlote.</HI> Our Pretence
was always the same as before, That we had
his most Christian Majesty's Commisson, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and that we desired Liberty to Wood and
Water, and to buy Provisions, having been a
very long Voyage, and the like.</P>
<P>Under those Pretences, we lay here about
Ten Days, and drove a very considerable
Trade for such Goods as we were sure they
wanted; and having taken about the Value
of Eight thousand Pieces of Eight, we set Sail
for the Port or River that goes up to St. <HI>Jago,</HI>
where we expected a very good Market, be∣ing
distant from the <HI>Conception</HI> about Sixty-five
Leagues.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Jago</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Chily,</HI> and
stands Twelve Leagues within the Land;
there are Two Ports, which are made use
of to carry on the Traffick of this Place,
<HI>viz. R. de Ropocalmo,</HI> and Port <HI>de Valpariso.</HI>
We were bound to the last, as being the only
Port for Ships of Burthen, and where there
is Security from bad Weather.</P>
<P>We found means here, without going up to
the City of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> to have Merchants
enough to come down to us; for this being a
very rich City, and full of Money, we
found all our valuable Silks of <HI>China,</HI> our
<HI>Atlas's, China</HI> Damasks, Satins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were
very much valued, and very much wanted,
and no Price was too high for us to ask for
them; for in a Word, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ladies,
who, for Pride, do not come behind any in
the World, whatever they do for Beauty,
<PB N="9" REF="220"/>
were so eager for those fine Things, that,
almost, any reasonable Quantity might have
been sold there; but the Truth is, We had an
unreasonable Quantity, and therefore, as we
had other Markets to go to, we did not let
them know what a great Stock o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Goods we
had, but took care they had something of
every thing they wanted: We likewise found
our Spices were an excellent Commodity in
those Parts, and fold for a monstrous Profit
too, as, indeed, every thing else did also, as
above.</P>
<P>We found it very easy to sell here to the Va∣lue
of One hundred and thirty thousand Pieces
of Eight, in all sorts of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>East-India</HI>
Goods; for still, though we had some of the
<HI>English</HI> Cargo loose, we let none of it be seen,
We took most of the Money in Gold un∣coin'd,
which they get out of the Moun∣tains
in great Quantities, and of which we
shall have Occasion to speak more hereafter.</P>
<P>Our next trading Port was <HI>Coquimbo,</HI> a
small Town, but a good Port; Here we went
in without Ceremony, and upon the same
Foot, of being <HI>French,</HI> were well received,
traded underhand with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchants,
and got Letters to some other Merchants at
<HI>Guasco,</HI> a Port in a little Bay about Fifteen
Leagues <HI>North</HI> from <HI>Coquimbo.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, to the Port of <HI>Copiapo,</HI> is
Twenty-five Leagues: Here we found very
good Port, though no trading Town or City;
but the Country being well inhabited, we
found Means to acquaint some of the princi∣pal
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Country, of what we
<PB N="10" REF="221"/>
were, and (with which they were pleased well
enough) That they might trade with us
for such Things, which it was easy to see,
they gave double Price for to the Merchants
who came from <HI>Lima,</HI> and other Places: This
brought them to us with so much Eagerness,
that though they bought for their own Use,
not for Sale, yet they came furnished with
Orders, perhaps, for Two or Three Families
together, and being generally rich, would
frequently lay out Six hundred, or Eight;
hundred Pieces of Eight a Man so that we
had a most excellent Market here, and took
above Thirty thousand Pieces of Eight that
is to say, The Value of it, for they still
paid all in Gold.</P>
<P>Here we had Opportunity to get a Quan∣tity
of good Flower, or Wheat Meal, of very
good <HI>European</HI> Wheat; that is to say, Of
that sort of Wheat; and withal, had good
Bisket baked on Shore, so that now we got a
large Recruit of Bread, and our Men began to
make Puddings, and liv'd very comfortably;
likewise we got good Sugar at the Ingenioes,
or Sugar-Mills, of which there were several
here, and the farther <HI>North</HI> we went, their
Number increased, for we were now in the
Latitude of Twenty-eight Degrees Two Min.
<HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>We had but one Port now, of any Conse∣quence,
that we intended to touch at, 'till
we came to the main Place we aim'd at,
which was <HI>Lima,</HI> and this was about Two
thirds of the Way thither I mean <HI>Porto Rica,</HI>
or <HI>Arica;</HI> this was in the Latitude of Eigh∣teen
<PB N="11" REF="222"/>
Degrees, or thereabouts: They were very
shy of us here, as having been much upon
their Guard for some Years past, for fear
of <HI>Buccaniers,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Privateers; but
when they understood we were <HI>French,</HI> and
our French Captain sent Two Recommenda∣tions
to them from a Merchant at St. <HI>Jago,</HI>
they were then very well satisfy'd, and we
had full Freedom of Commerce here also.</P>
<P>From hence we came the highth of <HI>Lima,</HI> the
Capital Port, if not the Capital City, of <HI>Peru,</HI> ly∣ing
in the Latitude of Twelve Degrees Thirty
Minutes. Had we made the least Pretence
of trading here, we should, at least, have had
Soldiers put on Board our Ships to have
prevented it, and the People would have
been forbidden to trade with us upon Pain
of Death; but Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> having
brought Letters to a principal Merchant of
<HI>Lima,</HI> he instructed him how to manage
himself at his first coming into the Port;
which was to ride without the Town of <HI>Callao,</HI>
out of the Command of the Puntals or Castles
there, and not to come any nearer, upon
what Occasion soever, and then to leave the
rest to him.</P>
<P>Upon this the Merchant applied himself
to the Governor for leave to go on Board
the <HI>French</HI> Ship at <HI>Callao;</HI> the Governor under∣stood
him, and would not grant it by any
means; the Reason was, Because there had
been such a general Complaint by the Mer∣chants
from <HI>Chartagena, Porto Bello,</HI> and other
Places, of the great Trade carried on here
with <HI>French</HI> Ships from <HI>Europe,</HI> to the Destru∣ction
<PB N="12" REF="223"/>
of the Merchants, and to the Ruin
of the Trade of the Galleons, that the Go∣vernor,
or Viceroy of <HI>Peru,</HI> had forbid the
<HI>French</HI> Ships landing any Goods.</P>
<P>Now, though this made our Traffick im∣practicable
at <HI>Lima</HI> itself, yet it did, by no
Means, hinder the Merchants trading with
us under Cover, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but especially when they
came to understand, that we were not loaden
from <HI>Europe,</HI> with Bays, long Ells, Druggets,
broad Cloth, Serges, Stuffs, Stockings, Hats,
and such like Woollen Manufactures of
<HI>France, England, &amp;c.</HI> but that our Cargo was
the same with that of the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ships at
<HI>Acapulco;</HI> and that we were loaden with <HI>Calli∣coes,</HI>
Muslins, fine wrought <HI>China</HI> Silks, Da∣masks,
<HI>Japan</HI> Ware, <HI>China</HI> Ware, Spices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
there was then no with-holding them, but
they came on Board us in the Night with
Canoes, and staying all Day, went on Shore
again in the Night, carrying their Goods to
different Places, where they knew they could
convey them on Shore without Difficulty.</P>
<P>In this Manner we traded publickly
enough, not much unlike the Manner of our
Trade at the <HI>Manillaes;</HI> and here we effe∣ctually
clear'd ourselves of our whole Cargo,
as well <HI>English</HI> Goods, as <HI>Indian,</HI> to an im∣mense
Sum. Here our Men, Officers as well
as Seamen, sold their fine Pearl, particularly
one large Parcel, containing One hundred
Seventy-three very fine Pearls, but of differ∣ent
Sizes, which a Priest bought, <HI>as we were
told,</HI> to dress up the Image of the blessed Vir∣gin
<HI>Mary,</HI> in one of their Churches.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="224"/>
In a Word, We came to a Ballance here;
for we sold every thing, that we had the least
Intention to part with, the chief things we kept
in Reserve were, some Bales of English Goods;
also all the Remainder of our Beads and
Bugles, Toys, Iron-work, Knives, Scizars,
Hatchets, Needles, Pins, Glass Ware, and
such Things as we knew the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did
not regard, and which might be useful in our
farther Designs, of which my Head was still
very full. Those, I say, We kept still.</P>
<P>Here, likewise, we sold our <HI>Brigantine,</HI>
which, though an excellent Sea-boat, as may well
be suppos'd, considering the long Voyage
we had made in her, was yet so Worm-eaten
in▪ her Bottom, that unless we would have
new sheath'd her, and, perhaps, shifted most
of her Planks too, which would have taken
up a great deal of Time; she was, by no
Means, fit to have gone any further, at least,
not so long a Run as we had now to make,
(<HI>viz</HI>) round the whole <HI>Southern</HI> Part of
<HI>America;</HI> I and where we should find no Port
to put in at (I mean, Where we should have
been able to have got any thing done for the
Repair of a Ship) 'till we had come home to
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It was proposed here, To have gone to
the Governor or Viceroy of <HI>Peru,</HI> and have
obtained his License or Pass, to have travers'd
the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> from Port St. <HI>Maria,</HI>
to the River of <HI>Darien;</HI> this we could easily
have obtain'd under the Character that we
then bore (<HI>viz.</HI>) of having the King of
<HI>France</HI>'s Commission, and had we been really
<PB N="14" REF="225"/>
all <HI>French,</HI> I believe I should have done it; but
as we were so many English Men, and as such
were then at open War with <HI>Spain,</HI> I did
not think it a safe Adventure, I mean, not
a rational Adventure, especially considering
what a considerable Treasure we had with
us.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, As we were now a
strong Body of able Sea-men, and had Two
stout Ships under us, we had no Reason to
apprehend either the Toil or the Danger of
a Voyage round <HI>Cape Horn,</HI> after which, we
should be in a very good Condition to make
the rest of our Voyage to <HI>England;</HI> whereas,
if we travell'd over the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> we
should be all like a Company of Freebooters,
and Buccaneers, loose and unshipp'd, and
should, perhaps, run some one Way, and
some another, among the Log-wood Cutters
at the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and other Places,
to get Passage, some to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and some to
<HI>New England;</HI> and, which was worse than
all, should be exposed to a Thousand Dan∣gers
on Account of the Treasure we had
with us, perhaps, even to that of murthering
and robbing one another; and, as Captain
<HI>Merlote</HI> said, who was really a <HI>French</HI> Man▪
It were much more eligible for us, as <HI>French,</HI>
or if we had been such, to have gone up to
<HI>Acapulco,</HI> and there to sell our Ships, and get
License to travel to <HI>Mexico,</HI> and then to have
got the Viceroy's <HI>Assiento,</HI> to have come to <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
in the Galleons; but as we were so many
<HI>Englishmen,</HI> it was impracticable; our Seamen
also being Protestants, <HI>such as Seamen gene∣rally
<PB N="15" REF="226"/>
are,</HI> and bold mad Fellows, they would
never have carry'd on a Disguise, both of
their Nation, and of their Religion, for so
long a Time as it would have been necessary
to do for such a Journey and Voyage.</P>
<P>But besides all these Difficulties, I had
other Projects in my Head, which made me
against all the Proposals of passing by Land
to the <HI>North-Sea;</HI> otherwise, had I resolved
it, I should not have much concern'd myself
about obtaining a License from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
for, as we were a sufficient Number of Men
to have forced our Way, we should not much
have stood upon their giving us leave, or not
giving us leave, to go.</P>
<P>But, as I have said, my Views lay another
Way, and my Head had been long working
upon the Discourse my Men had had with the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Baldivia;</HI> I frequently talk'd
with the Two <HI>Chilian Indians</HI> which I had
on Board, and who spoke <HI>Spanish</HI> pretty well,
and who we had taught to speak a little
<HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>I had taken care that they should have all
the good Usage imaginable on Board; I had
given them each a very good Suit of Cloaths,
made by our Taylor, but after their own
Manner, with each of them a Bays Cloak;
and had given them Hats, Shoes, Stockings,
and every thing they desir'd, and they were
mighty well pleas'd, and I talk▪ d very freely
with them about the Passage of the Mountains,
for that was now my grand Design.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="227"/>
While I was coming up the <HI>Chilian</HI> Shore,
as you have heard, that is to say, At St. <HI>Jago,</HI>
at the <HI>Conception,</HI> at <HI>Arica,</HI> and even at <HI>Lima</HI>
itself, we enquir'd, on all Occasions, into the
Situation of the Country, the Manner of tra∣velling,
and what kind of Country it was be∣yond
the Mountains? and we found them all
agreeing in the same Story; and that passing
the Mountains of <HI>Les Cordelieras,</HI> for <HI>so they
call them in</HI> Peru, <HI>though it was the same Ridge
of Hills as we call the</HI> Andes, was no strange
Thing; that there were not One or Two, but
a great many Places found out, where they
pass'd as well with Horses and Mules, as on
Foot, and even some with Carriages; and in
particular, they told us at <HI>Lima,</HI> That from
<HI>Potasi,</HI> and the Towns thereabouts, there was
a long Valley, which ran for One hundred and
Sixty Leagues in Length <HI>Southward,</HI> and
<HI>S. E.</HI> and that it continued, 'till, the Hills
parting, it opened into the main level Coun∣try
on the other Side; and that there were
several Rivers which began in that great
Valley, and which all of them run away
to the <HI>S.</HI> and the <HI>S. E.</HI> and afterwards, went
away <HI>E.</HI> and <HI>E. N. E.</HI> and so fell into the
great <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI> and empty'd themselves
into the <HI>North-Seas;</HI> and that Merchants
travell'd to those Rivers, and then went
down in Boats its far as the Town or City of
the <HI>Ascension,</HI> and the <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI></P>
<P>This was very satisfying, you may be
sure, especially to hear them agree in it, that
the <HI>Andes</HI> were to be passed (though passing
them hereabouts, where, I knew, the main
<PB N="17" REF="228"/>
Land from the <HI>West</HI> Shore, where we now
were, must be at least One thousand Five
hundred Miles broad) was no Part of my Pro∣ject;
but I laid up all these Things in my
Head, and resolv'd to go away to the <HI>South</HI>
again, and act as I should see Cause.</P>
<P>We were now got into a very hot Climate,
and, whatever was the Cause, my Men began
to grow very sickly, and that to such a
Degree, that I was once afraid we had got
the Plague among us;, but our Surgeons, who
we all call Doctors at Sea, assured me, There
was nothing of that among them, and yet
we buried Seventeen Men here, and had be∣tween
Twenty and Thirty more sick, and,
as I thought, dangerously too.</P>
<P>In this Extremity, for I was really very
much concerned about it, one of my Doctors
came to me, and told me, He had been at
the City (that is at <HI>Lima</HI>) to buy some Drugs
and Medicines to recruit his Chest, and he
had fallen into Company with an <HI>Irish</HI> Jesuit,
who he found was an extraordinary good
Physician, and that he had had some Dis∣course
with him about our sick Men, and,
he believed, for a good Word or Two, he
could persuade him to come and visit them.</P>
<P>I was very loth to consent to it, for,
says I to the Surgeon, If he is an <HI>Irish</HI> Man,
he speaks <HI>English,</HI> and he will presently per∣ceive,
that we are all <HI>English</HI> Men, and so
we shall be betray'd; all our Designs will
be blown up at once, and our farther Mea∣sures
be all broken, and therefore I would
not consent: This I did not speak from the
<PB N="18" REF="229"/>
Fear of any Hurt they could have done me
by Force, for I had no Reason to value that,
being able to have fought my Way, clear out
of their Seas, if I had been put to it; But, as
I had traded all the Way by Stratagem, and
had many considerable Views still behind, I
was unwilling to be disappointed by the Dis∣covery
of my Schemes; or that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
should know upon what a double Foundation
I acted, and how I was a <HI>French</HI> Ally and
Merchant, or an <HI>English</HI> Enemy and Pri∣vateer,
just as I pleas'd, and as Opportunity
should offer; in which case they would have
been sure to have trapann'd me, if possible,
under the Pretence or the former, and have
used me, if they ever should get an Advan∣tage
over me, as one of the latter.</P>
<P>This made me very cautious, and I had
good Reason for it too, and yet the Sickness
and Danger of my Men press'd me very hard
to have the Advice of a good Physician, if
it was possible; and especially to be satis∣fied
whether it was really the Plague or no;
for I was very uneasy about that.</P>
<P>But my Surgeon told me, That as to my
Apprehension of Discovery he would under∣take
to prevent it by this Method; First,
he said, He found that the <HI>Irish</HI> Man did
not understand <HI>French</HI> at all, and so I had
nothing to do but to order, That when he
came on Board, as little <HI>English</HI> should be
spoke in his Hearing as possible; and this was
not difficult, for almost all our Men had a
little <HI>French</HI> at their Tongues End, by hav∣ing
so many <HI>French</HI> Men on Board of them;
<PB N="19" REF="230"/>
others had the <HI>Levant Jargon,</HI> which they
call <HI>Lingua Frank,</HI> so that, if they had but
due Caution, it could not be suddenly per∣ceived
what Country-men they were.</P>
<P>Besides this, the Surgeon ordered, That
as soon as the <HI>Padre</HI> came on Board, he
should be surrounded with <HI>French</HI> Seamen
only, some of which should be ordered to
follow him from Place to Place, and chop in
with their nimble Tongues, upon some Oc∣casion
or other, so that he should hear <HI>French</HI>
spoken where-ever he turn'd himself.</P>
<P>Upon this, which, indeed, appeared very
easy to be done, I agreed to let the Doctor
come on Board, and accordingly the Surgeon
brought him the next Day, where Captain
<HI>Merlote</HI> received him in the Cabbin, and
treated him very handsomly, but nothing
was spoken but <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spanish;</HI> and the
Surgeon, who had pretended himself to be an
<HI>Irish</HI> Man, acted as Interpreter between the
Doctor and us.</P>
<P>Here we told him the Case of our Men
that were sick; some of them, indeed, were
<HI>French,</HI> and others that could speak <HI>French,</HI>
were instructed to speak to him, as if they
could speak no other Tongue, and them the
Surgeon interpreted; others who were <HI>English,</HI>
were call'd <HI>Irish</HI> Men, and Two or three
were allowed to be Engish Sea-men, pick'd
up in the <HI>East Indies,</HI> as we had Sea-men, we
told him, of all Nations.</P>
<P>The Matter, in short, was so carry'd, that
the good Man, for such I really think he
was, had no manner of Suspicion; and, to
<PB N="20" REF="231"/>
do him Justice, He was an admirable Phy∣sician,
and did oar Men a great deal o
good; for all of them, but Three, recovered
under his Hands, and those Three had reco∣vered,
if they had not, like mad Men, dranl
Punch when they were almost well, and by
their Intemperance, inflam'd their Blood, and
thereby thrown themselves back again into
their Fever, and put themselves, as the <HI>Padre</HI>
said of them, out of the Reach of <HI>Medicine.</HI></P>
<P>We treated this Man of Art with a great
deal of Respect, made him some very hand∣some
Presents, and particularly such as he
could not come at in the Country where he
was; besides which, I ordered he should have
the Value of One hundred Dollars in Gold
given him; but he, on the other Hand, thank∣ing
Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> for his Bounty, would
have no Money; but he accepted a Present of
some Linen, a few Handkerchiefs, some Nut∣megs,
and a Piece of Black Bays, most of
which, however, he said, he made Presents of
again in the City among some of his Ac∣quaintance.</P>
<P>But he had a farther Design in his Head,
which afterwards he communicated in Con∣fidence
to the Surgeon I have mentioned,
who convers'd with him, and by him to me,
and which was to him, indeed, of the highest
Importance. The Case was this;</P>
<P>He takes our Surgeon on Shore with him
one Day from the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship, where he
had been with him to visit some of our sick
Men, and drinking a Glass of Wine with
him, he told him, He had a Favour to ask
<PB N="21" REF="232"/>
of him, and a Thing to reveal to him in
Confidence, which was of the utmost Con∣sequence
to himself, though of no great Value
to him (the Surgeon) and if he would pro∣mise
the utmost Secrecy to him on his Faith
and Honour, he would put his Life into
his Hands, <HI>For, Seignior,</HI> says he, <HI>it will be
no less, nor would any thing less than my Life,
says he, pay for it, if you should discover it to
any</HI> of the People here, or any where else on
this Coast.</P>
<P>The Surgeon was a very honest Man, and
carry'd, indeed, the Index of it in his Face,
and the <HI>Padre</HI> said afterwards, He inclin'd
to put this Confidence in him, because he
thought he saw something of an honest Man
in his very Countenance: After so frank a
Beginning, the Surgeon made no Scruple to
tell him, That seeing he inclin'd to treat him
with such Confidence, and to put a Trust of
so great Importance in him, he would give
him all the Assurance that was in his Power,
that he would be as faithful to him, as it
was possible to be to himself; and that the
Secret should never go out of his Mouth to
any one in the World, but to such, and at
such Time, as he should consent to and di∣rect.
In short, He used so many solemn Pro∣testations,
that the <HI>Padre</HI> made no Scruple
to trust him with the Secret, which, indeed,
was no less than putting his Life into his
Hands: The Case was this. Me told him, He
had heard them talk of going to <HI>Ireland</HI> in
their Return, and as he had been Thirty
Years out of his own Country, in such a
<PB N="22" REF="233"/>
remote Part of the World, where it was never
likely, that he should ever see it again, the
Notion he had entertain'd, that this Ship
was going thither, and might set him o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Shore there, that he might once more see his
Native Country, and his Family and Friends,
had sill'd his Mind with such a surprizing
Joy, that he could no longer contain him∣self
and that, therefore, if he would procure
Leave of the Captain, that he might come
privately on Board, and take his Passage
home, he would willingly pay whatever the
Captain should desire of him; but that it
must be done with the greatest Secrecy ima∣ginable,
or else he was undone for that if
he should be discovered and stopp'd, he should
be confin'd in the <HI>Jesuits</HI> House there, as
long as he liv'd.</P>
<P>The Surgeon told him, The Thing was
easy to be done, if he would give him leave to
acquaint one Man in the Ship with it, which
was not Captain <HI>Merlote,</HI> but a certain <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Man, who was a considerable Person in
the Ship, without whom the Captain did
nothing, and who would be more secure to
trust, by far, than Captain <HI>Merlote.</HI> The
<HI>Padre</HI> told him, That without asking him
any Reasons, since he had put his Life in
his Hands, he would trust him with the
Management of it, and therefore left it in∣tirely
to him.</P>
<P>The Surgeon accordingly brought him on
Board to me, and making a Confidence of
the whole Matter to me, I turn'd to the
<HI>Padre,</HI> and told him in <HI>English,</HI> giving him
<PB N="23" REF="234"/>
my Hand, That I would be under all the
Engagements and Promises of Secrecy, that
our Surgeon had been in, for his Security
and Satisfaction; That he had merited too
well of us, for us to wish him any Ill; and,
in short, That the whole Ship should be en∣gag'd
for his Security. I told him, That as
to his coming on Board, and bringing any
thing off that belonged to him, he must take
his own Measures, and answer to himself for
the Success; but that after he was on Board,
we would sink the Ship under him, or blow
her up into the Air, before we would deliver
him up, on any Account whatever.</P>
<P>He was so pleas'd with my frank Way of
talking to him, that he told me, He would
put his Life into my Hands, with the same
Freedom as he had done before with my Sur∣geon;
so we began to concert Measures for
his coming on Board with Secrecy.</P>
<P>He told us, There was no need of any Pro∣posals,
for he would acquaint the Head of
their House, that he intended to go on board
the <HI>French</HI> Ship in the Road, and to go to
St. <HI>Jogo,</HI> where he had several Times been in
the same manner; and that, as they had not
the least Suspicion or him, he was very well
satisfied, that they would make no Scruple
of it.</P>
<P>But his Mistake in this might have been
his Ruin; for tho' had it been a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship,
they wou'd not have mistrusted him, vet
when he nam'd the <HI>French</HI> Ship in the Road
of <HI>Callao,</HI> they began to question him very
smartly about it: Upon which he was oblig'd
<PB N="24" REF="235"/>
to tell them, That since they were
doubtful of him, he would not go at all,
telling them withal, That it was hard sus∣pect
him who had been so faithful to his
Vows, as to reside for near Thirty Years
among them, when he might frequently have
made an Escape from them, if he had been
so disposed. So for Three or Four Days he
made no Appearance of going at all; but
having had private Notice from me the Even∣ing
before we sail'd, he found Means to get
out of their Hands, came down to <HI>Callao</HI> on
a Mule in the Night, and our Surgeon lying
ready with our Boat about half a League
from the Town, as by Appointment, he took
him on Board, with a Negro his Servant,
and brought him safe to the Ship: Nor had
we receiv'd him on Board half an Hour, but,
being unmoored and ready to sail, we put
out to Sea, and carry'd him clear off.</P>
<P>He made his Excuses to me, That he was
come away naked, according to his Profes∣sion;
that he had purposed to have furnish'd
himself with some Provisions for the Voyage,
but that the unexpected Suspicions of the
Head of their College, or House, had oblig'd
him to come away in a Manner that would
not admit of it; for that he might rather be
said to have made his Escape, than to have
been come fairly off.</P>
<P>I told him, He was very welcome; (And in∣deed
so he was, for he had been already
more worth to us than ten times his Passage
came to) and, That he should be entred into
immediate Pay, as Physician to both the
<PB N="25" REF="236"/>
Ships, which I was sure none of our Surgeons
would repine at, but rather be glad of; and
accordingly I immediately order'd him a
Cabbin, with a very good Appartment ad∣joining
to it, and appointed him to eat in
my own Mess whenever he pleas'd, or by
himself, on his particular Days, when he
thought fit.</P>
<P>And now it was impossible to conceal from
him, that we were indeed an <HI>English</HI> Ship,
and that I was the Captain in Chief; except,
as has been said upon Occasion of coming to
any particular Town of <HI>Spain;</HI> I let
him know, I had a Commission to make
Prize of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and appear their
open Enemy, but that I had chosen to treat
them as Friends, in a Way of Commerce, as
he had seen. He admir'd much the Mode∣ration
I had used, and how I had avoided
inriching my self by the Spoil, as I might
have done; and he made me many Compli∣ments
upon that Head, which I excused hear∣ing,
and begg'd him to forbear: I told him,
We were Christians, and as we had made a
very prosperous Voyage, I was resolved not
to do any honest Men the least Injustice,
it I could avoid it.</P>
<P>But I must observe here, That I did not
enter immediately into all this Confidence
with him neither, nor all at once, neither
did I let him into any Part of it, but under
the same solemn Engagements of Secrecy
that he had laid upon us, nor till I was
come above Eighty Leagues South from
<HI>Lima.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="237"/>
The first Thing I took the Freedom to
speak to him upon, was this; Finding his Ha∣bit
a little offensive to our rude Seamen, I
took him into the Cabbin, the very next
Day after we came to Sea, and told him,
That I was obliged to mention to him what I
knew he would soon perceive, namely, That we
were all Protestants, except Three or Four of the
<HI>Frenchmen;</HI> and I did not know how agree∣able
that might be to him: He answer'd,
That he was not at all offended with that
Part; That it was none of his Business to en∣quire
into any one's Opinion, any farther
than they gave him Leave; That if it was
his Business to cure the Souls of Men on
Shore, his Business on Board was to cure
their Bodies; and as for the rest, he would
exercise no other Function than that of a Phy∣sician
on board the Ship, without my Leave.</P>
<P>I told him, That was very obliging; but
that then, for his own Sake, I had a Proposal
to make him, which was, Whether it would
be disagreeable to him to lay aside the Habit
of a Religious, and put on that of a Gentle∣man,
so to accommodate himself the more
easily to the Men on board, who, perhaps,
might be rude to him in his Habit; Seamen
being not always Men of the most Man∣ners.</P>
<P>He thank'd me very sincerely: He told
me, He had been in <HI>England</HI> as well as in <HI>Ire∣land;</HI>
and that he went dress'd there as a Gen∣tleman,
and was ready to do so now, if I
thought fit, to avoid giving any Offence;
and added, that he chose to do so; But then,
<PB N="27" REF="238"/>
smiling, said, He was at a great Loss, for
he had no Cloaths. I bad him take no Care
about that, for I would furnish him: And
immediately we dressed him up like an <HI>Eng∣lishman,</HI>
in a Suit of very good Cloaths,
which belong'd to one of our Midship-men
that died. I gave him also a good Wig and
a Sword, and he presently appear'd upon the
Quarter-Deck like a grave Physician, and
was called <HI>Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>From that Minute, by whose Contrivance
we knew not, it went current among the
Seamen, that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Doctor was an
<HI>Englishman,</HI> and a Protestant, and only had
put on the other Habit to disguise himself,
and make his Escape to us: And this was so
universally believ'd, that it held to the last Day
of the whole Voyage; for as soon as I met
with it, I took Care that no body that had
it in their Power would ever contradict it;
And as for the Doctor himself, he was very
glad of it and when he first heard of it,
said, Nothing could be more to his Advan∣tage,
and that he would take Care to humour
it among the Men, as far as lay in his Power.</P>
<P>However, the Doctor took Care of one
Thing, and earnestly desired we would all
be mindful of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That he never offered
to go on Shore, whatever Port we came to
afterwards, and what he desired of us, was,
that none of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> might, by Enqui∣ry,
hear, upon any Occasion, at his being
on board our Ship; but above all, That none
of our Men, <HI>the Officers especially,</HI> would
ever come so much in Reach of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="239"/>
on Shore, as to put it into their Power to
seize upon them by Reprizal, and so oblige
us to deliver him up by Exchange.</P>
<P>I went so far with him, and so did Cap∣tain
<HI>Merlote</HI> also, as to assure him, That if
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> should, by any Stratagem, or
by Force, get any of our Men, nay, tho' it
was our selves, into their Hands, yet he
should, upon no Conditions whatever, be deli∣vered
up. And, indeed, for this very Rea∣son
we were very shy of going on Shore at
all; and as we had really no Business any
where but just for Water and fresh Provisions,
which we also had taken in a very good
Store of at <HI>Lima,</HI> so, for our Part, we put in
no where at all, in the Coast of <HI>Peru,</HI> because
there we might have been more particularly
liable to the Impertinencies of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
Inquiry; As to Force, we were furnished
not to be in the least apprehensive of that.</P>
<P>Being thus, I say resolved to have no more to
do with the Coast of <HI>Peru,</HI> we stood off to Sea,
and the first Land we made, was a little un∣frequented
Island, in the Latitude of 17 deg.
13 m. where our Men went on Shore in the
Boats three or four times to catch Tortoises, or
Turtles, being the first we had met with since
we came from the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> And here they
took so many, and had such a prodigious
Quantity of Eggs out of them, that the
whole Company of both Ships liv'd on them
till within four or five Days of our coming
to the Island of <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> which was
our next Port. Some of these Tortoises were
so large and so heavy, that no single Man
<PB N="29" REF="240"/>
could turn them, and sometimes, as much
as Four Men could carry to the Boats.</P>
<P>We met with some bad Weather after this,
which blew us off to Sea, the Wind blowing
very hard, at the <HI>South-East;</HI> but it was not
so great a Wind as to endanger us, tho' we
lost Sight of one another more in this Storm,
than we had done in all our Voyage: How∣ever,
we were none of us in any great Con∣cern
for it now, because we had agreed be∣fore,
that if we should lose one another, we
should make the best of our Way to the
Island of <HI>Juan Fernandes:</HI> And this we ob∣serv'd
now so directly, that all of us sha∣ping
our Course for the Island, as soon as the
Storm abated, came in Sight of one another
long before we came thither; which, you
may be sure, was very agreeable to us all.</P>
<P>We were, including the Time of the Storm,
Two Hundred and Eighteen Days from <HI>Lima</HI>
to the Island of <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> having most
of the Time cross contrary Winds, and more
bad Weather than is usual in those Seas:
However, we were all in good Condition,
both Ships and Men.</P>
<P>Here we fell to the old Trade of hunting
of Goats. And here our new Doctor set some
of our Men to Simpling, that is to say, to
gather some Physical Herbs, which he let
them see afterwards were very well worth their
while. Our Surgeons assisted, and saw the
Plants, but had never observ'd the same Kind
in <HI>England.</HI> They gave me the Names of
them; and 'tis the only Discovery in all my
Travels which I have not reserv'd so carefully
<PB N="30" REF="241"/>
as to pubilsh for the Advantage of others
and which I regret the Omission of very
much.</P>
<P>While we were here, an odd Accident gave
me some Uneasiness, which, however, did not
come to much: Early in the Gray of the
Morning, little Wind, and a smooth Sea, a
small Frigate-built Vessel, under <HI>Spanish</HI> Co∣lours,
Pennant flying, appear'd off at Sea, at
the Opening of the <HI>N. E.</HI> Point of the Island; as
soon as she came fair with the Road, she lay
by, as if she came to look into the Port only,
and when she perceiv'd that we began to loose
our Sails to speak with her, she stretch'd away
to the Northward, and then altering her
Course, stood away <HI>N. E.</HI> using Oars to assist
her, and so got away.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more evident to us, than
that she came to look at us, nor could we
imagine any thing less; from whence we im∣mediately
concluded, that we were discover'd,
and that our taking away the Doctor had gi∣ven
a great Alarm among the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (as
indeed we afterwards came to understand it
had done). But we came a little while after∣wards
to a better Understanding about the
Frigate.</P>
<P>I was so uneasy about it, that I resolv'd
to speak with her if possible; so I order'd
the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship, which, of the Two,
was rather a better Sailer, than our own, to
stand in directly to the Coast of <HI>Chili,</HI> and
then to ply to the Northward just in Sight of
the Shore, till he crime into the Latitude of
22; and if he saw nothing in all that Run, then
<PB N="31" REF="242"/>
to come down again directly into the Latitude
of the Island of <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> but keep∣ing
the Distance of Ten Leagues off farther
than before, and to ply off and on in that
Latitude Five Days, and then, if he did not
meet with me, to stand in for the Island.</P>
<P>While he did this, I did the same at the
Distance of near Fifty Leagues from the
Shore, being the Distance which I thought
the Frigate kept in as she stood away from
me. We made our Cruise both of us very
punctually, and I found him in the Station
we agreed on, and we both stood into the
Road again from whence we came.</P>
<P>We no sooner made the Road, but we saw
the Frigate, as I call'd her, with another
Ship, at an Anchor in the same Road where
she had seen us: And it was easy to see that
they were both of them in a great Surprize
and Hurry at our appearing, and that they
were under Sail in so very little Time, as
that we easily saw they had slipp'd their Ca∣bles,
or cut away their Anchors. They
fir'd Guns twice, which we found was a Sig∣nal
for their Boats, which were on Shore, to
come on board; and soon after, we saw
Three Boats go off to them; tho' as we un∣derstood
afterwards, they were obliged to
leave Sixteen or Seventeen of their Men be∣hind
them, who, being among the Rocks
catching of Goats, either did not hear the
Signals, or could not come to their Boats
time enough.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="243"/>
When we saw them in this Hurry, we
thought it must be something extraordinary,
and bore down directly upon them, having
the Weather-Gage.</P>
<P>They were Ships of pretty good Force, and
full of Men; and when they saw we were re∣solv'd
to speak with them, and that there was
no getting away from us, they made ready
to fight us; and putting themselves upon a
Wind, first stretching a Head to get the
Weather-Gage of us, when they thought they
were pretty well, boldly tack'd, and lay by
for us, hoisting the <HI>English</HI> Antient and Union-Jack.</P>
<P>We had our <HI>French</HI> Colours out till now;
but being just, as we thought, going to engage,
I told Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> I scorn'd to hide what
Nation I was of when I came to fight for the
Honour of our Country; and, besides, as
these People had spread <HI>English</HI> Colours, I
ought to let them know what I was; that if
they were really <HI>English</HI> and Friends, we
might not fight by Mistake, and shed the
innocent Blood of our own Countrymen; and
that if they were Rogues, and counterfeited
their being <HI>English,</HI> we should soon per∣ceive
it.</P>
<P>However, when they saw us put out <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Colours, they knew not what to think
of it, but lay by a while to see what we
would do. I was as much puzled as they, for
as I came nearer, I thought they seem'd to be
<HI>English</HI> Ships, as well by their Bulk as by
their Way of Working; and as I came still
nearer, I thought I could perceive so plainly
<PB N="33" REF="244"/>
by my Glasses, that they were <HI>English</HI> Sea∣men,
that I made a Signal to our other Ship,
who had the Van, and was just bearing down
upon them, to bring to; and I sent my Boat
to him, to know his Opinion: He sent me
Word, He did believe them to be <HI>English;</HI> and
the more (said he) because they could be no other
Nation but <HI>English</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> and the Latter
he was sure they were not; but since we
were the largest Ships, and that they might
as plainly see us to be <HI>English,</HI> as we could
see them, he said, he was for fighting them,
because they ought to let us know who they
were first: However, as I had fir'd a Gun to
bring him to, he lay by a little till we
spoke thus together.</P>
<P>While this was doing we could see one of their
Boats come off with Six Oars, and Two Men (a
Lieutenant and a Trumpeter it seems they were)
sitting in the Stern, and one of them holding up a
Flag of Truce: We let them come forward, and
when they came nearer, so that we could b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le em
with a Speaking-Trumpet, we ask'd em, What
Countrymen they were? and they answer'd,
<HI>Englishmen.</HI> Then we ask'd them, Whence
their Ship? Their Answer was, From <HI>London.</HI>
At which we bad them come on Board, which
they did and we soon found, that we were
all Countrymen and Friends, and their Boat
went immediately back to let them know it.
We found, afterwards, that they were mere
Privateers, fitted out from <HI>London</HI> also, but
coming last from <HI>Jamaica;</HI> and we let them
know no other or our selves; but declin'd
keeping Company, telling them, We were
<PB N="34" REF="245"/>
bound now upon Traffick, and not for Pur∣chace;
That we had been at the <HI>East Indies,</HI>
had made some Prizes, and were going back
thither again. They told us, They were come
into the South Seas for Purchace, but that
they had made little of it; having heard there
were Three large <HI>French</HI> Men of War in those
Seas, in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Service, which made them
wish, that they had not come about; and that
they were still very doubtful what to do.</P>
<P>We assur'd them, We had been the Heighth of
<HI>Lima;</HI> and that we had not heard of any
Men of War, but that we had pass'd for
such our selves, and perhaps were the
Ships they had heard of; for that we were
Three Sail at first, and had sometimes carry'd
<HI>French</HI> Colours.</P>
<P>This made them very glad; for it was cer∣tainly
so, that we had pass'd for Three
<HI>French</HI> Men of War; and they were so as∣sur'd
of it, that they went afterwards boldly
up the Coast, and made several very good Prizes,
We then found also, that it was one of these
Ships that look'd into the Road, as above,
when we were here before, and seeing us then
with <HI>French</HI> Colours, took us for the Men of
War they had heard of: And they added,
That when we came in upon them again, they
gave themselves up for lost Men, bur were re∣solv'd
to have sought it out to the Last, or
rather to have sunk by our Side, or blow them∣selves
up, than be taken.</P>
<P>I was not at all sorry that we had made this
Discovery before we engag'd, for the Captains
were two brave resolute Fellows, and had two
<PB N="35" REF="246"/>
very good Ships under them, one of Thirty∣six
Guns, but able to have carry'd Forty-four
Guns; the other, which we called the
Frigate-built Ship, carry'd Twenty-eight
Guns, and they were both full of Men. Now,
tho' we should not have fear'd their Force,
yet my Case differ'd from what it did at
first, for we had that on Board that makes
all Men Cowards, I mean Money of which
we had such a Cargo as few <HI>British</HI> Ships
ever brought out of those Seas; and I was
one of those that had now no Occasion to run
needless Hazards; so that, in short, I was as
well pleas'd without fighting, as they could
be: Besides, I had other Projects now in my
Head, and those of no less Consequence, than
of planting a new World, and settling
new Kingdoms to the Honour and Advantage
of my Country; and many a Time I wish'd
heartily, That all my rich Cargo was safe at
<HI>London;</HI> That my Merchants were sharing
the Silver, and the Gold, and the Pearl
among themselves, and, That I was but safe
on Shore, with a Thousand good Families, up∣on
the South of <HI>Chili,</HI> and about Fifteen Hun∣dred
good Soldiers, and Arms for Ten Thou∣sand
more (of which by-and-by) and with the
Two Ships I had now with me, I would not
apprehend all the Power of the Spaniards,
I mean, that they could bring against me in the
<HI>South-Seas.</HI></P>
<P>I had all these Things, I say in my Head al∣ready,
tho' nothing like to what I had after∣wards,
when I saw farther into the Matter my∣self;
However, these Things made me very glad,
<PB N="36" REF="247"/>
that I had no Occasion to engage those
Ships.</P>
<P>When we came thus to understand one ano∣ther,
we went all into the Road together, and
I invited the Captains of the Two Privateers
on board me, where I treated them with the
best I had; tho' I had no great Dainties now,
having been so long out of <HI>England.</HI> They
invited me, and Captain <HI>Merlote,</HI> and the
Captain of the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship, in Return,
and indeed treated us very nobly.</P>
<P>After this, we exchang'd some Presents of
Refreshments, and, particularly, they sent me
a Hogshead of Rum, which was very accept∣able;
and I sent them, in Return, a Runlet
of Arrack, excusing myself, that I had no
great Store. I sent them also the Quantity
of One Hundred Weight of Nutmegs and
Cloves; but the most agreeable Present I sent
them, was, Twenty Pieces of my <HI>Madagascar</HI>
Dryed Beef, cur'd in the Sun, the like of
which they had never seen or tasted before;
and, without Question, 'tis such an excellent
Way of curing Beef, that if I were to be at
<HI>Madagascar</HI> again, I would take in a sufficient
Quantity of Beef so preserv'd, to victual the
whole Ship for the Voyage; and I leave it
as a Direction to all <HI>English</HI> Seamen that have
Occasion to use <HI>East-India</HI> Voyages.</P>
<P>I bought afterwards Six Hogsheads of Rum
of these Privateers, for I found they were
very well stor'd with Liquors, whatever else
they wanted.</P>
<P>We stay'd hero Twelve or Fourteen Days,
but took Care, by Agreement, that our Men
<PB N="37" REF="248"/>
should never go on Shore the same Days
that their Men went on Shore, or theirs
when ours went; as well to avoid their Caball∣ing
together, as to avoid Quarreling; tho'
the latter was the Pretence. We agreed also,
not to receive on Board any of our Ships
respectively any of the Crews belonging to
the other: And this was their Advantage,
for if we would have given Way to that, half
their Men, would, for ought I know, have
come over to us.</P>
<P>While we lay here, one of them went a
cruizing, finding the Wind fair to run in for
the Shore, and in about Five Days she came
back with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Prize, laden with
Meal, Cocoa, and a large Quantity of Bis∣cuit,
ready bak'd; She was bound to
<HI>Lima,</HI> from <HI>Baldivia,</HI> or some Port nearer;
I do not remember, exactly, which: They
had some Gold on Board, but not much, and
had bought their Lading at St. <HI>Jago.</HI> As
soon as we saw them coming in with a Prize
in Tow, we put out our <HI>French</HI> Colours,
and gave Notice to the Privateers, that it
was for their Advantage that we did so; and
so indeed it was, for it would presently have
alarmed all the Country, if such a Fleet of
Privateers had appear'd on the Coast. We
Prevail'd with them to give us their <HI>Spanish</HI>
Prisoners, and to allow us to set them on
Shore; I having assur'd them, I would not
land them till I came to <HI>Baldivia,</HI> nor suffer
them to have the least Correspondence
with any Body till they came thither; the
Spaniards also giving their Parole of
<PB N="38" REF="249"/>
Honour, not to give any Account of their
being taken, till Fourteen Days after they
were on Shore.</P>
<P>This being the farthest Port <HI>South</HI> which
the said <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Masters of in <HI>Chili,</HI> or in∣deed
on the whole Continent of <HI>America,</HI> they
could not desire me to carry them any far∣ther:
They allow'd us a Quantity of Meal
and Cocoa out of their Booty, for the Sub∣sistance
of the Prisoners; and I bought a
larger Quantity more of it, there being
more than they knew how to stow; and they
did not resolve to keep the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship
which they took; By this Means, I was
doubly stock'd with Flower and Bread; but
as the first was very good, and well pack'd
in Cask, and very good Jars, it was no
Burthen.</P>
<P>We bought also some of their Cocoa, and
made Chocolate till our Men gorg'd them∣selves
with it, and would eat no more.</P>
<P>Having furnish'd our selves here with
Goats Flesh, as usual, and taken in Water
sufficient, we left <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> and saw the
Cruisers go out the same Tide, they steering
<HI>N. N. E.</HI> and we <HI>S. S. E.</HI> They saluted us
at parting, and we bad them Good-bye in the
same Language.</P>
<P>While we were now sailing for the Coast
of <HI>Chili,</HI> with fair Wind and pleasant Wea∣ther,
ther, my <HI>Spanish</HI> Doctor came to me, and
told me, he had a Piece of News to acquaint
me with, which, he said, he believ'd would
please me very well; and this was, That
one of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Prisoners was a Planter,
<PB N="39" REF="250"/>
as 'tis call'd in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> or a Farmer as
we should call it in <HI>England,</HI> of <HI>Villa-Rica,</HI> a
Town built by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> near the Foot of
the <HI>Andes,</HI> above the Town of <HI>Baldivia;</HI> and
that he had entred into Discourse with him upon
the Situation of those Hills, the Nature of
the Surface, the Rivers, Hollows, Passages,
into them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whether there were any Valleys
within the Hills, of what Extent, how wa∣tred,
what Cattle, what People, how disposed,
and the like and, in short, if there was any
passing over them: and he told me, in few
Words, That he found him to be a very honest,
frank, open sort of a Person, who seem'd to
speak without Reserve, without the least
Jealousy or Apprehension; and that, in a
Word, he believ'd, I might have an ample
Discovery from him of all that I desir'd to
know.</P>
<P>I was very glad of tins News, you may be
sure; and it was not many Hours before I
made him bring the <HI>Spaniard</HI> into the great
Cabbin to me, where I treated him very
civilly, and gave him Opportunity several
Times, to see himself very well used; and
indeed all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Ship were
very thankful, for my bringing them out
of the Hands of the Privateers, and took
all Occasions to let us see it.</P>
<P>I said little the first Time, but discours'd in
general of <HI>America,</HI> of the Greatness and Opu∣lency
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there; the insinite Wealth
of the Country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and I remember well, dis∣coursing
once of the great Riches of the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI> the Silver Mines of
<PB N="40" REF="251"/>
<HI>Potosi,</HI> and other Places, he turn'd shor
upon me, smiling, and said, We <HI>Spaniard</HI>
are the worst Nation in the World
that such a Treasure as this could have belong'd
to; for if it had fallen into any other Hands
than ours, says he, they would have search'd
farther into it before now. I ask'd him, What
he meant by that? I said, I thought they had
search'd it thoroughly enough; for that I
believ'd no Nation in the World could ever
have spread such vast Dominions, and planted
a Country of such a prodigious Extent, and
have not only kept the Possession of it, but
have maintain'd the Government also, and
even inhabited it, with so few People.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Seignior, says he, you think, not∣withstanding
that Opinion of yours, that we
have many more People of our Nation in
New-Spain than we have. I do not know,
said I, how many you may have; but if I
should believe, you have as many here as in
<HI>Old-Spain,</HI> it would be but a few in Compari∣son
of the infinite Extent of the King of
<HI>Spain</HI>'s Dominions in <HI>America;</HI> And then, add∣ed
he, I assure you, Seignior, there is not
one <HI>Spaniard</HI> to a Thousand Acres of Land,
take one Place with another throughout <HI>New-Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Very well, said I, then I think the Riches
and Wealth of <HI>America</HI> is very well searched,
in Comparison to the Number of People you
have to search after it: No, says he, it is not
neither; for the greatest Number of our People
live in that Part where the Wealth is not
greatest; and where even the Governor and
<PB N="41" REF="252"/>
Viceroy, enjoying a plentiful and luxurious
Life, they take no Thought for the Encrease, ei∣ther
of the King's Revenues, or the National
Wealth: This he spoke of the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI>
whose Greatness, and the Number of its Inha∣bitants,
he said, was a Disease to the rest of
the Body: And what think you, Seignior, said he,
that in that one City, where is neither Silver
or Gold but what is brought from the Moun∣tains
of St. <HI>Clara,</HI> the Mines at St. <HI>Augustine</HI>'s
and our <HI>Lady,</HI> some of which are an Hundred
Leagues from it, and yet there are more <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
in <HI>Mexico</HI> than in both these two prodi∣gious
Empires of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru?</HI></P>
<P>I seem'd not to believe him; and indeed I
did not believe him at first, till he return'd to
me with a Question, Pray, Seignior Capitain,
says he, how many <HI>Spaniards</HI> do you think
there may be in this vast Country of <HI>Chili?</HI>
I told him, I could make no guess of the Num∣bers
but, without Question, there were many
Thousands; intimating, that I might suppose
near an Hundred Thousand: At which he
laugh'd heartily, and assur'd me, That there
were not above Two Thousand Five Hundred
in the whole Kingdom, besides Women and
Children, and some few Soldiers, which they
looked upon as nothing to Inhabitants, because
they were not settled any where.</P>
<P>I was indeed surpriz'd, and began to name
some large Places, which I thought had singly
more <HI>Spaniards</HI> in them than what he talk'd of.
He presently ran over some of them; and
naming <HI>Baldivia</HI> first, as the most <HI>Southward,</HI>
he ask'd me, How many I thought were there?
<PB N="42" REF="253"/>
And I told him, About Three Hundred Fa∣milies:
He smil'd at me, and assur'd me,
there were not above Three or Four and Fifty
Families in the whole Place, and about
Twenty-five Soldiers; altho' it was a Forti∣fication,
and a Frontier. (At <HI>Villa Rica,</HI> or the
Rich Town) where he liv'd, he said, There
might be about Sixty Families, and a Lieu∣tenant
with Twenty Soldiers. In a Word, we
pass'd over the many Places between, and
came to the Capital St. <HI>Jago,</HI> where after I
had supposed there were Five Thousand
<HI>Spaniards;</HI> he protested to me, there were not
above Eight Hundred, including the Viceroy's
Court, and including the Families at <HI>Valpa∣riso,</HI>
which is the Sea-Port, and excluding
only the Soldiers, which, as he said, being the
Capital of the whole Kingdom, might be
about Two Hundred, and excluding the Religious,
who, he added, laughing, signify'd no∣thing
to the planting a Country, for they
neither cultivated the Land, nor increased
the People.</P>
<P>Our Doctor, who was our Interpreter,
smil'd at this, but merrily said, That was very,
true, or ought to be so; intimating, that tho'
the Priests do not cultivate the Land, yet
they might chance to increase the People a
little; but that was by the Way. As to the
Number of Inhabitants at Sr. <HI>Jago,</HI> the
Dodtor agreed with him, and said, he believ'd
he had said more than there was, rather than
less.</P>
<P>As then to the Kingdom or Empire of <HI>Peru,</HI>
in which there are many considerable Cities
<PB N="43" REF="254"/>
and Places of Note, such as <HI>Lima, Quitto,
Cusco la Plata,</HI> and others; besides the great
Number of Towns on the Sea-Coasts, such
as Port <HI>Arica,</HI> St. <HI>Miguel, Payta, Guyaquil,
Truxillo,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>He answered, That it was true, that the
City of Lima, with the Town of <HI>Callao,</HI> was
much increased within a few Years; and,
particularly, of late, by the settling of between
Three and Four Hundred <HI>French</HI> there, who
came by the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s License; but that
before the coming of those Gentlemen, at
which he shook his Head, the Country was
richer, tho' the Inhabitants were not so many;
and that, take it as it was now, there could
not be reckoned above Fifteen Hundred Fa∣milies
of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> excluding the Soldiers,
and the Clergy, which, as above, he reckoned
nothing as to the planting the Country.</P>
<P>We came then to discourse of the Silver-Mines
at <HI>Potosi,</HI> and here he supposed, as I
did also, a very great Number of People; But,
Seignior, says he, What People is it you are
speaking of? There are many Thousands of
Servants, but few Masters; there is a Garison
of Four Hundred Soldiers, always kept in
Arms, and in good Order, to secure the Place,
and keep the Negroes and Criminals, who
work in the Mines, in Subjection but,
that there were not besides Five Hun∣dred
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> that is to say Men, in the
whole Place and its Adjacents. So that, in
short, he would not allow above Seven Thousand
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in the whole Empire of <HI>Peru,</HI> and
Two Tuousand Five Hundred in <HI>Chili;</HI> at the
<PB N="44" REF="255"/>
same Time allowing Twice as many as both
these in the City of <HI>Mexico</HI> only.</P>
<P>After this Discourse was over, I ask'd him,
What he inferr'd from it, as to the Wealth of
the Country not being discover'd? He an∣swer'd,
It was evident that it was for want
of People that the Wealth of the Country lay
hid; That there was infinitely more lay un∣enquir'd
after, than had yet been known; That
there were several Mountains in <HI>Peru</HI> equally
rich in Silver with that of <HI>Potosi;</HI> And as
for <HI>Chili,</HI> says he, and the Country where we
live, there is more Gold at this Time in the
Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI> and more easy to
come at, than in all the World besides: Nay,
says he, with some Passion, there is more
Gold every Year wash'd down out of the
<HI>Andes</HI> of <HI>Chili</HI> into the Sea, and lost there,
than all the Riches that go from <HI>New Spain</HI>
to <HI>Europe</HI> in Twenty Years, amount to.</P>
<P>This Discourse fir'd my Imagination, you
may he sure, and I renewed it upon all Occa∣sions,
taking more or less Time, every Day,
to talk with this <HI>Spaniard</HI> upon the <HI>Sub∣ject</HI>
of Cultivation of the Lands, Improve∣ment
of the Country, and the like; always
making such Enquiries into the State of the
Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI> as best suited my
Purpose, but yet so as not to give him the
least Intimation of my Design.</P>
<P>One Day, conversing with him again about
the great Riches of the Country, and of the
Mountains and Rivers, as above, I asked
him, That seeing the Place was so rich, why
<PB N="45" REF="256"/>
were they not all Princes, or as rich as Princes,
that dwelt there?</P>
<P>He shook his Head, and said, It was a
great Reproach upon them many Ways; and
when I press'd him to explain himself, he
answered, It was occasioned by Two Things;
namely, Pride and Sloth. <HI>Seignior,</HI> says he,
we have so much Pride, that we have no
Avarice, and we do not covet enough to make
us work for it: We walk about sometimes,
says he, on the Banks of the Streams that
come down from the Mountains, and if we
see a bit of Gold lie on the Shore, it may be
we will vouchsafe to lay off our Cloak and
step forward to take it up; but if we were
sure to carry home as much as we could stand
under, we would not strip and go to work
in the Water to wash it out of the Sand; or
take the Pains to get it together; nor, per∣haps,
dishonour ourselves so much as to be
seen carrying a Load, no, not for all the
Value of the Gold itself.</P>
<P>I laugh'd then, indeed; and told him, He
was disposed to jest with his Countrymen, or
to speak Ironically meaning, That they did
not take so much Pains as was required, to
make them effectually rich but that, I sup∣posed,
he would not have me uuderstand
him as he spoke: He said, I might under∣stand
as favourable as I pleased, but I should
and the Fact to be true, if I would go up
with him to <HI>Villa Rica,</HI> when I came to <HI>Baldi∣via;</HI>
and with that, he made his Compliment
to me, and invited me to his House.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="257"/>
I asked him, with a <HI>Con Licentia, Seignior,</HI>
that is, With Pardon for so much Freedom,
That if he lived in so rich a Country, and
where there was so inexhaustible a Treasure
of Gold, how he came to fall into this State of
Captivity? and what made him venture him∣self
upon the Sea to fall into the Hands of
Pyrates?</P>
<P>He answered, That it was on the very Foot
of what he had been complaining of; and
that having seen so much of the Wealth of
the Country he lived in, and having reproach∣ed
himself with that very Indolence which
he now blamed all his Country-men for, he
had resolved, in Conjunction with Two of his
Neighbours the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and Men of good
Substance, to set to work in a Place in the
Mountains where they had found some Gold,
and had seen much wash'd down by the
Water, and to find what might be done in
a thorough Search after the Fund or Mine of
it, which they were sure was not far of; and
that he was going to <HI>Lima,</HI> and from thence, if
he could not be supplied, to <HI>Panama,</HI> to buy
Negroes for the Work, that they might carry
it on with the better Success.</P>
<P>This was a feeling Discourse to me, and
made such an Impression on me, that I secret∣ly
resolved, That when I came to <HI>Baldivia,</HI>
I would go up with this sincere <HI>Spaniard</HI> (for
so I thought him to be, and so I found him)
and would be an Eye-Witness to the Discove∣ry,
which, I thought, was made to my
Hand, and which I found now, I could make
<PB N="47" REF="258"/>
more effectual than by all the Attempts I was
like to make by Second Hand.</P>
<P>From this Time I treated the <HI>Spaniard</HI> with
more than ordinary Courtesy, and told him,
It I was not Captain of a great Ship, and
had a Cargo upon me of other Gentlemens
Estates, he had said so much of those Things,
that I should be tempted to give him a Visit,
as he had desired, and see those monstrous
Mountains of the <HI>Andes.</HI></P>
<P>He told me, That if I would do him so
much Honour, I should not be obliged to any
long Stay that he would procure Mules for
me at <HI>Baldivia,</HI> and that I should go, not to
his House only, but to the Mountain itself,
and see all that I desired, and be back again
in Fourteen Days at the farthest. I shook
my Head, as if it could not be, but he never
lest importuning me; and once or twice,
as if I had been afraid to venture myself with
him, he told me, He would send for his Two
Sons, and leave them in the Ship as Hostages
for my Safety.</P>
<P>I was fully satisfied as to that Point, but
did not let him know my Mind yet; but
every Day we dwelt upon the same Subject,
and I travelled through the Mountains and
Valleys To duely, in every Day's Discourse,
with him, that when I afterwards can<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to
the Places we had talk'd of, it was as if I
had look'd over them in a Map before.</P>
<P>I asked him, If the <HI>Andes</HI> were a more
Wall of Mountains, contiguous and without
Intervals and Spaces like a Fortisication or
Boundary to a Country? Or, Whether they
<PB N="48" REF="259"/>
lay promiscuous and distant from one ano∣ther?
And, Whether there lay any Way over
them into the Country beyond them.</P>
<P>He smil'd when I talk'd of going over them:
He told me, They were so infinitely high, that
no human Creature could live upon the Top;
and withal so steep, and so frightful, that if
there was even a Pair of Stairs up on one Side,
and down on the other, no Man alive would
dare to mount up, or venture down.</P>
<P>But that, as for the Notion of the Hills
being contiguous, like a Wall that had no
Gates, that was all fabulous; that there were
several fair Entrances in among the Moun∣tains,
and large, pleasant, and fruitful Val∣leys
among the Hills, with pleasant Rivers
and Numbers of Inhabitants, and Cattle and
Provisions of all Sorts; and that some of the
most delightful Places to live in, that were in
the whole World, were among those Valleys,
in the very Center of the Highest and most
Dreadful Mountains.</P>
<P>Well, said I, <HI>Seignior,</HI> but how do they go
out of one Valley into another? And whither
do they go at last? He answered me, Those
Valleys are always full of pleasant Rivers
and Brooks, which fall from the Hills, and
are form'd generally into one principal Stream
to every Vale; and that as these must have
their Outlets on one Side of the Hills, or on
the other, so, following the Course of those
Streams, one is always sure to find the Way
out of one Valley into another, and at last,
out of the whole into the open Country; so
that it was very frequent to pass from one
<PB N="49" REF="260"/>
Side to the other of the whole Body of the
Mountains, and not go much higher up Hill,
or down Hill, compared to the Mills in other
Places. It was true, he said, There was no
abrupt visible Parting in the Mountains,
that should seem like a Way cut through
from the Bottom to the Top, which would
be, indeed, frightful, but that as they pass
from some of the Valleys to others, there are
Ascents and Descents, Windings and Turn∣ings,
Sloaping up, and Sloaping down, where
we may stand on those little Ridges, and see
the Waters on one Side run to the <HI>West,</HI> and
on the other Side, to the <HI>East.</HI></P>
<P>I assked him, What kind of a Country
was on the other Side? and how long Time
It would take up to go through from one Side
to the other? He told me, There were Ways,
indeed, that were more mountainous and un∣easy,
in which Men kept upon the Sides or
Declivity of the Hills; in which the Natives
would go, and guide others to go, and
so might pass the whole Ridge of the <HI>Andes</HI>
in Eight or Nine Days; but that those Ways
were esteemed very dismal, lonely and
dangerous, because of wild Beasts; but that
through the Valleys, the Way was easy and
pleasant, and perfectly safe, only farther
about and that those Ways a Man might
be Sixteen or Seventeen Days going through.</P>
<P>I laid up all this in my Heart, to make
use of as I should have Occasion; but I ac∣knowledge,
That it was surprizing to me,
as it was so perfectly agreeing with the No∣tion
that I always entertained of those Moun∣tains,
<PB N="50" REF="261"/>
of the Riches of them, the Facility
of Access to and from them, and the easy
Passage from one Side to another.</P>
<P>The next Discourse I had with him upon
this Subject, I began thus; Well, <HI>Seignior,</HI>
said I, We are now come quite through the
Valleys and Passages of the <HI>Andes,</HI> and, me∣thinks,
I see a vast open Country before me
on the other Side; pray tell me, Have you
ever been so far as to look into that Part of
the World, and what kind of a Country
is it.</P>
<P>He answered gravely, That he had been
far enough several Times, to look at a Di∣stance
into the vast Country I spake of; And
such indeed it is, said he; and as we come
upon the rising Part of the Hills, we see a
great way, and a Country without End; but
as to any Descriptions of it, I can say but
little, added he, only this, That it is a very
fruitful Country on that Side next the Hills:
What it is farther, I know not.</P>
<P>I asked him, If there were any considera∣ble
Rivers in it? and which Way they gene∣rally
run? He said, It could not be, but that
from such a Ridge of Mountains as the <HI>Andes,</HI>
there must be a great many Rivers on that
Side, as there were apparently on this; and
that, as the Country was infinitely larger,
and their Course, in proportion, longer, it
would necessarily follow, That those small
Rivers would run one into another, and so
form great Navigable Rivers, as was the
Case in the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> which originally
sprung from the same Hills, about the City
<PB N="51" REF="262"/>
<HI>La Plata</HI> In <HI>Peru,</HI> and swallowing up all
the Streams of less Note, became, by the
meer Length of its Course, one of the greatest
Rivers in the World: That, as he observed,
most of those Rivers ran rather <HI>South-East∣ward</HI>
than <HI>Northward,</HI> he believed they ran
away to the Sea, a great way farther to the
<HI>South,</HI> than the <HI>Rio de la Plata;</HI> but as to
what Part of the Coast they might come to
the Sea in, that he knew nothing of.</P>
<P>This Account was so rational, that nothing
could be more; and was, indeed, extremely
satisfactory.</P>
<P>It was also very remarkable, That this
agreed exactly with the Accounts before
given me by the Two <HI>Chilian Indians,</HI> or <HI>Na∣tives,</HI>
which I had on Board, and with whom
I still continued to discourse as Occasion pre∣sented;
but who, at this Time, I removed
into the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship, to make Room for,
these <HI>Spanish</HI> Prisoners.</P>
<P>I observed the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was made very
sensible by my Doctor of the Obligation both
he and his Fellow-Prisoners were Under to me,
in my persuading the Privateers to set them
at Liberty, and in undertaking to carry them
home to that Part of <HI>Spain</HI> from whence they
came; for as they had lost their Cargo, their
Voyage seemed to be at an End; The Sense
of the Favour, <HI>I say,</HI> which I had done him,
and was still doing him, in the civil Treat∣ment
which I gave him, made this Gentle∣man
for such he was in himself, and in his
Disposition, whatever he was by Family, for
that I knew nothing of; I say, it made him
<PB N="52" REF="263"/>
exceeding importunate with me, and with
my Doctor, who spoke <HI>Spanish</HI> perfectly well
to go with him to <HI>Villa Rica.</HI></P>
<P>I made him no Promise, but talked at a
Distance; I told him, If he had lived by the
Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and I could have sailed to his Door, it
my Ship, I would have made him a Visit
He returned, That he wished he could mak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the River of <HI>Baldivia</HI> Navigable for me, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I might bring my Ship up to his Door, and
he would venture to say, That neither me
nor all my Ship's Company, should starv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
while we were with him. In the Interva
of these Discourses, I asked my Doctor hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Opinion, Whether he thought I might trus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this <HI>Spaniard,</HI> if I had a Mind to go up and
see the Country for a few Days?</P>
<P><HI>Seignior,</HI> says he, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
some Respects, the worst Nation under th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Sun; They are cruel, inexorable, uncharitable
voracious, and, in several Cases, treacherous
but in Two Things, they are to be depended
upon beyond all the Nations in the World
that is to say, When they give their Honou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to perform any thing; and when they hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Return to make for any Favour received
and here he entertained me with a long Stor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of a Merchant of <HI>Chartagena,</HI> who, in a Sloop
was Shipwreck'd at Sea, and was taken u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by an <HI>English</HI> Merchant, on Board a Shi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
bound to <HI>London</HI> from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> or some
other of our Islands; That the <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chant,
meeting another <HI>English</HI> Ship boun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> put the <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchant o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Board him, paid him for his Passage, and
<PB N="53" REF="264"/>
obliged him to set him on Shore on the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Coast, as near to <HI>Chartogena</HI> as he could.
This <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchant could never rest 'till
he found Means to Ship himself from <HI>Charta∣gena</HI>
to the <HI>Havana,</HI> on the <HI>Galleons;</HI> from
thence to <HI>Cadiz</HI> in <HI>Old-Spain;</HI> and from thence
to <HI>London,</HI> to find out the <HI>English</HI> Merchant,
and make him a Present to the Value of a
Thousand Pistoles, for saving his Life, and
for his civil returning him to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> &amp;c.
Whether the Story was true or not, his Infer∣ence
from it, was just; namely, That a <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>
never forgot a Kindness; But take it
withal, says the Doctor, that I believe 'tis
as much the Effect of their Pride, as of their
Virtue; for at the same Time, said he, they
never forget an ill Turn, any more than they
do a good one; and they frequently intail their
Enmities on their Families, and prosecute the
Revenge from one Generation to another; so
that the Heir has, with the Estate of his An∣cestors,
all the Family Broils upon his Hands
as he comes to his Estate.</P>
<P>From all this he inferred, That as this <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>
found himself so very much obliged to
me, I might depend upon it, that he had so
much Pride in him, that if he could pull
down the <HI>Andes</HI> for me to go through, and
I wanted it, he would do it for me; and that
nothing would be a greater Satisfaction to
him, than to find some way or other how to
requite me.</P>
<P>All these Discourses shortned our Voyage,
and we arrived fair and softly (for it was
very good Weather, and little Wind) at <HI>Tuca∣pel,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="265"/>
or the River <HI>Imperial,</HI> within Ten Leagues
of <HI>Baldivia,</HI> that is to say, Of <HI>Cape Bonisacio,</HI>
which is the <HI>North</HI> Point of the Entrance into
the River of <HI>Baldivia;</HI> and here I took one
of the most unaccountable, and, I must needs
acknowledge, unjustifiable Resolutions, that
ever any Commander, intrusted with a
Ship of such Force, and a Cargo of such
Consequence, adventured upon before; and
which I, by no means, recommend to any
Commander of a Ship to imitate; and this
was, To venture up into the Country above
One hundred and Fifty Miles from my Ship,
leaving the Success of the whole Voyage, the
Estates of my Employers, and the richest
Ship and Cargo, that ever came out of those
Seas, to the Care and Fidelity of Two or
Three Men. Such was the unsatisfied Thirst
of New Discoveries, which I brought out of
<HI>England</HI> with me, and which I nourish'd at
all Hazards, to the End of the Voyage.</P>
<P>However, though I condemn myself, in
the main, for the Rashness of the Undertak∣ing,
yet let me do myself so much Justice,
as to leave it on Record too, That I did not
run this Risque without all the needful
Precautions for the Safety of the Ship and
Cargo.</P>
<P>And, first, I found out a safe Place for the
Ships to ride; and this, neither in the River
of <HI>Tucapel,</HI> nor in the River of <HI>Baldivia,</HI> but
in an Opening or Inlet of Water without a
Name, about a League to the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Tuca∣pel,</HI>
embayed and secured from almost all
the Winds that could blow: Here the Ships
<PB N="55" REF="266"/>
lay easy, with Water enough, having about
Eleven, Fathoms good holding Ground, and
about half a League from Shore.</P>
<P>I left the <HI>Supra-Cargo,</HI> and my chief Mate,
also a Kinsman of my own, a true Sailor, who
had been a Midship-man, but was now a
Lieutenant: I say, To those I left the Com∣mand
of both my Ships, but with express
Orders not to stir, nor unmoo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, upon any Ac∣count
whatever, Life and Death excepted,
'till my Return; or 'till, if I was dead, they
heard what was become of me; no, though
they were to stay there Six Months, for they
had Provisions enough, and an excellent Place
for watering lay just by them; and I made
all the Men swear to me, that they would
make no Mutiny or Disorder, but obey my
said Kinsman in one Ship, and the <HI>Supra-Cargo</HI>
in the other, in all Things, except re∣moving
from that Place; and that if they
should command them to stir from thence,
they would not so much as touch a Sail or a
Rope.</P>
<P>When I had made all these Conditions,
and told my Men, That the Design I went
upon, was for the Good of their Voyage, for the
Service of the Owners, and should, if it suc∣ceeded,
be for all their Advantages; I asked
them, If they were all willing I should go?
to which they all answered, That they were
very willing, and would take the same Care
of the Ships, and of all Things belonging to
them, as if I were on Board. This encou∣raged
me greatly, and I now resolved nothing
should hinder me.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="267"/>
Having thus concluded every thing, then
and not 'till then, I told my <HI>Spaniard,</HI> Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I had almost resolved to go along with him;
at which he appeared exceedingly pleased,
and, indeed, in a Surprize of Joy. I should
have told you, That before I told him this,
I had set all the rest of the Prisoners on Shore,
at their own Request, just between the Port
of <HI>Tucapel,</HI> and the Bay of the <HI>Conception,</HI>
except Two Men, who, as he told me, liv'd
in the Open Country beyond <HI>Baldivia,</HI> and, as
he observed, were very glad to be set on Shore
with him, so to travel home, having lost what
little they had in the Ship, and to whom he
communicated nothing of all the Discourse we
had had of the Affair of the Mountains.</P>
<P>I also dismissed now the Two <HI>Chilian Indi∣an,</HI>
but not without a very good Reward,
proportioned to, not their Trouble and Time
only, but proportioned to what I seemed to
expect of them, and filling them still with
Expectations, that I would come again, and
take a Journey with them into the Moun∣tains.</P>
<P>And now it became necessary, that I should
use the utmost Freedom with my new Friend
the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> being, as I told him, to put
my Life in his Hands, and the Prosperity of
my whole Adventure, both Ship and Ship's
Company.</P>
<P>He told me, He was sensible that I did
put my Life in his Hands, and that it was
a very great Token of Confidence in him,
even such a one, that he, being a Stranger to
me, had no Reason to expect; but he de∣sired
<PB N="57" REF="268"/>
me to consider, that he was a <HI>Christian,</HI>
not a <HI>Savage;</HI> That he was one, I had laid
the highest Obligation upon, in voluntarily
taking him out of the Hands of the Free∣booters,
where he might have lost his Life;
And, in the next Place, he said, It was some
Argument, that he was a Gentleman, and
that I should find him to be a Man of Ho∣nour;
and, lastly, That it did not appear,
that he could make any Advantage of me,
or that he could get any thing by using me
ill; and if even that was no Argument, yet I
should find, when I came to his House, that
he was not in a Condition to want any
thing, that might be gained, so much as to
procure it by such a Piece of Villainy and Trea∣chery,
as to betray and destroy the Man that
had sav'd his Life, and brought him out of
the Hands of the Devil, safe to his Country
and Family, when he might have been car∣ried
away, God knows whither. But, to con∣clude
all, He desired me to accept the Offer
he had made me at Sea (<HI>viz.</HI>) That he would
send for his Two Sons, and leave them on
Board the Ship as Hostages for my Safety,
and desired they might be used on Board
no otherwise than I was used with him in
the Country.</P>
<P>I was ashamed to accept such an Offer as
this; but he pressed it earnestly, and im∣portuned
the Doctor to move me to accept
it, telling him, That he should not be easy
if I did not; so that, in short, the Doctor ad∣vised
me to agree to it; and accordingly he
hired a Messenger and a Mule, and sent away
<PB N="58" REF="269"/>
for his Two Sons to come to him; and suel
Expedition the Messenger made, that in Six
Days he returned with the Two Sons, and
Three Servants, all on Horseback. His Two
Sons were very pretty well behaved Youths,
who appeared to be Gentlemen in their very
Countenances; the Eldest was about Thir∣teen
Years old, and the other about Ele∣ven.
I treated them on Board, as I had done
their Father, with all possible Respect; and
having entertained them Two Days, left
Order, that they should be treated in the
same Manner when I was gone; and to this
I added aloud (that their Father might hear
it) That whenever they had a Mind to go
away, they should let them go: But their
Father laid a great many solemn Charges
upon them, that they should not stir out of
the Ship 'till I came back safe; and that I gave
them leave; and he made them promise, that
they would not; and the young Gentlemen
kept their Word so punctually, that when
our <HI>Supra-Cargo,</HI> who I left in Command,
offered to let them go on Shore several Times,
to divert them with Shooting and Hunting,
they would not stir out of the Ship, and did
not, 'till I came back again.</P>
<P>Having gone this Length, and made every
thing ready for my Adventure, we set out,
Captain <HI>Merlote,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Doctor, the old
Mutineer, that was my Second Mate, and
who was now the Captain of the <HI>Madagascar</HI>
Ship, and myself, with Two Midship-men,
who we took as Servants, but who I resolved
to make the Directors of the main Enterprize.
<PB REF="270"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="59" REF="271"/>
As to the Number, I found my <HI>Spaniard</HI> made
no Scruple of that, if it had been half my
Ship's Company.</P>
<P>We set out, some on Horses, and some on
Mules, as we could get them, but the <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>
and myself rode on Two very good
Horses, being the same that his Two Sons
came on. We arrived at a Noble Country Seat
about a League short of the Town, where,
at first, I thought we had been only to put
in for Refreshment; but I soon found, that
it was really his Dwelling-House, and where
his Family and Servants resided.</P>
<P>Here we were received like Princes, and
with as much Ceremony as if he had been
a Prince that entertained us: The <HI>Mayor Domo,</HI>
or Steward of his House, received us, took
in our Baggage, and ordered our Two Ser∣vants
to be taken care of.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> did
all, that Pride and Oftentation was capa∣ble
of inspiring him with, to entertain us;
and the Truth is, He could not have lived in
a Country in the World more capable of gra∣tifying
his Pride; for here, without any
thing uncommon, he was able to shew more
Gold Plate, than many good Families, in
our Country, have of Silver; and as for Sil∣ver,
it quite eclipses the Appearance, or ra∣ther
took away the very use of Pewter, of
which, we did not see one Vessel, no, not in
the meanest Part of his House: It is true, I
believe, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had not a Piece of Plate,
or of any Houshold Furniture, which we did
not see, except what belonged to the Apart∣ment
<PB N="60" REF="272"/>
of his Wife; and it is to be observed.
That the Women never appeared, except at
a Distance, and in the Gardens, and then
being under Veils, we could not know the
Lady from her Women, or the Maids from
the Mistress.</P>
<P>We were lodged every one in separate
Apartments, very well furnished, but Two
of them very nobly, indeed; though all the
Materials for Furniture must be there at an
excessive Price. The way of lodging upon
Quilts, and in Beds, made <HI>Pavillion</HI>-wise, after
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Custom, I need not describe; but
it surprized me to see the Rooms hung with
very rich Tapestries, in a Part of the World
where they must cost so dear.</P>
<P>We had <HI>Chilian</HI> Wine served us up in round
Gold Cups, and Water in large Silver Decan∣ters,
that held, at least, Five Quarts a Piece,
these stood in our Chamber. Our Chocolate
was brought us up in the same Manner, in
deep Cups, all of Gold, and it was made in
Vessels all of Silver.</P>
<P>It would be troublesome to the very Rea∣der,
to interrupt my Account with the Rela∣tion
of all the fine Things he had in his House,
and I could not be persuaded, but that he had
borrowed all the Plate in the Town to fur∣nish
out his Side-board and Table; but my
Doctor told me, It was nothing but what was
very usual among them that were Men of
any Substance, as it was apparent he was;
and that the Silver-Smiths at St. <HI>Jago</HI> sup∣plied
them generally with their Plate ready
wrought, in Exchange (with Allowanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for
<PB N="61" REF="273"/>
the Quality) for the Gold which they found
in the Mountains, or in the Brooks and
Streams which came from the Mountains,
into which the hasty Showers of Winter Rain
frequently washed down pretty large Lumps;
and others, which were smaller, they washed
out of the Sands by the ordinary Methods
of washing of Oar.</P>
<P>I was better satisfied in this Particular,
when, the next Day, talking to our new Land∣lord
about the Mountains, and the Wealth of
them, I asked him, If he could shew me any
of the Gold which was usually washed out
of the Hills by the Rain, in the natural Fi∣gure
in which it was found? He smiled, and
told me Yes, he would shew us a little; and
with that, carried us up into a kind of a
Closet, where he had a great Variety of odd
Things, gathered up about the Mountains and
Rivers, such as fine Shells, strange Stones in
the Form of Stars, heavy Pieces of Oar, but
such as neither he, or any of us, could tell
what they were, and the like; and after this,
he pulled out a great Leather Bag, which had,
I believe, near Fifty Pounds weight in it, Here,
<HI>Seignior,</HI> says he, here is some of the Dirt
of the Earth, and turning it out upon the
Table, it was easy to see that it was all Gold,
though the Pieces were of different Forms,
and some scarce looking like Gold at all, being
so mixed with the Sparr, or with Earth, that
it did not appear so plain; but in every bit,
there was something of the clear Gold to be
seen, and the smaller the Lumps, the purer
the Gold appeared.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="274"/>
I was surprized at the Quantity, more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at the Thing itself, having, as I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
said, seen the Gold which the <HI>Indians</HI> foun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in the Countries I have described, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
seemed to have little or no Mixture; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
then I was to have considered, That wha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
those <HI>Indians</HI> gathered, was farther from the
Hills which it came from, and that those
rough, irregular Pieces would not drive s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
far in the Water, but would lodge themselves
in the Earth and Sand of the Rivers nearer
home; and also, that the <HI>Indians,</HI> not know∣ing
how to separate the Gold by Fire from
the Dross and Mixture above, did not think
those rough Pieces worth their taking up,
whereas the <HI>Spaniards</HI> here understood much
better, what they were about.</P>
<P>But to return to the Closet; When he had
shewn us this Leather Pouch full, he sweeps
it by to one Side of the Table, which had
Ledges round it, to keep it from running off,
and takes up another Bag full of large Pieces
of Stone, great Lumps of Earth, and Pieces
of various Shapes, all of which had some
Gold in them, but not to be gotten out but
by Fire: These, he told us, their Servants
bring them home as they find them in the
Mountains, lying loose here and there, when
they run after their Cattle.</P>
<P>But still I asked him, If they found no
Pieces of pure Gold? upon this, he turned to a
great old Cabinet full of pretty large Drawers,
and pulling out one Drawer, he shewed us a
surprizing Number of Pieces, of pure clean
Gold, some round, some long, some flat, some
<PB N="63" REF="275"/>
thick, all of irregular Shapes, and worked
roundish at the Ends, with rolling along, some
of these weighed a quarter of an Ounce, some
more, and some less, and as I lifted the
Drawer, I believe there could not be less than
between Twenty and Thirty Pound weight
of it.</P>
<P>Then he pulled out another Drawer, which
was almost full of the same kind of
Drug, but as small as Sand, the biggest not
so big as Pins Heads, and which might very
properly be called Gold Dust.</P>
<P>After this Sight, a Man was to be surpriz'd
at nothing he could see; I ask'd him, How
long such a Treasure might be amassing toge∣ther
in this Country? He told me, That was
according to the Pains they might take in the
Search; That he had been Twelve Years here,
and had done little or nothing; but had he
had Twenty Negroes to have set on Work, as
he might have had, he might have had more
than this in one Year. I ask'd him, How
much Gold in Weight he thought there might
be in all this he had shewn me? he told me,
He could not tell; That they never troubled
themselves to weigh, but when the Silver∣smith
at St. <HI>Jago</HI> came to bring home any
Vessel, or, when the Merchants from
<HI>Lima</HI> came to <HI>Baldivia</HI> with <HI>European</HI> Goods,
then they bought what they wanted of them;
That they were sensible they gave excessive
dear for every Thing, even Ten or Twenty for
One: But as Gold, he said, was the Growth of
that Country, and the other Things, such as
Cloth, Linnen, sine Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were the Gold
<PB N="64" REF="276"/>
of <HI>Europe,</HI> they did not think much to giv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
what they ask'd for those Things. In short
I found, that the People in this Country
though they kept large Plantations in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r
Hands, had great Numbers of Cattle, <HI>Ingenios</HI>
as they call them, for making Sugar, and
Land, under Management, for the Maintenanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
of themselves and Families; yet did no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
wholly neglect the getting Gold out of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
Mountains, where it was in such Plenty; and
therefore it seems the Town adjacent is called
<HI>Villa Rica,</HI> or <HI>The Rich Town,</HI> being seated, as it
were, at the Foot of the Mountains, and in
the richest part of them.</P>
<P>After I had sufficiently admir'd the vast
Quantity of Gold he had, he made Signs to
the Doctor, That I should take any Piece or
any Quantity that I pleased; but thought<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I might take it as an Affront, to have him offer
me any particular small Parcel. The Doctor
hinted it to me, and I bad him return him
Thanks; but to let him know, that I would by
no Means have any of that, but that I would be
glad to take up a Piece or Two, such as Chance
should present to me in the Mountains; that
I might shew in my own Country, and tell
them, that I took it up with my own Hands:
He answer'd, He would go with me himself;
and doubted not, but to carry me where I
should fully satisfy my Curiosity, if I would
be content to clamber a little among the
Rocks.</P>
<P>I now began to see plainly, that I had no
manner of Need to have taken his Sons for Ho∣stages,
for my Safety; and would sain have
<PB N="65" REF="277"/>
sent for them back again; but he would by
no Means give me Leave; so I was oblig'd
to give that over. A Day or two after, I de∣sir'd
of him, That he would give me Leave
to send for one Person more from the Ships,
who I had a great Mind should see the
Country with me, and to send for some few
Things that I should want, and, withal, to
satisfy my Men, that I was safe and well.</P>
<P>This he consented to; so I sent away one of
the two Midship-Men, who I call'd my Servants,
and with him Two Servants of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
my Landlord, as I call'd him, with Four
Mules and Two Horses: I gave my Mid∣ship-Man
my Orders and Directions under
my Hand, to my <HI>Supra-Cargo</HI> what to do; for
I was resolv'd to be even with my <HI>Spaniard</HI>
for all his good Usage of me; the Midship-Man
was gone Ten Days, for they came back
pretty well laden, as you shall hear, and the
Men were oblig'd to come all on Foot.</P>
<P>All the while they were gone, my Landlord
and I spent in surveying the Country, and
viewing his Plantation: As for the City of
<HI>Villa Rica,</HI> it was not the most proper to go
there in Publick; and the Doctor knew that
as well as the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and therefore, tho'
we went several Times <HI>incognito,</HI> yet it was
of no Consequence to me, neither did I de∣sire
it.</P>
<P>One Night I had a very strange Fright here<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and behav'd myself very much like a Fool about
it: The Case was this; I wak'd in the Middle
of the Night, and chancing to open my Eyes,
I saw a great Light of Fire, which to me
<PB N="66" REF="278"/>
seem'd as if the House, or some Part of it, had
been on Fire; I, as if I had been at <HI>Wapping</HI> or
<HI>Rotherhith,</HI> where People are always terrify'd
with such Things, jump'd out of Bed, and
call'd my Friend Captain <HI>Merlote,</HI> and cry'd
out, Fire, Fire! The first Thing I should have
thought of, on this Occasion, should have
been, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> did not understand
what the Words Fire, Fire! meant; and, that
if I expected they should understand me, I
should, have cry'd <HI>Fuego, Fuego!</HI></P>
<P>However, Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> got up, and
my <HI>Madegascar</HI> Captain, for we all lay near
one another, and with the Noise they waked
the whole House; and my Landlord, as he af∣terwards
confess'd, began to suspect some Mis∣chief;
his Steward having come to his Cham∣ber-Door,
and told him, that the Strangers
were up in Arms; in which Mistake we might
all have had our Throats cut, and the poor
<HI>Spaniard</HI> not to blame neither.</P>
<P>But our Doctor coming hastily in to me,
unriddled the whole Matter, which was this,
That a Volcano, or Burning Vent among the
Hills, being pretty near the <HI>Spanish</HI> Side of the
Country, as there are many of them in the
<HI>Andes,</HI> had flam'd out that Night, and gave
such a terrible Light in the Air, as made us
think the Fire had at least been in the Out-Houses,
or in part of the House, and according∣ly
had put me in such a Fright.</P>
<P>Upon this, having told me what it was,
he ran away to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Servants, and
told them what the Meaning of it all was;
and bad them go and satisfy their Master,
<PB N="67" REF="279"/>
which they did; and all was well again; but
as for me, I sat almost all the Night staring
out at Window at the Eruption of Fire upon
the Hills, and the like Bonfire I had never
seen before, I assure you.</P>
<P>I sincerely begg'd my Landlord's Pardon for
disturbing his House; and ask'd him, If those
Eruptions were frequent? he said, No, they
were not frequent, for they were constant, ei∣ther
in one Part of the Hills or another; and
that in my passing the Mountains I should
see several of them. I ask'd him, If they
were not alarm'd with them? and if they
were not attended with Earthquakes? He
said, He believ'd that among the Hills them∣selves,
they might have some Shakings of the
Earth, because sometimes they should find
Pieces of the Rocks break off, and fall
down; and that it was among those little
Fractures that sometimes Pieces of Stone were
found which had Gold interspers'd in them, as
if they had been melted and run together; of
which he had shewn me some: But that as
for Earthquakes in the Country, he had ne∣ver
heard of any, since he came thither,
which had been upwards of Fifteen Years,
including Three Years that he dwelt at
<HI>St. Jago.</HI></P>
<P>One Day, being out on Horseback with
my Landlord, we rode up close to the Moun∣tains,
and he shew'd me at a Distance an
Entrance, as he call'd it, into them, fright∣ful
enough indeed; as you shall hear in its
Place: Then he told me, That was the Way
he intended to carry me when he should go to
<PB N="68" REF="280"/>
shew me the highest Hills in the World: But
he turn'd short, and, smiling, said, It shoul
not be yet; for tho' he had promised me a
safe Return, and left Hostages for it, yet he
had not capitulated for Time.</P>
<P>I told him, He need not capitulate with
me for Time; for if I had not Two Ships
to stay my Coming, and between Three and
Four Hundred Men eating me up all the
while, I did not know whether I wou'd ever
go away again, or no, if he would give me
House-room. He told me, As to that, he
had sent my Men some Victuals, so that they
wou'd not starve if I did not come back for
some Days. This surpriz'd me a little, and I
discovered it in my Countenance. Nay, Seig∣nior,
says he, I have only sent them some
Victuals to maintain my Two Hostages; for,
you know, they must not want. It was
not Good-Manners in me to ask what he had
sent; but I understood, as soon as my Mid∣ship-man
return'd, that he had sent down
Sixteen Cows or Runts, I know not what to
call them, but black Cattle; Thirty Hogs,
Thirteen large <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, as big as
great Calves; and Three <HI>Casks</HI> of <HI>Chilian</HI>
Wine, with an Assurance, that they should
have more Provisions when that was spent.</P>
<P>I was amaz'd at all this Munificence of
the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and very glad I was, that I had
sent my Midship-man for the Things I in∣tended
to present him again; for I was as
well able to requite him for a large Present as
he was to make it, and had resolv'd it be∣fore
I knew he had sent any Thing to the
<PB N="69" REF="281"/>
Ship; so that this exchanging of Presents
was but a kind of generous Barter or Com∣merce:
For as to Gold, we had either of us
so much, that it was not at all equal in Va∣lue
to what we had to give on both Sides,
as we were at present stated.</P>
<P>In short, my Midship-man return'd with
the Horses and Servants; and when we had
brought what I had sent for into a Place
which I desired the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to allow me to
open my Things in, I sent my Doctor to de∣sire
the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to let me speak with him.</P>
<P>I told him, first, That he must give me
his Parole of Honour not to take amiss what
I had to say to him; That it was the Cu∣stom
in our Country, at any Time, to make
Presents to the Ladies, with the Knowledge
and Consent of their Husbands or Parents,
without any evil Design, or without giving
any Offence; but that I knew it was not
so among the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> That I had not had
the Honour yet either to see his Lady or his
Daughter, but that I had heard he had a
Lady and a Daughter also: However, that
if he pleas'd; to be the Messenger of a Tri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le
I had caus'd my Man to bring, and would
present it for me, and not take it as an Of∣fence,
he should see before-hand what it was,
and I would content my self with his accept∣ing
it in their Behalf.</P>
<P>He told me, smiling, He did not bring
me thither to take any Presents of me; I
had already done enough, in that I had gi∣ven
him his Liberty, which was the most
valuable Gift in the World; and as to his
<PB N="70" REF="282"/>
Wife, I had already made her the best Pre∣sent
I was able, having given her back her
Husband; That it is true, it was not the Cu∣stom
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to let their Wives ap∣pear
in any publick Entertainment of Friends,
but that he had resolv'd to break through
that Custom; and that he had told his Wife,
What a Friend I had been to her Family,
and that she should thank me for it in Pub∣lick;
and that then, what Present I had de∣sign'd
for her, since I would be a Maker of
Presents, she should do herself the Honour
to take it with her own Hands, and he
wou'd be very far from mistaking them, or
taking it ill from his Wife.</P>
<P>As this was the highest Compliment he
was able to make me, the more he was
obliging in the Manner; for he returned in
about Two Hours, leading his Wife into the
Room by the Hand, and his Daughter fol∣lowing.</P>
<P>I must confess I was surpriz'd, for I did
not expect to have seen such a Sight in <HI>Ame∣rica.</HI>
The Lady's Dress indeed I cannot de∣scribe,
but she was really a charming Wo∣man
in her Person, of about Forty Years
of Age, and cover'd over with Emeralds and
Diamonds, I mean, as to her Head. She
was veil'd till she came into the Room, but
gave her Veil to her Woman when her Hus∣band
took her by the Hand. Her Daughter
I took to be about Twelve Years old, which
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> count Marriageable; She was
pretty, but not so handsome as her Mo∣ther.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="283"/>
After the Compliments on both Sides,
my Landlord, as I now call him, told her
very handsomely what a Benefactor I had been
to her Family, by redeeming him from
the Hands of Villains: And she, turning to
me, thank'd me in the most obliging Man∣ner,
and with a modest graceful Way of
Speech, such as I cannot represent, and which,
indeed, I did not think the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
are said to be so haughty, had been acquaint∣ed
with.</P>
<P>I then desired the Doctor to tell the <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>
her Husband, That I desir'd his Lady
to accept a small Present which my Midship-man
had brought for her from the Ship, and
which, <HI>with his Words,</HI> I took in my Hand,
and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> led his Wife on to take it:
And I must needs say, It was not a mean
Present, besides, its being of Ten Times
the Value in that Place, as it would have
been at <HI>London,</HI> and I was now very glad
that, as I mentioned above, I always re∣served
a small Quantity of all Sorts of Goods
unsold, that I might have them to dispose of
as Occasion should offer.</P>
<P>First, I presented her with a very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine
Piece of <HI>Dutch</HI> Holland, worth, in <HI>London,</HI>
about Seven Shillings an Ell, and Thirty-six
Ells in Length, and worth in <HI>Chili,</HI> to be sure,
Fifteen Pieces of Eight <HI>per</HI> Ell, at least; or it
was rather likely, that all the Kingdom of
<HI>Chili</HI> had not such another.</P>
<P>Then I gave her Two Pieces of <HI>China</HI> Da∣mask,
and Two Pieces of <HI>China</HI> Silks called
Atlasses, flowered with Gold; Two Pieces of
<PB N="72" REF="284"/>
fine Muslin, one flower'd, the other plain,
and a Piece of very fine Chints, or printed
Callicoe; also a large Parcel of Spices, made
up in blue Papers, being about Six Pounds of
Nutmegs, and about twice as many Cloves.</P>
<P>And, lastly, To the young Lady I gave
One Piece of Damask, Two Pieces of <HI>China</HI>
Taffity, and a Piece of fine striped Muslin.</P>
<P>After all this was delivered, and the La∣dies
had received them, and given them their
Women to hold, I pulled out a little Box,
in which I had Two Couple of large Pearls,
of that Pearl which I mentioned we found at
the Pearl Islands, very well matched for Ear∣rings,
and gave the Lady one Pair, and the
Daughter the other; And now, I think, I had
made a Present <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it for an Ambassador to carry
to a Prince.</P>
<P>The Ladies made all possible Acknowledg∣ment,
and we had the Honour that Day to
dine with them in Publick. My Landlord,
the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> told me, I had given them such
a Present, as the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico</HI>'s Lady
would have gone Fifty Leagues to have re∣ceived.</P>
<P>But I had not done with my Host; for,
after Dinner, I took him into the same Room,
and told him, I hoped he did not think I
had made all my Presents to the Ladies, and
had nothing left to shew my Respect to him;
and, therefore, first I presented him with
Three Negroe-men, which I had bought at
<HI>Callao</HI> for my own Use, but knew I could sup∣ply
myself again at or in my way home,
at a moderate Price; in the next Place, I
<PB N="73" REF="285"/>
gave him Three Pieces of Black <HI>Colchester</HI>
Bays, which, though they are coarse ordi∣nary
Things in <HI>England,</HI> that a Footman
would scarce wear, are a Habit for a Prince
in that Country; I then gave him a Piece of
very fine Scarlet <HI>English</HI> Serge, which was
really very valuable in <HI>England,</HI> but much
more there; and another Piece of Crimson
Broad-Cloth, and Six Pieces of fine Silk Drug∣gets
for his Two Sons, and thus I finished
my Presents. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> stood still, and
looked on all the while I was laying out my
Presents to him, as one in a Transport, and
said not one Word 'till all was over; But then
he told me very gravely, That it was now
time for him to turn me out of his House;
For, Seignior, says he, no Man ought to suf∣fer
himself to be obliged beyond his Power
of Return, and I have no possible way of mak∣ing
any Return to you equal to such Things
as these.</P>
<P>It is true, the Present I had made him, if
it was to be rated by the Value of Things
in the Country where it then was, would
have been valued at Six or Seven hundred
Pounds Sterling, but to rekon them as they
might cost me, did not all together amount to
above One hundred Pounds, except the Three
Negroes, which, indeed, cost me at <HI>Lima</HI> One
thousand Two hundred Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>He was as sensible of the Price of those Ne∣groes,
as I was of the Occasion he had of them,
and of the Work he had to do for them; and
he came to me about an Hour after, and
told me, He had looked over all the Particu∣lars
<PB N="74" REF="286"/>
of the noble Presents which I had made
them; and though the Value was too great
for him to accept, or for any Man to offer
him, yet, since I had been at so much Trou∣ble
to send for the Things, and that I thought
him worthy such a Bounty, he was come
back to tell me, That he accepted, thankfully,
all my Presents, both to himself, and to his
Wife and Daughter, except only the Three
Negroes, and as they were bought in the
Country, and were the particular Traffick of
the Place, he could not take them as a Pre∣sent;
but would be equally obliged, and take
It for as much a Favour, if I would allow
him to pay for them.</P>
<P>I smiled, and told him, He and I would
agree upon that; for he did not yet know
what Favours I had to ask of him, and what
Expence I should put him to; That I had a
great Design in my View, which I was to
crave his Assistance in, and which I had not
yet communicated to him, in which he
might, perhaps, find, that he would pay dear
enough for all the little Presents I had made
him; and, in the mean time, to make him∣self
easy as to the Three Negroe-men, I gave
him my Word, that he should pay for them;
only not yet.</P>
<P>He could have nothing to object against an
Offer of this kind, because he could not guess
what I meant; but gave me all the Assur∣ances
of Service and Assistance that lay in his
Power, in any thing that I might have to do
in that Country.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="287"/>
But here, by the way, you are to under∣stand,
that all this was carry'd on with a
Supposition, that we acted under a Com∣mission
from the King of <HI>France;</HI> and though
he knew many of us were <HI>English,</HI> and that
I was an <HI>Englishman</HI> in particular, yet, as
we had such a Commission, and produced it,
we were <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> in that Sense, to him,
nor did he entertain us upon any other
Foot.</P>
<P>The Sequel of the Story will also make it
sufficiently appear, That I did not make
such Presents as these in meer Ostentation,
or only upon the Compliment of a Visit to
a <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentleman, any more than I would
leave my Ship, and a Cargo of such Value,
in the manner I had done, to make a Tour
into the Country, if had not had Views suf∣ficient
to justify such Beginnings; and the
Consequence of these Things, will be the best
Apology for me, to those who shall have Pa∣tience
to put them all together.</P>
<P>We had now spent a Fortnight, and some∣thing
more, in Ceremony and Civilities, and
in, now and then, taking a little Tour about
the Fields, and towards the Mountains.
However, even in this way of living, I was
not so idle as I seemed to be, for I not only
made due Observations of all the Country
which I saw, but informed myslef sufficiently
of the Parts which I did not see. I found the
Country not only fruitful in the Soil, but
wonderful temperate and agreeable in its Cli∣mate.
The Air, though hot, according to
its proper Latitude, yet that Heat so mo∣derated
<PB N="76" REF="288"/>
by the cool Breezes from the Moun∣tains,
that it was rather equal to the plai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
Countries in other Parts of the World, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
the Latitude of Fifty, than to a Climate i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
Thirty-eight to Forty Degrees.</P>
<P>This gave the Inhabitants the Advantages
not only of pleasant and agreeable living

to Corn, the most necessary of all Productions
such as Wheat, I mean <HI>European</HI> Wheat, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
<HI>English</HI> Wheat, which grew here as well and
as kindly, as in <HI>England;</HI> which in <HI>Peru</HI>
and in the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> will by n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
means thrive for want of Moisture and
Cold.</P>
<P>Here were, also, an excellent middling
Breed of Black Cattle, which they fed un∣der
the Shade of the Mountains, and on the
Banks of the Rivers, 'till they came to be
very fat. In a Word, here were, or might
be produced, all the Plants, Fruits, and
Grain, of a temperate Climate. At the same
Time, the Orange, Limon, Citron, Pome∣grenate,
and Figs, with a moderate Care,
would come to a very tolerable Perfection
in their Gardens; and even Sugar-Canes, in
some Places, though these last but rarely, and
not without great Art in the Cultivation, and
chiefly in Gardens.</P>
<P>They assured me, That farther <HI>Southward</HI>
beyond <HI>Baldivia,</HI> and to the Latitude of For∣ty-seven
to Forty-nine, the Lands were
esteemed richer than where we now were;
the Grass more strengthening and nourishing
<PB N="77" REF="289"/>
for the Cattle; and that, consequently, the
Black Cattle, Horses, and Hogs, were all of
a larger Breed; but that, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
had no Settlement beyond <HI>Baldivia</HI> to the
<HI>South,</HI> so they did not find the Natives so
tractable as where we then were; where,
though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were but few, and the
Strength they had, was but small, yet, as
upon any Occasion, they had always been
assisted with Forces sufficient from St. <HI>Jago,</HI>
and, if need were, even from <HI>Peru,</HI> so the
Natives had always been subdued, and had
found themselves obliged to submit; and
that now they were intirely reduced, and
were, and had been, for several Years, very
easy and quiet: Besides the plentiful Harvest
which they made of Gold from the Moun∣tains
(which appeared to be the great Allure∣ment
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) had drawn them ra∣ther
to settle here, than farther <HI>Southward,</HI>
being naturally addicted, as my new Land∣lord
confessed to me, to reap the Harvest
which had the least Labour and Hazard at∣tending
it, and the most Profit.</P>
<P>Not but that, at the same Time, he con∣fessed,
That he believed, and had heard, that
there was as much Gold to be found farther
to the <HI>South,</HI> as far as the Mountains conti∣nued;
but that, as I have said, the Natives
were more troublesome, and more dangerous,
than where they now lived; and that the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> did not allow Troops sufficient
to civilize and reduce them.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="290"/>
I asked him concerning the Natives in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
Country where we were? he told me, The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
were the most quiet, and inoffensive People
since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had reduced them by Force
that could be desired; That they were not
indeed, Numerous, or Warlike, the Warlike
and Obstinate Part of them having fled far
ther off to the <HI>South,</HI> as they were overpower∣ed
by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> That for those that were
left, they lived secure, under the Protection
of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governor; That they fed Cattle,
and planted the Country, and sold the Pro∣duct
of their Lands very much to the <HI>Spa∣niards;</HI>
but that they did not covet to be
rich, only to obtain Cloaths, Arms, Powder
and Shot; which, however, they let them
have but sparingly, and with good Assurance
of their Fidelity. I asked him, If they were
not treacherous and persidious? And if it
was not dangerous trusting themselves among
them in the Mountains, and among the re∣tired
Places where they dwelt? he told me,
That it was quite the contrary; that they
were so honest, and so harmless, that he
would at any Time venture to send his Two
Sons into the Mountains a Hunting, with
each of them a <HI>Chilian</HI> for his Guide, and let
them stay with the said Natives Two or
Three Nights and Days at a Time, and be
in no Uneasiness about them; and that none
of them were ever known to do any foul or
treacherous thing by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> since he
had been in that Country.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="291"/>
Having thus fully informed myself of
Things, I began now to think it was high
Time to see the main Sight which I came to
enquire after (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Passages of the Moun∣tains,
and the Wonders that were to be dis∣covered
on the other Side; and accordingly
I took my Patron the <HI>Spaniard</HI> by himself,
and told him, That as I was a Traveller, and
was now in such a remote Part of the World,
he could not but think I should be glad to see
every thing extraordinary, that was to be
seen; that I might be able to give some Ac∣count
of the World when I came into <HI>Europe,</HI>
better, and differing from what others had
done, who had been there before me; and
that I had a great mind, if he would give
me his Assistance, to enter into the Passages
and Valleys which he had told me so much
of in the Mountains, and, if it was possible,
<HI>which, indeed, I had always thought it was not,</HI>
to take a Prospect of the World on the other
Side.</P>
<P>He told me, It was not a light Piece of
Work, and, perhaps, the Discoveries might
not answer my Trouble, there being little to
be seen but steep Precipices, unhospitable
Rocks, and unpassable Mountains, immuring
us on every Side, innumerable Rills and
Brooks of Water falling from the Clifts,
making a barbarous and unpleasant Sound;
and that Sound eccho'd and reverberated from
innumerable Cavities and Hollows among
the Rocks, and these all pouring down into
one Middle Stream, which we should always
find on one Side or other of us as we went,
<PB N="80" REF="292"/>
and that sometimes, we should be obliged to
pass those middle Streams, as well as the
Rills and Brooks on the Sides, without a
Bridge, and at the Expence of pulling off our
Cloaths.</P>
<P>He told us, That we should meet, indeed,
with Provisions enough, and with an inno∣cent
harmless People, who, according to their
Ability, would entertain us very willingly;
but that I who was a Stranger, would be
sorely put to it for Lodging, especially for so
many of us.</P>
<P>However, he said, as he had, perhaps, at
first, raised this Curiosity in me, by giving
me a favourable Account of the Place, he
would be very far from discouraging me now;
and that if I resolved to go, he would not
only endeavour to make every thing as
pleasant to me as he could, but that he and
his <HI>Mayor Domo</HI> would go along with me,
and see us safe through, and safe home again▪
but desired me, not to be in too much haste,
for that he must make some little Preparation
for the Journey, which, as he told us, might,
perhaps, take us up Fourteen or Sixteen Days
forward, and as much backagain; Not, he said,
that it was necessary that we should be so
long going and coming, as that he supposed
I would take time to see every thing which
I might think worth seeing, and not be in so
much haste, as if I was sent Express. I told
him, He was very much in the right; That I
did not desire to make a thing, which I
expected so much Pleasure in, be a Toil to me
more than needs must; and above all, that, as
<PB N="81" REF="293"/>
I supposed, I should not return into these
Parts very soon, I would not take a cursory
View of a Place, which I expected would be
so well worth seeing, and let it be known to
all I should speak of it to, that I wanted to
see it again, before I could give a full Ac∣count
of it.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Seignior,</HI> says he, we will not be in
haste, or view it by halves; for if wild and
uncouth Places will be a Diversion to you, I
promise myself your Curiosity shall be fully
gratify'd; but as to extraordinary Things,
Rarities in Nature, and surprizing Incidents
which Foreigners expect, I cannot say much
to that. However, what think you, Seignior,
says he, if we should take a Tour a little
way into the Entrance of the Hills, which I
shewed you the other Day, and look upon
the Gate of this Gulph? Perhaps your Cu∣riosity
may be satisfy'd with the First Day's
Prospect, which, I assure you, will be none of
the most pleasant, and you may find yourself
sick of the Enterprize.</P>
<P>I told him, No; I was so resolved upon the
Attempt, since he, who, I was satisfy'd, would
not deceive me, had represented it as so
feazible, and especially since he had offered
to conduct me through it, that I would not,
for all the Gold that was in the Mountains,
lay it aside. He shook his Head at that Ex∣pression,
and smiling at the Doctor, says he,
This Gentleman little thinks that there is more
Gold in these Mountains, nay, even in this
Part where we are, than there is now above
Ground in the whole World: Partly un∣derstanding
<PB N="82" REF="294"/>
what he said, I answered, My
Meaning was, To let him see, that nothing
could divert me from the purpose of viewing
the Place, unless he himself forbid me, which,
I hoped he would not; and that as for looking
a little way into the Passage, to try if the
Horror of the Place would put a Check to
my Curiosity, I would not give him that Trou∣ble,
seeing the more terrible and frightful, the
more difficult and impracticable it was, pro∣vided
it could be master'd at last, the more
it would please me to attempt and over∣come
it.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, Seignior, <HI>said he pleasantly,</HI>
there's nothing difficult or impracticable in
it, nor is it any thing but what the Country-People,
and even some of our Nation, per∣form
every Day; and that, not only by
themselves, either for Sport in pursuit of Game,
but even with Droves of Cattle, which they
go with from Place to Place, as to a Market,
or a Fair; and, therefore, if the Horror of
the Clifts and Precipices, the Noises of the
<HI>Volcanos,</HI> the Fire, and such Things as you
may see and hear above you, will not put a
Stop to your Curiosity, I assure you, you
shall not meet with any thing unpassable or
impracticable below, nor any thing but what,
with the Assistance of God, and the Blessed
Virgin (<HI>and then he crossed himself, and so we
did all</HI>) we shall go chearfully over.</P>
<P>Finding, therefore, that I was thus reso∣lutely
bent upon the Enterprize, but not in
the least gues<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng at my Design, he gave
Order to have Servants and Mules provided,
<PB N="83" REF="295"/>
for Mules are much sitter to travel among
the Hills than Horses; and in Four Days he
promised to be ready for a March.</P>
<P>I had nothing to do in all these Four Days,
but to walk abroad, and, as we say, look
about me; but I took this Opportunity to
give Instructions to my Two Midship men,
who were called my Servants, in what they
were to do.</P>
<P>First, I charged them to make Land-marks,
Bearings, and Beacons, as we might call them,
upon the Points of the Rocks above them, and
at every Turning in the Way below them, al∣so
at the Reaches and Windings of the Rivers
or Brooks, Falls of Water, and every thing
remarkable; and to keep each of them sepa∣rate
and distinct Journals of those Things;
not only to find the Way back again by the
same Steps; but that they might be able to
find that Way afterwards by themselves, and
without Guides, which was the Bottom and
true Intent of all the rest of my Undertak∣ing;
and as I knew these were both capable
to do it, and had Courage and Fidelity to
undertake it, I had singled them out for the
Attempt, and had made them fully acquaint∣ed
with my whole Scheme, and, consequent∣ly,
they knew the Meaning and Reason of
my present Discourse with them: They
promised not to fail to shew me a Plan of
the Hills, with the Bearings of every Point,
one with another, where every Step was
to be taken, and every Turning to the Right
Hand, or to the Left, and such a Journal, I
believe, was never seen before, or since; but
<PB N="84" REF="296"/>
'tis too long for this Place. I shall, how∣ever,
take out the Heads of it as I go along,
which may serve as a general Description of
the Place.</P>
<P>The Evening of the Fourth Day, as he had
appointed, my Friend the <HI>Spaniard</HI> let me
know, That he was ready to set out, and
accordingly we began our Cavalcade: My
Retinue consisted of Six, as before, and
we had Mules provided for us; my Two
Midship-men, as Servants, had Two Mules
given them also for their Baggage: the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
had Six also, <HI>viz.</HI> His Gentleman, or, <HI>as</HI> I
<HI>called him before,</HI> his MAYOR DOMO, on
Horse-back, that is to say, On Mule-back,
with Mules for his Baggage, and Four Ser∣vants
on Foot. Just before we set out, his
Gentleman brought every one of us a Fuzee,
and our Two Servants, each a Harquebush,
or short Musket, with Cartouches, Powder
and Ball, and adjoyned a Pouch with small
Shot, such as we call Swan-Shot, for Fowls,
or Deer, as we saw Occasion.</P>
<P>I was as well pleased with this, as with
any thing, because I had not so intire a Con∣fidence
in the Native <HI>Chilians,</HI> as he had;
but I saw plainly, some Time after, that I
was wrong in that, for nothing could be more
honest, quiet, and free from Design, than
those People, except the poor honest People
where we dressed up the King and Queen, as
above.</P>
<P>We were late in the Morning before we
got out, having all this Equipage to furnish,
and travelling very gently, it was about Two
<PB N="85" REF="297"/>
Hours before Sun-set, when we came to the
Entrance of the Mountains, where, to my
Surprize, I found we were to go in upon a
Level, without any Ascent, at least, that
was considerable: We had, indeed, gone up
upon a pretty sharp Ascent, for near Two
Miles, before we came to the Place.</P>
<P>The Entrance was agreeable enough, the
Passage being near Half a Mile broad. On
the Left Hand, was a small River, whose
Channel was deep, but the Water shallow,
there having been but little Rain for some
Time; the Water ran very rapid, and, as
my <HI>Spaniard</HI> told me, was sometimes exceed∣ing
fierce; the Entrance lay inclining a
little <HI>South,</HI> and was so straight, that we
could see near a Mile before us; but the pro∣digious
Height of the Hills on both Sides, and
before us, appearing one over another, gave
such a Prospect of Horror, that, I confess, it
was frightful at first to look on the stupendous
Height of the Rocks: Every thing before us
looking one higher than another, was amazing;
and to see how, in some Places, they hungover
the River, and over the Passage, it threatned
a Man with being, some Time or other,
swallowed up.</P>
<P>The Rocks and Precipices on our Right
Hand, had, here and there vast Clefts
and Entrances, which looked as if they had
been different Thorough-fairs; but when we
came to look full into them, we could see
them close up at the farther End, and go off
in Slopes, and with Gullies made by the Water,
which, in has<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Rains, came pouring down
<PB N="86" REF="298"/>
from the Hills, and which, at a Distance,
made such Noises, as 'tis impossible to con∣ceive,
unless by having seen and heard the
like; for the Water failing sometimes from
a Height Twenty Times as high as the Mo∣nument,
and, perhaps, much more, and meet∣ing
in the Passage with many Dashes and
Interruptions, 'tis impossible to describe how,
the Sound crossing, and interfering, mingled
itself, and the several Noises sunk one into
another, increasing the Whole, as the many
Waters joining, increased the main Stream.</P>
<P>We entred this Passage about Two Miles
the first Night: After the first Length, which,
as I said, held about Three Quarters of a
Mile, we turned away to the <HI>South,</HI> short
on the Right Hand; the River leaving us,
seemed to come through a very narrow, but
deep, Hollow of the Mountains, where there
was little more Breadth at the Bottom, than
the Channel took up, though the Rocks gave
back as they ascended, as placed in several
Stages, though all horrid and irregular, and
we could see nothing but Blackness and Ter∣ror
all the Way. I was glad our Way did
not turn on that Side, but wondred, that we
should leave the River, and the more, when
I found, that in the Way we went, having
first mounted gently a green pleasant Slope,
when it declined again, we found, as it were,
a New Rivulet began in the Middle, and
the Water ran <HI>S. E</HI> or thereabouts: This made
me begin to ask, If the Water went away in∣to
the New World beyond the Hills? My
Patron smiled, and said, No, Seignior, not
<PB N="87" REF="299"/>
yet; we shall meet with the other River
again very quickly; and so we found it the
next Morning.</P>
<P>When we came a little farther, we found
the Passage open, and we came to a very
pleasant Plain, which declined a little gra∣dually,
widening to the Left, or <HI>East</HI> Side; On
the Right Side of this, we saw another vast
Opening like the first, which went in about
Half a Mile, and then clos'd up as the first
had done, sloping up to the Top of the Hills
a most monstrous, inconceivable Height.</P>
<P>My Patron stopping here, and getting
down, or alighting from his Mule, gave him
to his Man, and asking me to alight, told
me, This was the first Night's Entertainment
I was to meet with in the <HI>Andes,</HI> and hoped
I was prepared for it. I told him, That I
might very well consent to accept of such
Entertainment, in a Journey of my own con∣triving,
as he was content to take up with
in Compliment to me.</P>
<P>I looked round me, to see if there were any
Huts or Cots of the Mountaniers thereabouts,
but I perceived none; only I observed some∣thing
like a House, and it was really a
House of some of the said Mountaniers
upon the Top of a Precipice as high from
where we stood, as the Top of the Cupulo of
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, and I saw some living Creatures,
whether Men or Women, I could not tell,
looking from thence down upon us: How∣ever,
I understood afterwards, That they had
Ways to come at their Dwelling, which were
very easy and agreeable, and had Lanes and
<PB N="88" REF="300"/>
Plains where they sed their Cattle, and had
every thing growing that they desired.</P>
<P>My Patron making a kind of an Invita∣tion
to me to walk, took me up that dark
Chasm, or Opening on the Right Hand,
which I have just mentioned; Here, Sir,
said he, if you will venture to walk a few
Steps, 'tis likely we may shew you some of
the Product of this Country; but as it grew
towards Night, he added, But I see if is too
dark; perhaps we may do it in the Morning:
And with this, we walked back towards the
Place where we left our Mules and Servants,
and when we came thither, there was a
complete Camp fixed, Three very hand∣some
Tents raised, and a Bar set up at a
Distance, where the Mules were tyed one to
another to graze, and the Servants, and the
Baggage, lay together with an open Tent
over them.</P>
<P>My Patron led me into the First Tent,
and told me, He was obliged to let me know,
That I must make shift with that Lodging,
the Place not affording any better.</P>
<P>Here we had Quilts laid very artificially
and clever, for me and my Three Comerades,
and we lodged very comfortably; but be∣fore
we came to that, we had the Third
Tent to go to, in which there was a very
handsome Table, covered with all Conveni∣encies,
and, in a Word, with a cold Treat.
that is to say, Cold roasted Mutton and Beef,
very well dress'd; and after that, some
Potred or Baked Venison, with Pickles, Con∣serves,
and very fine Sweetmeats.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="301"/>
Here we eat very freely, but he bid us
depend upon it, That we should not fare so
well the next Night; and so it would be worse
every Night, 'till we came to lie intirely
at a <HI>Mountanier</HI>'s; but he was better to us
than he pretended.</P>
<P>In the Morning, we had our Chocolate as
regularly as we used to have it in his own
House, and we were up, and ready to tra∣vel,
in a Moment. We went winding now
from the <HI>S. E.</HI> to the Left, 'till our Course
looked <HI>E.</HI> by <HI>N.</HI> when we came again to have
the River in View. But I should have ob∣served
here, That my Two Midship men,
and Two of my Patron's Servants, had, by
his Direction, been, very early in the Morn∣ing,
clambering up the Rocks in the Open∣ing
on the Right Hand, and had come back
again about a Quarter of an Hour after we
set out; when, missing my Two Men, I en∣quired
for them, and my Patron said, They
were coming; for, it seems, he saw them
at a Distance, and so we halted for
them.</P>
<P>When they were come almost up to us, he
call'd to his Men in <HI>Spanish</HI> to ask, If they
had had <HI>Una bon Vejo?</HI> They answer'd, <HI>Poco,
Poco:</HI> And when they came quite up, one of
my Midship-Men shew'd me Three or Four
small Bits of clean perfect Gold, which they
had pick'd up in the Hill or Gullet where the
Water trickled down from the Rocks; and
the <HI>Spaniard</HI> told them, That had they had
Time, they should have found much more, the
Water being quite down, and no Body having
<PB N="90" REF="302"/>
been there since the last hard Rain. One of
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had Three small Bits in his
Hand also; I said nothing for the present,
but charg'd my Midship Men to mark the
Place, and so we went on.</P>
<P>We follow'd up the Stream of this Water
for Three Days more, encamping every Night
as before; in which Time we pass'd by seve∣ral
such Openings into the Rocks, on either
Side. On the Fourth Day we had the Pro∣spect
of a very pleasant Valley and River be∣low
us on the <HI>North</HI> Side; keeping its Course
almost in the Middle; the Valley reaching
near Four Miles in Length, and in some Places
near Two Miles broad.</P>
<P>This Sight was perfectly surprizing, because
here we found the Vale fruitful, level, and in∣habited,
there being several small Villages or
Clusters of Houses, such as the <HI>Chilians</HI> live in,
which are low Houses, cover'd with a Kind of
Sedge, and shelter'd with little Rows of thick
grown Trees, of what Kind we knew not.</P>
<P>We saw no Way thro', nor which Way we
were to go out; but saw it every where
bounded with prodigious Mountains, look to
which Side of the Valley we would: We kept
still on the Right, which was now the <HI>South-East
Side</HI> of the River, and, as we followed it
up the Stream, it was still less than at first, and
lessened every Step we went, because of the
Number of Rills we left behind us: And
here we encamped the Fifth Time, and
all this while the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentleman victu∣aelled
us: 'Then we turned again to the
Right, where we had a new and beau∣tiful
<PB N="91" REF="303"/>
Prospect of another Valley, as broad as
the other, but not above a Mile in length.</P>
<P>After we were thro' this Valley, my Pa∣tron
rides up to a poor little Cottage of a
<HI>Chilian Indian,</HI> without any Ceremony, and
calling us all about him, told us, That there
we would go to Dinner: We saw a Smoke in∣deed
<HI>in</HI> the House, rather than come <HI>out</HI> of
it; and it smother'd thro' a Hole in the
Roof instead of a Chimney: However to this
House, as to an Inn, my Patron had sent a∣way
his <HI>Mayor Domo</HI> and another Servant,
and there, they were as busy as Two Cooks,
boiling and stewing Goats Flesh, and Fowls,
making us Soup, Broth, and such Hodge-Podge,
as it seems they were us'd to provide, and
which, however homely the Cottage was, we
found very favoury and good.</P>
<P>Immediately a loose Tent was pitch'd, and
we had our Table set up, and Dinner serv'd in,
and within about Two Hours, we had eaten it,
repos'd ourselves after it (as the Custom there
is) and were ready to travel again.</P>
<P>I had Room all this while to observe, and
wonder at the admirable Structure of this Place,
which may serve, in my Opinion, for the
Eighth Wonder of the World; that is to say,
supposing there were but Seven before. We
had in the Middle of the Day, indeed, a very
hot Sun, and the Reflection from the Moun∣tains
made it still hotter; but the Heighth of
the Rocks on every Side began to cast long
Shadows before Three a Clock, except
where the Openings look'd toward the West,
and as soon as those Shadows reach'd us,
<PB N="92" REF="304"/>
the cool Breezes of the Air came naturally on
drawing every Way exceeding pleasant and
refreshing.</P>
<P>The Place we were in, was green and flou∣rishing,
and the Soil well cultivated by the
poor industrious <HI>Chilians,</HI> who liv'd here in
perfect Solitude, and pleas'd with their Liberty
from the Tyranny of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who very
seldom visited them, and never molested them,
being pretty much out of their Way, except
when they came for Hunting and Diversion;
and then they used the <HI>Chilians</HI> always civilly,
because they were oblig'd to them for their
Assistance in their Diversions; the <HI>Chilians</HI> of
those Valleys being very active, strong, and
nimble Fellows.</P>
<P>By this Means, most of them were furnish'd
with Fire-Arms, Powder, and Shot, and were
very good Marks-Men; but as to Violence a∣gainst
any Body, they entertained no Thought
of that Kind, as I could perceive, but were
content with their Way of Living, which
was easy and free.</P>
<P>The Tops of the Mountains here, the Valleys
being so large, were much plainer to be seen,
than where the Passages were narrow; for
there the Heighth was so great, that we could
see nothing. Here, at several Distances (the
Rocks towring one over another) we might see
Smoak come out of some, <HI>Snow</HI> lying upon
others, Trees and Bushes growing upon
others; and Goats, wild Asses, and other
Creatures, which we could hardly distinguish,
running about on others.</P>

<P><PB N="93" REF="306"/>
When we had pass'd thro' this second Valley,
I perceiv'd we came to a narrower Passage,
and something like the first; the Entrance into
it indeed was smooth, and above a Quarter of
a Mile broad, and it went winding away to
the <HI>North,</HI> and then again turn'd round to the
<HI>N. E.</HI> afterwards almost due <HI>East,</HI> and then to
the <HI>S. E.</HI> and so to <HI>S. S. E.</HI> and this frightful
narrow Straight, with the hanging Rocks almost
closing together on the Top, whose Heighth
we could neither see or guess at, continued about
Three Days Journey more, most of the Way as∣cending
gently upwards: And as to the River,
it was by this Time quite lost; but we might
see, that on any Occasion of Rain, or of the
melting of the Snow on the Mountains, there
was a Hollow in the Middle of the Valley,
thro' which the Water made its Way, and on
either hand the Sides of the Hills were full of
the like Gullies, made by the Violence of the
Rain, where, not the Earth only, but the
Rocks themselves, even the very Stone, seem'd
to be worn and penetrated by the continual
Fall of the Water.</P>
<P>Here my Patron shew'd me, that in the
Hollow, which I mention'd, in the Middle of
this Way, and at the Bottom of those Gullies,
or Places worn, as above, in the Rocks, there
were often found Pieces of Gold, and some∣times,
after a Rain, very great Quantities;
and that there were few of the little <HI>Chilian</HI>
Cottages, which I had seen, where they had
not sometimes a Pound or Two of Gold Dust,
and Lumps of Gold by them; and he was
mistaken, if I was willing to tarry, and make
<PB N="94" REF="307"/>
the Experiment, if we did not find some
even then, in a very little Search.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chilian</HI> Mountainier, at whose House
we had stopp'd, to dine, had gone with us, and he
hearing my Patron say thus, runs presently to
the hollow Channel in the Middle; there was
a Kind of a Fall, or Break in it, where the
Water by falling, perhaps, Two or Three
Foot, had made a little Place deeper than the
rest; and which, tho' there was no Water
then running, yet had Water in it, perhaps
the Quantity of a Barrel or Two: Here, with
the Help of Two of the Servants, and a Kind
of Scoop, he presently threw out the Water,
with the Sand, and whatever was at Bottom
among it, into the ordinary Water-Course; the
Water salling thus hard, every Scoop-full
upon the Sand or Earth that came out of the
Scoop before it, wash'd a great deal of it
away; and among that which remain'd, we
might plainly see little Lumps of Gold
shining as big as Grains of Sand, and some∣times
One or Two a little bigger.</P>
<P>This was Demonstration enough to us; I
took up some small Grains of it, about the
Quantity of Half a Quarter of an Ounce, and
left my Midship-Men to take up more, and
they staid indeed so long, that they could
scarce see their Way to overtake us, and brought
away about Two Ounces in all, the <HI>Chilian</HI>
and the Servants very freely giving them all
they found.</P>
<P>When we had travell'd about Nine Miles
more in this winding frightful narrow
Way, it began to grow towards Night, and
<PB N="95" REF="308"/>
my Patron talk'd of taking up our Quarters
as we had before; but his Gentleman put him
in Mind of a <HI>Chilian,</HI> one of their Old Ser∣vants,
who lived in a Turning among the
Mountains, about Half a Mile out of our
Way, and where we might be accommodated
again with the Helps of a House, and Place,
at least, for our Cookery: Very true, says
our Patron, We will go thither, and there,
Seignior, says he, turning to me, You shall
see an Emblem of complete Felicity, even in
the Middle of this Place of Horror; and you
shall see a Prince greater, and more truly so,
than King <HI>Philip,</HI> who is the greatest Man in
the World.</P>
<P>Accordingly we went softly on, his Gen∣tleman
having advanced before, and, in about
Half a Mile, we found a Turning or Open∣ing
on our Left, where we beheld a deep,
large Valley, almost Circular, and of about
a Mile Diameter, and abundance of Houses,
or Cottages, interspers'd all over it, so that
the whole Valley looked like an inhabited
Village, and the Ground, like a planted
Garden.</P>
<P>We, who, as I said, had been for some
Miles ascending upwards, were so high above
them, that the low Valley looked, as the
Low Lands in <HI>England</HI> look below <HI>Box-Hill,</HI>
in <HI>Surrey;</HI> and I began to ask, How we should
get down? But as we were come into a
wider Space than before, so we had more
Day-light; for though the Hollow Way had
rendred it near dusk before, now it was almost
clear Day again.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="309"/>
Here we parted with the First <HI>Chilian</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
mentioned, and I ordered one of my Midship∣men
to give him a Hat, and a Piece of Black
Bays, enough to make him a Cloak, which
so obliged the Man, that he knew not what
way to testify his Joy: But I knew what I
was doing in this; and I ordered my Mid∣ship-man
to do it, that he might make his
Acquaintance with him against another Time,
and it was not a Gift ill-bestowed, as will
appear in its Place.</P>
<P>We were now obliged to quit our Mules,
who all took up their Quarters at the Top of
the Hill, while we, by Footings made in the
Rocks, descended, as we might say, down a
Pair of Stairs of Half a Mile long, but with
many plain Places between, like Foot-paces,
for the Ease of going and coming.</P>
<P>Thus winding and turning, to avoid the
Declivity of the Hill, we came very safe
to the Bottom, where my Patron's Gentle∣man,
and our New Landlord, <HI>that was to
be,</HI> came to pay his Compliment to us.</P>
<P>He was dressed in a Jerkin made of an Ot∣ter
Skin, like a Doublet, a Pair of long <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Breeches of Leather, dress'd after the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Fashion, Green, and very soft, and
which looked very well, but what the Skin
was, I could not guess; he had over it a
Mantle, of a kind of Cotton, dyed in Two
or Three grave Brown Colours, and thrown
about him like a <HI>Scotsman</HI>'s Plaid; he
had Shoes of a particular Make, tied on
like Sandals, flat-heeled, no Stockings, his
Breeches hanging down below the Calf of his
<PB N="97" REF="310"/>
Leg, and his Shoes lacing up above his
Ancles; he had on a Cap of the Skin of some
small Beast like a <HI>Racoon,</HI> with a bit of the
Tail hanging out from the Crown of his
Head backward, a long Pole in his Hand;
and a Servant, as oddly dress'd as himself,
carried his Gun; he had neither Spado nor
Dagger.</P>
<P>When our Patron came up, the <HI>Chilian</HI>
stepped forward, and made him Three very
low Bows, and then they talked together,
not in <HI>Spanish,</HI> but in a kind of <HI>Mountain
Jargon,</HI> some <HI>Spanis,</HI> and some <HI>Chilian,</HI> of
which I scarce understood one Word: After
a few Words, I understood he said something
of a Stranger come to see, <HI>and then, I suppose,
added,</HI> the Passages of the Mountains; then
the <HI>Chilian</HI> came towards me, made me
Three Bows, and bad me welcome in <HI>Spanish:</HI>
As soon as he had said that, he turns to his
<HI>Barbarian, I mean, His Servant, for he was
as ugly a look'd Fellow as ever I saw,</HI> and tak∣ing
his Gun from him, presented it to me,
my Patron bad me take it, <HI>for he saw me a
little at a Loss what to do,</HI> telling me, That
as it was the greatest Compliment that a
<HI>Chilian</HI> could pay to me, he would be ve∣ry
ill pleased, and out of Humour, if it was
not accepted, and would think we did not
care to be friendly with him.</P>
<P>As we had given this <HI>Chilian</HI> no Notice of
our coming, no, not a Quarter of an Hour,
we could not expect great Matters of Entertain∣ment,
and, as we carried our Provision with
<PB N="98" REF="311"/>
us, we did not stand in much need of it; but
we had no Reason to complain.</P>
<P>This Man's Habitation was all the same
as the rest; low, and covered with a Sedge,
or a kind of Reed, which we found grew
very plentifully in the Valley where he liv'd;
he had several Pieces of Ground round his
Dwelling, inclosed with Stone Walls, made
very artificially with small Stones, and no
Mortar; these inclosed Grounds were planted
with several kinds of Garden-stuff for his
Household, such as Plantains, <HI>Spanish</HI> Ca∣bages,
Green Cocoa, and other Things of the
Growth of their own Country, and Two of
them with <HI>European</HI> Wheat.</P>
<P>He had Five or Six Apartments in his House,
every one of them had a Door into the Air,
and into one another, and Two of them were
very large and decent, had long Tables on
one Side made after their own Way, and
Benches to fit to them like our Country Peo∣ples
long Tables in <HI>England,</HI> and Mattresses
like Couches all along the other Side, with
Skins of several Sorts of wild Creatures laid
on them to repose on in the Heat of the Day,
as is the Usage among the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Our People set up their Tents and Beds abroad
as before; but my Patron told me, The <HI>Chi∣lian</HI>
would take it very ill, if he and I did not
take up our Lodging in his House, and we
had Two Rooms provided, very magnificent
in their Way. The Mattress we lay on,
had a large Canopy over if, spread like the
Crown of a Tent, and covered with a large
Piece of Cotton, white as Milk, and which
<PB N="99" REF="312"/>
came round every way like a Curtain; so
that, if it had been in the Open Field, it
would have been a complete Covering; the
Bed, such as it was, might be as hard as a
Quilt, and not more, and the Covering was
of the same Cotton as the Curtain-work,
which, it seems, is the Manufacture of the
<HI>Chilian</HI> Women, and is made very dextrously;
it looked wild, but was pleasant enough, and
proper to the Place; so I slept very com∣fortably
in it.</P>
<P>But, I must confess, I was surprized at
the Aspect of Things in the Night here.
It was, as I told you above, near Night
when we came to this Man's Cottage (Palace
I should have called it) and while we were
taking our Repast, which was very pretty,
it grew quite Night; we had Wax Can∣dles
brought in for Light, which, it seems,
my Patron's Man had provided; and the
Place had so little Communication with the
Air by Windows, that we saw nothing of
what was without Doors.</P>
<P>After Supper, my Patron turns to me,
Come, Seignior, said he, pray prepare your∣self
to take a Walk: What, in the Dark, said
I, in such a Country as this? No, no, says
he, It is never dark here, you are now come
to the Country of Everlasting Day; What
think you? Is not this <HI>Elisium?</HI> I do not
understand you, says I; But you will pre∣sently,
says he, when I shall shew you, that
'tis now lighter Abroad, than when we came
in. Soon after this, some of the Servants
opened the Door that went into the next
<PB N="100" REF="313"/>
Room, and the Door of that Room, which
opened into the Air, stood open, from whence
a Light of Fire shone into the outer Room,
and so farther into ours: What are they
burning there, says I to my Patron? You
will see presently, says he; adding, I hope
you will not be surprized; so he led me out
to that Door.</P>
<P>But who can express the Thoughts of a
Man's Heart, coming on a sudden into a Place
where the whole World seemed to be of a
light Fire, the Valley was on one Side so ex∣ceeding
bright, the Eye could scarce bear to
look at it; the Sides of the Mountains were
shining like the Fire itself; the Flame from
the Top of the Mountain on the other Side,
casting its Light directly upon them, from
thence the Reflection into other Parts look'd
Red, and more terrible; for the first was
white and clear, like the Light of the Sun; but
the other being, as it were, a Reflection of Light
mix'd with some darker Cavities, represented
the Fire of a Furnace; and, in short, it
might well be said, here was no Darkness;
But, certainly, at the first View it gives no
Traveller any other Idea than that of being
at the very Entrance into Eternal Horror.</P>
<P>All this while there was no Fire, that is
to say, No real Flame to be seen, only, that
where the Flame was, it shone clearly into
the Valley; but the <HI>Volcano,</HI> or <HI>Volcanos,</HI>
from whence the Fire issued out (for it seems
there were no less than Three of them, tho'
at the Distance of some Miles from one ano∣ther)
were on the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>East</HI> Sides of the
<PB N="101" REF="314"/>
Valley, which was so much on that Side
where we were, that we could see nothing but
the Light, neither on the other Side, could
they see any more, it seems, than just the
Top of the Flame; nor knowing any thing of
the Places from whence it issued out, which
no mortal Creature, no, not of the <HI>Chilians</HI>
themselves, were ever hardy enough to go
near; nor would it be possible if any should
attempt it, the Tops of the Hills, for many
Leagues about them, being covered with new
Mountains of Ashes and Stones, which are
daily cast out of the Mouths of those <HI>Volca∣nos,</HI>
by which, they grew every Day higher
than they were before, and which would
overwhelm not only Men, but whole Armies
of Men, if they should venture to come near
them.</P>
<P>When first we came into the long narrow
Way I mentioned last, I observed, That, as
I thought, the Wind blew very hard aloft
among the Hills, and that it made a Noise
like Thunder, which I thought nothing of,
but as a Thing usual; But now, when I came
to this terrible Sight, and that I heard the
same Thunder, and yet found the Air calm
and quiet, I soon understood, that it was a
continued Thunder, occasioned by the Roar∣ing
of the Fire in the Bowels of the Moun∣tains.</P>
<P>It was some Time, you may suppose, be∣fore
a Traveller, unacquainted with such
Things, could make them familiar to him;
and though the Horror and Surprize might
abate, after proper Reflections on the Nature
<PB N="102" REF="315"/>
and Reason of the Thing, yet I had a kind
of Astonishment upon me for a great while;
every different Place to which I turned
my Eye, presented me with a new Scene of
Horror; I was, for a while, frighted at the
Fire being, as it were, over my Head, for I
could see nothing of it; but that the Air
looked as if it were all on Fire, and I could
not persuade myself but it would cast down
the Rocks and Mountains on my Head; But
they laugh'd me out of that Part.</P>
<P>After a while, I asked them, If these <HI>Vol∣canos</HI>
did not cast out a kind of Liquid Fire,
as I had seen an Account of on the monstrous
Eruptions at Mount <HI>Aetna,</HI> which cast out
a prodigious Stream of Fire, and ran Eight
Leagues into the Sea? Upon my putting this
Question to my Patron, he asked the <HI>Chilian,</HI>
How long ago it was since <HI>such a Stream,</HI>
calling it by a Name of their own, ran Fire?
He answered, It ran now, and if we were
disposed to walk but Three Furlongs, we
should see it.</P>
<P>He said little to me, but asked me, If I
car'd to walk a little way by this kind of
Light? I told him, It was a surprizing Place
we were in, but I supposed he would lead me
into no Danger; he said, He would assure me
he would lead me into no Danger; That these
Things were very familiar to them; but that
I might depend there was no Hazard, and
that the Flames which gave all this Light,
were Six or Seven Miles off, and some of
them more; We walked along the Plain of
(the Valley about Half a Mile, when another
<PB N="103" REF="316"/>
great Valley opened to the Right, and gave
us a more dreadful Prospect than any we had
seen before; For at the farther End of this
Second Valley, but at the Distance of about
Three Miles from where we stood, we saw
a livid Stream of Fire come running down
the Sides of the Mountain for near Three
Quarters of a Mile in Length, running like
melted Metal into a Mould, or out of a Fur∣nace,
'till, I supposed, as it came nearer the
Bottom, it cooled and separated, and so went
out of itself.</P>
<P>Beyond this, over the Summit of a pro∣digious
Mountain, we could see the Tops of
the clear Flame of a <HI>Volcano,</HI> a dreadful one
no doubt, could we have seen it all; and from
the Mouth of which, it was supposed this
Stream of Fire came, though the <HI>Chilian</HI> as∣sured
us, that the Fire itself was Eight
Leagues off, and that the Liquid Fire which
we saw, came out of the Side of the Moun∣tain,
and was Two Leagues off of the great
<HI>Volcano</HI> itself, running like Metal out of a
Furnace.</P>
<P>They told me, There was a great deal of
melted Gold ran down with the other in∣flamed
Earth in that Stream, and that much
Gold was afterwards found there; but this I
was to take upon Trust.</P>
<P>This Sight was, as you will easily sup∣pose,
best at a Distance, and, indeed, I had
enough of it; as for my Two Midship-men,
they were almost frighted out of all their Re∣solutions
of going any farther in this horrible
Place, and when we came back, they came
<PB N="104" REF="317"/>
mighty seriously to me, and begg'd of me
for God's sake, not to venture any farther up∣on
the Faith of these <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for that they
would certainly carry us all into some Mis∣chief
or other, and betray us.</P>
<P>I bid them be easy, for I saw nothing in it
all, that look'd like Treachery; That it was
true, indeed, it was a terrible Place to look
on, but it seemed to be nothing but what
was natural and familiar there, and we should
be soon out of it. They told me very seri∣ously,
That they believed it was the very
Mouth of Hell, and that, in short, they were
not able to bear it, and begged of me to go
back: I told them No, I could not think of
going back; but if they could not endure it,
I would give Consent that they should go
back in the Morning: However, we went, for
the present, to the <HI>Chilian</HI>'s House again, where
we got a plentiful Draught of <HI>Chilian</HI> Wine,
for my Patron had taken care to have a good
Quantity of it with us, and in the Morning
my Two Midship-men, who got very drunk
over Night, had Courage enough to venture
forward again; for the Light of the Sun put
quite another Face upon Things, and nothing
of the Fire was then to be seen, only the
Smoke.</P>
<P>All our Company lodged in the Tents here,
but I and any Patron the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who lodged
within the <HI>Chilian</HI>'s House, as I told you.
This <HI>Chilian</HI> was a great Man among the Na∣tives,
and all the Valley I spoke of, which
lay round his Dwelling, was called his own;
he lived in a State of perfect Tranquility,
<PB N="105" REF="318"/>
neither enjoying nor coveting any thing but
what was necessary, and wanting nothing
that was so; he had Gold, as it might be
said, for picking it up off of the Dunghil,
for it was found in all the little Gullies and
Rills of Water, which, as I have said, come
down from the Mountains on every Side; yet
I did not find, that he troubled himself to
lay up any great Quantity more than serv'd
to go to <HI>Villa Rica,</HI> and buy what he wanted
for himself and Family; he had, it seems, a
Wife, and some Daughters, but no Sons;
these lived in a separate House, about a Fur∣long
from this where he lived, and were
kept there as a Family by themselves, and
if he had had any Sons, they would have
lived with him.</P>
<P>He did not offer to go with us any part of
our Way, as the other had done; but, having
entertained us with great Civility, took his
Leave. I caused one of my Midship-men
to make him a Present, when we came away,
of a Piece of Black Bays, enough to make
him a Cloak, as I did the other, and a Piece
of Blue <HI>English</HI> Serge, enough to make him
a Jerkin and Breeches, which he accepted as
a great Bounty.</P>
<P>We set out again, though not very early
in the Morning, having, as I said, sat up
late, and drank freely, over Night, and we
found, that after we had been gone to sleep,
it had rained very hard, and though the Rain
was over before we went out, yet the falling
of the Water from the Hills, made such a
confused Noise, and was eccho'd so backward
<PB N="106" REF="319"/>
and forward from all Sides, that it was like
a strange Mixture of distant Thunder, and
though we knew the Causes, yet it could not
but be surprizing to us for a while.</P>
<P>However, we set forward, the Way under
Foot being pretty good; and first we went up
the Steps again, by which we had come down
(our last Host waiting on us thither) and
there I gave him back his Gun, for he would
not take it before.</P>
<P>In this Valley, which was the pleasantest
by Day, and the most dismal by Night, that
ever I saw, I observed abundance of Goats,
as well tame in the Inclosures, as wild upon
the Rocks; and we found afterwards, that
the last were perfectly wild, and to be had,
like those at <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> by any body
that could catch them; my Patron sent
off Two of his Men, just as a Huntsman casts
off This Hounds, to go and catch Goats, and
they brought us in Three, which they shot
in less than Half an Hour, and these we car∣ried
with us for our Evening Supply, for we
made no Dinner this Day, having fed hear∣tily
in the Morning about Nine, and had
Chocolate Two Hours before that.</P>
<P>We travelled now along the narrow, wind∣ing
Passage, which I mentioned before, for
about Four Hours, 'till I found, that though
we had ascended but gently, yet, that, as we
had done so for almost Twenty Miles toge∣ther,
we were got up to a frightful Height, and
I began to expect some very difficult Descent
on the other Side; But we were made easy
about Two a Clock, when the Way not only
<PB N="107" REF="320"/>
declined again to the <HI>East,</HI> but grew wider,
though with frequent Turnings and Winding
about, so that we could seldom see above
Half a Mile before us: We went on thus pret∣ty
much upon a Level, now rising, now fall∣ing;
but still I found that we were a very
great Height from our first Entrance, and as
to the running of the Water, I found that it
flow'd neither <HI>East</HI> nor <HI>West,</HI> but run all down
the little Turnings that we frequently met
with on the <HI>North</HI> Side of our Way, which,
my Patron told me, went all into the great
Valley where we saw the Fire, and so went
away by a general Channel <HI>North West</HI> 'till
it found its Way out into the open Country
of <HI>Chili,</HI> and so to the <HI>South-Seas.</HI></P>
<P>We were now come to another Night's
Lodging, which we were obliged to take up
with on the green Grass, as we did the First
Night; but by the Help of our Proveditor-General,
my Patron, we fared very well, our
Goats-Flesh being reduced into so many
Sorts of Venison, that none of us could di∣stinguish
it from the best Venison we ever
tasted.</P>
<P>Here we slept without any of the frightful
Things we saw the Night before, except, that
we might see the Light of the Fire in the Air,
at a great Distance, like a great City on Fire,
but that gave us no Disturbance at all.</P>
<P>In the Morning our Two Hunters shot a
Deer, or rather a young Fawn, before we
were awake, and this was the first we met
with in this Part of our Travel, and thus
we were provided for Dinner even before
<PB N="108" REF="321"/>
Breakfast-time; as for our Breakfast, it was
always a <HI>Spanish</HI> Breakfast, that is to say,
About a Pint of Chocolate.</P>
<P>We set out very merrily in the Morning,
and we that were <HI>Englishmen,</HI> could not refrain
smiling at one another, to think how we
pass'd through a Country where the Gold lay
in every Ditch, as we might call it, and ne∣ver
troubled ourselves so much as to stoop to
take it up; so certain is it, that 'tis easy to
be placed in a Station of Life, where that
very Gold (the heaping up of which, is here
made the main Business of Man's living in the
World) would be of no Value, and not worth
taking off from the Ground; nay, not of Sig∣nification
enough to make a Present of, for
that was the Case here. Two or Three Yards
of <HI>Colchester</HI> Bays, a coarse Rug-like Manu∣facture,
worth in <HI>London,</HI> about Fifteen-Pence
Half-penny <HI>per</HI> Yard, was here a Pre∣sent
for a Man of Quality, when for a Hand∣ful
of Gold-Dust, the same Person would
scarce say, Thank-you; or, perhaps, would
think himself not kindly treated to have it
offered him.</P>
<P>We travelled this Day pretty smartly,
having rested at Noon about Two Hours, as
before, and, by my Calculation, went about
Twenty-two <HI>English</HI> Miles in all; about
Five a Clock in the Afternoon, we came in∣to
a broad, plain, open Place, where, though
it was not properly a Valley, yet we found
it lay very level for a good way together.
Our Way lying almost E. S. E. after we had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arched so about Two Miles, I found the Way
<PB N="109" REF="322"/>
go evidently down Hill, and in Half a Mile
more, to our singular Satisfaction, we found,
the Water from the Mountains ran plainly
<HI>Eastward,</HI> and, consequently, to the <HI>North
Sea.</HI></P>
<P>We saw, at a Distance, several Huts, or
Houses of the <HI>Mountanier</HI> Inhabitants, but
we came near none of them, but kept on our
Way, going down Two or Three pretty steep
Places, not at all dangerous, though some∣thing
difficult.</P>
<P>We encamped again the next Night, as
before, and still our good Caterer had Plenty
of Food for us; But I observed, That the
next Morning, when we set forward, our
Tents were left standing, the Baggage-Mules
tied together to graze, and our Company
lessned by all my Patrons Servants, which,
when I enquired about, he told me, He hoped
we should have good Quarters quickly
without them. I did not understand him for
the present, but it unriddled itself soon after;
for though we travelled Four Days more in
that Narrow Way, yet he always found us
Lodging at the Cottages of the Mountaniers.
The Sixth Day we went all Day up Hill; at
last, on a sudden, the Way turn'd short <HI>East,</HI>
and opened into a vast wide Country, bound∣less
to the Eye every way, and delivered
us intirely from the Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI>
in which we had wandred so long.</P>
<P>Any one may guess what an agreeable Sur∣prize
this was to us, to whom it was the main
End of our Travels. We made no Question
that this was the open Country extended to
<PB N="110" REF="323"/>
the <HI>North,</HI> or <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, but how far
it was thither, or what Inhabitants it was
possessed by, what Travelling, what Provi∣sions
to be found by the Way, what Rivers
to pass, and whether any navigable or not;
this our Patron himself could not tell us one
Word of; owning frankly to us, That he had
never been one Step farther than the Place
where we then stood; and that he had been
there only once to satisfy his Curiosity, as I
did now.</P>
<P>I told him, That if I had lived where he did,
and had had Servants and Provisions at Com∣mand,
as he had, at would have been Impossi∣ble
for me to have restrained my Curiosity
so far, as not to have search'd through that
whole Country to the Sea-Side long ago: I told
him, it seemed to be a pleasant and
fruitful Soil, and, no doubt, was capable of
Cultivations and Improvements; and if it
had been only to have possessed such a Coun∣try
in his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty's Name, it must
nave heen worth while to undertake the Dis∣covery
for the Honour of <HI>Spain;</HI> and that
there could be no Room to question, but his
<HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty would have honoured him
that should have undertaken such a Thing,
with some particular Mark of his Favour,
which might be of Consequence to him and
his Family.</P>
<P>He told me, That as to that, the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
seemed already to have more Dominions in
<HI>America,</HI> than they could keep, and much
more than they were able to reap the Benefit
of, and still more infinitely than they could
<PB N="111" REF="324"/>
improve, and especially in those Parts called
<HI>South America.</HI></P>
<P>That it was next to miraculous, that they
could keep the Possession where they were,
and were not the <HI>Natives</HI> so utterly destitute
of Support from any other Part of the World,
as not to be able to have either Arms or
Ammunition put into their Hands, it would
be impossible, since, I might easily see, they
were Men that wanted not Strength of Body,
or Courage; and it was evident, they did
not want Numbers, seeing they were already
Ten thousand <HI>Natives</HI> to one <HI>Spaniard,</HI> taking
the whole Country from one End to the other.</P>
<P>He went on, Then you see, Seignior, says
he, how far we are from Improvement in
that Part of the Country which we possess,
and many more which, you may be sure, are
among these vast Mountains, and which we ne∣ver
discovered, seeing all these Valleys and
Passages among the Mountains, where Gold
is to be had in such Quantities, and with so
much Ease, that every poor <HI>Chilian</HI> gathers
it up with his Hands, and may have as much
as he pleases, are all left open, naked, and
unregarded, in the Possession of the wild
Mountaniers, who are Heathens and Savages;
and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> you see, says he, are so
few, and these few so indolent, so slothful,
and so satisfied with the Gold they get of
the <HI>Chilians</HI> for Things of small Value in
Trade, that all this vast Treasure lies unre∣garded
by them. Nay, adds he, Is it not
very odd to observe, That when for our
Diversion we come out into the Hills,
<PB N="112" REF="325"/>
and among these Places where you see the
Gold is so easily found, we come, as we call
it, a Hunting, and divert ourselves more
with shooting wild Parrots, or a Fawn or
two, for which also, we ride, and
run, and make our Servants weary themselves more
than they would in fishing up the Gold among
the Gullies and Holes that the Water makes
in the Rocks, and more than would suffice to
find Fifty, nay, One hundred times the Va∣lue
in Gold?</P>
<P>To what Purpose then should we seek the
Possession of more Countries, who are already
possess'd of more Land than we can improve,
and of more Wealth than we know what
to do with? Perceiving me very attentive, he
went on thus.</P>
<P>Were these Mountains, <HI>said he,</HI> valued in
<HI>Europe,</HI> according to the Riches to be found
in them, the Viceroy would obtain Orders
from the King, to have strong Forts erected at
the Entrance in, and at the Coming out of
them, as well on the Side of <HI>Chili,</HI> as here; and
strong Garrisons maintained in them, to pre∣vent
foreign Nations la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding, either on our
Side in <HI>Chili,</HI> or on this Side in the <HI>North</HI>
Seas, and taking the Possession from us; he
would then order Thirty thousand Slaves,
Negroes, or <HI>Chilians,</HI> to be constantly em∣ployed,
not only in picking up what Gold
might be found in the Channels of the Water,
which might easily be formed into proper
Receivers, so as that it any Gold washed from
the Rocks, it should soon be found, and be
so secured, as that none of it would escape;
<PB N="113" REF="326"/>
also others, with Miners and Engineers, might
search into the very Rocks themselves, and
would, no doubt, find out such Mines of
Gold, or other secret Stores of it in those
Mountains, as would be sufficient to inrich
the World.</P>
<P>While we omit such Things as these, Se∣ignior,
<HI>says he,</HI> what signifies <HI>Spain</HI> making
new Acquisitions, or the People of <HI>Spain</HI>
seeking new Countries? This vast Tract of
Land you see here, and some Hundreds of
Miles every Way, which your Eye cannot
reach to, is a fruitful, pleasant, and agree∣able
Piece of God's Creation; but perfectly
uncultivated, and most of it uninhabited;
and any Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> that thinks fit to
settle in it, are free to do so, for any thing
we are able to do to prevent them.</P>
<P>But, Seignior, said I, does not his <HI>Catho∣lick</HI>
Majesty claim a Title to the Possession of
it? And have the <HI>Spaniards</HI> no Governor over
it? nor any Ports or Towns, Settlements or
Colonies in it, as is the Case here in <HI>Chili?</HI>
Seignior, replies he, The King of <HI>Spain</HI> is
Lord of all <HI>America;</HI> as well that which he
possesses, as that which he possesses not; that
Right being given him by the Pope, in the
Right of his being a Christian Prince, mak∣ing
new Discoveries for propagating the Chri∣stian
Faith among In<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idels. How far that
may pass for a Title among the <HI>European</HI>
Powers, I know not. I have heard, that it
has always passed for a Maxim in <HI>Europe,</HI>
that no Country, which is not planted by
any Prince or People, can be said to belong
<PB N="114" REF="327"/>
to them; and, indeed, I cannot say, but it
seems to be rational, that no Prince should
pretend to any Title to a Country where he
does not think fit to Plant, and to keep Pos∣session;
for if he leaves the Country unpos∣sessed,
he leaves it free for any other Nation
to come and possess; and this is the Reason
why the former King of <HI>Spain</HI> did not di∣spute
that Right of the <HI>French,</HI> to their Colo∣nies
of <HI>Mississipi</HI> and <HI>Canada;</HI> or the Right of
the <HI>English</HI> to the <HI>Carribee</HI> Islands, or to their
Colonies of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner from the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> in
the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> which lies that Way,
says he (pointing <HI>N. E.</HI>) to the <HI>Fretum Magel∣lanicum,</HI>
which lies that Way (pointing
<HI>S. E.</HI>) which comprehends a vast Number of
Leagues, is called by us, <HI>Coasta Deserta,</HI> be∣ing
unpossessed by <HI>Spain,</HI> and disregarded of
all our Nation: Neither is there one <HI>Spaniard</HI>
in it; nevertheless, you see how fruitful, how
pleasant, and how agreeable a Climate it is;
how apt for Planting and Peopling it seems
to be; and, above all, what a Place of Wealth
here would be behind them, sufficient, and
more than enough, both for them and us;
for we should have no Reason to offer them
any Disturbance; neither should we be in any
Condition to do it, the Passages of the Moun∣tains
being but few and difficult, as you have
seen, and our Numbers not sufficient to do
any thing more than to block them up, to
keep such People from breaking in upon our
Settlements on the Coast of the <HI>South-Seas.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="328"/>
I asked him, If these Notions of his were
Common among those of his Country, who
were settled in <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru?</HI> Or, Whether
they were his own Private Opinions only?
I told him, I believed, the latter, because I
found he acted in all his Affairs upon gene∣rous
Principles, and was for propagating the
Good of Mankind; but that I questioned
whether their Governor of <HI>Old-Spain,</HI> or the
Sub-Governor and Viceroy of <HI>New-Spain,</HI>
acted upon those Notions or no; and since he
had mentioned the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and the Rio
de la Plata, I should take that as an Exam∣ple,
seeing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would never suffer
any Nation to set Foot in that great River,
where so many Countries might have been
discovered, and Colonies planted; though at
the same Time, they had not possessed, or
fully discovered those Places themselves.</P>
<P>He answered me, smiling, Seignior, says
he, You have given the Reason for this your∣self
in that very Part which you think is a
Reason against it. We have a Colony at
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and at the City of <HI>Ascension,</HI>
higher up in the Rio de la Plata; and we are
not willing to let any other Nation settle
there, because we would not let them see how
weak we are, and what a vast Extent of
Land we possess there with a few Men: And
this for Two Reasons.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We are possessed of the Country, and
daily increasing there, and may, in Time,
extend ourselves farther. The great Rivers
<HI>Parana,</HI> and <HI>Paraguay,</HI> being yet left for us
to plant in, and we are nut willing to put
<PB N="116" REF="329"/>
ourselves out of a Capacity of planting far∣ther,
and therefore we keep the Possession.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We have a Communication from
thence with <HI>Peru.</HI> That great River <HI>La Plata</HI>
rises at the City <HI>La Plata,</HI> and out of
the Mountain <HI>Potosi</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> and a great
Trade is carried on by that River; and
it would be dangerous to let Foreigners
into the Secret of that Trade, which they
might intirely cut off; especially when they
should find that small Number of <HI>Spaniards</HI>
which are planted there to preserve it, seeing
there are not Six hundred <HI>Spaniards</HI> in all
that vast Country, which, by the Course of
that River, is more than One thousand Six
hundred Miles in Length.</P>
<P>I confess, said I, these are just Grounds for
your keeping the Possession of that River.
They are so, said he, and the more, because
of so powerful a Colony as the <HI>Portuguese</HI>
have in the <HI>Brasils,</HI> which bound immediately
upon it, and who are always incroaching
upon it from the Land Side, and would glad∣ly
have a Passage up the <HI>Rio Parana</HI> to the
Back of their Colony.</P>
<P>But here, Seignior, says he, the Case dif∣fers;
For we neither take nor keep Possession
here; neither have we one <HI>Spaniard,</HI> as I said,
in the whole Country now before you; and
therefore we call this Country <HI>Coasta Deserta;</HI>
not that it is a Desart, as that Name is gene∣rally
taken to signify a barren, sandy, dry
Country; on the contrary. The infinite, prodi∣gious
Encrease of the <HI>European</HI> black Cattle,
which were brought by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to the
<PB N="117" REF="330"/>
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and let run loose, is a suffici∣ent
Testimony of the Fruitfulness and Rich∣ness
of the Soil, their Number being such,
that they kill above Twenty thousand of them
in a Year, for nothing but the Hides, which
they carry away to <HI>Spain,</HI> leaving the Flesh,
though fat and wholesome, to perish on the
Ground, or be devoured by Birds of Prey.</P>
<P>And the Number is so great, notwith∣standing
all they destroy, that they are found
to wander sometimes in Droves of many
Thousands together, over all the vast Coun∣try
between the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> the City of
<HI>Ascension,</HI> and the <HI>Frontier</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> and
even down into this Country which you see
before us, and up to to the very Foot of
these Mountains.</P>
<P>Well, said I, and is it not a great Pity,
that all this Part of the Country, and in such
a Climate as this is, should lie uncultivated,
or uninhabited rather? for I understand there
are not any great Numbers of People to be
found among them.</P>
<P>It is true, added he, there are some Notions of
People spread about in this Country; but as
the Terror of our People, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> drove
them, at first, from the Sea Coast towards
these Mountains, so the greatest Part of them
continue on this Side still; for towards the
Coast it is very rare that they find any Peo∣ple.</P>
<P>I would have enquired of him about Rivers,
and Navigable Streams, which might be in
this Country; but he told me frankly, That
he could give me no Account of that; only
<PB N="118" REF="331"/>
thus, That if any of the Rivers went away
towards the <HI>North,</HI> they certainly run all
into the great <HI>Rio de la Plata;</HI> but that if
they went <HI>East,</HI> or <HI>Southerly,</HI> they must go
directly to the Coast, which was ordinarily
called, as he said, <HI>La Coasta Deserta,</HI> or, as
by some, <HI>The Coast of</HI> Palagonia; That as to
the Magnitude of those Rivers, he could say
little, but that it could not be rational, but
there must be some very considerable Rivers,
and whose Streams must needs be capable of
Navigation, seeing abundance of Water must
continually flow from the Mountains where
we then were; and its being, at least, Four
hundred Miles from the Sea Side, those small
Streams must necessarily joyn together, and
make large Rivers in the plain Country.</P>
<P>I had enough in this Discourse, fully to
satisfy all my Curiosity, and sufficiently to
heighten my Desire of making the farther
Discoveries which I had in my Thoughts.</P>
<P>We pitch'd bur little Camp here, and set
down to our Repast y for I found, that tho'
we were to go back to lodge, yet my Patron
had taken care we should be furnished suf∣ficiently
for Dinner, and have a good House
to eat it in; that is to say, a Tent, as be∣fore.</P>
<P>The Place where we stood, though we had
come down Hill for a great way, yet seemed
very high from the ordinary Surface of the
Country, and gave us, therefore, an exceed∣ing
fine Prospect of it, the Country declining
gradually for near Ten Miles; and we
thought, as well as the Distance of the Place
<PB N="119" REF="332"/>
would allow us, we saw a great River, but,
as I learned afterwards, It was rather a great
Lake, than a River, which was supplied by
the smaller Rivers, or Rivulets, from the
Mountains, which met there as in a great
Receptacle of Waters, and out of this Lake,
they all issued again in one River; of which
I shall have Occasion to give a farther Ac∣count
hereafter.</P>
<P>While we were at Dinner, I ordered my
Midship-men to take their Observations of
every distant Object, and to look at every
thing with their Glasses; which they did,
and told me of this Lake; but my Patron could
give no Account of it, having never been, as
he said before, one Step farther that Way,
than where we were. However, my Men
shewed me plainly, that it was a great Lake,
and that there went a large River from it
towards the <HI>E. S. E.</HI> and this was enough
for me, for that Way lay all the Schemes I
had laid.</P>
<P>I took this Opportunity to ask my Midship∣men
first, If they had taken such Observations
in their Passage of the Mountains, as that
they were sure they could find their Way
through to this Place again without Guides?
They assured me they could.</P>
<P>Then I put it to them, Whether they
thought it might not be feazible to travel
over that vast level Country to the <HI>North
Seas?</HI> And to make a sufficient Discovery of
the Country, so as that hereafter <HI>Englishmen</HI>
coming to the Coast on that Side of the
<HI>North Seas,</HI> might penetrate to these Golden-Mountains,
<PB N="120" REF="333"/>
and reap the Benefit of the Trea∣sure
without going a prodigious Length about
<HI>Cape Horn,</HI> and the <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> which
was always attended with innumerable Dan∣gers;
and without breaking through the King∣dom
of <HI>Chili,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Settlements,
which, perhaps, we might soon be at Peace
with, and so be shut out that way by our
own Consents?</P>
<P>One of my Men began to speak of the
Difficulties of such an Attempt; The Want
of Provisions, and other Dangers which we
should be exposed to on the Way, but the
other, a bold, brisk Fellow, told me, He
made no Question, but it might be easily
done, and especially because all the Rivers
they should meet with would, of course, run
along with us, so that we should be sure to
have the Tide with us, <HI>as he called it;</HI> And at
last he added, That he would be content to
be one of those Men who should undertake
it, provided he should be assured, that the
Ships would not go away, and pretend that
they could not be found, I told him, We
would talk farther about it; That I had such
a Thing in my Head, and I had a strong In∣clination
to undertake it myself; but that
I could not answer it to leave the Ships,
which depended so much upon my Care of
the Voyage.</P>
<P>After some Talk of the Reasonableness of
such an Undertaking, and the Methods of
performing it, my Second Midship man be∣gan
to come into it, and to think it was pra∣cticable
enough, and added, That though he
<PB N="121" REF="334"/>
used some Cautions in his first hearing Pro∣posals,
yet, if he undertook that Enterprize,
I should find, that he would do as much of
his Duty in it, as another Man; and so he
did at last, as will appear in its Place.</P>
<P>We were, by this Time, preparing to be
satisfied with our Journey, and my Patron
coming to me, and asking, If I was for re∣turning?
I told him, I could not say how
many Days it would be before I should say,
I had enough of that Prospect; but that I
would return when he pleased; only I had
one Question to ask him, which was, Whe∣ther
the Mountains were as full of Gold
on this Side, as they were on the Side of
<HI>Chili?</HI></P>
<P>As to that, <HI>Seignior,</HI> says he, the best Way
to be certain, is to make a Tryal, that you
may be sure we do not speak without
Book; so he called his Gentleman, and ano∣ther
Servant that was with him, and desired
me to call my Two Midship-men, and speak∣ing
something to his own Servants first, in
the Language of the Country, as I suppose,
he turned to me, and said, Come, let us sit
down and repose ourselves, and let them go
all together, and see what they can do.</P>
<P>Accordingly they went away, and, as my
Men told me afterwards, they search'd in
the small Streams of Water, which they found
running, and in some larger Gullies or Chan∣nels,
where they found little or no Water
running; but where, upon hasty Rains, great
Shoots of Water had been used to run, and
where Water stood still in the Holes and
<PB N="122" REF="335"/>
Falls, as I have described once before on the
like Occasion.</P>
<P>They had not been gone above an Hour,
when I plainly heard my Two <HI>Englishmen</HI>
Hollow, which I could easily distinguish from
the Voices of any other Nation, and imme∣diately
I ran out of the Tent, Captain <HI>Mer∣lote</HI>
followed, and I then saw one of my Mid∣ship-men
running towards us, so we went to
meet him, and what with hollowing, and
running, he could hardly speak; but reco∣vering
his Breath, said, He came to desire
me to come to them, if I would see a Sight
which I never saw in my Life. I was eager
enough to go, so I went with him, and left
Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> to go back to the Tent to
my Patron the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Do∣ctor,
who had not so much Share in the Cu∣riosity:
He did so, and they followed fair and
softly.</P>
<P>When we came to the Place, we saw such
a Sight, indeed, as I never saw before; for
there they were sitting down round a little
Puddle, or Hole, as I might call it, of Water,
where, in the Time of Rain, the Water run∣ing
hastily from in a Piece of the Rock, about
Two Foot higher than the rest, had made a
Pit under it with the Fall like the Tail of a
Mill, only much less.</P>
<P>Here they took up the Sand, or Gravel,
with their Hands, and every Handful
brought up with it such a Quantity of Gold,
as was surprizing; for there they sat picking
it out just as the Boys in <HI>Londom,</HI> that go
with a Broom and a Hat, pick out old Iron,
<PB N="123" REF="336"/>
Nails, and Pins out of the Channels, and it
lay as thick.</P>
<P>I stood and looked at them a while, and,
it must be confessed, it was a pleasant Sight
enough; But reflecting immediately, that
there was no End of this, and that we were
only upon the Enquiry, Come away, says I,
laughing, to my Men, and do not stand
picking up of Trash there all Day: Do you
know how far we have to our Lodging?</P>
<P>I can make no guess what Quantity might
have been found here in Places, which had,
for Hundreds of Years, washed Gold from
the Hills, and, perhaps, never had a Man
come to pick any of it up before; But I was
soon satisfied that here was enough, even to
make all the World say they had enough; and
so I called off my People, and came away.</P>
<P>It seems, the Quantity of Gold which is
thus washed down, is not small, since my
Men, enquiring afterwards among the <HI>Chi∣lians,</HI>
heard them talk of the great Lake of
Water which I mentioned just now that we
saw at a Distance, which they call <HI>The Gol∣den-Lake,</HI>
and where was, as they said, pro∣digious
Quantities of it; not that our Men
supposed any Gold was there in Mines, or
in the ordinary Soil, but that the Waters
from the Hills, running with very rapid Cur∣rents
at certain Times in the rainy Seasons,
and after the melting of the Snows, had car∣ried
the Gold so far as that Lake; and as it
has been so, perhaps, from the Days of the
General Deluge, no People ever applying
themselves to gather the least Grain of it up
<PB N="124" REF="337"/>
again, it might well be increased to such<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Quantity, as might intitle that Water to
the Name of <HI>The Golden-Lake;</HI> and all the
little Streams and Sluices of Water that run
into it, deserved the Name of <HI>Golden-Rivers▪</HI>
as much as that of <HI>The Golden-Lake.</HI></P>
<P>But my Business was to know, If the
Gold was here, not to trouble myself to pick
it up: My Views lay another way, and my
End was fully answered; so I came back to
my Patron, and brought all my Men with
me; You live in a Golden Country, <HI>Seig∣nior,
says I,</HI> my Men are stark mad to see
so much Gold, and no-body to pick it up:
Should the World know what Treasure you
have here, I would not answer for it, that
they should not flock hither in Armies, and
drive you all away. They need not do that,
Seignior, says he, for here is enough for them,
and for us too.</P>
<P>We now packed up, and began our Return,
but it was not without Regret that I turned
my Back upon this pleasant Country, the
most agreeable Place, of its kind, that ever
I was at in all my Life, or ever shall be in
again: A Country rich, pleasant, fruitful,
wholesome, and capable of every thing for
the Life of Man, that the Heart could enter∣tain
a Wish for.</P>
<P>But my present Work was to return; so we
mounted our Mules, and had, in the mean
Time, the Pleasure of contemplating what
we had seen, and applying ourselves to such
farther Measures as we had concerted among
us. In about Four Hours we returned to our
<PB N="125" REF="338"/>
Camp, as I called it, and, by the way, we
found, to our no little Pain, that though we
had come down Hill easily, and insensibly
to the Opening, for some Miles, yet we had
a hard pull up Hill to go back again: How∣ever,
we reached to our Tents in good Time,
and made our First Encampment with Plea∣sure
enough, for we were very weary with
the Fatigue of a hard Day's Journey.</P>
<P>The next Day we reached our good <HI>Chilian</HI>'s
Mansion House, or Palace, for such it might
be called, considering the Place, and consi∣dering
the Entertainment; for now he had
some Time to provide for us, knowing we
would come back again.</P>
<P>He met us with Three Mules, and Two
Servants, about a Mile before we came to the
Descent going down to his House, of which I
took Notice before, and this he did to guide
us a Way round to his House, without going
down those uneasy Steps; so we came on our
Mules to his Door, that is to say, On <HI>his</HI>
Mules, for he would have my Patron the <HI>Spa∣niard,
to whom, I observed, he shewed an ex∣traordinary
Respect,</HI> and Captain <HI>Merlote,</HI>
and myself, mount his fresh Mules to carry
us to his House.</P>
<P>When we came thither, I observed he want∣ed
the Assistance of my Patron's Servants for
his Cookery; for though he had provided
abundance of Food, he owned, he knew not
how to prepare it to our Liking; so they
assisted him, and one of my Midshipmen pre∣tending
to cook too, made them roast a Piece
of Venison, and a Piece of a Kid, or young
<PB N="126" REF="339"/>
Goat, admirable well, and putting no Garlick
or Onions into the Sauce, but their own
Juices, with a little Wine; it pleased the <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>
so well, that my Man passed for an
extraordinary Cook, and had the Favour
asked of him, to dress some more after the
same Manner, when we came back to the
<HI>Spaniard</HI>'s House.</P>
<P>We had here several Sorts of wild Fowl,
which the <HI>Chilian</HI> had shot while we were gone;
but I knew none of them by any of the
Kinds we have in <HI>England,</HI> except some <HI>Teal.</HI>
However, they were very good.</P>
<P>The Day was very agreeable and pleasant
here; but the Night dreadful, as before, be∣ing
all Fire and Flame again, and though
we understood both what it was, and where,
yet I could not make it familiar to me, for
my Life. The <HI>Chilian</HI> persuaded us to stay
all the next Day, and did his Endeavour to
divert us as much as possible: My Two
Midship-men went out with him a Hunting,
as he called it, that is, a Shooting; but,
tho' he was a Man of Fifty Years of Age, he
would have killed Ten of them at his Sport,
running up the Hills, and leaping from Rock
to Rock like a Boy of Seventeen. At his
Gun he was so sure a Marksman, that he
seldom missed any thing he shot at, whether
running, flying, or sitting.</P>
<P>They brought home with them several
Fowls, Two Fawns, and full grown Deer,
and we had nothing but boiling, stewing,
and broiling, all that Evening: In the After∣noon,
we walked out to view the Hills, and
<PB N="127" REF="340"/>
to see the stupendous Precipices which sur∣rounded
us. As for looking for Gold, we
saw the Places where there was enough to be
had; but that was become now so familiar to
us, that we troubled not ourselves about it,
as a Thing not much worth while; but our
Two Midship-men, I think, got about the
Quantity of Five or Six Ounces a-piece while
we were chatting, or reposing in the <HI>Chilian</HI>'s
House.</P>
<P>Here it was, that I entred into a Confi∣dence
with my Patron the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> con∣cerning
my Grand Design. I told him, in
the first Place, That my View of the Open
Country beyond these Hills, and the parti∣cular
Account he had given me of it also,
had raised a Curiosity in me, that I could
scarce withstand; and that I had thereupon
form'd a Design, which, if he would further
me with his Assistance, I had a very great
Mind to put in Practice, and that, though I
was to perish in the Attempt.</P>
<P>He told me very readily, Nothing should
be wanting on his Part to give me any Assi∣stance
he could, either by himself, or any of
his Servants; but, smiling, and with abun∣dance
of good Humour, <HI>Seignior, says he,</HI> I
believe I guess at the Design you speak of;
you are fired now with a Desire to traverse
this great Country to the <HI>Coasta Deserta,</HI> and
the <HI>North-S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as;</HI> That is a very great Under∣taking,
and you will be well advised before
you undertake it.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="341"/>
Truly, Seignior, said I, you hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> guessed
my Design, and were it not, that I have
Two Ships under my Care, and some Cargo
of Value on Board, I would bring my whole
Ship's Company on Shore, and make the Ad∣venture,
and, perhaps, we might be strong
enough to defend ourselves against whatever
might happen by the Way.</P>
<P>As to that, Seignior, says he, you would
be in no Danger that would require so many
Men; for you will find but few Inhabitants
any where, and those not in Numbers suffi∣cient
to give you any Trouble; Fifty Men
would be as many as you would either want
or desire, and, perhaps, as you would find
Provisions for; and, for Fifty Men, we
might be able to carry Provisions with us to
keep them from Distress; but if you will ac∣cept
of my Advice, as well as Assistance,
Seignior, says he, choose a faithful strong
Fellow out of your Ship, on whom you can
depend, and give him Fifty Men with him,
or thereabouts, and such Instructions as you
may find needful, as to the Place on the
Coast where you would have them fix their
Stay, and let them take the first Hazards of
the Adventure; and as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you are going round
by Sea, you will, if Success follows, meet
them on the Shore; and if the Account they
give of their Journey encourage you, you
may come afterwards yourself up to these
very Mountains, and take a farther View:
In which Case, he added, with a solemn Pro∣testation,
Cost what it will, I will come
and meet you One hundred Miles beyond the
<PB N="129" REF="342"/>
Hills, with Supplies of Provisions, and Mules
for your Assistance.</P>
<P>This was such wholesome and friendly
Advice, and he offer'd it so sincerely, that
tho' it was very little differing from my own
Design, yet I would not be seen so to lessen his
Prudence in the Measures of his Friendship,
in advising it, as to say, That I had resolv'd
to do so. But, making all possible Acknow∣ledgment
to him for his kind Offers, I told
him, I would take his Advice, and that I
would act just according to the Measures he
had prescrib'd; and at the same time, I
assur'd him, That if I found a convenient
Port to Settle and Fortify in, I would not
fail to come again from <HI>France (for we pass'd
always as acting from</HI> France, <HI>whatever Na∣tion
we were of</HI>) to Relieve and Supply them;
and that if ever I returned safe, I would not
fail to Correspond with him, by the Passages
of the Mountains, and make a better Acknow∣ledgment
for his Kindness, than I had been
able to do yet.</P>
<P>He was going to break off the Dis∣course,
upon the Occasion of the <HI>Chilian</HI>'s
returning, who was just come in from his
Hunting, telling me, We would talk farther
of it by the Way; But I told him, I could
not quite dismiss the Subject; because I must
bespeak him to make some mention of it to the
<HI>Chilian,</HI> that he might, on his Account, be an
Assistant to our Men, as we saw he was capa∣ble
of being, in their passing by those difficult
Ways, and for their Supply or Provision, <HI>&amp;c.
Trouble not your self with that, Seignior,</HI> said
<PB N="130" REF="343"/>
he, <HI>for when your Men come, the Care shall be
mine: I'll come myself as far as this Wealthy</HI>
Chilian'<HI>s, and procure them all the Assistance
this Place can afford them, and do any thing
that offers, to forward them in the Undertaking.</HI></P>
<P>This was so Generous, and so Extraordi∣nary,
that I had nothing to say more, but
to please myself with the apparent Success
of my Attempt, and acknowledge the Hap∣piness
of having an Opportunity to oblige so
generous a Spirited and grateful a Person.</P>
<P>I would, however, have made some farther
Acknowledgment to our <HI>Chilian</HI> Benefactor;
but I had nothing left, except a Couple of
Hats, and Three Pair of <HI>English</HI> Stockings,
One Pair Silk and the other Two Worsted,
and those I gave him, and made him a great
many Acknowledgments for the Favours he
had shewn us, and the next Morning came
away.</P>
<P>We made little Stay any where else in
our Return; but making much such Stages
back as we did forward, we came the Four∣teenth
Day to our Patron's House, having
made the Passage through in something less
than Sixteen Days, and the like back in
Fifteen Days, including our stay at the <HI>Chi∣lian</HI>'s
one Day. The Length of the Way, ac∣cording
to the best of my Calculations, I
reckon'd to be about One Hundred Seventy
Five <HI>English</HI> Miles, taking it with all its
Windings and Turnings, which were not a few;
but which had this Conveniency with them,
That they gave a more easy and agreeable
Passage, and made the <HI>English</HI> Proverb abun∣dantly
<PB N="131" REF="344"/>
good, namely, <HI>That the farthest Way
was the nearest Way.</HI></P>
<P>The Civilities I received after this from
my Generous <HI>Spaniard,</HI> were agreeable to the
rest of his Usage of me; but we, that had so
great a Charge upon us at the Sea-side, could
not spare long Time in those Ceremonies,
any more than I can do now for relating
them. It is enough to mention, That he
would not be excus'd at parting, from going
back with us quite to the Ships, and when I
would have excus'd it, he said, Nay, <HI>Seignior,</HI>
give me leave to go and fetch my Hostages.
In short, there was no resisting him, so we
went all together, having stay'd Two Days
more at his House, and came all safe to our
Ships, having been gone Forty Six Days from
them.</P>
<P>We found the Ships in very good Condition,
all safe on Board and well, except that the
Men seem'd to have contracted something of
the Scurvy; which our <HI>Spanish</HI> Doctor, how∣ever,
soon recovered them of.</P>
<P>Here we found the Two <HI>Spanish</HI> Youths,
our Patron's Hostages, very well also, and
very well pleased with their Entertainment:
One of our Lieutenants had been teaching
them Navigation, and something of the Ma∣thematicks,
and they had made very good
Improvement in those Things, considering
the Time they had been there; and the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
their Father, was so pleased with it, that
having not Gold enough to offer the Lieu∣tenant,
as an Acknowledgment for his Teach∣ing
them, he gave him a very good Ring
<PB N="132" REF="345"/>
from his Finger, having a fine large Emerald
in it of good Value, and made him a long
<HI>Spanish</HI> Compliment, for having nothing of
better Value to offer him.</P>
<P>We now made Preparations for Sailing,
and our Men, in my Absence, had laid in a
very considerable Supply of Provisions, par∣ticularly
excellent Pork, and pretty tolerable
Beef, and a great Number of Goats and Hogs
alive, as many as we could stow.</P>
<P>But I had now my main Undertaking to
manage, I mean that of sending out my little
Army for Discovery, and having communi∣cated
my Design to the Supra Cargo, and the
Person who I intrusted with him in the Com∣mand
of the Ships, they unanimously ap∣prov'd
of the Thing. My next Business was,
To resolve upon whom to confer the Com∣mand
of the Expedition; and this, by general
Consent, fell upon the Lieutenant of the <HI>Ma∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gascar</HI>
Ship, who had taught the young
<HI>Spaniards</HI> Navigation; and this the rather,
because he was naturally a bold, enterprizing
Man▪ and also an excellent Geographer: In∣deed
he was a general Artist, and a Man
faithful and vigilant in whatever he under∣took,
nor was it a little Consideration with
me, that he was so agreeable to the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
and his Sons, of whose Aid we knew he would
stand in to much need.</P>
<P>When I had communicated to him the De∣sign,
and he had both approv'd the Thing
itself, and accepted the Command, we con∣stituted
him Captain, and the Two Midship∣men
we made Lieutenants for the Expedition,
<PB N="133" REF="346"/>
promising each of them Five Hundred Pounds
if they perform'd it: As for the Captain, we
came to a good Agreement with him for his
Reward; for I engaged to give him One
Thousand bounds in Gold as soon as we met,
if the Journey was perform'd effectually.</P>
<P>We then laid open the Undertaking to the
Men, and lest it to every one's Choice to go,
or not to go, as they pleas'd; but instead of
wanting Men to go Voluntier, we were fain
to decide it by Lot, among some of them, they
were all so eager to undertake it.</P>
<P>Then I gave them Articles and Conditions,
which they, who ventur'd, should engage
themselves to comply with, and particularly,
That they should not Mutiny, upon Pain of
being Shot to Death when we met, or upon
the Spot, if the Captain thought it necessary;
That they should not straggle from their Com∣pany,
nor be tempted by the View of pick∣ing
up Gold, to stay behind, when the Com∣pany
beat to March; That all the Gold they
found in the Way, should be in common,
should be put together in Bulk every Night,
and be divided faithfully and equally at the
End of the Journey, allowing only Five
Shares to each Ship, to he divided as I should
direct; besides which, upon Condition, That
every Man behav'd himself faithfully and
quietly, and did their Duty, I promised,
That besides the Gold they might get by the
Way, I would gave them every Man One
Hundred Pounds at our Meeting; and if any
Man was Sick or Maimed by the Way, they
were to engage not to forsake and leave him on
<PB N="134" REF="347"/>
any Account whatsoever, Death only ex∣cepted;
and if any Man died, except by
any Violence from the rest, his Share of the
Gold which was gotten, should be faithfully
kept for his Family, if he had any; but his
Reward of One Hundred Pounds, which was
not due, because he did not live to demand it,
should be divided among the rest: So that by
this Agreement, the Undertaking was not so
dear to me as I had expected; for the Pay of
the Men amounted to no more than the Sum
following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Having pitch'd upon the Men, I landed
them, and made them Encamp on Shore:
But first of all, I made them, every one,
make Wills or Letters of Attorney, or
other Dispositions of their Effects, to such
Persons as they thought fit, with an Account
under their Hands, Endors'd on the Back of
the said Wills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> intimating what Chests
<PB N="135" REF="348"/>
or Cases, or other Things they had on Board,
and what was in them, and what Pay was
due to them; and those Chests, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were
Sealed up before their Faces with my Seal,
and Writings Sign'd by me, the Contents
unknown: Thus they were secure, that all they
had left in the Ships, and all that was due to
them, should be punctually and carefully
kept, and delivered as it was design'd and
directed by themselves; and this was greatly
to their Satisfaction.</P>
<P>As to the Reward of One Hundred Pounds
a Man, and the Articles about keeping to∣gether,
obeying Orders, gathering up Gold,
and the like; I did not read to them 'till
they were all on Shore, and 'till I was ready
to leave them; because if the rest of the Men
had heard it, I should have kept no Body
with me to have sail'd the Ships.</P>
<P>There was as stout a Company of bold,
young, brisk Fellows of them, as ever went
upon any Expedition, Fifty Three in Number,
among them a Surgeon, and his Mate, very
skilful and honest Men both of them; a
Trumpeter and a Drummer, Three Ship-Carpenters,
a Cook, who was also a Butcher
by Trade, and a Barber; Two Shoemakers,
who had been Soldiers among the Pyrates;
a Smith, and a Taylor of the same, so that
they wanted no Mechanicks, whatever might
happen to them.</P>
<P>Give the Fellows their Due, they took but
little Baggage with them; but, however,
what they had, I took Care, with the
Assistance of my good Patron, the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="349"/>
should be as much carried for them as possi∣ble.
I provided them Three large Tents,
made of a Cotton Stuff, which I bought in
the Country, and which we made up on
Board, which Tents were large enough to
cover them all, in case of Rain or Heat; but
as for Beds, or Bedding, they had only Seven
Hammocks, in Case any Man was Sick; for
the rest, they were to shift as well as they
could; the Season was Hot, and the Climate
good; their Way lay in the Latitude of Forty
to Fifty, and they set out in the latter end of
the Month of <HI>October,</HI> which, on that Side of
the Line, is the same as our <HI>April;</HI> so that
the Covering was more to keep them from
the Heat than the Cold.</P>
<P>It was needful, in order to their Defence,
to furnish them with Arms and Ammunition;
so I gave to every Man a Musquet or Fusee,
a Pistol and a Sword, with Cartouches, and a
good Stock of Ammunition, Powder and
Shot, with Three small Barrels at fine Pow∣der
for Store, and Lead in proportion; and
these Things were, indeed, the heaviest Part
of their Baggage, excepting the Carpenters
Tools, and the Surgeons Box of Medicines.</P>
<P>As for the carrying all these Things, they
might easily furnish themselves with Mules or
Horses for Carriage, while they had Money
to pay for them, and you may judge how
that could be wanting, by what has been said
of the Country.</P>
<P>We gave them, however, a good large Pack
of <HI>European</HI> Goods, to make agreeable Pre∣sents
where they received Favours; such as
<PB N="137" REF="350"/>
Black Bays, Pieces of Says, Serge, Calamanca,
Drugget, Hats and Stockings; not forgetting
another Pack of Hatchets, Knives, Sizzers,
Beads, Toys, and such Things, to please the
Natives of the Plain Country, if they should
meet with any.</P>
<P>They desir'd a few Hand-Granadoes, and
we gave them about a Dozen, but as they
were heavy, it would have been very trouble∣some
to have carried more.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> stay'd 'till all this was done,
and 'till the Men were ready to march, and
then told us privately, That it would not be
proper for him to march along with them,
or to appear openly, to countenance the En∣terprize;
That my Two Lieutenants knew
the Way perfectly well; and that he would
go before to his own House, and they should
hear of him by the Way.</P>
<P>All the Mules and Horses which he had
lent us, to bring us back, he left with them
to carry their Baggage, and our new Captain
had bought Six more privately in the Country.</P>
<P>The last Instructions I gave to our Men,
was, That they should make the best of their
Way over the Country beyond the Moun∣tains;
That they should take the exact Di∣stances
of Places, and keep a Journal of their
March, set up Crosses and Markes at all pro∣per
Places; and that they should steer their
Course, as near as they could, between the
Latitude of Forty, where they would enter
the Country, and the Latitude of Forty Five
<HI>South;</HI> in that they would go an <HI>E. S. E.</HI> Course
most of the Way, and that where-ever they
<PB N="138" REF="351"/>
made the Shore, they should seek for a Creek
or Port where the Ships might come to an
Anchor, and look out Night and Day for
the Ships; the Signals also were agreed on,
and they had Two Dozen of Rockets to throw
up, if they discovered us at Sea; they had
all necessary Instruments for Observation
also, and Perspective Glasses, Pocket Com∣passes,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and thus they set out, <HI>October</HI>
24th, 1715.</P>
<P>We stay'd Five Days after they began their
March, by Agreement, That if any Opposi∣tion
had been offer'd them in the Country,
or any Umbrage taken at their Design, so
that it could not be executed, we might have
Notice. But as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Country,
who are the most supinely negligent People
in the World, had not the least Shadow of
Intelligence, and took them only to be <HI>French</HI>
Seamen, belonging to the Two <HI>French</HI> Ships
(such we past for) who had lain there so lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g,
they knew nothing when they went away,
much less whither; but, no question, they
believ'd, that they were all gone on Board
again.</P>
<P>We stay'd Three Days longer than we ap∣pointed,
and hearing nothing amiss from
them, we were satisfy'd that all was Right
with them; so we put to Sea, standing off to
the <HI>West,</HI> 'till we were out of Sight of the
Shore, and then we stood away due <HI>South,</HI>
with a fresh Gale at <HI>N. W.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> and fair
Weather, tho' the Wind chopped about soon
after, and we had Calms and Hot Weather
that did us no good, but made our Men Sick
and Lazy.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="352"/>
The supposed Journey of our Travellers,
their March, and the Adventures they should
meet with by the Way, were, indeed, suffi∣cient
Diversion; and employ'd us all with
Discourse, as well in the Great Cabbin and
Round-House, as afore the Mast, and Wagers
were very rife among us, who shou'd come
first to the Shore of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> for so we
call'd it.</P>
<P>As for the Place, neither they nor we could
make any Guess at what part of the Country
they should make the Sea; but as for us, we
resolved to make the Port St. <HI>Julian</HI> our first
Place to put in at, which is in the Latitude
of Fifty Degrees Five Minutes, and that
then, as Wind and Weather would permit,
we would keep the Coast as near as we
could, 'till we came to <HI>Punta de St. Helena,</HI>
where we would Ride for some Time, and,
if possible, 'till we heard of them.</P>
<P>We had but a cross Voyage to the Mouth
of the Straights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> having contrary
Winds, as I have said, and sometimes bad
Weather; so that it was the Thirteenth of
<HI>December</HI> when we made an Observation, and
found Ourselves in the Latitude of Fifty
Two Degrees Thirty Minutes, which is just
the Height of <HI>Cape Victoria,</HI> at the Mouth of
the Passage. Some of our Officers were very
much for passing the Straights, and not going
about by <HI>Cape Horn;</HI> but the Uncertainty of
the Winds in the Passage, the Danger of the
Currents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made it by no Means advisable,
so we resolved to keep good Sea-room.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="353"/>
The Twenty Fifth of <HI>December,</HI> we found
Ourselves in the Latitude of Sixty two Degrees
Thirty Minutes, and being <HI>Christmas</HI> Day,
I feasted the Men, and drank the Health of
our Travellers; our Course was <HI>S. E.</HI> by <HI>S.</HI>
the Wind <HI>S. W.</HI> then we chang'd our Course
and went away <HI>E.</HI> for Eight Days, and ha∣ving
made fresh Way, stood away, without
Observation, <HI>E. N. E.</HI> and in Two Days
more, made the Land, on the <HI>East</HI> of the
Straight <HI>de la Mare,</HI> so that we were oblig'd
to stand away <HI>E. S. E.</HI> to take more Sea-room,
when the Wind veering to the <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> a fresh
Gale, we stood boldly away due <HI>North,</HI> and
running large, soon found that we were entred
into the <HI>North</HI> Sea, on <HI>Twelfth Day;</HI> for Joy
of which, and to Celebrate the Day, I gave
every Mess a Piece of <HI>English</HI> Beef, and a
Piece of <HI>Chilian</HI> Pork, and made a great Bowl
of Punch afore the Mast, as well as in the
Great Cabbin, which made our Men very
chearful, and, instead of a Twelfth-Cake, I
gave the Cook order to make every Mess a
good Plumb-Pudding, which pleas'd them all
as well.</P>
<P>But while we were at our Liquor, and
merry, the Wind came about to the <HI>N. E.</HI>
and blew very hard, threatning us with a
Storm, and as the Shore lay on our Leeward
Quarter, we were not without Apprehensions
of being driven on some dangerous Places,
and forced to ride upon Life and Death, where
we could have no Shelter; I immediately
therefore, alter'd my Course, and ran away
<HI>East</HI> all Night, to have as much Sea-room as
<PB N="141" REF="354"/>
possible: The next Day the Wind abated, and
haling away to the <HI>East,</HI> we stood <HI>North∣ward</HI>
again, and then <HI>N. W.</HI> in Three Days
more, and we made Land, which appear'd to
be the Head Island of Port St. <HI>Julian,</HI> on the
<HI>North</HI> Side of the Port where we run in,
and about an Hour before Sun-set, came to
an Anchor in Eleven Fathom good holding
Ground, Latitude Forty Nine Degrees Eigh∣teen
Minutes.</P>
<P>We wanted fresh Water, otherwise we
would not have made any stay here at all,
for we knew we were a little too far to the
<HI>South;</HI> however, we were oblig'd to fill fresh
Water here for Three Days together, the
watering Place being a good way up the
River, and the Swell of the Sea running very
high.</P>
<P>During this Interval, Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> and
I went on Shore with about Thirty Men, and
march'd up the Country near Twenty Miles,
getting up to the Top of the Hills, where we
made Fires, and at the farthest Hill we En∣camped
all Night, and threw up Five Rockets,
which was our Signal; but we saw nothing
to answer it, nor any Sign, either of <HI>English</HI>
People or Natives, in all the Country.</P>
<P>We saw a Noble Champian Country, the
Plains all smooth, and cover'd with Grass
like <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain, very little Wood to be
seen any where, insomuch, that we could
not get any thing but Grass to make a Smoke
with, which was another of our Signals.
We shot some Fowls here, and Five or Six
Hares; the Hares are as large as an <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="355"/>
Fox, and Burrow in the Earth like a Rabbet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
The Fowls we shot, were Duck and Mallard
Teal and Widgeon, the same as in <HI>Englan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
in Shape and Size, only the Colour generally
Grey, with White in the Breast, and Gree<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Heads, the Flesh the same as ours, and very
good.</P>
<P>We saw Wild Geese and Wild Swans, but
shot none; we saw, also, Guinacoes o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, as big as small Mules, but
could not come at them neither; for as soon
as we stepp'd towards them, they would call
to one another, to give Notice of us, and
then troop all together, and be gone.</P>
<P>This is an excellent Country for Feeding
and Breeding of Sheep and Horses, the Grass
being short, but very sweet and good on the
Plains, and very long and rich near the fresh
Rivers, and were it Cultivated and Stock'd
with Cattle, would, without doubt, produce
excellent Kinds of all Sorts of Cattle; nor
could it fail of producing excellent Corn, as
well Wheat as Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ley and Oats; and as for
Peas, they grow Wild all over the Country,
and nourish an infinite Number of a Birdlike
Pigeons, which fly in Flights so great,
that they seem in the Air like Clouds at a
great Distance.</P>
<P>As for the Soil, that of the Hills is Gravel
and some Stony, but that of the Pains, is a
light, black Mould, and in some Places a
rich Loam, and some Marle; all of which
are Tokens of Fruitfulness, such as indeed
never fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="356"/>
The Fourteenth of <HI>January</HI> (the Weather
being hot, and Days long, for this was their
<HI>July</HI>) we weighed and stood <HI>Northerly</HI> along
the Shore, the Coast running from Port
St. <HI>Julian N. N. E.</HI> 'till we arriv'd at the fa∣mous
Islands called <HI>Penguin</HI> Islands; and here
we came to an Anchor again, in the same
round Bay which Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI> called
<HI>Port Desire,</HI> it being the Seventeenth of <HI>Ja∣nuary.</HI></P>
<P>Here we found a Post, or Cross, erected
by Sir <HI>John Narborough,</HI> with a Plate of Cop∣per
nailed to it, and an Inscription, signifying,
That he had taken Possession of that Coun∣try
in the Name of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Our
Men raised a Shout for Joy that they were
in their own King's Dominions, or, as they
said, in their own Country; and, indeed,
excepting that it was not inhabited by <HI>English∣men,</HI>
and cultivated, planted, and inclosed,
after the <HI>English</HI> Manner, I never saw a
Country in the World so like <HI>England</HI></P>
<P>Here we victualled our Ships with a new
kind of Food; for we loaded ourselves with
Seals, of which here are an infinite Number,
and which we salted and eat, and our Men
liked them wonderfully for a while; but they
soon began to be weary of them: Also the
<HI>Penguins</HI> are a very wholesome Diet, and
very pleasant, especially when a little salted;
and as for Salt, we could have loaded our
Ship with it, being very good and white,
made by the Sun, and found in standing
Ponds of Salt-water, near the Shore.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="357"/>
The <HI>Penguins</HI> are so easily kill'd, and are
found in such vast Multitudes on that Island,
(which, for that Reason, is so called) that
our Men loaded the Long-boat with them
twice in one Day, and we reckoned there
were no less than Seven thousand in the Boat
each Time.</P>
<P>Here we travelled up into the Country
in Search of our Men, and made our Signals,
but had no Answer to them, nor heard any
Intelligence of them. We saw some People
here at a Distance, scattering about; but
they were but few, nor would they be brought
by any Means to converse with us, or come
near us.</P>
<P>We spread ourselves over the Country
far and wide; and here we shot Hares and
Wild-Fowl again in Abundance, the Country
being much the same as before, but something
more bushy, and here and there a few Trees,
but they were a great way off. There is a
large River which empties itselt into this
Bay.</P>
<P>Finding no News here of our Men, I or∣dered
the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Ship to weigh and stand
farther <HI>North,</HI> keeping as near the Shore as
be might with Safety, and causing his Men
to look out for the Signals, which, if they
discovered, they should give us Notice by
firing Three Guns.</P>
<P>They sailed the Height of <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI>
where the Land falling back, makes a deep
Bay, and the Sea receives into it a great
River at several Mouths, some of them Twen∣ty
Leagues from the other, all farther
<PB N="145" REF="358"/>
<HI>North.</HI> Here they stood into the Bay 'till they
made the Land again; for at the first Open∣ing
of the Bay, they could not see the Bot∣tom
of it, the Land lying very low.</P>
<P>The Captain was doubtful what he should
do upon the Appearance of so large a Bay,
and was loth to stand farther in, lest the
Land, pushing out into the Sea again after∣wards,
and a Gale springing up from Sea∣ward,
they might be shut into a Bay where
they had no Knowledge of the Ground; and
upon this Caution, they resolved among them∣selves
to come to an Anchor for that Even∣ing,
and to put farther out to Sea the next
Morning.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the next Morning, he weigh'd,
and stood off to Sea; but the Weather being
very fine, and the little Wind that blew, be∣ing
<HI>S. W.</HI> by <HI>S.</HI> he ventured to stand in for
the Shore, where he found Two or Three
small Creeks, and one large River, and send∣ing
in his <HI>Shalloup</HI> to sound, and find out a
good Place to ride in, upon their making
the Signal to him, that they had found such
a Place, he stood in, and came to an An∣chor
in Eleven Fathom good Ground, Half
a League from the Shore, and well defend∣ed
from the <HI>Northerly</HI> and <HI>Easterly</HI> Winds,
which were the Winds we had any Reason
to fear.</P>
<P>Having thus brought his Ship to an Anchor,
he sent his <HI>Shalloup</HI> along the Shore to give me
an Account of it, and desire me to come up
to him, which accordingly we did; and here we
resolved to ride for some Time, in hopes
<PB N="146" REF="359"/>
to hear from our little Army. We went on
Shore, some or other of us, every Day, and
especially when Five of our Men, going on
Shore on the <HI>North</HI> Side of the River, had
shot Three <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, and a black wild
Bull; for after that, they ranged the Country
far and near to find more, but could never
come within Shot of them, except Three
Bulls and a Cow, which they kill'd after a
long Chase.</P>
<P>We lay here 'till the Sixteenth of <HI>February,</HI>
without any News of our Travellers, as I
called them. All the Hopes we had, was,
that Five of our Men, asking my Leave to
travel, swore to me, They would go quite
up to the <HI>Andes,</HI> but they would find them;
nay, They would go to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentle∣man
himself, if they did not hear of them;
and obliged me to stay Twenty Days for
them, and no longer. This I promised them,
and giving them every thing they asked, and
Two of the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep to carry their
Ammunition, with Two Dozen of Rockets for
Signals, a Speaking-Trumpet, and a good
Perspective-Glass, away they went; and from
them we had yet heard no News, so that was
our present Hope.</P>
<P>They travelled, as they afterwards gave
an Account, One hundred and Twenty Miles
up the Country, 'till they were at last forced
to resolve to kill one of their <HI>Guinacos,</HI> or
Sheep, to satisfy their Hunger, which was a
great Grief to them; for their Luggage was
heavy to carry; but, I say, they only re∣solved
on it, for just as they were going to
<PB N="147" REF="360"/>
do it, one of them rouzed a Deer with a Fawn,
and, by great good luck, shot them both;
for having killed the Doe, the Fawn stood
still by her, 'till he had loaded his Piece again,
and shot that also.</P>
<P>This supplied them for Four or Five Days
plentifully, and the last Day, one of my
Men, being by the Bank of the River, for
they kept as near the River as they could, in
hopes to hear of them that Way, saw some∣thing
black come driving down the Stream;
he could not reach it, but calling one of his
Fellows, their Curiosity was such, that the
other, being a good Swimmer, stripped, and put
off to it, and when he came to it, he found
it was a Man's Hat; this made them conclude
their Fellows were not far off, and that they
were coming by Water.</P>
<P>Upon this, they made to the first Rising
Ground they could come at, and there they
encamped, and, at Night, fired some Rockets,
(they kept looking out, you may be sure) and
after the Third Rocket was fired, they, to
their great Joy, saw Two Rockets rise up
from the <HI>Westward,</HI> and soon after that, a
Third; and in Two Days more, they all
joyfully met, as you shall hear.</P>
<P>We had been here, as I have said, impa∣tiently
expecting them a great while; but at
last, the Man at the Main-Top, who was
ordered to look out, called aloud to us be∣low,
that he saw a Flash of Fire, and imme∣diately,
the Men looking to Land-ward,
they saw Two Rockets rise up in the Air at a
great Distance, which we answered by firing
<PB N="148" REF="361"/>
Three Rockets again, and they returned by
One Rocket, to signify, that they saw our
Mens Signal.</P>
<P>This was a joyful Exchange of distant
Language to both Sides, but I was not there;
for being impatient, I had put out, and sailed
about Ten Leagues farther; but our Ship
fired Three Guns to give me Notice, which,
however, we heard not, and yet we knew
they fired too; for, it being in the Night,
our Men, who were very attentive with their
Eyes, as well as Ears, saw plainly the Three
Flashes of the Guns, though they could not
hear the Report, the Wind being contrary,
This was such certain Intelligence to me, and
I was so impatient to know how Things went,
that, having also a small all Gale of Wind, I
weighed immediately, and stood back again
to our other Ship; it was not, however, 'till
the Second Day after we weighed, that we
came up to them, having little or no Wind
all the First Day; the next Day, in the Morn∣ing,
they spied us, and fired the Three Guns
again, being the Signal, that they had got
News of our Friends.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more to my Satisfaction,
than to hear, that they had got News, and
it was as much to their Satisfaction as to
ours, to be sure, I mean our little Army; for
if any Disuster had happened to us, they
had been in a very odd Condition, and tho'
they might have found Means to subsist, yet
they would have been out of all Hope of ever
returning to their own Country.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="362"/>
Upon the Signal, I stood into the Bay,
and came to an Anchor at about a League
to the <HI>Northward</HI> of our other Ship, and as
far from the Shore; and, as it were, in the
Mouth of the River, waiting for another Sig∣nal
from our Men, by which we might judge,
which Side of the River to go a Shore at,
and might take some proper Measures to
come at them.</P>
<P>About Five a Clock in the Evening, our
Eyes, being all up in the Air, and towards
the Hills, for the appointed Signals, beheld,
to our great Surprize, a <HI>Canoe</HI> come rowing
to us out of the Mouth of the River; imme∣diately
we went to work with our Perspe∣ctive
Glasses. One said it was one Thing,
and one said it was another, 'till I fetched
out a large Tellescope out of the Cabbin, and
with that I could easily see they were my
own Men, and it was to our inexpressible Satis∣faction,
that they soon after came directly
on Board.</P>
<P>It might very well take up another Vo∣lume,
as large as this, to give a farther Ac∣count
of the Particulars of their Journey, or
rather their Journey and Voyage; How they
got through the Hills, and were entertained
by the generous <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and afterwards by
the Wealthy <HI>Chilian:</HI> How the Men, greedy
for Gold, were hardly brought away from
the Mountains: And how, once, they had
much ado to persuade them not to rob the
honest <HI>Chilian</HI> who had used them so well,
'till my Lieutenant, then their Captain, by
a Stratagem seized on all their Weapons, and
<PB N="150" REF="363"/>
threatned to speak to the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to raise
all the <HI>Chilians</HI> in the Mountains, and have
all their Throats cut; and yet, that even
this did not suffice, 'till the Two Midship∣men,
then their Lieutenants, assured them,
that at the first Opening of the Hills, and in
the Rivers beyond, they would have Plenty
of Gold, and one of the Midshipmen told
them, That if he did not see them have so
much Gold, that they would not stoop to
take up any more, they should have all his
Share to be divided among them, and should
leave him behind in the first desolate Place
they could find.</P>
<P>How this appeased them 'till they came to
the outer Edge of the Mountains, where I
had been, and where my Patron the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
left them, having supplied them with Sixteen
Mules to carry their Baggage, and some Gui∣nacoes,
or Sheep of <HI>Peru,</HI> which would carry
Burthens, and afterwards be good to eat
also.</P>
<P>Also, How here they mutiny'd again, and
would not be drawn away, being insatiable
in their Thirst after the Gold, 'till about
Twenty, more reasonable than the rest, were
content to move forward and, after some
Time, the rest followed, though not 'till they
were assured, that the picking up of Gold
continued all along the River, which began
at the Bottom of the Mountains, and that
it was likely to continue a great way far∣ther.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="364"/>
How they worked their Way down these
Streams, with still an insatiable Avarice and
Thirst after the Gold, to the Lake called
<HI>The Golden-Lake,</HI> and how here they were
astonished at the Quantity they found: How,
after this, they had great Difficulty to fur∣nish
themselves with Provisions, and greater
still, in carrying it along with them 'till
they found more.</P>
<P>I say, All these Accounts might suffice to
make a Volume as large as all the rest: How,
at the farther End of this Lake, they found
that it evacuated itself into a large River,
which, running away, with a strong Current,
to the <HI>S. S. E.</HI> and afterwards to the <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI>
encouraged them to build Canoes, in which
they imbarked, and which River brought
them down to the very Bay where we found
them; but that they met with many Diffi∣culties,
sunk, and staved their Canoes seve∣ral
Times, by which they lost some of their
Baggage, and, in one Disaster, lost a great
Parcel of their Gold, to their great Surprize
and Mortification: How, at one Place, they
split Two of their Canoes, where they could
find no Timber to build new ones, and the
many Hardships they were put to before
they got other Canoes; But I shall give a
brief Account of it all, and bring it into as
narrow a Compass as I can.</P>
<P>They set out, as I have said, with Mules
and Horses to carry their Baggage, and the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> gave them a Servant with them for
a Guide, who carrying them By ways, and
Unfrequented, so that they might give no
<PB N="152" REF="365"/>
Alarm at the Town of <HI>Villa Rica,</HI> or any where
else, they came to the Mouth of the
Entrance into the Mountains, and there they
pitched their Tent.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B. The Lieutenant who kept their Jou∣rnal,
giving an Account of this, merrily,
In his Sea Language, expresses it thus;</HI>
Being all come safe into the Opening that
is in the Entrance of the Mountains, and
being there free from the Observation of
the Country, we called it our first Port, so
we brought <HI>too,</HI> and came <HI>to an Anchor.</HI></Q>
<P>Here the generous <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who, at his
own Request, was gone before, sent his Gen∣tleman,
and one of his Sons, to them, and
sent them Plenty of Provisions, as also caused
their Mules to be changed for others that were
fresh, and had not been fatigued with any
of the other Part of the Journey.</P>
<P>These Things being done, the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s
Gentleman caused them to decamp, and march
Two Days farther into the Mountains, and
then they encamped again, where the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
himself came <HI>Incognito</HI> to them, and, with
the utmost Kindness and Generosity, was
their Guide himself, and their Purveyor also,
though Two or Three Times, the Fellows
were so rude, so ungovernable, and unbound∣ed
in their hunting after Gold, that the <HI>Spa∣niard</HI>
was almost frighted at them, and told
the Captain of it: Nor, indeed, was it alto∣gether
without Cause for the Dogs were so
ungrateful, that they robbed Two of the
<PB N="153" REF="366"/>
Houses of the <HI>Chilians,</HI> and took what Gold
they had, which was not much indeed, but it
hazarded so much the Alarming the Coun∣try,
and raising all the <HI>Mountaineers</HI> upon
them, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was upon the Point
of flying from them, in Spight of all their
Fire-Arms and Courage.</P>
<P>But the Captain begged him to stay one
Night more, and promised to have the Fellows
punished, and Satisfaction to be made; and so
he brought all his Men together and talked
to them, and enquired who it was: But ne∣ver
was such a piece of Work in the World:
When the new Captain came to talk of who
did it, and of Punishment, they cryed, They
all did it, and they did not value all the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Indians</HI> in the Country; they
would have all the Gold in the whole Moun∣tain,
ay, that they would, By—and
swore to it, and if the <HI>Spaniard</HI> offer'd to
speak a Word to them, they would whip his
Head off, and the like.</P>
<P>However, a little Reasoning with them,
brought some of the Men to their Senses, and
the Captain, who was a Man of Sense and of
a smooth Tongue, managed so well, that he
brought about 22 of the Men, and the Two
Lieutenants and Surgeons to declare for his
Opinion, and that they would act better for the
future; and with these, he clapt in between
the other Fellows, and separated about 18
of them from their Arms, for they had run
scattering among the Rocks to hunt for Gold,
and when they were called to this Parley, had
not their Weapons with them: By t his
<PB N="154" REF="367"/>
Stratagem he seized Eleven of the Thieves,
and made them Prisoners; and then he told the
rest in so many Words, that if they would not
comply to keep Order, and obey the Rules
they were at first sworn to, and had promised,
he would force them to it, for he would de∣liver
them, bound Hand and Foot, to the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and they should do the poor
<HI>Chilians</HI> Justice upon them, for that, in short,
he would not have the rest murthered for them;
upon this, he ordered his Men to draw up, to
shew them he would be as good as his Word,
but they considered of it, and submitted.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had taken a wiser Course
than this, or, perhaps, they had been all mur∣thered;
for, he ran to the two <HI>Chilian</HI> Houses
where the Rogues had plunder'd, and where,
in short, there was a kind of little Hubbub
about it, and with good Words, promising
to give them as much Gold as they lost, and the
Price of some other Things that were taken
away, he appealed the People; and so our
Men were not ruined, as they would certainly
have been, if the Mountaineers had taken the
Alarm.</P>
<P>After this, they grew a little more gover∣nable,
but, in short, the Sight of the Gold, and
the easy getting it, for they pick'd it up in
abundance of Places; I say, the Sight of the
Gold, made them stark mad; for now, they
were not as they were before, trafficking for
the Owners and for the Voyage: But, as I had
promised the Gold they got should be their
own, and that they were now Working for
themselves, there was no getting them to go
<PB N="155" REF="368"/>
on, but, in short, they would dwell here; and
this was as fatal a Humour as the other.</P>
<P>But to bring this part of the Voyage to an
End, after Eight Days they came to the
Hospitable Wealthy <HI>Chilian's</HI> House, who I
mention'd before; and here, as the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
had contriv'd it, they found all kind of need∣ful
Stores for Provisions laid up, as it were, on
purpose; and, in a Word, here they were not
Fed only, but Feasted.</P>
<P>Here again, the Captain discovered a cursed
Conspiracy, which, had it taken Effect, would,
besides the Baseness of the Fact, have ended in
their total Destruction; in short, they had
resolved to rob this <HI>Chilian</HI> who was so kind to
them; but, as I said, one of the Lieutenants dis∣covered
and detected this villainous Contri∣vance,
and quash'd it, so as never to let the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> know of it.</P>
<P>But, I say, to end this Part; They were One
and Twenty Days in this Traverse, for they
could not go on so easy and so fast, now they
were a little Army, as we did, who were
out Six or Seven; At length they came to the
View of the open Country, and, being all
Encamped, at the Edge of a Descent, the
Generous <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and his three Servants,
took his Leave, wishing them a good Journey,
and so went back, having the Day before,
brought them some Deer, Five or Six Cows
and some Sheep, for their Subsisting at their
Entrance into, and Travel thro' the plain
Country.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="369"/>
And now they began to descend towards the
Plain, but they met with more Difficulty
here than they expected; for, as I observed,
that the Way, for some Miles, went with an
Ascent, towards the farthest part of the Hill,
that continued Ascent, had by Degrees,
brought them to a very great, and, in some
Places, an unpassable Descent, so that, how∣ever
my Guide found his Way down,
when I was through, it was not so easy for
them to do it, who were so many in Number, and
incumbred with Mules and Horses, and
with their Baggage, so that they knew not what
to do; and if they had not known that our
Ships were gone away, there had been some
Odds, but, like the old <HI>Israelites,</HI> they would
have murmured against their Leader, and
have all gone back to <HI>Egypt.</HI> In a Word,
they were at their Wits End, and knew not
what Course to take for two or three Days,
trying and essaying to get down here and
there, and then frighted with Precipices and
Rocks, and climbing up to get back again;
the whole of the Matter was, that they had
miss'd a narrow Way, where they should have
turn'd off to the <HI>S. E.</HI> the Marks which our
Men had made before, having not been so
regular and exact just there, as in other
Parts of the Way, or some other Turning
being so very like the fame, that they took
one for the other; and thus going straight
forward too far, before they turn'd, they
came to an Opening indeed, and saw the plain
Country under them, as they had done before;
but the Descent was not so practicable.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="370"/>
After they had puzzled themselves here, as
I said, two or three Days, one of the Lieute∣nants
and a Man with him, seeing a Hut or
House of a <HI>Chilian</HI> at some Distance, rode
away towards it; but passing into a Valley
that lay between, he met with a River which
he could by no means get over with the Mules;
so he came back again in Despair: The Cap∣tain
then resolved to send back to the honest
rich <HI>Chilian,</HI> who had entertained them so
well, for a Guide, or to desire him to give them
such Directions, as they might not mistake.</P>
<P>But as the Person sent back, was one of
those who had taken the Journal which I
mentioned, and was therefore greatly vek'd at
missing his Way in such a Manner; so he had
his Eyes in every Corner, and pulled out his
Pocket-Book at every Turning, to see how the
Marks of Places agreed; and at last, the
very next Morning after he set out, he
spied the Turning where they should all have
gone in, to have come to the Place which they
were at before: This being so remarkable a
Discovery, he came back again directly, with∣out
going on to the <HI>Chilian's</HI> House, which was
two Days Journey farther.</P>
<P>Our Men were reviv'd with this Discovery,
and all agreed to march back; so, having lost
about Six Days in this false Step, they got in∣to
the right Way, and in Four more, came to
the Descent, where I had been before.</P>
<P>Here the Hill was still very high, and the
Passage down, was steep and difficult enough;
but still, it was practicable, and our Men
could see the Marks of Cattle having pass'd
<PB N="158" REF="371"/>
there, as if they had gone in Drifts or Droves;
also it was apparent, that, by some Help and
Labour of Hands, the Way might be led
Winding and Turning on the Slope of the Hill,
so as to make it much easier to get down than it was now.</P>
<P>It cost them no small Labour, however, to
get down, chiefly because of the Mules, which
very often fell down with their Loads, and our
Men said, they believ'd, they could, with much
more Ease, have mounted up from the <HI>East</HI> Side
to the Top, than they came from the <HI>West</HI> Side
to the Bottom.</P>
<P>They incamped one Night on the Declivity
of the Hill, but got up early, and was at the
Bottom and on the plain Ground by Noon:
As soon as they came there, they incamped
and refreshed themselves, <HI>that is to say,</HI> went
to Dinner; but it being very hot there, the
cool Breezes of the Mountains having now left
them, they were more inclined to Sleep than
to Eat; so the Captain ordered the Tent to
be set up, and they made the whole Day of it,
calling a Council in the Morning to consider
what Course they should steer, and how they
should go on.</P>
<P>Here they came to this Resolution, That
they should send a Man or two, a considerable
Way up the Hill again, to take the strictest
Observation he could of the Plain, with the
largest Glasses they had, and to mark which
Way the nearest River or Water was to be
seen; and they should direct their Course, first
to the Water, and that if the Course of it lay
S. or any way to the E. of the S. they would
<PB N="159" REF="372"/>
follow on the Bank of It, and as soon as it was
large enough to carry them, they would make
them some Canoes or Shaloups, or what they
could do, with the most Ease, to carry them
on by Water, also they directed him to observe
if he could see any Cattle feeding at a Distance,
or the like.</P>
<P>The Messenger returned, and brought them
Word, that all the Way to the <HI>E.</HI> and so on
to <HI>S. E</HI> they could discover nothing of Water,
but that they had seen a great Lake or Lough
of Water at a great Distance, which looked
like a Sea, and lay from them to the <HI>Northward</HI>
of the <HI>East,</HI> about two Points; adding, That
they did not know, but it might afterwards
empty it self to the <HI>Eastward,</HI> and it was their
Opinion to make the best of their Way
thither.</P>
<P>Accordingly the next Morning they de∣camped
and marched <HI>E. N. E.</HI> very chearfully,
but found the Way much longer than they
expected; for though from the Mountains, the
Country seemed to lie flat and plain, yet when
they came, to measure it by their Feet, they
found a great many little Hills; Little, I say,
compared to the great Mountains, but Great
to them who were to Travel over them in the
Heat, and with but very indifferent Support as
to Provisions, so that in a Word, the Captain
very prudently ordered, that they should travel
one three Hours in the Morning, and three
Hours in the Evening, and incamp in the Heat
of the Day, to refresh themselves as well as
they could.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="373"/>
The best Thing they met with in that Part
of the Country, was, That they had Plenty of
Water; for though they were not yet come to
any large considerable River, yet, every low
piece of Ground, had a small Rill of Water in
it; and the Springs coming out from the rising
Grounds, on the Sides of the Mountains, being
innumerable, made many such small Brooks.</P>
<P>It cost them Six Days Travel, with Two Days
resting between, to advance to that River of
Water, which, from the Height of the Moun∣tains,
seemed to be but a little Way off; They
could not march, by their Computation, above
Ten or Twelve Miles a Day, and rest every
third Day too, for their Luggage was heavy
and their Mules but few; also some of their
Mules tyred and jaded, by their long March,
or fell lame, and were good for nothing.</P>
<P>Besides all this, the Days which I call Days
of Rest, were really not so to them, for those
Intervals were imployed to range about and
hunt for Food; and it was for that, more than
for Want of Rest, that they halted every
Third Day.</P>
<P>In this Exercise they did, however, meet with
such Success, that they made shift to kill one sort
of Creature or another every Day, sufficient to
keep them from famishing, sometimes they
met with some Deer, other times with the
<HI>Guinacoes</HI> or <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, and sometimes
with Fowls of several kinds, so that they did
pretty well for Food: At length, <HI>viz.</HI> the Se∣venth
Day, they came to a River, which was at
first small, but having received another small
River or two from the <HI>Northern</HI> Part of the
<PB N="161" REF="374"/>
Country, began to seem large enough for
their Purpose, and as it ran <HI>E. S. E.</HI> they con∣cluded
it would run into the Lake, and that
they might Fleet down this River, if they
could make any thing to carry them.</P>
<P>But their first Discouragement was, the
Country was all open, with very little Wood,
and no Trees, or very few, to be found large
enough to make <HI>Canoes,</HI> or Boats of any Sort;
but the Skill of their Carpenters, of which they
had Four, soon conquered this Difficulty; for
coming to a low swampy Ground, on the Side
of the River, they found a Tree something like
a Beech, very firm good sort of Wood; and yet
soft enough to Work easy; and they went to
Work with this, and, at first, made them some
Rafts,; which they thought might carry
them along, till the River was bigger.</P>
<P>While this was doing (which took up two or
three Days) the Men straggled up and down;
some with their Guns to shoot Fowls, some
with Contrivances to catch Fish, some one
thing, some another; when, on a sudden, one
of their Fishermen, not in the River, but in a
little Brook, which afterwards run into the
River, found a little bit of shining Stuff among
the Sand, or Earth, in the Bank; and one
cryed, he had found a piece of Gold: Now it
seems all was not Gold that glister'd, for
the Lump had no Gold in it, whatever it was;
but the Word being given out at first, it im∣mediately
set all our Men a Romaging the
Shores of every little Rill of Water they came
at, to see if there was no Gold; and they had
not looked long, but they found several little
<PB N="162" REF="375"/>
Grains of Gold very small and fine, not only
in this Brook, but in several others: So they
spent their Time the more chearfully, because
they made some Purchase.</P>
<P>All this while they saw no People, nor any
Signals of any, except once on the other Side
of the River, at a great Distance, they thought
they saw about Thirty together, but whether
Men or Women, or how many of each, they
could not tell, nor would they come any
nearer; only stood and gazed at our People at
a Distance.</P>
<P>They were now ready to quit their Camp
and embark, intending to lay all their Bag∣gage
on the Rafts, with three or four Sick
Men, and so the rest to march by the River∣Side,
and as many as could, to ride upon the
Mules; when, on a sudden, all their Naviga∣tion
was put to a Stop, and their new Vessels,
such as they were, suffered a Wreck: The
Case was thus, They had observed a great
many black Clouds to hang over the Tops of
the Mountains, and some of them even below
the Tops, and they did believe it rained
among the Hills, but in the Plain where they
lay, and all about them, it was fair, and
the Weather fine.</P>
<P>But in the Night, the Carpenters and their
Assistants, who had set up a little Tent near
the River Side, were alarmed with a great
roaring Noise (as they thought) in the River,
tho' at a Distance upwards; presently after,
they found the Water begin to come into
their Tent; when, running out, they found the
<PB N="163" REF="376"/>
River was swelling over its Banks and all the
low Grounds on both Sides of them.</P>
<P>To their great Satisfaction it was just break
of Day, so that they could see enough to make
their Way from the Water, and the Land
Very happily rising a little to the <HI>S.</HI> of the
River, they immediately fled thither; two of
them had so much Presence of Mind with
them, as to pick up their Working Tools, at
least some of them, and carry off, and the
Water rising gradually, the other two Car∣penters
ventured back to save the rest; but
they were put to it to get back again with
them; in a Word, the Water rose to such a
Height, that it carried away their Tent, and
every Thing that was in it, and, which was
worse, their Rafts, (for they had almost fi∣nished
Four large Rafts) were all lifted
off from the Place where they were fram'd,
which was a kind of a dry Dock, and dash'd
all to Pieces, and the Timber, such as it was,
all carried away: The smaller Brooks also
swell'd in Proportion to the larger River;
so that, in a Word, our Men lay, as it were,
surrounded with Water, and began to be in
a terrible consternation; for tho' they lay
in a hard dry Piece of Ground, too high for
the Land-Flood to reach them, yet had the
Rains continued in the Mountains, they
might have lain there till they had been oblig'd
to cat one another, and so there had been an
End of our new Discovery.</P>
<P>But the Weather clear'd up among the Hills
the next Day, which hearten'd them up again;
and as the Flood rose so soon, so the Current
<PB N="164" REF="377"/>
being furiously rapid, the Waters run off a∣gain
as easily as they came on, and in Two
Days the Water was all gone again. But our
little Float was shipwreck'd, as I have said, and
the Carpenters finding how dangerous such
great unweildy Rafts would be, resolved to set
to it, and build one large Float with Sides to it
like a Punt or Ferry-boat. They work'd so
hard at this, Ten of the Men always work∣ing
with them to help, that in Five Days
they had her finished: The only Thing they
wanted was Pitch and Tar, to make her Up∣per-Work
keep out the Water; and they
made a Shift to fetch a Juice out of some of
the Wood they had cut, by Help of Fire,
that answered the End tolerably well.</P>
<P>But that which made this Disappointment
less afflicting, was, That our other Men hun∣ting
about the small Streams where this Wa∣ter
had come down so furiously, found that
there was more Gold, and the more for the
late Flood. This made them run straggling
up the Streams; and, as the Captain said,
he thought once they would run quite back
to the Mountains again.</P>
<P>But that was his Ignorance too, for after a
while, and the nearer they came to the Rising
of the Hills, the Quantity abated; for where
the Streams were so furious, the Water wash'd
it all away, and carried it down with it; so
that by the End of Five Days the Men found
but little, and began to come back again.</P>
<P>But then they discovered, that, tho' there
was less in the higher Part of the Rivers,
there was more farther down, and they found
<PB N="165" REF="378"/>
it so well worth while, that they went fish∣ing
along for Gold all the Way towards the
Lake, and left their Fellows and the Boat to
come after.</P>
<P>At last, when nothing else would do it,
Hunger call'd them off, and so, once more,
they got all their Company together again;
and now they began to load the Float, indeed
it might be call'd a Luggage Boat: However,
it answered very well, and was a great Relief
to our Men; but when they came to load it,
they found it would not carry so much by a
great deal as they had to put in it, besides,
that they would be all oblig'd to march on
Foot by the Shore, which had this particular
Inconvenience in it, That whenever they came
to any small River or Brook, which run into
the other, as was very often the Case, they
would be forc'd to march up a great Way to
get over it, or unload the great Float to
make a Ferry-boat of it to wast them over.</P>
<P>Upon this, they resolved, that the first Place
they came at, where Stuff was to be had for
building, they would go to work again, and
make Two or Three more Floats not so big as
the other, that so they might embark them∣selves,
and their Stuff, and their Provisions too
all together, and take the full Benefit of the
River, where it would afford them Help, and
not some foil on the Water, and some go on
Foot upon the Land, which was very fatigue∣ing.</P>
<P>Upon this, as soon as they found Stuff, as
I have said, and a convenient Place, they
went all Hands to work to build more Floats
<PB N="166" REF="379"/>
or Boats, call them as you will: While this
was doing, all the spare Men, and all the
Men at spare Hours, spent their Time and
Pains in Hunting about for Gold in the Brooks
and small Streams, as well those they had
been at before, as others; and that after they
had, as it were, plundered them at the first
Discovery, for as they had found some Gold
after the hasty Rain, they were loth to give
it over, tho' they had been assured there was
more to be found in the Lake where they
were yet to come, than in the Brooks.</P>
<P>All this while their making the Floats went
slowly on, for the Men thought it a great
Hardship to keep chopping of Blocks, as they
call'd it, while their Fellows were picking up
of Gold, tho' they knew they were to have
their Share of what they found, as much as
if they had been all the while with them:
But, it seems, there is a kind of Satisfaction
in the Work of picking up Gold, besides the
meer Gain.</P>
<P>However, at Length, the Gold failing, they
began to think of their more immediate
Work, which was going forward; and the
Carpenters having made Three more Floats
like flat-bottom'd Barges, which they brought
to be able to carry their Baggage and them∣selves
too, if they thought fit, they began
to embark and fall down the River, but they
grew sick of their Navigation in a very few
Days; for before they got to the Lake, which
was but Three Days going, they run several
Times on Ground, and were oblig'd to lighten
them to get them off again, then load again,
<PB N="167" REF="380"/>
and lighten again, and so off and on, till they
were so tired of them; that they would much
rather have carried all their Baggage, and have
travelled by Land: And at last they were
forced to cast off Two of them, and put all
their Baggage on Board the other Two, which,
at best, tho' large, were but very poor crazy
Things.</P>
<P>At length, they came in Sight of their be∣loved
Lake, and the next Day they entred
into the open Part or Sea of it, which they
found was very large, and in some Places
very deep.</P>
<P>Their Floats, or what they might be call'd,
were by no Means fit to carry them upon
this Inland Sea; for as, if the Water had
been stirred by the least Gust of Wind, it
would presently have washed over them, and
have spoiled, if not sunk, their Baggage;
so they had no Way to steer or guide them
whenever they came into deep Water where
they could not reach the Ground with their
Poles.</P>
<P>This oblig'd them, as soon as they came into
the open Lake, to keep close under one Shore,
<HI>that is to say,</HI> to the Right-hand, where the
Land falling away to the <HI>S.</HI> and the <HI>S. and by
E.</HI> seemed to carry them still forward on their
Way; the other Side widening to the N. made
the Lake seem there to be really a Sea, for
they could not see over it unless they went on
Shore, and got up upon some rising Ground.</P>
<P>Here, at first, they found the Shore steep
too, and a great Depth of Water close to the
Land, which made them very uneasy; for if
<PB N="168" REF="381"/>
the least Gale of Wind had disturbed the Wa∣ter,
especially blowing from off the Lake, they
would have been shipwreck'd close to the Shore.
However, after they had gone for Two Days
along the Side, by the Help of Towing and
Setting as well as they could, they came to
a flatter Shore and a fair Strand, to their great
Joy and Satisfaction.</P>
<P>But if the Shore prov'd to their Satisfacti∣on
for its Safety, it was much more so on ano∣ther
Account, for they had not been long here,
before they found the Sands or Shore infinitely
rich in Gold, beyond all they had seen, or
thought of seeing, before. They had no soon∣er
made the Discovery, but they resolv'd to
fall on, as upon a lasting Spoil that was to
inrich them all, and they went to work with
such an avaricious Rage, that they seemed
to be as if they were plundring an Enemy's
Camp, and that there was an Army at Hand
to drive them from the Place; and, as it
prov'd, they were in the right to do so; for
in this Gust of their greedy Appetite,
they considered not where they were, and
upon what tender ticklish Terms their
Navigation stood. They had indeed drawn
their Two Floats to the Shore as well as they
could, and with Pieces of Wood, like Piles,
stuck in on every Side, brought them to ride
easy, but had not taken the least Thought
about Change of Weather, tho' they knew
they had neither Anchor or Cable, nor so
much as a Rope large enough to fasten them
on the Shore.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="382"/>
But they were taught more Wit to their
Cost in Two or Three Days; for the very se∣cond
Night, they felt a little unusual Rising of
the Water, as they thought, tho' without any
Wind; and the next Morning, they found
the Water of the Lake was swelled about Two
Foot perpendicular, and that their Floats,
by that Means, lay a great Way farther
from the Shore than they did before, the Wa∣ter
still increasing.</P>
<P>This made them, at first, imagine there
was a Tide in the Lake, and that after a lit∣tle
Time it would abate again; but they soon
found their Mistake; for, after some Time,
they perceived the Water, which was perfect∣ly
fine and clear before, grew, by Degrees, of
a paler Colour, thick, and whitish, till at
last it was quite white and muddy, as is usu∣al
in Land Floods <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and as it still continued
rising, so they continued thrusting in their
Floats farther and farther towards the Shore,
till they had, in short, lost all the fine Gol∣den
Sands they were upon before, and found
the Lake overflowed the Land so far beyond
them, that, in short, they seemed to be in
the Middle of the Lake, for they could scarce
see to the End of the Water, even on that
very Side where, but a few Hours before,
they were fast on Shore.</P>
<P>You may easily judge, that this put them
into a great Consternation, and they might
well conclude, that they should be all drown∣ed
and lost; for they were now, as it were,
in the Middle of the Sea upon Two open
Floats or Rafts, fenc'd no where from the
<PB N="170" REF="383"/>
least Surge or Swell of the Water, except by
a kind of waste Board, about Two Foot
high, built up on the Sides, without any
Caulking or Pitching, or any Thing to keep
out the Water.</P>
<P>They had neither Mast or Sail, Anchor or
Cable, Head or Stern, no Bows to fence off
the Waves, or Rudder to steer any Course,
or Oars to give any Motion, but, like a flat∣bottomed
Punt; they thrust them along
with such Poles as they had, some of which
were about Eight or Ten Foot long, and,
which gave them a little Way, but very
slowly.</P>
<P>All the Remedy they had in this Case, was
to set on with their Poles towards the Shore,
and to observe by their Pocket-Compasses
which Way it lay: And this they laboured
hard at, lest they should be lost in the Night,
and not know which Way to go.</P>
<P>Their Carpenters, in the mean Time, with
some spare Boards which they had, or rather
made, raised their Sides as well as they
could, to keep off the Wash of the Sea, if
any Wind should rise so as to make the Wa∣ter
rough, and thus they fenced against eve∣ry
Danger as well as they could, tho' all
put together, they were but in a very sorry
Condition.</P>
<P>Now they had Time to reflect upon their
voracious Fury, in ranging the Shore to pick
up Gold, without considering where, and
in what Condition they were, and without
looking out on Shore for a Place of Safety: Nay
they might now have reflected on the
<PB N="171" REF="384"/>
Madness of venturing out into a Lake or In∣land
Sea of that vast Extent, in such pitiful
Bottoms as they had under them. Their Bu∣siness,
doubtless, had been to have stopp'd
within the Mouth of the River, and found
a convenient Place to land their Goods and
secure their Lives; and when they had pitched
their Camp upon any safe high Ground,
where they might be sure they could neither
be overflowed or surrounded with Water,
they might have search'd the Shores of
the Lake as far as they thought fit; But thus
to launch out in an unknown Water, and in
such a Condition, as to their Vessels, as is de∣scribed
above, was most unaccountably rash
and inconsiderate.</P>
<P>Never was a Crew of Fifty Men, all able
and experienced Sailors so embarked, nor
drawn into such a Snare; for they were sur∣rounded
with Water for Three or Four Miles
in Breadth on the nearest Shore, and this all
on a sudden, the Country lying low and flat
for such a Breadth; all which appear'd dry
Land, and Green, like the Fields, but the Day
before; and, without Question, they were suf∣ficiently
surprized.</P>
<P>Now they would have given all the Gold
they had got, which was very considerable
too, to have been on Shore on the wildest and
most barren Part of the Country, and would
have trusted to their own Diligence to get
Food: But here, besides the imminent Dan∣ger
of Drowning, they might also be in Dan∣ger
of Starving, for had their Floats ground∣ed
but upon any little Hillock, they might
<PB N="172" REF="385"/>
have stuck there till they had starved and pe∣rished
for Hunger: Then they were in the
utmost Anxiety too, for fear of wetting their
Powder, which if it had happened, they could
never have made serviceable again, and with∣out
if they could not have killed any Thing
for Food, if they had got to the Shore.</P>
<P>They had, in this Exigence, some Comforts
however, which might a little uphold their
Spirits; and without which, indeed, their
Condition must have been deplorable and de∣sperate.
1. It was hot Weather, so that, as
they had no Shelter against the Cold if it had
come, they had no Cold to afflict them;
but they rather wanted Aunings, to keep off the
Sun, than Houses to keep off the Cold. 2.
The Water of the Lake was all fresh and ve∣ry
good, even when it looked white and thick,
yet it was very sweet and drank wholesome
and good tasted: Had it been salt Water,
and they thus in the Middle of it, they must
have perished for Thirst. 3. They being now
floating over the drowned Lands only, the
Water was not very deep, so that they could
reach Ground, and set along their Rafts with
their Poles; and this, to be sure, they failed
not to do with the utmost Diligence.</P>
<P>They had also the Satisfaction to observe,
tho' it was not without Toiling in an inex∣pressible
Manner, that they did gain upon
the Shore; and there was a high Land be∣fore
them, which they did draw towards, tho'
very slowly, and at a very great Distance.</P>
<P>But then they had another Discouragement,
namely, that they saw the Day declined, and
<PB N="173" REF="386"/>
Night came on apace, and, in short, that it
was impossible they could reach the high Land,
which they saw, by Daylight, nor did they
know what to do, or how to go on in the Night.</P>
<P>At Length, Two bold Fellows offered
themselves to strip and go off, either to wade
or swim to the Shore, which they had yet
Daylight enough to do, being, as they judged,
about Three Miles, tho' they found it above
Four Miles; and from thence to find Means
to make a Fire or Light, to guide them to
the Shore in the Dark.</P>
<P>This was, indeed, a desperate Attempt,
but the Two Fellows being good Swimmers,
and willing to venture, it was not impracti∣cable.
They had light Linnen Drawers on,
open at the Knees, and their Shirts; and they
took a little Bottle each in their Pockets, with
some Gun-powder in them close stopped, with
other Materials for kindling Fire; Weapons
they had none, but each Man a Knife and a
Hatchet fasten'd round their Waste in a lit∣tle
Belt, and a light Pole in their Hands to
help when they waded, which they expected
to do most Part of the Way. They had no
Provisions with them, but a Bottle with some
good Brandy in their Pockets.</P>
<P>When they went off, you are to suppose
the Water about Four Foot to Five Foot
deep, so they chose to swim rather than wade,
and, as it was very seldom much deeper, they
had often Opportunity to stand on the firm
Ground to rest themselves.</P>
<P>In this Posture they went on directly to∣wards
the Land, and after they had by swim∣ming
<PB N="174" REF="387"/>
and wading together, advanced about
a Mile, they found the Water grew shallower
which was a Signal to them that they should
reach the hard Ground in a little Time; so
they walked chearfully on in about Three
Foot Water for near a Mile more.</P>
<P>Their Companions soon lost Sight of them,
for they being in White, and the Water white
too, and the Light declining, they could not
see them at a Mile's Distance; after this, they
found the Ground falling lower, so that they
had deeper Water, for Half a Mile more
all the Way; after which, they came to flat
Ground again for near Two Miles more, and
at length to the dry Land, to their great Sa∣tisfaction,
tho' it was then quite Night.</P>
<P>Their Comrades had been near an Hour in
the Dark, that is to say, with only a dusky
Light, and began to be greatly at a Loss, not
being able to see the Compass, they had made
shift to get over the Half-Mile of deeper
Water pretty well, for tho' it was too deep
for the Men to wade, as above, yet they could
reach the Bottom with their Poles, and at that
Time they happened to feel a little Breeze of
Wind fair in their Way, which both refreshed
them with its cool Breath, and also gave them
a Kind of a Jog on their Way towards the
Shore.</P>
<P>At Length, to their great Joy, they saw a
Light; and it was the more to their Joy, be∣cause
they saw it just before them, or, as the
Seamen call it, Right a Head; by which they
had the Satisfaction to know they had not
varied their Course in the Dark. It seems
<PB N="175" REF="388"/>
their Two Men had landed upon a fair rising
Ground, where they found some low Bushes
and Trees, and where they had good hard
dry Standings; and they soon found Means to
pick out a few withered dry Sticks, with
which they made a Blaze for the present,
having struck Fire with the Tools they were
furnished with, as above.</P>
<P>By the Light of this Blaze, they gave the
first Notice to their Comrades, as above, that
they were landed, and they again, as was
agreed before Hand, fired Two Guns as a
Signal that they saw it, and were all safe;
also, by the Light of this Fire, they gave
themselves so much Light as to find more dry
Wood; and afterwards their Fire was so
strong and good, that they made the green
Wood burn as well as the dry.</P>
<P>Their Companions were now come into the
shoal Water, in which, as I said, the Men
waded, but as their Floats did not draw above
a Foot or Eighteen Inches Water at most,
they went on still; but at length, being
within about Half a Mile of the Hillock,
where the Two Men were, they found the
Water so shallow, that their Floats would not
swim. Upon this, more of the Men went
over-board with Poles in their Hands, sound∣ing,
as we may call it, for deeper Water;
and, with long Puddling about, they found
the Ground fall off a little in One Place, by
which they got their Floats about a Quarter
of a Mile farther: But then the Water was
shallow again not above a Foot Water. So,
in a Word, they were fain to be content, and
<PB N="176" REF="389"/>
running fast a-Ground, they immediately
began, tho' dark, and themselves very much
fatigued, to unload their Ships; and carry
all on Shore on their Backs.</P>
<P>The first Thing they took Care to land,
was their Ammunition, their Gun-powder and
Arms; not forgetting the <HI>Ammunition de
Bouche,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> call it, I mean their
Victuals; and, with great Joy, they got to
their Two Comrades; then they fetched their
proper Materials for their Tent, and set it up,
and having refreshed themselves, they went
all to sleep (as they said) without so much
as a Centinel placed for their Guard: For as
they saw no Inhabitants, so they feared no
Enemies; and, it may be supposed they were
weary enough to make them want Rest, even
in the extreamest Manner.</P>
<P>In the Morning they had Time enough to
reflect upon the Madness of such rash Adven∣tures,
as you shall hear: Their Floats, indeed,
remained as they had left them, and the Wa∣ter
was ebbed away from them above Two
Miles, that is to say, almost to the deep Half-Mile,
mentioned above, but they heard a
surprizing Noise and Roaring of the Water
on the Lake itself, the Body of which was
now above Seven Miles from them.</P>
<P>They could not imagine what this Roar∣ing
should mean, for they felt no Wind, nor
could they perceive any Clouds at a Di∣stance
that looked as if they brought any
Squawls of Wind with them, as they are of∣ten
observed to do: But when they came
nearer the Water, they sound it had a Kind
<PB N="177" REF="390"/>
of a Swell, and that there was certainly some
more violent Motion at the farther Distance;
and in a little while, looking behind them to∣wards
the Shore where their Comrades were,
they found the Water began to spread over
the flat Ground again, upon which, they
hasten'd back, but having a good Way to go,
they were obliged to go Knee-deep, before
they reached to the Hillock where their Tent
stood.</P>
<P>They had not been many Hours on Shore,
before they found the Wind began to rise, and
the Roaring, which before they heard at a
Distance, grew louder and nearer, till at
length the Floats were lifted up, and driven
on Shore, by the Wind, which increased to a
Storm; and the Water swelled and grew rough,
and, as they were upon the Lee Shore, the
Floats were soon broken in Pieces, and went
some one Way and some another.</P>
<P>In the Evening, it overcast and grew cloudy,
and about Midnight they had their Share of
a violent Rain, which yet, they could see,
was more violent towards the Mountains of
the <HI>Andes,</HI> and towards the Course of the
River, which they came down in the Floats.</P>
<P>The Consequence of this, was naturally,
that, the Third Day, the Waters of the Lake
swelled again to a frightful Height, that is to
say, it would have been frightful to them, if
they had been upon it, for they suppose it
rose about Two Fathom perpendicular, and
the Wind continuing fresh, the Water was all
a white Foam of Froth; so, that had they had a
<PB N="178" REF="391"/>
good large Boat under them, she would scarce
have lived there.</P>
<P>Their Tent kept them dry, and as they
were on dry Land, and too high to be reached
by any Inundation, they had no Concern up∣on
them about their Safety: But, to be sure,
took this for sufficient Notice, not to come
up the Lake again in Haste, unless they were
better provided with Boats to ride out a
Storm.</P>
<P>Our Men began now to think they had
taken their Leave of the Golden Lake, and
yet they knew not how to think of leaving
it so soon: They were now Fourteen or Fif∣teen
Leagues off of that fine Golden Shore
where they took up so much, nor did they
know the Way to it by Land, and as for go∣ing
by Water, that they were unprovided for,
several Ways; besides, the Waters kept up to
a considerable Height, and the Winds blew
fresh for Six or Eight Days together.</P>
<P>All these Obstrctuions joyn'd together,
put them upon considering of persuing their
March by Land; in which, however, they
resolved to coast the Lake as near as they
could to the Eastward, till, if possible, they
should find that the Waters had some Outlet,
that is to say, that the Lake emptied itself
by some River towards the Sea, as they con∣cluded
it certainly must.</P>
<P>They had not yet seen any Inhabitants, or
any Sign of them, at least, not near them;
they did, or 'tis thought they fancied they
did, see some on the other Side of the River,
but they would not come within Reach of
<PB N="179" REF="392"/>
them on any Account, so that 'tis doubtful
whether they really saw them or no.</P>
<P>Before they decamped for a March, it was
needful to get some Provisions, if possible,
and this made them the more desirous of
finding out some conversible Creatures, but it
was in vain: They killed a wild Cow and a
Deer, and this was all they could get for some
Time; and with this they set forward, taking
their Course East, and rather Northerly, in or∣der
to come into the same Latitude they set out
in, at their first embarking on the River.</P>
<P>After they had marched thus for about Three
Days, keeping the Lake on the North Side of
them, and always in View, at length, on the
third Day in the Evening, coming to a little
Hill, which gave them the Prospect of the
Country for some Length <HI>N. E.</HI> they saw
plainly a River issuing out of the Lake, and
running first East, then bending to the South,
it was also easy to perceive, that this River
was at that Time much broader than in its
usual Course, for that they could see a great
many Trees, which probably grew on the
Bank of the River, standing, as it were, in
the Middle of the Water, the Banks being
overflowed both Ways very considerably.</P>
<P>But as they mounted the Hill, which they
stood on, to a greater Height, they discover'd
farther North, at the Distance of Five or Six
Miles, according to their Account, a much larg∣er
River, which looked, compared to the first
River, rather like a Sea than a River, which
likewise issued out of the Lake and run <HI>E.</HI>
by <HI>S.</HI> towards the Sea; which River they sup∣posed
<PB N="180" REF="393"/>
to be in the same Manner swelled with
a Land-Water, or Fresh, as the Lake was, to a
prodigious Degree.</P>
<P>This Prospect brought them to a more se∣rious
Consultation, as to the Measures they
should take to proceed on their Journey; and,
as they could easily see, there was little or no
Use to be made of the Rivers for their Tra∣velling,
while the Water was thus above the
ordinary Banks, so that they could not know
the proper Channels, and also that the Currents
were exceeding swift; so they resolved to
stock themselves with Provisions, if possible,
and continue their Journey by Land.</P>
<P>To this Purpose, they first made it their
Business to catch some more <HI>Guinacos,</HI>
or large Sheep, which they knew, would not
only feed them, but also carry their Luggage,
which was still heavy and very troublesome
to them, and yet absolutely necessary too:
But all their Endeavour was in vain, for tho'
they saw several, and found that the Country
was pretty full of them, and some they kil∣led,
yet they could not take One alive,
(which was the Thing they chiefly wanted)
by any Means that they could contrive.</P>
<P>Among the rest of the Creatures they shot
for Food, they very often found wild Cows
and Bulls, and especially, as they found af∣terwards,
on the North Side of the River;
but the most surprizing Thing to them that
they had yet met with, was still to come:
They had descended from the Hill,
where they at first discover'd the smaller
River, and where they had set up their Tent,
<PB N="181" REF="394"/>
resolving to march on the lower Grounds, as
near the River as they could, so as to be out
of Danger of the Water, that they might find,
if possible, some Way over to come at the
great River, which they judg'd to be the
Stream most proper for their Business.</P>
<P>Here they found a rich pleasant Country,
level and fruitful, not so low as to be exposed
to the overflowing of the River; and not so
high as to be dry and barren; several little
Brooks and Streams of Water, rising on the
Side of the Hill they came from, ran wind∣ing
this Way and that, as if to find out the
River, and near the River were some Woods of
very large Trees.</P>
<P>The Men, not forgetting the main Chance,
fell to washing and searching the Sand and
Gravel in these Brooks for Gold; but the
Harvest of Gold seemed to be over, for here
they found none. They had also an Occasion
to discover, that till the Land-Waters were
abated, there was no stirring for them, no, not
so much as to cross the first River, nor, if
they did, could they find in their Hearts to
venture, not knowing, but the Waters might
still rise higher, and that the Two Rivers
might swell into One, and so they should be
swallowed up, or if not, they might be sur∣rounded
in some island, where they should
perish for want of Provisions; so they re∣solved
to fetch their Baggage from the Hill, as
well as they could, and encamp in those plea∣sant
Plains, as near the River as they could,
till the Water should abate.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="395"/>
While they stay'd here, they were so far
from having Hopes that the Waters would
abate, that it rained violently for almost Three
Days and Nights together; and one of those
rainy Mornings, looking out at their Tent-Door,
(for they could not stir abroad for the
Rain) they were surprized, when looking to∣wards
the River, which was just below them,
they saw a prodigious Number of black Crea∣tures
in the Water, and swimming towards
the Shore where their were.</P>
<P>They first imagined they were Porpusses,
but could not suggest any Thing of that Kind
at such a Distance from the Sea, when one of
the Men, looking at them through a Glass,
cried out, they were all black Cattle, and
that he could perceive their Horns and their
Heads; upon this, others looking with their
Glasses also, said the same, immediately, eve∣ry
Man run to his Gun, and, notwithstanding
it rained hard, away they march'd down to
the River's Side with all the Speed they could
make.</P>
<P>By that Time they reach'd the River-Bank,
their Wonder incrased, for they found it was
a vast Multitude of black Cattle, who find∣ing
the Waters rise between the Two Rivers,
and, by a natural Sagacity, apprehensive of
being swept away with the Flood, had, One
and All, took the Waters, and were swimming
over to this Side for Safety.</P>
<P>You may very well suppose, the Fellows,
tho' they wanted a few such Guests these,
yet were terrified with their Multitude, and
began to consider what Course to take when
<PB N="183" REF="396"/>
the Creatures should come to land, for there
was a monstrous many of them: Upon the
whole, after a short Consultation, for the
Creatures came on apace, they resolved to get
into a low Ground, where, they perceived,
they directed their Course, and, in which,
there were a great many Trees, and that they
would all get up into the Trees, and so lie
ready to shoot among them as they land∣ed.</P>
<P>Accordingly they did so, except that Five of
them, cutting down some large Boughs of a
Tree, got into a little Thicket close to the Wa∣ter,
which they so fortified with the Boughs of
the Trees, that they thought themselves se∣cure
within, and there they posted themselves,
resolving to expect them and take their Ha∣zard.</P>
<P>When the Creatures came to land, it was wonderful to observe, how they lowed and
roared, as it were, to bid one another wel∣come
on Shore, and spreading themselves up∣on
the neighbouring Plain, immediately lay
down, and rowling and stretching themselves,
gave our People Notice, that, in short, they
had swam a great Way, and were very much
tired.</P>
<P>Our Fellows, you may suppose, laid about
them, and the Five Men that fixed them∣selves
in the Thicket, had the fairest Oppor∣tunity,
for they killed Eleven or Twelve of
them as soon as they set their Foot on Shore,
and lamed as many.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="397"/>
And now they had a Tryal of Skill, for as
they kill'd as many as they knew what to do
with, and had their Choice of Beef, if they
kill'd a Bull, they let him lie, as having no
Use for him, but chose the Cows, as what
they thought was only fit for Eating.</P>
<P>But, I say, now they had a Tryal of Skill,
namely, to see if they could maim some of
them, so as not to kill them, and might bring
them to carry their Luggage: This was a Kind
of a fruitless Attempt, as we afterwards told
them, to make a Baggage-Horse of a wild
Bull.</P>
<P>However, they brought it so far to pass,
that having wounded several young Bulls ve∣ry
much, after they had run roaring about
with the Hurt, they lay down and bled so,
as, that it was likely, they would bleed to
Death, as several of them really did; but the
Surgeon observing Two of them to be low e∣nough
that he might go to them, and do what
he would with them, he soon stopped the
Bleeding, and, in a Word, healed the Wounds;
all the while he was doing this, he caused
Food, that is to say, Grass and Boughs of
Trees to be brought to them for Food, and in
Four or Five Days, the Creatures were very
well: Then he caused them to be hamper'd
with Ropes and tied together, so that they
could neither sight with their Heads or run
away with their Heels; and having thus
brought them to a Place just by their Tent,
he caused them to be kept so hungry, and al∣most
stcrved, that when Meat was carried
them, they were so tame and thankful, that,
<PB N="185" REF="398"/>
at last, they would eat oat of his Hand, an
stretch out their Heads for it, and when they
were let a little looser, would follow him a∣bout
for a Handful of Grass, like a Dog for
a Bone.</P>
<P>When he had brought them thus to Hand,
he, by Degrees, loaded them, and, taught
them to carry, and if they were unruly
as they were at first, he would load them with
more than they could well carry, and make
them stand under that Load Two or Three
Hours, and then come himself and bring
them Meat, and take the Load off; and thus
in a few Days, they knew him so well, that
they would let him do any thing with them.</P>
<P>When they came to decamp, they tied them
both together, with such Ropes as they had,
and made them carry a very great Weight.
They tried the same Experiment with Two
more, but they failed, one died, and the
other prov'd untractable, sullen and outragi∣ous.</P>
<P>They had now lain here Twelve Days,
having Plenty of Provision, in which Time the
Weather proving fair, the Land-Waters run off
and the Rivers came to their old Channels,
clear and calm: The Men would gladly have
gone back to the Sands and flat Shore of the
Lake, or to some other Part to look for Gold;
but that was impracticable now, so they
march'd on, and in about Two Days, they found
the first River seemed to turn so much to the
<HI>South,</HI> that they thought it would carry them
too far out of their Way, for their Orders
were to keep about the Latitude of Forty to
<PB N="186" REF="399"/>
Fifty Degrees, as is said before, so they resolved
to get over the first River as soon as they could;
they had not gone far, but they found the
River so shallow, that they easily forded it,
Bulls and all, and being safely landed, they
travelled cross the Country directly to the
great River, which they found also very low,
tho' not like to be forded as the other was.</P>
<P>Now, they thought, they were in the Way
of their Business, and here they resolved to
see if a Tree or Two might be found, big
enough, to make a large Canoe to carry them
down this River, which, as it seemed large,
so the Current seemed to be less rapid and fu∣rous,
the Channel being deep and full.</P>
<P>They had not searched long, but they found
Three Trees, as they thought, large enough,
and they immediately went to work with
them, fell'd them, and shap'd them, and
in Four Days Time, they had Three hand∣some
Canoes; one larger then the rest, and
able to carry, in all, Fifteen or Sixteen Men;
but this was not enough, so they were forced
to look out farther for Two Trees more, and
this took them up more Time. However, in
about a Week they launched them all: As for
Days, they had lost their Account of Time;
so that as they had, sometimes, no Room to
distinguish one Day from another, so they,
after some Time, quite forgot the Days, and
knew not a Sunday from a Working-Day
any more.</P>
<P>While these Canoes were making, the Men,
according to the old Trade, fell to rummag∣ing
the Shores of this River, as they had
<PB N="187" REF="400"/>
done the other, for Gold, nor did they whol∣ly
lose their Labour, for in several Places
they found a pretty deal; and here it was,
that a certain Number of them, taking one
of the Canoes that were first made, took a
Voyage of their own Heads, not only with∣out
Command, but against Command; and
having inade a little Mast and Sail to it, went
up towards the Lake, resolving to go quite
into the Lake, to find another Golden Shore
or <HI>Gold Coast,</HI> as they call'd it.</P>
<P>To give a particular Account of this wild Un∣dertaking,
would be too long, nor would the
Rogues give much Account of it themselves;
only, in short, that they found a Sand pretty
rich in Gold, work'd upon it Five Days, inde∣fatigably,
and got a good deal, suffcient, had,
they brought it back, to have tempted the rest
to have gone all away to the same Place: But
at the End of Five Days, some were for return∣ing,
and others for staying longer, till the Majo∣rity
prevailed to come back, representing to the
rest, that their Friends would be gone, and
they should be left to starve in that wild
Country, and should never get home; so
they all got into the Canoe again, but quar∣relled
when they were in, and that, to
such an unreasonable Height, that, in short,
they fought, over-set the Boat, lost all their
Gold and their Arms, except three Muskets
which were lashed under the Thouts or
Benches of the Canoe, spoiled their Ammu∣nition
and Provision, and drowned one of
their Company, so they came home to the
<PB N="188" REF="401"/>
rest by weeping Cross, wet and almost fa∣mished.</P>
<P>This was a Balk to them, you may be sure,
and put a Damp to their new Projects; and
yet, Six of the same Men were so bold after∣wards,
as to demand to be dismis'd, and a Ca∣noe
given them, and they would go back,
they said, to the Golden Lake, where, they
did not doubt, they should load the Canoe
with Gold; and if they found, when they
came back, we were gone, they would find
their Way back thro' the Mountains, and go
to the rich <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who, they did not doubt,
would get them License to go back to <HI>Europe</HI>
with the Galleons, and, perhaps, they said,
they might be in <HI>England</HI> before us.</P>
<P>But the Captain quelled this Mutiny, tho'
there were Four or Five more come into it,
and shewing them the Agreement they had
made with me, their Commander; the Obli∣gation
they were under, and the Madness of
their other Proposal, prevailed with them to go
forward with the rest, and pursue the Voyage,
which he now represented to be very easy,
being, <HI>as it were,</HI> all the Way down Hill,
that is to say, with the Stream, for they all
knew the River they were in must go to the Sea,
and that, in or near, the Latitude which they
knew the Ship had appointed to wait for them.
However, to soften them a little, and, in
some Measure, to please them, he promised,
that, if they met with any Success in the
Search after Gold, in the River they were in,
as he did not question but they should, he
would consent to any reasonable Stop that
<PB N="189" REF="402"/>
they should propose, not exceeding Five Days
in a Place, and the Places to be not less than
Five Leagues off from one another.</P>
<P>Upon these Terms they consented, and all
embarked and came away, tho' extreamly
mortified for the loss of one of their Compa∣nions,
who was a brave stout Fellow, very
well beloved by all the Company, but there
was no Remedy; so they came on in Five
Canoes, and with a good Stock of Provisions,
such as it was, (<HI>viz.</HI>) good fresh Beef cured in
the Sun, and Fifteen <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep alive,
for when they got into the Country, between
the Two Rivers, they found it easy to catch
those Creatures, who, before that, would not
come near them.</P>
<P>And now they came down the River apace,
till they came to another Golden Shore, where,
finding some Quantity of Gold, they claim'd
their Captain's Promise, and accordingly,
they went all on Shore to work, and pretty
good Success they had, picking up, from a∣mong
the Sands, a considerable Quantity of
Gold; and having stay'd Four of the Five
Days, they found they had cleared the Place,
which was not of a long Extent, and so they
chearfully came on.</P>
<P>They came on now for Eleven Days toge∣ther
very willingly, but then found the Chan∣nel
of the River divided itself, and one went
away to the left, and the other to the right;
they could not judge which was the best to
take; but not questioning, but that they
would meet again soon, they took the South∣most
Channel, as being most direct in their
<PB N="190" REF="403"/>
Latitude; and thus they proceeded for Three
or Four Days more, when they were oblig'd
to put into the Mouth of a little River, that
fell into the other, and made a good Harbour
for their little Fleet.</P>
<P>Here, I say, they were obliged to put in
for want of Provisions, for they had eat up
all their <HI>Guinacoes,</HI> and their Two tame
Bulls too, the last of which, they soon repent∣ed,
as you will see presently.</P>
<P>After they had been a Hunting, and shot
a couple of Deer and a Cow, with a Kind of
a Hare, as big as an <HI>English</HI> Fox, they set for∣ward
again very merry, and the more, because
they had another little Piece of a Gold Coast,
where, for Two Days, they had very good
Luck again; but judge how they were sur∣prized,
and in what a Consternation they
were, when coming down farther the same
River, they heard a terrible Noise in the Ri∣ver,
as of a mighty Cataract, or Water-fall,
which increased as they came forward, till it
grew so loud, that they could not hear them∣selves
speak, much less hear one another.</P>
<P>As they approached, it was the more fright∣ful;
so at length, lest they should be hurried
into it before they were aware, they went all
on Shore, doing all by Signs and dumb Po∣stures,
for it was impossible to hear any
Sound.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, it was near Six Miles
to the Place, which, when they perceived,
some of them went back to bring on the
Boats, and so brought them as near the Place
as they durst, and run them on Shore into a
<PB N="191" REF="404"/>
little hollow Part of the Bank, just big enough
to hold them: When they had thus secured the
Boats, they went to view the Water-fall;
but, how was they astonished? when they
found, that there were not One, but Five Wa∣falls,
at the Distance of about Two Miles
from one another, some more, some less, that
the Water fell a prodigious Height; so that
it was impossible any Boat could bear to
launch down the Cataract and not be dashed
in Pieces.</P>
<P>They now saw there was ho Remedy, but
that they must lose the Benefit of their Five
Canoes, which had been so comfortable to
them, and by which, they had come above
Four Hundred Miles in a little Time, with
Safety and Pleasure.</P>
<P>These Cataracts made the River perfectly
useless to them for above Twenty Miles, and
it was impossible to drag their Canoes that
Length over Land, so in short, they unload∣ed
them, and for their own Satisfaction, they
turned one, the biggest, of them a-drift, and
let it go to the first Cataract, placing them∣selves
so beyond, that they might see it come
down, which they did, and had the Pleasure
of seeing it dashed in Pieces on the Rocks
below.</P>
<P>Well, there was no Remedy, but they must
leave their Boats behind them; and now, as
I have said, they had Time to repent killing
their Two tame Bulls, who would have done
them good Service; but it was too late to
look back upon what was done and over, so
many Days before; they had now no Reme∣dy,
<PB N="192" REF="405"/>
if they would go forward, but to take
up their Baggage upon their Shoulders, and
walk on Foot; the only Help they had, was,
that they had gotten Five <HI>Guinacoes</HI> more,
which, tho' they were hungry, and would fain
have eaten, yet, as they carried, at least, Five
Hundred Weight of their Luggage, they chose
to fast and walk, rather than feast and work;
so they went on as well as they could, till they
got past these Falls, which, tho' not above
Twenty Miles, cost them Five Days La∣bour.</P>
<P>Then they encamped again to refresh, them∣selves,
and consider of what was next to be
done: They were thus long upon this short
Journey for many Reasons.</P>
<P>1. Because they were obliged to employ the
best Part of Two Days in Hunting for their
Food, in which Time, Five of them swim∣ing
over the River to shoot at some black
Cattle, extreamly fatigued themselves in pur∣suing
them, but did, however, shoot Five
Cows and Bulls; but then it was at such a
Distance, that it was more Pains to drag the
Flesh along to the River's Side, than it was
worth to have it, only, that they were, in∣deed
hunger-starved, and must have it.</P>
<P>2. They found still some little Quantity of
Gold in the Water, that is to say, below the
Falls, where the Water, after, by falling with
such Force, it had made a Pit or Hole of a
vast Depth, as is usual at a Mill-Tail, had
thrown up a Shoal again, at, perhaps, a Mile
Distance, there they took up some Gold,
<PB N="193" REF="406"/>
whenever the Water was low enough to come
to the Shoal.</P>
<P>3. The Weight of their Baggage made
them travel heavy, and seldom above Five
or Six Miles a Day.</P>
<P>Being now come to the open River, they
thought of building more Floats, but they
were discouraged from this Consideration;
That they did not know, but in few Days
March, there might be more Water-falls, and
then all their Labour would be lost; so they
took up their Tent, and began to travel
again.</P>
<P>But here, as they kept the River close on
Board, as the Seamen call it, they were at a
full Stop, by the coming in of another River
from the <HI>S. W.</HI> which, when it joined, the Ri∣ver
they went along by, was above a Quarter of
a Mile broad, and how to get over it they knew
not; they sent Two Men up the additional
River some Length, and he brought Word,
that it was, indeed, narrower by much, but
no where fordable, but deep and rapid.</P>
<P>At the same Time, they sent Two more
nimble Fellows down the Coast of the great
River, to see if there were no more Water∣falls,
who brought them Word, there were
none for Sixty Miles.</P>
<P>While they lay here, at the Point of the
Influx, expecting the Return of their Scouts,
they used what Diligence they could in get∣ting
Provisions; and among the rest, they
killed Three Cows and a Bull on the other Side
of the biggest River; but not knowing how to
bring them over, they concluded to go over, as
<PB N="194" REF="407"/>
many as could swim, which was the better
Half of them, and sit down by it, and roast
and broil upon the Spot, as much as they could
eat, and then bring over as much as they
could for their Fellows.</P>
<P>They got Boughs of Trees, and bound
them together, then wrapt the Meat in the
Hides, and laid it on the Wood, and made
a Hundred little Contrivances to get it over;
so that on one Side or other, they got all the
Meat eaten or brought over: what they got on
their own Side the River, they made better
shift with.</P>
<P>On the Return of their Scouts, they found
there was no Remedy, but to build some new
Vessels of one Kind or another, to take in
Their Baggage and Provision which they did,
after the Manner of their first Floats; for
they found no Trees big enough to make Ca∣noes;
when therefore, they had made one
great Float, they resolved to make Two small
Boats like Yauls or Skiffs, with which they
might tow their large Float or Barge; and as
this they might do with small Stuff, so they
found Means to line them within and without
with the Bulls Hides, and that, so dextrous∣ly
joined, and lapped or rolled one over ano∣ther,
that no Water came thro', or but very
little.</P>
<P>With these Two Boats, they ferried over
the small Rivers with Ease, each Boat carry∣ing
Six Men, besides Two to row; and when
they were over the small Rivers, the Two
Boats served to tow their great Punt or Barge
close by the Shore.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="408"/>
The greatest Difficulty was for Tow-Lines
to draw the Boats by, and that they suppli∣ed,
by twisting a strong tough Kind of Flag
or Rush, which they found in the River, of
which, with great Application, they made a
Kind of Rope-yarn, and then twisting it
again, made it very strong.</P>
<P>This was the Voiture with which they car∣ried
themselves down quite to the Sea, and
one of these Boats it was, that we spyed, <HI>as
above,</HI> coming to us in the Bay.</P>
<P>They had yet above Four Hundred and
Fifty Miles to the Sea, nor could they at any
Time tell or guess how far off it might be. They
went on more or less every Day, but 'twas
but slowly, and not without great Labour,
both of Rowing and Towing: Their Provi∣sions
also cost them much Labour, and it was
a great deal of Difficulty, that they were
obliged, first to hunt and kill it, and then to
bring it to the Camp, which was always close
to the River's Side.</P>
<P>After they had travelled thus some Time,
following the Course of the River, behold
they came to a Place, where, of a sudden,
they could see no farther Bank of the River,
but it looked all Water like the Sea; they
could not imagine what it must be, so, the
next Day, they rowed towards it with one of
their little Boats, when they were surprized,
to find that it was the Northern Branch of the
River, which they had seen go off before they
came at the Water-falls, which River being
now increased with many other great Waters,
was now so great, that the Mouth of it might
<PB N="196" REF="409"/>
be said to be, Four or Five Miles over, and
rather received this River, which they were
on, into it, than ran into this; but after this,
it contracted itself again, tho' still it was to
be supposed near a Mile and Half over.</P>
<P>They were not glad of this Conjunction of
the Waters at all, because the great Water be∣ing
thus joined, they found the Stream, or Cur∣rent,
more violent, and the Water, upon the
least Stirring of the Wind, much more turbu∣lent
than it was before; and, as their great
Float drew but little Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, and swa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> flat
upon the Surface, she was ready to founder
upon every Occasion: This obliged them,
almost every Night, to seek for some little
Cove or Creek to run her into, as into a Har∣bour
to preserve her; for it the Wind blew
off Shore, they had enough to do to keep her
from driving off, if it blew off from the
River, tho' it were, otherwise, little Wind
enough, yet it made a Rippling or Chopping of
the Waves, that they had much Difficulty to
keep it from filling her.</P>
<P>All the Country, on the Side of this River,
was a little higher Ground than ordinary,
which was its Security from Land-Floods,
and their Security too, for sometimes the Ri∣ver
was seen to rise, and that so as to over∣slow
a great Extent of Land on the other Side.
Hence, perhaps, the other Side might be
esteemed the most fruitful, and, perhaps,
might be the better Land, if it had but Half
of the Art and Industry of an <HI>European</HI> Nation
to assist: the natural Fertility of the Soil,
by keeping the Water in its Bounds, banking and
<PB N="197" REF="410"/>
fencing the Meadows from the Inundations,
and Freshes, which were frequently sent
down from the <HI>Andes,</HI> and from the Country
adjoining.</P>
<P>But as it now was, those Lower Lands lay,
great Part of the Year, under Water; whe∣ther
it was the better or the worse for the Soil,
that no Judgment can be made of, till some
People come to settle there, to whom it shall
be worth while to make Experiments of that
Kind.</P>
<P>This Part of the Country, they were now
in, resembled, as they hinted, the County
of <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> and the Downs about <HI>Salisbury,</HI>
only, not lying so high from the Surface of
the Water, and the Soil being a good fruit∣ful
dark Mould, not a chalky solid Rock, as
in the County about <HI>Salisbury,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here they found a greater Quantity of
Deer than they had seen in all their Journey,
which they often had the good Luck to kill
for their Supply of Food, the Creatures not
being so shy and wild, as they had found
farther within the Country.</P>
<P>It may be noted here, and 'tis very obser∣vable,
that in all this Journey, I do not learn,
that they saw either Wolf or Fox, Bear or
Lyon, or, indeed, any other ravenous Crea∣ture,
which they had the least Reason to be
shy or afraid of, or which, indeed, were
frightful to the Deer; and this, perhaps, may
be the Reason, why the Number of those
Creatures is so great, which, as I have said, is
greater there than at other Places.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="411"/>
After they had feasted themselves here, as
above, for some Days, they resolved to begin
their New Kind of Navigation, and see what
they could make of it; but they went very
heavily along, and every now and then, <HI>as I have
said above,</HI> the Water was too rough for them,
and they were fain to put into Harbour, and
sometimes lie Two or Three Days: How∣ever,
they plyed their Time as well as they
could, and sometimes the Current setting over
to their Side, and running strong by the Shore,
they would go at a great Rate, insomuch,
that one Time, they said, they went above
Thirty Miles in a Day, having, besides the
Current, a little Gale of Wind right a
Stern</P>
<P>They reckoned, that they went near Two
Hundred Miles in this Manner, for they
made the best of it; and at the End of this
Two Hundred Miles, it was, by their Reck∣oning,
that our Five Men, who travelled into
the Country so far, found them, when they
saw the Hat swimming down the Stream;
which Hat, it seems, one of them let fall over∣board
in the Night.</P>
<P>They had, I say, travelled thus far with
great Difficulty, the River being so large;
But, as they observed it growing larger and
larger, the farther they went, so, they said, they
did not doubt, but that, in a little more,
they should come to the Sea.</P>
<P>They also observed, that now, as they
found the Waters larger, and the Rivers wi∣der,
they killed more Fowls than formerly,
and particularly, more of the Duck-foot
<PB N="199" REF="412"/>
Kind, tho' they could not perceive any Sea-Fowls,
or such as they had been used to. They
saw a great many wild Swans, and some
Geese, as also Duck, and Mallard, and
Teal; and these, I say, increased as they
drew nearer the Sea.</P>
<P>They could give very little Account of the
Fish which the Rivers produced, tho' they
sometimes catched a few in the smaller Ri∣ver;
but, as they had neither Fishing-hook
or Nets, which was the only Omission, in my
fitting them out, they had no Opportunity
to furnish themselves.</P>
<P>They had, likewise, no Salt, neither was
it possible to furnish them with Salt, so they
cured their Meat in the Sun, and seasoned
it with that excellent Sauce called Hun∣ger.</P>
<P>The Account they gave, of discovering
our Five Men, was thus, in short; They had
been for Two Days, pretty successful in their
Navigation, as I have described it; but were
obliged to stop, and put in at the Mouth of
a little River, which made them a good Har∣bour;
the Reason of their Stay was, they
had no Victuals, so by consent, they all went
a hunting, and at Night, having shot Two
<HI>Guinacoes</HI> and a Deer, they came to Sup∣per
together in their great Tent; and having
fed heartily, you may suppose, on such good
Provisions, they began to be merry, and the
Captain and Officers, having a little Store
left, tho' not much, they pulled out their
Bottles, and drank every one a Dra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to their
<PB N="200" REF="413"/>
good Voyage, and to the merry Meeting of
their Ships, and gave every Man a Sup.</P>
<P>But their Mirth was increased beyond ex∣pressing,
when Two of the Men, who were
without the Tent-Door, cried out, it light∣ened;
one said, he saw the Flash, he was
sure, and the other said, he thought he saw it
too; but, as it happened, their Backs were
towards the <HI>E.</HI> so that they did not see the
Occasion.</P>
<P>This Lightning was certainly the first
Flash of one of our Five Mens Rockets, or
the Breaking of it, and the Stars that were at
the End of it, up in the Air.</P>
<P>When the Captain heard the Men say it
light<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned, he jumped off of his Seat, and
called aloud to them, to tell which Way; but
they foolishly replied, to the <HI>N. W.</HI> which
was the Way their Faces were, when they
saw it, but the Word was no sooner spoken,
but the Two Fellows, fell a Hollowing and
Roaring, as if they were distracted, and said,
they saw a Rocket rise up in the Air to the
<HI>Eastward.</HI></P>
<P>So nimble were the Men, at this Word, that
they were all out of the Tent in a Moment,
and saw the last Bounce or Flash of the Roc∣ket
with the Stars, which spreading themselves
in the Air, shone with the usual bright Light,
that 'tis known those Things give.</P>
<P>This made them all set up a Shout of Joy,
as if they imagined their Fellows, who were
yet many Miles from them, should hear them;
but the Captain and Officers, who knew what
they were to do on this Occasion, ran to their
<PB N="201" REF="414"/>
Baggage, and took out their own Rockets and
other Materials, and prepared to answer the
Signal.</P>
<P>They were on a low Ground, but at less
than a Mile's Distance, the Land went ascend∣ing
up to a round Crown or Knowl pretty high;
away they ran thither, and let up a Frame in
an instant: But, as they were making these
Preparations, behold, to confirm their News,
they saw a Third Rocket rise up in the Air,
in the same Place as before.</P>
<P>It was near an Hour from the first Flash,
as they called it, before they could get all
Things ready; but then they fired Two
Rockets from the adjoining Hill, soon after
one another, and after that, at about Ten
Minutes Distance of Time, a third, which
was just as by Agreement, and was perfectly
understood, the Rockets performing very
well.</P>
<P>Upon this, they saw another single Rocket
rise up, which was to let them know, that
their former was seen and understood.</P>
<P>This was, you will conclude, a very joy∣ful
Night; and the next Morning, they went
all Hands to work at the Boats, getting out
of the Creek early, and made the best of
their Way; however, with all they could do,
they could not go above Twelve Miles that
Day, for, the Current setting over to the
other Shore, had left them, and in some
Places, they would rather have an eddy
Stream against them; and this discouraged
them a little, but depending that they were
near their Port, and that their Friends were
<PB N="202" REF="415"/>
not far off, they were very chearful. At
Night they looked out again for Rockets,
which failed not to rejoyce their Hearts
again; and, with this Addition, that it ap∣peared,
their Friends were not above Four
or Five Miles off; they answered the Rock∣ets
punctually, and proceeding early the next
Day, they met in the Morning, joyfully
enough, as has been said.</P>
<P>We were overjoyed at meeting, you may be
sure; but to see the pitiful Boat, or <HI>Periagua,</HI>
they came on Board in, a little surprized us,
for, indeed, it was a Wonder they should be
able to make it swim under them, especially
when they came out into the open Sea.</P>
<P>As soon as we had the Boat on Board, we
hal'd it up into the Ship for a Relick, and
taking Two of the Men with us, we Mann'd
out all our Ships Boats to go and fetch the
rest, for they were, as these Men told us,
about Seventeen Miles up the River still, and
could not come any farther, their Boats be∣ing
not able to bring them along, and the
River growing very broad and dangerous.
The Eldest of my Midshipmen came in this
First Boat, but the Captain and the other
staid with the Men, who were very unruly,
and ever and anon quarrelling and wrangling
about their Wealth, which, indeed, was very
considerable, but they were above twice as
far up the River as the Men told us, having
halted after the Boat left them.</P>
<P>When our Boats came to them, and took
them in, I ordered they should be set on
Shore, and their Tents put up on the Shore,
<PB N="203" REF="416"/>
'till I had settled Matters a little with them,
having had an Account how Mutinous and
Fractious they had been; and I made them
all stay there 'till I had fully adjusted every
thing with them about their Treasure, which,
indeed, was so much, that they scarce knew
how to govern themselves under the Thought
of it.</P>
<P>Here I proposed Conditions to them at
first, That all the Gold should be shared be∣fore
they went on Board, and that it should
be put on Board the Ship, as Goods for every
Man's single Account; that I would give them
Bills of Lading for it, and I offered to swear
to them, to deliver it into every Man's Posses∣sion,
separately, at the First Port we should
come to an Anchor at in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>France;</HI>
and that, at that said Port, they should every
Man have the One hundred Pounds I had
promised them, as above, for the undertak∣ing
this Journey, delivered to them in Mo∣ney,
that is to say, In <HI>Gold-Dust;</HI> and that
they alone, should have full Liberty to go
on Shore with it, and go whither they would,
no Man whatever, but themselves, being al∣lowed
to set Foot on Shore in the same Place,
<HI>Distress excepted.</HI> This they insisted on, be∣cause
they had done some Things, which, if I
would, I might have pursued some of them, for
perhaps, to the Gallows; but that I promised
to forgive them, and to enquire no more af∣ter
it.</P>
<P>In a Word, There had been a Scuffle among
'em, in which one of their Canoes was overset,
<HI>as was said,</HI> and one of their Number drowned,
<PB N="204" REF="417"/>
at the same Time when they lost a great
Part of their Gold; and some were thought
to have done it maliciously too.</P>
<P>However, as I had no Occasion to trouble
them on that Score, not being upon the Spot
when it was done; so having made this
Capitulation with them, I performed it pun∣ctually,
and set them all on Shore, with their
Wealth, in the River of <HI>Garonne</HI> in <HI>France;</HI>
Their Gold, their One hundred Pounds Re∣ward
for their Journey; their Wages, and
their Share of Pearl, and other Advantages,
made them very rich; for their Cargo, when
cast up on Shore, might, perhaps, amount
to about Four hundred Pounds a Man: How
they disposed of themselves, or their Money,
I never gave myself the Trouble to enquire,
and, if I had, 'tis none of my Business to give
an Account of it here.</P>
<P>We dismissed also, near Fourscore more of
our Men, afterwards, in a little Creek, which
was at their own Request; for most of them
having been of the <HI>Madagascar</HI> Men, and, by
Consequence, Pyrates, they were willing to
be easy, and I was as willing to make them
so, and, therefore, cleared with as many of
them as desired it. But I return to our
Ship.</P>
<P>Having thus made a long Capitulation
with our Travellers, I took them all on Board,
and had Leisure enough to have a long Nar∣ration
from them of their Voyage, and from
which Account, I take the Liberty to recom∣mend
that Part of <HI>America,</HI> as the best, and
most advantageous Part of the whole Globe
<PB N="205" REF="418"/>
for an <HI>English</HI> Colony, the Climate, the Soil,
and, above all, the easy Communication with
the Mountains of <HI>Chili,</HI> recommending it be∣yond
any Place that I ever saw, or read of,
as I shall farther make appear by itself.</P>
<P>We had nothing now to do, but to make
the best of our Way for <HI>England,</HI> and setting
Sail from the Mouth of the River <HI>Camerones,</HI>
so the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it, the Eighteenth of
<HI>January</HI> in which, we had a more difficult
and unpleasant Voyage, than in any other
Part of our Way, chiefly because, being a
rich Ship, and not knowing how Affairs stood
in <HI>Europe,</HI> I kept to the Northward; as far as
the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> steering thence to
the Coast of <HI>Galitia,</HI> where we touch'd, as
above; after which, we went through the
Channel, and arrived safe in <HI>Dunkirk</HI> Road,
The Twelfth of <HI>April;</HI> and from thence gave
private Notice of our good Fortune to our Mer∣chants
and Owners; Two of whom came
over to us, and received at our Hands, such
a Treasure, as gave them Reason to be very
well satisfied with their Adventure: But, to
my great Grief, my particular Friend, the
Merchant, who put us upon all the Curiosity,
and all the Discovery you have heard of,
was dead before our Return, which, if it
had not happened, this New Scheme of a
Trade round the World, had, perhaps, ne∣ver
been made Publick, till it had been put
in Practice, by a Set of Merchants designed
to be concerned in it, from the <HI>New Austrian
Netherlands.</HI></P>
