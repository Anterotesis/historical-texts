<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE><HI>Written by JOHN TAYLOR, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> SPOKEN by MR. C. KEMBLE.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>FROM the Stagyrite fam'd, as a critic profound,</L>
<L>To the carpers who now in our island abound,</L>
<L>It has still been allow'd that to write a good play,</L>
<L>Is a task somewhat hard, whether solemn or gay.</L>
<L>Such indeed was the case when the world was but young,</L>
<L>And from Nature's rough hand bold originals sprung;</L>
<L>'Ere the polish of manners had levell'd each class,</L>
<L>And strong featur'd characters mark'd the whole mass.</L>
<L>Yet a dramatist then, from examples so rife,</L>
<L>Need but just look abroad and take copies from life.</L>
<L>But mankind, since those days, have been sketch'd o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>And the Stage can but give what it gave you before.</L>
<L>Nay, one mighty genius, with wonderful art</L>
<L>Pervaded our nature, and ransack'd the heart;</L>
<L>Hence the works from his hand are so vivid and true,</L>
<L>That Time can but merely retouch what he drew.</L>
<L>After such a description, if Shakspeare we name,</L>
<L>'Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but saying what time shall for ever proclaim.</L>
<L>And since then the Stage has exhausted our race,</L>
<L>And has shewn each degree thro' the marvellous space</L>
<L>'Twixt the sage and the fop, and the good and the base,</L>
<L>A dramatist now can but hold up his glass,</L>
<L>And simply exhibit the times as they pass;</L>
<L>Content to pick up, as he saunters along,</L>
<L>Some anomalous beings, that start from the throng;</L>
<L>And such, we presume, to bring forward to-night:</L>
<L>But our Bard aims at no individual in spite;</L>
<L>He draws from the species, and thinks he may say,</L>
<L>You may find of such beings a tribe every day.</L>
<PB REF="4"/>
<L>To prevent disappointment, but not to forestall,</L>
<L>To one little hint your attention we call;</L>
<L>For this 'tis but right we should tell of his plan—</L>
<L>You must fancy a female is really a man;</L>
<L>Not merely conceal'd in the manly array,</L>
<L>But a man, <HI>bona fide,</HI> throughout the whole play;</L>
<L>This we own, as it else might your feelings perplex,</L>
<L>Since she charms you so much in her own proper sex.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now of this dread—but this merciful court,</L>
<L>A Bard, full of terrors, once more begs support—</L>
<L>Ah! kindly adopt the new brat of his brain,</L>
<L>You have often endur'd him,—endure him again.</L>

<SPEAKER>SCATTER. <HI>[Writing.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>THREE times five is fifteen — fifteen and twenty two is forty—no—thirty and carry five— and — psha! — I can't nor I wo'n't endure it — a man of my fashion turn steward, clerk, ac∣comptant!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT. <HI>[Mending linen.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And a woman of my fashion turn housekeeper, dairy-maid, stocking-mender! — ah! I'm much obliged to you, Mr. Scatter, for reducing me to this humi∣liating situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I reduced you? — 'twas your own imprudence that ruined us — your love of play — your insatiable passion for cassino, hazard, faro — that drove us from London.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>How dare you say so, Sir, — when you know your fortune was never injured by my gaming?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was n't it? — why, did n't you lose thousands night after night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but did I pay them? — was n't I so careful of my husband's money, that I did n't pay even for the cards on which I lost it? — No, Sir — 'twas your extravagance that undid us — your buying horses, carriages, and houses. — Oh! if you had been oeconomical — if you had copied my example.!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! I did copy your example — I never paid for them: and if you talk of being oeconomical, what married couple ever lived cheaper than we have done? — The fact is, we never had a shilling: and though each married the other in hopes of making a fortune, you know, when we came to the church, we had n't cash enough to pay the parson's fees.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, Sir: and what signifies wrangling? — if you will but mind your ac∣counts, and adapt yourself to my uncle's pastoral plan of life — come — come — proceed, as we have begun — continue to make him believe we hate London, love retirement, and are a most fond, affectionate, domestic couple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that's hard work, Kitty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed! — and then to turn shepherdess, as he calls me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! to rise at five — dine at three — go to bed at ten — wake at four, and not sleep a wink for the infernal chirruping of the cocks and hens! and all for what? — for the chance of his fortune after his death! — I tell you what — if he don't die soon, I certainly shall.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay — nay — our hopes don't all depend on his death. — The bank — think of his bank in the neighbouring sea-port town — if we can wheedle him out of a share in that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible! — he designs it for his son — or else, that's the very thing — a bank, and I partner in it! — 'slife! how I would discount—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Discount!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay — my own notes — nobody's else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! well! — only hide your cloven foot a little longer — don't let him know we left London for debt: and my life on't, the bank and the estate will both be ours — his son has behaved ill abroad: and if he disinherits him —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are his heiress; and then, we'll once more revel in the joys of London — ah! how I do sigh for St. James's-street!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I for Bond-street!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I for hazard!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I for faro — oh, my dear dear husband!—you've set me on the rack; and, though there are no cards in the house, can't we invent some game? — stop — here's my uncle! we've another game to play now — remember we're a loving man and wife.</P>

<SPEAKER>WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor souls! — But have you left no friends you wish to see? — I dare say, now, Mr. Scatter was much sought after in London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sought after! yes — I was, Sir; but then it was by people I wished to get rid of — by rude — unpolished — sum total 82-4-6.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rude! — ah, there's modern man∣ners for you—that's the reason I hate London— never go near it, or see any body that comes from it — Ha! ha! — it's very droll — but I know so little of what's going forward in the metropolis, that you and my niece might have quarrelled all day, and gambled all night, and I been ne'er the wiser — you might indeed — ha! ha!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! — that's very good — I and my dear husband quarrel and game!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that I suppose such a thing; no! I believe you're a pattern of all that's correct and regular — but I've no correspondents — I see no company, and don't even take in a news∣paper. — Come — egad! now you're come down, I think, I must humour you there — I must take in a newspaper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do: I should like it of all things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So should I — I'm very fond of reading the law reports and the debates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you? — then curse me, if I wonder at your having the head-ache — I never read either, but it brings on a giddiness di∣rectly.</P>

<P>Yes, Sir— he is now at the park gate.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Since my last, your son has been ab∣sent from my house a fortnight; and after searching in vain for him all over Marseilles, I at last found him living at a small inn in the neighbouring forest, with an English girl, whom he had betrayed under a promise of marriage. — I soon separated them: but he secretly returned to the inn; and finding her gone, he has pursued her to England — this is ”his history—"</P>
</LETTER>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there — there — after the pains I have taken with him, to have him turn out the character I of all others detest — a man of intrigue — a man of fashion —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, this is nothing new — your son was always of a gallant disposition; and when he visited us in London, we were actually
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>obliged to lock up our ward Stella, to prevent his carrying her off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCATTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, Sir: and I should be sorry to prejudice you more against him; but had you seen the designing glances he threw at my wife —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! — would the scoundrel have marred your domestic happiness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm not apt to be jealous — far from it, Sir — if your son had taken my wife to a forest, I shou'dn't have felt one jealous pang — should I, my life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No — that you wou'd'nt, my soul; —but when a couple is so happy —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>It ought to be death to him that parts them! — Oh the reprobate! why, here's a pretty fellow to manage a bank —.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did you say, Sir?— manage your bank!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: —I meant to make him a part∣ner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my dear Sir, that will never do! — your interest will be exhausted in the purlieus of Covent Garden, and your principal in the Court of King's Bench, and Doctors' Commons: —however, don't judge too hastily, Sir — hear what he has to say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will: I'll go directly, and my niece shall accompany me — come: —Oh! Mr. Scatter, as you're my new steward, you know, I've a lit∣tle business for you to transact forty miles off:—Ah! I see you're angry, niece — I see you can't bear being separated two whole days from the darling object of your affection.</P>

<P>So — while my guardian and his wife are engaged in their new occupations of steward and housekeeper, I've stole forth to visit my dear Elinor.—I wonder what can induce a girl of her rank and fortune to live in this sequestered spot; but whenever I touch on the subject, I see it agitates her, and therefore I'll distress her no more: — ha!—somebody's coming — I'll enter the house, and, in partaking her society, enjoy the

<P>Dare to live alone! — 'gad! that's bold work; for though I'm very fond of myself, I can't stay a moment by myself —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELINOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir — because you have per∣haps committed actions you cannot bear to re∣flect on; and therefore you fly to dissipation — game, drink, and insult unprotected women, only to keep yourself from yourself.— Go on, Sir; and to loss of peace, add loss of heath, and at last, loss of sense and honour.</P>

<SPEAKER>SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loss of sense!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELINOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay: how oft is madness the result of vice? — I have myself committed errors never to be obliterated; but I sought not relief by heaping crime on crime— no —I have combated

<SPEAKER>Old WOODLAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY, zounds, Sir! you don't pretend to love the lady in the forest still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not love her, Sir! — Why did I leave Marseilles? — why travel night and day in the pursuit of her? — why, but to tell her, my uncle caused our separation, entreat her pardon, and never leave more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never leave her! — but for your uncle then, you would have married her? — you would have disgraced your family, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Disgraced my family! — what! by acting like a man of honour, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honour! there now! — he has got all the fashionable words — Look ye, Sir — ; if you had had less honour and more honesty, you would not have seduced the girl at all; — but come — I've all a father's weakness about me; and if you will but give up the pursuit, and marry a rich widow —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry another, Sir! —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, why not, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never! — She sacrificed every thing to me; and if so poor an offer as my hand,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are; and you'll break your old father's heart; — come now, Tom — do oblige me — do marry the widow, and forget —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you have ever been a fond indulgent parent, and it cuts me to the soul to disobey you; but if we meet again, not e'en for you, will I a second time desert a girl, whom love and gratitude for ever bind me to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Mighty well, Sir! — then with all this pure love, how came you to be seen walk∣ing arm in arm with Stella — now, not half an hour ago — near farmer Cole's house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>I met her there by accident—.</P>

<P>Sir, I beg your pardon, but —</P>

<P>Oh, if you're Miss Elinor's friend, I'm sure Sir Edward will be glad to see you — never was brother so fond of a sister; and he would have been be here three days ago, if the gout hadn't attacked him on the road.</P>

<P>One of the best living — he is, perhaps, somewhat hasty in his temper:—but he is young—</P>

<P>Young! — what! about thirty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thirty! — he's not sixteen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SPUNGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not sixteen!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: a ward in chancery, Sir — and what's very extraordinary, he now knows more of the world than any of his ancestors did at three times his age—why, 'tis but a month ago he fought a duel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SPUNGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A duel! — zounds! — I knew the breed of boys was pretty forward, but never heard of such a forced plant as this — a duel!— how was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall hear, Sir — an old schoolfellow of his — a Mr. Woodland, having been swindled and arrested by one of your stock∣jobbing gentry, my master paid the debt; and Mr. Woodland was no sooner gone abroad, than the stockjobber made more demands, which Sir Edward wouldn't pay — on this, words ensued — he ridiculed my master's youth — this he laughed at — but when the stockjobber called Mr. Woodland a scoundel, Sir Edward was so enraged, that he struck him, and a challenge was the consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SPUNGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! and did the boy fight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he? — ay: and the first shot lamed the stockjobber for life — hit him in the hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SPUNGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! made him a lame duck? — I'm glad of it: and if he'd often go and take a day's shooting at the Stock Exchange, it would be much for the health of the nation — but here he comes — here's the little hero.</P>

<SPEAKER>ELINOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are, indeed, much altered, bro∣ther, since I and my poor father went to Mont∣pelier — 'tis three years ago; and you were then a school boy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: I was a man then — I've been a man these five years; and when men at sixty affect to be boys, why shouldn't boys at fifteen affect to be men? — besides, is wisdom confined to age? — mayn't I have seen as much of the world in one year, as a pedant has in twenty? oh! when you know all, Elinor, you'll find I'm a match for any man living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELINOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think not I complain — you are kind beyond my wishes:—and if I thought we should never part—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Part? — never! — unless either of us marry — and as for me — marriage is much too young a trick for a man of my experience — but you had a long journey, Elinor, after my poor father's death; and now I think on't — how came you to travel incog? — why change your name to Campbell?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELINOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I thought obscurity my best protection; and whilst the name of Bloomly might lead to enquiry, I thought that of Camp∣bell — but we'll talk on't no more — I am hap∣py now: and unless you are lured from me, by the charms of fashionable life—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh — that's quite gone by— I saw the folly of that, many — many years ago — yes: I saw the folly of fashionable life soon after I left my nursery — so don't be afraid of that rival, Elinor.</P>

<PB N="31" REF="36"/>Sir Edward, you're right welcome, Sir Edward— always happy to take merit by the hand — on a first acquaintance, never saw a person I took such a fancy to—so elegant—so generous—and then your hitting the stock-jobber—oh! I'll stick to you through life.</P>

<P>Know the way! — bless you! — I'm quite at home at Woodland Grove — drank tea there yesterday — meant to dine there to-day — good fruit, but bad butter. — Come — I'll whip you along.—I say, though—you are young, and Dick Scatter and his wife are knowing hands— pigeon you at faro — cassino.</P>

<P>Oh — come along — you don't want my instructions, I see.</P>

<P>No—you may save yourself the trouble. —Why, at twelve years old, when I was a boy at Eton, I rode a sweepstakes at New-market— at thirteen I went the grand tour—at fourteen I came to London—was elected member of all the fashionable clubs, and laid out for by all the noto∣rious match-makers—but it wouldn't do—I was too old for them—ha! ha!—you grown-up peo∣ple think yourselves vastly elever: but you for∣get "Men are but children of a larger growth!"</P>

<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go along with you — and, instead of talking about that libertine, go and imitate Mrs. Scatter — copy my shepherdess.</P>

<P>Your shepherdess! — dear Sir, will you never see that you are imposed upon? — why, 'tis but yesterday I heard her tell my guardian, she was glad the sun shone so brightly, because —</P>

<P>Because doctor Fallible had told her, that a fortnight's hot weather would kill you to a certainty.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! — now, that's a lie on the face on't; for the doctor knows it's no such easy matter to kill me — no — no — he has prescribed for me these twenty years; and yet here I am alive and merry, and not likely to ride in one of his carriages for some time.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>STELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of the doctor's carriages! — why, he keeps none — he always walks.</P>

<P>Why, 'Squire, you just came in time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it seems — if I had staid ten minutes longer, I should have lost the coat off my back. — Oh, I see it all — I've been a credulous old fool, and you, Madam —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, uncle, it was no fault of mine — I was decoyed by that young hypocrite —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Decoyed by a boy! — more shame for you; and if you have no better excuse, prepare to quit my house directly — and your husband — take your fond shepherd along with you. — I've been too long a dupe to your arts; but henceforth I'll behave as a father ought to do — I'll be a friend to my son, and an enemy to all Burgundy-drinkers and faro-bankers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said! — I knew my lessons would improve you — you're a fine boy; and in time I shall make a man of you — but for you, Mrs. Scat∣ter — Ha! ha! — why what a sap you must be! — at your time of life to be beat by an urchin, a child, a half-finished composition! — Upon my word, you and your fond shepherd are the two greatest flats I ever met with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame! What right has a boy to affect manhood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>A better right than a woman has to affect
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>manhood. Which is best qualified to rattle a dice∣box — a boy or a woman? — Oh, man! man! — you'd better look about you! for if children grow so experienced, and women so masculine, you'll cer∣tainly meet your deserts — be deemed a superfluity, and shoved out of the creation! — but see — yon∣der's Mr. Scatter — go, go, and console the old gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. SCAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will: and he shall resent my in∣juries. — Don't fancy I'm mortified or vexed, or — no — I'm quite content—quite content! quite happy! Oh! oh! oh! <STAGE><HI>[Bursts into tears.]</HI></STAGE> — I'll be re∣venged, you may depend on't.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SPUNGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hallo! — won't you take a back hand for some silver spoons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, my little schoolmaster, how shall I thank you? to open my eyes — restore my son to me — instruct — advise! — Why, if you grow wiser as you grow older, Solomon will be a Cymon to you — but come — let's send for Tom, and all sit down to supper together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SPUNGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So we will — get better wine, though, damme! — get better wine — treat the little hero like a gentleman. — Come along — is n't he a noble youth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is — only, he'll excuse me — were I a boy like him, I wouldn't be so fond of playing hazard and faro.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>And were I a magistrate like you, there should be no hazard or faro at all: — I'd enforce the law, and not commit one poor culprit for decoying game, till I had destroyed all those rich ones, who ensnare unsuspecting youth, and annihilate domestic happiness.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>No — but Mr. Woodland's ser∣vants coming to our assistance, and seeing the pic∣ture — my old master's portrait in the carriage, they said — indeed, Sir — I cannot speak it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did they say, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>They said, the thief is found — charged my mistress with the robbery; and, not∣withstanding we told them she was your sister, they seized her and her companion as common malefactors, and carried them before the magistrate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What magistrate?</P>

<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh — if I forgive him this — Stella, this faithful servant will take care of you till I return — treated as a thief! — a malefactor, and by the man who betrayed — who — I can't support it — I feel I am a boy, and unequal to bear up against such complicated evils — but I forget my sister — follow me — I'm a man again.</P>

<P>I do, Sir.</P>

<P>Then bring them forward: let me have a look at them. <STAGE>[Elinor <HI>and</HI> Spunge <HI>are brought forward, she veiled, and he in a travelling dress.</HI>]</STAGE> First, who are you, Sir?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! it's come home to you, is it? Oh, this is an old offender. Make out a warrant for him directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SPUNGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An old offender! Lord! lord! when I lived at other people's expense, little did I dream of being hanged for it! — but if you punish me, pray spare her —pray spare Sir Edward's sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Edward's sister! Sir, not for the value of the picture do I suspect them of purloining it; but from some secret, some vin∣dictive motive: and [<HI>to Old</HI> Woodland] since they persist in using and degrading an innocent lady's name, I beg they may both be committed instantly.</P>

<P>So, pupil! <STAGE>[<HI>to Old</HI> W.]</STAGE> much good my lessons have done you — but I hav'n't time to finish your education — so, to school! to school, at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I go to school?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What's that to you, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; whats that to you, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Edward, think me not un∣grateful: but I have set such a value on that pic∣ture — my hopes and fears are so involved in it — that I must beg your sister to inform me, by what strange means it came in her possession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>She shall not answer you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not answer me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>No — shall not. Let that suffice, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care — on any other subject I could bear much with patience: but on this — not e'en from you —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! it galls you, does it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know it does. If she came fairly by the picture, there is no harm in answering the question — but if she purloined it — no matter what the motive — were she my sister — and being yours, I do esteem her as my own — I would not — nor I could not shew her mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Ironically.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No — the law must take its course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure it must — and is justice to be delayed, because she's your sister? — No; my young schoolmaster — the prisoners are found guilty.</P>

<P>Prisoners, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Aye, prisoners. They are con∣victed on the evidence of my son and my servants; and were they the first people in the land, it is my duty, as an honest magistrate, to send them to prison: therefore away with them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stole it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, stole it from a lady in France, Sir! — there's an act of robbery! — then you've sworn it is your own — there's an act of perjury! — then you would take away an innocent girl's life — there's an act of murder — therefore let her go — let her pursue her journey; or the rope you design for their necks shall be twisted round your own — I'll expose you — I'll expose you, Mr. Woodland!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your licentious tongue — isn't she proved guilty of the theft?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Theft! well, if she is — is she to suffer for purloining a piece of canvass, and you go un∣punished for stealing the dearest jewels in a woman's possession—honour, innocence, happiness?—is that law — is that justice? Look ye, Sir <STAGE>[<HI>to Old</HI> Wood∣land]</STAGE> — if you are the honest magistrate you de∣scribe yourself, let him be committed.

<P>Ay, look at the man now! — you call me profligate, Sir [<HI>to Old</HI> Woodland.] — no wonder if I am one, for when men set such opprobious exam∣ples, is it strange that boys grow up to infamy and ruin?</P>

<P>None. Come, Elinor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG WOOD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay — I only ask before we part for ever, that lady may be witness to my love and my remorse! — that I have wronged her my breaking heart can witness — for, from the day my uncle tore me from her — Oh! but for him, I had not known these agonies!</P>

<P>Psha! — it's too late now — what motive had you for accusing her?</P>

<P>Love! — I thought that it might lead to a discovery of all I held most dear, and it has! — I see her now before me! — I once again behold her! — yet in a moment I must lose them! — for ever lose all that I prize in friendship and in love!—Oh, Edward!—you used to call me brother!</P>

<LG>
<L>WELL! how d'-ye like the way of living cheap?—</L>
<L>What others sow with care with ease to reap.</L>
<L>Our friendly Bard has shewn you all the way</L>
<L>To share in ev'ry thing, yet nothing pay.</L>
<L>This Spunge is really an ingenious man—</L>
<L>Yet he but practices a modish plan;</L>
<L>Yes—he but represents a num'rous kind—</L>
<L>For ev'ry family its Spunge may find.</L>
<L>What are to them the burthens of the state!</L>
<L>Let grov'ling industry sustain the weight.</L>
<L>What is to them the mean parochial tax,</L>
<L>Who bear, like snails, their mansions on their backs</L>
<L>Should tradesmen clamour, and should writs assail,</L>
<L>The remedy's at hand—a friend must bail;</L>
<L>A friend, whose liberty is oft the price</L>
<L>That gives new scope to folly and to vice.</L>
<L>In short, at once the shifting tribe to draw,</L>
<L>A race of robbers, not pros<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rib'd by law.</L>
<L>Yet while our Bard would lash these men of prey,</L>
<L>Who live by shuffling arts from day to day;</L>
<L>Who, merely for some manual calling made,</L>
<L>Pretend to genius, and disdain a trade;</L>
<L>Ah! ne'er can he attempt, with wanton mirth,</L>
<L>To wound the man of real wit and worth;</L>
<L>To him, if fate the glitt'ring ore deny,</L>
<L>Wealth should with gen'rous pride the want supply;</L>
<L>For he, allur'd by fancy's dazzling rays,</L>
<L>Like summer myriads by the solar blaze;</L>
<L>Like them, too, thoughtless of the winter's cold,</L>
<L>The while surrounding sweets their charms unfold;</L>
<L>The world regarding as a transient toy,</L>
<L>And the true aim, the present to enjoy;</L>
<PB REF="75"/>
<L>Fondly relies on Fortune's future care,</L>
<L>And leaves the dull her lasting gifts to share.</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lines marked thus "were not spoken.</NOTE> "He gives the festive board its highest zest,</L>
<L>"Amid the pride of rank, a nobler guest.</L>
<L>"In his bright noon of life caress'd by all,</L>
<L>"Till for new fav'rites Fashion dooms his fall.</L>
<L>"A chequer'd fate his waning years endure,</L>
<L>"Rever'd, yet slighted, fam'd, and yet obscure;</L>
<L>"At length distress o'erwhelms him, friendship flies,</L>
<L>"He droops unnotic'd, and forgotten dies!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now, ye moral censors, spare the play,</L>
<L>That strives to rout the locusts of the day.</L>
<L>So may the Spunges live no more on spoil,</L>
<L>But useful prove, and thrive by honest toil.</L>
