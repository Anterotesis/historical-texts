<L>On nimble wings, but post-horses, I move.</L>
<L>Their idol's arms let Heathen bards recount,</L>
<L>This is <HI>my</HI> bow, I smack it, and I mount.</L>
<L>My spurs are pointed arrows in disguise,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I hope to live and breathe then, I know nothing at all of the matter. I wish I may be burned if I do. You are eternally suspecting me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be in a passion, Fillagree, don't be in a passion.—Zoons, 'tis I that ought to be in a passion. Has not my neighbour Flack been telling me here
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
for this twelvemonth past; Griskin, says he, that niece of yours will be ruined, will be undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is old Flack to me? let him trouble his head with his own business, and take care of his own daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there's a girl, Fillagree, there's a jewel of inestimable price! And a fine scholar too, Fil∣lagree; why her aunts tell me that she read through a whole circulating library once, in half a year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am out of patience!—Why are my ears to be stunned for ever with Miss Flack's perfections? Who can give a young lady a better education than myself? And have not I exerted all my abilities in accomplishing Miss Griskin?—But I see, after all the pains and trouble I have taken, you want to get rid of me—and so, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't, I don't, Fillagree.—But zoons, what does the education you have given her signify, if you contrive to ruin her at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I contrive to ruin her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why have not you always suffered this young fellow to be hankering about the house? Does not he <HI>drink tea</HI> forsooth with my niece and you? And are not you continually gadding to Islington with them on a Sunday? Ah Fillagree!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose we do go to Islington on a Sunday: is taking a little fresh air one day in the week such a mighty matter? Are not we stived to death here, in this narrow street, with a cheesemonger on one
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
side of us, and a tallow-chandler on the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zoons, am I against your taking the air? But why must Jemmy Twinkle be of the party?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he is a very genteel creditable young fellow, and the best company in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, there now; don't you allow that you admit him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I ever deny it? I like Mr. Jemmy most exceedingly. Lord, he talks so charmingly. He knows every thing that is done at the polite end of the town. He goes to the Bedford Coffee-house, and behind the scenes at the Play-houses, and tells one such comical stories of the wits, and the play∣ers, and the Covent-Garden ladies, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is all that stuff to him? Why does not he mind his own business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so he would if you did not prevent it. Stuff indeed! Lord help you. If Miss Griskin was my niece twenty thousand times over, and had twenty thousand times more money than she has, Jemmy should be the man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, there again! and yet you pretend to be angry at my suspecting you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I do, because you suspect me wrongfully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wrongfully? Why don't you say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no I tell you; I don't say any thing.—As
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
to the match, I approve of it. But you accuse me of being aiding and abetting in their elopement, as you call it. Now that I positively deny. For tho' I love young people should come together as well as any body; yet I always chuse it should be ho∣nourably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honourably?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, honourably. Why might not you and I, and the young couple, have gone a little party of pleasure together in a coach to Highgate, or on the water to Greenwich, and have had them married, and bedded honourably?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't make me mad. You know I could never consent to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And see what your hard-heartedness has pro∣duced. As the case stands now, were I in your place, I would pursue them to the world's end. Lord, I am frighted to death to think what may happen. Two young giddy people got together, without a prudent friend to advise them to moderate their passions, and put a bridle, as it were, upon their desires.—O, if you had heard the lessons I gave them when we walked to Islington. Indeed, I went with them for that very purpose. Mr. Jemmy, says I —Miss Griskin, says I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poo, Pox! What signifies what you said to them. How is one to find them now? Where can one go after them? ten to one they are gone away to Scotland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish they may with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wish they may!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, certainly. For if they will do a foolish thing, one should chuse to have it a fashionable one. They tell me that road is full of young couples: And Jemmy always loved to act like a person of distinction. O, he is not such a sneaking devil as you and old Flack are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean, Fillagree? What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what I mean, not I. You put one in a passion, and then one says any thing.— I ask your pardon.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>[In a grumbling manner, with a kind of half-curtsy.]</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I forgive it.—But what is to be done? I am half mad. Where shall I go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go! To every inn in town where they let post-horses. Inquire of every body you meet, man, woman, and child; and, if you hear any thing of them, drive after them immediately. You ought to be at Barnet already; for I dare swear they are gone to Scotland.—What do you stand fretting and teazing yourself for? Go, go, I say.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Pushing him to the door.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will, I will, Fillagree. Mercy upon me, I am in such a fidget!—Whither shall I go first?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any where, every where.—My poor, dear Miss, she may be ruined and undone by this time; and all from your monstruous behaviour. Get you
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
gone, can't you. You are as slow in preventing the mischief, as you was cruel in exposing her to it.—Come, come, I will force you out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN. (turning back and looking at her.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Fillagree!
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE. (looking after him, and mocking him.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Griskin!—an old curmudgeonly fellow! if it was not for me, there would be no spirit, po∣liteness, or generosity in the family.—Let me see that he is gone tho'. Yes, the door claps; and from this window I can observe which way he goes.—O, down the street, trot, trot, with his hands dangling, and his head noddling. O he is a sweet creature!—He has turned the corner; and now for my young lovers.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Opening a closet door.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Come out, ye couple of young handsome devils you, come out. Here have I been swearing thro' thick and thin for you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEMMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O my dear Mrs. Fillagree!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, you have a deal of gratitude at present; but how will it be a twelvemonth hence.—Hey, day, Miss! you look quite mournful. What is the matter with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what is the matter with me. I am not well, I believe, Fillagree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not well! Odd's my life, is this a time to be ill in? <Q>To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-mor∣row,“”</Q> as Mr. Jemmy used to say.—Why you
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
ought to be half way to Scotland by this time. Come, come, pluck up your spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heart misgives me, Fillagree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEMMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Miss!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does, indeed, Mr. Twinkle.—My uncle has been very good to me, and I have always be∣haved hitherto like a sober girl, and a very dutiful niece; and I should not care to forfeit that charac∣ter now I am grown a woman. I am sure Miss Flack would not do so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEMMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Racks and tortures!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, Miss, what is all this! Sober! duti∣ful! good to you! Who can have put such idle notions into your head? You have not told any body of your intentions besides me, have you?— I'll be hang'd if you have not been talking to Miss Flack.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, Fillagree. They are my own re∣flections. They came across me whilst I was shut up in that dark closet with Mr. Twinkle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEMMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why <HI>Mr. Twinkle,</HI> my angel? Why not your tender, your affectionate Jemmy, whose very soul is yours?—Can you forsake me? Can you for∣get you ever said you loved?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE, (aside to Jemmy.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay; ply her that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, Mr.—Mr. Jemmy, I love you as much as ever I did; and it goes to the heart of me
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
to refuse you.—This I can promise you, that I will never marry any other man as long as I live. Besides, I shall be of age, you know, in four or five years time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEMMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Four or five years! Four or five ages. Do you take me for an antediluvian? Any lover since the flood would have died with expectation in half that time.—Unkind and cruel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't accuse me of unkindness, Jemmy. Don't accuse me of that. I cannot bear that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>She softens.—Why these are arrant vapours, Miss. A journey in the fresh air is absolutely ne∣cessary for you. There is not a physician in Lon∣don but would prescribe it. The sooner you get into the chaise, and the further you go, the bet∣ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there again, Fillagree: to leave all one's friends and relations, and run into the wide world. —You know I never was ten miles from London in my life before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better. The air will do you the more good now.—I really don't know,
<STAGE>(<HI>to</HI> Jemmy)</STAGE>
whether she ought not to go part of the way on horseback.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, indeed, Fillagree, no: I cannot ride, —What do you look so melancholy for, Jemmy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JEMMY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you ask me that question? Did not you talk this moment of the wide world, of friends, of re∣lations? Ah! Miss Griskin, it is into these arms
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
you run, not the wide world. This amorous circle shall protect my fair one. I am every friend, every relation, in one; your lover, guardian, uncle, every thing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS, (with a sigh.)</SPEAKER>
<P>How charmingly he talks!—What would you advise me to, Fillagree? Shall I venture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure; and make as much haste as possible too; for the old man may be back every moment. Here, here, talk to her, whilst I fetch down the little band-box she is to carry in her lap.
<STAGE><HI>(Going. Returns.)</HI></STAGE>
You are sure you have every thing ready, and where the old fellow cannot possibly find you out?</P>

<P>I am glad of it, with all my heart. And have you brought them back?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no. They went for Scotland before day-break. But I shall be after them directly. There were four or five couple set out at the same time; and, by the description, they are all so like my niece and her sweet-heart, that one of the couples must be they.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you don't know that they were they for certain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you there were four or five couple, and they were all so like, that they must be among them. Why all London cannot afford another couple of the same sort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE. (Aside.)</SPEAKER>
<P>Five hundred at least.—We are pretty safe, I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we must not stand prating here. Our chaise will be at the door immediately. I ordered the boy to come as quietly as he could, and up the other end of the street, that the Flack family may know nothing of the matter. Therefore put up a shirt or two for <HI>me,</HI> and what little things you will for yourself, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FILLAGREE.</SPEAKER>
<P>For myself?—Why, do you think that I will go with you?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRISKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Fillagree.</P>

<P>Lud! Lud! I never had any wicked purposes.</P>

<P>How <HI>can</HI> you talk so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, can any thing be worse than a proposal to me now, which must sully my reputation with the whole neighbourhood. What do you think the Flack-family will say of <HI>me?</HI> Pray, Sir, have I ever behaved in your house in a manner to encourage it? My unspotted reputation!</P>

<P>Talk not of education, my education has un∣done me. Alas, Sir, from all my reading, I drew but one idea; 'twas that of love.

<P>My name, Sir, is Sotherton, Tom Sotherton, at your service. My profession is that of a strolling player. The accusation which is laid against me is undoubtedly a true one. And in order to account for my behaviour, with the leave of this good com∣pany,

<P>In plain English then, Sir, I went to town in hopes of being engaged at one of the theatres, when a

friend of mine pointed out to me the happier pros∣pect of succeeding with this young lady. He knew, pardon the expression, the romantic turn of her disposition:
<STAGE><HI>[The young men titter; the girls look down.]</HI></STAGE>
He told me likewise that she was cer∣tainly possessed of ten thousand pounds in her own disposal—"'Twas on that hint I spake."</P>

<P>It was last Monday was se'nnight, and it is now Wednesday, that I had the first opportunity of ad∣dressing her. She was turning the corner of a nar∣row street within ten yards of her own house, pas∣sing, as it should seem by the thread-paper in her hand, to a milliner's a few doors below. I gazed, I stopped, and expressed my admiration by a low bow. She blushed and curtsied. I seized her hand, she endeavoured to pull it from me. I pro∣tested my intentions were honourable, and she not only let me keep her hand, but kiss it. We began then to be afraid of observation. We parted; each with a sigh, but not without a promise of meeting again the next day, in the same place, at the same hour. In short, we met every day the whole week through, sometimes for a quarter of an hour, sometimes for half an hour; till at the last our lucky stars gave us an hour compleat; at which interview she kindly consented to elope with me.</P>

<P>The journey proceeded as the lady has already described. At Stilton, the post where she says my coldness began, an express overtook me, sent by the same kind friend who had first proposed the un∣dertaking.—Fatal express to both of us! for it in∣formed me that the ten thousand pounds were so far from being in Miss Flack's own power, that they depended not only on her father, but on a grandmother, and two maiden aunts. What then was to be done? Could I ruin the lady? Could I ruin myself? No, with a truly heroic resolution, I stifled my own passion, and by pretended ill usage endeavoured to put an end to her's.</P>
