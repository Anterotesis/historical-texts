<P>THE <HI>EDINBURGH SOCIETY</HI>
for the encouragement of arts, sciences, ma∣nufactures,
and agriculture proposed, in the
year 1755, <HI>a gold medal</HI> to <HI>the best ESSAY</HI>
on <HI>TASTE;</HI> and, not having assigned it that
year, repeated the proposal in 1756. This
determined the author to enter on the following
enquiry into the nature of Taste; the general
principles of which only he presented to the So∣ciety,
suspecting that the whole might exceed the
limits which they had fixed, by requiring an
<HI>essay.</HI> The judges appointed for that sub∣ject,
having been pleased to assign the premium
to him, he is encouraged to offer the whole, as
it was at first composed, to the public.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON
TASTE.</HEAD>
<P>A FINE taste is neither wholly the
gift of <HI>nature,</HI> nor wholly the effect
of <HI>art.</HI> It derives its origin from
certain powers natural to the mind; but these
powers cannot attain their full perfection;
unless they be assisted by proper culture.
Taste consists chiefly in the improvement of
those principles, which are commonly called
<HI>the powers of imagination,</HI> and are considered
by modern philosophers as <HI>internal</HI> or <HI>reflex
senses</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hutcheson</HI> was the first who considered the powers of imagination as so many senses. In his <HI>Enquiry concerning beauty and virtue,</HI> and his <HI>Essay on the passions,</HI> he calls them <HI>internal</HI> senses. In his later works, he terms them <HI>subsequent</HI> and <HI>reflex</HI> senses; <HI>subsequent,</HI> because they always suppose some previous perception of the objects, about which they are employed; thus a perception of harmony presupposes our hearing certain founds, and is totally distinct from merely hear∣ing them, since many, who enjoy the external sense of hearing in the greatest perfection, have no musical ear; <HI>reflex,</HI> be∣cause in order to their exertion, the mind reflects upon and takes notice of some circumstance or mode of the object that was perceived, besides those qualities, which offered them∣selves to its attention at first view. Thus the perception of any object does not give us the pleasant sentiment of novelty, till we have reflected on this circumstance, that we never perceived it formerly. In the following Essay the terms <HI>internal sense</HI> and <HI>reflex sense</HI> are used promiscuously.</NOTE>, supplying us with finer and more
delicate perceptions, than any which can be
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
properly referred to our external organs.
These are reducible to the following princi∣ples;
the senses of novelty, of sublimity, of
beauty, of imitation, of harmony, of ridi∣cule,
and of virtue. With the explication
of these, we must, therefore, begin our en∣quiry
into the nature of <HI>taste.</HI> We shall
next endeavour to discover, how these senses
co-operate in forming <HI>taste,</HI> what other pow∣ers
of the mind are combined with them in
their exertions, what constitutes that refine∣ment
and perfection of them, which we
term <HI>good taste,</HI> and by what means it is ob∣tained.
And last of all, we shall, by a re∣view
of the principles, operation, and sub∣jects
of <HI>taste,</HI> determine its genuine rank
among our faculties, its proper province, and
real importance.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the sense or taste of novelty.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind receives pleasure or pain,
not only from the impulse of external
objects, but also from the consciousness of its
own operations and dispositions. When these
are produced by external objects, the pleasure
or the pain, which arises immediately from
the exertions of the mind, is ascribed to those
things, which give occasion to them. We
have a pleasant sensation, whenever the mind
is in a lively and elevated temper. It attains
this temper, when it is forced to exert its ac∣tivity,
and put forth its strength, in order to
surmount any difficulty: and if its efforts
prove successful, consciousness of the success
inspires new joy. Hence moderate difficul∣ty,
such as exercises the mind, without fa∣tiguing
it, is pleasant, and renders the object
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
by which it is produced agreeable. Even
plainness and perspicuity becomes displeasing
in an Author, when it is carried to excess,
and leaves no room for exercising the read∣er's
thought: and though great obscurity
disgusts us, yet we are highly gratified by de∣licacy
of sentiment, which always includes
some degree of it, occasions a suspense of
thought, and leaves the full meaning to be
guessed at, and comprehended only on atten∣tion
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Some critics have explained this gratification, either by supposing imaginary refinements of reflection, or by principles which are only consequences of the pleasure that attends the moderate exercise of thought. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

Dial.</BIBL></NOTE>▪ The exercise of thought, which mo∣derate
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
difficulty produces, is a principal source
of the pleasure we take in study and investi∣gation
of every kind; for though the utility
of many subjects enhances our satisfaction,
yet the former principle, without any aid from
this, often renders very great labour, not only
supportable, but agreeable. Witness the de∣light,
with which antiquaries bestow indefa∣tigable
pains on recovering or illustrating an∣cient
fragments, recommended only by their
age, and obscurity, and scarce apprehended
to be, on any other account, of great impor∣tance.
This is in general the cause of our
pleasure in all enquiries of mere curiosity.</P>
<P>NOT only the performance of actions, but
also the conception of most objects, to which
we have not been accustomed, is attended
with difficulty. On this account, when <HI>new</HI>
objects are in themselves indifferent, the ef∣forts,
that are necessary for conceiving them,
exalt and enliven the frame of the mind,
make it receive a strong impression from them,
and thus render them in some measure agree∣able.
When the objects are in themselves
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
agreeable, these efforts heighten our satisfac∣tion.
A fine country or an agreeable pro∣spect
is doubly beautiful to a stranger. It
gives considerable exercise to the mind, to
observe every part of it, and to conceive the
situation of the several objects, which it in∣cludes.
A fresh discovery in science, or a
new performance in the arts gives greater sa∣tisfaction,
when we become first acquainted
with it, than ever after. The first time that
we study a philosophical theory, the mind
runs through it with eagerness, that it may
get a view of all its parts, is constantly en∣gaged
in tracing the connection of the argu∣ments,
in examining their force, in conceiv∣ing
what objections can be formed against
them, and is by this means affected with an
agreeable agitation, which ceases, after repeat∣ed
perusals have rendered the theory familiar
to us. A poem or a picture is examined,
with a similar ardour and unremitted exertion
of mind, by a person who has not seen it for∣merly.</P>
<P>THOUGH a new object be so simple as to be
conceived without any difficulty, there are
some situations, in which it will give exercise
to the mind, and will, for this reason, be agree∣able.
It is extremely disagreeable, to be sunk
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
into indolence and languor, without any thing
to awaken our attention, or give play to our
faculties. This state is almost unavoidable,
when we are long confined to the contem∣plation
of a single object, or when the same
object recurs very often to our view. In this
case, it soon becomes so familiar, that the
impression, which it makes upon the mind,
is too faint to give it any exercise. Memory
retains all the parts of the object so distinctly,
that it outruns sense, and, before we have
surveyed them, informs us, that we are per∣fectly
acquainted with them already. We
find ourselves cloyed, and immediately turn
from the object with disgust. Any new ob∣ject
will, in this situation, be agreeable; it
occurs opportunely to occupy the mind, when
it was at a loss how to employ itself; it
frees us from the pain of satiety and languor;
it gives an impulse to the mind, and
puts it in motion. This is always pleasant,
but its pleasure is greatly augmented by the
uneasiness from which it has relieved us.
This is a pleasure which most men taste eve∣ry
day, by varying their studies, their busi∣ness,
or their recreations. When genuine
elegance in furniture or architecture has
been long the fashion, men sometimes grow
weary of it, and imitate the <HI>Chinese,</HI> or revive
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
the <HI>Gothic</HI> taste, merely for the pleasure they
receive from what is unlike to those things,
which they have been accustomed to see.
The pleasure of novelty is, in this case, pre∣ferred
to that which results from real beauty.</P>
<P>IF there are some things, whose novelty
produces no degree of pleasure, it arises from
their not at all enlivening the thought, or
exercising the mind. If their novelty is even
painful, it proceeds from their exciting some
other sensation, which destroys the pleasure
naturally attendant on the novelty. The ex∣ercise
of mind, which the conception of new
objects occasions, though it be pleasant in its
own nature, renders a disagreeable object more
disagreeable at first: for the most opposite
sensations produced by the same cause, and
existing in the mind at once, are easily trans∣fused
into one another, and, by their com∣position
form one more violent, which al∣ways
follows the nature of the ingredient that
was most intense.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the elevation and exertion of
mind, which springs from the mere difficulty
of conceiving a new object, or from the live∣liness
of a new perception, is attended with
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
surprise, which augments our delight or un∣easiness,
by farther enlivening the thought
and agitating the mind. For this reason, the
poet and the orator, not only solicitously
avoid sentiments and modes of expression
which are trite and common, and search
through all the stores of nature for images,
figures, and illustrations, which have not
been appropriated by their predecessors; but
also study to contrive the structure of their
compositions in such a manner, that the
commonest thoughts and arguments may sur∣prise
by the unexpectedness of their intro∣duction
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Est enim grata in eloquendo novitas et commutatio, et magis inopinata delectant. <BIBL><HI>Quint. Inst. Orat.</HI> lib. viii. cap. 6.</BIBL></NOTE>. Even the historian, who is
confined to known materials and facts, en∣deavours
to give them the appearance of no∣velty,
by the light in which he represents
them, and by his own reflections on the cau∣ses,
the effects, and the nature of the trans∣actions
he narrates. Novelty can bestow
charms on a monster, and make things plea∣sant,
which have nothing to recommend
them but their rarity.</P>
<P>IN like manner, any agreeable passion or
emotion, which a new object happens to
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
produce, will run into the pleasant sentiment
that naturally arises from its novelty, and will
augment it. A new suit gives pleasure to a
child, by its being different from his former;
it likewise excites his pride, and gives him an
expectation of attracting the notice of his
companions. It gratifies the vanity of a fine
lady, to be among the first in a fashion; it
seems to proclaim her rank, to distinguish
her from the vulgar, and to command
respect.</P>
<P>THE pleasure of novelty is sometimes also
heightened by reflection. When the con∣ception
of an object is attended with very
considerable difficulty, the pleasure which
we feel in the exertion of mind, necessary
for overcoming this difficulty, is increased by
the joy, with which we reflect on our suc∣cess
in having surmounted it. When objects
are of such a nature that we reckon our ac∣quaintance
with them an acquisition in know∣ledge,
the pleasure of their novelty arises in
part from the satisfaction, with which we
reflect on our having made this acquisition.
Both these circumstances, the conciousness
of success, and the opinion of improvement,
contribute to that delight, which a mathema∣tician
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
enjoys, the first time that he compre∣hends
a difficult and curious demonstration.</P>
<P>IT may be farther observed, that novelty
in the works of genius and art derives addi∣tional
charms from another principle, to be
explained afterwards, the ingenuity which it
shews. To strike out a new track, to exe∣cute
what was not attempted before, displays
original genius, which we always observe
with pleasure.</P>

<HEAD>SECT.II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the sense or taste of grandeur and
sublimity.</HEAD>
<P>GRANDEUR or sublimity gives us a
still higher and nobler pleasure, by
means of a sense appropriated to the percep∣tion
of it; while meanness renders any ob∣ject,
to which it adheres, disagreeable and
distasteful. Objects are sublime, which pos∣sess
<HI>quantity</HI> or amplitude, and <HI>simplicity</HI> in
conjunction<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Most of the species of sublimity are explained, nearly from the principles here assigned, in <HI>An Essay on the sublime,</HI> by Dr. <HI>Baillie.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>CONSIDERABLE <HI>magnitude</HI> or largeness of
extension, in objects capable of it, is necessary
to produce sublimity. It is not on a small
rivulet, however transparent and beautifully
winding; it is not on a narrow valley, though
variegated with flowers of a thousand pleasing
hues; it is not on a little hill, though cloath∣ed
with the most delightful verdure, that we
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
bestow the epithet <HI>sublime:</HI> but on the <HI>Alps,</HI>
the <HI>Nile,</HI> the ocean, the wide expanse of hea∣ven,
or the immensity of space uniformly ex∣tended,
without limit or termination<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE always contemplate objects and ideas
with a disposition similar to their nature.
When a large object is presented, the mind
expands itself to the extent of that object,
and is filled with one grand sensation, which
totally possessing it, composes it into a solemn
sedateness, and strikes it with deep silent
wonder and admiration: it finds such a diffi∣culty
in spreading itself to the dimensions of
its object, as enlivens and invigorates its
frame: and having overcome the opposition
which this occasions, it sometimes imagines
itself present in every part of the scene, which
it contemplates; and, from the sense of this
immensity, feels a noble pride, and entertains
a lofty conception of its own capacity<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Longinus</HI> contents himself with resolving the sensation of sublimity into the <HI>la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> of these principles, without investigat∣ing the others, of which <HI>it</HI> is but a consequence. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="19"/>
LARGE objects can scarce indeed produce
their full effect, unless they are also <HI>simple,</HI> or
made up of parts, in a great measure similar.
Innumerable little islands scattered in the
ocean, and breaking the prospect, greatly di∣minish
the grandeur of the scene. A va∣riety
of clouds, diversifying the face of the
heavens, may add to their beauty, but must
detract from their grandeur<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">It is not meant that, in these cases, the sublimity of the ocean, or of the heavens, is destroyed; it is only asserted that it is diminished. A considerable degree of sublimity will remain, on account of the similarity, that still subsists among the parts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OBJECTS cannot possess that largeness,
which is necessary for inspiring a sensation of
the sublime, without simplicity. Where
this is wanting, the mind contemplates, not
one large, but many small objects<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Simplicity is recommended, by an antient critic, as re∣quisite to sublimity in painting, on the very principle here assigned, which must render its necessity universal, as it ex∣tends equally to every other subject. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It is on the same princi∣ple that <HI>Longinus</HI> accounts for the production of the sublime, by expressing in the singular, what is ordinarily expressed in the plural. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>: it is
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
pained with the labour requisite to creep
from one to another; and is disgusted with the
imperfection of the idea, with which, even
after all this toil, it must remain contented.
But we take in, with ease, one entire con∣ception
of a simple object, however large: in
consequence of this facility, we naturally ac∣count
it one: the view of any single part
suggests the whole, and enables fancy to ex∣tend
and enlarge it to infinity, that it may fill
the capacity of the mind.</P>
<P>MANY things are indeed denominated sub∣lime,
which, being destitute of extension,
seem incapable of amplitude, the first and fun∣damental
requisite of the sublime. But such
objects will be found, on examination, to
possess qualities, which have the same power
to exalt the disposition of the observer.
Length of duration; prodigious numbers of
things similar united, or so related, as to con∣stitute
a whole, partake of the nature of <HI>quan∣tity,</HI>
and, as well as extension, enlarge and
elevate the mind, which contemplates them.
Eternity is an object, which fills the whole
capacity of the soul, nay exceeds its compre∣hension;
and strikes it with astonishment and
admiration. We cannot survey a vast army
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
or navy, without being sensible of their gran∣deur;
which arises, not so much from the
largeness of the space they occupy, as from
the numbers of men or ships, which are in
them united under one direction, and co-ope∣rate
to a common end; the union and simi∣litude
of the parts adding <HI>simplicity</HI> to the
<HI>vastness</HI> of their number. Hence too is de∣rived
the sublime of science, which lies in
universal principles and general theorems,
from which, as from an inexhaustible source,
flow multitudes of corollaries and subordinate
truths.</P>
<P>BUT do not we attribute grandeur and
sublimity to some things, which are destitute
of <HI>quantity</HI> of every kind? What can be more
remote from quantity, than the passions and
affections of the soul? Yet the most imperfect
and uncultivated taste is sensible of a subli∣mity
in heroism, in magnanimity, in a con∣tempt
of honours, of riches, of power, in a
noble superiority to things external, in pa∣triotism,
in universal benevolence. To ac∣count
for this, we must observe, that, as
no passion can subsist without its causes, its
objects, and its effects, so, in forming the
idea of any passion, we do not satisfy our∣selves
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
with conceiving it as a simple emotion
in the mind, but we run over, in thought,
the objects about which it is employed, the
things by which it is produced, and the ef∣fects
by which it discovers itself. And as
these always enter into our conception of the
passion, and are often connected with quan∣tity,
they naturally render the passion sub∣lime.
What wonder that we esteem hero∣ism
grand, when, in order to imagine it, we
suppose a mighty conqueror, in opposition
to the most formidable dangers, acquiring
power over <HI>multitudes</HI> of nations, subjecting
to his dominion wide <HI>extended</HI> countries, and
purchasing renown, which reaches to the
extremities of the world, and shall continue
through <HI>all the ages</HI> of futurity? What can
be more truly great than the object of that
benevolence, which, unconsined by the nar∣row
limits of vicinity or relation, compre∣hends
<HI>multitudes,</HI> grasps whole <HI>large</HI> socie∣ties,
and even extends from pole to pole?</P>
<P>IT must also be remarked, that whatever
excites in the mind a sensation or emotion
similar to what is excited by vast objects is
on this account denominated sublime; it be∣ing
natural to reduce to the same species, to
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
express by the same name, and even fre∣quently
to confound together those objects,
which we contemplate with the same or a
like disposition. Hence the raging of the
sea in a storm, and the loud roaring thunder▪
which inspire an awful sedateness, are termed
sublime. Objects exciting terror are, for
this reason, in general sublime; for terror
always implies astonishment, occupies the
whole soul, and suspends all its motions.</P>
<P>IN like manner, we admire as sublime su∣perior
excellence of many kinds; such emi∣nence
in strength, or power, or genius, as
is uncommon, and overcomes difficulties,
which are insurmountable by lower degrees
of ability; such vigour of mind, as indicates
the absence of low and groveling passions, and
enables a person to despise honours, riches,
power, pain, death; setting him above
those enjoyments, on which men generally
put an high value, and those sufferings,
which they think intolerable. Such degrees
of excellence excite wonder and astonishment,
the same emotion which is produced by am∣plitude.
A great degree of <HI>quality</HI> has here
the same effect upon the mind, as vastness of
<HI>quantity,</HI> and that by the same principles, by
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
stretching and elevating the mind in the con∣ception
of it.</P>
<P>WE shall but just observe that the sublime
passions, habitually prevailing in the temper,
and uniformly displaying themselves in suita∣ble
expressions and effects, constitute dignity
and sublimity of character.</P>
<P>BUT in order to comprehend the whole
extent of the sublime, it is proper to take no∣tice
that objects, which do not themselves
possess that quality, may nevertheless acquire
it, by <HI>association</HI> with such as do. It is the
nature of association to unite different ideas
so closely, that they become in a manner
one. In that situation, the qualities of one
part are naturally attributed to the whole, or
to the other part. At least association ren∣ders
the transition of the mind from one idea
to another so quick and easy, that we con∣template
both with the same disposition, and
are therefore similarly affected by both.
Whenever, then, any object uniformly and
constantly introduces into the mind the idea
of another that is grand, it will, by its con∣nexion
with the latter, be itself rendered
grand. Hence words and phrases are deno∣minated
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
lofty and majestic. Sublimity of
style arises, not so much from the sound of
the words, though that doubtless may have
some influence, as from the nature of the
ideas, which we are accustomed to annex to
them, and the character of the persons,
among whom they are in most common use.
This too is the origin of the grandeur we as∣cribe
to objects high and elevated in place;
of the veneration, with which we regard
things in any direction distant; and of the
superior admiration excited by things remote
in time; especially in antiquity or past du∣ration<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">The author of <HI>a Treatise of Human Nature</HI> has very in∣geniously reduced these phaenomena into the principle of asso∣ciation. B. ii. P. 3, S. 8. The sum of his reasoning, so far as it is necessary to take notice of it here, is as follows. “Be∣cause we are accustomed every moment to observe the difficulty with which things are raised in opposition to the impulse of gravity; the idea of ascending always implies the notion of force exerted in overcoming this difficulty; the conception of which invigorates and elevates the thought, after the same manner as a vast object, and thus gives a distance above us much more an appearance of greatness, than the same space could have in any other direction. The sensation of ampli∣tude, which by this means comes to attend the interposed distance, is transferred to, and considered as excited by the ob∣ject that is eminent and above us; and that object, by this transference, acquires grandeur and sublimity. And here we may observe in passing, that this natural tendency to associate ideas of grandeur with things above us is the reason, why the term <HI>sublime</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s metaphorically applied to excellence of any kind, especially to that species of it, which elates the mind with noble pride in the conception. To our transferring, in like manner, the interposed space, and its attendant sensation, to the distant object, is owing the veneration, with which we regard, and the value we set upon things remote in place. And because we find greater difficulty, and must employ su∣perior energy, in running over the parts of duration, than those of space; and in ascending through past duration, than in descending through what is future; therefore we value higher, and contemplate with greater veneration things distant in time than things remote in space, and the persons and objects of antiquity, than those which we figure to ourselves in the ages of futurity.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="26"/>
BUT the fine arts present the most nume∣rous
examples of grandeur produced by asso∣ciation.
In all of them, the sublime is at∣tained,
chiefly by the artist's exciting <HI>ideas</HI> of
sublime objects; and in such as are mimical,
this quality is chiefly owing to our being led
by the exactness of the imitation to form
ideas and conceive images of sublime originals.
Thought is a less intense energy than sense:
Yet <HI>ideas,</HI> especially when lively, never fail
to be contemplated with some degree of the
same emotion, which attends their original
<HI>sensations;</HI> and often yield almost equal plea∣sure
to the reflex senses, when impressed up∣on
the mind by a skilful imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="27"/>
GRANDEUR in works of architecture may,
in some instances, arise from their largeness:
for we generally estimate the magnitude of
things, by comparison with those of the
same species: and though no edifice is equal
in quantity to many works of nature by no
means accounted great; yet losty palaces and
pyramids, far exceeding the bulk of other
buildings, have a <HI>comparative</HI> magnitude, which
has the same influence upon the mind, as if
hey had been <HI>absolutely</HI> large. But still the
principal source of grandeur in architecture
is <HI>association,</HI> by which the columns suggest
ideas of strength and durability, and the
whole structure introduces the sublime ideas
of the riches and magnificence of the owner.</P>
<P>IN painting, sublimity is sometimes intro∣duced
by an artful kind of disproportion,
which assigns to some well chosen member a
greater degree of <HI>quantity</HI> than it commonly
has<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Thus, according to <HI>Hogarth,</HI> the inexpressible greatness of the Apollo Belvidere arises from the uncommon length of the legs and thighs. <HI>Analysis of Beauty,</HI> ch. II.</NOTE>: but chiefly those performances are

them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><P>It may be here observed that, though the figures, in painting, can seldom have so great quantity, as is sufficient of itself to produce sublimity; yet the comparative <HI>magnitude,</HI> and also the <HI>simplicity</HI> of the figures, parts, and members, are among the principal means by which a work suggests sublime ideas, and thus becomes itself sublime. The preservation of magnitude and simplicity is therefore recommended as funda∣mental to sublimity, in the art of painting.</P>

features and attitudes of the figures, lead us
to conceive sublime passions operating in the
originals. And so complete is the power of
association, that a skillful painter can express
any degree of sublimity in the smallest, as
well as in the largest compass. It appears
in the miniatures of <HI>Julio Clovio,</HI> as really as
in the paintings of <HI>Titian</HI> or <HI>Michelangelo.</HI></P>
<P>THE sublime of those arts, in which the
instrument of imitation is language, must
evidently arise entirely from association; as it
is the only principle, from which words de∣rive
their force and meaning. And in these
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
arts, sublimity precisely considered, will be
found resolvable into a very few general qua∣lities.</P>
<P>THE poet or the orator is then possessed
of this excellence, when the sentiments he
utters, or the subjects he professedly describes,
contain in themselves the sublime, either of
nature, or of the passions and character: and
the grander the originals are, the greater is
the sublimity of the imitation. Whence, in
classing sentiments that are sublime, the first
place is assigned by critics, to those which
have a relation to the Gods<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. When
<HI>Homer</HI> would convey a sublime idea of DIS∣CORD,
he gives greatness of quantity to this
imaginary person, assigning her such prodi∣gious
stature, that, while she walks upon the
earth, her head reaches to the heavens.</P>

<P><PB N="26" REF="30"/>
THE sublimity of the rival sentiments of
the two latin poets, with respect to <HI>Cato,</HI>
arises in like manner from the grandeur of
the subject, from the dignity of the character
described.</P>
<Q><L>Et cuncta terrarum subacta</L>

<BIBL>HOR.</BIBL>
<Q>Secretosque pios, his dantem jura Catonem.</Q>
<BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL>
<P>ON account of the superior grandeur of
the subject, the latter claims an undoubted
preference. The former indeed derives ad∣ditional
force from the art of the composition,
by means of which the first hint of an excep∣tion
from <HI>Caesar's</HI> power occasions a suspense of
thought, a kind of anxious expectation, which,
mixing with the sublime sensation, heightens
it. Subjects thus grand in themselves must
bestow sublimity on a composition, whenever
they are described in such a manner, as con∣veys
entire, or augments, the feeling, which
they naturally excite.</P>
<P>IF an author's main subject is destitute of
innate grandeur, it may be rendered grand,
by comparing or someway associating it with
<PB N="27" REF="31"/>
objects naturally such. By the same means
the real greatness of a subject is increased.
Hence metaphor, comparison, and imagery
are often productive of sublimity<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. <HI>Cicero</HI>
raises <HI>Caesar's</HI> idea of clemency, by represent∣ing
it as godlike<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Homines ad Deos nulla re propius accedunt, quam sa∣lute hominibus danda. <HI>Pro Ligar.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>Seneca</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Illud ingenium, quod solum populus Romanus par im∣perio suo habuit. <BIBL><HI>Controv.</HI> lib. i.</BIBL></NOTE> gives a sub∣lime
idea of <HI>Cicero's</HI> genius, by comparing it
with the majesty and extent of the <HI>Roman</HI>
empire. The effect of the comparison is
sometimes augmented, by the writer's insinu∣ating
the superiority of his subject to that,
with which he compares it, and artfully an∣nexing
some circumstances to the latter,
which, without rendering it mean (for that
would destroy the effect of the comparison)
yet depress it below the former. In this way
<HI>Homer</HI> contrives to give a great idea of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> army, by introducing <HI>Priam</HI> speak∣ing
magnificently of the armies he had for∣merly

By the same means, an <HI>Italian</HI> poet represents
<HI>Venice,</HI> which he celebrates, as greater than

<P><HI>Venice</HI> becomes grand by the metaphori∣cal

acknowleged great, but at the same time pur∣posely
degraded, by the opposition of <HI>Tyber</HI>
to <HI>pelagus,</HI> and its relation to men. The
power of imparting sublimity to objects which
naturally have it not, by giving them a rela∣tion
to others, is an advantage peculiar to the
arts, which imitate by language; for the rest
can attain the sublime, only by copying such
objects as are themselves possessed of that
quality<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">It is perhaps necessary to repeat, that we here intend only the sublime precisely considered; for the term is often used to signify any great excellence of composition. It is thus defined by <HI>Longinus;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. In this latitude he explains it, treating of the nervous, the vehement, and even the beautiful and elegant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33"/>
THE principles we have laid down ex∣plain
also the sublime of music; which
seems to be derived in part from the length
and the gravity of the notes; the former con∣stituting
a kind of amplitude to the ear;
the latter contributing to that composure and
sedate expansion of the mind, which attends
the perception of sublimity; and is then com∣pleated,
when the artist, by skilfully imitat∣ing
the sublime passions or their objects, in∣spires
them into his hearers, and renders them
conscious of their operation.</P>
<P>IT is farther proper to observe, that things
may be destitute of grandeur, and yet not be
accounted low or mean; but may, on the
contrary, possess other qualities, which gratify
us highly in a different way. It is only when
grandeur is requisite and expected, that the
mere absence of it produces meanness. Thus
a remarkable defect in quantity, in compari∣son
with things of the same kind; a resem∣blance
in individuals of a superior species to
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
the orders below them; or the defect of
sublimity in compositions of art or genius,
which propose to imitate originals or treat
subjects confessedly noble, gives us distaste
and inspires contempt. Meanness arises often
likewise from association, when low and gro∣veling
ideas are suggested; as when images
and similes, taken from mean objects, are
applied to an important subject. Thus also,
words and phrases become mean, when they
excite mean ideas, either by their proper sig∣nification,
or by their being ordinarily used
only by those of inferiour rank.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the sense or taste of Beauty.</HEAD>
<P>BEAUTIFUL objects are of different
kinds, and produce pleasure by means
of different principles of human nature.</P>
<P>THE first species of beauty is that of <HI>figure,</HI>
and belongs to objects possessed of <HI>uniformity,
variety,</HI> and <HI>proportion.</HI> Each of these qua∣lities
pleases in some degree; but all of them
united give exquisite satisfaction.</P>
<P>FACILITY in the conception of an object,
if it is moderate, gives us pleasure: the mind
thinks well of itself, when it is able to form
it's conception without pain or labour. This
constitutes the value of perspicuity of thought
and language, which is agreeable in opposi∣tion
to obscurity, as this occasions an uneasy
search into the meaning of the parts or the
tendency of the whole, which requires greater
labour than we are willing to bestow. Hence
too it is that <HI>uniformity</HI> and <HI>simplicity</HI> become
agreeable. Objects endued with these qua∣lities
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
enter easily into the mind: they do
not distract our attention, or hurry us too
fast from one scene to another: the view of
a part suggests the whole, and, impelling the
mind to imagine the rest, produces a grateful
exertion of its energy.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, in all the beautiful works
of nature, uniformity is preserved in the ge∣neral
appearance of the correspondent parts.
And though a perfectly accurate regularity is
avoided, both in natural effects and in the
fine arts; yet so much of it must be retained,
as to keep the variety from degenerating into
perplexity and confusion. Regular figures
are in general preferred to irregular; and
such as have parallel sides to such as have
not. Equality is requisite to the beauty of
every piece of painting<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><L>Altera pars tabulae vacuo ne frigida campo,</L>
<L>Aut deserta siet, dum pluribus altera formis</L>
<L>Fervida mole sua supremam exurgit ad oram.</L>

<L>Aequiparet, geminas cumulando aequaliter oras.</L>
<BIBL>FRESN. de Art. Graph. ver. 145.</BIBL></NOTE>. Even when a
perfect similarity in the appearance of the
counterparts seems to be studiously shunned,
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
as in a side view of a human face, the atti∣tude
of the body, or the profile of a build∣ing;
yet still it must be so contrived, that,
though it does not exhibit a <HI>sensation,</HI> it may
notwithstanding, according to the rules of
perspective, suggest the <HI>idea</HI> of exact uni∣formity.
To bestow simplicity upon a mul∣titude
of separate phaenomena, the philoso∣pher
traces them up to common qualities,
and general causes; and it is only when he
has done so, that the beauty of science be∣gins<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Uniformity and simplicity are, strictly speaking, distinct ideas; the former implying the similarity of the correspondent parts; the latter the fewness of unlike parts in the whole ob∣ject. But as both please by the same principle, it was judged unnecessary precisely to distinguish them here.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT uniformity, when perfect and un∣mixed,
is apt to pall upon the sense, to grow
languid, and to sink the mind into an uneasy
state of indolence. It cannot therefore alone
produce pleasure, either very high, or of very
long duration. <HI>Variety</HI> is necessary to enli∣ven
it. Where this is wanting, uniformity
degenerates into dull formality. Variety in
some measure gratifies the sense of novelty,
as our ideas vary in passing from the contem∣plation
of one part to that of another. This
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
transition puts the mind in action, and gives
it employment, the consciousness of which is
agreeable<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Intricacy,</HI> which often greatly contributes to beauty, may be considered as a species of <HI>variety;</HI> at least its agreea∣bleness is derived from the same cause; and variety is most naturally combined with uniformity, intricacy with simplici∣ty.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the works of nature we find variety
studiously sought after, as in the uneven sur∣face
of the globe; the infinity of shapes and
hues in the flowers that adorn it; the intri∣cate
windings of rivers; the wildnesses of na∣ture,
which we even set ourselves to copy by
art; and in ten thousand other instances.
To procure it, the Architect enriches his
buildings with ornaments of different forms.
In all works of taste, too great uniformity is
avoided by numberless graceful attitudes, by
varying of members, and by contrasting the
parts<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><L>Inque Figura<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um cumulis non omnibus idem</L>
<L>Corporis inflexus, motusque; vel artubus omnes</L>

<L>Transverseque aliis pugnent, et caetera frangant.</L>
<BIBL>FRESN. <HI>de Art. Graph.</HI> ver. 137.</BIBL>
<P>So great is the power of variety in producing beauty, that an∣ingenious artist, who has lately <HI>analysed</HI> it, not altogether with∣out reason, resolves almost the whole of it into that principle and defines the art of composing to be nothing else but “the art of varying well.” He holds uniformity no further ne∣cessary, than it is requisite to convey the idea of rest or motion, without possibility of falling. But here he goes too far. It were easy to point out instances, where uniformity is studied, though it cannot have any degree of this effect: and he ac∣knowleges that beauty resides only in a <HI>composed</HI> variety; which necessarily implies a mixture of uniformity. He indeed suf∣ficiently proves that uniformity is not the only, or chief princi∣ple of perfect beauty. Yet it often by itself constitutes some degree of it; as in the straight and parallel sides of a canal.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="39"/>
WERE the variety indeed boundless, the
mind would be fatigued and pained with con∣tinual
shifting from part to part, without the
prospect of any end of its labour: it would
be displeased and disgusted, when it found
that, after numberless efforts to conceive
the object, the endless dissimilitude and per∣plexed
composition of the parts still baffled
its endeavours, and hindered it from perfect∣ing
its idea. A certain degree of uniformity
must therefore be blended with the variety of
objects; otherways this variety, instead of
producing moderate energy, would subject us
to insurmountable toil, which would make
our pleasure soon degenerate into pain.</P>
<P>THESE two qualities, by thus moderating
the effects of one another, increase the plea∣sure
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
resulting from each: giving the mind at
once the opposite gratifications of facility and
active exertion, mixed with, and mellowing
one another.</P>
<P>PROPORTION consists not so much in re∣lations
of the parts precisely mensurable, as
in a general aptitude of the structure to the
end proposed; which experience enables us
instantaneously to perceive, better than any
artificial methods can determine it. Its in∣fluence
on beauty is therefore derived from
<HI>fitness</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See HOGARTH'S <HI>Analysis of Beauty,</HI> Chap. xi.</NOTE>, a principle which will be illustra∣ted
presently.</P>
<P>A VERY small disproportion in any of the
members of the human body produces de∣formity.
The least deviation, in the pro∣ductions
of the fine arts, from the natural
harmony of the parts, always occasions a ble∣mish.</P>
<P>THERE is another kind of <HI>proportion,</HI> at
least not wholly dependent on utility, which
is preserved in the appearances of things,
when none of the parts are so small, in respect
of one another, and of the whole, as to dis∣appear
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
through their smallness, when we
contemplate the whole; and when none of
them are so large, that, when we fix our
view on them, we cannot distinctly perceive
at the same time their relation to the whole,
and to the other parts. Figures, whose sides
are very numerous, lose a great part of the
beauty, which would arise from this variety,
by the want of proportion between the sides
and the diameter. Works in the <HI>Gothic</HI>
taste, crowded with minute ornaments, fall as
much short of perfect beauty, by their dis∣proportion,
as by their deviation from sim∣plicity.</P>
<P>As nothing gives us greater pleasure, than
what leads us to form a lofty conception of
our own faculties, so nothing is more disa∣greeable,
than what reminds us of their im∣perfection.
On this account it is, that the
want of this kind of proportion disgusts us.
It leads us to entertain a low, and of consequence
ungrateful, opinion of our capacity,
by rendering it impossible to form one entire
conception of the object. The variety of its
parts may amuse us, and keep us from at∣tempting
to comprehend the whole; and
then, especially if it be joined with uniform∣ity,
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
it will yield us some degree of pleasure,
and constitute an inferior and imperfect spe∣cies
of beauty. But still proportion is neces∣sary
for perfecting the beauty, and fully gra∣tifying
a correct and improved taste.</P>
<P>THUS the absence of any one of these in∣gredients,
the want either of uniformity, of
variety, or of proportion, diminishes the beau∣ty
of objects: but where all of them are
wanting, deformity must prevail. Figures
may be desirable or valuable on other ac∣counts;
but without these qualities they can∣not
be beautiful.</P>
<P>UTILITY, or the <HI>fitness</HI> of things for an∣swering
their ends<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">This, which is the principle of a distinct order of beau∣ty, is confounded with uniformity, which is but one ingredient in that of figures, by CROUSAZ; <HI>Traité du Beau,</HI> passim.</NOTE>, constitutes another
species of beauty, distinct from that of figure.
It is of so great importance that, though <HI>con∣venience</HI>
is sometimes in lesser instances sacri∣ficed
to <HI>regularity,</HI> yet a great degree of in∣convenience
generally destroys all the plea∣sure,
which should have arisen from the sym∣metry
and proportion of the parts. It is the
peculiar excellence of nature's works, that, at
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
least in the noblest of them, the most perfect
fitness for their respective ends is united and
rendered consistent with the great elegance of
form<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In plerisque rebus incredibiliter hoc natura est ipsa fa∣bricata,—ut ea, quae maximam utilitatem in se continerent, eadem haberent plurimum vel dignitatis, vel saepe etiam ve∣nustatis. <BIBL>CIC. <HI>de Orat.</HI> lib. iii.</BIBL></NOTE>. We pay a very great regard to
fitness and utility, in establishing the standard
of beauty and proportion in the several kinds.
And though the most perfect art falls infinite∣ly
short of nature, in combining the useful
with the regular; yet none of its productions
is reckoned a master-piece, in which these
excellencies do not meet<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">CIC. ibid.</NOTE>; and to obtain
utility, forms of inferior beauty are, for par∣ticular
purposes, constantly preferred, even
where beauty is far from being neglected.
The cube, not any of the more varied poly∣gons,
is chosen for a pedestal, on account of
its stability. Utility has determined, though
with considerable latitude, the dimensions and
general form of most instruments and works,
without adhering to which, the greatest pro∣fusion
of decoration cannot render them beau∣tiful
in the kind. Unfitness renders orna∣ments
displeasing when wrong applied, which,
in their proper place, might be truly elegant.
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
The splendor of a single figure in history-painting
will but augment its faultiness, if it
takes off the eye from what ought to be the
principal, and obstructs the effect which
should be produced by the whole. In com∣position
the most refined reflections, the most
elaborate descriptions, the warmest pathos
displease; if they break the unity, if they do
not promote, much more if they retard, the
main design, to which all the parts should be
subordinate.</P>
<Q>Sed nunc non erat his locus—</Q>
<P>The impropriety of their position wholly
defaces their intrinsic beauty. In general,
it is from the end and design of works of ge∣nius
that their peculiar rules can be deduced:
this directs the author in the choice, dispo∣sition,
and embellishment of the parts: and by
this the critic must regulate his judgment.
It is from the relation they bear to different
ends, that narration, poetry, and eloquence
are subject to very different laws: and from
the same source is derived the diversity of the
rules belonging to the subordinate branches of
each. Could fitness be dispensed with, a col∣lection
of fine sentiments and figures cloathed
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
in agreeable language, might fully gratify
our taste, however unconnected with one
another.</P>
<P>THAT we may comprehend the nature of
that pleasure which is produced by fitness, it
must be observed, that, whenever we discover
in effects a greater degree of uniformity or
well adapted complication, than could be ex∣pected
from the laws of chance; especially
when we recognize a fitness for answering an
important end; we then infer, not only in∣tention,
but art and skill in the cause: which
implying mental excellence and perfection,
the view of it gives a noble satisfaction; as
on the other hand faultiness of contrivance,
by suggesting imperfect skill and want of ge∣nius,
displeases us greatly. When therefore
we see a work, it leads us by a natural asso∣ciation
to conceive its end; prone to com∣parison,
we examine the propriety of the
parts in relation to this end; if any of them
are prejudicial to it, we are disgusted with
the want of skill, which this imperfection be∣trays.
We dwell in imagination on the in∣conveniences
which must arise from the un∣fitness
of the structure; we form strong ideas
of them, which produce almost the same un∣easy
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
sentiments and passions, as if we actually
experienced them; and by this means often
obliterate all the pleasing impressions, which
the other qualities of the object might have
caused. But when, on examination, the fit∣ness
of all the parts appears, the satisfaction,
with which we think on the skill and inge∣nuity
thus displayed, communicates itself to
the effect so nearly allied to it, so closely con∣nected
with it by causation: and we sympa∣thetically
enter into a strong feeling of the de∣light
which must attend the possession or use
of what is so well designed and executed.</P>
<P>THE beauty of <HI>colours</HI> is entirely distinct
from both the former, and pleases us from
principles wholly different. Colours being
nothing else than various degrees and modi∣fications
of light, some of them are less hurt∣ful
to the organs of sight than others; and
are, on that account, in some instances ap∣proved
as beautiful.</P>
<P>SOME colours again, by their <HI>splendor,</HI> af∣ford
a lively and vigorous sensation, which
gratifies us, by producing a chearful and vi∣vacious
disposition of mind in contemplating
them.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="47"/>
BUT the beauty of colours is, in most in∣stances,
resolvable into <HI>association;</HI> those being
approved, which, either by a natural resem∣blance,
or by custom, or opinion, introduce and
are connected with agreeable ideas of any sort;
and those being disapproved, which have any
way become related to disagreeable ones. The
verdure of the fields is delightful, not only by
being inoffensive to the eye, but chiefly by
its suggesting the pleasant idea of fertility.
Heath in bloom would form a carpet agree∣able
enough to sight, if we could separate
from its appearance the idea of the barren∣ness
of the mountains and wilds it covers. In
dress colours are either beautiful or the con∣trary,
according to the nature of the idea
which they lead us to form of the station, sen∣timents,
and character of the wearer.</P>
<P>IN some cases, a particular dress, in con∣sequence
of established manners, suggests to
the generality nearly the same idea. Where∣ever
this <HI>general</HI> connection takes place, it
forms a kind of standard in dress, for persons
in certain stations or professions. We come to
perceive a propriety in conforming to it; and
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
we are displeased with the indecency of devi∣ating
remarkably from it.</P>
<P>WHEN the idea suggested by dress is dif∣ferent
in different persons, so also is the relish
for the colour; what suggests to one a live∣liness
and vivacity of turn, gives another the
idea of gaudiness and levity; the same dress
may convey to some the idea of gravity and
sedateness, to others that of dullness and au∣sterity.</P>
<P>COLOURS, as applied in painting, come un∣der
consideration here only in respect of their
delicacy or vivacity; which, however esti∣mable,
are not yet of so great importance, as
the power they have of representing grandeur
or beauty of figure, or of exhibiting solid bo∣dies,
by such an artful and ingenious imita∣tion,
as itself delights us, in a way hereafter
to be explained.</P>
<P>THE beauty of colours may be heightened
by the addition of <HI>variety,</HI> a circumstance
which bestows some charms on the most ir∣regular
mixture of them, provided they be of
themselves agreeable, especially if they be so
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
disposed as to set off to advantage the separate
brightness or beauty of each other.</P>
<P>THERE is perhaps no term used in a looser
sense than beauty, which is applied to almost
every thing that pleases us. Though this
usage is doubtless too indefinite, we may,
without a faulty deviation from precision, ap∣ply
this epithet to every pleasure which is
conveyed by the eye, and which has not got
a proper and peculiar name; to the pleasure
we receive, either when an object of sight
suggests pleasant ideas of other senses; or when
the ideas suggested are agreeable ones form∣ed
from the sensations of sight; or when
both these circumstances concur. In all
these cases, beauty is, at least in part, resolva∣ble
into association.</P>
<P>THE first method of effecting beauty, we
have already seen exemplified in colours,
which are themselves objects of sight introdu∣cing
pleasant ideas not derived from sight.
Thus also the structure of a human face often
indicates good mental dispositions, which are
not only themselves approved as virtuous, but
by being so, diffuse a beauty over the coun∣tenance
in which they are imprinted: but
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
bad affections, expressed in the look, throw
deformity upon the finest features.</P>
<P>IN the second way is produced the only
beauty of thought or sentiment, which comes
properly under the present head; that beauty
which arises, when the subject described is
agreeable to sight, as light, flowers, fields,
meadows, groves; or when it is illustrated by
images from things that are so agreeable.
This is one great part of the beauty of pasto∣ral;
and enters in some degree into every
kind of poetry<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The other qualities which render sentiments beautiful or agreeable, as metaphor, fable, antithesis morality, eleva∣tion, &amp;c. belong to other classes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO the third cause, or the union of both
the former, imitations of <HI>beautiful</HI> originals,
by figure and colour, owe their beauty. It
is observable that the arts which use these in∣struments
have greater advantages for imitat∣ing
beauty than sublimity. This they can
represent, as we have seen, only by suggesting
<HI>ideas</HI> of grand objects; but the copies would
not, if considered as originals, be grand;
since they are almost ever destitute of magni∣tude,
its most essential requisite, But imita∣tions
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
of beautiful originals, independent of
their resemblance to these, are beautiful;
since they cannot otherways exhibit their
beauties to the thought, than by themselves
possessing them in some degree: and often
they possess them as perfectly as their arche∣types.
A statue has the same regularity and
proportion as its original. A painting may
equal the object it represents, not only in
symmetry and propriety, but in colour.</P>
<P>THE classes of beauty, which we have
been explaining, are distinct in their princi∣ples,
though by reason of the similitude of
their feeling, they are reduced to the same
genus. But they are often in things variously
united, and by their union they render our
satisfaction more intense. In a fine face all
the principles of beauty are combined. To
an exact symmetry and regular proportion of
varied features, and parts nicely adapted to
their several purposes, is superadded complex∣ion,
composed of white and red, colours beau∣tiful
in themselves rendered still more so by
the artful manner in which they are disposed,
and by their indicating health and freshness;
and the grace of the whole is heightened by
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
a quick expressiveness of aspect, which forces
us instantaneously to perceive acuteness, saga∣city,
sedateness, sweetness, or the like amiable
qualities, in the mind which animates the ele∣gant
form; while the approbation attending
this perception is reflected back upon the
face which gave occasion to it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the sense or taste of imitation.</HEAD>
<P>EXACTNESS and liveliness of imita∣tion
supply us with another pleasure
of taste, which, as it has no peculiar name, is
commonly expressed by that of beauty; and
is by some termed relative or secondary, to
distinguish it from the kinds above explained,
which are called absolute or primary<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See HUTCHESON'S Enquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue. <BIBL>Treat. I. Sect. iv.</BIBL></NOTE>.
We have a natural sense, which is highly
gratified by a designed resemblance, though
there be nothing agreeable in the original.
Similitude is a very powerful principle of asso∣ciation,
which, by continually connecting
the ideas in which it is found, and leading
our thoughts from one of them to the other,
produces in mankind a strong tendency to
comparison. As comparison implies in the
very act a gentle exertion of the mind, it is
on that account agreeable. As a farther ener∣gy
is requisite for discovering the original by
the copy; and as this discovery produces a
grateful consciousness of our own discern∣ment
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
and sagacity, and includes the pleasant
feeling of success; the recognizing resem∣blance,
in consequence of comparison, aug∣ments
our pleasure<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. And when the imi∣tation
is intended, our admiration of the skill
and ingenuity of the artist diffuses itself over
the effect from which that skill is inferred,
and compleats the delight which the work
inspires.</P>
<P>HENCE the rapture with which a connoisseur
beholds the capital performances of the emi∣nent
masters in painting or sculpture. Hence
the main excellence of poetical or eloquent
descriptions; the characteristical perfection
of which arises from the author's judiciously
selecting the most essential and striking qua∣lities
of his subject, and combining them in∣to
such a picture as quickly revives in the
reader, and strongly impresses on his mind
a lively idea of the original. The fundamen∣talbeauty
of metaphor and allegory lies in their
insinuating the analogies of things; that of simi∣litude
and comparison in their more explicitly
proposing these analogies. By this they com∣municate
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
fineness to a sentiment. Most of
the figures and tropes of eloquence derive
their grace from their being so employed, as
to correspond with the natural expressions or
objects of those passions and sentiments, which
actuate the orator, or which he would inspire
into his audience. Improbability, which is
a want of resemblance to natural things, al∣ways
renders a fable or story less entertaining;
and if the improbability be very great, or ex∣tend
to the material parts, it often makes it
wholly nauseous.</P>
<P>WHEN excellent originals are imitated, the
copies derive their charms, not merely from
exactness of imitation, but also from the ex∣cellence
which they represent; and the grati∣fication
which these copies afford may almost
as properly be ascribed to beauty or sublimity
as to imitation. As the beauty here is com∣plicated
in it's principles, it will of consequence
be also compounded in its effect, and will ra∣vish
the mind much more than either of its con∣stituents
alone. An <HI>Hercules,</HI> exhibiting pro∣portion,
strength, and fortitude in perfection,
must be a finerstatue than the exactest imitation
of a <HI>Thersites or Silenus.</HI> The works of <HI>Polygno∣tus,</HI>
which represented beautiful objects, were
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>
doubtless more delightful than the pictures of
<HI>Dionysius</HI> or <HI>Pauson,</HI> however skillfully they
might represent ordinary or faulty objects<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.
The ancient <HI>Greek,</HI> or the modern <HI>Italian</HI>
painters will always be preferable to the <HI>Fle∣mish,</HI>
who, though they imitate <HI>well,</HI> do not
make a judicious <HI>choice</HI> of such beauties of na∣ture
as deserve to be imitated<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">In this particular the antient artists were so careful, that they were not content with imitating the most perfect <HI>individuals,</HI> they could meet with; but, collecting the perfec∣tions of many, they formed one <HI>general</HI> idea more complete, than could be drawn from any single real existence. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. The <HI>Margites</HI>
of <HI>Homer</HI> could not have given us so high en∣tertainment
as we receive from the <HI>Iliad.</HI> A
comparison, however nicely suited to the subject,
will please still more, if it is taken from what
conveys no ideas, but such as are noble and
agreeable: and indeed by suggesting such as
are strongly the reverse, it will be suffi∣cient
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
to turn the most magnificent subject
into ridicule.</P>
<P>BUT still the force of imitation is most
conspicuous, when no other principles con∣cur
to heighten its effect: for as it is then
pure and unmixed, we cannot question,
that the whole pleasure of the sentiment pro∣duced
is owing to it alone. Its power is in∣deed
so great, that it not only, without the
assistance of other principles, produces a con∣siderable
degree of pleasure; but often re∣commends
and gains the preference to
imperfect or faulty originals; and makes
things grateful when reflected by it, which
would be very ungrateful, if viewed directly.
The rudest rocks and mountains; the ob∣jects
that in nature are most deformed; even
disease and pain, acquire beauty when skill∣fully
imitated in painting<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. It is chiefly
by copying imperfections and absurdities that
mimicry and humour please. A perfect
imitation of characters morally evil, can make
us dwell with pleasure on them, notwithstand∣ing
the uneasy sentiments of disapprobation
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
and abhorrence which they excite. The
character of <HI>Iago</HI> is detestable, but we ad∣mire
<HI>Shakespear's</HI> representation of it. Nay
imperfect and mixt characters are, in all
kinds of writing, preferred to faultless ones,
as being juster copies of real nature. The
pleasant sensation resulting from the imita∣tion
is so intense, that it overpowers and con∣verts
into delight even the <HI>uneasy</HI> impressions,
which spring from the objects imitated.
There can be no stronger proof of the force
of imitation in conferring on its effects the
power of pleasing, than its rendering those
passions agreeable, when excited by it, which,
when produced in the natural way, are pure
and unmixt pain. Suspense, anxiety, terror,
when produced in Tragedy, by imitation of
their objects and causes, and infused by sym∣pathy,
afford not only a more serious, but a
much intenser and nobler satisfaction, than
all the laughter and joy, which farce or co∣medy
can inspire, When thus secondarily
produced, they agitate and employ the mind,
and rouse and give scope to its greatest activi∣ty;
while at the same time our implicit
knowledge that the occasion is remote or fic∣titious,
enables the pleasure of imitation to
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>
relieve the pure torment, which would at∣tend
their primary operation.</P>
<P>FROM what has been said, it is obvious
that the pleasure of imitation arises from a
combination of causes. Besides the act of
comparison, which is the same in all instan∣ces,
the exactness of the resemblance, our
discovery of it, and the art we conceive ne∣cessary
for producing it, concur to make up
our gratification.</P>
<P>EXACTNESS of resemblance is scarce farther
approved, than as it evidences skill and ena∣bles
us to to discover the original. <HI>Ca∣ravaggio</HI>
is censurable for too closely follow∣ing
the life, as well as <HI>Gioseppino</HI> for wanton∣ly
deviating from it into fantastical extrava∣gances.
Among the antient statuaries like∣wise,
<HI>Demetrius</HI> is censured for being too
studious of likeness, and sacrificing beauty to
it; and is on this account reckoned inferior
to <HI>Lysippus</HI> and <HI>Praxiteles,</HI> who, at the same
time that they excelled in producing like∣ness,
carried it no farther than was consistent
with beauty<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ad veritatem <HI>Lysippum</HI> et <HI>Praxitelem</HI> accessisse optime affirmant. Nam <HI>Demetrius</HI> tanquam nimius in ea reprehen∣ditur, et <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit similitudinis quam pulchritudinis amantior. <BIBL><HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int. Instit. Orat.</HI> lib. xii. cap. 10.</BIBL></NOTE>. Exactness of resemblance may
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>
be carried so far in any work of genius, as
to degenerate into disagreeable servility; and
is easily dispensed with, when the deviation
from similitude appears to be the result of su∣perior
art. However, that instrument of imi∣tation
is doubtless the most perfect, which is
capable of producing the most perfect likeness.
Among the fine arts, this preeminence, in
most subjects, belongs to sculpture; and
more to painting, in subjects perfectly adapted
to it, than to poetry.</P>
<P>BUT even the imperfection of the instru∣ment
of imitation may sometimes add merit
to the effect. Though it renders the resem∣blance
less accurate, this very circumstance
enhances the pleasure, by producing a con∣sciousness
of greater sagacity in discovering
the original; at the same time that the pro∣duction
of likeness with unapt materials, im∣plying
greater difficulty, gives rise to an high∣er
approbation of the ingenuity of the artist.
In this respect painting is more artificial than
statuary. For that reason a fine picture will
inspire full as great pleasure as a statue. Its
representing solid bodies, only by the dispo∣sition
of light and shade, tho' itself a plane, is a
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
proof of the highest skill. And could a per∣son
be formed to delicacy of taste, and yet
kept from seeing a picture till he were adult;
it is scarce conceivable what rapture he should
feel, when he first discovered it to be but a
plane variously shaded, after having firmly
believed, that, like the objects he had been
accustomed to, it had itself the prominences
and cavities which it represents<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hence in the celebrated contest between a painter and a statuary, concerning the merit of their arts▪ both argued from real principles of excellence; the statuary pleading the per∣fection of resemblance in his art; the painter the superior in∣genuity which his discovered. The blind man gave the pre∣ference to the latter. The controversy cannot be determined, till it is previously fixed, which principle is, on the whole, eligible.</NOTE>. And
as every difficulty of execution heightens our
idea of the skill by which it is surmounted,
not only the <HI>importance</HI> of the work, but also the
<HI>difficulty</HI> of representing passion and character by
figure and colour, increase the beauty of histo∣ry-painting.
In this view poetry, imitating by
instituted symbols, noways resembling things,
is on most subjects more imperfectly mimetic
than the other arts: but this imperfection gives
it a kind of merit, as that art is able notwith∣standing
to suggest very lively ideas of its ob∣jects.
But what constitutes its unquestionable
<PB N="58" REF="62"/>
superiority to all its sister arts, is its peculiar
and unrivaled power of imitating the noblest
and most important of all subjects, the calmest
sentiments of the heart, and human charac∣ters
displayed in a long series of conduct. For
in determining the comparative merit of the
imitative arts, we must not only estimate the
excellencies of the <HI>instruments</HI> or <HI>manners</HI> of
imitation, which they respectively claim; but
also the moment of what they imitate, the
value of the <HI>ends</HI> to which they are adapt∣ed<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">All this must be taken under consideration, in order to explain the nature of any one of the fine arts: and it is only after the nature of each has been unfolded that we can judge of their relative importance. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the sense or taste of harmony.</HEAD>
<P>THE sense of harmony, which confers
a kind of beauty upon sound, not
only is conversant in all the arts which employ
language, but itself lays the sole foundation
of the art of music. By it the ear derives
from its objects a pleasure similar to what the
eye receives from forms. This pleasure is
resolvable into the agreeableness of <HI>single</HI>
sounds, and into the charms and energy of a
skillful <HI>complication</HI> of them.</P>
<P>SINGLE sounds are either loud or low,
acute or grave, slender or full, even or bro∣ken.
To these qualities attention must be
paid, if we would please the ear. If sounds
are too <HI>low,</HI> they do not strike with force
enough to gratify: if too <HI>loud,</HI> they confound
us. Great <HI>acuteness</HI> lacerates the organ: and
an excess of <HI>gravity</HI> renders the impression
too dull and spiritless to please. <HI>Exility</HI> hin∣ders
sounds from sufficiently filling the ear,
and thence is attended with a perception of
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
meanness and futility: but <HI>full</HI> and swelling
notes, by occupying its whole expansion, ac∣quire
grandeur and inspire delight. <HI>Broken</HI>
sounds grate the ear, by their harsh inequa∣lities:
<HI>smoothness</HI> and evenness is necessary to
prevent their being disagreeable.</P>
<P>HARMONY presupposes the agreeableness
of the separate notes, but it is produced only
by a <HI>combination</HI> of sounds. The different
compositions of articulate sounds, added to
the separate qualities of each, render some
words harmonious, others harsh. Some ar∣ticulate
sounds do not easily concur; the
transition from one configuration of the or∣gans
of speech to the other, is difficult and
uneasy; and the hearer is led by a delicate
sympathy with the speaker, to feel this pain
and labour. It is the frequency of such com∣binations,
that prevents euphony in any
tongue; and renders some languages less
smooth and harmonious than others. In sen∣tences,
periods, and discourses, the harmony
or the asperity of style arises from the repe∣tition
of sounds and combinations separately
agreeable or disagreeable: and the harmony
is rendered more delightful, by the <HI>variety</HI>
which the length of the composition admits.
<PB N="61" REF="65"/>
The importance of variety we shall acknow∣ledge,
if we but reflect how tiresome same∣ness
of cadence is. The superior harmony
of Poetry is produced by the greater facility
of its combinations, joined to a considerable
degree of <HI>uniformity,</HI> and a regular <HI>proportion</HI>
in time; the proper method of obtaining
which, in every language, determines its pros∣ody:
and the variety of the means to be
employed for this end in different languages
introduces a similar variety in the genius and
measure of their verse.</P>
<P>WHENEVER our pleasure arises from a suc∣cession
of sounds, it is a perception of a com∣plicated
nature; made up of a <HI>sensation</HI> of the
present sound or note, and an <HI>idea</HI> or remem∣brance
of the foregoing, which by their mixture
and concurrence, produce such a mysterious de∣light,
as neither could have produced alone.
And it is often heightened by an <HI>anticipation</HI>
of the succeeding notes. Hence it proceeds
in part, that we are in general best pleased
with pieces of music, which we are acquaint∣ed
with: our understanding them more tho∣roughly
counter balances the power of novelty.
Hence too it is, that we often acquire in time
<PB N="62" REF="66"/>
a fondness for what at first we did not highly
relish; the anticipation, which repetition
enables us to make of the succeeding note,
supplying the defect in the sensation of the
present, and the idea of the past sound when
disunited from it, cementing them as it
were, and making them run into one another
without difficulty or harshness. Sense, Me∣mory,
and Imagination are thus conjunctively
employed, in exhibiting to the interior organ
a succession of sounds, which properly dispo∣sed,
especially in music, fill us with exquisite
delight.</P>
<P>IT is observable that the proper and pleas∣ing
disposition of sounds in <HI>melody</HI> bears a great
resemblance, in its principles, to that arrange∣ment
of parts, which constitutes the beauty of
forms. It is a succession of notes, bearing to
one another a regular <HI>proportion</HI> in time;
so <HI>varied</HI> in their lengths and intervals<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">As the great force of <HI>proportion</HI> in time is evident from the universal attention, that is paid to it in Music of every kind; so the influence of <HI>variety</HI> of time appears particularly in the Drum, the whole Music of which is owing to it alone.</NOTE>,
as to relieve satiety and tediousness; and at
the same time so far <HI>uniform,</HI> that the transi∣tions
<PB N="63" REF="67"/>
are all in themselves agreeable, such as
are taken in by the ear with ease, and are sub∣ordinate
to the key which governs the whole.</P>
<P>THE same principles are not less obvious in
<HI>harmony;</HI> the superior delight of which springs
from no other cause, but its possessing some
of these qualities in greater perfection. The
<HI>uniformity</HI> is preserved almost undiminished;
the different parts being so combined, that no
dissonance is occasioned by their multiplicity;
but the concordant notes, melted into one ano∣ther,
strike the ear together without confu∣sion
or distraction. With this simplicity, an
immense <HI>variety</HI> is made consistent; each se∣parate
part being a distinct series of artfully
varied sounds; the melody of all the parts
being enjoyed at once: the vibrations of the
concords coinciding not always, but at regu∣lar
periods; the diversity of the concords and
their successions producing a great diversity of
harmonies; and the judicious intermixture
of discords preventing the sense from being
cloyed with symphony too long continued.
At the same time, the <HI>proportion</HI> is rendered
more conspicuous and artful, by its being
preserved in all the parts; and a new kind
<PB N="64" REF="68"/>
of it is introduced by their comparative
strength. So great is the efficacy of these
principles, that they alone produce very high
pleasure, though no passion is excited by the
music.</P>
<P>BUT still the chief excellence of Music lies
in its <HI>expression.</HI> By this quality, music is ap∣plied
to a determinate subject: by this it ac∣quires
a fitness, becomes adapted to an end,
and agitates the soul with whatever passion
the artist chooses<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hence different kinds of music may, in a consistence with their being all agreeable, answer different and even oppo∣site purposes. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. Its power to operate
on the passions is its most important virtue.
And indeed as all sensations and emotions re∣sembling
in their feeling, tend to introduce
each other into the mind; music, producing
by its harmony a pleasant disposition of soul,
renders us peculiarly prone to every agreeable
affection. But it makes use too of other in∣struments.
By the natural fitness of sound
for accomplishing an imitation of, or associa∣tion
<PB N="65" REF="69"/>
with their objects and natural expres∣sions,
it infuses into the breast passions corre∣spondent;
settles into calm serenity, melts in∣to
tenderness or pity, sinks into sorrow, sooths
into melancholy, agitates with terror, elevates
with joy, excites to courage, or enraptures
with devotion; and thus inexpressibly delights
the soul.</P>

JARRING and incongruous circumstances
meeting in the same subject form an absur∣dity,
with which we are apt to be diverted.
Such are cowardice in a boaster; ignorance
in a man of what he ought or pretends to
know; dignity of any kind blended with
meanness; sentiments or style in composition
unsuitable to the subject. We are disposed
to combine the parts of things into a whole,
and to bestow upon them unity and intimate
relation; we expect that they should be all
consistent, suitable, and of a piece; and when
we find them otherways, we pronounce them
ridiculous and absurd.</P>
<P>WE compare in this light not only the
qualities of the same subject, but also of sub∣jects
resembling or otherways nearly connec∣ted;
and their contrariety affects us with a
similar sensation. An opposition of charac∣ters
and behaviour in different persons, espe∣cially
of the same family or profession, often
forms a diverting contrast. A passion intense
in its feeling, excited by a trifling cause,
moves our laughter. A glaring dispropor∣tion
betwixt the means and the end, when
the means are either unequal to its attain∣ment,
<PB N="68" REF="72"/>
or too laborious and expensive for its
importance, is on the same principle ridicu∣lous.</P>
<P>So excursive is the human fancy, that it
continually leads us to compare things the
most dissimilar; and as on the former com∣parisons
the appearance of incongruity, so on
this the discovery of unlooked for likenesses,
analogies, and relations, proves a source of
pleasure and amusement. Inferior animals
provoke our mirth, whenever they mimic
the actions or sagacity of human creatures.</P>
<P>OBJECTS, conceived to be in any of these
ways incongruous, always gratify the sense of
ridicule: but they may excite at the same
time a more important feeling, which, by
occupying the mind prevents our attending
to the incongruity, or extinguishes the senti∣ment
thence resulting, as soon as it begins to
rise. Enormous vice, though of all things
the most incongruous to the natural system
of our minds, is never esteemed ridiculous<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Nec insignis improbitas, et scelere juncta, nec rursus mi∣seria insignis agitata ridetur: facinorosos majore quadam vi, quam ridicuti, vulnerari volunt; miseros illudi nolunt, nisi se forte jactant. <BIBL>CIC. <HI>de Orat.</HI> lib. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>.

<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the sense or taste of virtue.</HEAD>
<P>THE moral sense is not only itself a
taste of a superior order, by which in
characters and conduct we distinguish be∣tween
the right and the wrong, the excel∣lent
and the faulty; but it also spreads its
influence over all the most considerable works
of art and genius. It is never unregarded in
serious performances, and it enters even into
the most ludicrous. It claims a <HI>joint autho∣rity</HI>
with the other principles of Taste; it
requires an attachment to morality in the
epos and the drama, and it pronounces the
quickest flights of wit, without it, phrensy
and distraction. Something moral has in∣sinuated
itself, not only into the serious designs
of <HI>Raphael,</HI> but also into the humourous re∣presentations
of <HI>Hogarth.</HI></P>
<P>NAY our moral sense claims authority <HI>su∣perior</HI>
to all the rest. It renders morality
the chief requisite; and where this is in any
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>
degree violated, no other qualities can attone
for the transgression. Particular beauties
may be approved, but the work is, on the
whole, condemned.</P>
<P>How great a part of the sentiments pro∣duced
by works of genius arises from the
exertion of this sense, approving or condemn∣ing,
is too obvious to require our dwelling on
it. The noblest and most delightful subjects
of imitation are affections, characters, and
actions: and their peculiar merit arises almost
entirely from their continually drawing out
and employing the moral faculty. By its
approbation, more effectually than by any
other means, we become interested for some of
the persons represented, and sympathise with
every change in their condition. It fills us with
joyful approbation of the virtuouscharacter, and
with abhorrence, not ungrateful when thus ex∣cited,
of the vicious. When prosperity and suc∣cess
attend the former, we feel his good desert,
we rejoice to find it meet its due reward, we
are composed into delightful serenity, compla∣cence
and affiance in righteous providence:
when he is sunk into disappointment and ad∣versity,
we are sensible that he deserved it
not, and taste the pleasurable pain of com∣passion
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
for his sufferings, and virtuous re∣sentment
against the authors of them. When
the vicious man is prosperous, we glow with
indignation, we feel a kind of melancholy de∣spondence:
when he suffers, we become
sensible to the danger of vice, to the terrors
of guilt; we allow his ill desert, but mix pity
with our blame. We are thus agitated by
those most important passions; the infusion
of which constitutes the highest entertainment
that works of taste can give.</P>
<P>BUT what extensive influence the moral
sense has on taste of every kind, it will be
unnecessary particularly to describe, if we
only recollect the various perceptions which
it conveys. To it belongs our perception of
the fairness, beauty, and loveliness of vir∣tue,
of the ugliness, deformity, and hateful∣ness
of vice, produced by the native qualities
of each considered simply. From it is deri∣ved
our perception of decency, fitness, and
congruity in the former; of incongruity, inde∣cency
and unfitness in the latter; which arises
from implicit comparison of them, with the
structure and constitution of the mind. By
it we perceive that virtue is obligatory, right,
and due; and that vice is undue, unlawful,
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
and wrong: the perception springs from the
supremacy of our approving and disapproving
faculty, as our internal governour prescribing
a law of life. The same sense conveys a per∣ception
of merit and good desert in virtue, of
demerit and ill desert in vice; a perception,
which never fails to be excited, when we
think at once of moral and natural good or
evil. From this variety of sensations arise
all the reflex passions which regard good or
bad men as their objects. How much these
sentiments and affections enter into the per∣ceptions
of taste, the least reflection will in∣form
us.</P>
<P>THUS much may suffice for an Analysis
of taste into those simple powers of human
nature, which are its principles. There are
qualities in things, determinate and stable,
independent of humour or caprice, that are
fit to operate on mental principles, common
to all men, and, by operating on them, are
naturally productive of the sentiments of taste
in all its forms. If, in any particular in∣stance,
they prove ineffectual, it is to be
ascribed to some weakness or disorder in the
person, who remains unmoved, when these
qualities are exhibited to his view. Men
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
are, with <HI>few</HI> exceptions, affected by the
qualities, we have investigated: but these
qualities themselves are, without <HI>any</HI> excep∣tion,
the constituents of excellence or faulti∣ness
in the several kinds. What is necessary
for perceiving them with perfect relish, we
shall next examine.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the union of the internal senses, and the assis∣tance
they receive from delicacy of passion.</HEAD>
<P>ANY <HI>one</HI> of the internal senses, existing
in vigor and perfection, forms a par∣ticular
branch of taste, and enables a man to
judge in some one subject of art or genius:
but <HI>all</HI> of them must at once be vigorous, in
order to constitute Taste in its just extent.
This <HI>union</HI> is necessary, not only for giving it
a proper compass, but also for perfecting each
of its exertions.</P>
<P>OUR sentiments and emotions receive an
immense addition of strength from their reci∣procal
influence on one another. Concomi∣tant
emotions, related by their feeling, their
<PB N="80" REF="84"/>
direction, or their objects, or even without
any relation existing in the mind together,
run into one, and by their mixture produce
an intense sensation. Hence different grati∣fications,
either of the same or diverse senses,
occurring to the mind at once, give it a com∣plicated
joy. The stillness and serenity of a
summer morning, the sweet fragrance of
flowers, the music of birds, and a thousand
other agreeable circumstances are even com∣monly
observed to bestow extraordinary force
on the grandeur or beauty of rural scenes.</P>
<P>THO' each object of taste has some <HI>lead∣ing</HI>
character by which it is peculiarly fitted
to produce one <HI>principal</HI> sensation, it may at
the same time, by its <HI>subordinate</HI> qualities pro∣duce
<HI>attendant</HI> feelings, which will render
the principal one higher and more intense, by
their conspiring with it. But if the princi∣ples
of Taste, adapted to these, are weak or
deficient, we not only lose entirely <HI>some</HI> of
the pleasures, which the object might con∣vey;
but cannot even enjoy <HI>any</HI> of them with
perfect relish, as we are insensible to the
heightenings, which each receives from its
connection with the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="85"/>
NONE of our sensations is more able to sup∣port
itself, without foreign aid, than that of
grandeur; of which a great critic reckons it a
necessary character, that it please still more
the oftener it is examined<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. Yet every
one is sensible how much more intense it is ren∣dered
by novelty; how weakly the sublimest
objects often strike us, when by long custom
they have become familiar. The sublimity
of the heavens could not fail to enrapture one
unaccustomed to the glorious spectacle. Tho'
the sentiment of sublimity fills, and almost
exceeds the capacity of the mind, we can yet
receive along with it other pleasurable feel∣ings.
which will increase it by their conjunc∣tion.
The most elevating objects in nature
may be rendered more delightful by their
beauty and utility. The most extensive power
may be rendered more sublime, by its being
exercised in such a manner as to produce
moral approbation. <HI>Virgil</HI> gives a sublime
idea of the <HI>Romans,</HI> when he represents them
<PB N="82" REF="86"/>
as destined for Empire universal, as prescri∣bing
laws at pleasure, and forcing into sub∣jection
the most haughty opposers. But he
artfully renders it more sublime, by insinua∣ting
that they exercised their power in cle∣mency
to willing subjects<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><L>Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento.</L>
<L>Hae tibi erunt artes; pacisque imponere morem,</L>
<L><HI>Parcere subjectis,</HI> et debellare superbos.</L>
<BIBL>AEN. vi. ver. 847.</BIBL></NOTE> This pro∣cures
our moral approbation, and augments
the sentiment of grandeur, which it accom∣panies.
In architecture, the separate plea∣sures,
arising from the beauty, proportion, fit∣ness,
and ornaments of the parts, heighten
the sublime. In painting the sublime is ge∣nerally
attended by the graceful.</P>
<P>POETRY is a complication of beauties, re∣flecting
by their union additional lustre on one
another. The sublime, the new, the ele∣gant,
the natural, the virtuous, are often
blended in the imitation; brighten'd by the
power of fiction, and the richest variety of
imagery; and rendered more delightful by
the harmony of numbers. When Poetry is
set to well adapted music, both gain <HI>new</HI>
power by their alliance. The music, by
<PB N="83" REF="87"/>
exciting the requisite affections, puts the
mind in a disposition to conceive ideas suited
to them with peculiar facility, vivacity, and
pleasure. These ideas the Poet raises: and
they, in their turn, enliven the affections,
and preserve them from languishing or ex∣piring,
by rendering their objects more de∣terminate.
But in order to experience this
compound pleasure, both a musical ear and
a poetic taste are requisite: the want of
either extinguishes one part of the delight,
and very much diminishes the other.</P>
<P>THE degree of force with which objects
strike us, has a great dependence on the <HI>pre∣vailing</HI>
disposition of the mind. Things of∣ten
affect us deeply, when we are in an hu∣mour
suited to them, tho' at another time
they would make small impression. The smal∣lest
injury may produce fury in a person na∣turally
passionate, or by accident chagrined.
When the temper of the mind is such, as
gives it an habitual turn to one kind of sen∣timents
and affections, it enters into them,
whenever they occur, with extraordinary spi∣rit.
As they fall in with its predominant
bent, no force is required to adapt it to the
perception of them; it spontaneously, and
<PB N="84" REF="88"/>
even eagerly embraces them, as perfectly con∣formable
to its frame.</P>
<P>Now as all the objects of the same inter∣nal
sense, however various, have their com∣mon
qualities,; so all these senses are analo∣gous
in their principles and feeling. The
same turn of mind is, on this account, con∣gruous
to them all. The prevalence and ex∣ercise,
of any one of them disposes and at∣tunes
the mind to all the rest. And this pre∣vious
disposition to them bestows strength
and vigour on all their exertions. In fact,
the kindred powers of taste are seldom disu∣nited.
Where all of them have considerable
vigour, one may be, in comparison with the
rest, predominant; either by the natural con∣struction
of the mind, or by peculiar culture.
But where one of them is remarkably dull,
or altogether wanting, the others scarce ever
appear in full perfection.</P>
<P>THE union of these powers has a farther
influence in forming taste, as that union opens
a new field, in which taste may exercise it∣self
and gather flowers to adorn the native
beauty of its objects. As the fine arts are
truly sisters, derived from the same common
<PB N="85" REF="89"/>
parent <HI>Nature,</HI> they bear to one another, and
to their original, various similitudes, relations,
and analogies<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Est etiam illa Platonis vera—vox, Omnem doctrinam harum ingenuarum et humanarum artium, uno quodam socie∣tatis vinculo contineri.—Mirus quidam omnium quasi con∣sensus doctrinarum, concentusque reperitur. <BIBL>CIC. <HI>de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rat.</HI> lib. iii.</BIBL></NOTE> These one, who possesses
all the internal senses vigorous, and has em∣ployed
them all about their various objects,
is able to trace out. They have charmed
every genuine critic; and every reader of
taste is delighted with the metaphors and
comparisons, which are founded on the per∣ception
of them. In observing them we
find a noble and exquisite entertainment.
They continually occur to an extensive taste;
and, mingling with the more immediate and
confined gratification of each power of ima∣gination,
increase its delightfulness. As one
<HI>science,</HI> by supplying illustrations, makes an∣other
better <HI>understood;</HI> so one <HI>art,</HI> by throw∣ing
lustre on another, makes it more exqui∣fitely
<HI>relished.</HI> This enlargement of taste,
places one as it were upon an eminence, and
not only enables him to take in a wider pros∣pect;
but also improves all the parts of it, by
comparing or contrasting them together.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="90"/>
IN all these ways our interior senses, mere∣ly
by their union, tend to form and perfect
Taste.</P>
<P>WE may here take occasion to mention a
principle, distinct from all the internal sen∣ses,
from which taste will, in many instances,
receive assistance. It is such a <HI>sensibility of
heart,</HI> as fits a man for being easily moved,
and for readily catching, as by infection, any
passion, that a work is fitted to excite. The
fouls of men are far from being alike sus∣ceptible
of impressions of this kind. A
hard hearted man can be a spectator of very
great distress, without feeling any emotion:
A man of a cruel temper has a malignant
joy in producing misery. On the other
hand, many are composed of so delicate ma∣terials,
that the smallest uneasiness of their
fellow creatures excites their pity. A simi∣lar
variety may be observed, in respect of the
other passions. Persons of the former cast
will be little affected by the most moving
tragedy; those of the latter turn will be in∣terested
by a very indifferent one. A per∣formance,
which can insuse the keenest
passions into the breast of an <HI>Italian,</HI> will af∣fect
<PB N="87" REF="91"/>
a <HI>Frenchman</HI> very little, and leave an
<HI>Englishman</HI> perfectly unconcerned. We are
apt to be astonished, when we read of the
prodigious force, with which eloquence
wrought upon the delicate spirits of the <HI>Athe∣nians,</HI>
and feel so little of any thing analo∣gous
to it, that nothing but the most unex∣ceptionable
evidence could make it credible.
This diversity in the formation of the heart
will produce a considerable diversity in the
sentiments, which men receive from works
of taste, and in the judgment, which they
form concerning them.</P>
<P>A VERY great part of the merit of most
works of genius arises from their fitness to
agitate the heart with a variety of passions.
In the most excellent music, the agreeable∣ness
of the melody, and the richness of the
harmony, are only subservient to the expres∣sion.
It is so much the business of painting
and poetry to affect us, by infusing suitable
passions, that a very ingenious critic<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The ABBE DU BOS. <HI>See Reflex. Critiq, sur la poësie &amp; sur la peinture,</HI> passim.</NOTE> has
mistaken it for the <HI>only</HI> business of these arts.
Some kinds of poetry are addressed princi∣pally
to the powers of imagination, and attain
<PB N="88" REF="92"/>
their ultimate end, by exhibiting pictures
of such objects as gratify our internal senses.
Such particularly is descriptive poetry. But
even this kind will soon grow languid and
unentertaining, if it does not support itself, by
introducing subjects of an affecting nature.
In dramatic poetry, and in eloquence, the
ultimate end is to affect; whatever only
pleases the internal senses is subordinate to
this end, and becomes faulty, if it be not con∣ducive
to it▪</P>
<P>SINCE, therefore, the pathetic is a quality
of so great moment in works of taste, a man,
who is destitute of sensibility of heart, must
be a very imperfect judge of them. He is a
stranger to those feelings, which are of greatest
importance to direct his judgment. If a person
possessed all the internal senses in perfection,
without delicacy of passion, he could estimate
the principal works of genius, only by their
inferior qualities. In a tragedy, he might
perceive whether descriptions of natural ob∣jects
are beautiful or sublime, whether the
characters are natural and well supported,
whether the sentiments are just and noble;
he might examine, with coldness and indif∣ference,
the beauties and the faults of the
<PB N="89" REF="93"/>
composition: but whether it has accomplish∣ed
its main end, whether the fable is fit to
produce pity and terror in the spectators, he
must be totally at a loss to determine. In a

<P>DELICACY of passion must be united with
vigorous internal senses, in order to give taste
its just extent. Where this union takes
place, works of genius produce their full ef∣fect;
and inspire a complicated pleasure. A
man receives adequate perceptions of all their
qualities, and, by this, means, has it in his
power to allow each its proper weight in de∣termining
his judgment concerning the me∣rit
of the whole. Delicacy of passion may
interest a person so much, that he cannot for
some time examine a performance with cri∣tical
exactness; but it gives him exquisite
delight in the mean time, and enables him
to pass a just sentence at last.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the influence of Judgment upon
Taste.</HEAD>
<P>THE compleatest <HI>union</HI> of the internal
<HI>senses,</HI> is not of itself sufficient to form
good taste, even though they be attended
with the greatest delicacy of passion. They
must be aided with <HI>Judgment,</HI> the faculty
which distinguishes things different, separates
truth from falsehood, and compares together
objects and their qualities. Judgment must
indeed accompany even their most <HI>imperfect</HI>
exertions. They do not operate, till certain
qualities in objects have been perceived, dis∣criminated
from others similar, compared
and compounded. In all this judgment is
employed: it bears a part in the discern∣ment
and production of every form that
strikes them, But in assisting their <HI>perfect</HI>
energies, it has a still more extensive in∣fluence.
Good sense is an indispensable in∣ingredient
in true taste, which always im∣plies
a quick and accurate perception of
things as they really are.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="95"/>
THAT judgment may compleatly exhibit
to the internal senses, the beauties and ex∣cellencies
of <HI>nature,</HI> it measures the ampli∣tude
of things, determines their proportions,
and traces out their wife construction and be∣neficial
tendency. It uses all the methods,
which art and science indicate for discovering
those qualities that lie too deep spontaneously
to strike the eye. It investigates the laws
and causes of the works of <HI>nature:</HI> it com∣pares
and contrasts them with the more im∣perfect
works of <HI>art;</HI> and thus supplies
materials, from which fancy may produce
ideas and form combinations, that will
strongly affect the mental taste.</P>
<P>JUDGMENT finds out the general charac∣ters
of <HI>each art,</HI> and, by comparing them,
draws conclusions concerning the relations,
which subsist between <HI>different</HI> arts. Till
it has discovered these, none of them can
acquire that additional power of pleasing,
which is imparted to them by their recipro∣cal
connection.</P>
<P>IN every art, a just performance consists
of various parts, combined into one system,
and subservient to one design, But without
<PB N="92" REF="96"/>
the exercise of judgment, we cannot know
whether the design is skillfully prosecuted,
whether the means are well adjusted to the
end, whether every member, which is intro∣duced,
has a tendency to promote it.</P>
<P>IN <HI>music</HI> the <HI>ear</HI> immediately perceives
the pleasure resulting from each principle:
But <HI>judgment,</HI> assuming the perceptions of
that organ, compares them, and by compa∣rison
determines their respective merit and
due proportion. It enables the ear, from its
discovery of the general relations, to distin∣guish
with precision between invention and
extravagance, to discern the suitableness or
unsuitableness of the parts, and their fitness
or unfilness to sustain the main subject.</P>
<P>IN <HI>painting</HI> judgment discovers the mean∣ing
of the piece, not only remotely, as it is
the instrument of that previous knowledge,
which is necessary for understanding it; but
also more immediately, as from the structure
and relation of the parts it infers the general
design, and explains their subserviency to the
main end of the whole. It compares the
imitation with its exemplar, and sees its
likeness. It is judgment, working on our
<PB N="93" REF="97"/>
experience, that puts it in our power to know,
whether the painter has fixed upon the atti∣tudes
and airs in nature appropriated to the
passions, characters, and actions he would re∣present;
and, when these attitudes are various,
whether he has chosen those, which most per∣fectly
correspond with the unity and propriety
of his design. Painting being circumscribed to
an instant of time, judgment alone can perceive,
whether that instant is properly selected,
whether the artist has pitched on that mo∣ment,
which comprehends the circumstances
most essential to the grand event, and best al∣lows,
without a deviation from simplicity, the
indication of the other requisite circumstances.
It estimatesthe due proportion of all the fi∣gures,
in dignity, elegance, and lustre, and
their due subordination to the principal. In
fine, it is necessarily employed in that exhibi∣tion
of the object to the senses, which must
be previous to their perception of it.</P>
<P>IN order to approve or condemn in <HI>poetry</HI>
or <HI>eloquence,</HI> we must take into view at once,
and compare so many particulars, that none
can hesitate to acknowledge the absolute ne∣cessity
of a sound and vigorous judgment.
We must determine, whether the fable or
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>
design is well imagined in congruity to the
species of the poem or discourse; whether
all the incidents or arguments are natural
members of it; which of them promotes its
force or beauty, or which, by its want of
connection, obstructs the end, or debilitates
its gennine effect; what degree of relation
is sufficient to introduce episodes, illustrations
or digressions, so that they may appear, not
excrescences and deformities, but suitable de∣corations.
It is <HI>sense,</HI> which is pleased or
displeased, when these things are determined:
but <HI>judgment</HI> alone can determine them, and
present to sense the object of its perception.
By an accurate scrutiny of the various rela∣tions
of the parts, judgment fixes that situa∣tion,
in which they will appear with greatest
advantage, and most promote that regular
organization, on which both the elegance
and vigour of the whole depends. It com∣pares
characters with nature; and pronoun∣ces
them either real, or monstrous. It com∣pares
them with other characters; and finds
them good or bad in the kind, properly or
improperly marked. It compares them with
themselves; and discovers whether they are
consistent or inconsistent, well or ill support∣ed,
whether their peculiar decorum is pre∣served
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
or violated. Truth and justness is
the foundation of every beauty in sentiment:
It imparts to it that solidity, without which
it may dazzle a vulgar eye, but can never
please one who looks beyond the first appear∣ance.
And to ascertain truth, to unmask
falsehood however artfully disguised, is the
peculiar prerogative of judgment. The
finest sentiments, if applied to subjects unsuit∣able,
may not only lose their beauty, but even
throw deformity upon the whole: and judg∣ment
alone perceives the fitness or unfitness
of their application. This faculty arrogates
also to itself, in some degree, the cognizance
of style and language; and, by bringing it
to the test of custom, discovers its propriety,
purity, and elegance. Judgment, not satis∣fied
with examining the separate parts, com∣bines
them and the feelings they produce, in
order to estimate the merit of the whole.
It settles the relative value of different
poems and discourses, of the same or various
kinds, by a studious and severe comparison
of the dignity of their ends, the moment
of their effects, the suitableness, difficulty,
and ingenuity of the means employed.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="100"/>
THUS in all the operations of taste, judg∣ment
is employed; not only in presenting
the subjects, on which the senses exercise
themselves; but also in comparing and
weighing their perceptions and decrees, and
thence passing ultimate sentence upon the
whole.</P>
<P>BUT, though the reflex senses and judg∣ment
meet, yet, in a consistence with true
taste, they may be united in very different
proportions. In some, the acuteness of the
<HI>senses,</HI> in others, the accuracy of <HI>judgment</HI> is
the predominant ingredient. Both will de∣termine
justly, but they are guided by dif∣ferent
lights; the former, by the perception
of sense, the latter, by the conviction of the
understanding. One <HI>feels</HI> what pleases or
displeases; the other <HI>knows</HI> what ought to
gratify or disgust. Sense has a kind of in∣stinctive
infallibility, by means of which,
when it is vigorous, it can preserve from er∣ror,
though judgment should not be perfect.
Judgment, by contemplating the qualities
that affect taste, by surveying it's sentiments
in their causes, often makes amends for dul∣ness
of imagination. Where <HI>that</HI> prevails,
<PB N="97" REF="101"/>
one's chief entertainment from Works of ge∣nius
lies in what he feels: where <HI>this</HI> is predo∣minant,
one enjoys principally the intellectual
pleasure, which results from discovering the
causes of his feelings. This diversity in the
form and constitution of taste is very observa∣ble
in two of the greatest criticks of antiqui∣ty.
<HI>Longinus</HI> is justly characterised
<Q><L>An ardent judge, who, zealous in his trust,</L>
<L>With warmth gives sentence.—</L></Q></P>
<P>IN him the internal senses were exquisite∣ly
delicate; but his judgment, though good,
was not in proportion. On this account he
delivers just sentiments, with rapture and
enthusiasm, and, by a kind of contagion,
infuses them into his readers, without always
explaining to them the reason of their being so
affected. <HI>Aristotle</HI> on the contrary appears to
examine his subject, perfectly cool and un∣affected;
he discovers no warmth of imagina∣tion,
no such admiration or extacy, as can,
without reflection, transport his readers into
his opinion. He derives his decisions, not
from the liveliness of feeling, but from
the depth of penetration; and seldom
<PB N="98" REF="102"/>
pronounces them, without convincing us
they are just. Some degree of the same
diversity may be remarked in <HI>Bouhours</HI> and
<HI>Bossu</HI> among the Moderns.</P>

<P>BOTH reflex sense, and judgment, it's as∣sociate,

scarce at all show themselves in many instan∣ces,

for ever latent and inactive: and to the <HI>latter,</HI>
culture is far from being unnecessary; by
means of it, the principles of taste may be
improved, very much beyond their original
perfection<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Il est certain que la nature ne fait pas toute seule un bel esprit.

<P><PB N="100" REF="104"/>
WE are scarce possessed of any faculty of
mind or body, that is not improveable.
Even our <HI>external senses</HI> may be rendered
more acute than they were at first. Persons
accustomed to observe distant objects can
descry them more readily than others.
Touch often becomes much more exquisite
in those, whose employment leads them to
examine the polish of Bodies, than it is in
those who have no occasion for such exami∣nation.
Use very much improves our quick∣ness
in distinguishing different flavours, and
their compositions. But the <HI>internal senses</HI>
may receive vastly greater alterations. The
former are <HI>ultimate</HI> principles in human na∣ture;
and, like the elemental parts, or fun∣damental
laws of the material world, are in
a great measure exempted from our power:
the latter are <HI>derived</HI> and <HI>compounded</HI> faculties,
liable to alteration from every change in that
series or combination of causes, by which
they are produced. The former are more
directly subservient to our preservation than
our pleasure; and therefore, like the vital
motions, are almost entirely subjected to the
wiser government of the author of our na∣tures:
the latter, though highly conducive
<PB N="101" REF="105"/>
to our well-being and entertainment, are not
necessary to our being; and may, for this
reason, without great hazard, be in a consi∣derable
degree entrusted to our own care,
and made dependent for their perfection on
the consequences of our own endeavours to
regulate and improve them.</P>
<P>TASTE very early begins to shew itself.
But it is at first very <HI>rude,</HI> inaccurate and
confined. It is <HI>gradually</HI> formed, and by
slow steps advances towards <HI>excellence.</HI> Every
exertion of it, if properly applied, wears off
some defect, corrects some inaccuracy,
strengthens some of it's principles, or gives
it a relish for some new object. Like all
our other powers, it is subject to the law of
<HI>habit,</HI> which is the grand, indeed the only,
immediate means of improvement of every
kind, extending it's power to all our facul∣ties,
both of action and perception. Every ex∣pedient
for cultivating either is but a particu∣lar
species of use and exercise, which derives
it's efficacy solely from the force of custom.
To the forming of taste, peculiar means are
in their nature suited, The same qualities
of the mind, which, by their operation, pro∣duce
the reflex senses, will, by cooperating
<PB N="102" REF="106"/>
with habit, improve and exalt them. What∣ever
therefore usually excites these qua∣lities,
and draws them out into act, must be
a means of cultivating taste. It grows by
such congruous exercise, and always holds
proportion to the natural vigour of its prin∣ciples,
the propriety and efficacy of the cul∣ture
bestowed upon it, and the skill and di∣ligence
with which it is applied.</P>
<P>'TIS easy to trace the progress of taste in
ourselves or others. Children discover the
rudiments of it. They are passionately fond
of every novelty; pleased with order and re∣gularity
in such simple instances as they can
comprehend; delighted with a glow of co∣lours;
admirers of every form which they
think august: they perceive often to a sur∣prizing
degree the harmony of sounds; are
charmed with an appearance of ingenuity in
their diversions; prone to imitate, and grati∣fied
by every effect of imitation which they
are capable of observing: they are very
quick in discerning oddity, and highly enter∣tained
with the discovery of it; and will
hardly ever fail of passing a right judgment
concerning characters, when these characters
are exerted in a series of actions level to their
<PB N="103" REF="107"/>
understandings. But a small degree of excel∣lence
satisfies them; a false semblance of it is
easily imposed on them for the true; any dis∣guise
misleads them. The daubing of a sign∣post,
the improbable tales of nurses, the unna∣tural
adventures of chivalry, the harsh numbers
of <HI>Grub-street</HI> rhyme, the grating notes of a
strolling fidler, the coarsest buffoonry, are suf∣ficient
todelight them. In some, for want of
exercise and culture, the same grossness and
contraction of taste continues always, or it is ap∣plied
in a low, perverse, or whimsical manner.
They may despise a relish for <HI>childish</HI> trifles;
but themselves enter into <HI>important</HI> subjects,
with as little relish as the merest children; or
are perhaps delighted with <HI>other trifles,</HI> a very
little different or superior in kind. Of dress
or equipage, of the beauties of a tulip, of a
shell, or a butterfly, they are accurate jud∣ges
and high admirers. But the sublimity
of nature, the ingenuity of art, the grace of
painting, the charms of genuine poetry, the
simplicity of pastoral, the boldness of the ode,
the affecting incidents of tragedy, the just
representation of comedy; these are subjects
of which they understand nothing, of which
they can form no judgment. Many who
pretend to judge, having pursued a wrong
<PB N="104" REF="108"/>
track of study, or fixed an erroneous standard
of merit, betray an uninformed, fantastical, or
perverted relish. It is only in the few, who
improve the rudiments of taste which <HI>nature</HI>
has implanted, by <HI>culture</HI> well chosen, and
judiciously applied, that taste at length ap∣pears
in elegant form and just proportions.</P>
<P>THUS taste, like every other human ex∣cellence,
is of a progressive nature; rising by
various stages, from its seeds and elements to
maturity; but, like delicate plants, liable to
be checked in its growth and killed, or else
to become crooked and distorted, by negli∣gence
or improper management<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Le sentiment dont je parle est dans tous les hommes, mais comme ils n'ont pas tous les oreilles et les yeux égale∣ment bons, de même ils n'ont pas tous le sentiment également parfait.

<P>IN order to form a fine taste, the mental
powers which compose it must possess
exquisite <HI>sensibility</HI> and delicacy; must be
<Q><L>—Feelingly alive</L>
<L>To each fine impulse.—</L></Q></P>
<P>THERE is naturally a vast difference among
mankind, in the acuteness of all their per∣ceptive
powers. They are in some of so
<HI>tender</HI> and delicate a structure, that they are
<HI>strongly affected</HI> both with pleasure and pain.
In others their <HI>dullness</HI> renders both enjoy∣ments
and sufferings <HI>languid,</HI> This diver∣sity
is in none of our powers more conspi∣cuous
than in <HI>taste.</HI> In some <HI>taste</HI> is so ex∣tremely
<HI>sensible,</HI> that they cannot survey any
excellence of art or nature, but with high
relish and enthusiastic rapture, nor observe
any deformity or blemish, without the keen∣est
disgust. Others, devoted to the exercise
<PB N="107" REF="111"/>
of reason, the gratification of appetite, or the
pursuits of gain, are perfect strangers to
the satisfactions or uneasinesses of taste; they
can scarce form any idea of them. <HI>Addison</HI>
mentions a celebrated mathematician, who
was so perfectly incapable of any impres∣sion
from the charms of poetry, that he read
the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> with no other satisfaction, than
what he derived from a comparison of it,
with a map of the travels of <HI>Aeneas.</HI></P>
<P>SENSIBILITY very much depends on the
<HI>original</HI> construction of the mind; it being
less than any other of the qualities of good
taste <HI>improvable</HI> by use. The effect of <HI>habit</HI>
on our <HI>perceptions</HI> is the very reverse of that,
which it produces on our <HI>active powers.</HI> It
<HI>strengthens</HI> the latter, but gradually <HI>diminishes</HI>
the vivacity of the former. Custom wears
off the difficulty of conception, which ren∣ders
new objects peculiarly agreeable or disa∣greeable.
They come by repetition to enter
the mind with so great facility, that they
give no exercise to its faculties; and of con∣sequence
convey much less intense delight or
uneasiness than at first. Hence it would
seem to follow, that the more we are conver∣sant
with objects of taste, the less forcible
<PB N="108" REF="112"/>
our sentiments should be. And indeed the
most <HI>unexperienced</HI> feel the most <HI>turbulent</HI> and
<HI>violent</HI> pleasure or pain. Use renders both
more <HI>reserved</HI> and castigated.</P>
<Q>For fools <HI>admire,</HI> but men of sense <HI>approve.</HI></Q>
<P>But still we find in fact, that an extensive ac∣quaintance
with the beauties of art and na∣ture
heightens our relish for them. When
we are accustomed to the study, we can
survey no object with indifference; but re∣ceive
higher pleasure or more pungent disgust,
than those whose taste is wholly unimproved.</P>
<P>THE following observations will account
for this seeming paradox.</P>
<P>WERE the <HI>same</HI> object, however excel∣lent,
to be continually presented to our taste,
it must soon lose it's charms; first becoming
indifferent, and then disgusting, by the lan∣guor,
which a continual identity of exercise
would introduce. Hence no natural scene,
no production of art or genius can please us
long, except every new survey discovers
beauties unobserved before, or gives us ad∣ditional
assurance of it's perfection. But the
<PB N="109" REF="113"/>
objects of taste are infinitely various. One
who indulges it is continually changing his
subjects, and feeling pleasures or pains
really distinct, though in the highest degree
analogous. He thus preserves a sort of <HI>no∣velty,</HI>
which tends to keep up the original
vivacity of his perceptions, and the continual
employment of taste produces some <HI>effects,</HI>
which compensate, nay, often overballance
the gradual decay of sensibility by repeti∣tion.</P>
<P>IT is by enabling us to conceive objects
with <HI>facility,</HI> that custom diminishes the
strength of their impressions. But <HI>facility,</HI>
if moderate, is a scource of pleasure: it will
therefore, by it's <HI>immediate</HI> influence, for
some time prevent our delight from being
weakened. It also renders our conceptions,
though less <HI>striking,</HI> yet more <HI>complete</HI> and
accurate. A more perfect object is presented
to the mind, than could be, previous to
use: and it's greater <HI>perfection</HI> may increase
our approbation or dislike, as much as <HI>novelty</HI>
did before: a performance often fails to please
or disgust, merely because, having an inade∣quate
idea of it's parts, we do not observe
the qualities from which these sentiments
<PB N="110" REF="114"/>
should result. A person unskilled in poetry
or painting will survey a work with perfect
indifference, because he does not really see
it's beauties or it's blemishes. But let these
be pointed out to him, by one more knowing
in the art; immediately he begins to approve
or disapprove. Custom supplies the place
of an external monitor, by enabling us to
take in at one view a full perception of every
quality, on which the excellence or faultiness
depends.</P>
<P>IT may be observed farther, that taste,
being a faculty of a derivative kind, implies in
it's exertion mental <HI>actions,</HI> which are strength∣ened
by use and exercise. And <HI>their</HI> im∣provement
tends to support the delicacy and
liveliness of <HI>it's</HI> perceptions. Custom strength∣ens
those principles and processes of thought,
by which our reflex sensations are produced;
and the sensations must always bear some
proportion to the vigour of their causes.
The mind acquires a habit of enlarging itself
into the sentiment of sublimity, by being accus∣tomed
to expand its faculties to the dimensions
of a large object: by use, it becomes skillful
in compounding uniformity with variety; in
measuring proportion; in tracing out design;
<PB N="111" REF="115"/>
in judging of imitation; in blending hetero∣geneous
qualities. This expertness gives
force and boldness to the sentiments produced,
and heightens the attendant consciousness of
our own abilities.</P>
<P>OBJECTS impress us more or less, accor∣ding
to the degree of <HI>attention,</HI> which we
bestow upon them. Custom enables us to
apply our minds more vigorously to objects,
than we could at first. It is not only difficult
to <HI>form</HI> a complete conception of new objects,
but when they excite neither surprize nor
curiosity, it is sometimes even difficult to
<HI>attempt</HI> conceiving them, and to bring our∣seves
steadily to contemplate them. Custom
wears off this indisposition; begets an apti∣tude
and previous biass to the emotions, which
beauty and deformity inspire; and thus ren∣ders
us prone to their peculiar sentiments.
Works of taste fall in with the predominant
temper, and on that account easily engage
the attention, affect deeply, and excite the
liveliest perceptions. It is remarkable too,
from whatever cause it proceeds, that we set
a high value on what we have been long ac∣customed
to. A man of taste places the
pleasures of imagination in a higher class than
<PB N="112" REF="116"/>
other men are apt to do; he esteems them
more noble and substantial: and the opinion
acquired by custom, of their value and impor∣tance
transfuses itself into each gratification.</P>
<P>THE sentiments of taste depend very much
on <HI>association.</HI> So far as they proceed from
this, <HI>cu om</HI> must augment them, as custom,
by adding a new principle of union, renders
the connection more intimate, and introduces
the related ideas more quickly and forcibly.
Custom likewise begets new associations,
and enables works of taste to suggest ideas,
which were not <HI>originally</HI> connected with
them: and what a surprizing intenseness,
the association of ideas, originally foreign, be∣stows
on our perceptions, both pleasurable
and painful, is obvious in too many instances
to require being enlarged on.</P>
<P>BY the concurrence of these causes, the
sensibility of taste is even <HI>augmented,</HI> notwith∣standing
the tendency of habit to <HI>diminish</HI> it.
Its gratification or disgust is often more ex∣quisite,
than any of the emotions which at∣tend
appetite and passion. It becomes so
acute that the <HI>smallest</HI> beauties and blemishes
have force sufficient to affect it. But tho'
<PB N="113" REF="117"/>
the vivacity of its perceptions should some∣times
decay by repetition; yet custom, pro∣ducing
the other perfections of taste, gives a
refinement, elegance, and assurance to our
sentiments, which may compensate their <HI>vio∣lence</HI>
at first. <HI>Judgment</HI> may approve with

is no longer enraptured and enthusiastically

<P>SENSIBILITY of taste arises chiefly from
the structure of our internal senses, and is but
indirectly and remotely connected with the
soundness or improvement of judgment.
The want of it is <HI>one</HI> ingredient in many
sorts of false taste; but does not constitute
so much one species of <HI>wrong</HI> taste, as a
total <HI>deficience</HI> or great <HI>weakness</HI> of taste.
Sensibility may sometimes become <HI>excessive;</HI>
and render us extravagant both in liking and
disliking, in commending and blaming. But,
in truth, this extravagance proceeds much
less commonly from excess of sensibility, than
from a defect in the other requisites of fine
taste; from an incapacity to distinguish and
ascertain, with precision, different degrees
of excellence or faultiness. Instead of for∣ming
an adequate idea of the nature of the
<PB N="114" REF="118"/>
beauty or deformity, we go beyond all
bounds of moderation; and when we want
to express our sentiments, can do it only in
general terms, tumid and exaggerated. If
we are displeased, we signify it, with the
inveteracy of a <HI>Dennis,</HI> in terms of general
invective; and, without explaining the causes
of our disapprobation, pronounce it poor,
dull, wretched, execrable. If we are pleased
we cannot tell, with what, how, or why;
but only declare it fine, incomparable, with
the unmeaning rapture of an ancient rhapso∣dist,
who, without understanding the princi∣ples
of art, or the sense of an author, like a
madman, really agitated by the fury which
the poets feigned, could recite or praise them
with such vehemence as transported himself,
and astonished his auditors<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">From <HI>Plato's</HI> dialogue inscribed <HI>Io,</HI> we learn that there were men of this character, who travelled through Greece and contended at the public festivals. Their chief employ∣ment was, to repeat beautiful passages from the poets, particu∣larly <HI>Homer,</HI> with a rapturous and enthusiastic pronunciation, as if they had an exquisite and warm perception of their excellence. It is probable that they also declaimed in praise of their favourite verses; this seems to be implied in the ex∣pressions, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and is insinuated by the proof which <HI>Socrates</HI> produces of their ig∣norance of art, from the capacity of every real artist to dis∣tinguish beauties from faults, and to point them out in the works of any performer in the kind. <HI>Socrates</HI> proves, from the concessions of his antagonist, that neither did his senti∣ments proceed from true taste, from a vigorous perception of the beauties he recited, nor his encomiums from judgment, from a critical skill in the principles of beauty. He therefore, in his usual strain of irony, resolves both into an unaccountable agitation of spirit, proceeding either from madness or from in∣spiration; and with great humour compares the several muses to as many magnets. The muse inspires the poet, without any agency or knowledge of his; he, in the same manner conveys the inspiration to his rhapsodist, and he to his atten∣tive hearers; just as the loadstone by, it's imperceptible and unaccountable influence, attracts a ring of iron, that a second, and that a third.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>TASTE is so deeply rooted in human na∣ture,
that none are pleased but with some
degree of <HI>real</HI> excellence and beauty. But
a very <HI>low</HI> degree will <HI>satisfy</HI> one who is

to that precise <HI>degree,</HI> of which we
have had experience, and cannot by any
means enlarge them. Our thoughts can
scarce be raised to a distinct conception of
higher pleasure or pain, than we have actual∣ly

<P>HABIT, as was observed, tends to dimi∣nish
the sensibility of taste. From this, re∣finement
in some degree proceeds. In pro∣portion
as our gratifications lose their in∣tenseness
by repetition, we become indiffe∣rent
to the <HI>imperfect</HI> degrees of beauty,
which fully satisfied us before. We are no
longer touched with ordinary charms; but
acquire a kind of avidity, which demands
the utmost beauty and perfection. Where∣ever
this is wanting, we feel a deficience;
we are unsatisfied and disappointed.</P>

<P>USE must greatly promote it, though,
without any cultivation of our faculties, it
should only store our memory with ideas of
<PB N="119" REF="123"/>
a variety of productions. For we should
thus be able to <HI>compare</HI> our present object
with others of the kind. And though men
are well enough satisfied with <HI>indifferent</HI>
performances in every art, while they are
ignorant of <HI>better;</HI> yet no sooner do they
become acquainted with what has superior
merit, than they readily, of their own accord,
give it the preference. And as comparison
has a great influence on the mind, many
things which might be tolerable, if viewed
by themselves, will disgust, when set in com∣petition
with others. To one who has been
little conversant in works of art or genius,
That may wear the charm of novelty, and
appear to have the merit of invention; which
another discerns to be trite and common, or
a mere servile copy. What has in itself
some degree of sublimity or beauty, often
appears mean or deformed by comparison
with forms more august or graceful. The
unexperienced will admire as the effect of
prodigious skill, what one who is acquaint∣ed
with more artful contrivance, or more

sort or degree of beauty appears a real

Crit. sur la poesie, et sur la peinture.</HI> Part i. § 38. The same author repeats and illustrates this observa∣tion in many other passages.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HABITUAL acquaintance with the objects
of taste, not only thus supplies a stock of
knowledge, but also wonderfully <HI>improves</HI>
the judgment. There is none of our facul∣ties
on which custom has a greater influence.
Though at first it could only discover and
distinguish the most <HI>obvious</HI> qualities of things,
it may, by exercise, acquire acuteness, suffi∣cient
to penetrate into such as are most <HI>la∣tent,</HI>
and to perceive such as are most <HI>deli∣cate.</HI>
At first it can take in only the simplest
combinations of qualities or short trains of
<PB N="121" REF="125"/>
ideas: but by being often employed, it ac∣quires
enlargement; and is enabled to com∣prehend,
to retain distinctly, and to compare
with ease, the most complicated habitudes,
and the largest and most intricate composi∣tions
of ideas. In consequence of culture,
it discovers, in objects, qualities fit to operate
on taste, which lie too deep for the obser∣vation
of a novice; it can investigate the
nicest and most complex perfections, and lay
open the most trivial faults<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Quam multa vident pictores in umbris et in eminen∣tia, quae nos non videmus? quam multa, quae nos fugiunt in cantu, exaudiunt in eo genere exercitati? <BIBL>CIC. <HI>Acad. Quaest.</HI> lib. ii.</BIBL></NOTE>. Hence what
was at first censured as a fault, often on our
taste becoming refined, appears a beauty.
When reason is weak, it loses itself in a long
and intricate demonstration; it cannot retain
the connection of the whole; it sees nothing
but confusion; and obtains neither conviction
nor delight. In like manner, in matters of
taste, judgment, when rude and unimproved,
is bewildered amidst the complexness of its
object, or lost in its obscurity; and by being
baffled excites disgust. But, as soon as cus∣tom
has enabled it to surmount this difficul∣ty,
and enlarge its views, it excites high ap∣probation
<PB N="122" REF="126"/>
of those beauties, which were for∣merly
disrelished. As the most complicated
reasonings become most entertaining, the
most <HI>subtle</HI> excellencies produce the most re∣fined
approbation. Being remote, and veil∣ed,
as it were, they give exercise to our fa∣culties;
and, by drawing out the vigour of
the mind, <HI>continue</HI> to please, when the <HI>gros∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI>
and more palpable qualities have entirely
palled upon the sense. They are like those
delicate flavours, which, though not so agree∣able
at first, please much longer than such
as are too luscious, or too much stimulate the
organ<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The truth of this observation <HI>Cicero,</HI> without assigning the cause, illustrates in a variety of instances, with regard both to taste and the external senses. “Difficile enim dictu est, quaenam causa sit, cur ea, quae maxime sensus nostros impellun, voluptate, et specie prima acerrime commovent, ab iis celerrime fastidio quodam, et satietate abalianemur. Quanto colorum pulchritudine, et varietate floridiora sunt in picturis novis pleraque, quam in veteribus? quae tamen etiam, si primo aspectu nos ceperunt, diutius non delectant: cum iidem nos in antiquis tabulis illo ipso horrido obsole∣toque teneamur.

<PB N="123" REF="127"/>
bestowed on the <HI>parts,</HI> in <HI>Gothic</HI> structures,
may please one who has not acquired en∣largement
of mind, sufficient for conceiving
at one view their relation to the <HI>whole;</HI> but
no sooner is this acquired, than he perceives
superior elegance in the more <HI>simple</HI> sym∣metry
and proportion of <HI>Grecian</HI> architecture.
<HI>Italian</HI> music gives small delight at first;
but when once the ear is opened to take in
the complexity of its harmony, and the de∣licate
relations of discords, introduced with
skillful preparations and resolutions, it then
gives exquisite delight. The same may be
observed of the refinements of poetry and
eloquence, of wit and humour. The copious
and varied declamation of <HI>Cicero</HI> will make
a quicker impression, than the simple, ner∣vous
eloquence of <HI>Demosthenes;</HI> but this
gives the highest and most durable satisfac∣tion
to a fine taste. The polite and know∣ing
are chiefly touched with those delicacies,
<PB N="124" REF="128"/>
which would escape the notice of a vulgar
eye.</P>
<P>IT is possible to acquire so great refinement,
epecially when taste is accompanied with ge∣nius,
that we conceive in <HI>idea</HI> a standard of
higher excellence, than was ever in <HI>fact</HI> pro∣duced;
and, measuring the effects of art, by
this absolute and exalted form, we always
miss some part of that immensity, which we
have figured out to ourselves<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">M Antonius—disertos ait se vidisse multos, eloquentem omnino neminem.

to fancy completer effects, than artists have
found means actually to produce; by reason
<PB N="125" REF="129"/>
of some unpliableness in the materials em∣ployed,
the <HI>execution</HI> seems always to fall
short of our <HI>conception.</HI> No performer can
excell in every thing: each is characterised

most beautiful<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin. Hist. Nat.</HI> lib. xxxv. Cap. 9.</NOTE>; we form in our minds a
model of perfection, the parts of which,
though taken from different originals, are
rendered consistent, by the skill with which
they are articulated. A man of genius pos∣sessed
of so sublime a standard, endued with
such exquisite refinement of taste, in what∣ever
art he practises, will represent his ob∣jects,
not merely as they are, but, like <HI>So∣phocles,</HI>
as they ought to be<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Indeed the great masters in every art imitate, not so much individual nature, as a sublimer standard, which exists only in their own conceptions.

<P>But it can be satisfied and filled, only with
the highest perfection that is practicable.</P>
<P>REFINEMENT of taste exists only, where,
to an original delicacy of imagination, and
natural acuteness of judgment, is superadded
a long and intimate acquaintance with the
best performances of every kind. None
should be studied, but such as have real ex∣cellence;
and those are chiefly to be dwelt
upon, which display new beauties on every
review. The most conspicuous virtues will
be at first perceived. Farther application will
discover such as lie too deep to strike a super∣ficial
eye; especially if we aid our own acute∣ness
by the observations of those, whose supe∣rior
penetration, or more accurate study has
produced a genuine subtlety of taste. An
able master, or an ingenious critic will point
out to a novice, many qualities in the com∣positions
of genius, or the productions of art,
which, without such assistance, would have
<PB N="127" REF="131"/>
long, perhaps always, remained undiscovered
by him. And repeated discoveries of this
kind, made either by one's own sagacity, or
by the indication of others, beget in time an
habitual refinement, a capacity of making
similar ones, with facility and quickness.</P>
<P>WHERE refinement is wanting, taste must
be coarse and vulgar. It can take notice
only of the grosser beauties; and is disgusted
only with the most shocking faults. The
thinest disguise, the least depth is sufficient
to elude its scrutiny. It is insensible to the
delicacies of art and nature: they are too
fine, and make too slight an impression to be
observed. As savages can be touched with
nothing, but what excites the utmost extra∣vagance
of passion, so a gross and barbarous
taste can relish nothing that is not either pal∣pable
or overdone. Chaste beauties it has
not acuteness to perceive; complex ones it
has not force enough to comprehend. Look∣ing
only to the surface, it often approves
what is really faulty or defective, and is indif∣ferent
to what possesses the utmost elegance.
Its decisions are, of consequence, dispropor∣tioned
to the real merit of the objects: the
most glaring, the least artificial performances
<PB N="128" REF="132"/>
are sure to gain the preference. It has been
often remarked, that a certain grossness and
want of refinement in the <HI>English</HI> taste, al∣lows,
and even demands a boldness, a grossness,
and indelicacy in their theatrical entertain∣ments,
which would be intolerable to the ele∣gant
taste of a <HI>French</HI> audience.</P>
<P>BUT, an excessive or false refinement, is
equally to be avoided<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">True taste is a proper medium betwixt these extremes. “Ce discernement fait connoître les choses telles qu'elles sont en elles-mêmes, sans qu'on demeure court, comme le peu∣ple, qui s'arrête à la superfi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie; ni aussi sans qu'on aille trop loin, comme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces esprits rafinez, qui a force de subtilizer s'e∣vaporent en des imaginations vaines et chimeriques.” <BIBL>En∣tret. <HI>iv.</HI> d' Arist.</BIBL></NOTE>. It is like a weak∣ly
constitution, which is disordered by the
minutest accident; or like a distempered sto∣mach,
which nauseates every thing. It is a
capriciousness of mind, which begets an ha∣bit
of constantly prying into qualities that
are remote, of discovering imaginary delica∣cies,
or faults which none else can perceive;
while one is blind to what lies perfectly open
to his view; like the old Philosopher, who
was so intent on the contemplation of the
heavens, that he could not see the pit that
had been dug directly in his way. Or it is
a minuteness of taste, which leads one to seek
<PB N="129" REF="133"/>
and approve trifling excellencies, or to avoid
and condemn inconsiderable negligencies; a
scrupulous regard to which is unworthy of
true genius. Or it is a fastidiousness of
judgment, which will allow <HI>no</HI> merit to
what has not the <HI>greatest,</HI> will bear no medi∣ocrity

<P>THIS depravity of taste has led many
authors, studious of delicacy; to substitute
subtlety and unnatural affectation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Quintilian</HI> marks strongly some features of this vicious refinement, as it appeared among the orators of his time. “Tum demum ingeniosi scilicet, si ad intelligendos nos opus sit ingenio.—Nos melius, quibus sordent omnia quae na∣tura dictavit; qui non ornamenta quaeimus, sed lenoci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia.” <BIBL><HI>Inst.

immortal deed. For this noble work de∣served
the honour of being the last action
of his life, that, the author of it being im∣mediately

and eloquence are brought to perfection,
the next generation, desiring to excell their
predecessors, and unable to reach their end by
keeping in the road of truth and nature, are
tempted to turn aside into unbeaten tracks of
nicety and affectation. The novelty catches
and infects the general taste. By its standard
the simplest and the correctest authors are
canvased, secret meanings, artful allegories,
distant allusions, and the like fanciful quali∣ties
are discovered and applauded, where
they never were intended. <HI>Homer</HI> compares
<HI>Menelaus,</HI> exulting at the sight of <HI>Paris,</HI>
when advancing to engage him in single com∣bat,
to a hungry lion, when he seizes a deer
<PB N="131" REF="135"/>
or a wild goat<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. ver. 21.</NOTE>. This similitude strongly
and beautifully expresses the courage and ala∣crity,
with which he met his rival. But this
does not satisfy some of his scholiasts. They
will have <HI>Paris</HI> compared to a goat for his
incontinence, and to a deer for his cowardice,
and his love of music. In <HI>Jupiter's</HI> golden
chain<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, some have discovered an emblem

False refinement dislikes on grounds
equally chimerical and inadequate as those
which procure its approbation. The delicacy
of <HI>Aristarchus</HI> was so much shocked with
<HI>Phoenix's</HI> horrible intention of murdering his

cancelled the lines in which it is, with great

distinction or reserve. But most commonly,
it is the off-spring of vanity and ignorance.
Pride leads us to affect a refinement, which we
have not. We know not in what real excel∣lence
consists; we therefore fix some partial
or whimsical standard, and, judging by it, run
into false elegance, and capricious nicety.
True taste penetrates into all the qualities of
its objects, and is warmly affected with what∣ever
<PB N="133" REF="137"/>
it perceives. Its mimic, false refine∣ment,
fearful left any thing should escape its
notice, imagines qualities, which have no
existence, and is extravagantly touched with
the chimeras of its own creation.</P>

<P>SENSIBILITY disposes us to be
strongly affected with whatever beauties
or faults we perceive. Refinement makes
us capable of discovering both, even when
they are not obvious. <HI>Correctness</HI> must be
superadded, that we may not be imposed
upon by false appearances; that we may
neither approve shining faults, nor condemn
chaste virtues; but be able to assign to every
quality its due proportion of merit or de∣merit.</P>
<P>CORRECTNESS of taste preserves us from
approving or disapproving any objects, but
such as possess the qualities, which render
them really laudable or blameable; and
enables us to distinguish these qualities with
accuracy from others, however similar, and
to see through the most artful disguise that
can be thrown upon them. Though we
never approve, or disapprove, when those
<PB N="135" REF="139"/>
characters, which are the natural grounds of
either, are <HI>known</HI> to be wanting; yet we of∣ten
embrace a cloud for <HI>Juno,</HI> we mistake
the semblance for the substance, and, in ima∣gination,
attribute characters to objects, to
which they do not <HI>in fact</HI> belong. And
then, though merely <HI>fictitious,</HI> they have as
<HI>real</HI> an effect upon our sentiments, as if they
were genuine: just as the chimerical con∣nection
between spirits and darkness, which
<HI>prejudice</HI> has established in some, produces
as great terror, as if they were in <HI>nature</HI> con∣stantly
conjoined.</P>
<P>EVERY excellence is a middle between
two extremes, one of which always bears
some likeness to it, and is apt to be confounded
with it. The right and the wrong are not
separated by an uncontested boundary. Like
day and night they run insensibly into one
another: and it is often hard to fix the pre∣cise
point, where one ends and the other be∣gins.
In attempting it, the unskilful may
readily misapply their censure or their praise.
In every art sublimity is mimicked by prodi∣gious

exaggeration.</P>

himself records and approves many turns of
wit, which to a <HI>modern</HI> taste appear low or
coarse; many of the ornaments which he re∣commends
to an orator, would pass with us
for mere pun and quibble. In the extremes,
affectation and frigidity are very different
from wit; distortion of thought or illiberal
buffoonry from humour; and scurrility or in∣vective
from genuine ridicule: but there are
particular instances, which very good judges
may hesitate, before they can assign them to
one species or the other. Beauties and blemishes
often so far resemble in their general appear∣ance,
that an imperfect taste may readily con∣found
them; approving where it should con∣demn,
or blaming what merits praise. It is
only a well cultivated taste, implying vigorous
judgment, sharpened by exercise, that can in
every case pull off the mask, and certainly
distinguish them.</P>
<P>CUSTOM enables us to form ideas with
exactness and precision. By studying works
<PB N="139" REF="143"/>
of taste, we acquire clear and distinct concep∣tions
of those qualities, which render them
beautiful or deformed: we take in at one
glance all the essential properties; and thus
establish in the mind a criterion, a touchstone
of excellence and depravity. Judgment also
becomes skilful by exercise, in determining,
whether the object under consideration per∣fectly
agrees with this mental standard.
While it is unaccustomed to a subject, it
may, through its own imbecillity, and for
want of clear ideas of the characters of the
kind, mistake resemblance for identity; or
at least be unable to distinguish them, with∣out
laborious application of thought, frequent
trials, and great hazard of error. But when
use has rendered any species of exertion fami∣liar,
it easily and infallibly discriminates,
wherever there is the minutest difference.
We grow so well acquainted with every
form, and have ideas so perfectly adequate,
that we are secure against mistake, when suf∣ficient
attention is bestowed. The real qua∣lities
of things are presented to taste pure and
unmixed, in their genuine features and pro∣portions,
and excite sentiments entirely con∣gruous.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="144"/>
JUSTNESS of taste extends still farther, than
to the distinction of counterfeit for real. We
can compare the sentiments produced, and
discover readily the different classes, to which
they belong. We not only feel in general
<HI>that</HI> we are pleased, but perceive in <HI>what</HI>
particular manner; not only discern that
there is <HI>some</HI> merit, but also of what determi∣nate
<HI>kind</HI> that merit is. Though all the sen∣sations
of taste are, in the highest degree,
analogous and similar; yet each has its pecu∣liar
feeling, its specific form, by which one
who has a distinct idea of it, and possesses
exactness of judgment, may mark its diffe∣rence
from the others. It is this which be∣stows
precision and order on our sentiments.
Without it they would be a mere confused
chaos: we should, like persons in a mist,
see something, but could not tell what we
saw. Every good or bad quality, in the
works of art or genius would be a mere <HI>je ne
sçai quoy.</HI></P>
<P>As a correct taste distinguishes the <HI>kinds,</HI> it
also measures the <HI>degrees</HI> of excellence and
faultiness. Every one is conscious of the
degree of approbation or dislike, which he
<PB N="141" REF="145"/>
bestows on objects. But sometimes the ideas
we retain of these sensations are so obscure,
or our comparing faculty is so imperfect, that
we only know in general, that one gratifica∣tion
is higher or more intense than another;
but cannot settle their <HI>proportion,</HI> nor even
perceive the <HI>excess,</HI> except it be considerable.
We are often better pleased at first with super∣ficial
glitter or gaudy beauty, which, having
no solidity, become on examination insipid or
distasteful, than with substantial merit, which
will stand the test of reiterated scrutiny;
<Q><L>—quae, si propius stes,</L>
<L>Te capiet magis;—</L>
<L>Judicis argutum quae non formidat acumen;</L></Q>
But as the perceptions of an improved taste
are always adequate to the merit of the objects;
so an accurate judgment is sensible, on com∣parison,
of the least diversity in the degree of
the pleasure or pain produced. And if we
have ascertained those qualities, which are
the causes of our sentiments, reflection on
the degrees of them, which things possess,
will help to regulate our decision, and prevent
our being imposed upon by any ambiguity in
our feelings; giving us both an exacter stan∣dard,
<PB N="142" REF="146"/>
and an additional security against judg∣ing
wrong.</P>
<P>THE accuracy of taste may become so ex∣quisite,
that it shall not only discriminate the
different kinds and degrees of gratification;
but also mark the least varieties in the manner
of producing it. It is this accuracy, habitu∣ally
applied to works of taste, that lays a
foundation for our discovering the peculiar
character and manner of different masters.
A capacity for this, as it implies the nicest
exactness, is justly assigned as an infallible
proof of real and well improved taste.</P>
<P>INCORRECTNESS of taste may arise, either
from the dullness of our internal <HI>senses,</HI> or
from the debility of <HI>judgment.</HI> The former
renders our sentiments obscure and ill-defined,
and therefore difficult to be compared. The
latter incapacitates us for perceiving the re∣lations
even of the clearest perceptions, or
the most distinguishable qualities. In either
case, the mind is distracted with suspense
and doubt. This is an uneasy state, from
which we are desirous to extricate ourselves,
by any means. If we have not vigour of
taste enough, to determine the merit of the
<PB N="143" REF="147"/>
object, by its intrinsic characters, we take
up with any standard, however foreign or
improper, that can end our wavering. Au∣thority
in all its forms usurps the place of
truth and reason. The usage of an admired
genius will procure approbation even to
<HI>faults,</HI> from one whose taste is languid. He
is unable readily to detect them; and their
being committed by so great a master, and
intermixed with many beauties, will keep
him from even suspecting that they can be
wrong; and consequently prevent his scru∣tiny.
Like the spots of the sun, which can∣not
be discovered by the naked eye, the
faults of an eminent genius require something
more to enable us to discern them, than the
elements of taste which nature bestows: till
these are invigorated by culture, they will dis∣appear
in the general splendor. The <HI>genius</HI> of
<HI>Shakespear</HI> may betray an unformed taste into
an approbation of the <HI>barbarities,</HI> which are
often mingled with his beauties. The wits
of king <HI>Charles's</HI> court are said to have allowed
<HI>Cowley</HI> an undistinguished admiration. One
may be too much pleased with <HI>Congreve's</HI>
wit, to remark its incongruity to the characters
to which it is ascribed. The veneration we
have for antiquity, aided by the show of
<PB N="144" REF="148"/>
learning, which acquaintance with it implies,
and by the malignant joy, which envy feels
in depreciating cotemporaries, often stamps a
value on its productions, disproportioned to
their intrinsic merit:
<Q><L>—Et nisi quoe terris semota, suisque</L>
<L>Temporibus defuncta videt, fastidit et odit.</L></Q></P>
<P>The opinion and example of others often re∣commends
to us, what is fashionable or new,
without our taking the pains to examine it.
And their opinion is often not founded on
judgment, but dictated by interest, friendship,
enmity, or party spirit. Every period of
time has produced bubbles of artificial fame,
which are kept up a while by the breath of
fashion, and then break at once and are an∣nihilated.
The learned often bewail the loss
of ancient writers, whose characters have sur∣vived
their works; but, perhaps, if we
could retrieve them, we should find them
only the <HI>Granvilles, Montagues, Stepneys,</HI> and
<HI>Sheffields</HI> of their time, and wonder by what
infatuation or caprice they could be raised to
notice<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">RAMBLER, No. 106.</NOTE>. False or imperfect rules, either
established by ourselves, or implicitly re∣ceived
from others, may corrupt or constrain
<PB N="145" REF="149"/>
our taste, and render our decisions unjust.
Had criticism in it's infancy fallen into the
hands of one, in judgment and penetration,
inferior to <HI>Aristotle,</HI> a number of precarious
and unnatural rules might have long obtained
an undisputed authority. A prevailing turn
and disposition of mind often makes us una∣ble
to relish any thing, but what falls in with
it, and thus perverts and prejudices our judg∣ment.
Hence generally proceeds the depra∣vity
of public taste, and the pernicious influ∣ence
it has on public entertainments and dra∣matic
works: and hence, in a great mea∣sure,
the connection of the taste of a people
with their morals.</P>
<P>THESE corruptions of taste can be avoided
only by establishing within ourselves an exact
standard of intrinsic excellence, by which we
may try whatever is presented to us. It will
be established by the careful study of the most
correct performances of every kind, which
are generally indeed the most excellent. But
though they should only rise to mediocrity,
they are fitter for laying the foundation of
correctness, than such as are far superior on
the whole, but faulty in some particulars:
<PB N="146" REF="150"/>
for the greater the beauties, the readier are
the faults to debauch the taste. 'Till it is
formed, and has acquired considerable vigour,
it is dangerous to be much conversant with
those productions, the virtues of which are
eminent, but blended with many faults. The
chief utility of criticism lies in promoting cor∣rectness
of taste. In the most imperfect es∣says,
the authority of the critic will, at least,
excite our attention, and provoke our enqui∣ry.
But every one who really merits the
name conveys much more momentous instruc∣tion,
and more effectually teaches justness of
thinking, by explaining the kind and degree
of every excellence and blemish, by teaching
us what are the qualities in things, to which
we owe our pleasure or disgust, and what the
principles of human nature, by which they
are produced.</P>
<P>CARE however must be taken to preserve
our taste unconfined though exact, to avoid
that scrupulous formality, often substituted
for true correctness, which will allow no de∣viation
from established rules. To disapprove
a transgression of a general law, when the
spirit is observed, and when the end is, per∣haps
more effectually, promoted, is not <HI>just∣ness,</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="151"/>
but <HI>servility</HI> and narrowness of taste.
Who will dislike the landscapes of <HI>Poussin,</HI>
though he has disregarded correctness of draw∣ing
in his animals? <HI>Parmegiano</HI> is said by
good judges to owe the inexpressible greatness
of manner in his pictures, to the neglect of
just proportion in some of the members of his
figures. A contracted taste is chiefly inci∣dent
to those, who would supply the want
of natural talents, by the drudgery of appli∣cation.
But in every thing, the finical is es∣sentially
different from the neat, the exact
from the precise, the regular from the
formal.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the due Proportion of the Principles
of Taste.</HEAD>
<P>THE last finishing and complete im∣provement
of taste results from the due
proportion of it's several principles, and the
regular adjustment of all it's sentiments, ac∣cording
to their genuine value; so that none
of them may engross our minds, and render
us insensible to the rest. This is justness and
correctness, not confined to the parts of ob∣jects,
but extended to the whole. Taste is
not one simple power; but an aggregate of
many, which, by the resemblance of their
energies, and the analogy of their subjects,
and causes, readily associate and are combi∣ned.
But every combination of them will
not produce a perfect taste. In all composi∣tions,
some proportion of the ingredients
must be preserved. A sufficient number of
members, all separately regular and well for∣med,
if either they be not of a piece with
one another, or be in the organization im∣properly
placed, will produce, not a comely
and consistent animal, but an incongruous
<PB N="149" REF="153"/>
monster. In like manner, if our internal
powers are disproportioned to one another,
or not duly subordinated in their conjunction,
we may judge well enough of some parts,
or of particular subjects, but our taste will
be upon the whole distorted and irregular.</P>
<P>As an overgrown member, by drawing
the nourishment from the rest, makes them
weak and puny; so one of the principles of
taste may, by it's too great strength, detract
from the natural force and operation of the
others; and, by attaching us entirely to it's
own gratifications, render us too little sensible
of theirs, though perhaps equally or more
important. If, through an excessive liveli∣ness
of imagination, our sentiments of excel∣lence
and deformity are too violent, they will
so transport us, as to prevent judgment from
scrutinizing and comparing them: our taste
may be sensible and feeling, but will be in∣correct.
A mind over fond of sublimity
will despise the less elevated pleasure, which
results from elegance and beauty. On the
other hand, a soul devoted to the soft im∣pressions
of beauty is unable to expand itself
into the conception of sublimity. A prevai∣ling
relish for the new, the witty, the hu∣mourous,
<PB N="150" REF="154"/>
will render every thing insipid,
which has not, or cannot, suitably to it's na∣ture,
have these qualities<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Le poëte don't le talent principal est de rimer richement, se trouve bientot prévenu que tout poëme dont les rimes sont negligées ne sauroit etre qu'un ouvrage médiocre, quoi qu'il soit rempli d'invention, et de ces pensées tellement convenables au sujet, qu'on est surpis qu'elles soient neuves.

<P>The want of due proportion is one of the
most fertile causes of false taste; and one of
the most common sources of that variety of
forms and modifications, which true taste
assumes in different persons. Every one has
a predominant turn of genius and taste, by
which his relish is more adapted to some one
species of excellence, than to others. This
is inevitable on account of the diversities in∣cident
to men, in the natural bent of their
<PB N="151" REF="155"/>
temper and passions; which always renders
them peculiarly accessible to some kinds of gra∣tification
or disgust. According as the sublime
or the humble passions, the grave or the lively,
are predominant in the structure of the soul, our
relish will be keenest for the grand or the ele∣gant,
the serious or the ludicrous. In this man∣ner,
the necessary imperfection of human na∣ture
prevents our ever being able to establish a
proportion and oeconomy of our internal sen∣ses,
nicely accurate in every respect. A small
disproportion is not censured, because it is
natural: but when it exceeds certain bounds,
it is acknowleged to degenerate into a partial
and distorted form. This distortion is not,
however, so much owing to the original ex∣cess
of one principle as to other causes. <HI>That</HI>
lays the foundation of it; but <HI>these</HI> augment
the natural inequality, and render it more
observable. The principal of these causes is
a narrowness of mind, by reason of which,
we cannot comprehend many perceptions at
once, without confusion, nor trace out their
relations, and ascertain their respective mo∣ment,
without distraction and perplexity.
We fix upon a part, we are engrossed by the
separate sentiment, which it excites, we are
blind to the nature of the other parts, or,
<PB N="152" REF="156"/>
at least, cannot extend our thoughts so far,
as to combine them all into one conception.
A due proportion of the principles of taste
presupposes the correctness of each, and in∣cludes,
additional to it, an enlargement and
comprehension of mind.</P>
<P>THAT it may be acquired, all the internal
senses must be equally exercised. If, by
accidental disuse or perversion, any of them
has fallen below it's proper tone, it must, by
particular attention, be again wound up to it.
Habitual exercise promotes an harmonious
subordination of the principles of taste, by
producing a large compass of thought. It
renders Ideas and sensations so determinate
and familiar, that the largest collections of
them find room to lie distinctly exposed to
the mental eye; and at the same time
strengthens judgment to such a pitch, that
it can view with ease the most complicated
subjects, and decide with accuracy concerning
them. 'Till this enlargement and extensive
amplitude of taste is once acquired, our de∣terminations
must be essentially defective.
Every art has a whole for it's object: the
contrivance, disposition, and expression of
this is it's main requisite: the merit of the
<PB N="153" REF="157"/>
parts arises, not so much from their separate
elegance and finishing, as from their relations
to the subject: and therefore, no true judg∣ment
can be formed, even of a part, without
a capacity of comprehending the whole at
once, and estimating all its various qualities.</P>
<P>THOUGH pleasure and pain are counter∣parts
in taste, our sense of them may be dis∣proportioned
and unequal. If uneasy and
gloomy passions preponderate in the consti∣tution,
and form the prevailing temper, they
produce a superior proneness to sentiments
of disapprobation and dislike. The chear∣ful
and pleasurable affections, on the other
hand, diffuse a tincture over all our powers,
which makes us much more susceptible of
admiration, than of its opposite. This ine∣quality
is frequently destructive of true taste.
A perfect and faultless performance is not
to be expected in any art. Our gratification
must in every case be ballanced against dis∣gust;
beauties against blemishes; before we
have compared aud measured them, we can
form no judgment of the work. For want
of the quickness and compass of thought,
requisite for this, or of inclination to employ
<PB N="154" REF="158"/>
it, we often err in our decisions. Excel∣lencies
and faults are sometimes united in
the same part. A member may be so ele∣gantly
finished, as to gain the applause of
the unskillful; but so unsuitable to its place,
so prejudicial to the unity and effect of the
whole, as to deserve the severest censure
But in every performance, beauties and ble∣mishes
are to be found in different parts. A
contracted mind fixes on one or the other.
It is related of <HI>Apollodorus,</HI> an ancient paint∣er,
that he destroyed his finest pictures, if he
could discover in them any, even the minutest
fault. Some critics, as if possessed with the
same frantic spirit, will condemn a thousand
beauties of the highest rank, on account of a
few intermingled faults, which bear no
proportion to them, and do not perhaps at
all affect the whole. On the contrary, the
merit of a single part will strike a more can∣did
judge so strongly, as to make him over∣look
multitudes of faults, which infinitely
overballance it.</P>
<P>BUT a person of true taste forms his judg∣ment
only from the surplus of merit, after an
accurate comparison of the perfections and
<PB N="155" REF="159"/>
the faults. And indeed the greatest critics<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">This subject is professedly examined by <HI>Longinus,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>
allow the chief merit, not to the greater
<HI>number,</HI> but to the higher <HI>rank</HI> of beauties;
not to that <HI>precision</HI> and constant atention to
every trifle, which produces a cold and lan∣guid
mediocrity, but to that noble <HI>boldness</HI> of
genius, which rises to the height of excel∣lence,
with a kind of supernatural ardor, that
makes it negligent with regard to numberless
<HI>minutiae;</HI> in fine, not to that <HI>faultless</HI> insi∣pidity,
which escapes our blame, but to that
daring <HI>exaltation,</HI> which, however shaded by
inaccuracies, or even debased by the mixture
of gross transgressions, forces our admiration.

<P>THUS we have explained the manner, in
which the principles of taste must be confi∣ned,
to form its just extent; and the finish∣ing
it must receive, in order to its perfection.
As it necessarily includes both judgment and
all the reflex senses; so it must by culture,
be improved in sensibility, refinement, cor∣rectness,
and the due proportion of all its
parts. In whatever degree any of these qua∣lities
are wanting, in the same, taste must be
imperfect. Could any critic unite them all
in a great degree, to his sentiments we might
appeal, as to an unerring standard of merit,
in all the productions of the fine arts. The
nearer one comes to a complete union, of
these qualities of taste, the higher authority
will his decisions justly claim. But when
<PB N="157" REF="161"/>
none of them is wanting, a peculiar predo∣mirance
of one will by no means vitiate
taste. They are so analogous, that an emi∣nent
degree of one will supply the place of
another, and in some measure produce the
same effect: or rather, perhaps, one cannot
exist in full perfection, without implying all
the rest, at least in an inferior degree. <HI>Lon∣gins,
Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus,</HI> and <HI>Aristo∣tle,</HI>
all possessed fine taste. But it will scarce
be denied, that the first peculiarly excel∣led
in <HI>sensibility,</HI> the second in <HI>refinement,</HI>
and the last in <HI>correctness</HI> and <HI>enlargement.</HI>
There is none of the ancients, in whom all
the four appear to have been more equally,
or in a higher degree, combined, than in

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How far Taste depends on the Imagination.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been observed above, that those
internal senses, from which taste is form∣ed,
are commonly referred to the <HI>imagina∣tion;</HI>
which is considered as holding a mid∣dle
rank between the bodily senses, and the
rational and moral faculties.</P>
<P>IT must be owned that the vulgar divi∣sions
of our faculties are generally superfi∣cial
and inaccurate. Our mental operations,
though of all things the most intimately pre∣sent
to us, are of such a subtle and transitory
nature, that, when they are reflected on, they
in a great measure elude our view, and their
limits and distinctions appear involved in ob∣scurity
and confusion. The common distri∣bution
of our most obvious powers, our ex∣ternal
<PB N="160" REF="163"/>
senses, is acknowledged to be faulty:
much more may we expect inaccuracy in
the ordinary methods of classing such as are
less generally attended to. All divisions of
our derived and compounded powers must
be liable to error, till the simple qualities,
from which they proceed, have been inves∣tigated.</P>
<P>IT sometimes happens, notwithstanding,
that, by a kind of natural anticipation, we
strike out juster divisions, than could have
been expected, without reflection on the real
foundation of them. This holds in the pre∣sent
case. If we will but recollect and com∣pare
those qualities of human nature, from
which taste has been explained, we shall be
convinced, that all its phaenomena proceed,
either from the general laws of <HI>sensation,</HI> or
from certain operations of the <HI>imagination.</HI>
Taste therefore, though itself a species of
sensation, is, in respect of its principles, justly
reduced to imagination.</P>
<P>THAT taste is properly a kind of sensa∣tion,
can scarce be called in question, by any
one who has clear and distinct ideas. It
supplies us with simple perceptions, intirely
<PB N="161" REF="164"/>
different from all that we receive by exter∣nal
sense or by reflection. These make us
acquainted with the forms and inherent qua∣lities
of things external, and with the nature
of our own powers and operations: but
taste exhibits a set of perceptions, which,
though consequent on these, are really dif∣ferent;
which result from, but are not in∣cluded
in, the primary and direct perception
of objects. They are however equally un∣compounded
in their feeling, as incapable of
being conceived prior to experience, as im∣mediately,
necessarily, and regularly exhibit∣ed
in certain circumstances, as any other
sensation whatsoever<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Indeed as our external senses are <HI>ultimate</HI> and <HI>original</HI> principles, it may perhaps be taken for granted that this cir∣cumstance is essential to the idea of a sense, and that no power of the mind can be properly expressed by this name, which is derived and compounded, and capable of being re∣solved into simpler principles. According to this hypothesis, the powers of taste would not be senses. To enquire whe∣ther they are or are not, may perhaps be deemed a dispute about words, as the determination will depend upon the defi∣nition of a sense. It is however of some real moment, that the powers of the mind be reduced into classes, according to their real differences and analogies; and therefore, that no definition be received, which would disturb the regular dis∣tribution of them. And that the powers of taste may with the greatest propriety be reckoned senses, though they be de∣rived faculties, will, it is hoped, appear from the following observations. We are directed by the <HI>phaenomena</HI> of our fa∣culties, in reducing them to classes. The obvious phaenome∣na of a <HI>sense</HI> are these. It is a power, which supplies us with such <HI>simple</HI> perceptions, as cannot be conveyed by any other channel to those who are destitute of that sense. It is a power which receives its perception <HI>immediately,</HI> as soon as its object is exhibited, previous to any reason concerning the qualities of the object, or the causes of the perceptions. It is a power which exerts itself <HI>independent of volition,</HI> so that, while we remain in proper circumstances, we cannot, by any act of the will, prevent our receiving certain sensations, nor alter them at pleasure, nor can we, by any means, procure these sensations, as long as we are not in the proper situation for receiving them by their peculiar organ. These are the circumstances which characterize a sense. Sight, for instance, conveys simple perceptions, which a blind man cannot possi∣bly receive. A man who opens his eyes at noon immediate∣ly perceives light; no efforts of the will can prevent his per∣ceiving it, while his eyes are open; and no volition could make him perceive it at midnight. These characters evi∣dently belong to all the external senses, and to reflexion or con∣sciousness, by which we perceive what passes in our minds. They likewise belong to the powers of taste; harmony, for example, is a simple perception, which no man who has not a musical ear can receive, and which every one who has an ear immediately and necessarily receives on hearing a good tune. The powers of taste are therefore to be reckoned sen∣ses. Whether they are ultimate powers, is a subsequent ques∣tion. Those who are unacquainted with philosophy reckon all our powers ultimate qualities of the mind. But nature de∣lights in simplicity, and produces numerous effects, by a few causes of extensive influence; and it is the business of phi∣losophy to investigate these causes, and to explain the phaeno∣mena from them. On enquiry it appears that the internal senses are not ultimate principles, because all their phaenomena can be accounted for, by simpler qualities of the mind. Thus, the pleasure we receive from beautiful forms is resolvible into the pleasure of facility and that of moderate exertion. But, notwithstanding this discovery of the causes of our reflex sen∣sations, we may continue to term them senses, since it does not contradict any of the phaenomena, on account of which this name was originally bestowed upon them. Beautiful forms have uniformity, variety, and proportion; but the pleasure they give us an immediate sensation, prior to our analysing them, or discovering by reason that they have these qualities. We find, on examination, that uniformity and pro∣portion are agreeable. As they enable us to conceive the object with facility and variety; as it hinders this facility from degenerating into languor; and thence we conclude, that the pleasant sentiment of beauty is the result of those sim∣ple principles which dispose us to relish moderate facility, and moderate difficulty; but the sentiment of beauty arises, with∣out our reflecting on this mixture. This sentiment is com∣pound in its <HI>principles,</HI> but perfectly simple in its <HI>feeling.</HI> If this should seem to imply a contradiction, let it be remem∣bered that two liquors of different flavours may, by their mix∣ture, produce a third flavour, which shall excite in the palate a sensation as simple, as that which it receives from any of the ingredients. In like manner, the perception of white∣ness is as simple as that of any colour; but philosophers know that, in respect of its cause, it is compounded of the seven primary colours. Lord <HI>Verulam</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nov. Org.</HI> lib. ii. aph. 26.</NOTE>. concludes from some experiments that the external sense of taste is compounded of smell and touch. Suppose this conclusion just, taste would be a derived power; but still it would be a distinct sense, as its perceptions are peculiar, and specifically different in their feeling both from odours and tangible qualities. Just so each principle of taste is with reason accounted a particular sense, because its perceptions, however produced, are peculiar to it, and specifically different from all others. Each conveys perceptions, which, in respect of their feeling, are original, though the powers, by which they are conveyed, are derived. It is scarce necessary to observe that our ascribing the senti∣ments of taste to mental processes is totally different from as∣serting that they are deductions of reason. We do not prove that certain objects are grand by arguments, but we perceive them to be grand, in consequence of the natural constitution of our mind, which disposes us, without reflection, to be pleased with largeness and simplicity. Reasoning may, however, be employed in exhibiting an object to the mind, and yet the perception that it has, when the object is once exhibited, may properly belong to a sense. Thus rea∣soning may be necessary to ascertain the circumstances, and de∣termine the motive, of an action; but it is the moral sense that perceives it to be either virtuous or vicious, after reason has discovered its motive and its circumstances.</NOTE> Taste is subject∣ed
<PB N="162" REF="165"/>
to the same general laws, which regulate
our other senses. To trace out all these
<PB N="163" REF="166"/>
would be foreign to our subject. We shall
mention but one law of sensation, which has
<PB N="164" REF="167"/>
been so often hinted at already, and which,
by its immediate effects and remoter conse∣quences,
has so great influence on the senti∣ments
of taste, that it will be proper in a few
words to illustrate it. When an object is presen∣ted
to any of our senses, the mind conforms it
self to its nature and appearance, feels an
emotion, and is put in a frame suitable and
analogous; of which we have a perception
<PB N="165" REF="168"/>
by consciousness or reflection. Thus diffi∣culty
produces a consciousness of a grateful
exertion of energy: facility of an even and
regular flow of spirits: excellence, perfect∣ion,
or sublimity, begets an enlargement of
mind and conscious pride; deficience or im∣perfection,
a depression of soul, and painful
humility. This adapting of the mind to
its present object is the <HI>immediate</HI> cause of
many of the pleasures and pains of taste;
and, by its <HI>consequences,</HI> it augments or dimi∣nishes
many others. Though the actions of
the mind succeed one another with surprising
quickness, they are not instantaneous: it re∣quires
some time to pass from one disposition
or employment to another. Every frame of
mind has a kind of firmness, tenacity, or ob∣stinacy,
which renders it averse to quit it's
hold. Every sensation or emotion, as much as
possible, resists diminution or extinction. We
find it difficult to dismiss at once any object,
which has engrossed our thoughts, and to turn
in an instant to another<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Difficile est mutare habitum animi semel constitutum. <BIBL>QUINT. <HI>Inst▪ Orat.</HI> lib. iv. cap. 2.</BIBL></NOTE>. Even after an
object is removed, the frame it produced, the
<HI>impetus</HI> it gave the mind, continues, and ur∣ges
us to go on in the same direction: it re∣quires
time and labour to destroy it. If the
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
succeeding object demand a different confor∣mation
of mind, our application to it must,
on this account, be less vigorous, and its im∣pression
fainter. But if it be analagous to
the preceding, it finds the suitable disposition
already raised, and therefore strikes the sense
with all its force. Hence the mighty effi∣cacy,
which perceptions acquire, in poetry
or eloquence, by being introduced in a pro∣per
order, and with due preparation. Hence
the influence of an habitual and prevailing
temper or turn of mind, in enlivening con∣gruous
perceptions, and in debilitating such
as are incongruous. As far as the sentiments
of taste depend on these principles, so far
they arise immediately from the general laws
of sensation.</P>
<P>WE can explain our external senses no
otherwise, than by marking their differen∣ces,
reducing them to classes, and delineating
the laws of exertion common to all, or pecu∣liar
to each. They are original qualities of
human nature, not resolvible into any others,
more ultimate and simple; but taste, in most
of its forms, at least, is a derivative and se∣condary
power. We can trace it up to sim∣pler
principles, by pointing out the mental
process that produces it, or enumerating the
<PB N="167" REF="170"/>
qualities, by the combination of which it is
formed. These are found, on examination,
to be no other than certain exertions of <HI>ima∣gination.</HI>
That this may become more ob∣vious,
we shall briefly ascertain the nature
and extent of fancy, by exhibiting a detail of
its principal operations, as far as they con∣cern
the present subject.</P>
<P>IMAGINATION is first of all employed in
presenting such ideas, as are not attended
with <HI>remembrance,</HI> or a perception of their
having been formerly in the mind. This de∣fect
of remembrance, as it prevents our re∣ferring
them to their original sensations, dis∣solves
their natural connection. But when
<HI>memory</HI> has lost their real bonds of union,
<HI>fancy,</HI> by its associating power, confers upon
them new ties, that they may not lie perfectly
loose, ranges them in an endless variety
of forms. Many of these being representa∣tions
of nothing that exists in nature, what∣ever
is fictitious or chimerical is acknowledged
to be the offspring of this faculty, and is
termed imaginary. But wild and lawless as
this faculty appears to be, it commonly ob∣serves
certain general rules, associating chiefly
ideas which <HI>resemble,</HI> or are <HI>contrary,</HI> or those
<PB N="168" REF="171"/>
that are conjoined, either merely by <HI>custom,</HI>
or by the connection of their objects in <HI>vici∣nity,
coexistence,</HI> or <HI>causation.</HI> It sometimes
<HI>presumes</HI> that ideas have these relations, when
they have them not; but it generally discovers
them, where they are; and by this means
becomes the cause of many of our most im∣portant
operations<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">For instance, some ideas are of such a nature, that, whenever they occur, they impel to action. It is by making such ideas frequently occur, by constantly suggesting them, that repetition produces the customary tendency, and habi∣tual proneness to an action, which is an essential part in every active habit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEREVER fancy supposes, or perceives in
ideas any of the uniting qualities just now
mentioned, it readily, and with a kind of ea∣gerness,
passes from one idea to its associates;
it bestows such a connection on them, that
they become almost inseparable, and generally
appear together. Their union is so strong,
the transition from one to the other is so easy,
that the mind takes in a long train of related
ideas with no more labour than is requisite for
viewing a single perception; and runs over
the whole series with such quickness, as to
be scarce sensible that it is shifting its objects.
On this account, when a number of distinct
<PB N="169" REF="172"/>
ideas are firmly and intimately connected, it
even combines them into a whole, and consi∣ders
them as all together composing one percep∣tion.
This is the origin of all our complex per∣ceptions.
It is fancy which thus bestows unity
on number, and unites things into one image,
which in themselves, and in their appearance
to the senses, are distinct and separate. All
the objects that affect taste, and excite its
sentiments, are certain forms or pictures made
by fancy, certain parts or qualities of things,
which it combines into complex modes.</P>
<P>IDEAS, which are thus compounded, or
which are even, without composition, only
associated, communicate, by the closeness
of their relation, their qualities to one ano∣ther.
The disposition with which the mind
contemplated the first, by its own firmness,
which makes force requisite to destroy or
change it, and by the strength of the union,
which keeps this force from being applied,
continues while we view the others. And
we imagine, by a kind of illusion, that they
produced the disposition, which in reality was
brought to the perception of them; and we
ascribe to them the qualities which are neces∣sary
for its production. A perception, by
<PB N="170" REF="173"/>
being connected with another, that is strong,
pleasant, or painful, becomes itself vigorous,
agreeable or disagreeable. Hence may be
deduced the force of <HI>sympathy,</HI> which enlivens
our <HI>ideas</HI> of the passions infused by it to such
a pitch, as in a manner converts them into
the passions themselves.</P>
<P>IF indeed the connected ideas have such a
degree of relation, as unavoidably leads us to
compare them, the phaenomenon will be re∣versed,
the effect of the <HI>comparison</HI> overbal∣lancing
that of the <HI>association.</HI> An idea will
appear weaker, less pleasant, or less painful
than it really is, by being introduced by one
which possesses a greater degree of these qua∣lities,
if it is at the same time compared
with it.</P>
<P>IMAGINATION sometimes operates so
strongly, as not only to associate, or even
combine, but also to confound together ideas
or sensations that are related, and to mistake
one for the other. This is the cause of our
often ascribing the pleasure or the pain, which
results merely from our own operations, to
the objects about which they happen to be
employed; and of our confounding together
<PB N="171" REF="174"/>
objects, or ideas, which are contemplated
with the same or a like disposition. It is
likewise the source of many figures, in which
one thing is used for another, as metaphor,
denomination, abusion, and the like.</P>
<P>IMAGINATION does not confine itself to
its own weak ideas; but often acts in con∣junction
with our senses, and spreads its in∣fluence
on their impressions. Sensations,
emotions, and affections are, by its power,
associated with others, readily introducing
such as resemble them, either in their feeling
or direction. Nay, they are capable of a
closer union, than even our ideas; for they
may not only, like them, be <HI>conjoined,</HI> but
also <HI>mixed</HI> and blended so perfectly together,
that none of them shall be distinctly perceiv∣able
in the compound, which arises from
their union.</P>
<P>ALL these are operations of imagination,
which naturally proceed from its simplest
exertions, and are the principles, from which
the sentiments of taste arise. These senti∣ments
are not fantastical, imaginary, or un∣substantial;
but are universally produced by
the energies of fancy, which are indeed of
<PB N="172" REF="175"/>
the utmost consequence, and have the most
extensive influence on the operations of the
mind. By being compounded with one an∣other,
or with other original qualities of hu∣man
nature, they generate most of our com∣pounded
powers. In particular, they pro∣duce
<HI>affection,</HI> and <HI>taste</HI> of every kind; the
former, by operating in conjunction with
those qualities of the mind, which fit us for
action; the latter, by being combined with
the general laws of sensation.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the connexion of taste with genius.</HEAD>
<P>TASTE may be considered either as an
essential <HI>Part,</HI> or as a necessary <HI>atten∣dant</HI>
of genius; according as we consider ge∣nius
in a more or less extensive manner. Every
one aknowledges that they have a very near
connexion. It is so evident, that it has almost
past into a maxim, that the ablest performers
are also the best judges in every art. How
far the maxim is just will best appear, by
briefly determining the nature and principles
of genius.</P>
<P>THE first and leading quality of genius is
<HI>invention,</HI> which consists in an extensive
comprehensiveness of imagination, in a rea∣diness
of associating the remotest ideas, that
are any way related. In a man of genius
the uniting principles are so vigorous and
quick, that whenever any idea is present to
the mind, they bring into view at once all
others, that have the least connection with
it. As the magnet selects from a quantity
of matter the ferruginous particles, which hap∣pen
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>
to be scattered through it, without
making an impression on other substances;
so imagination, by a similar sympathy, equally
inexplicable, draws out from the whole com∣pass
of nature such ideas as we have occasion
for, without attending to any others; and yet
presents them with as great propriety, as if
all possible conceptions had been explicitly
exposed to our view, and subjected to our
choice.</P>
<P>AT first these Materials may lie in a rude
and indigested chaos: but when we attentive∣ly
review them, the same associating power,
which formerly made us sensible of their
connection, leads us to perceive the different
degrees of that connection; by it's magical force
ranges them into different species, according
to these degrees; disposes the most strongly
related into the same member; and sets all
the members in that position, which it points
out as the most natural. Thus from a con∣fused
heap of materials, collected by fancy,
genius, after repeated reviews and transposi∣tions,
designs a regular and well proportioned
whole<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This operation of genius, in designing it's productions, is described with all the beauties of poetical expression, in <HI>The pleasures of imagination,</HI> <BIBL>B. iii. ver. 348–410.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="178"/>
THIS brightness and force of imagination
throws a lustre on it's effects, which will
for ever distinguish them from the lifeless
and insipid productions of inanimated indus∣try.
Diligence and acquired abilities may
assist or improve genius; but a fine imagina∣tion
alone can produce it. Hence is derived
it's inventive power in all the subjects to which
it can be applied. This is possessed in com∣mon
by the musician, the painter, the poet,
the orator, the philosopher, and even the
mathematician. In each indeed, it's form
has something peculiar, arising either from
the degree of extent and comprehension of
fancy; or from the peculiar prevalence of
some one of the associating qualities; or
from the mind being, by original constitu∣tion,
education, example, or study, more
strongly turned to one kind than the others.</P>
<P>A GENIUS for the fine arts implies, not
only the power of invention or design, but
likewise a capacity to express it's designs in
apt materials. Without this, it would not
only be imperfect, but would for ever lie
latent, undiscovered, and useless. It is chief∣ly
the peculiar modification of this capacity,
which adapts a genius to one art rather than
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
another. To form a painter, the ideas as∣sembled
by fancy must give him a view of
their correspondent objects, in such order and
proportion, as will enable him to exhibit the
original to the eye, by an imitation of it's
figure and colour. To form a poet, they
must lead the thoughts, not to the corporeal
forms of things, but to the signs, with which
by the common use of language, they are
connected; so that he may employ them
with propriety, force, and harmony, in ex∣citing
strong ideas of his subject.</P>
<P>CULTURE may strengthen invention;
knowledge is necessary for supplying a fund
from which it may collect it's materials; but
improvement chiefly affects the capacity of
expression. Painting requires a mechanical
skill, produced by exercise: music a know∣ledge
of the power of sounds, derived from
experience: poetry and eloquence an acquain∣tance
with all the force of words and institu∣ted
signs, an advantage which can be obtain∣ed
only by careful study.</P>
<P>THUS genius is the grand architect, which
not only chooses the materials, but disposes
them into a regular structure. But it is not
able to finish it by itself. It needs the assis∣tance
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>
of taste, to guide and moderate it's ex∣ertions.
Though the different relations of
the parts, in some measure, determine the
form and position of each, we acquire much
ampler assurance of it's rectitude, when taste
has reviewed and examined both the design
and execution. It serves as a check on mere
fancy; it interposes it's judgment, either ap∣proving
or condemning; and rejects many
things, which unassisted genius would have
allowed.</P>
<P>THE distinct provinces of genius and taste
being thus marked out, it will be easy to dis∣cover
how far they are connected. They
must be connected in a considerable degree,
since they both spring from imagination: but
as it is differently exerted in each, their con∣nection
will not be perfectly accurate and
uniform.</P>
<P>GENIUS is not always attended with taste
precisely equal and proportioned. It is some∣times
incorrect, though copious and extensive.
It is sometimes bold, yet can transfuse no de∣licacy
or grace into it's productions. But it
is never sound where taste is altogether wan∣ting.
The same vigour of the associating
principles, which renders genius quick and
<PB N="178" REF="181"/>
comprehensive, must bestow such strength on
the several dependent operations of fancy,
which generate taste, as shall make that fa∣culty
considerably active and perceptive<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">There is in one view a still closer connection between genius and taste. A genius for the fine arts implies, at least, <HI>sensibility</HI> and <HI>delicacy</HI> of taste, as an essential part of it. By means of this, every form strikes a man of true genius so for∣cibly, as perfectly to enrapture and engage him, and he selects the circumstances proper for characterising it, and impresses them upon others, with the same vivacity, that he apprehends them himself. See this elegantly explained in <HI>A discourse on poetical imitation.</HI> <BIBL>§ 1.</BIBL></NOTE>
The genius of the greatest masters in every
kind has not been more perfect than their
taste. The models they have given are so
finished and correct, that the general rules
and precepts of the art, afterwards established
by critics, are deduced from their practice,
and the very same which they observed,
though uninstructed. The epos was not
subjected to rules, when <HI>Homer</HI> composed
the <HI>Iliad. Aristotle</HI> did not write his <HI>Art of
poetry,</HI> till after the greatest tragic poets of
antiquity had flourished. These great originals

<P>BUT taste often prevails where genius is
wanting; they may judge, who cannot them∣selves
perform. The operations, that depend
on the imagination, may be vigorous enough
to form a high relish, though it be destitute
of that brightness and extension, which is
necessary for a comprehensive genius. The
associating principles may be strong and ac∣tive
within their bounds, though these bounds
be narrow. And soundness and strength of
judgment may be possessed without considera∣ble
genius; but must always, if joined with
any degree of the internal senses, produce
acuteness and justness of taste. This ren∣dered

he was not, like <HI>Longinus, blest with a poet's

<P><PB N="180" REF="183"/>
IT must however be acknowleged, that
genius will always throw a peculiar brightness
upon taste, as it enables one, by a kind of
contagion, to catch the spirit of an author,
to judge with the same disposition, in which
he composed, and by this means to feel every
beauty with a delight and transport, of which
a colder critic can form no idea. The fine
genius of <HI>Longinus</HI> catches fire, as it were,
from the mentioning of a sublime passage,
and hurries him on to emulate it's sublimity
in his explication of it. <HI>Quintilian,</HI> by the
same union of genius with taste, delivers his
sentiments with the utmost elegance, and en∣livens
the abstractness of precept by the most
beautiful and apposite figures and images.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the influence of Taste on criticism.</HEAD>
<P>AS taste gives the last finishing to genius
in the <HI>author</HI> or performer, so is it the
fundamental ingredient in the character of the
<HI>critic.</HI> The greatest refinement and justness of
taste is necessary, but not alone sufficient, to
qualify one for this office. A critic must not
only <HI>feel,</HI> but possess that accuracy of discern∣ment,
which enables a person to <HI>reflect</HI> upon
his feelings with distinctness, and to explain
them to others.</P>
<P>TASTE perceives the particular beauties
and faults, and thus supplies the facts, for
which we are to account; and the experi∣ments,
from which our conclusions are to be
deduced. But these conclusions cannot be
formed without a vigorous abstracting facul∣ty,
the greatest force of reason, a capacity
for the most careful and correct induction,
and a deep knowledge of the principles of hu∣man
nature. One does not merit the name
of a critic, merely by being able to make a
collection of beauties and faults from perfor∣mances
<PB N="182" REF="185"/>
in the fine arts; to tell in general
that those please, these displease; some more,
some less. Such particular observations fall
as much short of genuine criticism, as a col∣lection
of facts and experiments does of phi∣losophy;
or a series of news papers of a system
of politicks. They are it's rude materials,
and nothing more. And to exhibit them is
the whole that taste can do.</P>
<P>IN order therefore to form an able critic,
taste must be attended with a philosophical
genius, which may subject these materials to
a regular induction, reduce them into classes,
and determine the general rules which go∣vern
them<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Nihil est, quod ad artem redigi possit, nisi ille prius, qui illa tenet, quorum artem instituere vult, habeat illam scien∣tiam, ut ex i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s rebus, quarum ars nondum sit, artem efficere possit.—Omnia fere, quae sunt conclusa nunc artibus, dispersa et diffipata quondam fuerunt, ut in musicis,—in hac denique ipsa ratione dicendi.—Adhibita est igitur ars quae∣dam extrinsecus ex alio genere quodam, quod sibi totum <HI>philosophi</HI> assumunt, quae rem dissolutam, divulsamque conglu∣tinaret, et ratione quadam costringeret. <BIBL>CIC. <HI>de Orat.</HI> lib. i.</BIBL></NOTE>. In all this operation respect
must be had to the subjects in which the excel∣lencies
or blemishes reside, and to the simili∣tude
of the qualities themselves, or of the senti∣ments
which they excite. These are the circum∣stances
<PB N="183" REF="186"/>
common to a variety of particular
phaenomena, which must regulate our distri∣bution
of them. It is not enough to discover
that we are pleased or displeased; we must
ascertain the precise species of either; and
refer it to the sentiment or the expression; to
the design or the execution; to sublimity or
beauty; to wit or humour.</P>
<P>THE qualities common to the lower classes
will naturally be determined first, by regular
induction. But a true critic will not rest satisfied
with them. By renewing the induction,
and pushing it to a greater degree of subtlety,
he will ascertain the less conspicuous proper∣ties,
which unite several inferior species under
the same genus<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Tum sunt notanda genera, et ad certum numerum, pau∣citatemque revocanda. Genus autem est id, quod sui simileis communione quadam, specie autem differenteis, duas aut plu∣reis complectitur parteis. Partes autem sunt, quae, generibus iis, ex quibus emanant, subjiciuntur. <BIBL>CIC. <HI>ibid.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>; and will carry on his ana∣lysis,
till he discovers the highest kinds, and
prescribes the most extensive laws of art, and
thus arrives at the most universal distinctions
that can be made, without falling into the
uninstructive affirmation of mere excellence
or faultiness in general<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">This order of proceeding from the more particular, to the more general distinctions of our sentiments may, perhaps, seem liable to an objection drawn from matter of fact: for it would appear, that critics have determined the most universal classes, but have not yet sufficiently ascertained the species that are subordinate to them. The common defect, with which they are charged, is, that their observations are too ge∣neral. This is undoubtedly the case, as criticism has been, generally, managed: and the reason is, that it has been sel∣dom cultivated by a regular and just induction. It was long ago observed by Lord <HI>Verulam,</HI> that there are two kinds of in∣duction, one imperfect and insufficient, which leads us at once from experiments, to the most general conclusions; the other legitimate and perfect, but scarce ever used, which rises gra∣dually from less general, to more general principles. “Duae viae sunt, atque esse possunt, ad inquirendam et inveniendam veritatem. Altera a sensu et particularibus advolat ad axio∣mata maxime generalia,—atque haec via in usu est. Al∣tera a sensu et particularibus excitat axiomata, ascendendo continentur et gradatim, ut ultimo loco perveniatur ad max∣ime generalia; quae via vera est, sed intentata.” <HI>Nov. Org.</HI> lib. i. aph. 19. In criticism, as well as in philosophy, the fermer method has been generally practised. Indeed in what∣ver regards sentiment, there is a peculiar temptation to pur∣sue this course. For the very feelings excited by qualities that belong to different <HI>genera,</HI> being sensibly distinct, direct men, in some measure, to distinguish them, though not with sufficient precision. But it requires attention and acuteness to mark the lesser varieties of sentiment, which correspond to the species of each. The matter of fact objected only shews, therefore, that criticism has been cultivated by a wrong method of induction. The consequence has been, that even those general distinctions, which appear to be ascertained, are loose uncertain, and ill defined; a defect that can never be reme∣died, till the other sort of induction is applied, and critics be content to rise from particular principles, gradually, to such as are more general. Thus only can our conceptions of all the sentiments of taste, and of the qualities by which they are excited, be rendered accurate and determinate.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="187"/>
To complete the criticism, and render it
truly philosophical, the common qualities of
the several classes, both superior and subordi∣nate,
must be compared with the principles
of human nature, that we may learn by what
means they please or displease, and for what
reason.</P>
<P>ALL this is included in perfect criticism,
which requires therefore the greatest philo∣sophical
acuteness, united with the most ex∣quisite
<PB N="185" REF="188"/>
perfection of taste. If taste is wanting
our conclusions must be defective, faulty, or
precarious: if philosophical genius, our ob∣servations
will be trifling, superficial, uncon∣nected,
and perplexed with too great parti∣cularity.</P>
<P>IT has been often observed that nature is
the standard and archetype of all true rules of
criticism. Indeed the fate of criticism has
been similar to that of every species of philo∣sophy.
It has fallen into the hands of inca∣pable
professors, who, without any regard to
the reality of nature, have attempted to pre∣scribe
<PB N="186" REF="189"/>
rules, formed by their own imagina∣tions.
The accidental usage of an eminent
author on a particular emergency, has been
converted into a standing law, and applied to
cases no ways similar: arbitrary restraints
have been imposed without necessity, and
even shining faults have been recommended
as beauties. But these false systems of criti∣cism,
like their kindred ones in philosophy,
have obtained only a local and temporary re∣ception.
Genuine criticism is evidently very
different; and is justly esteemed a faithful
transcript of nature. For itinvestigates those
qualities in it's objects, which, from the in∣variable
principles of human nature, must
always please or displease; describes and dis∣tinguishes
the sentiments, which they in fact
produce; and impartially regulates it's most
general conclusions according to real phaeno∣mena.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the objects of taste.</HEAD>
<P>WE have seen the importance of taste,
both to the performer, and the
judge. But its proper office and extensive
influence will perhaps appear still farther,
by considering its objects in a somewhat dif∣ferent
light. It may be conceived as em∣ploying
itself about <HI>nature, art,</HI> and <HI>science.</HI>
With regard to nature, which is the com∣mon
subject of the other two, taste and rea∣son
are employed in conjunction. In art,
taste is the ultimate judge, and reason but its
minister. In science, reason is supreme,
but may sometimes reap advantage, from
using taste as an auxiliary.</P>
<P>AS reason investigates the <HI>laws</HI> of nature,
taste alone discovers its <HI>beauties.</HI> It fills us
with admiration of the stupendous magnitude
of the mundane system. It is charmed with
the regularity, order, and proportion, which
every part of it displays, even to the most il∣literate;
with the beauty and variety of co∣lours,
<PB N="188" REF="191"/>
which tinge the face of nature; with
the fitness and utility of all its productions;
with the inexhaustible diversity, and endless
succession of new objects, which it presents
to view. Flowers disclose a thousand deli∣cate
or vivid hues. Animals appear in come∣ly
symmetry. Here the ocean spreads forth
it's smooth and boundless surface; there the
earth forms a verdant carpet. Mountains
rise with rugged majesty; the valleys wear
a pleasant bloom; and even the dreary wil∣derness
is not destitute of august simplicity.
The day is ushered in by a splendid lumina∣ry,
whose beams expose to view the beauties
of the world, and gild the face of nature.
And when the curtain of night veils terres∣trial
objects from our eye, the wide expanse
appears spangled with stars, and opens the
prospect of multitudes of worlds past rec∣koning.
Spring, summer, autumn, present
us with natural beauties, in the successive
periods of their growth; and even stern
winter leaves many objects undestroyed, from
which a vigorous taste may extract no incon∣siderable
degree of entertainment.</P>
<P>SCARCE any art is so mean, so entirely
mechanical, as not to afford subjects of taste.
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
Dress, furnitnre, equipage will betray a good
or bad taste: nay the lowest utensil may be
beautiful or ugly in the kind<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">In how great a degree the beauty of these meaner sub∣jects is regulated by the same principles, from which that of the nobler springs, appears in many instances, produced by Mr. <HI>Hogarth,</HI> in his <HI>Analysis of beauty.</HI>.</NOTE> But the
finer arts, which imitate the excellencies of
nature, supply it with more proper materials;
and thence derive their merit. Music, paint∣ing,
statuary, architecture, poetry, and elo∣quence,
constitute it's peculiar and domestic
territory, in which it's authority is absolutely
supreme. In this department, genius receives
it's decrees with implicit submission; and
reason is but it's minister, employed to bring
into view, and reduce into form, the subjects
of which it is to judge.</P>
<P>THE sciences are susceptible, not only of
truth or falsehood; but also of beauty or
deformity, excellence or defect. As the for∣mer
are primarily regarded, reason, by which
they are distinguished, here reigns supreme,
and is the immediate and proper judge of
merit. Taste exercises only a subordinate
jurisdiction, and must be employed in subser∣vience
to understanding. When this sub∣ordination
<PB N="190" REF="193"/>
is perverted, and taste is principal∣ly
regarded, false and erroneous theories are
introduced. Imagination is substituted for
reason; prejudice supplies the place of evi∣dence;
plausible fables are embraced instead
of solid truths. An immoderate attachment
to novelty or antiquity, to sublimity or sim∣plicity,
has often in science given rise to whim∣sical
principles, and distorted explications of
the phaenomena of things. To one or other
of these causes, we may ascribe most of the
systems of false philosophy, that have ever
prevailed in the world.</P>
<P>BUT taste, when under the entire controul
of reason, and used only as it's assistant, is
highly useful in science. It judges, not only
of the manner in which science is communi∣cated,
but also of the subject matter itself.
Every just conclusion, by extending our know∣ledge
of nature, discovers some new beauty
in the constitution of things, and supplies ad∣ditional
gratification to taste. The pleasure,
which attends the perceptions of this faculty,
strongly prompts us to exert reason in philo∣sophical
enquiries, and, with unremitted assi∣duity,
to explore the secrets of nature
that we may obtain that pleasure. By
it's approbation, it confirms the deductions
<PB N="191" REF="194"/>
of reason, and, by making us feel the <HI>beauty,</HI>
heightens our conviction of the <HI>truth</HI>
of it's conclusions. The <HI>Newtonean</HI> theory
is not more satisfying to the under∣standing,
by the just reasonings on which
it is founded, than agreeable to taste, by it's
simplicity and elegance. As the operations
of taste are quick, and almost instantaneous,
it is sometimes disgusted with the bungling
appearance of principles, and leads us to sus∣pect
them, before reason has had time to dis∣cover
where the falsehood lies. A king of
<HI>Spain,</HI> who had made considerable progress
in astronomy, is said to have been highly
disgusted with the confusion and perplexity,
in which the <HI>Ptolemaic</HI> system involves the
motions of the celestial bodies. His <HI>reason</HI>
submitted to that hypothesis; but his <HI>taste</HI>
disliked it. Instead of censuring the consti∣tution
of nature, he should have suspected
the explication, which represented it as
irregular, and ill contrived. When the mun∣dane
system is justly explained, it appears to
be adjusted with the nicest regularity and
proportion; the sense of which at once con∣firms
the theory, and fills us with admiration
of the supreme wisdom.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the pleasures of Taste.</HEAD>
<P>THE observations we have made concer∣ning
the subjects of taste not only as∣certain
it's genuine province, but likewise, in
some measure, evince it's extensive utility and
importance. It will not however be impro∣per
to complete our view of it's advantages,
by considering it's effects, both immediate and
remote.</P>
<P>IT is the <HI>immediate</HI> source of pleasures, not
only innocent, but elegant and noble. The
powers of imagination are a striking instance
of the munificence of our creator, who has
furnished us not only with those faculties,
which are necessary for the preservation of our
being, but such also as may fit us for recei∣ving
a rich variety of enjoyment. And by the
improvement of these powers, our pleasures
may be still farther multiplied, and rendered
more exquisite. A fine taste qualifies a man
for enjoyments, to which others are perfect
strangers, and enables him to derive enter∣tainment
from almost every thing in art or
nature. It enlarges his sphere of happiness,
<PB N="193" REF="196"/>
by yielding delights, which employ the mind
without fatiguing it, and gratify without
cloying.</P>
<P>THE pleasures of taste, though less im∣proving
than such as are intellectual, are often
as great, generally more rapturous, always
more universally attainable. We need but
attend, and they are infused by every object,
without labour or expence of thought. The
beauties of nature are open to all: and tho'
few can have the <HI>property,</HI> most men may
have the <HI>enjoyment</HI> of many of the wonders
of art. The improvement of taste is easier,
and more certain, than that of reason. Some
are indeed incapable of the highest perfection
of it: But few are so entirely destitute of the
natural seeds of it, as not to receive some
pleasure from it's proper objects. Though
all cannot attain such <HI>justness</HI> of discernment,
as may qualify them for being judges, or
gain them authority as critics; there are
scarce any, who may not acquire the <HI>sensibi∣lity,</HI>
that is requisite for their own gratifi∣cation.</P>
<P>THE pleasures of taste are not like the gra∣tifications
of external sense, followed by un∣easiness
<PB N="194" REF="197"/>
or satiety; nor reflected upon with
dissatisfaction. They are confessedly of an
higher order. A relish for them adds digni∣ty
to a character, and commands no inconsi∣derable
degree of approbation. A man, who
devotes a considerable part of his time to the
gratification of sense, is an object of contempt
or indignation: but a person who can fill up
those parts of life, that afford no opportunities
for social offices, with pleasures of taste, who
can find entertainment for many hours in a
gallery of pictures, or in a collection of poems,
is esteemed on this very account. Justness
of taste procures an author as high a degree
of reputation, as the most curious abstract
disquisitions. <HI>Aristotle's</HI> critical works are
more generally valued than his logic. To the
later he owed the veneration of his implicit
followers; a veneration which free enquiry
has already extinguished: but on account
of the former, all ages will probably admire
him.</P>
<P>THE sentiments of taste spread a lustre over
most of our enjoyments. The pleasures of
sense and the external decorations of life
would be insipid and despicable to every man
of understanding, if ideas of elegance and
<PB N="195" REF="198"/>
magnificence, derived from taste, were not
associated with them. Taste stamps a value
upon riches, as the procuring it's gratifications
is the great end, for which they are desired,
and the worthiest use to which they can be
applied, the execution of benevolent and vir∣tuous
designs alone excepted.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the effects of Taste on the character
and passions.</HEAD>
<P>THE more remote advantages of taste
arise from the influence it has on the
passions and the character.</P>
<P>THE passions, as well as taste, depend for
their production on the <HI>imagination;</HI> and
may therefore reasonably be expected to bear
some analogy to it. Were it proper to enter
on a full discussion of the origin of the pas∣sions,
it might be shown, not only that they
derive their existence, their particular turn,
and their various degrees of strength, from
the operations of fancy, but also that they
owe them, in many instances, to the very
same operations of fancy, which produce the
sentiments of taste. Fancy forms the pic∣tures
which affect taste, by compounding se∣veral
distant ideas into one whole; and these
same pictures excite the passions. <HI>Associa∣tion</HI>
has a very great influence on taste; and
every philosopher, who has examined the
<PB N="197" REF="200"/>
affections with tolerable care, has remarked
the great dependence which they have on
association. Many of them arise from <HI>sym∣pathy;</HI>
and this principle is likewise the
source of many sentiments of taste. Both
our sentiments and our affections are often
rendered more intense by the mixture of con∣comitant
emotions. A strong imagination
produces a vigorous and lively taste; and
it is always attended with keen and ardent
passions.</P>
<P>THUS taste and affection are effects of the
same cause, streams issuing from the same
fountain; and must therefore be in a consi∣derable
measure similar, They likewise mu∣tually
influence one another, and hence de∣rive
a farther similarity. We have remark∣ed
already, that the prevailing passion often
enlivens the sensations of taste, and deter∣mines
it's particular form. Taste as often aug∣ments
the vigour of the passions, and fixes
their prevailing character. Present a mere
abstract idea of good or evil; the mind feels
no emotion. Mention a particular advantage
or disadvantage; desire or aversion, joy or
sorrow is immediately arroused. Tell us that
a man is generous, benevolent, or compas∣sionate,
<PB N="198" REF="201"/>
or on the contrary that he is sordid
selfish, or hardhearted; this general account
of his character is too indefinite to excite ei∣ther
love or hatred. Rehearse a series of ac∣tions,
in which these characters have been
displayed; immediately the story draws out
the affections correspondent. It is only a per∣ception
enlivened by fancy, that affects our
active powers. A very general idea is so un∣stable,
that fancy cannot lay hold of it: but
when a particular idea is presented, the ima∣gination
dwells upon it, cloaths it with a va∣riety
of circumstances, runs from it to other
ideas, that are connected with it, and finishes
a picture of the object represented by that
idea, which will infallibly produce a suitable
affection. Now if we examine the colours,
which imagination throws upon our ideas,
in order to enable them to excite the pas∣sions,
we shall find that the greatest part of
them are extracted from the sentiments of
taste. Honours have a great influence on
most men; but greatest on those, whose taste
is of such a structure, as to give them a high
relish of the magnificence and pomp, which
the possession of honours naturally procures.
There is scarce any quality, that recommends
a person more strongly to our friendship,
<PB N="199" REF="202"/>
than a fitness for gratifying our taste in some
way or another. A genius for music or
painting will sometimes more speedily and
certainly introduce a stranger to the notice
or good offices of a man, who is a tolerable
judge in these arts, than more important ac∣complishments,
of which he is not equally
qualified to judge. A sense of beauty has gene∣rally
much greater influence upon the amo∣rous
passion, than the mere appetite for sen∣sual
pleasure; and is sometimes so powerful,
as even to overbalance, in our choice, the na∣tural
approbation of agreeable mental quali∣ties.
An elegant entertainment is prepared,
not to satisfy hunger, but to please taste. We
may perhaps venture to assert, that every ap∣petite
and passion in our nature, except ava∣rice
alone, or the love of money for the sake
of hoarding, derives it's origin and it's vigour,
in a great measure, from those ideas, which
imagination borrows from taste, and asso∣ciates
with the object of that passion. This
being the case, the passions will naturally re∣ceive
one tincture or other, in every man,
according to the particular constitution of his
taste.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="203"/>
WE find by experience such a connection
between the tastes and the passions of men,
as these observations would lead us to expect.
Great sensibility of taste is generally accom∣panied
with lively passions. Women have
always been considered as possessing both in
a more eminent degree than men. Quick∣ness
of taste is essential to poetic genius; and
<HI>Horace</HI> has assigned to poets the correspon∣dent
turn of passion, when he characterises
them <HI>genus irritabile.</HI> A gross, uncultivated
taste produces a grossness and indelicacy of
passion, But wherever a delicate taste pre∣vails,
it bestows a certain refinement and ele∣gance
on our principles of action, which
makes us despise many objects as gross and
coarse, which vulgar minds pursue with ar∣dour:
and even when we are attached to the
very same things with other men, it gives a
peculiar politeness to our manner of affecting
them. Savages have a grossness both of taste
and of passion, which distinguishes them from
civilized nations. The vulgar in every na∣tion
are distinguished, by the same circum∣stance,
from the polite. Whatever quality
gives a tincture to the taste of a nation, is
found to tinge also the national character.
<PB N="201" REF="204"/>
The <HI>French</HI> have a peculiar delicacy of taste:
and a peculiar vivacity and elegance runs
through their manners. The irregularity and
boldness of the <HI>English</HI> taste corresponds ex∣actly
with the general spirit of the nation.
The stateliness, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> affect
in their behaviour, is analagous to the lofti∣ness
which they approve in composition. It
is no difficult matter to trace a like connec∣tion
between taste and character in indivi∣duals.</P>
<P>THIS connection may be owing, in some
measure, to the influence, which the passions
have on taste. But it can scarce be doubted,
that it arises as frequently from the tincture,
which taste gives to the passions: especially
when we recollect that the ideas which ex∣cite
the passions are, in a great measure, de∣rived
from the sentiments of taste.</P>
<P>IF it should farther appear, that a just and
well regulated taste has a peculiar tendency
to confirm virtuous affections and principles,
it's importance would be still more conspi∣cuous.
Those who have enquired, whether
it has this tendency, seem to have run into
extremes. Some represent these qualities in
<PB N="202" REF="205"/>
actions and affections, which excite our mo∣ral
approbation, as the same with those qua∣lities,
which, in a picture or a poem, produce
the gratification of taste; and think that it
is the same faculty, which is pleased in both
cases<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">This is often asserted, or very directly insinuated, by Lord SHAFTESBURY. See <HI>Characteristics,</HI> passim.</NOTE>. But experience will scarce sup∣port
this opinion. A taste for the fine arts,
and a high sense of virtue, which, on this
hypothesis, would be the same, are often se∣parated:
and a careful examination of the
moral faculty, would probably lead us to de∣rive
it from other principles, than those from
which taste has been explained. There
seems however to be as little reason for de∣termining
with others, that taste has no in∣fluence
upon morality<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">This opinion is maintained by Mr. BROWN, <HI>Essay on Characteristics,</HI> § 7.</NOTE>. It may be sepa∣rated
from virtue; it may accidentally lead
men to act viciously, for it's gratification: but
that it is naturally more favourable to virtue
than to vice, may be inferred from many of
the acknowledged qualities of the human
mind.</P>
<P>MOST wrong passions may be traced up
to some perversion of taste, which produces
<PB N="203" REF="206"/>
them, by leading us to misapprehend their
objects. It would be almost superfluous to
undertake a formal proof, that luxury, prodi∣gality,
ambition, arise chiefly from this
cause. And it is evident, that, if taste were
perfectly formed, so as to discover that it is
a false beauty or sublimity, or at least an in∣ferior
species, that belongs to these vices or
their objects; and if it were accustomed to
the purer and nobler subjects about which
it may be employed, those ideas, which now
mislead so many, must lose a great influence
upon them, Vice is often promoted by taste
ill formed or wrong applied: let taste be
rendered correct and just, vice will be almost
extinguished; for our opinions of things will
be, in most cases, true and suited to their
natures.</P>
<P>A MAN who is acquainted with high and
noble pleasures naturally despises such as are
far inferior. A relish for the gratifications of
taste will enable a man, in some degree, to
undervalue the pleasures of sense, and to dis∣regard
the calls of appetite, which are the
greatest obstructions to the prevalence of
good affections. A man of an improved taste
puts very little value on sensual delights, ex∣cept
<PB N="204" REF="207"/>
so far as they come to him, recommend∣ed
by an opinion of elegance. And it has
been already observed that a perfectly just
taste would enable him to strip this recom∣mendation
in a great measure of it's force.</P>
<P>ANY sentiment or affection which is suita∣ble
to the prevailing biass of the mind, will
derive peculiar strength from that biass. A
just and elegant taste, frequently employed
puts the mind into an habitual disposition,
more congruous to the agreeable feeling, and
gentle impulses of kind affection, than to the
more tumultuous agitations of the rougher
passions. The exercise of taste begets sereni∣ty,
and satisfaction. When these prevail,
the mind is prone to benevolence. This af∣fection
finds the mind already in a temper
suited to it; and it strikes deep it's roots, as
in a soil, which supplies it with it's natural
nourishment, in great abundance. A man is
seldom better disposed to friendship, generofi∣ty,
love, and the whole train of kind affections,
than when his mind has been softened, by
the charms of music, painting, or poetry.
It is universally acknowledged, that these arts,
when properly applied, are very powerful in
recommending virtue. And their power
<PB N="205" REF="208"/>
arises, in a great measure, from the circum∣stance
which we are now considering. Their
immediate gratifications, by producing a con∣gruous
disposition, prepare the mind for being
deeply impressed with the moral sentiments
and affections, which they are fitted to in∣sinuate.</P>
<P>ALL the principles of the human mind
have so near a connection, that one of them
can scarce be considerably altered, but it pro∣duces
a similar alteration in the rest. A vi∣gorous
taste, not only is affected with every
the minutest object, directly presented to it;
but imparts also a peculiar sensibility to all
the other powers of the soul. Refinement
of taste makes a man susceptible of delicate
feelings on every occasion; and these increase
the acuteness of the moral sense, and render
all it's perceptions stronger and more exqui∣site.
On this account a man of nice taste
will have a stronger abhorrence of vice, and
a keener relish for virtue, in any given situ∣ation,
than a person of dull organs can have,
in the same circumstances. Hence it proceeds
in part that many actions are reckoned either
virtuous or vicious by civilized nations, which
to savages appear perfectly indifferent. This
<PB N="206" REF="209"/>
may rather be ascribed to an elegance of taste
gradually introduced by society, than to any
peculiar disposition to virtue. The moral
sense is, in savages, so dull that the qualities
of these actions are imperceptible to them,
and their sentiments in other instances are
weak in proportion. Civilized nations have
delicacy sufficient to perceive moral qualities
in actions, which make no impression on a
savage; and this delicacy renders more vigo∣rous,
in proportion, the perceptions which
they have from those actions that are approved
or disapproved by savages themselves. Thus
the cultivation of taste gives new force to the
sentiments of the moral faculty, and by this
means renders it more powerful to repress the
vicious passions, and support the virtuous.</P>
<P>IT is likewise to be observed that, though
taste and the moral sense are distinct powers,
yet many actions and affections are fit to gra∣tify
both. What is virtuous and obligatory
is often also beautiful or sublime. What is
vicious may be at the same time mean, de∣formed,
or ridiculous. A man, whose taste
is uncultivated, has no motive in these cases,
but what arises from the moral principle. A
person of improved taste, not only has this
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>
in it's greatest strength, but is capable of ad∣ditional
motives derived from taste; and, hav∣ing
thus a double impulse, must be more
strongly prompted than the other. It must
be acknowledged indeed that some vices ap∣pear
sublime or elegant, and may therefore
be recommended by taste. But they always
have these qualities in a less degree than the
opposite virtues. Superiority to external
things is nobler than ambition. Admiration
of these vices therefore implies a defect of just
taste. Where this faculty is perfect, it always
prefers virtue to vice.</P>
<P>IN order to give the foregoing observations
their full weight, it is necessary to remember
that many different causes concur in forming
the characters of men. Taste is but one of
these causes; and not one of the most power∣ful.
It is not therefore to be expected that
the character should be, in every instance,
perfectly analogous to the taste. Other causes
may counteract the influence of this principle
and render the turn of the passions dissimilar
to it's structure. On this account, examples
of a good taste joined with gross passions or a
vicious character are far from being sufficient
to prove that taste has no connection with
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>
morals. This heterogeneous composition
may be otherwise accounted for. All our
conclusions concerning human nature must
be founded on experience: but it is not ne∣cessary
that every conclusion should be <HI>imme∣diately</HI>
deduced from experiment. A conclu∣sion
is often sufficiently established, if it be
shewn that it necessarily results from general
qualities of the human mind, which have
been ascertained by experiment and induction.
This is the natural method of establishing
synthetical conclusions; especially where an
effect is produced by a complication of causes.
This is the case in the subject of our present
enquiry. The character and the passions are
affected by many different causes; of which
taste is one. Taste in the fine arts may ap∣pear
to be wanting in some men, because
they have had no opportunities of exercising
it on subjects of that kind; while, at the same
time, the natural principles of it being vigo∣rous,
and all men being conversant about the
objects of affection, it may bestow a delicacy
and refinement on the character. Affectation
may disguise the passions; imitation may ren∣der
them unsuitable to the turn of taste; ha∣bit
may make them run counter to it: but
taste has, notwithstanding, a natural tenden∣cy
to influence them.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following essays, upon the same sub∣ject
which Professor <HI>GERRARD</HI> has treated
in such a masterly manner, are the productions
of three of the greatest and most elegant writers,
that the <HI>French</HI> nation has ever produced.
There can then be no doubt about their title
to a place in this volume, which, by such a va∣luable
addition, will contain, perhaps, all that
can be said concerning the principles, the nature,
the characters and extent, the rise and decline
of true <HI>taste;</HI> matters hitherto injudiciously
treated by many pens, and but superficially by
the best. But notwithstanding the merit of
these essays, it is owing to Mr. <HI>GERRARD'S</HI>
candid and generous permission, that they are
admitted into a volume which was appropriated
to his own excellent performance. The genuine
love of truth dispells those anxious fears of ri∣vality,
which are the result of a narrow and
selfish ambition, and not of a noble and generous
emulation. Besides, Mr. <HI>GERRARD'S</HI> talents
render such anxious fears entirely groundless.
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
On the other hand, our ingenious professor
cannot be displeased, that his name should go
down to posterity in company with those of
<HI>MONTESQUIEU, D'ALEMBERT,</HI> and <HI>VOL∣TAIRE.</HI></P>
<P>The essays of the two latter are finished
pieces. That of the late president <HI>MONTES∣QUIEU</HI>
is an imperfect fragment, an assem∣blage
of scattered thoughts, the first strokes of
his pencil, in which we see the noble subject
sketched out in part, and the principal colours
that enter into the composition of true <HI>taste</HI>
thrown carelesly upon the canvass. For while
the noble artist was drawing his outlines, and
gathering materials for his work, he was
seized with a disorder, which prevented him
from giving it the finishing touch, and depri∣ved
the republick of letters of one of it's bright∣est
ornaments. The thoughts, however, of such
an original genius, unconnected as they may be,
will be highly acceptable to such as know that
there is a true sublime always to be found in
the first and most imperfect sketches of great
masters, and that the rude designs of a <HI>RUBENS</HI>
are infinitely more valuable than many a correct
and finished piece.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON
TASTE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MR. DE VOLTAIRE.</BYLINE>
<P>THE external sense, with which nature
has furnished us, and by which we
distinguish and relish the various kinds of
nourishment, that are adapted to health and
pleasure, has in all languages given occasion
to the metaphorical word <HI>taste,</HI> by which we
express our perception of beauty, deformity,
or defect in the several arts. <HI>Taste</HI> then,
in general, is a quick discernment, a sudden
perception, which, like the sensation of the
palate, anticipates reflexion; like the palate,
it relishes what is good with an exquisite and
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
voluptuous sensibility, and rejects the contrary
with loathing and disgust; like the palate
also, it is often doubtful, and, as it were, be∣wildered,
not knowing whether it should
relish or reject certain objects, and frequent∣ly
requires the influence of habit to give it a
fixed and uniform determination.</P>
<P>TO have a <HI>taste,</HI> supposes something more
than merely to perceive, and to discern with
accuracy the beauty of any work or object.
This beauty must be <HI>felt,</HI> as well as <HI>perceived;</HI>
the mind must be touched and affected by it
in a lively and sensible manner. This feeling
however, in order to constitute true <HI>taste,</HI>
must not be a vague and confused sensation;
but must be attended with a distinct view, a
quick and comprehensive discernment of the
various qualities, in their several relations and
connexions, which enter into the composition
of the object we contemplate. And in this
we see another striking resemblance between
the intellectual taste and the sensual one; for
as a nice palate perceives immediately the
mixture of different wines, so the man of
taste will quickly discern the motley mixture
of different styles in the same production;
and let the beauties and defects be ever so
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
closely blended in an object, will always be
capable of distinguishing the former from the
latter.</P>
<P>AS the corruption of the <HI>sensual taste</HI> dis∣covers
itself by a relish for only those delicate
and high seasoned dishes, in which all the
refinements of art have been employed to ex∣cite
a forced sensation of pleasure; so the de∣pravity
of the <HI>intellectual taste</HI> manifests itself
by an attachment to far-fetched and studied
ornaments, and by a want of relish for those
beauties which are unaffected and natural.
The corruption of the sensual taste, which
makes us delight in such aliments as are dis∣gusting
to those, whose organs are in a good
state, is in reality a kind of disease; nor is
that depravity of the intellectual taste which
makes many prefer the <HI>burlesque</HI> to the <HI>sub∣lime,</HI>
and the laboured stiffness of art, to the
beautiful simplicity of nature, less a disease in
our mental frame.</P>
<P>THE intellectual <HI>taste</HI> is much more form∣ed
by education and culture, than the sensual
one; for though the latter may be brought,
by habit, to relish what at first excited loath∣ing
and disgust; yet it does not seem to have
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
been the intention of nature, that the general∣ity
of mankind should acquire by custom and
experience, those sensations and perceptions
which are necessary to their preservation. It
is otherwise with the <HI>intellectual taste:</HI> it's
formation requires time, instruction, and ex∣perience.
A young man uninstructed in the
arts of music and painting, let his natural
sensibility be ever so quick and lively, will
not immediately distinguish, in a grand concert
of music, the various parts whose connexion
and relation constitute the essence and charm
of the composition, nor will he perceive in
a picture the gradations of light and shade,
that harmony of colours, that correctness of
design which characterize a finished piece;
but in process of time, and also by degrees,
he learns both to hear and to see in a more
perfect manner. The same uninstructed
person will find a variety of emotions arise in
his mind, the first time he is present at the
representation of a fine tragedy; but he will
neither perceive the dexterity of the author in
maintaining the unities, nor that exquisite
art by which the drama is so managed, that
no person enters upon the scene nor quits it
without an evident reason, nor yet that still
more nice and difficult art of making the va∣rious
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
subordinate interests terminate and cen∣ter
in one, which absorbs them all. It is
only by the force of habit and reflexion, that
he will distinguish these several objects of
<HI>taste,</HI> and feel delightful sensations from cir∣cumstances,
of which formerly he had little
or no idea.</P>
<P>ELEGANT and able artists may communi∣cate
their feelings and their discernment to
others, and thus excite <HI>taste</HI> in a nation,
which, without them, had never known it's
refined pleasures. By frequently contempla∣ting
the works of great and eminent masters
in the various arts, the powers of nature
arise into <HI>taste,</HI> and we imbibe, as it were,
the spirit of these illustrious men, so as to
come at length to look at a gallery of paintings
with the eyes of a <HI>Le Brun,</HI> a <HI>Poussin,</HI> or a
<HI>Le Sueur;</HI> to hear the declamation of <HI>Quinaut's</HI>
operas, with the ear of a <HI>Lulli;</HI> and the airs
and symphonies with that of a <HI>Rameau.</HI> Nay,
we even read works of learning and genius,
with a portion of that spirit that appears in
their composition.</P>
<P>IF in the first periods of the culture of the
arts and sciences it has sometimes happened
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
that a whole nation have been unanimous in
the praise of authors full of defects, and whom
succeeding ages have beheld with indifference,
and even with contempt; the reason is, that
these authors had natural beauties which
were perceived by all, while that just discern∣ment
that was necessary to distinguish their
numerous defects, and which is less the gift
of nature, than the result of time, habit, and
reflexion, was as yet acquired by none. Thus
<HI>Lucilius,</HI> who had been in the highest repu∣tation
among the Romans, sunk into oblivion
when <HI>Horace</HI> arose; and <HI>Regnier</HI> was univer∣sally
admired by the French, until <HI>Boileau</HI>
appeared; and if there are several ancient
authors, who have maintained their credit,
notwithstanding the absurdities that are to be
found in every page of their writings, it must
be the authors of those nations, among whom
no judicious and correct writer has appeared
to open their eyes, like <HI>Horace</HI> among the
Romans, and <HI>Boileau</HI> among the French.</P>
<P>IT is a common saying, that there is no
disputing about tastes: And if by <HI>taste</HI> here be
understood the palate, which loaths certain
aliments and relishes others, the maxim is
just; because it is needless to dispute about
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
what cannot be corrected, or to attempt re∣forming
the constitution and mechanism of
organs merely corporeal. But the maxim is
false and pernicious, when applied to that
<HI>intellectual taste,</HI> which has for it's objects the
arts and sciences. As these objects have real
charms, so there is in reality a good taste
which perceives them, and a bad one which
perceives them not; and there are certain
methods, by which we may often correct
those mental defects which produce a depra∣ved
<HI>taste.</HI> But it must be granted, at the
same time, that there are certain phlegmatick
spirits, which nothing can enflame, and also
certain distorted intellects, which it is im∣possible
to rectify; with such therefore, it
is in vain to dispute about tastes, because
they have none at all.</P>
<P>IN many things Taste seems to be of an
arbitrary nature, and without any fixed or
uniform direction, such as in the choice of
dress and equipage, and in every thing that
does not come within the circle of the finer
arts. In this low sphere it should be distin∣guished,
methinks, by the name of <HI>fancy;</HI>
for it is <HI>fancy</HI> rather than <HI>taste,</HI> that produces
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
such an endless variety of new and contradic∣tory
modes.</P>
<P>THE taste of a nation may degenerate and
become extremely depraved; and it almost
always happens that the period of it's perfec∣tion
is the forerunner of it's decline. Artists
through the apprehension of being regarded
as mere imitators, strike out into new and un∣common
paths, and turn aside from the beau∣tiful
simplicity of nature, which their prede∣cessors
invariably kept in view. In these ef∣forts
there is a certain degree of merit, which
arises from industry and emulation, and casts
a veil over the defects which accompany their
productions. The publick, fond of novelty,
applauds their invention; but this applause
is soon succeeded by satiety and disgust. A
new set of artists start up, invent new me∣thods
to please a capricious taste, and depart
still further from nature than those who first
ventured from it's paths into the wilds of
fancy. Thus the taste of a people degene∣rates
into the grossest corruption. Over∣whelmed
with new inventions, which suc∣ceed
and efface each other with incredible
rapidity, they scarcely know where they are,
and cast back their eager and anxious desires
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
towards the period, when <HI>true taste</HI> reigned
under the empire of nature. But they implore
it's return in vain; that happy period cannot
be recalled, it deposits however in the custo∣dy
of certain choice spirits the sublime plea∣sures
of <HI>true taste,</HI> which they cherish and
enjoy in their little circle, remote from the
profane eye of the depraved and capricious
multitude.</P>
<P>THERE are vast countries, where <HI>taste</HI> has
not yet been able to penetrate. Such are
those uncultivated wastes, where civil society
has never been brought to any degree of
perfection, where there is little intercourse
between the sexes, and where all representa∣tions
of living creatures in painting and sculp∣ture
are severely prohibited by the laws of
religion. Nothing renders the mind so
narrow, and so little, if I may use that
expression, as the want of social inter∣course;
this confines it's faculties, blunts
the edge of genius, damps every noble
passion, and leaves in a state of languor
and inactivity every principle, that could
contribute to the formation of <HI>true taste.</HI>
Besides, where several of the finer arts are
wanting, the rest must necessarily languish
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
and decay, since they are inseparably con∣nected
together, and mutually support each
other. This is one reason, why the Asi∣aticks
have never excelled in any of the
arts, and hence also it is that <HI>true taste</HI>
has been confined to certain countries in
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>

ON THE
USE and ABUSE of PHILOSOPHY
In MATTERS that are properly relative

<P>THE philosophical spirit, so celebrat∣ed
by one part of our nation, and so
decried by another, has produced different
and even contrary effects, according as we
consider it with respect to the Sciences, or in
relation to the Belles Lettres. Operating in
the sphere of science, to which it properly
<PB N="224" REF="227"/>
belongs, it has set limits to that passion for
explaining all things which arose from the
towering pride of system; but entering into
the circle of Belles Lettres it has presumed,
on the contrary, to analyse our pleasures, to
call be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it's tribunal the more elegant
feelings of the human mind, and to submit
to it's examination the various objects of
<HI>taste.</HI> If the wise moderation, which has
been observed, in these later times, by phi∣losophers
in matters of science, has met with
much contradiction; is it surprizing that the
encroaching spirit of the new adventurers in
literature has also been opposed? This phi∣losophical
spirit, applied to the objects of
<HI>taste,</HI> must undoubtedly displease such of our
writers as imagine, that, in matters of taste,
as well as in those of a more serious kind,
every paradox ought to be rejected, every
new opinion banished, and that, merely
because it is new. This way of thinking,
however, appears to me both unreasonable
and pernicious; we cannot extend too far the
liberty of examining, judging, and inventing
in matters of speculation and literary amuse∣ment,
even though, in many cases, that
liberty should be utterly unsuccessful in it's
efforts. The flight of genius must be un∣restrained,
<PB N="225" REF="228"/>
since it is often in the midst of it's
wildest excursions that it creates the true
sublime. Such also is the case with the fa∣culty
of reason, or the philosophical spirit.
Let us therefore permit this discerning spirit
to extend indiscriminately, though sometimes
without success, it's inspection to all the ob∣jects
of our pleasures, and by that means
put it in a capacity of striking out new paths,
and conducting genius itself into unknown
regions.</P>
<P>ONE of the great advantages of philosophy
in it's application to matters of <HI>taste,</HI> is it's
being so admirably adapted to cure, or to
prevent, that excessive veneration for a certain
class of authors, which we may call by the
name of literary superstition. It will justify
our esteem of the ancients by rendering that
esteem rational, and reducing it within it's
proper bounds; it will prevent our admiring
them in their defects; it will shew us their
equals in several of our modern writers, who,
because they have followed the models exhi∣bited
by the ancients, are so unreasonably
modest as to esteem themselves inferior to
their masters. But it will be asked, whether
this method of analyzing metaphysically mat∣ters
<PB N="226" REF="229"/>
of feeling and sentiment, will not be at∣tended
with many inconveniencies? Whe∣ther
it will not often engage us to enquire
into the reasons of things which have no rea∣son
at all, damp our pleasure by leading us
into the custom of discussing coldly what was
designed by nature to touch and to inflame,
and put such shackles upon true genius, as to
render it servilely timorous, and check it's
enterprizing ardour? Let us endeavour to
give a satisfactory answer to these important
questions.</P>
<P>TASTE, though far from being generally
possessed, yet is by no means an arbitrary
thing. This is a truth acknowledged on all
sides, both by those who reduce <HI>taste</HI> to mere
feeling and perception, and by those also
who would bring it within the sphere of rea∣soning
and discussion. But we must observe
at the same time, that all the beauties and
perfections, which appear in the productions
of nature or of art, are not properly the ob∣jects
of <HI>taste,</HI> whose perceptions are less ex∣tensive
than many are apt to imagine. There
are certain charms of a sublime and striking
kind, which equally affect all observers, and
of which, consequently, all the various or¦ders
<PB N="227" REF="230"/>
of mankind, in all ages and nations of
the world, are competent judges. But there
is also another species of beauty, which only
affects those minds, that are possessed of a
certain delicacy of feeling, and which remains
imperceptible to vulgar spirits. The beauties
which belong to this class, are beauties only
of a second order; because objects, which
excite the idea of grandeur, surpass those
which affect us only by their gracefulness and
elegance. The charms however of this se∣cond
class of objects are those, which it re∣quires
the most sagacity to discern, and the
greatest delicacy to feel truly; and according∣ly
they abound most in those nations where
social intercourse has contributed to the per∣fection
of the arts, and multiplied the sources
of pleasure and enjoyment. It is then in
this class of beauty, which is adapted to the
contemplation of the discerning few, that we
are properly to look for the objects of <HI>taste.</HI>
These observations lead us naturally to define
<HI>taste,</HI> as the <HI>Faculty of distinguishing, in the
works of art, the various qualities which are
adapted to excite pleasure or disgust, in minds
that are susceptible of delicate sentiments and
perceptions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="231"/>
IF then <HI>taste</HI> be not an arbitrary thing, it
must be founded on fixed and evident princi∣ples,
by the application of which, we may
form a decisive judgment of all the various pro∣ductions
of art. The truth is, that the
source of our pleasures and of our disgusts
lies solely and intirely within ourselves; so
that, if we reflect with attention upon our
mental frame, we shall find there general
and invariable rules of <HI>taste,</HI> which will serve
as the criterion of beauty and deformity, in
all the objects, which the fecundity of the
different arts presents to our view. From
hence it follows, that the same philosophical
spirit, which obliges us, for want of sufficient
evidence, to suspend every moment our en∣quiries
about the nature and qualities of those
objects that are without us, ought, on the
contrary, to animate our researches with res∣pect
to the objects and the nature of <HI>taste,</HI>
which lies obvious to our examination, as
it exists within us, and constitutes a part of
our mental frame. The true philosopher
will, at the same time, easily perceive that
this examination must be confined within
proper limits. We must never, in our re∣searches
upon any subject, flatter ourselves
with the hopes of rising to <HI>First principles,</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="232"/>
which a thick veil perpetually conceals from
the eyes of mortals. To investigate the pri∣mitive
and metaphysical cause of our various
pleasures would be as chimerical a project,
as to attempt explaining the operation of ex∣ternal
objects upon our senses. But as the
origin of our knowledge has been reduced to
a small number of sensations; so the sources
of those pleasures, that are relative to <HI>taste,</HI>
may be traced out by a few evident observations
upon the manner in which we perceive and
feel. Thus far the true sage extends his re∣searches,
but here also he stops, and descends
from hence, as from first principles, to those
consequences that result from his accurate
observations.</P>
<P>IN analyzing <HI>taste</HI> we shall find many qua∣lities
necessary to the proper exercise of that
perceptive power which escape the notice of
inattentive observers. It does not consist
wholly in accuracy and rectitude of judg∣ment,
however rare and precious this quality
may be, nor yet in a delicate sensibility alone.
No: there is yet, farther, a considerable
assemblage of senses and powers (if I may so
speak) which enters into it's composition,
and which we must therefore carefully take
<PB N="230" REF="233"/>
into the account. A few examples will il∣lustrate
this observation. When we read a
sublime piece of poetry, what are the powers
and faculties of our nature to which the bard
addresses himself? They are various; some∣times
he speaks to our imagination, some∣times
to our affections, sometimes to our
reason, but always to the external sense or
organ of hearing. Verse is a species of har∣mony,
with respect to which the ear is too
delicate to admit of the least defect; so that
reason itself, upon some occasions, is obliged
to make certain sacrifices to rhime. A philo∣sopher
then, with all his penetration and de∣licacy
of sentiment, will be an incompetent
judge of poetry, if he has not a good ear.
He will assert that the pleasures which result
from poetick harmony are merely chimerical;
that all authors of whatever kind their pro∣ductions
may be, ought to address themselves
alone to the understanding and the heart;
nay, by captious reasonings he will cast an
apparent ridicule upon the care and industry,
which are employed in arranging words and
periods, so as to render them harmonious
and pleasing to the ear. Thus a natural
philosopher, who possessed no other external
<PB N="231" REF="234"/>
sense but that of <HI>feeling,</HI> would hold it as a
thing impossible, that distant objects should
operate upon our bodily organs, and would
prove his assertion by sophistical arguments,
to which no satisfactory answer could be gi∣ven,
as long as he was deprived of <HI>sight</HI> and
<HI>hearing.</HI> Such is the case of that philosopher,
who, without a delicate ear, pretends to
have a <HI>taste</HI> for poetry. He imagines he
does no real injury to a poem, when, by
transposing the words, he destroys their har∣mony
and cadence, and he will attribute the
languor and flatness, which the poem acquires
by this change, to the power of prejudice
and custom, to which he acknowledges his
own involuntary subjection. He will never
once imagine, that, by breaking the measure
and transposing the words, he has destroyed
the delightful harmony that resulted from
their metrical arrangement and proportions.
To judge however properly of such a conduct
we have only to ask ourselves, what we
should think of a musician, who, to prove
that the pleasure of melody is founded in
opinion and not in nature, should spoil a fine
air by destroying the proportion and symmetry
of the sounds, of which it was composed.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="235"/>
IT is not thus that the true philosopher
will judge of the pleasures that arise from po∣etry,
Avoiding wisely all extremes, he will
neither attribute them entirely to <HI>nature</HI> on
the one hand, nor wholly to <HI>opinion</HI> on the
other. He will observe, that, as all nations
are more or less agreeably affected with the
charms of musick in general, though they
may not all delight in the same particular
kinds of melody; so, in like manner, they
are all, in general, susceptible of pleasure
from poetick harmony, though the poetry of
one people may differ extremely from that of
another. It is by examining attentively this
difference, that the true sage will be able
at length to determine how far the pleasures
we receive from poetry and musick are in∣fluenced
by <HI>habit;</HI> what <HI>real</HI> additions they
derive from thence, and what <HI>imaginary</HI>
ones they receive from <HI>opinion.</HI> For he
will ever distinguish between that pleasure,
which is the result of habit, and that which
is arbitrary, and merely founded on opinion;
a distinction hitherto not sufficiently attended
to, in treating this subject, but which, not∣withstanding,
daily experience sufficiently
<PB N="233" REF="236"/>
justifies. There are certain pleasures that
strike us immediately, and that pervade the
soul the very moment that their objects are
presented; there are others, which require
time to produce their proper effect; which
are received with indifference or disgust, un∣til
the mind has been modified by their action
upon it to a certain degree, and are then en∣joyed
with the quickest sensations of delight.
How often has it happened, that a piece of
musick which we have heard, for the first
time, without any agreeable emotion, has
excited afterwards in us the most extatick
raptures, when, by it's being often repeated,
the ear has been at length able to distinguish
it's complicated charms, and to perceive
the whole delicacy and force of it's expressi∣on.</P>
<P>THIS is a striking instance of the pleasures
which arise from habit, and which must by
no means be looked upon as arbitrary, be∣cause
they may be, at first, received with
indifference, and have the force of prejudice
against them.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="237"/>
THUS a philosophical connoisseur will be
careful to maintain every faculty and every
sense in their respective privileges, and to at∣tribute
to a good ear the authority that be∣longs
to it, in deciding concerning the merit
of poetical compositions. But, at the same
time, he will be far from thinking, that the
poet's attention to please the external sense
can justify his dispensing with the more im∣portant
obligation of satisfying the reason and
imagination of his readers, by the justness of
his ideas, and the sublimity of his views. As
he is persuaded that the first and most im∣portant
rule of good writing requires a con∣formity
between the style of an author, and
the matter which he treats, so nothing will
disgust him more than common and trivial
ideas expressed with affectation, and adorned
with the vain pomp and harmony of poe∣try.
A plain and easy prose will, in his
opinion, be preferable to such numbers as
derive their principal merit from their ca∣dence,
and little or none from the truths
and sentiments which they are employed
to embellish and set off. Feelingly sensible
also of the charms of poetick imagery, he is,
on that very account, pleased with such ima∣ges
<PB N="235" REF="238"/>
alone, as are new and striking; and yet
even to these he will prefer, without hesita∣tion,
those beautiful sentiments which unfold,
in a noble and affecting manner, truths that
are useful to mankind.</P>
<P>IT must, however, be carefully observed,
that though a philosopher be possessed of all
that variety of senses and faculties that enter
into the composition of true <HI>taste,</HI> yet this is
not all that is required in the matter now
under consideration; it is farther necessary,
that the exercise of these faculties be not too
much confined to one particular set of objects.
The famous <HI>Malebranche</HI> could not read the
most sublime verses without a certain weari∣ness
and disgust; and yet his style abounds
with all the grand characters of poetry, and
is full of imagination, sentiment, and har∣mony;
but his imagination, entirely occupied
about matters purely intellectual, confined
it's energy to the creation of philosophical
systems; and the high degree of feeling and
vivacity with which he was endued, only
served to make him embrace with ardour, as
truth, what was no more than mere hypothe∣sis.
Though his prose was extremely har∣monious,
<PB N="236" REF="239"/>
yet poetical harmony had no charms
to him; which may perhaps be owing to one
of the following reasons: either that the sen∣sibility
of his ear was confined to the harmo∣ny
of prose; or that a mechanical and natu∣ral
talent enabled him to write harmonious
prose without his perceiving it, just as his
imagination had served him in philosophy
without his knowledge, or as a musical in∣strument
produces, without consciousness,
well-proportioned sounds.</P>
<P>IT is not only to a want of delicacy in the
mind, or of sensibility in the external organs
of perception, that we are to impute all er∣roneous
judgments in matters of <HI>taste.</HI> The
pleasure we receive from any excellent pro∣duction
of art, is, or may be derived from
different sources. The true philosophical
analysis consists therefore, in distinguishing
well these various sources, and keeping them
separate from each other, that so we may
refer to each what properly belongs to it,
and may not attribute our pleasures to causes
that have had no sort of influence in their
production. It has been observed, that the
rules of each art should be taken from the
<PB N="237" REF="240"/>
most excellent compositions which each res∣pective
art has furnished, and the observation
is undoubtedly just. It is not however by
the confused aggregate of pleasure, by the
collective result of the agreeable perceptions,
which these compositions have produced in us
that we are to fix the rules of <HI>taste;</HI> but by
that reflex act of the mind, which enables
us to distinguish the particular passages that
excited in us delightful sensations from those
which were only designed as shades in the
piece, or as resting places for the exhausted
attention of the reader, and also from those
where the author has exhibited marks of in∣voluntary
negligence. For want of observing
this method the imagination warmed by cer∣tain
beauties of the noblest kind, which may
shine forth in a work, otherwise full of the
most monstrous defects, will gradually become
insensible of these defects; nay, will trans∣form
them into beauties, and conduct us at
length to that stupid enthusiasm, which, by
admiring every thing indiscriminately, per∣ceives,
or rather feels nothing truly. Thus
by a confused and mechanical impression,
many will be led either to establish false rules
of <HI>taste,</HI> or, what is equally pernicious, to
<PB N="238" REF="241"/>
substitute arbitrary notions in the place of
fixed principles; to contract the sphere of the
arts; to prescribe bounds to our pleasures in
order to render them insipidly uniform, and
to confine the efforts of genius and industry
within a narrow circle.</P>
<P>IT is the province of philosophy to break
these inglorious bonds asunder; but she can∣not
be too circumspect in the choice of the
arms, by which this noble deliverance is
to be accomplished. The late Mons. <HI>De
la motte</HI> maintained that versication was not
essential to dramatical compositions; but to
prove an opinion so susceptible of a rational
defence, he injudiciously launched into para∣dox,
wrote against poetry in general, and
thereby did nothing but injury to his cause:
he might as well have wrote against musick
of every kind, in order to prove, that the cho∣rus
is not essential to tragedy. This ingenious
writer was under no necessity of combating
the prejudices of the publick against his opini∣on,
by such senseless paradoxes. There was,
methinks, a much shorter way of proving his
point, and that was, to have composed his
celebrated tragedy of <HI>Inés de Castro</HI> in prose,
<PB N="239" REF="242"/>
the affecting nature of a subject so tenderly
interesting, should have encouraged him to
venture upon this innovation, and thus the
theatre would have been enriched with a new
species of dramatick poetry. But an ambi∣tious
desire of being distinguished from the
crowd leads men sometimes to combat, in
theory, received opinions, while a timorous
self-love, that dreads all new and dangerous
attempts through the apprehension of mis∣carrying,
obliges them to follow those very
opinions in practice. It is here that we may
observe a considerable difference between the
philosopher and the legislator; the latter dis∣penses,
in his private conduct, with the laws
which he imposes upon others; while the
philosopher observes in his work, the rules
which he condemns in his preface.</P>
<P>THE two sources of error which we have
been hitherto considering, <HI>viz.</HI> the want of
sensibility, on the one hand, and the want of
that reflexion, which is requisite to distin∣guish
the true causes of our pleasures, on the
other, will be the occasion of perpetuating
that tedious controversy, so often renewed,
and so injudiciously carried on, the merit of
<PB N="240" REF="243"/>
the ancients. Their advocates, under the
impulse of an enthusiastick admiration, are
too prone to exalt their productions upon the
whole, on account of the striking beau∣ties
that appear in some of the parts; while
their adversaries refuse those applauses that
are due to the parts, on account of the defects
that appear in the whole.</P>
<P>THERE is however another error, into
which the philosophical critick is more liable
to fall, and to avoid which, he must conse∣quently
employ his principal attention. This
error consists in applying to the peculiar objects
of <HI>taste,</HI> principles, which, though true in
themselves, yet have no relation to these ob∣jects.
Every one is acquainted with those
lines in the tragedy of the <HI>Horatii,</HI></P>
<Q><L>Que vouliez vous qu'il fit contre trois? Qu'il mourut.</L>
<L>Ou qu'un beau desespoir alors le securût<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To enable those, who don't understand the <HI>French</HI> lan∣guage, to enter into the true spirit of this ingenious criticism, it will be proper to observe, that in <HI>Corneille's</HI> tragedy of the <HI>Horatii,</HI> a messenger arrives to inform the old <HI>Horatius,</HI> that two of his sons were killed, and that the third was flying from the three <HI>Curiatii.</HI> The venerable old man is filled with in∣dignation at the conduct of his remaining son. The messenger to excuse him, addresses himself thus to the incensed father: <HI>What other resource had be than flight, overpowered as he was by three combatants? A glorious death</HI> (replies the old <HI>Hora∣tius) or that succour that is administred by a noble despair.</HI> These words <HI>A glorious death,</HI> which are equivalent to <HI>Qu'il mourut,</HI> conclude the first line in the <HI>French,</HI> and give us a striking instance of the true sublime. What follows is censured by Mr. <HI>D' Alembert</HI> for the excellent reasons offered in his elegant observations on this passage.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>The heroick expression of the aged father
<HI>Qu'il mourut,</HI> has been justly and universally
<PB N="241" REF="244"/>
admired; and the following verse as justly
and universally condemned; and yet the
common principles of metaphysicks will fur∣nish
arguments or rather sophisms, to justify
this verse against all the rules of true <HI>taste.</HI>
It will be alledged, for instance, that this se∣cond
verse is necessary to express all the feel∣ings
that passed in the mind of the old <HI>Hora∣tius;</HI>
for though it was his duty to prefer the
death of his son to a life of dishonour; yet it
was still more natural to wish that his son
might escape by the means of his valour, and
that, animated by a <HI>noble despair,</HI> he might
stand alone against his three adversaries, and
return victorious from the combat. This
defence, however plausible upon metaphysi∣cal
principles, is absolutely misapplied in the
<PB N="242" REF="245"/>
case before us, where the question is not
concerning the mere expression of truth and
nature, but concerning such expressions of
both as are striking and sublime. According
to the reasoning of the metaphysical critick,
the second verse, as it contains the sentiment
that is the most natural of the two, should
have preceded the first, which, by that means,
would have lost the greatest part of it's force.
Besides; nothing more feeble, flat, and fri∣gid
than this second verse, even when res∣tored
to it's true and natural place. For
where is the necessity for the old <HI>Horatius's</HI>
expressing the desire which that verse con∣tains?
Will not every one suppose, without
difficulty, that it would have been infinitely
more rejoicing to him to have seen his son
living, and crowned with victory, than fal∣ling
a victim to the superior force of his ene∣mies?
The poet then had no occasion to ex∣press
a desire which every one must suppose:
the only sentiment which suited that violent
state of emotion in which the venerable old
man now was, the only affection which was
proper to be discovered upon such an occasion,
and in circumstances where the glory of his
country and of his name were immediately
<PB N="243" REF="246"/>
concerned, was that heroick courage, which
engaged him to choose for his son a noble
death rather than a life of dishonour and in∣famy.
The cold and tardy reasonings of
slow and phlegmatick spirits are very different
from the sudden and prodigious bounds,
which minds, nobly fired, make towards
the true sublime; the latter, disdaining to
remain, even for a moment, in the sphere
of vulgar sentiments, understand much more
than they express, and soar with a rapid
flight to those sentiments and passions that
carry the strongest marks of energy and
grandeur. Their progress resembles that of
one of <HI>Homer's</HI> gods, whose fourth stride
brought him from one end of the universe to
the other.</P>
<P>THUS then it happens, that, in matters of
<HI>taste,</HI> the demi-philosopher (if I may employ
that term) leads us from the paths of truth
and nature, to which it is the province of
true philosophy to restore our wandering steps.
It is therefore an injury done both to the
Belles Lettres and to Philosophy, to imagine
that they are either incompatible with, or pre∣judicial
to each other. Whatever relates to
<PB N="244" REF="247"/>
our ideas and perceptions, and even to our
sentiments and feelings, is the true domain,
the proper sphere of philosophy. It would
therefore be as unreasonable to confine her
to the heavenly bodies, or to the material
system of the universe, as it would be to limit
poetry to the praises of the gods, or the
pleasures of love. The true spirit of philo∣sophy
is so far from being in opposition to
<HI>taste,</HI> that it is, on the contrary, it's most
solid support, as it teaches us always to set
out from true and evident principles, to ob∣serve
that every art has it's peculiar nature,
every situation and affection of the mind it's
proper character, and every object it's distinct∣ive
colouring, and thus prevents our con∣founding
the limits by which the various
kinds are so carefully distinguished. Such
is the nature, excellence, and power of the
philosophical spirit, the abuse of which,
shews that it is not truly possessed.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked by some, that the
submitting the objects of <HI>taste</HI> to analytical
discussion is adapted to blunt the delicacy of
the feeling powers, and to damp the fire and
vigour of genius. But this effect is not to be
<PB N="245" REF="248"/>
feared. The true philosopher knows that
in the moment when genius creates and in∣vents,
it will not admit of the least check
or restraint; that it loves to rush forward
without controul and without rule, to produce
indiscriminately the monstrous and the sub∣lime,
and to carry down it's rapid stream
gold and mud mingled together by the impe∣tuosity
of it's course. Reason, therefore,
gives to genius, while it creates a boundless
liberty, and even permits it to continue it's
career until it exhausts it's vigour and sinks
down to repose, like those firey coursers,
which it is impossible to tame any other way
than by throwing the bridle upon their necks.
But then it is the time for reason to exercise
it's authority, and to sit in judgment upon
the productions of genius. Accordingly, it
preserves whatever was the off-spring of a
true and noble enthusiasm, effaces, on the
contrary, whatever was produced by the ir∣regular
sallies of an over-heated imagination,
and thus enriches the republick of letters
with masterly performances in all the various
kinds. Where is the writer of genius and
<HI>taste,</HI> who does not perceive in the heat of
composition, that one part of his mind (if I
<PB N="246" REF="249"/>
may so express myself) separates itself from
the other which is employed in composing,
in order to observe it's motions, and to give
them a free course, and also points out before
hand what is afterwards to be effaced?</P>
<P>THE true philosopher uses much the same
method in judging of the productions of
others, that he employs in composing his
own. He begins by giving himself up to the
high and lively sensations of pleasure, which
generally arise from the first impression that
a new and masterly performance makes upon
the mind. Persuaded however, that real
beauties gain in proportion as they are atten∣tively
examined, he recollects himself; ex∣tends
his researches to the causes of his satis∣faction;
singles them out one after another;
distinguishes carefully between illusory sensa∣tions,
and deep and lasting impressions; and
by this analytical procedure is rendered capa∣ble
of pronouncing with judgment concern∣ing
the merit of a work in general, and of
each of it's particular and constituent parts.</P>
<P>FROM these observations we shall be fur∣nished
with an answer to a question, which
<PB N="247" REF="250"/>
has been often proposed, and also much de∣bated,
<HI>viz.</HI> Whether, in judging concerning
a work of <HI>taste,</HI> sentiment or feeling is to be
preferred before reasoning and discussion?
<HI>Feeling</HI> is undoubtedly the natural judge for
the first moment, <HI>Discussion</HI> for the second,
and the second judge will, almost always,
confirm the decisions of the first in those
persons, who, with a quick and delicate
sense of beauty, are so happy as to possess a
just and accurate discernment. But the dif∣ficulty,
it will be alledged, still remains;
for as sentiment and discussion will not always
be agreed, what must be done when they
differ? Is it not best in all cases to follow
sentiment as our guide, and hold always by
it's decision? Is it not a miserable occupation,
will many ask, to be disputing against our
agreeable sensations, and what obligations
shall we lie under to philosophy if it mani∣festly
tend to diminish our pleasures? We
cannot answer this latter question without
the utmost regret; because we are obliged
to acknowledge the effect of philosophy to
be, in reality, what it is here represented to
be.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="251"/>
SUCH is the unhappy lot of humanity,
that the knowledge we acquire serves only
to give us a mortifying view of the scenes of
error and illusion, through which we have
passed, and is, almost always, attended with
the diminution of our pleasures. The rude
simplicity of our ancestors rendered the im∣pressions
they received from the monstrous
productions of the ancient theatre, more live∣ly
and striking than those which we receive,
in this polished age, from the most perfect
of our dramatick performances. The nations,
which we surpass in knowledge and in re∣finement,
are not less happy than we are;
since both their desires and their wants are
less numerous than ours, and they are satis∣fied
with pleasures of a less elegant kind,
than those which we pursue. We should
not, however, be willing to exchange our
knowledge for the ignorance of those nations,
or for the rude simplicity of our ancestors.
For, though this knowledge may diminish
our pleasures, yet it flatters our vanity. We
applaud ourselves on account of that delicacy
and refinement, that render us difficult to be
pleased, and even look upon them as merito∣rious.
<PB N="249" REF="252"/>
Self-love is the reigning passion, and
that which, generally speaking, we are the
most eager to gratify. The pleasure we de∣rive
from thence, is not, like many others,
the effect of a sudden and violent impression;
it is uniform and permanent, and may there∣fore
be enjoyed at leisure.</P>
<P>THESE reflexions, methinks, will be es∣teemed
sufficient to justify philosophy from
the accusations that have been brought against
it by ignorance and envy. We cannot how∣ever
conclude without observing, that even
upon the supposition that these accusations
and reproaches were just, yet they lose their
influence, and become unseemly, when they
are not made by philosophers themselves. To
them alone it belongs to determine the sphere,
and to fix the boundaries of the philosophical
spirit; as it belongs only to those who have
wit, to plead against the abuse that may be
made of it. But it unluckily happens, in op∣position
to this rule, that those who have the
least acquaintance with philosophy are its most
violent detracters; just as poetry is decried by
such as have no talent for that noble art; the
<PB N="250" REF="253"/>
profound sciences, by such as are ignorant
of their first principles; and the age we live
in, by those writers, whose productions
are the most adapted to expose it to con∣tempt.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A FRAGMENT found imperfect among the

<P>THE constitution of human nature in
it's present state, opens to the mind
three different sources of pleasure; one in
it's internal faculties and essence, another in
it's union with the body, and a third in those
impressions and prejudices, that are the result
of certain institutions, customs, and habits.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="257"/>
THESE different pleasures of the mind
constitute the proper objects of <HI>taste,</HI> those
objects which we term beautiful, good,
agreeable, natural, delicate, tender, grace∣ful,
elegant, noble, grand, sublime, and
majestick, as also the qualities to which we
give the name of <HI>Je ne sçai quoi.</HI> When,
for instance, the pleasure we enjoy in the
contemplation of any object is accompanied
with a notion of it's utility to us, we call that
object <HI>good;</HI> but when an object appears
merely agreeable, without being advantageous,
we then term it <HI>beautiful.</HI></P>
<P>THE ancients do not seem to have fully
apprehended this important distinction; they
considered as things of a <HI>positive</HI> nature those
qualities, or rather perceptions, which are
merely <HI>relative</HI> to the nature and operations
of the soul. Hence, those dialogues so ce∣lebrated
by the ancients, in which <HI>Plato</HI> gives
us an ample account of the reasonings of his
great master, are, in our times, unsuscepti∣ble
of a rational defence, because they are
founded upon the principles of a false phi∣losophy.
All the reasonings they contain
<PB N="259" REF="258"/>
concerning goodness, beauty, perfection,
wisdom, folly, hardness, softness, &amp;c. are
intirely inconclusive<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This observation is intirely erroneous; for granting <HI>goodness, beauty, hard, soft,</HI> &amp;c. to be merely perceptions of the mind, and nothing really existing <HI>without us;</HI> yet if these perceptions be invariably excited by certain objects and not by others, if they arise uniformly when these objects are presented, they form, of consequence, fixed and permanent relations, which render all the reasonings founded on them as conclusive, as if these perceptions were the inherent qualities of external objects. The translator thought this error of too much con∣sequence to pass it over in silence.</NOTE>, as they suppose these
various perceptions to be what they are not,
real and positive qualities.</P>
<P>THE sources, therefore, of beauty, good∣ness,
&amp;c. lie within us, and, of consequence,
when we enquire into their causes, we do no
more than investigate the springs of our men∣tal
pleasures.</P>
<P>LET us then turn the eye of the mind up∣on
itself, examine it's inward frame, consi∣der
it in it's actions, and it's passions, and
contemplate it in it's pleasures in which it's
true nature is best discovered. It derives
pleasure from poetry, painting, sculpture,
architecture, musick, dancing, in a word,
<PB N="260" REF="259"/>
from the various productions of nature and
art. Let us, therefore, inquire into the
reasons that render these objects pleasing, as
also into the manner of their operation, and
the times and circumstances in which they
produce their agreeable effects, and thus give
an account of our various feelings. This
will contribute to the formation of <HI>taste,</HI>
which is nothing more than the faculty of
discovering with quickness and delicacy the
degree of pleasure, which we should receive
from each object that comes within the sphere
of our perceptions.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the pleasures of the mind.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind, besides those pleasures which
it receives by the organs of sense, enjoys
others which are peculiar to it's spiritual na∣ture,
and are absolutely independent on ex∣ternal
sensation. Such are the pleasures that
arise from curiosity, from the ideas of it's
own existence, grandeur and perfections,
from the faculty of taking a general and com∣prehensive
view of things, of contemplating
a great variety of objects, and of comparing,
combining and separating it's own ideas.
<PB N="261" REF="260"/>
These pleasures, which are attached to the
nature of every intelligent being, depend not
upon the external senses, but reside in the ve∣ry
essence of the soul; and it is needless to
inquire whether the soul enjoys them, in
consequence of it's union with the body, or
not; all that is necessary for us to know is,
that it enjoys them always, and that they are
the true and proper objects of <HI>taste.</HI> We
shall not, therefore, take any notice here of
the distinction that may be made between
the pleasures that the soul derives from it's
own essence, and those that result from it's
union with the body, but shall comprehend
both these kinds of enjoyment under the com∣mon
name of <HI>natural pleasures.</HI> These plea∣sures
we must, however, distinguish from
others that have certain connexions with them,
and which we may call <HI>acquired pleasures.</HI>
In the same manner, and also for the same
reasons, we distinguish between the <HI>taste</HI>
which is <HI>natural,</HI> and that which is <HI>ac∣quired.</HI></P>
<P>IT is of great use in researches of this
kind to know the source of those pleasures of
which <HI>taste</HI> is the rule or measure: Since the
<PB N="262" REF="261"/>
knowledge of our pleasures, whether <HI>natural</HI>
or <HI>acquired,</HI> will contribute much towards
the rectifying the two kinds of <HI>taste</HI> that cor∣respond
to them. We cannot truely appre∣ciate
our pleasures, nor indeed enjoy them
with a proper relish, if we do not carefully
examine the nature of those pleasures, and
their first springs in the human constitution.</P>
<P>IF our souls had not been united to mate∣rial
substances, they would still have been
capable of knowledge, but it is probable they
would have loved whatever they knew;
whereas, in the present constitution of things,
we scarcely love any thing but that of which
we are ignorant.</P>
<P>THE constitution of our nature is an arbi∣trary
thing; we might have been otherwise
constituted than we are at present; and, in
that case, our perceptions and feelings would
have been quite different from what they
now are. An external organ of sensation
more or less would have given rise to a spec∣ies
of poetry and eloquence totally different
from that which takes place at present; nay,
even another contexture of the organs we
<PB N="263" REF="262"/>
possess would have changed vastly the nature
of poetry; for instance, Had the constitution
of our mental and bodily powers rendered
our attention and application of mind more
vigorous and constant than what they are at
present, this circumstance would have pre∣vented
the existence of those rules, which
are designed to adapt the disposition of a sub∣ject
to that measure of attention of which we
are capable: Had we been naturally endowed
with a more perfect degree of sagacity and
penetration, all the rules which are founded
upon the degree which we now possess,
must have been entirely different: In a word,
all the laws that derive their existence and au∣thority
from a certain constitution of our na∣ture,
would have been totally different, upon
the supposition of it's being otherwise consti∣tuted.</P>
<P>IF the sense of fight had been more feeble
and confused than it actually is, it would
have been necessary to have introduced into
the plans of the architect fewer ornaments,
and more uniformity; but the contrary rule
must have taken place had our fight been
more distinct, piercing, and comprehensive.
<PB N="264" REF="263"/>
Had our sense of hearing been constituted like
those of many other animals, the most of our
musical instruments would have required a
quite different construction and modulation.
It is true the relations of things to each other
would have still continued the same, let the
construction of our organs have been ever so
different from what it now is; but their re∣lation
to us being totally changed, they would
not have produced in us the effects they now
produce. And as the persection of the arts
consists in their presenting to us their respec∣tive
objects in such a manner as will render
them as agreeable and striking as is possible;
so a different constitution of our nature from
the present, would, necessarily, require a
change in the present state of the arts adapted
to the change which that new constitution
would occasion in the means of enjoyment,
in the manner of being agreeably affected.</P>
<P>WE are, at first fight, prone enough to
imagine that a knowledge of the various
sources of our pleasures is sufficient in order
to the attainment of what is called <HI>taste,</HI> and
that the man who has studied the dictates of
philosophy upon this subject is a man of <HI>taste.</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="264"/>
and may judge with confidence concerning
all the productions of nature and art. But
this is a mistake: for the <HI>natural taste</HI> does
not consist in a theoretick knowledge, but in
the quick and exquisite application of rules
which, in speculation, may be really unknown
to the mind. It is not, for example, neces∣sary
to know that the pleasure we receive
from a certain object which we call beautiful
is the effect of surprize; it is enough that
the object produces it's effect, and surprises
neither more nor less than is expedient for that
purpose.</P>
<P>ALL, therefore, that can be said upon the
subject before us, and all the precepts that we
can lay down for forming our <HI>taste,</HI> can only
regard directly that <HI>taste</HI> that is to be acqui∣red,
though they have a distant and indirect
relation to the <HI>natural</HI> one. This indirect re∣lation
is manifest; for the <HI>acquired taste</HI> af∣fects,
changes, augments and diminishes the
<HI>natural</HI> one, just as the former is affected,
changed, augmented and diminished by the
latter.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="265"/>
THE most general definition that can be
given of <HI>taste,</HI> considered antecedently to it's
division into good and bad, is, that it is some∣thing
which attaches us to certain objects by
the power of an internal sense, or feeling.
This account, however, does not suppose that
it may not be applied to intellectual things,
the knowledge of which is so delightful to the
mind, that it has been looked upon by some
philosophers as the only source of true felici∣ty.
The soul acquires knowledge by it's ideas
and it's inward senses or feelings<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">There is a good deal of difficulty in translating the <HI>French</HI> word <HI>sentiment</HI> by any other term than that of <HI>feeling.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> word <HI>sentiment</HI> in the singular number may be used methinks to render the <HI>French</HI> term, and I have ventured to apply it several times in this sense, leaving out the particle <HI>a,</HI> which attaches to it another meaning in our language. But in the plural number we can scarcely make the same use of it, as by <HI>sentiments,</HI> we commonly understand our thoughts and opinions.</NOTE>; and it's
pleasures spring from the same sources: for
though the later be generally considered as the
inlets of pleasure, and we suppose a total dif∣ference

certain that the soul <HI>feels</HI> whatever it <HI>perceives,</HI>

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning curiosity.</HEAD>
<P>THE human mind is naturally formed
for thinking or perceiving, and <HI>curiosity</HI> is ne∣cessary
to such a being: for as all things are
connected in nature, and every idea and object
are in the great chain of being immediately
preceded by their causes, and as immediately
followed by their effects, so we cannot desire
the knowledge of one object without being
desirous also of arriving at the knowledge of
those that are intimately related to it. Thus
when we see the part only of an excellent
piece of painting, we are eagerly desirous of
a sight of what remains concealed from our
view, and the eagerness of this desire is pro∣portioned
to the pleasure we received from
what we had already seen.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="268"/>
IT is, therefore, the pleasure which we have
received from one object, that carries forward
our desires towards another; hence the mind
is always bent upon the pursuit of something
new, and never enjoys a permanent repose.</P>
<P>THUS may we always be sure of adminis∣tring
pleasure to the mind, by presenting to
its contemplation a multitude of objects, or
even, a greater number than it expected to
see.</P>
<P>By these observations we may be enabled
to explain the reason, why we receive plea∣sure
both from the view of a regular garden,
and also from a rural prospect, in which there
is neither order nor proportion. The plea∣sure
we receive from these different objects
arises originally from the same cause, even
from the natural desire we have of seeing a
multitude of objects. This desire renders us
eager to extend our views, and to wander
from place to place; the mind, under it's im∣pulse,
abhors all limits, and would willingly
enlarge the sphere of its contemplation, and
even of it's actual presence; and thus one of
it's great pleasures is, to take in a large and
distant prospect. But this pleasure is not ea∣sily
<PB N="270" REF="269"/>
attained: in towns and cities our view is
obstructed by various ranges of buildings; in
the country it is limited and interrupted by
many obstacles. What then is to be done?
Why, we must have recourse to art, which
comes to our assistance, and discloses nature
which was concealed from our sight; in this
case we are more pleased with art, than with
nature, that is to say, with nature veiled and
unseen. But when nature presents itself to
us in extensive prospects, in variegated land∣scapes,
where the eye can roam uncontrouled
through meadows and woods, through rising
grounds and flowery plains, the mind is quite
otherwise elated and transported with these
rural scenes, than with the gardens of <HI>Le No∣tre;</HI>
because such is the fecundity of nature,
that it is always new and original, whereas
art copies and resembles itself in all its pro∣ductions.
This also is the reason why in
painting we are more pleased with a rural
landscape, than with a correct plan of the
finest garden upon the earth; because the
painter represents nature in those scenes, where
she appears with the greatest beauty, with
the most striking variety, where the eye can
<PB N="271" REF="270"/>
ramble at liberty, and behold her in all her
charms with pleasure and delight.</P>
<P>THAT which, generally speaking, renders
a thought grand and striking, is when the ob∣ject
it represents opens to our view a multi∣tude
of other objects with which it is con∣nected,
so that we discover of a sudden, and,
as it were, instantaneously what we had no
hopes of knowing without a considerable de∣gree
of attention and application.</P>
<P>FLORUS <HI>expresses, in these few words,
all the faults of</HI> Hannibal: cum victoriâ pos∣set
uti, frui maluit.</P>
<P>HE gives, us an idea of the whole <HI>Macedo∣nian</HI>
war, when he says: <HI>introisse victoria fuit.</HI></P>
<P>He exhibits to us a striking and sublime
view of the whole life and exploits of <HI>Scipio,</HI>
when he speaks thus concerning his youth;
<HI>hic erit</HI> Scipio, <HI>qui in exitium</HI> Africae <HI>crescit.</HI></P>
<P>HE paints, in the most lively colours, the
restless spirit of <HI>Hannibal,</HI> the state of the na∣tions,
<PB N="272" REF="271"/>
and the whole grandeur of the <HI>Roman</HI>
people, when he says: <HI>qui profugus ex</HI> Afri∣câ,
<HI>hostem populo</HI> Romano <HI>toto orbe quaerebat.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the pleasures, which arise
from order.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not sufficient to exhibit to the mind
a multiplicity of objects; it is farther requi∣site
that they be exhibited with order and ar∣rangement,
for then it retains what it has
seen, and also forms to itself some notion of
what is to follow. One of the highest men∣tal
pleasures is that which we receive from a
consciousness of the extent of our views, and
the depth of our penetration; but in a produc∣tion
void of order this pleasure is impeded;
the mind, desirous to supply from its own
ideas this want of regularity, is perplexed in
the vain attempt; it's plan mingles itself with
that which the author of the work had form∣ed,
and this produces a new confusion. It re∣tains
nothing, foresees nothing; it is dejected
by the confusion that reigns in it's ideas, and
by the comfortless void that succeeds the abun∣dance
and variety of it's vain recources. It's fa∣tigue
is without it's effect, and efforts are unsuc∣cessful.
<PB N="273" REF="272"/>
Hence the judicious artist always in∣troduces
a certain order, even amidst confusion,
where confusion is not the main object, the
principal thing to be expressed. Hence the
painter throws his figures into groups; and
when he draws a battle, represents, as it were,
in the front of his piece, the principal objects
which the eye is to distinguish, and casts at a
distance, by the magick of perspective, the
groups where confusion and disorder reign.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the pleasure that arises from
variety.</HEAD>
<P>IF order be thus necessary in all sorts of
productions, <HI>variety</HI> is no less so; without
<HI>variety</HI> the mind falls into a lifeless inactivity
and languor; for similar objects appear to it
as if they were wholly the same; so that if
a part of a piece of painting was disclosed to
our view, which carried a striking resemblance
of another part of the same piece that we had
already seen, this second part would be real∣ly
a new object without appearing such, and
would be contemplated without the least sen∣sation
<PB N="274" REF="273"/>
of pleasure. The beauties we discern
in the productions of art, as well as in the
works of nature, consisting entirely in the
pleasure they administer, it is necessary so to
modify these beauties as to render them the
means of diversifying our pleasures as far as
is possible. We must employ our industry
in offering to the eye of the mind objects
which it has not as yet seen, and in exciting
within it feelings different from those which
it may have already experienced.</P>
<P>THUS History pleases by the variety of
facts and relations which it contains; Ro∣mance
by the variety of prodigies it invents;
and Dramatic Poetry by the variety of passions
which it excites. Thus also they who are
well versed in the art of education endeavour
to introduce as much diversity as they can
amidst that tedious uniformity which is inse∣parable
from a long course of instruction.</P>
<P>UNIFORMITY carried on to a certain
length renders every thing insupportable. The
same arrangement of periods continued for a
long time fatigues in a piece of eloquence.
The same numbers and cadences become ex∣tremely
<PB N="275" REF="274"/>
tedious in a long poem. If the ac∣counts
given of the famous <HI>Vista</HI> or alley that
extends from <HI>Moscow</HI> to <HI>Petersburg</HI> be true,
the traveller, pent up between these two
seemingly endless rows of trees, must feel the
most disagreeable lassitude and satiety in the
continuance of such a dull uniformity. Nay,
even prospects which have the charm of <HI>va∣riety,</HI>
cease to please, if they be repeated with∣out
much alteration, and are for a long time
present to the mind. Thus the traveller, who
has been long wandering through the <HI>Alps,</HI>
will descend satiated with the most extensive
views, the most romantick and delightful
landscapes.</P>
<P>THE human mind loves <HI>variety,</HI> and the
reason is, as we have already observed, that it
is naturally framed for contemplation and
knowledge. If then the love of variety is
subordinate and adapted to the attainment of
knowledge, it is requisite, that variety, whe∣ther
in the productions of nature or art, be
such as will facilitate knowledge; or, in other
words, an object must be sufficiently <HI>simple</HI>
to be perceived with ease, and sufficiently <HI>di∣versified</HI>
to be contemplated with pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="275"/>
THERE are certain objects, which have the
appearance of variety, without the reality; and
others, that seem to be uniform, but are, in
effect, extremely diversified.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Gothic</HI> architecture appears extremely
rich in point of variety, but it's ornaments fa∣tigue
the eye by their confusion and minute∣ness.
Hence we cannot easily distinguish one
from the other, nor fix our attention upon any
one object, on account of the multitude that
rush at once upon the sight; and thus it hap∣pens
that this kind of architecture displeases
in the very circumstances that were designed
to render it agreeable.</P>
<P>A <HI>Gothic</HI> structure is to the eye what a rid∣dle
is to the understanding; in the contem∣plation
of it's various parts and ornaments the
mind perceives the same perplexity and con∣fusion
in it's ideas, that arise from reading an
obscure poem.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Grecian</HI> architecture, on the contra∣ry,
appears uniform; but as the nature, and
the number also of it's divisions are precisely
<PB N="277" REF="276"/>
such as occupy the mind without fatiguing
it, it has consequently that degree of <HI>variety,</HI>
that is pleasing and delightful.</P>
<P>GREATNESS in the <HI>whole</HI> of any produc∣tion
requires of necessity the same quality in
the <HI>parts.</HI> Gigantic bodies must have bulky
members; large trees must have large bran∣ches,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such is the nature of things.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Grecian</HI> architecture, whose divisions
are few, but grand and noble, seems formed
after the model of the great and the sublime.
The mind perceives a certain majesty which
reigns through all it's productions.</P>
<P>THUS the painter distributes the figures,
that are to compose his work, into various
groups; and in this he follows nature and
truth, for a crowd is almost always divided
into separate companies. In the same man∣ner
in every complex piece of painting we see
the lights and shades distributed into large
masses, which strike the eye at a distance, be∣fore
the whole composition is distinctly per∣ceived.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="278" REF="277"/>
<HEAD>Concerning the pleasure that arises from
symmetry.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already observed that variety is
pleasing to the human mind; and we must
farther remark, that a certain degree of <HI>sym∣metry</HI>
produces also an agreeable effect, and
contributes to the beauty of the greatest part
of those complex productions, which we be∣hold
with admiration and delight. How
shall we reconcile this seeming contradiction!
It will vanish if we attend to the following
observations.</P>
<P>ONE of the principal causes of the pleasure,
which the mind receives in the contemplation
of the various objects that are presented to it,
is the facility with which it perceives them.
Hence <HI>symmetry</HI> is rendered agreeable, as it's
similar arrangements relieve the mind, aid the
quickness of it's comprehension, and enable it,
upon a view of the one half of an object, to
form immediately an idea of the whole.</P>
<P>UPON this observation is founded the fol∣lowing
general rule, That where <HI>symmetry</HI> is
<PB N="279" REF="278"/>
thus useful to the mind, by aiding it's com∣prehension,
and facilitating it's operations and
it's perceptions, there it is, and must always
be agreeable; but where it does not produce
this effect, it becomes flat and insipid, because,
without any good purpose, it deprives an ob∣ject
of that <HI>variety</HI> to which nature has given
superior charms. In those objects which are
viewed successively, <HI>variety</HI> is requisite, be∣cause
they are distinctly perceived without the
least difficulty. On the contrary, where a
multitude of objects are presented to us in one
point of view, and rush in at once upon the
eye, there <HI>symmetry</HI> is necessary to aid us in¦forming
quickly an idea of the whole. Thus
<HI>symmetry</HI> is observed in the front of a build∣ing,
in a parterre, in a temple; and there it
pleases extremely for the reason now men∣tioned,
it's aiding the mind to take in imme∣diately
the whole object without pain, per∣plexity,
or confusion.</P>
<P>THE object which the mind views not
successively, but, as it were, by one effort,
must be <HI>simple</HI> and <HI>one;</HI> all it's parts must
unite in forming one design, and must relate
to one end. This is another consideration,
<PB N="280" REF="279"/>
that renders <HI>symmetry</HI> pleasing, as it alone
properly constitutes what we call a <HI>whole,</HI> or
the effect of a variety of parts that center in
one general design.</P>
<P>THERE is yet another consideration that
pleads in favour of <HI>symmetry,</HI> and that is the
desire, so natural to the mind, of seeing every
thing finished and brought to perfection. In
all complex objects there must be a sort of
counterbalance, or equilibrium between the
various parts that terminate in one <HI>whole;</HI> and
an edifice only with one wing, or with one
wing shorter than the other, would be as un∣finished
and imperfect a production as a body
with only one arm, or with two of unequal
length.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning contrasts.</HEAD>
<P>IF the mind takes pleasure in <HI>symmetry,</HI> it
is also agreeably affected by <HI>contrasts.</HI> This
requires explication, and a few examples will
serve for that purpose.</P>
<P>IF painters and sculptors, in obedience to
the directions of nature, are careful to observe
<PB N="281" REF="280"/>
a certain symmetry in their compositions; the
same nature requires that the attitudes which
they represent should contrast each other; and
thus exhibit an agreeable variety, a pleasing
opposition to the eye of the spectator. One
foot placed precisely in the same position with
the other, or any two of the corresponding
parts of the body placed exactly in the same
direction, disgust a judicious observer, because
this studied symmetry produces a perpetual
and insipid sameness of attitude, such as we
observe in the <HI>Gothic</HI> figures, which all re∣semble
each other in this respect. Besides,
this uniformity of attitude is contrary to our
natural frame and constitution; nature has
not designed that we should imitate in our
gestures the stupid uniformity that is obser∣vable
in the <HI>Indian</HI> Pagods: no; she has
given us the power of self-motion and con∣sequently
the liberty of modifying our air and
our posture as we please. And if stiffness and
affectation be unsupportable in the human
form, can they be pleasing in the productions
of art?</P>
<P>THE attitudes therefore, particularly of
such figures as are represented in sculpture,
<PB N="282" REF="281"/>
must be contrasted in order to give them an
agreeable air of variety and ease. What ren∣ders
this more especially necessary in sculp∣ture
is, that of all the arts it is naturally the
most cold and lifeless, and can only affect
and enflame by the force of it's contrasts and
the boldness of it's postures.</P>
<P>BUT as, according to an observation al∣ready
made, the variety which the <HI>Gothic</HI>
architects were studious to introduce into
their structures gave them an insipid air of
uniformity; so has it happened that the va∣riety,
which other artists proposed effectua∣ting
by the means of contrasts, has degene∣rated
also into a vicious symmetry.</P>
<P>THIS is not only observable in certain
productions of sculptors and painters, but al∣so
in the style of certain authors, who, by
perpetual antitheses form a contrast between
the beginning and the end of each phrase.
Of this we find several examples in <HI>St. Augus∣tin,</HI>
and others, who wrote during the low
periods of the <HI>Latin</HI> language; and also in
the writings of several moderns, particularly
those of <HI>St. Evremont.</HI> The same cadence
<PB N="283" REF="282"/>
or jingle repeated in every phrase is extreme∣ly
disagreeable and fastidious. <HI>Contrasts</HI> thus
multiplied become intolerably uniform; and
those oppositions, that were designed to pro∣duce
variety, degenerate, by perpetual repe∣tition,
into the most tedious symmetry. The
mind finds so little variety in this sort of com∣position,
that having heard but one half of
a phrase, it will always anticipate the other.
There is, indeed, a certain opposition in the
words of each phrase; but this opposition is
always the same; and the flowing of each pe∣riod,
though harmonious, is yet most fa∣tiguing
on account of the constant return of
the same kind of <HI>contrasts.</HI></P>
<P>SEVERAL painters have fallen into this vi∣cious
custom of multiplying <HI>contrasts</HI> beyond
measure in all their compositions, so that the
view of one single figure will enable the acute
observer to guess at the disposition of all those
that are contiguous to it. This perpetual
study of diversity produces uniformity, as has
been observed above. Besides, this passion
for multiplying <HI>contrasts</HI> has no example in
nature, which operates, on the contrary,
with a seeming disorder, void of all affecta∣tion,
<PB N="284" REF="283"/>
and, so far from giving to all bodies a
determinate and uniform motion, gives to a
great number no motion at all. The hand
of nature diversifies truly her multifarious pro∣ductions;
some bodies she holds in repose,
while she impresses upon others an infinite
variety of tendencies and movements.</P>
<P>IF the merely intellectual faculties of our
nature determine us to take pleasure in vari∣ety,
our feeling powers are not less agreeably
affected by it. The mind cannot long bear
the same objects, the same pleasures, the
same situations, if I may use that term, be∣cause
it is united to a body to which they are
insupportable. The activity of the mind, and
it's sensations and feelings depend upon the
course of the animal spirits that circulate in
the nerves; there are, of consequence, two
circumstances that suspend their vigour, <HI>viz.</HI>
the lassitude of the nerves, and the dissipation
of the animal spirits, or their entire ces∣sation.</P>
<P>THUS every thing fatigues us after a cer∣tain
time; this, at least, is undoubtedly true
with respect to those pleasures that are ex∣tremely
intense; we quit them always with
<PB N="285" REF="284"/>
the same satisfaction with which we embra∣ced
them; the fibres which were their instru∣ments
have need of repose; we must there∣fore
employ others that are in a condition to
serve us, and thus distribute equally to the
various parts of our frame the functions they
are to perform in rendering us active and
happy.</P>
<P>THE soul finds it's vigour exhausted by
any long and intense feeling. But to be des∣titute
of sentiment or feeling, is to fall into
a void which sinks and overwhelms our bet∣ter
part. We remedy this disorder, or ra∣ther
prevent this disagreeable alternative by
diversifying the modifications and pleasures
of the mind, and then it feels without
weariness.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the pleasure which is the
effect of surprise.</HEAD>
<P>THE same disposition that renders variety
agreeable to the mind, is also the occasion of
those pleasures which it receives from <HI>surprise.</HI>
This feeling of surprise pleases both from the
nature of it's object, and the quickness and
<PB N="286" REF="285"/>
rapidity with which it acts upon the mind,
which perceives either an object it did not ex∣pect,
or an object presented in a different
manner from that which it imagined before∣hand.</P>
<P>SURPRISE is excited by such objects as are
either marvellous, new, or unexpected; and
in those cases where we are struck with the
marvellous, the principal feeling is accompa∣nied
with an accessory sensation which arises
from this, that the object which we con∣template
as marvellous is also new and unex∣pected.</P>
<P>HENCE games of hazard attract the whole
attention of the mind, and affect in a lively
and agreeable manner by presenting to it a
continual train of unexpected events; and
hence also arises the pleasure we take in those
games in which we are associated with part∣ners,
for they are also a combination of un∣foreseen
events produced by the joint influ∣ence
of dexterity and hazard.</P>
<P>WE may farther reduce to the same prin∣ciple
the chief pleasure we receive from dra∣matick
<PB N="287" REF="286"/>
compositions, in which we find an
important series of events developed by de∣grees,
the most striking occurrences studious∣ly
concealed until the very moment of their
arrival, all the powers of invention employed
to create new objects of <HI>surprise,</HI> and in
which we are sometimes affected with a par∣ticular
kind of <HI>surprise</HI> upon seeing things fall
out, just as we might have conjectured be∣fore
hand.</P>
<P>WE observe, finally, that the productions
of wit and learning are read with eagerness
only because they procure us the lively plea∣sure
of novelty and <HI>surprise;</HI> and thus supply
the defect of conversation which is, almost
always, uniform and insipid, and seldom ex∣cites
the agreeable feeling now under consi∣deration.</P>
<P>SURPRISE may be excited either by the ob∣ject
itself that is presented to our view, or
by the manner in which we perceive it, and
the circumstances under which we consider
it; for an object may appear, in our per∣ception,
greater or less than it is in reality;
it may appear different from what it actually
<PB N="288" REF="287"/>
is; and even in those cases where we see it as
it is, we may see it under circumstances,
which excite an accessory feeling of <HI>surprise.</HI>
Thus in the view of any work the mind may
be struck with the circumstantial or accessory
idea of the difficulty of it's production, of the
person that contrived and finished it, of the
time or manner in which it was executed,
or of any other circumstances that are inti∣mately
connected with it.</P>
<P><HI>SUETONIUS</HI> recites the crimes of
<HI>Nero</HI> with a certain coolness and tranquillity
which astonish, and which almost persuade
the reader that the enormities he describes
excited but faintly, if at all, his indignation
and horror. But the historian stops short,
changes his style suddenly, and says, “The
earth, having suffered such a monster to
breathe upon it's surface for fourteen years,
abandoned him at last;” <HI>Tale monstrum per
quatuordecim annos perpessus terrarum orbis
tandem destituit.</HI> In this short, but emphatick
phrase, the mind is struck with different sen∣sations
of <HI>surprise</HI> arising from a variety of
circumstances. We are surprised at the his∣torian's
sudden change of style, at the disco∣very
<PB N="289" REF="288"/>
of his being affected quite otherwise than
we, at first, imagined, and at his describ∣ing,
in so few words, one of the signal re∣volutions
that happened in the <HI>Roman</HI> empire.
Thus the mind is affected, at one and the
same time, by a variety of circumstances
which concur to excite in it an agreeable emo∣tion,
and to strike it with a pleasing sur∣prise.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the various causes which may
contribute to excite a single feeling
or sensation in the mind.</HEAD>
<P>IT is necessary to observe that, generally
speaking, every sensation is excited by more
than one cause. The force of a sensation,
and that variety of feelings into which it may
be decompounded, are the result of various
and distinct causes, which, however, operate
at one and the same time. The excellence
of wit and genius consists in their exercising,
at once, several faculties of the mind, and
exciting in it a variety of feelings; and, if
we examine attentively the merit of the most
celebrated authors, we shall find that it lies
<PB N="290" REF="289"/>
principally in this; and that they please in
proportion to the number of feelings which
they produce at the same instant in the
mind.</P>
<P>WE are more pleased with a regular gar∣den
than with a confused and crowded heap
of trees; but observe the multiplicity of rea∣sons
on which this preference is founded:
1. Our view is less confined by the one than
by the other. 2. In a regular garden each
walk or alley forms a distinct and grand object,
while, in a confused heap of trees, each tree
forms, indeed, a distinct object, but only a
minute and inconsiderable one. 3. We see
an arrangement and disposition of things to
which we are not accustomed. 4. We ap∣prove
and appreciate the pains and industry
that have been employed. 5. We admire
the care that has been taken to combat and
correct perpetually the irregular fecundity of
nature, which, by new and undesired pro∣ductions,
seems disposed to involve in confu∣sion
the works of art; and this observation is
verified by the disgust with which we behold
a garden, which has been neglected, and suf∣fered
to run wild. But farther, we receive
<PB N="291" REF="290"/>
pleasure in the productions of art, not only
from various, but also from contrary causes:
Sometimes we are pleased with the difficulty
of a work; at others it is the facility of it's
execution that renders it agreeable. We of∣ten
admire in the magnificence of a country∣seat
the splendor and profusion of it's owner;
and, as often, are pleased with the art which
has formed a striking and agreeable arrange∣men
with little labour and expence.</P>
<P>PLAY affects us agreeably, because it sa∣tisfies
our avarice, and often fulfils the hopes
we entertain of making an addition to our
possessions; it flatters our vanity too, by a
secret consciousness of our being the favorites
of fortune, and by exciting the attention of
those about us to our success; it gratifies, also,
our curiosity by presenting to our view a di∣versified
spectacle of persons, characters, and
passions; in a word, it yields the various
pleasures of <HI>surprise.</HI></P>
<P>DANCING pleases by it's nimbleness and
rapidity, by the gracefulness of it's motions,
by the beauty and variety of the attitudes it
forms, by it's connexion with musick which
<PB N="292" REF="291"/>
is so intimate that we compare the dancer to
an instrument which plays in concert. But
that which renders dancing peculiarly pleasing
is a secret operation of the mind, which redu∣ces
all it's movements to <HI>certain</HI> movements,
and all it's attitudes to <HI>certain</HI> attitudes</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning sensibility.</HEAD>
<P>MOST objects please in certain respects,
and displease in others. The singing <HI>Virtuosi</HI>
of <HI>Italy,</HI> for example, are little adapted to
please; 1. Because there is nothing surpri∣sing
in the sweetness of their voices, after the
preparations to which they have submitted;
they resemble a piece of wood which the ar∣tist
has curtailed in order to make it produce
articulate founds. 2. Because they can ne∣ver
enter truly into the tender passion which
their musick is intended to express. 3. Be∣cause
they neither belong to the sex which
we love, nor to that which we esteem. On
the other hand, these same persons are not
destitute of qualities that render them agree∣able
in certain respects, as they retain, much
longer than others, the bloom and air of
youth, and possess a flexibility and sweeness
<PB N="293" REF="292"/>
of voice which are peculiar to themselves and
to their condition. Thus every object excites
a feeling, composed of many others, which
weaken each other reciprocally, and are
sometimes in direct and violent opposition.</P>
<P>THE mind sometimes augments it's enjoy∣ment,
by the power of imagination, which
multiplies the causes of pleasure by the con∣nexions
it forms, and the accessory ideas and
perceptions it creates. Thus an object that
has formerly pleased us, pleases us still, and
that for no other reason but that it has for∣merly
pleased us, and that we connect the
past idea with the present. Thus again, an
actress who has delighted us upon the stage,
continues also to delight us in a chamber;
her voice, her pronunciation, the remem∣brance
of the applauses that crowned her
performance, nay a combination that we im∣perceptibly
form between the idea of her and
that of the princess she represented upon
the scene, all this variety, all this mixture
concur in exciting one full and lively sensa∣tion
of pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="293"/>
WE are full of accessory perceptions and
ideas. A woman of a shining reputation with
a small defect, will be able to reconcile us to
that defect, and will even have credit
enough to make it pass for an ornament. The
greatest part of the women we love have lit∣tle
to recommend them, but the favorable
prejudices we entertain of them on account
of their birth and fortune, and the honours
and esteem that are lavished upon them by
certain orders of men.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning delicacy of perception and
feeling.</HEAD>
<P>PERSONS of a delicate mental frame
are those, who to every idea, and every sen∣sation,
add a variety of accessory ideas and sen∣sations.
Gross minds receive no more up∣on
the view of an object than the simple sen∣sation
which that object of itself is adapted to
excite; they neither know how to compound
nor to decompound their perceptions and
ideas; they neither augment nor diminish the
<PB N="295" REF="294"/>
gifts of nature. The case is quite otherwise
with persons of a delicate turn of mind; they
refine upon vulgar sentiments, and improve
and multiply their agreeable sensations, espe∣cially
in love, the greatest part of whose plea∣sures
is due to a quick and lively fancy. <HI>Po∣lyxenes</HI>
and <HI>Apicius</HI> enjoyed at table a variety
of sensations of their own creating, which are
unknown to vulgar gluttons; and those, who
judge with <HI>taste,</HI> concerning the productions
of wit and genius, have a multitude of per∣ceptions,
both natural and acquired, which
are entirely peculiar to themselves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the Je ne sçai quoi.</HEAD>
<P>WE find sometimes in certain persons
and in certain objects an invisible charm, a
natural gracefulness, which has not been
hitherto defined, and which we have been
obliged to express by the vague epithet <HI>Je ne
sçai quoi.</HI> It appears to me highly probable
that this secret charm is principally the effect
of surprise. We are sensibly touched, when
we find certain persons more agreeable than
at first sight we imagined them to be; and
we are filled with a pleasing kind of surprise,
<PB N="296" REF="295"/>
when we see them triumph over those de∣fects,
which the eye still perceives, but which
the heart no longer feels. Hence we find
often, among the female sex, those inexpressi∣ble
graces adorn the ugly, which are very sel∣dom
lavished upon the fair and beautiful. A
beautiful nymph generally disappoints our ex∣pectations,
and appears, after some little time,
less amiable than at first sight; after having
surprised us at first by her charms, she falls
greatly off, and surprises us at length by her
defects; but the first surprise is a past plea∣sure,
which is become faint and languid, and
is almost effaced, whereas the second is a
fresh and lively sensation of disgust. Hence
it rarely happens that the beautiful are the
objects of a violent and durable passion, which
seems rather reserved for the <HI>agreeable,</HI> than
for the <HI>fair,</HI> for those graces which strike us
unexpectedly, and which indeed we had no
reason to expect. Sumptuous and magnifi∣cent
robes are generally destitute of that grace∣ful
air, which we often find in the simplicity
of the shepherd's habit. We admire the air
of majesty that reigns in the draperies of <HI>Paul
Veronese;</HI> but we are also most agreeably
touched with the simplicity of <HI>Raphael,</HI> and
<PB N="297" REF="296"/>
the graces that flow from the pencil of <HI>Cor∣rege.
Paul Veronese</HI> promises much, and per∣forms
what he promises. <HI>Raphael</HI> and <HI>Cor∣rege</HI>
promise little, but perform a great deal,
and this is doubly pleasing to the surprised
spectator.</P>
<P>THOSE graces that can render even defor∣mity
agreeable, are more frequently centered
in the mind, than expressed in the counte∣nance.
A beautiful face discloses at once all
it's charms, and conceals nothing; but an
amiable mind shews itself only by little and
little, and at such times and in such a degree,
as it thinks proper; it can conceal itself dex∣terously
for a time, in order to shine forth af∣terwards
with a brighter lustre, and to admi∣nister
that kind of surprise, to which the
graces often owe their existence.</P>
<P>THE graces are more rarely found in the
features of the face, than in the air and man∣ners;
for these change every moment, and
may therefore every moment produce new
objects of surprise. In a word, beauty is li∣mited
to a certain set of features; but grace∣fulness
may result from an infinite variety of
<PB N="298" REF="297"/>
circumstances; so that, if I may so express
myself, there is scarcely more than one way
of being <HI>beautiful,</HI> whereas there are an hun∣dred
thousand of being <HI>agreeable.</HI></P>
<P>A GENERAL rule of conduct established
between the two sexes in all nations, whe∣ther
savage or civilized, requires, that the first
proposal of conjugal union should be made by
the men, and that the fair should have no∣thing
more to do than to grant or to reject
the tender demands of love; and this very
circumstance is a source of graces peculiar to
the sex. As they are always obliged to be
upon the defensive, they are conseqently obliged
to conceal their passions, and many of their
charms. Under this necessary restraint the
least word, look, or gesture, that breaks loose
from it's confinement, without violating the
natural and primitive law of shame-faced mo∣desty,
becomes a grace, and produces a deli∣cious
kind of surprise. Such is the wise and
excellent constitution of nature, that those
things, which, without the sacred law of mo∣desty,
would have been indifferent and insi∣pid,
are rendered most agreeable and interest∣ing
in consequence of that law, which is a
<PB N="299" REF="298"/>
source of delicate sensations, and refined plea∣sure
to all rational beings.</P>
<P>As affectation and restraint are incapable
of exciting surprise, it follows that graceful∣ness
is neither to be found in those manners
that are under the fetters of restraint, nor in
those that are the result of a laborious affecta∣tion;
but in a certain ease, and liberty that
lies between these two extremes, the avoid∣ing
of which is a circumstance that surprises
the mind in an agreeable manner.</P>
<P>ONE would imagine, that those manners
which are the most natural should be the
most easy in practice; but the case is quite
otherwise; for, by the restraints of education
we always lose more or less of the ingenuous
simplicity of nature, whose recovery yields a
high degree of pleasure.</P>
<P>NOTHING strikes us so agreeably in dress,
as that negligence and even disorder which
conceal the pains that have been taken, and
keep out of sight all the art that cleanliness
did not require, and that vanity alone could
employ. In the same manner wit is only
<PB N="300" REF="299"/>
agreeable, when it's sallies are flowing and
easy, and seem rather luckily hit off, than la∣boriously
invented and far-fetched.</P>
<P>THE man who amuses a company with
smart sayings, which are the fruits of preme∣ditation
and study, will pass indeed for a man
of wit, but not of that easy wit, which is the
spontaneous effusion of nature, and in which
alone the graces display their genuine charms.
Grace in manners or in discourse appears
most in those who are the least conscious of
possessing it, and whose plainness and simpli∣city,
promising nothing of that nature, occa∣sion
an agreeable surprise in such as at length
perceive, in the midst of this simplicity, a qua∣lity
which they so little expected.</P>
<P>FROM all this we may conclude that the
graces now under consideration are not to be
acquired; in order to possess them we must
be natural and ingenuous; and nothing is
more self-contradictory than the attempt of
studying to be natural.</P>
<P>ONE of the most beautiful fictions in the
<HI>Iliad</HI> is that of the Girdle, which imparted to
<PB N="301" REF="300"/>
<HI>Venus</HI> the power of pleasing. No image
could contribute so happily to give us a notion
of the secret magick and influence of those
graces which seem to be shed upon certain
persons by an invisible hand, and which are
intirely distinct from beauty. The mysterious
girdle could be given to no other than <HI>Venus.</HI>
It was not suitable to the majestick beauty of
<HI>Juno;</HI> for majesty requires a certain gravity,
or, in other words, a certain degree of res∣traint
which is inconsistent with the easy and
careless simplicity of the graces; nor was it
better adapted to the bold and haughty air of
<HI>Pallas,</HI> as haughtiness is irreconcileable with
the mild sweetness of the graces, and is often
liable to the suspicion of affectation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning surprise in it's progressive
state.</HEAD>
<P>THE most sublime and striking beauties
are to be found in those objects, the first view
of which excites but an inconsiderable emo∣tion
of surprise, an emotion, however, which
continues, augments, and breaks forth, at
last, into admiration and rapture. The
<PB N="302" REF="301"/>
works of <HI>Raphael</HI> do not affect us in any ex∣traordinary
manner at first sight; his imitation
of nature is so exact, that we contemplate it
at first with as little suprise, as if we saw the
real objects he represents, that is to say, al∣most
without any. But the more we examine
the sublime productions of that great artist,
the more our surprise increases, until it arises
into astonishment. In the work of an infe∣rior
pencil we are immediately struck with a
singular expression, a high colouring, a fan∣tastick
attitude, because we are not accustom∣ed
to observe them elsewhere. We may
compare <HI>Raphael</HI> with <HI>Virgil;</HI> and the <HI>Vene∣tian</HI>
painters, with their forced attitudes, may
be considered as the imitators of <HI>Lucan.
Virgil,</HI> more natural and simple, strikes less,
at first view, than after an attentive examina∣tion.
<HI>Lucan,</HI> on the contrary, strikes at first
view, and afterwards affects us little.</P>
<P>THE exact proportion, that is observed in
the construction of the famous church of <HI>St.
Peter</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> makes it appear, at first sight,
less vast and ample than it is in reality; for
we know not where to begin, nor on what
point we should first fix our eye in order to
<PB N="303" REF="302"/>
judge of it's dimensions. Were it's breadth
less considerable, we should be immediately
struck with it's length; and were it's length
diminished, it's breadth would amaze us at
first fight. But if it's vast dimensions do not
strike us with amazement at the moment that
we cast our eye upon the mighty fabrick, the
case is quite otherwise when we set about ex∣amining
it with application and attention of
mind; then the eye perceives, as it were, the
noble structure expanding itself on all sides;
and surprise, gathering force from moment
to moment, throws the soul, at length, into
the deepest astonishment. Thus the travel∣ler,
upon the first view of the <HI>Pyrenean</HI>
mountains, imagines that his eye takes in
their whole extent; but as he advances he
perceives his error, sees new summits arise,
and loses himself in the wide and endless
prospect.</P>
<P>IT often happens that the mind enjoys
pleasure in consequence of a feeling of which
it has no distinct notion, and which arises
from it's perceiving an object, as quite diffe∣rent
from what it knows that object to be in
reality. The following example will abun∣dantly
<PB N="304" REF="303"/>
illustrate this observation. The cupo∣la
of <HI>St. Peter's</HI> is of itself an immense edi∣fice;
and it is well known that <HI>Michael An∣gelo,</HI>
after an attentive view of the <HI>Pantheon,</HI>
which was the largest of the <HI>Roman</HI> temples,
said that he would erect a structure of the
same kind, with this difference only, that it
should be built in the air. He executed, ac∣cordingly,
the cupola of <HI>St. Peter's</HI> after the
model of the <HI>Pantheon;</HI> but ordered, at the
same time, the pillars which supported it to
be made so massy, that the cupola, though,
in reality, of a mountainous size, appears
quite otherwise to the eye of the spectator.
At the view therefore of this noble piece of
architecture the mind remains suspended be∣tween
what it perceives, and what it knows,
between the appearance and the reality, and
cannot recover from the surprise it feels at the
fight of an edifice, which is, at the same
time so massy and so light.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="305" REF="304"/>
<HEAD>Concerning those beauties that result
from a certain embarassment and
perplexity of mind.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind is frequently struck with sur∣prise
from its not being able to reconcile the
past with the present, what it sees with what
it has seen. There is in <HI>Italy</HI> a vast lake
called <HI>Il lago maggiore,</HI> whose borders are
entirely wild and barren: but, upon sailing
about fifteen miles in this little ocean, we find
two islands called the <HI>Borromees,</HI> about a
quarter of a mile in circumference; and in
these distinguished spots nature seems to have
lavished all those rural beauties that the most
exuberant fancy can paint. The mind is as∣tonished
at this singular contrast, and recalls
upon this occasion the pleasure it has received
from the prodigies of romance, where the
reader is transported from craggy rocks and
barren desarts into smiling landscapes and en∣chanted
ground.</P>
<P>ALL contrasts strike of necessity, because
objects placed in opposition set off each other
<PB N="306" REF="305"/>
reciprocally: thus a dwarf in company with
a person of a tall stature forms a contrast that
makes the latter appear more enormous, and
the former more minute.</P>
<P>ALL these contrasts surprise; and hence
the pleasure we receive from antitheses, and
other such figures, and in general from all
those beauties of nature and art that are pro∣duced
or heightened by opposition. When
<HI>Florus</HI> says, “Sora <HI>and</HI> Algidum, <HI>who would
think it! were formidable enemies to</HI> Rome;
Satricum <HI>and</HI> Corniculum <HI>were provinces:
we blush at the mention of</HI> Bovillae <HI>and</HI>
Verulae, <HI>yet we triumphed over them; and</HI>
Tibur, <HI>now our suburbs, and</HI> Praeneste, <HI>where
we fix our rural seats of recreation and
pleasure, were formerly the objects of our
ambitious desires, when we offered up to the
Gods our vows and petitions in the Capitol;</HI>”
when <HI>Florus,</HI> I say, expresses himself thus, he
shews us at the same time the grandeur to
which <HI>Rome</HI> arose, and the small beginnings,
from which it set out; and these are two ob∣jects,
whose striking contrast excites our asto∣nishment.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="306"/>
WE may here observe the remarkable dif∣ference
there is between an antithesis of
ideas, and an antithesis merely of words.
The latter is glaring, the former lies in some
measure concealed; the one is always in the
same form and dress, the other changes as
we please; the one is diversified and com∣plex,
the other is uniform and simple.</P>
<P>The same historian, speaking of the <HI>Sam∣nites,</HI>
observes, that the ruin of their cities
was so terrible, that in his time it was ex∣tremely
difficult to conceive how this nation
could have furnished to the <HI>Romans</HI> the oc∣casions
of four and twenty triumphs, <HI>ut non
facile apparent materia quatuor et viginti tri∣umphorum.</HI>
It is remarkable here that the
very same words, which intimate the de∣struction
of that conquered people, convey
to us an idea of their unparalleled obstinacy
and fortitude.</P>
<P>THE violence of a fit of laughter increases
in proportion to the pains we take to stifle it;
because there is then a striking contrast be∣tween
the air and gestures we assume, and
<PB N="308" REF="307"/>
those that naturally correspond with the pre∣sent
frame and disposition of our minds. In
the same manner we laugh at the sight of an
enormous nose, or any other remarkable de∣fect
in a countenance, on account of the un∣seemly
contrast which such a feature makes,
when compared with the rest. Hence we
see that contrasts are sometimes the causes of
deformity, as well as of beauty. When they
are introduced without reason, or when they
only serve to expose a defect and to place it
in a striking and conspicuous point of view,
then they render an object deformed. <HI>De∣formity</HI>
produces different effects upon the
mind, according to the ideas that are associa∣ted
with it. Considered in itself, and view∣ed
of a sudden, it excites <HI>laughter;</HI> consi∣dered
as a misfortune, it excites <HI>compassion;</HI> consi∣dered
as a mark of some noxious quality, or
only in comparison with objects which we
are accustomed to contemplate with pleasure
and with desire, it excites <HI>aversion.</HI></P>

obscure in the expression, that, to avoid all

“DE même dans nos pensées, lorsquelles
contiennent une opposition, qui est contre
le bon sens, lorsque cette opposition est
commune et aisée à trouver, elles ne plaisent
point et sont un défaut, parce qu'elles ne
causent point de surprise; et si au con∣traire
elles sont trop recherchées, elles ne
plaisent pas non plus. Il faut que dans
un ouvrage on les sente, parce qu'elles y
sont, et non parce qu'on a voulu les mon∣trer;
car pour lors la surprise ne tombent
que sur la sottise de l'auteur.”</P>
<P>ONE of the qualities that pleases us most
in an author is a certain elegant simplicity of
style<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>French</HI> word <HI>naiveté,</HI> which signifies simplicity without meanness, is difficult to be expressed without a peri∣phrasis. We therefore wish that Mr. <HI>Johnston</HI> would admit <HI>naivity</HI> into his Dictionary.</NOTE>. The attainment of this is extremely
difficult, because it lies between the sublime
and it's opposite, but so near the latter, that it
is not easy to steer along it's border without
touching it, or, to speak without a figure, it
is difficult to maintain this simplicity of style
without falling sometimes into a low and
vulgar strain.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="309"/>
THE greatest masters in musick acknow∣ledge
that those vocal-pieces which are per∣formed
with the greatest facility are always
the most difficult in the composition; a cer∣tain
proof this, that there are limits prescribed
both to our pleasures and to the art by which
they are produced.</P>
<P>When we read the pompous and lofty
strains of <HI>Corneille,</HI> and the natural and flow∣ing
versification of <HI>Racine,</HI> we can scarcely
persuade ourselves that the former composed
with ease, and the latter with difficulty and
labour; yet such was really the case.</P>
<P>A LOW and insipid style is the sublime of
the multitude, who are pleased with such
productions as appear expressly made for them,
and which are, at the same time, adapted to
their capacities.</P>
<P>THE ideas that arise in the minds of such
as are blessed with elevation of genius im∣proved
and directed by a liberal education, are
either natural<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Idies naives.</HI></NOTE>, noble, or sublime.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="310"/>
WHEN an object is presented to us under
various circumstances or in accessory points
of light that aggrandize it considerably, the
complex idea, then excited in the mind, may
be called noble. This is more especially ob∣servable
in comparisons, in which the mind
must always have it's perceptions augmented
and multiplied; for comparisons must, in
their nature, necessarily add something to
their objects, either by heightening our no∣tions
of their grandeur, or of their elegance;
and similitudes taken from mean objects are
carefully to be avoided; for the mind, instead
of contemplating them with pleasure, beholds
them with disgust, and would have studious∣ly
concealed them, had it first discovered
them.</P>
<P>WHEN the elegance or delicacy of any sub∣ject
is to be displayed, by similitudes or com∣parisons,
the mind is more pleased with the
comparisons that are formed between the qua∣lities,
actions, and manners of the objects
than with those that are drawn between the
objects themselves; as when a hero is com∣pared
<PB N="312" REF="311"/>
with a lion, a lady with a star, a swift
runner with a stag.</P>
<P><HI>MICHAEL ANGELO</HI> excelled in
giving an air of dignity to all the subjects that
exercised his sublime pencil. In his celebra∣ted
<HI>Bacchus</HI> he has not followed the ignoble
<HI>manner</HI> of the <HI>Flemish</HI> painters, who repre∣sent
that deity in a staggering attitude; for
this would have been unsuitable to the majes∣ty
of a god. He has drawn him, on the
contrary, firm upon his limbs, and in a sted∣dy
posture; but, at the same time, has diffu∣sed
through the whole countenance of the
jolly deity such a dissolute gaiety and such an
exquisite air of pleasure and satisfaction at the
sight of the sparkling liquor which he pours
into his cup, as produces the most agreeable
effect.</P>
<P>THE same admirable artist, in a piece
which represents the passion of <HI>Christ,</HI> and is
now in the gallery of <HI>Florence,</HI> has drawn
the <HI>Virgin</HI> standing in an erect posture, and
beholding the crucifixion of her son without
shedding a tear, or discovering the least mark
of affliction or pity. The sublime painter
<PB N="313" REF="312"/>
supposes her instructed in the grand mystery
of redemption, and therefore makes her sup∣port
this dreadful spectacle with resignation
and greatness of soul.</P>
<P>THERE is no production of <HI>Michael Ange∣lo,</HI>
which does, not bear some marks of the
grandeur and elevation of his genius. There
is in his very sketches that air of majesty,
which we find in those lines which <HI>Virgil</HI>
has left unfinished.</P>
<P>THERE is a gallery at <HI>Mantoua,</HI> in which
<HI>Giulio Romano</HI> has represented the giants thun∣der-struck
by <HI>Jupiter.</HI> In this celebrated
piece all the gods appear seized with astonish∣ment
and terror, while <HI>Juno,</HI> with an air of
tranquillity and fortitude, fits near <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
and points out to him a giant who has escaped
his bolts, and whom she entreats to destroy
with the rest. By this the artist has given to
<HI>Juno</HI> an air of majesty, which raises her vastly
above the other deities. We observe also in the
same piece, that the terror painted in the looks
of the gods is greater or less, in proportion,
as their places are more or less distant from
<PB N="314" REF="313"/>
the throne of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> This is highly natu∣ral;
since, in a battle, the proximity of the
victor is every way proper to dispell the fears
of his troops.</P>
