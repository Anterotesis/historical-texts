<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The EARL of BATH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER having written a Play entirely without your Knowledge; and after having frankly confessed, that I only concealed my Design, because I doubted of its meeting with your Approbation: Excuse me, if I at∣tempt to vindicate one Act of Presumption by another; and now the Piece is come abroad into the World, give me leave to hope that You will take it under your Protection.</P>
<P>When I address myself to You on so publick an Occasion, they, who know how much I owe to You, will undoubtedly expect that I shall not let slip so fair an Opportunity of ex∣pressing my Gratitude. They will naturally imagine, that the Countenance You have ever shewn me, the Kindness and Indulgence with which you have treated me, and your continued Acts of Benevolence and Generosity to me, will not be forgot; but that I shall dwell with Pleasure on a Subject, whereon I have nothing to say but what comes immediately from my Heart.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
The World, however, is deceived. Your eminent Qualities are too well known, for me to expatiate on them: And as to your particular Goodness to me, That, I fear, becomes too inconsiderable for general Notice from the Ob∣ject on which it has been exerted. I should chuse, therefore, rather to fail into another Vein: To shew that Scholars and Writers have a Title to your Patronage; and to prove, that You, of all Persons in the great World, are the very Man, with whom it is most likely that an Adventurer in Letters should make free.</P>
<P>Let us only review your Life and Conver∣sation, the Company You have always kept, and the Methods by which You have signalized Yourself in this Kingdom! Were not your earliest Connections formed with an Attention to Literature? Were not your intimate Ac∣quaintance the most eminent Men of their Time, remarkable not only for worldly Ta∣lents, and what are called solid Understandings, but distinguished by that Brilliancy and Vivacity, peculiar to the Lovers of the <HI>Belles Lettres?</HI> Did not You even condescend to associate with the professed Wits of the Age? It is well known, that You have passed many a social Evening with <HI>Steele</HI> and <HI>Addison;</HI> You have joined in the rich Humour of <HI>Arbuthnot;</HI> You have read the Comedies of <HI>Congreve,</HI> (my Brother-Student of the Law) in Manuscript; You have corresponded with <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Swift;</HI> and <HI>Gay</HI> lived and wrote in your House.</P>
<P>How You spent your Time in this dangerous Company, it is too easy to conceive. The
<PB REF="4"/>
Turn and Spirit of your Compositions, not∣withstanding your Endeavours to be concealed, soon betrayed You for their Author. Deep in the Mysteries of Politicks, and acquainted with the Revolution of every Wheel of Govern∣ment, You rendered your other Talents sub∣servient to these greater Purposes. You have been frequently known to season the Severity of Debate, by a strong Leaven of Pleasantry and Humour: Nay more, if▪ I may believe what I have heard, You have not been con∣tented merely with displaying your Eloquence in Parliament, but have exercised your other Talents, for the same End, in Concert with other wicked Wits, without Doors.</P>
<P>This, my Lord, is the Character, which I am told, You have always borne in the World; and I must confess, that, in my Opinion, You are not in the least altered. Notwithstanding You are so much farther advanced in Life, You have as much Wit, and, for ought I see, as great a Love for Wit, and Tendency to be witty, as ever. If a Pamphlet appears, whose Solidity of Argument, and Strength of Stile, gives an Alarm to the Publick, it is imme∣diately attributed to the Earl of <HI>Bath.</HI> If a little <HI>Jeu d'Esprit,</HI> or a <HI>Bon Mot,</HI> goes about the Town, ten to one but it is said to be the Earl of <HI>Bath</HI>'s. I perhaps am questioned about it. I know nothing of the Matter: But from what I see of the Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> I am always apt to think, that, if the Work is masterly, Nobody is more equal to the Execu∣tion of it; or, if the Wit is excellent, Nobody
<PB REF="5"/>
is so likely to have thrown it out in such a careless Manner, as to have forgot, almost im∣mediately, what they who heard it, always must remember.</P>
<P>Filled with this Idea of your Character, how can I bring myself to make a formal Apology for the present Undertaking? I do not find that your Wit has ever done You any Harm: That mine, if I had any, should, like Yours, be made conducive to greater Ends, might, I fear, rather be wished than expected: And yet, whether "I shall leave a Calling for this idle Trade," is a Point, which, I hope, the World will not too hastily decide, but candidly leave to Time alone to determine. If I am to blame in what I have done, You have been in Part the innocent Occasion of it, and must give me Leave to quote You as a fresh Instance of the dangerous Quality of Wit, and in the Spirit of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s <HI>Dogberry,</HI> to desire You <Q>“to cor∣rect Yourself for the Example of others.”</Q></P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>I am, My LORD, Your LORDSHIP'S most obliged, And grateful humble Servant,</SALUTE>

<LG>
<L>THE Jealous Wife! A Comedy! Poor Man!</L>
<L>A charming Subject! But a wretched Plan.</L>
<L>His skittish Wit, o'erleaping the due Bound,</L>
<L>Commits flat Trespass upon Tragick Ground.</L>
<L>Quarrels, Upbraidings, Jealousies, and Spleen,</L>
<L>Grow too familiar in the Comick Scene.</L>
<L>Tinge but the Language with Heroick Chime,</L>
<L>'Tis Passion, Pathos, Character, Sublime!</L>
<L>What round big Words had swell'd the pompous Scene,</L>
<L>A King the Husband, and the Wife a Queen!</L>
<L>Then might Distraction rend her graceful Hair,</L>
<L>See sightless Forms, and scream, and gape, and stare.</L>
<L><HI>Drawcansir</HI> Death had rag'd without Controul,</L>
<L>Here the drawn Dagger, there the poison'd Bowl.</L>
<L>What Eyes had stream'd at all the whining Woe!</L>
<L>What Hands had thunder'd at each <HI>Hah!</HI> and <HI>Oh!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Peace! The gentle Prologue Custom sends,</L>
<L>Like Drum and Serjeant, to beat up for Friends.</L>
<L>At Vice and Folly, each a lawful Game,</L>
<L>Our Author flies, but with no <HI>partial</HI> Aim.</L>
<L>He read the Manners, open as they lie</L>
<L>In Nature's Volume to the general Eye.</L>
<L>Books too he read, nor blush'd to use their store.—</L>
<L>He does but what his Betters did before.</L>
<L><HI>Shakespeare</HI> has done it, and the <HI>Grecian</HI> Stage</L>
<L>Caught Truth of Character from <HI>Homer</HI>'s Page.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If in his Scenes an honest Skill is shewn,</L>
<L>And borrowing little, much appears his own;</L>
<L><PB REF="7"/>
If what a Master's happy Pencil drew</L>
<L>He brings more forward in Dramatick View;</L>
<L>To your Decision He submits his Cause,</L>
<L>Secure of Candour, anxious for Applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if, all rude, his artless Scenes deface</L>
<L>The simple Beauties which He meant to grace,</L>
<L>If, an Invader upon others Land,</L>
<L>He spoil and plunder with a Robber's Hand,</L>
<L>Do Justice on Him!—As on Fools before,</L>
<L>And give to <HI>Blockheads</HI> past one <HI>Blockhead</HI> more.</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Use that has been made in this Comedy of <HI>Fielding</HI>'s admirable Novel of <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> must be obvious to the most ordinary Reader. Some Hints have also been taken from the Account of Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Freeman,</HI> in N<SUP>o</SUP>. 212, and N<SUP>o</SUP>. 216, of the <HI>Spectator;</HI> and the short Scene of <HI>Charles</HI>'s Intoxication, at the End of the Third Act, is partly an Imitation of the Behaviour of <HI>Syrus,</HI> much in the same Circumstances, in the <HI>Adelphi</HI> of <HI>Terence.</HI> There are also some Traces of the Character of the Jealous Wife, in one of the latter Papers of the <HI>Connoisseur.</HI></P>
<P>It would be unjust, indeed, to omit mentioning my Obligations to Mr. <HI>Garrick.</HI> To his Inspection the Comedy was submitted in its first rude State; and to my Care and Attention to follow his Advice in many Particulars, relating both to the Fable and Characters, I know that I am much indebted for the Reception which this Piece has met with from the Publick.</P>

<P>Look you, Mr. <HI>Oakly,</HI> this Usage is not to be borne.

<P>Oons!

<P>Love! it is this very Love that has made us both so miserable—Her Love for Me has con∣fined Me to my House, like a State Prisoner, with∣out the Liberty of seeing my Friends, or the Use of Pen, Ink, and Paper; while my Love for Her has made such a Fool of me, that I have never had the Spirit to contradict Her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, there you've hit it; Mrs. <HI>Oakly</HI> wou'd make an excellent Wife, if you did but know how to manage her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a rare Fellow, indeed, to talk of managing a Wife—A debauch'd Batchelor—A rattle-brain'd, rioting, Fellow—who have pick'd up your Common-place Notions of Wo∣men in Bagnios, Taverns, and the Camp; whose most refined Commerce with the Sex, has been in order to delude Country Girls at your Quarters, or to besiege the Virtue of Abigails, Milliners or Mantuamaker's Prentices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better!—So much the better! Women are all alike in the main, Brother, high or low, married or single, Quality or no Quality. I have found them so, from a Duchess down to a Milkmaid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your savage Notions are ridiculous—What do You know of a Husband's Feelings?—You, who comprise all your Qualities in your <HI>Honour,</HI> as You call it!—Dead to all Sentiments of Delicacy, and incapable of any but the grossest Attachments to Women.—This is Your boasted Refinement, Your thorough Knowledge of the World! While, with regard to Women, one poor Train of Thinking, one narrow Set of Ideas, like the Uniform of the Regiment, serves the whole Corps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very fine, Brother!—There's Common-Place for You with a Vengeance. Henceforth, expect no Quarter from Me.—I tell You again and again, I know the Sex better than You do. They all love to give themselves Airs, and to have Power:—Every Woman is a Tyrant at the Bottom. But They cou'd never make a Fool of Me.—No, no! No▪ Woman shou'd ever domineer over Me, let Her be Mistress or Wife.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Single Men can be no Judges in these Cases—They must happen in all Families—But when Things are driven to Extremities—To see a Woman in Uneasiness—A Woman one loves too—One's Wife—Who can withstand it?—You neither speak nor think like a Man that has lov'd, and been married, <HI>Major!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I cou'd hear a married Man speak my Language—I'm a Batchelor, its true; but I am no bad Judge of your Case for all that. I know Yours and Mrs. <HI>Oakly</HI>'s Disposition to an Hair. She is all Impetuosity and Fire.—A very Magazine of Touchwood and Gunpowder.—You are hot enough too upon Occasion, but then it's over in an Instant. In comes Love and conjugal Affection, as You call it;—That is, mere Folly and Weakness—And You draw off your
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
Forces, just when You shou'd persue the Attack, and follow your Advantage. Have at Her with Spirit, and the Day's your own, Brother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell You, Brother, You mistake the Mat∣ter. Sulkiness, Fits, Tears!—These, and such as these, are the Things which make a feeling Man uneasy. Her Passion and Violence have not half such an Effect on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then, You may be sure, she'll play that upon You, which she finds does most Exe∣cution. But You must be Proof against every Thing. If She's furious, set Passion against Passion; if You find Her at her Tricks, play off Art against Art, and foil Her at her own Weapons. That's your Game, Brother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what wou'd You have Me do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, as You please, for one Month, whe∣ther She likes it or not; and I'll answer for it, She will consent You shall do as You please all her Life after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is fine Talking—You do not consi∣der the Difficulty that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must overcome all Difficulties. As∣sert your Right boldly, Man! Give your own Orders to Servants, and see they observe them; read your own Letters, and never let Her have a Sight of them; make your own Appointments, and never be persuaded to break them; see what Company You like; go out when You please; return when You please, and don't suffer Yourself to be call'd to account where you have been. In short, do but shew Yourself a Man of Spirit, leave off Whining about Love and Tenderness, and Nonsense, and the Business is done, Brother!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe You're in the Right, <HI>Major</HI>—I see You're in the Right. I'll do't, I'll certainly do't.—But then it hurts Me to the Soul, to
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
think what Uneasiness I shall give Her. The first Opening of My Design will throw Her into Fits, and the Persuit of it, perhaps, may be fatal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fits! Ha! ha! ha!—Fits!—I'll en∣gage to cure Her of her Fits. No-body under∣stands Hysterical Cases better than I do: Besides, my Sister's Symtoms are not very dangerous—Did You ever hear of Her falling into a Fit, when You was not by?—Was She ever found in Convulsions in her Closet?—No, no, these Fits, the more Care You take of them, the more You will increase the Distemper: Let them alone, and they will wear themselves out, I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>True—Very true—You're certainly in the Right—I'll follow Your Advice. Where do You dine To-day? I'll order the Coach, and go with You.</P>

<P>Let me see—Out of the famous <HI>Tantwivy</HI> by <HI>White Stockings: White Stockings</HI> his Dam, full Sister to the <HI>Proserpine Filly,</HI> and his Sire—Pox on't, how unlucky it is, that this damn'd Accident shou'd happen in the <HI>New-market</HI> Week!—Ten to one I lose my Match with Lord <HI>Choakjade,</HI> by not riding myself, and I shall have no Opportunity to hedge my Bets neither—What a damned Piece of Work have I made on't!—I have knocked up poor <HI>Snip,</HI> shall lose my Match, and as to <HI>Har∣riot,</HI> why, the Odds are that I lose my Match there too—A skittish young Tit! If I once get Her tight in hand, I'll make Her wince for it.—Her Estate joined to my own, I wou'd have the finest Stud, and noblest Kennel in the whole Coun∣try—But here comes her Father, puffing and blowing, like a broken-winded Horse up Hill.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why don't You enquire after Her Yourself? Why don't You run up and down the whole Town after Her?—T'other young Rascal knows where She is, I warrant You—What a Plague it is to have a Daughter! When one loves Her to Distraction, and has toil'd and labour'd to make Her happy, the ungrateful Slut will sooner go to Hell her own Way—But She shall have Him—I will make Her happy, if I break her Heart for it—A provoking Gipsy!—To run away, and torment her poor Father, that doats on Her!—I'll never see her Face again—Sir <HI>Harry,</HI> how can we get any Intelligence of Her? Why don't You speak? Why don't You tell Me?—Zouns!

<P>Zouns!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>H.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose You put an Advertisement into the News-Papers, describing her Marks, her Age, her Height, and where She stray'd from. I re∣cover'd a bay Mare once by that Method.</P>

<P>Which way shall I turn Myself?—I am half-distracted—If I go to that young Dog's House, he has certainly convey'd her somewhere out of my Reach—If She does not send to Me To day, I'll give Her up for ever—Per∣haps though, She may have met with some Acci∣dent, and has nobody to assist Her.—No, She is certainly with that young Rascal—I wish She

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>After all, that Letter was certainly intended for my Husband. I see plain enough They are all in a Plot against Me. My Husband intriguing, the Major working Him up to affront Me, <HI>Charles</HI> owning his Letters, and so playing into each other's Hands.—They think Me a Fool I find—But I'll be too much for Them yet—I have desired to speak with Mr. <HI>Oakly,</HI> and expect Him here immediately. His Temper is naturally open, and if He thinks my Anger abated, and my Suspicions laid asleep, He will certainly betray Himself by his Behaviour. I'll assume an Air of Good-humour, pretend to believe the fine Story they have trumped up, throw Him off his Guard, and so draw the Secret out of Him. Here He comes. How hard it is to dissemble one's Anger! O, I cou'd rate Him soundly! But I'll keep down my Indignation at present, though it choaks Me.</P>

<P>Your Ladyship does Me too much Honour. Here I am <HI>en bottine</HI> as You see—just come from the Manége. Miss <HI>Russet,</HI> I am your Slave. I declare it makes Me quite happy to find You together. 'Pon Honour, Ma'am <STAGE><HI>[to</HI> Harriot]</STAGE> I begin to conceive great Hopes of You; and as for You, Lady <HI>Freelove,</HI> I cannot sufficiently
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
commend your Assiduity with your fair Pupil. She was before possest of every Grace that Na∣ture cou'd bestow on Her, and No-body is so well qualified as your Ladyship, to give Her the <HI>Bon Ton.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Compliment and Contempt all in a Breath! My Lord, I am obliged to You. But waving my Acknowledgments, give Me Leave to ask your Lordship, whether Nature and the <HI>Bon Ton</HI> (as you call it) are so different, that We must must give up one in order to obtain the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. <HI>Trink.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Totally opposite, Madam. The chief Aim of the <HI>Bon Ton</HI> is to render Persons of Family different from the Vulgar, for whom indeed Nature serves very well. For this Reason it has, at various Times, been ungenteel to see, to hear, to walk, to be in good Health, and to have twenty other horrible Perfections of Nature. Nature indeed may do very well sometimes. It made You, for Instance, and it then made something very lovely, and if You wou'd suffer Us of Quality to give You the <HI>Ton,</HI> You wou'd be absolutely divine: But now—Me—Madam—Me.—Nature never made such a Thing as Me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, indeed, I think, your Lordship has very few Obligations to Her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. <HI>Trink.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then You really think it's all my own? I declare now that is a mighty genteel Compliment. Nay, if you begin to flatter already, You improve a-pace. 'Pon Honour, Lady <HI>Freelove,</HI> I believe We shall make something of Her at last.</P>
</SP>

<P>You are out of Nature now, <HI>Harriot!</HI> I am sure no Woman but Yourself, ever objected to being carried among Persons of Quality. Wou'd You believe it? My Lord! Here has She been a whole Week in Town, and wou'd never suffer Me to introduce Her to a Route, an Assembly, a Concert, or even to Court, or to the Opera; nay, wou'd hardly so much as mix with a living Soul that has visited Me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. <HI>Trink.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No Wonder, Madam, You do not adopt the Manners of Persons of Fashion, when You will not even honour Them with your Company. Were You to make one in our little <HI>Coteries,</HI> We shou'd soon make You sick of the Boors and Bumkins of the horrid Country. By the bye, I met a Monster at the Riding-House this Morning, who gave Me some Intelligence, that will surprize You, concerning your Family.</P>

<P>This Monster, Madam, was formerly my head Groom, and had the Care of all my running Horses, but growing most abominably surly and extravagant, as You know all those Fellows do, I turned him off; and ever since my Brother <HI>Slouch Trinket</HI> has had the Care of my Stud, rides all my principal Matches himself, and—</P>

<P>Dear my Lord, don't talk of your Groom and your Brother, but tell Me the News. Do You know any thing of my Father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. <HI>Trink.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your Father, Madam, is now in Town. This Fellow, You must know, is now Groom to Sir <HI>Harry Beagle,</HI> your sweet rural Swain, and in∣formed
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
Me, that his Master, and your Father▪ were running all over the Town in Quest of You▪ and that He himself had Orders to enquire after You; for which Reason, I suppose, He came to the Riding-House Stables to look after a Horse, thinking it, to be sure, a very likely Place to meet You. Your Father perhaps is gone to seek You at the <HI>Tower,</HI> or <HI>Westminster-Abby,</HI> which is all the Idea he has of <HI>London;</HI> and your faithful Lover is probably cheapening a Hunter, and drinking strong Beer, at the <HI>Horse and Jockey</HI> in <HI>Smithfield.</HI></P>

We gave Them a tundering Broadside, which They resaved like Men; and one of Them made use of small Arms, which carried off the weathermost Corner of <HI>Ned Gage</HI>'s Hat; so I immediately stood in with Him, and raked Him, but resaved a Wound on my starboard Eye, from the Stock of the Pistol.

<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll do every thing in my Power to serve You. I know of your leaving your Father, by a Letter We have had from Him. Pray let me know the rest of your Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Story, Sir, is very short. When I left my Father's, I came immediately to <HI>London,</HI> and took Refuge with a Relation, where, instead of meeting with the Protection I expected, I was alarmed with the most infamous Designs upon my Honour. It is not an Hour ago, since your Ne∣phew rescued Me from the Attempts of a Villain. I tremble to think, that I left Him actually engaged in a Duel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is very safe. He has just sent home the Chariot from the <HI>St. Alban</HI>'s Tavern, where He dines To-Day. But what are your Commands for Me, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am heartily glad to hear of his Safety.—The Favour, Sir, I would now request of You is, that You will suffer Me to remain for a few Days in your House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that in the mean Time You will use your utmost Endeavours to reconcile Me to my Father, without his forcing Me into a Marriage with Sir <HI>Harry Beagle.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the most perplexing Situation!—Why did not <HI>Charles</HI> take Care to bestow You pro∣perly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is most probable, Sir, that I shou'd not have consented to such a Measure Myself. The World is but too apt to censure, even without a Cause: And if You are so kind as to admit Me into your House, I must desire not to consider Mr. <HI>Oakly</HI> in any other Light than as your Nephew, as in my present Circumstances I have particular Ob∣jections to it.</P>

<P>I hope, Sir, You do not doubt the Truth of what I have told You.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>I religiously believe every Tittle of it, Madam, but I have particular Family Considerations, that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure Sir, You cannot suspect Me to be base enough to form any Connections in your Family, contrary to your Inclinations, while I am living in your House.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
We may be interrupted.—The Family Considera∣tion I hinted at, is nothing else than my Wife. She is a little unhappy in her Temper, Madam!—And if You was to be admitted into the House, I don't know what might be the Consequence.</P>

<P>Still that wou'd not do, Madam!—Why this very Morning, when the Letter came from your Father, though I positively denied any Know∣ledge of it, and <HI>Charles</HI> owned it, yet it was almost impossible to pacify her.</P>

<P>What shall I do? What will become of Me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look'ye, my dear Madam, since my Wife is so strong an Objection, it is absolutely impossible for Me to take You into the House. Nay if I had not known She was gone out, just before You came, I shou'd be uneasy at your being here even now. So We must manage as well as We can. I'll take a private Lodging for You a little way off, unknown to <HI>Charles,</HI> or my Wife, or any Body; and if Mrs. <HI>Oakly</HI> shou'd discover it at last, why the whole Matter will light upon <HI>Charles,</HI> You know.</P>

<P>Peace! my Love!—My dear Life, make no Noise!—I have been hovering about the House this Hour—I just now saw your Father and Sir <HI>Harry</HI> go out, and have seized this precious Opportunity to throw Myself at your Feet.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>O my dear <HI>Harriot,</HI> your Words and Looks cut Me to the Soul. You can't imagine what I suffer, and have suffer'd since last Night—And yet I have in some fond Moments flatter'd My∣self, that the Service I was so fortunate as to do You
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>
at Lady <HI>Freelove</HI>'s, wou'd plead a little in my Fa∣vour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may remember, Sir, that You took a very early Opportunity of cancelling that Obli∣gation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do remember it with Shame and Despair. But may I perish, if my Joy at having delivered You from a Villain, was not the Cause! My Trans∣port more than half intoxicated Me, and Wine made an easy Conquest over Me.—I tremble to think lest I shou'd have behav'd in such Manner, as You cannot pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whether I pardon You or no, Sir, is a Matter of mighty little Consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>O my <HI>Harriot!</HI> Upbraid Me, reproach Me, do any Thing but look and talk with that Air of Coldness and Indifference. Must I lose You for one Offence? when my Soul doats on You, when I love You to Distraction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did it appear like Love, your Conduct Yesterday? To lose Yourself in Riot, when I was exposed to the greatest Distresses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel, I feel my Shame, and own it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>You confess that You don't know in what Manner You behaved. Ought not I to tremble at the very Thoughts of a Man, devoted to a Vice, which renders him no longer a Judge or Master of his own Conduct?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Abandon Me, if ever I am guilty of it again. O <HI>Harriot!</HI> I am distracted with ten thou∣sand Fears and Apprehensions of losing You for ever—The Chambermaid, whom I brib'd to admit Me to You, told Me that when the two Gentlemen went out, they talk'd of a Licence.—What am I to think? Is it possible that You can resign Your∣self to Sir <HI>Harry Beagle?</HI> <STAGE>[Harriot <HI>pauses.]</HI></STAGE> Can You then consent to give your Hand to another?
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
No, let Me once more deliver You—Let us seize this lucky Moment!—My Chariot stands at the Corner of the next Street—Let Me gently force You, while their Absence allows it, and convey You from the brutal Violence of a constrained Marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!—I will wait the Event, be it what it may—O <HI>Charles,</HI> I am too much inclin'd—They shan't force Me to marry Sir <HI>Harry</HI>—But your Behaviour—Not half an Hour ago, my Father reproach'd Me with the Looseness of your Character. <STAGE>[Weeping.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see my Folly, and am asham'd of it. You have reclaim'd Me, <HI>Harriot!</HI>—On my Soul, You have.—If all Women were as attentive as Yourself to the Morals of their Lovers, a Liber∣tine wou'd be an uncommon Character.—But let Me persuade You to leave this Place, while You may—Major <HI>Oakly</HI> will receive us at his House with Pleasure—I am shock'd at the Thoughts of what your Stay here may reserve You to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am determin'd to remain.—To leave my Father again, to go off openly with a Man, of whose libertine Character He has Him∣self so lately been a Witness, wou'd justify his An∣ger, and impeach my Reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fool! Fool! How unhappy have I made Myself!—Consider, my <HI>Harriot,</HI> the Peculiarity of your Situation; besides, I have Reason to fear other Designs against You.</P>

<P>Hey day! What have I done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think You might find better Em∣ployment, than to create Divisions between mar∣ried People—and You, Sir!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but my Dear!—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Might have more Sense, as well as Tenderness, than to give Ear to such idle Stuff.—</P>

<P>Lord! Lord!—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You and your wise Counsellor there, I suppose, think to carry all your Points with Me.—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was ever any Thing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But it won't do Sir! You shall find that I will have my own Way, and that I will go∣vern my own Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had better learn to govern Yourself by half. Your Passion makes You ridiculous. Did ever any body see so much Fury and Violence, af∣fronting your best Friends, breaking my Peace, and disconcerting your own Temper? And all for what? for nothing. 'Sdeath! Madam, at these Years You ought to know better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>At these Years!—Very fine!—Am I to be talk'd to in this Manner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Talk'd to!—Why not?—You have talk'd to Me long enough—almost talked Me to Death—and I have taken it all in hopes of making

You quiet—But all in vain, for the more one bears, the worse You are. Patience, I find, is all thrown away upon You—and henceforward, come what may, I am resolved to be Master of my own House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So! so!—Master indeed!—Yes, Sir, and you'll take care to have Mistresses enough too, I warrant You.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I may; but they shall be quiet ones, I can assure You.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! and do You think that I am such a tame Fool as to sit quietly and bear all this?—You shall know, Sir, that I will resent this Be∣haviour—You shall find that I have a Spirit—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of the Devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Intolerable!—You shall find then that I will exert that Spirit. I am sure I have need of it.—As soon as my House is once cleared again, I'll shut my Doors against all Company—You shan't see a single Soul for this Month.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath! Madam, but I will.—I'll keep open House for a Year—I'll send Cards to the whole Town—Mr. <HI>Oakly</HI>'s Route! All the World will come—And I'll go among the World too—I'll be mewed up no longer.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, You won't let Me speak—</P>

<P>Dear Madam! You had but a partial Hearing of our Conversation. It related entirely to this Gentleman.</P>

<P>To put it beyond Doubt, Madam, Mr. <HI>Russet</HI> and my Guardian have consented to our Marriage; and We are in Hopes that You will not withhold your Approbation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have no further Doubt—I see You are innocent, and it was cruel to suspect You—

<P>Do not disturb Yourself with such Appre∣hensions. I am sure Mr. <HI>Oakly</HI> loves You most af∣fectionately.</P>

<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can hold no longer. <STAGE>[Going to Her.]</STAGE> My Affection for You, Madam, is as warm as ever, Nothing can ever extinguish it. My constrained Be∣haviour cut me to the Soul—For within these few Hours it has been all constrained—and it was with the utmost Difficulty that I was able to support it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Oak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O, Mr. <HI>Oakly,</HI> how have I exposed Myself! What low Arts has my Jealousy induced Me to practice! I see my Folly, and fear that You can never forgive Me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oak.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive You!—You are too good, my Love!—Forgive You!—Can You forgive Me?—This Change transports Me.—Brother! Mr. <HI>Russet! Charles! Harriot!</HI> give Me Joy!—I am the happiest Man in the World.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>Joy, much Joy to you both! though, by-the-bye, You are not a little obliged to Me for it. Did not I tell You I wou'd cure all the Disorders in your Family? I beg Pardon, Sister, for taking the Liberty to prescribe for You. My Medicines have been somewhat rough, I believe, but they have had an admirable Effect, and so don't be an∣gry with your Physician.</P>

<P>I am indeed obliged to You, and I feel—</P>
