<P>EMILY was somewhat surprised, on
the following day, to find that Annette
heard of Madame Montoni's confine∣ment
in the chamber over the portal, as
well as of her purposed visit there, on
the approaching night. That the cir∣cumstance,
which Barnardine had so so∣lemnly
enjoined her to conceal, he had
himself told to so indiscreet an hearer as
Annette, appeared very improbable, though
he had now charged her with a message,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
concerning the intended interview. He
requested, that Emily would meet him,
unattended, on the terrace, at a little after
midnight, when he himself would lead her
to the place he had promised; a proposal,
from which she immediately shrunk, for a
thousand vague fears darted athwart her
mind, such as had tormented her on the
preceding night, and which she neither
knew how to trust, or to dismiss. It fre∣quently
occurred to her, that Barnardine
might have deceived her, concerning Ma∣dame
Montoni, whose murderer, perhaps,
he really was; and that he had deceived
her by order of Montoni, the more easily
to draw her into some of the desperate
designs of the latter. The terrible sus∣picion,
that Madame Montoni no longer
lived, thus came, accompanied by one
not less dreadful for herself. Unless the
crime, by which the aunt had suffered, was
instigated merely by resentment, uncon∣nected
with profit, a motive, upon which
Montoni did not appear very likely to act,
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
its object must be unattained, till the niece
was also dead, to whom Montoni knew
that his wife's estates must descend. Emily
remembered the words, which had in∣formed
her, that the contested estates in
France would devolve to her, if Madame
Montoni died, without consigning them to
her husband, and the former obstinate perse∣verance
of her aunt made it too probable,
that she had, to the last, withheld them.
At this instant, recollecting Barnardine's
manner, on the preceding night, she
now believed, what she had then fancied,
that it expressed malignant triumph. She
shuddered at the recollection, which con∣firmed
her fears, and determined not to
meet him on the terrace. Soon after, she
was inclined to consider these suspicions as
the extravagant exaggerations of a timid
and harassed mind, and could not believe
Montoni liable to such preposterous de∣pravity
as that of destroying, from one
motive, his wife and her niece. She
blamed herself for suffering her romantic
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
imagination to carry her so far beyond the
bounds of probability, and determined to
endeavour to check its rapid flights, lest
they should sometimes extend into mad∣ness
Still, however, she shrunk from the
thought of meeting Barnardine, on the
terrace, at midnight; and still the wish to
be relieved from this terrible suspense,
concerning her aunt, to see her, and to
sooth her sufferings, made her hesitate
what to do,</P>
<P>“Yet how is it possible, Annette, I
can pass to the terrace at that hour?” said
she, recollecting herself, “the sentinels
will stop me, and Signor Montoni will
hear of the affair.”</P>
<P>“O ma'mselle! that is well thought of,”
replied Annette. “That is what Barnar∣dine
told me about. He gave me this
key, and bade me say it unlocks the door
at the end of the vaulted gallery, that
opens near the end of the east rampart, so
that you need not pass any of the men
in watch. He bade me say, too, that his
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
reason for requesting you to come to the
terrace was, because he could take you to
the place you wane to go to, without
opening the great doors of the hall, which
grate so heavily.”</P>
<P>Emily's spirits were somewhat calmed
by this explanation, which seemed to be
honestly given to Annette. “But why
did he desire I would come alone, An∣nette?”
said she.</P>
<P>“Why that was what I asked him my∣self,
ma'amselle. Says I, Why is my young
lady to come alone?—Surely I may come
with her!—What harm can Ido? But he
said “No—no—I tell you not,” in his gruff
way. Nay, says I, I have been trusted in
as great affairs as this,. I warrant, and it's
a hard matter if I can't keep a secret now.
Still he would say nothing but—“No—no—no.”
Well, says I, if you will only trust
me, I will tell you a great secret, that was
told me a month ago, and I have never
opened my lips about it yet—so you need,
not be afraid of telling me. But all would
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
not do. Then, ma'amselle, I went so far
as to offer him a beautiful new sequin,
that Ludovico gave me for a keep-sake,
and I would not have parted with it for
all St. Marco's Place; but even that would
not do! Now what can be the reason of
this? But I know, you know, ma'am, who
you are going to see.”</P>
<P>“Pray did Barnardine tell you this?”</P>
<P>“He! No, ma'amselle, that he did not.”</P>
<P>Emily enquired who did, but Annette
shewed, that she <HI>could</HI> keep a secret.</P>
<P>During the remainder of the day, Emily's
mind was agitated with doubts and fears
and contrary determinations, on the sub∣ject
of meeting this Barnardine on the
rampart, and submitting herself to his gui∣dance,
she scarcely knew whither. Pity
for her aunt and anxiety for herself alter∣nately
swayed her determination, and night
came, before she had decided upon her
conduct. She heard the castle clock strike
eleven—twelve—and yet her mind wavered.
The time, however, was now come, when
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
she could hesitate no longer: and then the
interest she felt for her aunt overcame
other considerations, and, bidding Annette
follow her to the outer door of the vaulted
gallery, and there a wait her return, she
descended from her chamber. The castle
was perfectly still, and the great hall, where
so lately she had witnessed a scene of
dreadful. contention, now returned only
the whispering footsteps of the two solitary
figures gliding fearfully between the pillars,
and gleamed only to the feeble lamp they
carried. Emily, deceived by the long sha∣dows
of the pillars and by the catching
lights between, often stopped, imagining
she saw some person, moving in the distant
obscurity of the perspective; and, as she
passed these pillars, she feared to turn her
eyes toward them, almost expecting to see a
figure start out from behind their broad
shaft. She reached, however, the vaulted
gallery, without interruption, but unclosed
its outer door with a trembling hand, and,
charging Annette not to quit it and to
keep it a little open, that she might be
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
heard if she called, she delivered to her
the lamp, which she did not dare to take
herself becausese of the men on watch, and,
alone, stepped out upon the dark terrace.
Every thing was so still, that she feared,
lest her own light steps should be heard
by the distant sentinels, and she walked
cautiously towards the spot, where she had
before met Barnardine, listening for a
sound, and looking onward through the
gloom in search of him. At length, she
was startled by a deep voice, that spoke
near her, and she paused, uncertain whether
it was his, till it spoke again, and she then
recognized the hollow tones of Barnardine,
who had been punctual to the moment,
and was at the appointed place, resting on
the rampart wall. After chiding her for
not coming sooner, and saying, that he
had been waiting nearly half an hour, he
desired Emily, who made no reply, to
follow him to the door, through which he
had entered the terrace.</P>
<P>While he unlocked it, she looked back
to that she had left, and, observing the
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
rays of the lamp stream through a small
opening, was certain, that Annette was
slill there. But her remote situation could
little befriend Emily, after she had quitted
the terrace; and, when Barnardine un∣closed
the gate, the dismal aspect of the
passage beyond, shewn by a torch burning
on the pavement, made her shrink from
following him alone, and she refused to go,
unless Annette might accompany her.
This, However, Barnardine absolutely re∣fused
to permit, mingling at the same
time with his refusal such artful circum∣stances
to heighten the pity and curiosity
of Emily towards her aunt; that, she, at
length, consented to follow him alone to
the portal.</P>
<P>He then took up the torch, and led her
along the passage, at the extremity of
which he unlocked another door, whence
they descended, a few steps, into a chapel,
which, as Barnardine held up the torch to
light her, Ernily observed to be in ruins,
and she immediately rccolledled a former
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
conversation of Annette, concerning it,
with very unpleasant emotions. She
looked fearfully on the almost roofless walls,
green with damps, and on the gothic
points of the windows, where the ivy and
the briony had long supplied the place of
glass, and ran mantling among the broken
capitals of some columns, that had once
supported the roof. Barnardine stumbled
over the broken pavement, and his voice,
as he uttered a sudden oath, was returned
in hollow echoes, that made it more ter∣rific.
Emily's heart sunk; but she still
followed him, and he turned out of what
had been the principal aisle of the chapel.
“Down these steps, lady,” said Barnardine,
as he descended a flight, which appeared
to lead into the vaults; but Emily paused
on the top, and demanded, in a tremulous
tone, whither he was conducting her,</P>
<P>“To the portal,” said Barnardine.</P>
<P>“Cannot we go through the chapel to
the portal?” said Emily.</P>
<P>“No, Signora, that leads to the inner
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
court, which I don't choose to unlock.
This way, and we shall reach the outer
court presently,”</P>
<P>Emily still hesitated; fearing not only
to go on, but, since she had gone thus far,
to irritate Bamardine by refusing to. go
further.</P>
<P>“Come, lady,” said the man, who had
nearly reached the bottom of the flight,
“make a little haste; I cannot wait here all night.”</P>
<P>“Whither do these steps lead?” said
Emily, yet, pausing.</P>
<P>“To the portal,” repeated Barnardine,
in an angry tone, “I will wait no longer.”
As he said this, he moved on with the
light, and Emily, fearing to provoke him
by further delay, reluctantly followed.
From the steps, they proceeded through
a passage, adjoining the vaults, the walls
of which were dropping with unwholesome
dews, and the vapours, that crept along
the ground, made the torch burn so dimly,
that Emily expected every moment to see
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
it extinguished, and Barnardine could
scarcely find his way. As they advanced,
these vapours thickened, and Barnardine,
believing the torch was expiring, slopped
for a moment to trim it. As he then rested
against a pair of iron gates, that opened
from the passage, Emily saw, by uncertain
flashes of light, the vaults beyond, and,
near her, heaps of earth, that seemed to
surround an open grave. Such an object,
in such a scene, would, at any time, have
disturbed her; but now she was shocked
by an instantaneous presentiment, that
this was the grave of her unfortunate aunt,
and that the treacherous Barnardine was
leading herself to destruction. The ob∣scure
and terrible place, to which he had
conducted her, seemed to juslify the
thought; it was a place suited for murder,
a receptacle for the dead, where a deed of
horror might be committed, and no vestige
appear to proclaim it. Emily was so
overwhelmed with terror, that for a mo∣ment,
she was unable to determine what
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
conduct to pursue. She then considered,
that it would be vain to attempt an escape
from Barnardine, by flight, since the
length and the intricacy of the way she
had passed, would soon enable him to over∣take
her, who was unacquainted with the
turnings, and whose feebleness would not
suffer her to run long with swiftness. She
feared equally to irritate him by a disclo∣sure
of her suspicions, which a refusal to
accompany him further certainly would
do; and, since she was already as much
in his power as it was possible she could
be, if she proceeded, she at length, deter∣mined
to suppress, as far as she could, the
appearance of apprehension, and to follow
silently whither he designed to lead her.
Pale with horror and anxiety, she now
waited till Barnardine had trimmed the
torch, and, as her sight glanced again
upon the grave, she could not forbear en∣quiring,
for whom it was prepared. He
took his eyes from the torch, and fixed
them upon her face without speaking. She
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
faintly repeated the question, but the
man, shaking the torch, passed on; and
she followed, trembling, to a second flight
of steps, having ascended Which, a door
delivered them into the first court of the
castle. As they crossed it, the light shew∣ed
the high black walls around them,
fringed with long grass and dank weeds,
that found a scanty soil among the
mouldering stones; the heavy buttresses,
with, here and there between them, a
narrow grate, that admitted a freer circu∣lation
of air to the court, the massy iron
gates, that led to the castle, whose clus∣tering
turrets appeared above, and, oppo∣site
the huge towers and arch of the portal
itself. In this scene the large, uncouth
person of Barnardine, bearing the torch,
formed a characteristic figure. This Bar∣nardine
was wrapt in a long dark cloak,
which scarcely allowed the kind; of half∣boots,
or sandals, that were laced upon his
legs, to appear, and shewed only the point
of a broad-sword, which he usually wore,
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
slung in a belt across his shoulders. On
his head was a heavy flat velvet cap, some∣what
resembling a turban, in which was a
short feather; the visage beneath it shewed
strong features, and a countenance fur∣rowed
with the lines of cunning and dark∣ened
by habitual discontent.</P>
<P>The view of the court, however, reani∣mated
Emily, who, as she crossed silently
towards the portal, began to hope, that
her own fears, and not the treachery of
Barnardine, had deceived her. She look∣ed
ainxiously up at the first casement, that
appeared above the losty arch of the port∣cullis;
but it was dark, and she enquired,
whether it belonged to the chamber, where
Madame Montoni was confined. Emily
spoke low, and Barnardine, perhaps, did
not hear her question, for he returned no
answer; and they, soon after, entered the
postern door of the gate-way, which
brought them to the foot of a narrow
staircase, that wound up one of the towers.</P>
<P>“Up this stair-case the Signora lies,”
said Barnardine.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
“Lies!” repeated Emily faintly, as
she began to ascend.</P>
<P>“ She lies in, the upper chamber,” said
Barnardine.</P>
<P>As they passed up, the wind, which
poured, through the narrow cavities in the
wall, made the torch flare, and it threw
a stronger gleam upon the grim and sallow
countenance of Barnardine, and discovered
more fully the desolation of the place—the
rough stone walls, the spiral stairs,
black with age, and a suit of antient ar∣mour,
with an iron visor, that, hung upon
the walls, and, appeared a trophy of some former victory.</P>
<P>Having reached a landing-place, “You
may wait here, lady,” said he, applying a
key to the door of a chamber, “while I
go up, and tell the Signora you are
coming.”</P>
<P>“That ceremony is unnecessary,” re∣plied
Emily, “my aunt will rejoice to
see me.”</P>
<P>“I am not so sure of that” said Barn∣ardine,
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
pointing to the room he had opened:
“Come in here, lady, while I step up.”</P>
<P>Emily, surprised and somewhat shocked,
did not dare to oppose him further, but,
as he was turning away with the torch,
desired he would not leave her in dark∣ness.
He looked around, and, observing
a tripod lamp, that stood on the stairs,
lighted and gave it to Emily, who stepped
forward into a large old chamber, and he
closed the door. As she listened anxiously
to his departing steps, she thought he de∣scended,
instead of ascending, the stairs; but
the gusts of wind, that whistled round the
portal, would not allow her to hear dis∣tinctly
any other sound. Still, however,
she listened,' and, perceiving no step in
the room above, where he had affirmed
Madame Montoni to be, her anxiety in∣creased
though she considered, that the
thickness of the floor in this strong build∣ing
might prevent any sound reaching her
from the upper chamber. The next mo∣ment,
in a pause of the wind, she distin∣guished
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Barnardine's step descending to
the court, and then thought she heard his
voice, but, the rising gust again over∣coming
other sounds, Emily, to be certain
on this point, moved softly to the door,
which, on attempting to open it, she dis∣covered
was fastened. All the horrid ap∣prehensions,
that had lately assailed her,
returned at this instant with redoubled
force, and no longer appeared like the ex∣aggerations
of a timid spirit, but seemed.
to have been sent to warn her of her fate.
She now did not doubt, that Madame
Montoni had been murdered, perhaps in
this very chamber; or that she herself was
brought hither for the same purpose The
countenance, the manners and the recol∣lected
words of Barnardine, when he had
spoken of her aunt, confirmed her worst
fears. For some moments, she was inca∣pable
of considering of any means, by
which she might attempt an escape. Still
she listened, but heard footsteps neither on
the stairs, or in the room above; she
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
thought, however, that she again dlstin∣guished
Barnardine's voice below, and
went to a grated window, that opened
upon the court, to enquire further. Here,
she plainly heard his hoarse accents, min∣gling
with the blast, that swept by, but
they were lost again so quickly, that their
meaning could not be interpreted; and
then the light of a torch, which seemed to
issue from the portal below, flashed across
the court, and the long shadow of a man,
who was under the arch-way, appeared
upon the pavement. Emily, from the huge∣ness
of this sudden portrait, concluded it
to be that of Barnardine; but other deep
tones, which passed in the wind, soon con∣vinced
her he was not alone, and that his
companion was not a person very liable to
pity.</P>
<P>When her spirits had overcome the first
shock of her situation, she held up the
lamp to examine, if the chamber afforded
a possibility of an escape. It was a spa∣cious
room, whose walls, wainscoted with
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
rough oak, shewed no casement but the
grated one, which Emily had left, and no
other door than that, by which she had
entered. The feeble rays of the lamp,
however, did not allow her to see at once
its full extent; she perceived no furniture,
except, indeed, an iron chair, fastened in
the centre of the chamber, immediately
over which depending on a chain from
the cieling, hung an iron ring. Having
gazed upon, these, for some time, with
wonder and horror, she next observed
iron bars below, made for the purpose of
confining the feet, and on the arms of the
chair were rings of the same metal. As
she continued to. survey them, me con∣cluded,
that they were instruments of tor∣ture,
and. it struck her, that some poor
wretch had once been fastened in this chair,
and had there been starved to death. She
was chilled by the thought; but, what was
her agony, when, in the next moment, it
occurred to her, that her aunt might have
been one of these victims, and that she
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
herself might be the next! An acute
pain seized her head, she was scarcely able
to hold the lamp, and, looking round for
support, was seating herself, unconsciously,
in the iron chair itself; but suddenly per∣ceiving
where she was, she started from it
in horror, and sprung towards a remote
end of the room. Here again she looked
round for a seat to sustain her, and per∣ceived
only a dark curtain, which, de∣scending
from the cieling to the floor, was
drawn along the whole side of the chamber.
Ill as she was, the appearance of this cur∣tain
struck her, and she paused to gaze
upon it, in wonder and apprehension.</P>
<P>It seemed to conceal a recess of the
chamber; she wished, yet dreaded, to
lift it, and to discover what it veiled:
twice she was withheld by a recollection
of the terrible spectacle her daring hand
had formerly unveiled in an apartment of
the castle, till, suddenly conjecturing,
that it concealed the body of her murdered
aunt, she seized it, in a fit of desperation,
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
and drew it aside. Beyond, appeared a
corpse, stretched on a kind of low couch,
which was crimsoned with human blood,
as was the floor beneath. The features,
deformed by death, were ghastly and hor∣rible,
and more than one livid wound ap∣peared
in the face. Emily, bending over
the body, gazed, for a moment, with an
eager, frenzied eye; but, in the next, the
lamp dropped from her hand, and she
fell senseless at the foot of the couch.</P>
<P>When her senses returned, she found
herself surrounded by men, among whom
was Barnardine, who were lifting her from
the floor, and then bore her along the
chamber. She was sensible of what passed,
but the extreme languor of her spirits did
not permit her to speak, or move, or
even to feel any distinct fear. They car∣ried
her down the stair-case, by which she
had ascended; when, having reached the
arch-way, they stopped, and one of the
men, taking the torch from Barnardine,
opened a small door, that was cut in the
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
great gate, and, as he stepped out upon
the road, the light he bore shewed several
men on horseback, in waiting. Whether
it was the freshness of the air, that revived
Emily, or that the objects she now saw
roused the spirit of alarm, she suddenly
spoke, and made an ineffectual effort to
disengage herself from the grasp of the
ruffians, who held her.</P>
<P>Barnardine, meanwhile, called loudly
for the torch, while distant voices answered,
and several persons approached, and, in the
same instant, a light slashed upon the
court of the castle. Again he vociferated
for the torch and the men hurried Emily
through the gate. At a short distance,
under the shelter of the castle walls, she
perceived the fellow, who had taken the
light from, the porter, holding it to a man,
busily employed in altering the saddle of
a horse, round which were several horse∣men,
looking on, whose harsh features re∣ceived
the full glare of the torch; while the
broken ground beneath them, the oppo∣site
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
walls, with the tufted shrubs, that
overhung their summits, and an embattled
watch-tower above, were reddened with
the gleam, which, fading gradually away,
left the remoter ramparts and the woods
below to the obscurity of night.</P>
<P>“What do you waste time for, there?”
said Barnardine with an oath, as he ap∣proached
the horsemen. “Dispatch—dispatch.”</P>
<P>“The saddle will be ready in a mi∣nute,”
replied the man who was buckling
it, at whom Barnardine now swore again,
for his negligence, and Emily, calling
feebly for help, was hurried towards the
horses, while the ruffians disputed on
which to place her, the one designed for
her not being ready. At this moment
a cluster of lights issued from the great
gates, and she immediately heard the shrill
voice of Annette above those of several
other persons, who advanced. In the
same moment, she distinguished Montoni
and Cavigni, followed by a number of
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
ruffian-faced fellows, to whom she no
longer looked with terror, but with hope,
for, at this instant, she did not tremble at the
thought of any dangers, that might await
her within the castle, whence so lately,
and so anxioussly she had wished to escape.
Those, which threatened her: from without,
had engrossed all her apprehensions.</P>
<P>A short contest ensued between the
parties, in which that of Montoni, how∣ever,
were presently victors, and the
horsemen, perceiving that numbers were
against them, and being, perhaps, not
very warmly interested in the affair
they had undertaken, galloped off, while
Barnardine had run far enough to be lost
in the darkenss, and Emily was led back
into the castle. As she re- passed the
courts, the remembrance of what she had
seen in the portal-chamber came, with all
its horror, to her mind; and when, soon
after, she heard the gate close, that shut
her once more within the castle walls, she
shuddered for herself, and, almost forgetting
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
the danger she had escaped, could
scarcely think, that any thing less precious
than liberty and peace was to be found
beyond them.</P>
<P>Montoni ordered Emily to await him in
the cedar parlour, whither he soon follow∣ed,
and then sternly questioned her on
this mysterious affair. Though she now
viewed him with horror, as the murderer
of her aunt, and scarcely knew what she
said in reply to his impatient enquiries,
her answers and her manner convinced
him, that she had not taken a voluntary
part in the late scheme, and he dismissed
her upon the appearance of his servants,
whom he had ordered to attend, that he
might enquire further into the affair, and
discover those, who bad been accomplices
in it.</P>
<P>Emily had been some time in her apart∣ment,
before the tumult of her mind al∣lowed
her to remember several of the
passed circumstances. Then, again, the
dead form, which the curtain in the por∣tal-chamber
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
had disclosed, came to her
fancy, and she uttered a groan, which
terrified Annette the more, as Emily for∣bore
to satisfy her curiosity, on the sub∣ject
of it, for she feared to trust her with
so fatal a secret, lest her indiscretion
should call down the immediate vengeance
of Montoni on herself.</P>
<P>Thus compelled to bear within her own.
mind the whole horror of the secret, that
oppressed it, her reason seemed to totter
under the intolerable weight. She often
fixed a wild and vacant look on Annette,
and, when she spoke, either did not hear
her, or answered from the purpose. Long
fits of abstraction succeeded; Annette
spoke repeatedly, but her voice seemed
not to make any impression on the sense
of the long agitated Emily, who sat fixed
and silent, except that, now and then, she
heaved a heavy sigh, but without tears.</P>
<P>Terrified at her condition, Annette, at
length, left the room, to inform Montoni
of it, who had just dismissed his servants,
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
without having made any discoveries on
the subject of his enquiry. The wild de∣scription,
which this girl now gave of
Emily, induced him to follow her imme∣diately
to the chamber.</P>
<P>At the sound of his voice, Emily
turned her eyes, and a gleam of recol∣lection
seemed to shoot athwart her mind,
for she immediately rose from her seat, and
moved slowly to a remote part of the
room. He spoke to her in accents some∣what
softened from their usual harshness,
but she regarded him with a kind of half
curious., half terrified look, and answered
only “yes,” to whatever he said. Her
mind still seemed to retain no other im∣pression,
than that of fear.</P>
<P>Of this disorder Annette could give no
explanation, and Montoni, having at∣tempted,
for some time, to persuade
Emily to talk, retired, after ordering An∣nette
to remain with her, during the
night, and to inform him, in the morning,
of her condition.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31"/>
When he was gone, Emily again came
forward, and asked who it was, that had
been there to disturb her. Annette said it
was the Signor—Signor Montoni. Emily
repeated the name after her, several times
as if she did not recollect it, and then sud∣denly
groaned, and relapsed into abstrac∣tion.</P>
<P>With some difficulty, Annette led her
to the bed, which Emily examined with
an eager, frenzied eye, before she lay
down, and then, pointing, turned with
shuddering emotion, to Annette, who, now
more terrified, went towards the door,
that she might bring one of the female
servants to pass the night with them; but
Emily, observing her going, called her by
name, and then in the naturally soft and
plaintive tone of her voice, begged, that
she, too, would not forsake her.—“For
since my father died,” added she, sighing,
“every body forsakes me.”</P>
<P>“Your father, ma'amselle!” said An∣nette,
“he was dead before you knew me.”</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
“He was, indeed!” rejoined Emily,
and her tears began to flow. She now wept
silently and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong, after which, becoming
quite calm, she at length sunk to sleep, An∣nette
having had discretion enough not to
interrupt her tears. This girl, as affection∣ate
as she was simple, lost in these moments
all her former fears of remaining in the
chamber, and watched alone by Emily,
during the whole night.</P>

<BIBL>IL PENSEROSO.</BIBL></Q>
<P>EMILY's mind was refreshed by sleep.
On waking in the morning, she looked
with surprise on Annette, who fat sleeping
in a chair beside the bed, and then en∣deavoured
to recollect herself; but the
circumstances of the preceding night were
swept from her memory, which seemed to
retain no trace of what had passed, and she
was still gazing with surprise on Annette,
when the latter awoke.</P>
<P>“O dear ma'amselle! do you know
me?” cried she</P>
<P>“Know you! Certainly,” replied Emi∣ly,
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
“you are Annette; but why are you
sitting by me thus?”</P>
<P>“O you have been very ill, ma'amselle,
—very ill indeed! and I am fure I
thought—”</P>
<P>“This is very strange!” said Emily, still
trying to recollect the past.—“But I think
I do remember, that my fancy has been
haunted by frightful dreams. Good God!
she added, suddenly starting—“surely it
was nothing more than a dream!”</P>
<P>She fixed a terrified look upon Annertte,
who, intending to quiet her, said “Yes,
ma'amselle, it was more than a dream,
but it is all over now.”</P>
<P>“She <HI>is</HI> murdered, then!” said Emily
in an inward voice, and shuddering in∣stantaneously.
Annette screamed; for,
being ignorant of the circumstance to
which Emily referred, she attributed her
manner to a disordered fancy; but, when
she had explained to what her own speech
alluded, Emily, recollecting the attempt
that had been made to carry her off, asked
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
if the contriver of it had been discover∣ed
Annette replied, that he had not,
though he might easily be guessed at; and
then told Emily she might thank her for
her deliverance, who, endeavouring to
command the emotion, which the remem∣brance
of her aunt had occasioned, appeared
calmly to listen to Annette, though, in
truth, she heard scarcely a word that was
said.</P>
<P>“And so, ma'amselle,” continued the
latter, “I was determined to be even with
Barnardine for refusing to tell me the se∣cret,
by finding it out myself; so I watch∣ed
you, on the terrace, and, as soon as
he had opened the door at the end, I stole
out from the castle, to try to follow you;
for, says I, I am sure no good can be plan∣ned,
or why all this secrecy? So, sure
enough, he had not bolted the door after
him, and, when I opened it, I saw, by the
glimmer of the torch, at the other end of
the passsage, which way you were go∣ing.
I followed the light, at a distance,
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
till you came to the vaults of the chapel,
and there I was afraid to go further, for
I had heard strange things about these
vaults. But then, again, I was afraid to go
back, all in darkenss, by myself; so by the
time Barnardine had trimmed the light, I
had resolved to follow you, and I did so,
till you came to the great court, and there
I was afraid he would see me; so I stopped
at the door again, and watched you across
to the gates, and, when you was gone up
the stairs, I whipt after. There, as I stood
under the gate-way, I heard horses' feet
without, and several men talking; and I
heard them swearing at Barnardine for not
bringing you out, and just then he had
like to have caught me, for he came down
the stairs again, and I had hardly time to
get out of his way. But I had heard enough
of his secret now, and I determined to be
even with him, and to save you, too,
ma'amselle, for I guessed it to be some new
scheme of Count Morano, though he was
gone away. I ran into the castle, but I
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
had hard work to find my way through
the passage under the chapel, and what is
very strange, I quite forgot to look for
the ghosts they had told me about, though
I would not go into that place again by
myself for all the world! Luckily the Sig∣nor
and Signor Cavigni were up, so we
had soon a train at our heels, sufficient to
frighten that Barnardine and his rogues,
all together.</P>
<P>Annette ceased to speak, but, Enriily still
appeared to listen. At length she said,
suddenly, “I think 1 will go to him my∣self;
—where is he?”</P>
<P>Annette asked who was meant.</P>
<P>“Signor Montoni,” replied Emily,
“I would speak with him;” and Annette,
now remembering the order he had given,
on the preceding night, respecting her
young lady, rose, and said she would seek
him herself.</P>
<P>This honest girl's suspicions of Count
Morano were perfectly just; Emily, too,
when she thought on the scheme, had at∣tributed
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
it to him; and Montoni, who had
not a doubt on this subject, also, began
to believe, that it was by the direction of
Morano, that poison had formerly been
mingled with his wine.</P>
<P>The professions of repentance, which
Morano had made to Emily, under the
anguish of his wound, were sincere at the
moment lie offered them; but he had
mistaken the subject of his sorrow, for,
while he thought he was condemning the
cruelty of his late design, he was lament∣ing
only the state of suffering, to which
it had reduced him. As these suffer∣ings
abated, his former views revived,
till, his health being re-established, he
again found himself ready for enterprise
and difficulty. The porter of the castle,
who had served him, on a former occasion,
willingly accepted a second bribe; and,
having concerted the means of drawing
Emily to the gates, Morano publicly left
the hamlet, whither he had been carried
after the affray, and withdrew with his
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
people to another at several miles distance.
From thence, on a night agreed upon by
Barnardine, who had discovered from
the thoughtless prattle of Annette, the
most probabe means of decoying Emily,
the Count sent back his servants to the
castle, while he awaited her arrival at
the hamlet, with an intention of carrying
her immediately to Venice. How this,
his second scheme, was frustrated, has
already appeared; but the violent, and
various passions with which this Italian
lover was now agitated, on his return to
that city, can only be imagined.</P>
<P>Annette having made her report to
Mantoni of Emily's health and of her
request to see him, he replied, that she
might attend him in the cedar room, in
about an hour. It was on the subject, that
pressed so heavily on her mind, that Emily
wished to speak to him, yet she did not
distinctly know what good purpose this
could answer, and sometimes she even re∣coiled
in horror from the expectation of
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
his presence. She wished, also, to peti∣tion,
though she scarcely dared to believe
the request would be granted, that he
would permit her, since her aunt was no
more, to return to her native country.</P>
<P>As the moment of interview approached,
her agitation increased so much, that she
almost resolved to excuse herself under
what could scarcely be called a pretence
of illness; and, when she considered what
could be said, either concerning herself, or
the fate of her aunt, she was equally hope∣less
as to the event of her entreaty, and
terrified as to its effect upon the vengeful
spirit of Montoni. Yet, to pretend igno∣rance
of her death, appeared, in some de∣gree,
to be sharing its criminality, and,
indeed, this event was the only ground,
on which Emily could rest her petition
for leaving Udolpho.</P>
<P>While her thoughts thus wavered, a
message was brought, importing, that mon∣toni
could not see her, till the next day;
and her spirits were then relieved, for<SEG REND="decorInit">a</SEG>
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
moment, from an almost intolerable weight
of apprehension. Annette said, she fancied
the Chevaliers were going out to the wars
again, for the court-yard was filled with
horses, and she heard, that the rest of the
party, who went out before, were expected
at the castle. “And I heard one of the
soldiers, too,” added she, “say to his
comrade, that he would warrant they'd
bring home a rare deal of booty.—So,
thinks I, if the Signor can, with a safe
conscience, send his people out a-robbing—why
it is no business of mine. I only
wish I was once safe out of this castle;
and, if it had not been for poor Ludovico's
sake, I would have let Count Morano's
people run away with us both, for it
would have been serving you a good turn,
ma'amselle, as well as myself.”</P>
<P>Annette might have continued thus
talking for hours for any interruption
she would have received from Emily, who
was silent, inattentive, absorbed in thought,
and passed the whole of this day in a kind
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
of solemn tranquillity, such as is often the
result of faculties overstrained by suffer∣ing.</P>
<P>When night returned, Emily recol∣lected
the mysterious strains of music, that
she had lately heard, in which she still felt
some degree of interest, and of which she
hoped to hear again the soothing sweet∣ness.
The influence of supperstition now
gained on the weakenss of her long-ha∣rassed
mind; she looked, with enthusiastic
expectation, to the guardian spirit of her fa∣ther,
and, having dismised Annette for the
night, determined to watch alone for their
return. It was not yet, however, near the
time when she had heard the music on a
former night, and anxious to call off her
thoughts from distressing subjects, she sat
down with one of the few books, that she
had brought from France; but her mind,
refusing controul, became restless and
agitated, and she went often to the case∣ment
to listen for a sound. Once, she
thought she heard a voice, but then, every
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
thing without the casement remaining still,
she concluded, that her fancy had deceived her.</P>
<P>Thus passed the time, till twelve
o'clock, soon after which the distant
sounds, that murmured through the castle,
ceased, and sleep seemed to reign over all.
Emily then seated herself at the casement,
where she was soon recalled from the re∣verie,
into which she sunk, by very un∣usual
sounds, not of music, but like the
low mourning of some person in diftress.
As she listened, her heart faltered in terror.
and she became convinced, that the former
sound was more than imaginary. Still,
at intervals, she heard a kind of feeble
lamentation, and sought to discover whence
it came. There were several rooms under∣neath,
adjoining the rampart, which had
been long shut up, and, as the sound
probably rose from one of these, she lean∣ed
from the casement to observe, whether
any light was visible there. the cham∣bers,
as far as she could perceive, were
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
quite dark, but, at a little distance, on the
rampart below, she thought she saw some∣thing
moving.</P>
<P>The faint twilight, which the stars shed,
did not enable her to distinguish what it
was; but she judged it to be a sentinel,
on watch, and she removed her light to a
remote part of the chamber, that she
might escape notice, during her further
observation.</P>
<P>The same object still appeared. Pre∣sently,
it advanced along the rampart,
towards her window, and she then diftin∣guished
something like a human form,
but the silcnce, with which it moved, con∣vinced
her it was no sentinel. As it drew
near, she hesitated whether to retire; a
thrilling curiosity inclined her to stay, but
a dread of she scarcely knew what warned
her to withdraw.</P>
<P>While she paused, the figure came op∣posite
to her casement, and was stationary.
Every thing remained quiet; she had not
heard even a foot-fall; and the solemnity
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
of this silence, with the mysterious form
she saw, subdued her spirits, so that she
was moving from the casement, when,
on a sudden, she observed the figure start
away,. and glide down the rampart, after
which it was soon lost in the obscurity of
night. Emily continued to gaze, for
some time, on the way it had passed, and
then retired within her chamber, musing
on this strange circumstance, and scarcely
doubting, that she had witnessed a supper∣natural
appearance.</P>
<P>When her spirits recovered composure,
she looked round for some other explana∣tion.
Remembering what she had heard
of the daring enterprises of Montoni, it
occurred to her, that she had just seen
some unhappy person, who, having been
plundered by his banditti, was brought
hither a captive; and that the music she
had formerly heard, came from him. Yet,
if they had plundered him, it still appeared
improbable, that they should have brought
him to the castle, and it was also more con∣sistent
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
with the manners of banditti to
murder those they rob, than to make them
prisoners. But what, more than any
other circumstance, contradicted the sup∣position,
that it was a prisoner was that
it wandered on the terrrace, without a
guard a consideration, which made her
dismiss immediately her first surmise.</P>
<P>Afterwards, she was inclined to believe,
that Count Morano had obtained ad∣mittance
into the castle; but she soon re∣collected
the difficulties and dangers,
that must have opposed such an enterprise,
and that, if he had so far succeeded, to
come alone and in silence to her casement
at midnight was not the conduct he
would have adopted, particularly since
the private stair-case, communicating with
her apartment, was known to him; neither
would he have uttered the dismal sounds
she had heard.</P>
<P>Another suggestion represented, that
this might be some person, who had de∣signs
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
upon the castle; but the mournful
sounds destroyed, also, that probability.
Thus, enquiry only perplexed her. Who,
or what, it could be that haunted this
lonely hour, complaining in such doleful
accents and in such sweet music (for she
was still inclined to believe, that the former
strains and the late appearance were con∣nected,)
she had no means of ascertaining;
and imagination again assumed her em∣pire,
and roused the mysteries of supper∣stition.</P>
<P>She determined, however, to watch on
the following night, when her doubts
might, perhaps, be cleared up; and she,
almost resolved to adderss the figure, if it
should appear again.</P>

<P>ON the following day, Montoni sent
a second excuse to Emily, who was sur∣prised
at the circumstance. “This is
very strange!” said she to herself. “His
conscience tells him, the purport of my
visit, and he defers it, to avoid an expla∣nation,”
She now almost resolved to
throw herself in his way, but terror check∣ed
the intention, and this day passed, as
the preceding one, with Emily, except
that a degree of awful expectation, con∣cerning
the approaching night, now some∣what
disturbed the dreadful calmness that
had pervaded her mind.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="49"/>
Towards evening, the second part of
the band, which had made the first ex∣cursion
among the mountains, returned
to the castle, where, as they entered the
courts, Emily, in her remote chamber,
heard their loud shouts and strains of ex∣ultation,
like the orgies of furies over some
horrid sacrifice. She even feared they
were about to commit some barbarous
deed; a conjecture from which, however
Annette soon relieved her, by telling,
that the people were only exulting over
the plunder they had brought with them.
This circumstance still further confirmed
her in the belief, that Montoni had really
commenced to be a captain of banditti, and
meant to retrieve his broken fortunes by
the plunder of travellers! Indeed, when
she considered all. the circumstances of his
situation—in an armed, and almost in∣accessible
castle, retired far among the
recesses of wild and solitary mountains,
along whose distant skirts were scattered
towns, and cities, whither wealthy travel∣lers
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
were continually passing—this appeared
to be the situation of all others most suited
for the success of schemes of rapine, and
she yielded to the strange thought, that
Montoni vas become a captain of robbers.
His character also, unprincipled, daunt∣less,
cruel and enterprising, seemed to fit
him for the situation. Delighting in the
tumult and in the struggles of life he was
equally a stranger to pity and to fear; his
very courage was a sort of animal ferocity;
not the noble impulse of a principle, such as
inspirits the mind against the oppressor,
in the cause of the oppressed; but a con∣stitutional
hardiness of nerve, that cannot
feel, and that, therefore, cannot fear.</P>
<P>Emily's supposition, however natural,
was in part erroneous, for she was a stranger
to the state of this country and to the
circumstances, under which its frequent
wars were partly conducted. The reve∣nues
of the many states of Italy being, at
that time, insufficient to the support of
standing armies, even during the short
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
periods, which the turbulent habits both
of the governments and the people permit∣ted
to pass in peace, an order of men arose
not known in our age, and but faintly de∣scribed
in the history of their own. Of the
soldiers, disbanded at the end of every war,
few returned to the sase, but unprositable
occupations, then usual in peace. Some∣times
they passed into other countries, and
mingled with armies, which still kept the
field. Sometimes they formed themselves
into bands of robbers and occupied
remote fortresses, where their desperate
character, the weakness of the govern∣ments
which they offended, and the
certainty, that they could be recalled to
the armies, when their, presence should be
again wanted, prevented them from being
much pursued by the civil power; and,
sometimes, they attached themselves to the
fortunes of a popular chief by whom they
were led into the service of any state, which
could settle with. him the price of their va∣lour
From this latter practice arose their
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
name—<HI>condo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieri;</HI> a term formidable all
over Italy, for a period, which concluded
in the earlier part of the seventeen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cen∣tury,
but of which it is not so easy to ascertain
the commencement.</P>
<P>Contests between the smaller states were
then, for the most part, affairs of enter∣prize
alone, and the probabilities of success
were estimated, not from the skill
but from the personal courage of the ge∣neral,
and the soldiers. The ability
which was necessary to the-conduct of te∣dious
operations, was little valued. It
was enough to know how a party might
be led towards their enemies, with the
greatest secresy, or conducthed from them
in the compactest order. The officer was
to precipitate himself into a sicuation,
where, but for his example, the soldiers
might not have ventured; and, as the op∣posed
parties knew little of each other's
strength, the event of, the day was fre∣quently
determined by the boldness of
the first movements. In such services the
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
<HI>Condottieri</HI> were eminent, and in these, where
plunder always followed success, their cha∣racters
acquired a mixture of intrepidity
and profligacy, which awed even those
whom they servcd.</P>
<P>When they were not thus engaged,
their chief had usually his own soitress, in
which, or in its neighbourhood, they en∣joyed
an irksome rest and, though their
wants were, at one time, partly supplied
from the property of the inhabitants, the
lavish distribution of their plunder at
others, prevented them from being ob∣noxious;
and the peasants of such districts
gradually shared the character of their
warlike visitors. The neighbouring go∣vernments
sometimes psofessed, but sel∣dom
endeavoured, to suppress these mili∣tary
communities; both because it was
difficult to do so, and because a disguised
protection of them ensured, for the ser∣vice
of their wars, a body of men, who
could not otherwise be so cheaply main∣tained
or so persectly qualified. The
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
commanders sometimes even relied so far
upon this policy of the several powers,
as to frequent their capitals; and Mon∣toni,
having met them in the gaming par∣ties
of Venice and Padua, conceived a de∣sire
to emulate their characters, before his
ruined fortunes tempted him to adopt their
practices. It was for the arrangement of
his present plan of life, that the midnight
councils were held at his mansion in Ve∣nice,
and at which Orsino and some
other members of the present community then
assisted with suggestions, which they had
since executed with the wreck of their
fortunes.</P>
<P>On the return of night, Emily resumed
her station at the casement. There was
now a moon; and, as it rose over the
tusted woods, its yellow light served to
shew the lonely terrace and the surround∣ing
objects, more distinctly, than the twi∣light
of the stars had done, and promised
Emily to assist her observations, should
the mysterious form return. On this sub∣ject,
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
she again wavered in corrjecture, and
hesitated whether to speak to the figure, to
which a slrong and almost irresistible in∣terest
urged her; but terror, at intervals,
made her reluctant to do so.</P>
<P>“If this is a person who has designs
upon the castle,” said she,-“my curiosity
may prove fatal to me; yet the rnyste∣rious
music, and the lamentations I heard,
must surely have proceeded from him:
if so, he cannot be an enemy.”</P>
<P>She then thought of her unfortunate
aunt, and, shuddering wich grief and horror,
the suggestions of imagination seized hermind with all the force of truth, and she be∣lieved,
that the form she had seen was su∣pernatural.
She trembled, breathed with
difficulty, an icy coldness touched her
cheeks, and her fears for a while over∣came
her judgment. Her resolution now
forsook her, and she determined, if the
figure should appear, not to speak to it.</P>
<P>Thus the time passed, as she sat at her
casement, awed by expectation, and by
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
the gloom and stillness of midnight; for
she saw obseurely in the moon-light only
the mountains and woods, a cluster of
towers, that sormed the west angle of the
castle, and the terrace below; and heard
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sound, except, now and then, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onely watch-word, passed by the centinels
on duty, and afterwards the sleps of the
men who came to relieve guard, and whom
she knew at a distance. on the rampart by
their pikes, that glittered in the moon∣beam,
and then, by the few short words,
in. which they hailed their fellows of the
night. Emily retired within her chamber,
while they psssed the casement. When
she returned to it, all was again quiet. It
was now very late, she was wearied with
watching, and began to doubt the reality
of what she had seen on the preceding
night; but she still lingered at the window,
for her mind was too perturbed to admit
of sleep. The moon shone with a clear
lustre, that afforded her a complete view
of the terrace; but she saw only a solitary
ccntinel, pacing at one. end of it and, at
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
length, tired with expectation, she with∣drew
to seek rest.</P>
<P>Such, however, was the impression, left
on her mind by the music, and the com∣plaining
she had formerly heard, as well as
by the figure, which she fancied she had
seen, that she determined to repeat the
watch, on the following night.</P>
<P>Montoni, on the next day, took no
notice of Emily's appointed visit, but she,
more anxious than before to see him, sent
Annette to enquire, at what hour he would
admit her. He mentioned eleven o'clock,
and Emily was punctual to the moment;
at which she called up all her fortitude to
support the shock of his presence and the
dreadsul recollections it enforced. He
was with several of his officers, in the cedar∣room
on observing whom she paused; and her
agitation increased, while he con∣tinned
to converse with them, apparently
not observing her, till some of his officers,
turning round, saw Emily, and uttered an
exclamation. She was hastily retiring,
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
when Montoni's voice arrested her, and,
in a faultering accent,she said,—“I would
peak with you, Signor Montoni, if you are
at leisure.”</P>
<P>“These are my friends,” he replied,
“whatever you would fay”, they may
heir”</P>
<P>Emily, Without replying, turned from
the rude gaze of the cheva<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irs, and Mon∣toni
then followed her to the hall, whence
he led her to a small room, of which he
shut the door with violence As she
looked on his dark countenance, she again
thought she saw the murderer of her aunt;
and her mind was so convulsed with horror,
that she had not power to recal thought
enough to explain the purport of her visit;
and to trust herself with the mention of
Madame Montoni was more than she
dared.</P>
<P>Montoni at length impatiently enquired
what she had to say? “1 have no time
for trifling,” he added, “my moments
are important.”</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59"/>
Emily then told him, that she wished to
return to France, and came to beg, that
he would permit her to do so.—But when,
he looked surprised, and enquired for the
motive of the request, she hesitated, be∣came
paler than before, trembled, and had
nearly sunk at his feet. He observed her
emotion, with apparent indifference, and
interrupted the silerice by telling her, he
must be gone. Emily, however, recalled
her spirits suffciently to enable her to re∣peat
her request. And, when Montoni
absolutely resused it, her slumbering mind
was roused.</P>
<P>“I can no longer remain here with pro∣priety,
fir,” said she, “and I may be al∣lowed
to ask, by what right you detain
me.”</P>
<P>“It is my will that you remain here,”
said Montoni, laying his hand on the door
to go;“let that suffice you.”</P>
<P>Emily, considering that she had no ap∣peal
from this will, forbore to dispute his
right, and made a feeble effort to persuade
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
him to be just. “while my aunt lived,
fir,” said she, in a tremulous voice, “my
residence here was not improper; but now,
that she is no more, I may surely be per∣mitted
to depart. My stay cannot bene∣fit
you, sir, and will only distress me,”</P>
<P>“Who told you, that Madam Montoni
was dead?” said Montoni, with an inqui∣fitive
eye. Emily hesitated, for nobody
had told her so, and she did not dare to
avow the having seen that spectacle in the
portal-chamber, which had compelled her
to the belief.</P>
<P>“Who told you so?” he repeated, more∣sternly.</P>
<P>“Alas! I know it too well,” replied
Emily: “spare me on this terrible sub∣ject!”</P>
<P>She fat down on a bench to support
herself.</P>
<P>“If you with to fee her,” said Montoni,
“you may; she lies in the east turret.</P>
<P>He now left the room, without awaiting
her reply, and returned to the cedar cham∣ber,
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
ber, where such of the chevaliers as had
not before seen Emily, began to rally him,
on the discovery they had made; but Mon∣toni
did not appear dispoled to bear this
mirth, and they changed the subject.</P>
<P>Having talked with the subtle Orsino,
on the plan of an excursion, which he
meditated for a suture day, his friend ad∣vifed,
that they sould lie in wait for the
enemy, which Verezzi impetuously op∣pofed,
reproached Orsino with want of
spirit, and swore, that, if Montoni would
let him lead on fifty men, he would con∣quer
all that should oppose him.</P>
<P>Orsino smiled contemptuously;Mon∣toni
smiled too, but he also lisbened. Ve∣rezzi
then proceeded with vehement decla∣mation
and asertion, till he was stopped
by an argument of Orsino, which he knew
not how to answer better than by invective.
His sierce spirit detested the cunning cau∣tion
of Orsino, whom he constantly op∣pofed,
and whose inveterate, though silent,
hatred he had long ago incurred. And
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
Montoni was a calm observer of both,
whose different qualifications he knew,
and how to bend their opposite character
to the perfection of his own designs. But
Verezzi, in the heat of opposicion, now
did not scruple to accuse Orsino of cow∣ardice,
at which the countenance of the
latter, while he made no reply, was over∣spread
with a livid paleness; and Mon∣toni,
who watched his lurking eye, saw
him put his hand hastily into his bosorn.
But Verezzi, whose face, glowing with
crimson, formed a striking contrast to the
complexion of Orsino, remarked not the
action, and continued boldly declaiming
against cowards to Cavigni,. who was slily
laughing at his vehemence, and at the
silent mortification of Orsino, when the
latter, retiring a few steps behind, drew
forth, a stilletto to stab his adversary in: the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>back. Montoni arrested his half-extended
arm, and, with a signisicant look, made
him return the poinard into his bosom,
unseen by all except himself; for most of
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
the party were disputing at a distant win∣dow,
on the situation of a dell where they meant
to form an ambuscade.</P>
<P>When<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Verezzi had turned round, the
deadly hatred, expressed on the features of
his opponent, raifing, for the first time, a
suspicion of his intention, he laid his
hand on his sword, and then, seerning to
recollect himself, strode up to Montoni.</P>
<P>“Signor,” said he, with a significant
look at Orsino, “we are not a band of as∣sassins;
if you have business for brave men
employ me on this expedition: you shall
have the laft drop of my blood; if you
have only work for cowards—keep him,”
pointing to Orsino, “and let me quit
Udolpho.”</P>
<P>Orsino, still more incensed, again drew
forth his stilletto, and rushed towards Ve∣rezzi,
who, at the fame instant, advanced
with his sword, when Montoni and the rest
of the party interfered and eparated them.</P>
<P>“This is the conduct of a boy,” said
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
Montoni to Verezzi, “not of a man: be
more moderate in your speech.”</P>
<P>“Moderation is the virtue of cowards,”
retorted Verezzi; “they are moderate
in every thting—but in fear.”</P>
<P>“I accept your words,” raid Montoni,
turning upon him with a fierce and haughty
look, and drawing his sword out of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cabbard.</P>
<P>“With all my heart,” cried Verezzi,
“though I did not mean them for you.”</P>
<P>He directed a pass at Montoni; and,
while they fought, the villain Orsino made
another attempt to stab Verezzi, and was
again prevented.</P>
<P>The combatants were, at length, sepa∣rated;
and, after a very long and violent
dispute, reconciled. Montoni then left
the room with Orsino, whom he detained in
private consultation for a considerable time.</P>
<P>Emily, meanwhile, stunned by the last
words of Montoni, forgot, for the moment,
his declaration, that she should continue in
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
the castle, while she thought of her unfor∣tunate
aunt, who, he had said, was laid in
the east turret. In suffering the remains
of his wife to lie thus long unburied, there
appeared a degree of brutality more shock∣ing
than she had supected even Montoni could practise</P>
<P>After a long struggle, she determined to
accept his permission to visit the turret,
and to take a last look of her ill-fated aunt:
with which design she returned to her
chamber, and, while she waited for An∣nette
to accompany her, endeavoured to
acquire fortitude sufficient to support her
through the approaching seene; for,
though she trembled to encounter it, she
knew that to remember the performance of
this last act of duty would hereafter afford
her consoling satisfaction.</P>
<P>Annette came, and Emily mentioned
her purpose, frorn whieh the former en∣deavoured
to dissuade her, though without
effect, and Annette was, with much difficulty,
prevailed upon to acconapany
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
her to the turret; but no consideration
could make her promise to enter the cham∣ber
of death.</P>
<P>They now lest the corridor, and, having
reached the foot of the stair-case, which
Emily had formerly ascended, Annette
declared she would go no further, and
Emily proceeded alone. When she saw
the track of blood, which she had before
jobserved, her spirits fainted, and, being
compelled to rest on the stairs, she almost
determined to proceed no further. The
pause of a few moments restored her resolu∣tion,
and she went on.</P>
<P>As she drew near the landings∣place,
upon which the upper chamber opened,
she remembered, that the door was formerly
fastened, and apprehended, that it might
still be so. In this expectation, however,
she was mistaken; for the door opened
at once, into a dusky and silent chamber,
round which she fearfully looked, and
then slowly advanced, when a hollow voice
spoke. Emily, who was unable to speak,
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
or to move from the spot, uttered no found
of terror. The voice spoke again; and,
then, thinking that it resembled that of Ma∣dame
Montoni, Emily's spirits were instantly
roused; she rushed towards a bed, that
stood in a remote part of the room, and
drew aside the curtains Within, appeared
a pale and emaciated face. She started
back, then again advanced, shuddered as
she took up the skeleton hand, that lay
stretched upon the quilt; then let it drop,
and then viewed the face with a long, un∣fettled
gaze. It was that of Madam Mon∣toni,
though so changed by illness, that the
resemblance of what it had been, could
scarcely be traced in what it now appeared.
She was still alive, and, raising her heavy
eyes, she turned them on her niece.</P>
<P>“Where have you been so long?” said
she, in the same hollow tone, “I thought
you had forsaken me.”</P>
<P>“Do you indeed live,” said Emily, at
length, “or is this but a terrible appari∣tion?”
She received no answer, and again
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
she snatched up the hand. “This is sub∣stance,”
she exclaimed, “but it is cold—cold
as marble!” She let it fall “O,
if you really live, speak!” said Emily, in a
voice of desperation, “that I may not
lose my senses—say you know me!”</P>
<P>“I do live,” replied Madame Montoni,
“ but—I feel that I am about to die.”</P>
<P>Emily clasped the hand she held, more
eagerly, and groaned. They were both
silent for some moments. Then Emily
endeavoured to soo ther her, and, enquired▪
what had reduced her to this present de∣plorable
state.</P>
<P>Montoni, when he removed her to the
turret under the improbable suspicion of
having attempted his life, had ordered the
men employed on the occasion, to observe
a strict secrecy concerning her. To this
be was influenced by a double motive.
He meant to debar her from the comfort of
Emily's visits, and to secure an opportunity
of privately dispatching her, should any
new circumstances occur to confirm the
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
present suggestions of his suspeting mind.
His consciousness of the hatred he deserved
it was natural enough should at first lead
him to attribute to her the attempt that
had been made upon his life; and, though
there was no other reason to believe that
she was concerned in that atrocious design,
his suspicions remained; he continued to
confine her in the turret, under a strict
guard; and, without pity or remorse, had
suffered her to lie, forlorn and neglected,
under a raging fever, till it had reduced
to the present state.</P>
<P>The track of blood, which Emily had
seen on the stairs, had flowed from the un∣bound
wound of one of the men employed
to carry Madame Montoni, and which he
had received in the late affray. At night
these men, having contented themselves
with securing the door of their prisoner's
room, had retired from guard; and then
it was, that Emily, at the time of her first
enquiry, had found the turret so silent and
deserted.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70"/>
When she had attempted to open the
door of the chamber, her aunt was sleep∣ing,
and this occasioned the silence, which
had contributed to delude her into a belief
that she was no more; yet had her terror
permitted her to persevere longer in the
call, she would probably have awakened
Madame Montoni, and have been spared
much suffering. The spectacle in the
portal-chamber, which afterwards con∣firmed
Emily's horrible suspicion, was the
corpse of a man, who had fallen in the af∣fray,
and the same which had been borne
into the servants' hall, where she took re∣fuge
from the tumult. This man had lin∣gered
under his wounds for some days;
and, soon after his death, his body had
been removed on the couch, on which he
died, for interment in the vault beneath
the chapel, through which Emily and Bar∣nardine
had passed to the chamber.</P>
<P>Emily, after asking Madame Montoni a
thousand questions concerning herself, lest
her, and sought Montoni; for the more
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
solemn interest she felt for her aunt, made
her now regardless of the resentment her
remonstrances might draw upon herself,
and of the improbability of his granting
what she meant to entreat.</P>
<P>“Madame Montoni is now dying, fir,”
said Emily, as soon as the saw him—“Your
resentment, surely will not pursue her to
the last moment! Suffer her to be removed
from that forlorn room to her own apart∣ment,
and to have necessary comforts ad∣ministcred.”</P>
<P>“Of what service will that be, if she is
dying?”: said Montoni, with apparent in∣difference.</P>
<P>“The service, at least, of saving you,
sir, from a few of those pangs of conscience
you must suffer, when you shall be in the
same situation,” said Emily, with impru∣dent
indignation, of which Montoni soon
made her sensible, by commanding her to
quit his presence. Then, forgetting her re∣sentment,
and impressed only by compassion
for the piteous state of her aunt, dying
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
Without succour, she submitted to humble
herself to Montoni, and to adopt every
persuasive means, that might reduce him to
relent towards his wife.</P>
<P>For a considerable time he was proof
against all she said, and all she looked;
but at length the divinity of pity, beam∣ing
in Emily's eyes, seemed to touch his
heart. He turned away, ashamed of his
better feelings, half fallen and half relent∣ing;
but finally consented, that his wife
should be removed to her own apartment,
and that Emily should attend her. Dread∣ing
equally, that this relief might arrive too
late, and that Montoni might retract his
conceffion, Emily scarcely staid to thank
him for it, but assisted by Annette, she
quickly prepared Madame Montoni's bed,
and they carried her a cordial, that might
enable her feeble frame to sustain the fa∣tigue
of a removal.</P>
<P>Madame was scarcely arrived in her
own apartment, when an order was given
by her husband, that she should remain in
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
the turret; but Emily, thanksul that she
had made such dispatch, hastened to inform
him of it, as well as that a second removal
would instantly prove fatal, and he suffered
his wife to continue where she was.</P>
<P>During this day, Emily never left
Madame Montoni, except to prepare
such little nourishing things as she
judged necessary to sustain her, and which
Madame Montoni received with quiet ac∣quiescence,
though she feemed sensible
that they could not save her from approach∣ing
dissolution, and scarcely appeared to
wish. for life. Emily meanwhile watched
over her with the most tender solicitude,
no longer seeing her imperious aunt in
the poor object before her, but the sister of
her late beloved father, in a situation
that called for all her compassion and
kindness. When night came, she deter∣mined
to sit up with her aunt, but this the
latter positively forbade, commanding her
to retire to rest, and Annette alone to re∣main
in her chamber. Rest was, indeed,
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
necessary to Emily, whose spirits and
frame were equally wearied by the occur∣rences
and exertions of the day; but she
would not leave Madame Montoni, till
after the turn of midnight, a period then
thought fo critical by the physicians.</P>
<P>Soon after twelve, having enjoined
Annette to be wakesul, and to call her,
should any change appear for the worse,
Emily sorrowfully bade Madame Montoni
good night, and withdrew to her cham∣ber.
Her spirits were more than usually
depressed by the piteous condition of her
aunt, whose recovery she scarcely dared to
expect. To her own misfortunes she saw
no period, inclosed as she was, in a re∣mote
castle, beyond the reach of any
friends, had she possessed such, and be∣yond
the pity even of strangers; while
she knew herself to be in the power of a
man capable, of any action, which his in∣terest,
or his ambition, might suggest.</P>
<P>Occupied by melancholy reflections and
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
by anticipations as fad, she did not retire
immediately to rest, but leaned thought∣fully
on her open casement. The scene
before her of woods and mountains, re∣posing
in the moon-light, formed a re∣gretted
contrast with the state of her mind;
but the lonely murmur of these woods, and
the view of this sleeping landscape, gra∣dually
soothed her emotions and sostened
her to tears.</P>
<P>She continued to weep, for some time,
lost to every thing, but to a gentle sen00e of
her misfortunes. When she, at length,
took the handkerchief from her eyes, she
perceived, before her, on the terrace
below, the figure she had formerly ob∣served,
which stood fixed and silent im∣mediately
opposite to her casement. On
perceiving it, she started back, and terror
for some time overcame curiosity;—at
length, she returned to the casement, and
still the figure was before it, which she
now compelled herself to observe, but was
utterly unable to speak, as she had for∣merly
intended. The moon shone with
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
a clear light, and it was, perhaps, the
agitation of her mind, that prevented her
distinguishing, with any degree of accuracy,
the form before her. It was still station∣ary,
and she began to doubt, whether it
was really animated.</P>
<P>Her scattered thoughts were now so far
returned as to remind her, that her light ex∣posed
her to dangerous observation, and she
was stepping back to remove it, when she
perceived the figure move, and then wave
what seemed to be its arm, as if to beckon
her; and, while she gazed, fixed in fear,
it repeated the action. She now attempted
to speak, but the words died on her lips,
and she went from the casement to remove
her light; as she was doing which, she
heard, from without, a faint groan. Listen∣ing
but not daring to return, she pre∣sently
heard it repeated.</P>
<P>“Good God!—what can this mean!”
said he.</P>
<P>Again she listened, but the sound came
no more; and, after along interval of
silence, she recovered courage enough to
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
go to the casement, when she again few
the same appearance! It beckoned again,
and again uttered a low found.</P>
<P>“That groan was surely human!” said
she. “I <HI>will</HI> speak.” “Who is it,”
cried Emily in a faint voice, “that wan∣ders
at this late hour?”</P>
<P>The figure raised its head but suddenly
started away, and glided down the terrace.
She watched it, for a long while, passing
swistly in the moon-light, but heard no
footslep, till a senrinel from the other ex∣tremity
of the rampart walked slowly along.
The man slopped under her window, and,
looking up, called her by name. She
was retiring precipitately, but, a second
smmons inducing her to reply, the sol∣dier
then respectsully asked if the had
seen any thing pass. On her answering
that she had; he said no more, but walked
away down the terrace, Emily following
him with her eyes, till he was loft in the
distance. But, as he was on guard, she
knew he could not go beyond the rampart,
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
and, therefore, resolved to await his re∣turn.</P>
<P>Soon after, his voice was heard, at a
distance, calling loudly; and then a voice
still more distant answered, and, in the
next moment, the watch-word was given,
and passed along the terrace. As the
soldiers moved hastily under the casement,
she called to enquire what had happened,
but they passed without regarding her.</P>
<P>Emily's thoughts returning to the figure
she had seen, “It cannot be a person,
who has designs upon the, castle,” said
she; “such an one would conduct himself
very differently. He would not venture
where sentinels were on watch, nor fix
himself opposite to a window, where he
perceived he must be observed; much
less would he beckon, or utter a sound of
complaint. Yet it cannot be a prisoner,
for how could he obtain the opportunity
to wander thus?”</P>
<P>If she had been subject to vanity,she
might have supposed this figure to be fome
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
inhabitant of the castle, who wandered un∣der
her casement in the hope of feeing her,
and of being allowed to declare his ad∣migration;
but this opinion never occurred,
to Emily, and, if it had, she would have
dismissed it as improbable, on considering,
that, when, the opportunity of speaking had
occurred, it had been suffered to pass in
silence; and that, even at the moment in.
which she had spoken, the form had ab∣ruptly
quitted the place.</P>
<P>While the mused, two sentinels walked
up the rampart in earnest conversation, of
which she caught a few words, and learned
from these, that one of their comrades
had fallen down senseless. Soon after,
three other soldiers appeared slowly ad∣vancing
from the bottom, of the terrace,
but she heard only a low voice, that came
at intervals. As they drew near, she per∣ceived
this to be the voice of him, who
walked in the middle, apparently supported
by his comrades; and she again, called to
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
when enquiring what had happened.
the found of her voice, they stopped,
and looked up, while she repeated her ques∣tion,
and was told, that Roberto, their
fellow of the watch, had been seized with
a sit, and that his cry, as he fell, had
caused a false alarm.</P>
<P>“Is he subject to fits?” said Emily.</P>
<P>“Yes, Signora,” replied Roberto; “but
if 1 had not, what I saw was enough to
have frightened the Pope himself.”</P>
<P>“What was it?” enquired Emily, trembling.</P>
<P>“I cannot tell what it was, lady, or
what I saw, or how it vanisied,” replied
the soldier who seemed to shudder at the
recollection.</P>
<P>“Was it the person, whom you followed
down the rampart, that has occasioned
you this alarm?” said Emily, endeavour∣ing
to conceal her own.</P>
<P>“Person!” exclaimed the man,—“it
was the devil, and this is not the first
time 1 have feen him!”</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"/>
“Nor will it be the last observed one
of his comrades, laughing.</P>
<P>“No, no, 1 warrant not,” said another.</P>
<P>“Well,”rejoined Roberto, “you may
be as merry now, as you please; you was
none so jocose the other night, Sebaslian,
when you was on watch with Launcelot.</P>
<P>“Launcelot need not talk of that,”
replied Sebastian, “let him remember
how he stood trembling, and unable to
give the <HI>word,</HI> till the man was gone. If
the man had not come so silently upon us,
I would have feized him, and soon made
him tell who he was.”</P>
<P>“What man?” enquired Emily.</P>
<P>“It was no man, lady,” said Launce∣lot,
who stood by, “but the devil him∣self
as my comrade fays. What man
who does not live in the castle, could
get within the walls at midnight? Why,
I might just. as well' pretend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to march to
Venice, and' get among all the Senators,
when they are counselling; and I warrant
I Should have more chance of getting out
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
again alive, than any fellow, that we
should catch within the gates after dark.
So I think I have proved plainly enough,
that this can be nobody that lives out of
the castle; and now I will, prove, that it
can be no nobody that lives in the castle
—for, if he did—why should he be afraid
to be seen? So after this, I hope nobody
will pretend to tell me it was anybody.
No, I say again, by holy Pope.! it was
the devil, and Sebasian, there, knows this
is not the first time we have seen him.”</P>
<P>“When did you see the figure, then,
before?” said Emily half smiling, who,
though she thought the conversation some∣what
too much, selt, an interest, which
would not permit her to conclude it.</P>
<P>“About a week ago, lady,” said Sebas∣tian,
taking up the slory,”</P>
<P>“And where?”</P>
<P>“On the rampart, lady, higher up,”</P>
<P>“Did you pursue it, that it sled?”</P>
<P>“No, Signora. Launcelot and I were
on watch together, and every thing was
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
so still, you might have heard a mouse
stir, when, suddenly, Launcelot says—Se∣bastian!
do you see nothing? I turned my
head a little to the left, as it might be—thus
No, says I Hush! said Launce∣lot,
—look yonder—just by the last cannon
on the rampart! I looked, and then
thought I did see something move; but
there being no light, but what the stars
gave, I could not be certain. We stood
quite silent, to watch it, and presently saw
something pass along the castle wall just
opposite to us!”</P>
<P>“Why did not you seize it, then?” cried
a soldier, who had scarcely spoken till now.</P>
<P>“Aye, why did you not seize it?” said
Roberto.</P>
<P>“You should have been there to have
done that,” replied Sebastian. “You
would have been, bold enough to have
taken it by the throat, though it had been
the devil himself; we could not take such
a liberty, perhaps because we are not so
well acquainted with him, as you are.
But, as I was saying, it stole by us so
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
quickly that we had not time to get rid
of our surprise, before it was gone. Then,
we knew it was in vain to follow. We
kept constant watch all that night, but
we saw it no more. Next morning, we
told some of our Comrades,. who were on
duty on other parts of the ramparts,
what we had seen; but they had seen
nothing, and laughed at us, and it was
not till to-night, that the same figure walked
again,”</P>
<P>“Where did you lose it, friend?” said
Emily to Roberto.</P>
<P>“When 1, les<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you, lady,” replied the
man “you might see me go down the
rampart, but it was not till I reached the
east terrace, that I saw any thing. Then,
the moon shining. bright, I saw something
like a sdow slitting before me, as it
were, at some distance. I stopped, when
I turned the corner of the east tower,
where I had seen this figure not a moment
before,—but it was gone! As I stood,
looking through the old arch, which leads
to the east rampart, and where I am sure
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
it had passed, I heard, all of a sudden,
such a found!—It was not like a groan,
or a cry, or a shout, or any thing I ever
heard in my, life. I heard it only once,
and that was enough for me; for I know
nothing that happened after, till I found
my comrades, here, about me.”</P>
<P>“Come,” said Sebastian, let us go to
our posts—the moon is setting. Good
night, lady!”</P>
<P>“Aye, let us go,” rejoined Roberto.
Good nig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, lady.”</P>
<P>“Good<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>night; the holy mother guard
you!” faid Emily, as she closed her case∣ment
and retired to reflect upon the strange
circumstance that had just occurred, con∣necting
which with what had happened on
former nights, she endeavoured to derive
from the whole something more positive,
than conjecture. But her imagination
was inflamed, while her judgment was not
enlightened, and the terrors of superstition.
again pervaded her mind.</P>

<L>Besides thine things, that we have heard and secn,</L>
<L>Recounts most horrid sights, seen by the watch.”</L>
<BIBL>JULIUS CAESAR.</BIBL></Q>
<P>IN the morning, Emily found Madame
Montoni nearly in the fame condition, as
on the preceding night; she had slept lit∣tle,
and that little had not refreshed her;
she smiled on her niece, and seemed cheered
by her presence, but spoke only a few
words, and never named Montoni, who,
however, soon after entered the room. His
wife, when she understood that he was
there, appeared much agitated, but was en∣tirely
filent, till Emily rose from a chair at
the bed-side, when she begged, in a see∣ble
voice, that she would not leave her.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87"/>
The visit of Montoni was not to sooth
his wife whom he knew to be dying, or
to consble, or to ask her forgiveness, but to
make a last effort to procure that signature,
which would transfer her estates in Lan∣guedoc,
after her death, to him rather than
to Emily. This was a scene, that exhi∣bited,
on his part, his usual inhumanity,
and, on that of Madame montoni, a per∣fevering
spirit, contending with a feeble
frame; while Emily repeatedly declared
to him her willingness to resign all claim
to those estates, rather than that the last
hours of her aunt should be disturbed by
contention. Montoni, however, did not
leave the room, till his wife, exhausted by
the obtinate dispute, had fainted, and she
lay so long insensible, that Emily began
to fear that the spark of life was extin∣guished.
At length, she revived, and, look∣ing
feebly up at her niece, whose tears were
falling over her, made an effort to speak,
but her words were unintelligible, and
Emily again apprehended she was dying.
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
Afterwards, however, she recovered her
speech, and, being somewhat restored by a
cordial, conversed for a considerable time,
on the subject of' her estates In France,
with clearness and precision. She directed
her niece where to find some papers relative
to them, which she had hitherto concealed
From the search of Montoni, and earnestly
charged her never to suffer these papers to
escape her.</P>
<P>Soon after this conversation, Madame
Montoni sunk into a dose, and continued
slumbering, till evening, when she. seemed
better than she had been since her removal
from the turret Emily never left her, for
a moment, till, long after midnight, and
even then would not have quitted the room,
had not. her aunt entreated, that she would
retire to rest. She then obeyed, the more
willingly, because her patient appeared
somewhat recruited by sleep; and, giving
Annette the same injunction, as on the
preceding night, she withdrew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her own
apartment. But her spirits were wakesul
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
and agitated, and, finding it impossible to
sleep, she determined to watch, once more,
for the mysterious appearance, that had so
much interested and alarmed, her.</P>
<P>It was now the second watch of the
night, and▪ about the time when the figure
had before appeared. Emily <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heard the
pasing steps of the sentinels, on the ram∣part,
as they changed guard; and, when all
was again silent, she took her station at the
casement, leaving her lamp in a remote
part of the chamber, that she might escape
notice, from without. The moon gave a
faint and uncertain light, for heavy vapours
surrounded it, and, often rolling over the
disk, left the scene below in total dark∣ness
It was- in one of these moments of
obscurity, that she observed a small and
lambent flame, moving at some distance on
the terrace. While she gazed, it disap∣peared,
and, the moon again emerging
from the lurid and heavy thunder clouds,
she turned her attention to the heavens,
where the vivid lightnings darted from
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
claud to cloud, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ashed silently on the
woods below. She loved to catch, in the
momentary gleam, the gloomy landscape.
Sometimes, a cloud opened its light upon
a distant mountain, and, while the sudden
splentdout illumined all its recesses of
rock and wood, the rest of the scene re∣mained
in deep shadow; at others, partial
features of the castle were revealed by the
glimpse—the antient arch leading to the
east rampart, the turret above, or the for∣tifications
beyond; and then, perhaps, the
whole edisice with all its towers, its dark
massy walls and pointed casements would
appear, and vanish in an instant.</P>
<P>Emily, looking again upon the rampart,
perceived the slame she had seen before;
it moved onward; and, soon after, she
thought she heard a footstep. The light
appeared and disappeared frequently, while,
as she watched, it glided under her cafe∣ments,
and, at the fame nstant, she was
certain, that a footstep passed, but the
darkness did not permit her to distinguish
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
any object except the flame. It moved
away, and then, by a gleam of lightning,
she perceived some person on the terrace.
All the anxieties of the preceding night re∣turned.
This person advanced, and the play∣ing
flame alternately appeared and vanished.
Emily wished to speak, to end her doubts,
whether this figure were human or super∣natural;
but her courage failed as often
as she attempted utterance, till the light
moved again under the casement, and she
faintly demanded, who passed.</P>
<P>“A. friend,” replied a voice.</P>
<P>“What friend?” said Emily, somewhat
encouraged, “who are you, and what is that light you carry?”</P>
<P>“I am Anthonio, one of the Signor's
soldiers,” replied the voice.</P>
<P>“And what is that tapering light you
bear?” said Emily, “See how it darts up∣wards,—and now it vanishes!”</P>
<P>“This light, lady,” said the soldier,
“has appeared to-night as you see it, on
the point of my lance, ever since I have
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
been on watch; but what it means I can
not tell.”</P>
<P>“This is very strange!” said. Emily.</P>
<P>“My fellow-guard,” continued the man,
“has the same flame on his arms; he says
he has sometimes seen it before. I never
did; I am but lately come to the castle,
for I have not been, long a soldier.”</P>
<P>“ How does your comrade account for
it?” said Emily.</P>
<P>“He says it is an omen, lady, and
bodes no good.”</P>
<P>“And what harm can it bode?” rejoin∣ed
Emily.</P>
<P>“He knows not so much as that, lady.”</P>
<P>Whether Emily was alarmed by this
omen, or not, she certainly was relieved
from much terror by discovering this man
to be only a soldier on duty, and it imme∣diately
occurred to her, that it might be
he, who had occasioned so much alarm on
the preceding night. There were, how∣ever,
some circumstances, that still required
explanation. As far as she could judge
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
by the faint moon-light, that had assisted
her observation, the figure she had seen did
not resemble this man either in shape or
size; besides, she-was certain it had carried
no arms. The silence of its steps, if steps
it had, the moaning sounds, too, which it
had uttered, and its strange disappearance,
were circumstances of mysterious import,
that did not apply, with probability, to a
soldier engaged in the duty of his guard.</P>
<P>She now enquired of the sentinel, whe∣ther
he had seen any person besides his fel∣low
watch, walking on the terrace, about
midnight; and then briefly related what
she had herself observed.</P>
<P>“I was not on guard that night, lady,”
replied the man, “but I heard of what
happened. There are amongst us, who
believe strange things. Strange stories,
too, have long been told of this castle, but
it is no business of mine to repeat them;
and, for my part, I have no reason to com∣plain;
our Chief does nobly by us.”</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94"/>
“I commend your prudence,” said
Emily, “Good night, and accept this
from me,” she added, throwing him a small
piece of coin, and then clofing the case∣ment
to put an end to the discourse.</P>
<P>When he was gone, she opened it again,
listened with a gloomy pleasure to the dis∣tant
thunder, that began to murmur among
the mountains, and watched the arrowy
lightnings, which broke over the remoter
scene. The pealing thunder rolled on∣ward,
and then, reverbed by the mountains,
other thunder seemed to answer from the
opposite horizon; while the accumulating
clouds, entirely concealing the moon, as∣sumed
a red sulphureous tinge, that fore∣told
a violent storm.</P>
<P>Emily remained at her casement, till the
vivid lightning, that now, every instant,
revealed the wide horizon and the land∣scape
below, made it no longer safe to do
so, and she went to her couch; but, unable
to compose her mind to sleep, still listened
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
in silent awe to the tremendous sounds,
that seemed to shake the castle to its foun∣dation.</P>
<P>She had continued thus for a considera∣ble
time, when, amidst the uproar of the
storm, she thought she heard a voice, and,
railing herself to listen, saw the chamber
door open, and Annette enter with a coun∣tenance
of wild affright.</P>
<P>“She is dying, ma'amselle, my lady is
dying!” said she</P>
<P>Emily started up, and ran to Madame
Montoni's room. “When she entered, her
aunt appeared to have fainted, for she was
quite still, and insensible; and Emily with
a strength of. mind, that refused to yield to
grief, while any duty required her activity,
applied every means that seemed likely to
restore. her. But the last struggle was
over—she was gone, for ever.</P>
<P>When Emily's perceived, that all her ef∣forts
were inessectual, she interrogated the
terrified Annette, and learned, that Ma∣dame
Montoni had fallen into a doze, soon
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
after Emily's departure, in which she had
continued, until a few minutes before, her
death.</P>
<P>“I wondered, ma'amselle,” said Annette,
“what was the reason my lady did not
seem frightened at the thunder, when I
was so terrified, and I went often to the
bed to speak to her, but she appeared to be
asleep; till presently I heard a strange
noise, and, on going to her, saw she was
dying.”</P>
<P>Emily, at this recital, shed tears. She
had no doubt but that the violent change
in the air, which the tempest produced,
had effected this fatal one, on the exhaust∣ed
frame of Madame Montoni.</P>
<P>After some deliberation, she determined
that Montoni should not be informed of
this event till the morning, for she consi∣dered,
that he might,; perhaps, utter some
inhuman expressions,, such as in the pre∣sent
temper of her spirits she could not
bear. With Annette alone, therefore,
whom she encouraged by her own exam∣ple,
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
she performed some of the last solemn
offices for the dead, and compelled herself
to watch during the night, by the body of
her deceased aunt. During this solemn
period, rendered more awful by the tre∣mendous
storm that shook the air, she fre∣quently
addressed herself to Heaven for
support and protection, and her pious
prayers, we may believe, were accepted of
the God, that giveth comfort.</P>

<P>WHEN Montoni was informed of the
death of his wife, and considered that she
had died without giving him the signature
so necessary to the accomplishment of his
wishes, no sense of decency restrained the
expression of his resentment. Emily anx∣iously
avoided his presence, and watched,
during two days and two nights, with lit∣tle
intermission, by the corpse of her late
aunt. Her mind deeply impressed with
the unhappy fate of this object, she forgot
all her faults, her unjust and imperious con∣duct
to herself; and, remembering only
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
her sufferings, thought of her only with,
tender compaffion. Sometimes, however,
she could not avoid musing upon the strange
infatuation that had proved so fatal to her
aunt, and had involved herself in a laby∣rinth
of misfortune, from which she saw no
means of escaping,—the marriage with
Montoni. But, when she considered this
circumstance, it was “more in sorrow than
in anger,”—more for the purpose of in∣dulging
lamentation, than reproach.</P>
<P>In her pious cares she was not disturbed
by Montoni, who not only- avoided the
chamber, where the remains of his wife
were laid, but that part of the castle ad∣joining
to it, as if he had apprehended a
contagion in death. He seeme. d to have
given no orders respecting the funeral, and
Emily began to fear he meant to offer a
new insult to the memory of Madame
Montoni; but from this apprehension she
was relieved, when, on the evening of the
second day, Annette informed her, that
the interment was to take place that night.
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
She knew, that Montoni would not attend;
and it was so very grievous to her to think
that the remains of her unfortunate aunt
would pass to the grave without one rela∣tive,
or friend to pay them the last decent
rites, that she determined to be deterred by
no consederations for herself, from observ∣ing
this duty. She would otherwise have
shrunk from the circumstance of following
them to the cold vault, to which they were
to be carried by men, whose air and coun∣tenances
seemed to stamp them for mur∣derers,
at the midnight hour of silence and
privacy, which Montoni had chosen for
committing, if ppssible, to oblivion the re∣liques
of a woman, whom his harsh con∣duct
had, at least, contributed to destroy.</P>
<P>Emily, shuddering with emotions of hor∣ror
and grief, assisted by Annette, pre∣pared
the corpse for interment; and, hav∣ing
wrapt it in cerements, and covered it-with
a winding-sheet, they watched beside
it, till past midnight, when they heard
the approaching footsteps. of the men, who
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
were to lay it in its earthy'bed. It was
with difficulty, that Emily, overcame her
emotion, when, the door of the chamber
being thrown open, their gloomy counte∣nances
were seen by the glare of the torch
they carried, and two of them, without
speaking, lifted the body on their shoulders,
while the third preceding them with the
light, descended through the castle towards
the grave, which was in the lower vault
of the chapel within the castle walls.</P>
<P>They had to cross two courts, towards
the east wing of the castle, which, adjoin∣ing
the chapel, was, like it, in ruins: but
the silence and gloom of these courts had
now little power over Emily's mind, oc∣cupied
as it was, with more mournful
ideas; and she scarcely heard the low and
dismal hooting of the night-birds, that
roosted among the ivyed battlements of
the ruin, or perceived the still flittings of
the bat, which frequently crossed her way.
But, when, having entered the chapel,
and passed between the mouldering pillars of
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
the aisles, the bearers stopped at a flight of
steps, that led down to a low arched door,
and, their comrade having descended to un∣lock
it, she saw imperfectly the gloomy
abyss beyond;—faw the corpse of her aunt
carried down these steps, and the ruffian∣like
figure, that stood with a torch at the
bottom to receive it—all her fortitude was
lost in emotions of inexpressible grief and
terror. She turned to lean upon Annette,
who was cold and trembling like herself,
and she lingered so long on the summit of
the slight, that the gleam of the torch be∣gan
to die away on the pillars of the cha∣pel,
and the men were almost beyond her
view. Then, the gloom around her
awakening other fears, and a sense of' what
she considered to be her duty overcoming
her reluctance, she descended to the vaults,
following the echo of footsteps and the
faint ray, that pierced the darkness, till
the harsh grating of a distant door, that
was opened to receive the corpse, again ap∣palled
her.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="103"/>
After the pause of a moment, she went on,
and, as she entered the vaults, saw between
the arches, at some distance, the men lay
down the body near the edge of an open
grave, where stood another of Montoni's
men and a priest, whom she did not ob∣serve,
till he began the burial service then,
lifting her eyes from the ground, she saw
the venerable figure of the friar, and heard
him in a low voice, equally solemn and af∣fecting,
perform the service for the dead.
At the moment, in which they let down
the body into the earth, the scene was such
as only the dark pencil of a Domenichino,
perhaps, could have done justice to.
The fierce features and wild dress of the <HI>con∣dottieri,</HI>
bending with their torches over the
grave, into which the corpse was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scend∣ing,
were contrasted by the venerable figure
of the monk, wrapt in long-black gar∣ments,
his cowl thrown back from his pale
face, on which the light gleaming strongly
shewed the lines of affliction softened by
piety, and. the few grey locks, which time
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
had spared on his temples: while, beside
him, stood the softer form of Emily, who
leaned for support upon Annette; her face
half averted, and shaded by a thin veil,
that fell over her figure; and her mild and
beautiful countenance fixed in grief so so∣lemn
as admitted not of tears, while she
thus saw committed untimely to the earth
her last relative and friend. The gleams,
thrown between the arches of the vaults,
where, here and there, the broken ground
marked the spots in which other bodies
had been recently interred, and the general
obscurity beyond were circumstances, that
alone would have led on the imagination
of a spectator to scenes more horrible, than
even that which was pictured at the grave
of the misguided and unfortunate Madame
Montoni.</P>
<P>When the service was over, the friar re∣garded
Emily with attention and surprise,
and looked as if he wished to speak to her,
but was restrained by the presence of the
condottieri, who, as they now led the way
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
to the courts, amused themselves with jokes
upon his holy order, which he endured in
silence demanding only to be conducted
safely to his convent, and to which Emily
listened with concern and even horror.
When they reached the court, the monk
gave her his blessing, and, after a lingering
look of pity, turned away to the portal,
whither one of the men carried a torch;
while Annette, lighting another, preceded
Emily to her apartment. The appearance
of the friar and the expression of tender
compassion, with which he had regarded
her, had interested Emily, who, though it
was at her earnest supplication, that Mon∣toni
had consented to allow a priest to per∣form
the last rites for his deceased wife,
knew nothing concerning this person, till
Annette now informed her, that, he belong∣ed
to a monastery, situated among the
mountains at a few miles distance. The
Superior, who regarded Montoni and his
associates, not only with aversion, but with
terror, had probably feared to offend him
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
by refusing his request, and had, therefore,
ordered a monk to officiate at the funeral,
who, with the meek spirit of a christian,
had overcome his reluctance to enter the
walls of such a castle, by the wish of per∣forming
what he considered to be his duty,
and, as the chapel was built on conse∣crated
ground, had not objected to commit
to it the remains of the late unhappy Ma∣dame
Montoni.</P>
<P>Several days passed with Emily in total
seclusion, and in a state of mind partaking
both of terror for herself, and grief for the
departed. She, at length, determined to
make other efforts to persuade Montoni to
permit her return to France. Why he
should wish to detain her, she could scarce∣ly
dare to conjecture; but it was too cer∣tain
that he did so, and the absolute refusal
he had formerly given to her departure al∣lowed
her little hope, that he would now
consent to it. But the horror, which his
presence inspired, made her defer, from day
to day, the mention of this subject; and
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
at last she was awakened from her inacti∣vity
only by a message from him, desiring
her attendance at a certain hour. She be∣gan
to hope he meant to resign, now that
her aunt was no more, the authority he had
usurped over her; till she recollected, that
the estates, which had occasioned so much
contention, were now hers, and she then
feared Montoni was about to employ some
stratagem for obtaining them, and that he
would detain her his prisoner, till he suc∣ceeded.
This thought, instead of over∣coming
her with despondency, roused all
the latent powers of her fortitude into ac∣tion;
and the property, which she would
willingly have re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gned to secure the peace
of her aunt, she resolved, that no common
sufferings of her own should ever compel
her to give to Montoni. For Valancourt's
sake also she determined to preserve these
estates, since they would afford that com∣petency,
by which she hoped to secure the
comfort of their future lives. As she
thought of this, she indulged the tendernness
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
of tears, and anticipated the delight of that
moment, when, with affectionate genera∣sity,
she might tell him they were his own.
She saw the smile, that lighted up his fea∣tures
—the affectionate regard, which spoke
at once his joy and thanks; and, at this
instant, she believed she could brave any
suffering, which the evil spirit of Montoni
might be preparing for her. Remembering
then, for the first time since her aunt's
death, the papers relative to the estates in
question, she determined to search for them,
as soon as her interview with Montoni was
over.</P>
<P>With these resolutions she met him at
the appointed time, and waited to hear his
intention before she renewed her request.
With him were Orsino and another of∣ficer,
and both were standing near a table,
covered with papers, which he appeared to
be examining.</P>
<P>“I sent for you, Emily,” said Montoni,
raising his head, “that you might be a
witness in some business, which I am trans∣acting
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
with my friend Orsino. All that
is required of you will be to sign your
name to this paper:” he then took one up,
hurried unintelligibly over some lines, and;
laying it before her on the table, offered
her a pen. She took it, and was going to
write—when the design of Montoni came
upon her mind like a flahm of lightning;
she trembled, let the pen fall, and re∣fused
to sign what she had not read. Mon∣toni
affected to laugh at her scruples, and,
taking up the paper, again pretended to
read;but Emily, who still trembled on
perceiving her danger, and was astonished,
that her own credulity had so nearly be∣trayed
her, positively refused to sign any
paper whatever. Montoni, for some time,
persevered in affecting to ridicule this re∣fusal;
but, when he perceived by her steady
perseverance, that she understood his de∣sign,
he changed his manner, and bade her
follow him to another room. There he
told her, that he had been willing to spare
himself and her the trouble of useless con∣test,
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
in an affair, where his will was justice,
and where she should find it law; and had,
therefore, endeavoured to persuade, rather
than to compel, her to the practice of her
duty.</P>
<P>“I, as the husband of the late Signora
Montoni,” he added, “am the heir of all
she possessed; the estates, therefore, which
she refused to me in her life-time, can no
longer be withheld, and, for your own fake,
I would undeceive you, respecting a foolish
assertion she once made to you in my hear∣ng
—that these estates would be yours, if
she died without resigning them to me.
She knew at that moment, she had no
power to withhold them from me, after
her decease; and I think, you have more
sense, than to provoke my resentment by
advancing an unjust claim. I am not in
the habit of flattering, and you will, there∣fore,
receive, as sincere, the praise I bestow,
when I say, that you possess an under∣standing
superior to that of your sex; and
that you have none of those contemptible
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
foibles, that frequently mark the female
character—such as avarice and the love
of power, which latter makes women de∣light
to contradict and to tease, when they
cannot conquer. If I understand your dis∣position
and your mind, you hold in sove∣reign
contempt these common failings of
your sex.”</P>
<P>Montoni paused; and Emily remained
silent and expecting; for she knew him
too well, to believe he would condescend
to such flattery, unless he thought it would
promote his own interest and, though he
had forborne to name vanity among the
foibles of women, it was evident, that he
considered it to be a predominant one,
since he designed to sacrifice to hers the
character and understanding of her whole
sex.</P>
<P>“Judging as I do,” resumed Montoni,
“I cannot believe you will oppose, where
you know you cannot conquer, or, indeed,
that you would wish to conquer, or be
avaricious of any property, when you have
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
not justice on your side. I think it proper,
however, to acquaint you with the alterna∣tive.
If you have a just opinion of the
subject in question, you shall be allowed a
safe conveyance to France, within a short
period; but, if you are sounhappy as to
be misled by the late assertion of the Sig∣nora,
you shall remain my prisoner, till
you are convinced of your error.”</P>
<P>Emily calmly said,</P>
<P>“I am not so ignorant, Signor, of the
laws on this subject, as to be misled by the
assertion of any person. The law, in the
present instance, gives me the estates in
question, and my own hand shall never
betray my right.”</P>
<P>“I have been mistaken in my opinion
of you, it appears,” rejoined Montoni,
sternly. “You speak boldly, and pre∣sumptuously,
upon a subject, which you do
not understand. For once, I am willing
to pardon the conceit of ignorance; the
weakness of your sex, too, from which,
it seems, you are not exempt, claims some
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
allowance; but, if you persist in this strain
—you have every thing to fear from my
justice.”</P>
<P>“From your justice, Signor,” rejoined
Emily, “I have nothing to fear—I have
only to hope.”</P>
<P>Montoni looked at her with vexation,
and seemed considering what to say.“I
find that you are weak enough,” he resum∣ed,
“to credit the idle assertion I alluded
to! For your own sake I lament this; as
to me, it is of little consequence. Y our
credulity can punish only yourself; and I
must pity the weakness of mind, which
leads you to so much suffering as you are
compelling me to prepare for you.”</P>
<P>“You may find, perhaps, Signor,” said
Emily, with mild dignity, “that the
strength of my mind is equal to the justice
of my cause; and that I can endure with
fortitude, when it is in resistance of op∣pression.”</P>
<P>“You speak like a heroine,” said Mon∣toni,
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
contemptuously; “we shall see
whether you can suffer like one.”</P>
<P>Emily was silent, and. he left the room.</P>
<P>'Recollecting, that it was for Valancourt's
fake she had thus resisted, she now smiled
complacently upon the threatened fufferings, and retired to the spot, which her aunt had
pointed out as the repository of the papers,
relative to the estates, where she found
them as described; and, since she knew of
no better place of concealment, than this,
returned them, without examining their
contents, being fearful of discovery, while
she should attempt a perusal.</P>
<P>To her own solitary chamber she once
more returned, and there thought again
of the late conversation with Montoni, and
of the evil <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> might expect from opposi∣tion
to h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will. But his power did not
appear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> terrible to her imagination, as it
was wont to do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a sacred pride was in her
heart, that taught it to swell against the
pressure of injustice, and almost to glory in
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
the quiet sufferance of ills, in a cause, which
had also the interest of Valancourt for its
object. For the first time, she felt the full
extent of her own superiority to Montoni,
and despised the authority, which, till now,
she had only feared.</P>
<P>As she sat musing, a peal of laughter
rose from the terrace, and, on going to the
casement, she saw, with inexpressible sur∣prise,
three ladies, dressed in the gala habit
of Venice, walking with several gentlemen
below. She gazed in an astonishment
that made her remain at the window, re∣gardless
of being observed, till the group
passed under it; and, one of the strangers
looking up, she perceived the features of
Signora Livona, with whose manners she
had been so much charmed, the day after
her arrival at Venice, and who had been
there introduced at the table of Montoni.
This discovery occasioned her an emotion
of doubtful joy; for it was matter of joy and
comfort to know, that a person, of a mind
so gentle, as that of Signora Livona seem∣ed
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
to be, was near her; yet there was
something so extraordinary in her being at
this castle, circumstanced as it now was,
and evidently, by the gaiety of her air, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
her own consent, that a very painful sur∣mise
arose, concerning her character. But
the thought was so shocking to Emily,
whose affection the fascinating manners of
the Signora had won, and appeared so im∣probable,
when she remembered these
manners, that she dismissed it almost in∣stantly.</P>
<P>On Annette's appearance, however, she
enquired, concerning these strangers; and
the former was as eager to tell, as Emily
was to learn.</P>
<P>“They are just come, ma'amselle,” said
Annette, “with two Signors from Venice,
and I was glad to see such Christian faces
once again.—But what can they mean by
coming here? They must surely be stark
mad to come freely to such a place as this!
Yet they do come freely, for they seem
merry enough, I am sure.”</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117"/>
“They were taken prisoners, perhaps?”
said Emily.</P>
<P>“Taken prisoners!” exclaimed An∣nette;
“no, indeed, ma'amselle, not they▪
I remember one of them very well at Ve∣pice:
she came two or three times, to the
Signor's, you know, ma'amselle, and it was
said, but I did not believe a word of it—it
was saida that the Signor liked her better
than he should do. Then why, says I,
bring her to my lady? Very true, said
Ludovico; but he looked as if he knew
more, too.”</P>
<P>Emily desired Annette would endeavour
to learn who these ladies were, as well as all
she could concerning them; and she then
changed the subject, and spoke of distant
France.</P>
<P>“Ah, ma'amselle! we shall never see it
more!” said Annette, almost weeping.—
“I must come on my travels, forsooth!”</P>
<P>Emily tried to sooth and to cheer her,
with a hope, in which she scarcely herself
indulged.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="118"/>
“How—how, ma'amselle, could you
leave France, and leave Mons. Valancourt,
too?” said Annette, sobbing. “I—I—am
sure, if Ludovico had been in France, I
would never have left it.”</P>
<P>“Why do you lament quitting France,
then?” said Emily, trying to smile, “since,
if you had remained there, you would not
have found Ludovico.”</P>
<P>“Ah, ma'amselle! I only wish I was out
of this frightful castle, serving you in
France, and I would care about nothing
else!”</P>
<P>“Thank you, my good Annette, for
your affectionate regard; the time▪ will
come, I hope, when you may remember
the expression of that wish with pleasure.”</P>
<P>Annette departed on her business, and
Emily sought to lose the sense of her own
cares, in the visionary scenes of the poet;
but she had again to lament the irresistible
force of circumstances over the taste and
powers of the mind; and that it requires
a spirit at ease to be sensible even to the
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
abstract pleasures of pure intellect. The
enthusiasm of genius, with all its pictured
scenes, now appeared cold, and dim.
As she mused upon the book before her,
she involuntarily exclaimed, “Are these,
indeed, the passages, that have so often
given me exquisite delight? Where did the
charm exist?—Was it in my mind, or in
the imagination of the poet? It lived in
each,” said she, pausing. “But the fire of
the poet is vain, if the mind of his reader
is not tempered like his own, however it
may be inferior to his in power.”</P>
<P>Emily would have pursued this train of
thinking, because it relieved her from
more painful reflection, but she found
again, that thought cannot always be con∣trolled
by will; and hers returned to the
consideration of her own situation.</P>
<P>In the evening, not choosing to venture
down to the rarnparts, where she would be
exposed to the rude gaze of Montoni's as∣sociates,
she walked for air in the gallery,
adjoining her chamber; on reaching the
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
further end of which she heard distant
sounds of merriment and laughter. If was
the wild uproar of riot, not the cheering
gaiety of tempered mirth; and seemed to
come from that part of the castle, where
Montonj usually was. Such sounds, at this
time, when her aunt had been so few days
dead, particularly shocked her, consistent
as they were with the late conduct of
Montoni.</P>
<P>As she listened, she thought she distin∣guished
female voices mingling with the
laughter, and this confirmed her worst
surmise, concerning the character of Sig∣nora
Livona and her companions. It was
evident, that they had not been brought
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither by compulsion; and she beheld
herself in the remote wilds of the Apennine,
surrounded by men, whom she considered
to be little less than r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffians, and their
worst associates, amid scenes of vice, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom
which her soul recoiled in horror. It was
at this moment, when the scenes of the pre∣sent
and the future opened to her imagina∣tion,
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
that the image of Valancourt failed in
its influence, and her resolution shook with
dread. She thought she understood all the
horrors, which Montoni was preparing for
her, and shrunk from an encounter with
such remorseless vengeance, as he could in∣flict.
The disputed estates she now almost
determined to yield at once, whenever he
should again call upon her, that she might
regain safety and freedom; but then, the re∣membrance
of Valancourt▪ would steal to
her heart, and plunge her into the distrac∣tions
of doubt.</P>
<P>She continued walking in the gallery,
till evening threw its melancholy twilight
through the painted casements, and deep∣ened
the gloom of the oak wainscoting
around her; while the distant perspective
of the corridor was so much obscured, as
to be discernible only by the glimmering
window, that terminated it.</P>
<P>Along the vaulted halls and passages be∣low,
peals of laughter echoed faintly, at
intervals, to this remote part of the castle,
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
and seemed to render the succeeding still∣ness
more dreary. Emily, however, un∣willing
to return to her more forlorn cham∣ber,
whither Annette was not yet come,
still paced the gallery. As she passed the
door of the apartment, where she had once
dared to lift the veil, which discovered to
her a spectacle so horrible, that she had
never after remembered it, but with emo∣tions
of indescribable awe, this remem∣brance
suddenly recurred. It now brought
with it reflections more terrible, than it had
yet done, which the late conduct of Mon∣toni
occasioned; and, hastening to quit the
gallery, While she had power to do so, she
heard a sudden step behind her.—It might
be that of Annette; but, turning fearfully
to look, she saw, through the gloom, a tall
figure following her, and all the horrors of
that chamber rushed upon her mind. In
the next moment, she found herself clasped
in the arms of some person, and heard a
deep voice murmur in her ear.</P>
<P>When she had power to speak, or to dis∣tinguish
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
articulated sounds, she demanded
who detained her.</P>
<P>“It is I,” replied the voice—“Why are
you thus alarmed?”</P>
<P>She looked on the face of the person
who spoke, but the feeble light, that
gleamed through the high casement at the
end of the gallery, did not permit her to
distinguish the features.</P>
<P>“Whoever you are,” said Emily, in a
trembling voice, “for heaven's sake let
me go!”</P>
<P>“My charming Emily,” said the man,
“why will you shut yourself up in this
obscure place, when there is so much
gaiety below? Return with me to the
cedar parlour, where you will be the fairest
ornament of the party;—you shall not re∣pent
the exchange.”</P>
<P>Emily disdained to reply, and still en∣deavoured
to liberate herself.</P>
<P>“Promise, that you will come,” he
continued, “and I will release you imme∣diately;
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
but first give me a reward for so
doing.”</P>
<P>“Who are you?” demanded▪ Emily, in
a tone of mingled terror and indignation,
while she still struggled for liberty—“who
are you, that have, the cruelty thus to in∣sult
me?”</P>
<P>“Why▪ call me cruel?” said the man,
“I would remove you from this dreary
solitude to a merry party below. Do you
not know me?”</P>
<P>Emily now faintly remembered, that he
was one of the officers who were with Mon∣toni
when she attended him in the morn∣ing.
“I thank you for the kindness of
your intention,” she replied, without ap∣pearing
to understand him, “but I wish
for nothing so much as that you would
leave me.”</P>
<P>“Charming Emily!” said he, “give up
this foolish whim for solitude, and come
with me to the company, and eclipse the
beauties, who make part of it; you, only,
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
are worthy of my love.” He attempted
to kiss; her hand, but the strong impulse of
her indignation gave her power to liberate
herself, and she fled towards the chamber.
She closed the door, before he reached it,
having secured which, she sunk in a chair,
overcome by terror and by the exertion
she had made, while she heard his voice,
and his attempts to open the door, without
having the power to raise herself. At
length, she perceived him depart, and had
remained, listening, for a considerable time,
and was somewhat revived by not hearing
any sound, when suddenly she remembered
the door of the private stair-case, and: that
he might enter that way, since it was fast∣ened
only on the other side. She then em∣ployed
herself in endeavouring to secure
it, in the manner she had formerly done.
It appeared▪ to her, that Montoni had al∣ready
commenced his scheme of vengeance,
by withdrawing from her his protection,
and she repented of the rashness, that had
made her brave the power of such a man.
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
To retain the estates seemed to be now ut∣terly
Impossible, and to preserve her life,
perhaps her honour, she resolved, if she
should escape the horrors of this night, to
give up all claims to the estates, on the
morrow, provided Montoni would suffer
her to depart from Udolpho.</P>
<P>When she had come to this decision,
her mind became more composed, though
she still anxiously listened, and often started
at ideal sounds, that appeared to issue
from the stair-case.</P>
<P>Having sat in darkness for some hours,
during all which time Annette did not ap∣pear,
she began to have serious apprehen∣sions
for her; bu, not daring to venture
down into the castle, was compelled to re∣main
in uncertainty, as to the cause of this
unusual absence.</P>
<P>Emily often stole to the stair-case door,
to listen if any step approached, but still no
sound alarmed her: determining, however,
to watch, during the night, she once more
rested on her dark and desolate couch,
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
and bathed the pillow with innocent tears.
She thought of her deceased parents and
then of the absent Valancourt, and fre∣quently
called upon their names; for the
profound stillness that now reigned, was
propitious to the musing sorrow of her
mind.</P>
<P>“While she thus remained, her ear sud∣denly
caught the notes of distant music, to
which she listened attentively, and, soon
perceiving this to be the instrument she
had formerly heard at midnight, she rose,
and stepped softly to 'the casement, to
which the sounds appeared to come from
a lower room.</P>
<P>In a few moments, their soft melody
was accompanied by a voice so full of
pathos, that it evidently sang not of ima∣ginary
sorrows. Its sweet and peculiar
tones she thought she had somewhere heard
before yet, if this was not fancy, it was,
at most, a very faint recollection. It stole
over her mind, amidst the anguish of
her present suffering, like a celestial strain,
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
soothing, and re-assuring her;—“Plea∣sant
as the gale of spring, that fighs
on the hunter's ear, when he awakens from
dreams of joy, and has heard the music of
the spirits of the hill* ossian.”</P>
<P>But her emotion can scarcely be imagin∣ed,
when she heard sung, with the taste and
simplicity of true feeling, one of the po∣pular
airs of her native province, to which
she had so often listened with delight,
when a child, and which she had so of∣ten
heard her father repeat! To this well∣known
song, never, till now, heard but in
her native country, her heart melted, while
the memory of past times returned. The
pleasant, peaceful scenes of Gascony, the
tenderness and goodness of her parents, the
taste and simplicity of her former life—all
rose to her fancy, and formed a picture,
so sweet and glowing, so strikingly con∣trasted
with the scenes, the characters and
the dangers, which now surrounded her—
that her mind could not bear to pause up∣on
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
the retrospect, and shrunk at the acute∣ness
of its own sufferings.</P>
<P>Her sighs were deep and convulsed; she
could no longer listen to the strain, that
had so often charmed her to tranquillity,
and she withdrew from the casement to a
remote part of the chamber. But she was
not yet beyond the reach of the music;
she heard the measure change, and the
succeeding air called her again to the win∣dow,
for she immediately recollected it to
be the same she had formerly heard in the
fishing-house in Gascony. Assisted, per∣haps;
by the mystery, which had then ac∣companied
this strain, it had made so deep
an impression her memory, that she had
never since entirely forgotten it; and the
manner, in which it was now sung, con∣vinced
her, however unaccountable
the circumstance appeared, that this was the
same voice she had then heard. Surprise
soon yielded to other emotions; a thought
darted, like lightning, upon her mind,
which discovered a train of hopes, that re∣vived
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
all her spirits. Yet these hopes were
so new, so unexpected, so astonishing, that
she did not dare to trust, though she could
not resolve to discourage them. She sat
down by the casement, breathless, and
overcome with the alternate emotions of
hope and fear; then rose again, leaned
from the window, that she might catch a
nearer sound, listened, now doubting and
then believing, softly exclaimed the name
of Valancourt, and then sunk again into
the chair. Yes, it was possible, that Va∣lancourt
was near her, and she recollected
circumstances, which induced her to be∣lieve
it was his voice she had just heard.
She remembered he had more than once
said that the fishing-house, where she had
formerly listened to this voice and air, and
where she had seen pencilled sonnets, ad∣dressed
to herself, had been his favourite
haunt, before he had been made known to
her; there, too, she had herself unexpect∣edly
met him. It appeared, from these
circumstances, more than probable, that he
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
was the musician, who had formerly charm∣ed
her attention, and the author of the
lines, which had expressed such tender ad∣miration;
—who else, indeed, could it be?
She was unable, at that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm a
conjecture, as to the writer, but, since her
acquaintance with Valancourt, whenever
he had mentioned the. fishing-house to
have been known to him, she had not
scrupled to believe that he was the author
of the sonnets.</P>
<P>As these considerations passed over her
mind, joy, fear and tenderness contended
at her heart; she leaned again from the
casement to, catch the sounds, which might
confirm, or destroy her hope, though she
did not recollect to have ever heard him
sing; but the voice, and the. instrument,
now ceased.</P>
<P>She considered for a moment whether she
should venture to speak: then, not choos∣ing,
lest it should▪ be he, to mention his
name, and yet too rnuch interested to ne∣glect
the opportunity of enquiring, she
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
called from the casement, “Is that song
from Gascony?” Her anxious attention
was not cheered by any reply; every thing
remained silent. Her impatience increas∣ing
with her fears, she repeated the ques∣tion;
but still no sound was heard, except
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighings of the wind among the battle∣ments
above; and she endeavoured to con∣sole
herself with a belief, that the stranger,
whoever he, was▪ had retired, before she
had spokcn, beyond the reach of her
voice, which, it appeared certain, had
Valancourt heard and recognized, he
would instantly have replied to. Present∣ly,
however, she considered, hat a-motive
of prudence, and not an accidental remo∣val,
might occasion his silence; but the
surmise, that led to this reflection, sud∣denly
changed her hope and joy to terror
and grief; for, if Valancourt were in the
castle, it was too probable, that he was
here a prisoner, taken with some of his
countrymen, many of whom were at that
time engaged in the wars of Italy, or in∣tercepted
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
in same attempt to reach her.
Had he even recollected Emily's voice,
he would have feared, in these circum∣stances,
to reply to it, in the presence of
the men, who guarded his prison.</P>
<P>What so lately she had eagerly hoped
she now believed she dreaded;—dreaded
to know, that Valancourt was near her;
and, while she was anxious to be relieved
from her apprehension for his safety, she
still was unconscious, that a hope of soon
seeing him, struggled with the fear.</P>
<P>She remained listening at the casement,
till the air began to freshen, and one high
mountain in the east to glimmer with the
morning; when, wearied with anxiety,
she retired to her couch, where she found
it utterly impossible to sleep, for joy, ten∣derness,
doubt and apprehension, distract∣ed
her during the whole night. Now she
rose from the couch, and opened the case∣ment
to listen; then she would pace the
room with impatient steps, and, at length,
return with despondence to her pillow.
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
Never did hours appear to move so hea∣vily,
as those of this anxious night; after;
which she hoped that Annette might ap∣pear,
and conclude her present state of torturing suspense.</P>

<P>IN the morning, Emily was relieved
from her fears for Annette, who came at
an early hour.</P>
<P>“Here were fine doings in the castle,
last night, ma'amselle, said she, as soon as
she entered the room,—fine doings, In∣deed!
Was you not frightened, ma'amselle,
at not seeing rne?”</P>
<P>“I was alarmed both on your account
and on my own,” replied Emily—“What

“Aye, I said so, I told him so; but it
would not do. It was not my fault, in∣deed,

displeasure, “Why do you permit Lu∣dovico
to lock you up?”</P>
<P>“Holy Saints!” exclaimed Annette,
“how can I help it! If he will lock the
door, ma'amselle, and take away the key,
how am I to get out,, unless I jump through
the window? But that I should not mind
so much, if the casements here were not
all so high; one can hardly scramble up
to them on the inside, and one should
break one's neck, I suppose, going down
on the outside. But, you know, I dare say,
ma'am, what a hurly-burly the castle was
in, last night; you must have heard some
of the uproar.”</P>
<P>“What, were they disputing, then?”
said Emily.</P>
<P>“No, ma'amselle, not fighting, but al∣most
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
as good, for I believe there was not
one of the Signors sober; and what is
more, not one of those fine ladies sober,
either. I thought, when I saw them first,
that all those fine silks and fine veils,—
why, ma'amselle, their veils were worked
withsilver! and fine trimmings—boded no
good—I guessed what they were!”</P>
<P>“Good God!” exclaimed Emily,
“what will become of me!”</P>
<P>“Aye, ma'am, Ludovico said much the
same thing of me. Good God! said he
Annette, what is to become of you, if you
are to go running about the castle among
all these drunken, Signors?”</P>
<P>“O! says I, for that matter, I only
want to go to my young lady's chamber,
and I have only to go, you know, along
the vaulted passage and across the great
hall and up the marble slair-cafe and along
the north gallery and through the west
wing of the castle, and I am in the corri∣dor
in a minute.” “Are you so? says
he, and what is to become of you, if
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
you meet any of those noble cavaliers in
the way?” Well, says I, if you think
there is danger, then, go with me, and
guard me; I am never afraid when you
are by.” “What! says he, when I am
scarcely recovered of one wound, shall I
put myself in the way of getting another?
for if any of the cavaliers meet you, they
will fall a▪fighting with me directly. No,
no, says he, I will cut the way shorter,
than through the vaulted pasage and up
the marble stair-case and along the north
gallery and through the west wing of the
castle, for you shall stay here, Annette;
you shall not go out of this room, to-night.”
So, with that I says”—</P>
<P>“Well, well,” said Emily, impatiently,
and anxious to enquire on another subject,
—“so he locked you up?”</P>
<P>“Yes, he did indeed, ma'amselle, not∣withstanding
all I could say to the contrary;
and Catarina and I and he staid there all
night. And in a few minutes after I was
not so vexed, for there came Signer. Ve∣rezzi
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
roaring along the passage, like a
mad bull, and he mistook Ludovico's hall,
for old Carlo's; so he tried to burst open
the door, and called out for more wine,
for that he had drunk all the flasks dry,
and was dying of thirst. So we were all
as still as night, that he might suppose
there was nobody in the room; but the
Signor was as cunning as the best of us,
and kept calling out at the door, “Come
sorth, my antient hero!” said he, “here
is no enemy at the gate, that you need
hide yourself▪ come forth, my valorous
Signor Steward!” Just then old Carlo
opened his door, and he came with a flask
in his hand; for, as soon as the Signor saw
him, he was as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame as could be, and fol∣lowed
him away as naturally as a dog does
a butcher, with, a piece of meat in his bas∣ket.
All this I saw through the key-hole.
Well, Annette, said Ludovico, jeeringly,
shall I let you out now? O no, says I,
I would not”—</P>
<P>“I have some questions to ask you on
another subject,” interrupted Emily, quite
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
wearied by this story. “Do you know
whether there are any prisoners in the castle,
and whether they are confined at this end
of the edifice?”</P>
<P>“I was not in the way, ma'amselle, re∣plied
Annette “when the first party came
in from the mountains, and the last party
is not come back yet, so I don't know,
whether there are any prisoners; but it is
expected back to-night, or to-morrow,
and I shall know then, Perhaps</P>
<P>Emily enquired if she had ever heard
the servants talk of prisoners.</P>
<P>“Ah ma'amselle!” said Annette archly,
“now I dare say you are thinking of
Monsieur Valancourt, and that he may
have come among the armies, which, they
say, are come from our country, to fight
against this state, and that he has met with
some of <HI>cur</HI> people, and is taken captive.
O Lord! how glad I should be, if it was so!”</P>
<P>“Woul'd you, indeed, be glad?” said
Emily, in a tone of mournful reproach.</P>
<P>“To be sure I should, ma'am,” replied
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
Annette,” and would not you be glad too,
to see Signor Valancourt? I don't know
any chevalier I like better, I have a very
great regard for the Signor, truly.”</P>
<P>“Your regard for him cannot be doubt∣ed”
said Emily, “since you wish to see
him a prisoner.”</P>
<P>“Why no, ma'amselle, not a prisoner
either; but one must be glad to see him,
you know. And it was only the other
night I dreamt—I dreamt I saw him drive
into the castle-yard all in a coach and six,
and dressed out, with a laced coat and a
sword, like a lord as he is.”</P>
<P>Emily could not forbear smiling at An∣nette's
ideas of “Valancourt, and repeated
her enquiry, whether she had heard the
servants talk of prisoners.</P>
<P>“No, ma'amselle,” replied she,“never;
and lately they have done nothing but
talk of the apparition, that has been walk∣ing
about of a night on the ramparts, and
that frightened the▪sentinels into fits. It
came among them like a flash of fire, they
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
say, and they all fell down in a row, till
they came to themselves again; and then
it was gone, and nothing to be seen but
the old castle walls; so they helped one
another up again as fast as they could.
You would not believe, ma'amselle, though
I shewed you the very cannon, where it
used to appear.”</P>
<P>“And are you, indeed, so simple, An∣nette,”
said Emily, smiling-at this curious
exaggeration of the circumstance she had
witnessed, “as to credit these stories?”</P>
<P>“Credit them, ma'amselle! why all the
world could not persuade me out of them.
Roberto and Sebastian and half a dozen
more of them went into fits! To be sure,
there was no occasion for that; I said, my∣self,
there was no need of that, for, says
I, when the enemy comes, what a pretty
figure they will cut, if they are to fall
down in fits, all of a row! The enemy won't
be so civil, perhaps, as to walk off, like
the ghost, and leave them to help one
another up, but will fall to, cutting and
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
slashing, till he makes them all rise up
dead men. No, no, says I, there is reason
in all things: though I might have fallen
down in a fit, that was no rule for them,
being, because it is no business of mine
to look gruff and fight battles.”</P>
<P>Emily endeavoured to correct the su∣perstitious
weakness of Annette, though
she could not entirely subdue her own;
to which the latter only replied, “Nay,
ma'amselle, you will believe nothing; you
are almost as bad as the Signor himself,
who was in a great passion when they told
him of what had happened, and swore
that the first man, who repeated such non∣sense,
sould be thrown into the dungeon
under the east turret. This was a hard
punishment too, for only talking non∣sense,
as he called it, but I dare say he
had other reasons for calling it so, than
you have, ma'am”</P>
<P>Emily looked displeased, and made no
reply. As she mused upon the recollected
appearance, which had lately so much
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
alarmed her, and considered the circum∣stances
of the figure having stationed itself
opposite to her casement, she was for a
moment inclined to believe it was Valan∣court,
whom she had seen. Yet, if it was
he, why did▪ he not speak to her, when he
had. the, opportunity of doing so—and, if
he was a prisoner in the castle, and he
could be here in no other character, how
could he obtain the means of walking
abroad on the rampart? Thus she was
utterly unabtle to decide▪ whether the
musician and the form she had observed,
were the same, or, if they were whether
this was Valancourt. She, however, de∣sired,
that Annette would endeavour to
learn whether any prisoners were in the
castle, and also, their names.</P>
<P>“O dear, ma'amselle!” said Annette,
“I forget to tell you what you bade meask
about, the ladies, as they call themselves,
who are lately come to Udolpho. Why
that Signora Livona, that the Signor
brought to see my late lady at Venice, is
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
his mistress now, and was little better
then, I dare say. And Ludovico says
(but pray be secret, ma'am) that his <HI>Ex∣cellenza</HI>
introduced her only to impose
upon the world, that had begun to make
free with her character. So when people
saw my! lady notice her, they thought what
they had heard must be scandal. The
other two are the mistresses of Signor Ve∣rezzi
and Signor Bertolini; and Signor
Montoni invited them all to the castle;
and so, yesterday, he gave a great enter∣tainment;
and there they were, all drinking
Tuscany wine and all sorts, and laughing
and singing, till they made the castle ring
again. But I thought they were dismal
sounds, so soon after my poor lady's death
too; and they, brought to my mind what
she would have thought, if she had heard
them—but she cannot hear them now,
poor soul! said I.”</P>
<P>Emily turned away to conceal her emo∣tion,
and then desired Annette to▪ go, and
make enquiry, concerning the prisoners,
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
that might be in the castle, but conjured
her to do it with caution, and on no ac∣count
to mention her name, or that of
Monsieur Valancourt.</P>
<P>“Now I think of it, ma'amselle,” said
Annette, “I do believe there are prison∣ers,
for I overheard one of the Signor's
men, yesterday, in the servants hall, talk∣ing
something about ransoms,▪ and saying
what a fine thing it was for his <HI>sExcellenza</HI>
to catch up men, and they were as good
booty as any other, because of the ransoms.
And the other man was grumbling, and
saying it was fine enough for the Signor,
but none so fine for his soldiers, because,
said he, we don't go shares there.”</P>
<P>This information heightened▪ Emily's
impatience to know more, and Annette
immediately departed on her enquiry.</P>
<P>The late resolution of Emily to resign
her estates to Montoni, now gave way to
new considerations; the possibility, that
Valancourt was near her, revived her for∣titude
and she determined to brave the
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
threatened vengeance, at least, till she
could be assured whether he was really in
the castle. She was in this temper of
mind, when tse received a message from
Montoni, requiring her attendance in the
cedar parlour, which she obeyed with
trembling, and, on 'her way thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, en∣deavoured
to animate her fortitude with
the idea of Valancourt.</P>
<P>Montoni was alone. “I sent for you,”
said he, “to give you another opportunity
of retracting your late mistaken-assertions
concerning the Languedoc estates. I will
condescend to advise, where I may com∣mand.
—If you are really deluded by an
opinion, that you have any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight to these
estates, at least, do not persist in the error
—an error, which you may perceive, too
late, has been fatal to you. Dare my re∣sentment
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o further, but sign the papers.”</P>
<P>“If I have no right in these estates, sir,”
said Emily, “of what service can it be to
you, that I should sign any papers, con∣cerning
them? If the lands are yours by
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
law, you certainly may possess them, with∣out
my interference, or my consent.”</P>
<P>“I will have no more argument,” said
Montoni, with a look that made her trem∣ble.
“What had I but trouble to expect,
when I condescended to reason with a baby!
But I will be trifled with no longer: let
the▪ recollection of your aunt's sufferings,
in consequence of her folly and obstinacy,
teach you a lesson.—Sign the papers.”</P>
<P>Emily's resolution was for a moment
awed:—she shrunk at the recollections he
revived, and from the vengeance he threat∣ened;
but then, the image of Valancourt,
who so long had loved her, and who was
now,▪ perhaps, so near her, came to her
heart, and, together with the strong feelings
of indignation, with which she had always,
from her infancy, regarded an act of in∣justice,
inspired her with a noble, though
imprudent, courage.</P>
<P>“Sign the papers,” said Montoni,
more impatiently than before.</P>
<P>“Never, sir,” replied Emily; “that re∣quest
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
would have proved to me the in∣justice of your claim,
had I even been ig∣norant
of my right.”</P>
<P>Montoni turned pale with anger,
while his quivering lip and lurking eye
made her almost repent the boldness of her
speech.</P>
<P>“Then all my vengeance falls upon you,”
he exclaimed, with an horrible oath. “And
think not it shall be delayed. Neither the
estates in Languedoc, or Gascony, shall be
yours; you have dared to question my
right,—now dare to question my power.
I have a punishment which you think not
of; it is terrible! This night—this very
night”—</P>
<P>“This night!” repeated another voice.</P>
<P>Montoni paused, and turned half round,
but, seeming to recollect himself, he pro∣ceeded
in a lower tone.</P>
<P>“You have lately seen one terrible ex∣ample
of obstinacy and folly; yet this, it appears,
has not been sufficient to deter
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
you.—I could tell you of others—I could
make you tremble at the bare recital.”</P>
<P>He was interrupted by a groan, which
seemed to rise from underneath the cham∣ber
they were in; and, as he threw a glance
round it, impatience and rage slashed from
his eyes, yet something like a shade of fear
passed over his countenance. Emily sat
down in a chair, near the door, for the va∣rious
emotions she had suffered, now almost
overcame her; but Montoni paused
scarcely an instant, and, commanding his
features, resumed his discourse in a lower,
yet sterner voice.</P>
<P>“I say, I could give you other instances
of my power and of my character, which
it seems you do not understand, or you
would not defy me.—I could tell you,
that, when once my resolution is taken—
but I am talking to a baby. Let me, how∣ever,
repeat, that terrible as are the exam∣ples
I could recite, the recital could not now
benefit you; for, though, your re∣pentance
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
pentance would put an immediate end to
opposition, it would not now appease my
indignation.—I will have vengeance as well
as justice.”</P>
<P>Another groan filled the pause which
Montoni made.</P>
<P>“Leave the room instantly!” said he,
seeming not to notice this strange occur∣rence.
Without power to implore his
pity, she rose to go, but found that she
could not support herself; awe and terror
overcame her, and she sunk again into
the chair.</P>
<P>“Quit my presence!” cried Montoni,
“This affectation of fear ill becomes the
heroine who has just dared to brave my in∣dignation.</P>
<P>“Did you hear nothing, Signor?” said
Emily, trembling, and still unable to leave
the room.</P>
<P>“I heard my own voice,” rejoined
Montoni, sternly.</P>
<P>“And nothing else?” said Emily,
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
speaking with difficulty.—“There again!
Do you hear nothing now?”</P>
<P>“Obey my order,” repeated Montoni.
“And for these fool's tricks—I will soon
discover by whom they are practised.”</P>
<P>Emily again rose, and exerted herself to
the utmost to leave the room, while Mon∣toni
followed her; but, instead of calling
aloud to his servants to search the chamber,
as he had formerly done on a similar oc∣currence,
pasted to the ramparts.</P>
<P>As, in her way to the corridor, she rested
for a moment at an open casement,
Emily saw a party of Montoni's troops
winding down a distant mountain, whom
she noticed no further, than as they brought
to her mind the wretched prisoners they
were, perhaps, bringing to the castle. At
length, having reached her apartment, she
threw herself upon the couch, overcome
with rhe new horrors of her situation. Her
thoughts lost in tumult and perplexity,
she could neither repent of, or approve, her
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
late conduct; she could only remember,
that she was in the power of a man, who
had no principle of action—but his will;
and the astonishment and terrors of super∣stition,
which had, for a moment, so strongly
afsailed her, now yielded to those of
reason.</P>
<P>She was, at length, roused from the re∣verie,
which engaged her, by a confusion of
distant voices, and a clattering of hoofs,
that seemed to come, on the wind, from the
courts. A sudden hope, that some good,
was approaching, seized her mind, till she
remembered the troops she had observed
from, the casement, and concluded this to
be the party, which Annette had said were
expected at Udolpho.</P>
<P>Soon after, she heard voices faintly from
the halls, and the noife of horses' feet sunk
away in the wind; silence ensued. Emily
listened anxiously for Annette's step in the
corridor, but a pause of total stillness conti∣nued,
till again the castle seemed to be all
tumult and confusion. She heard the echoes
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
of many footsteps, passing to and fro in the
halls and avenues below, and then busy
tongues were loud on the rampart. Hav∣ing
hurried to her casement, she perceived
Montoni, with some of his officers, leaning
on the walls, and pointing from them;
while several soldiers were employed at
the further end of the rampart about some
cannon; and she continued to observe
them, careless of the passing time.</P>
<P>Annette at length appeared, but brought
no intelligence of Valancourt, “For, ma'am∣selle,”
said she,“all the people pretend to
know nothing about any prisoners. But
here is a fine piece of business! The rest
of the party are just arrived, ma'am; they
came scampering in as if they would have
broken their necks; one scarcely knew
whether the man, or his horse would get
within the gates first. And they have
brought word—and such news! they have
brought word, that a party of the enemy,
as they call them, are coming towards the
castle; so we shall have all the officers of,
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
justice, I suppose, besieging it! all those
terrible-looking fellows one used to see at
Venice.”</P>
<P>“Thank God! exclaimed Emily, fer∣vently,
“there is yet a hope left for me,
then!”</P>
<P>“What mean you ma'amselle? Do
you wish to fall into the hands of those
sad-looking men! Why I used to shudder
as I passed them, and should have guessed
what they were, if Ludovico had not told
me.”</P>
<P>“We cannot be in worse hands than at
present,” replied Emily, unguardedly;
“but what reason have you to suppose these
are officers of justice?”</P>
<P>Why <HI>our</HI> people, ma'am, are all in
such a fright, and a fuss; and I don't know
any thing but the fear of justice, that could
make them so. I used to think nothing on
earth could fluster them, unless, indeed, it
was a ghost, or so; but now, some of them
are for hiding down in the vaults under the
castle; but you must not tell the Signor
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
this, ma'amselle, and I overheard two of
them talking—Holy Mother! what
makes you look so sad, ma'amselle? You
don't hear what I say!”</P>
<P>“Yes, I do, Annette; pray proceed.”</P>
<P>“Well, ma'amselle, all the castle is in
such hurly-burly. Some of the men are
loading the cannon, and some are examin∣ing
the great gates, and the walls all round,
and are hammering and patching up, just
as if all those repairs had never been made,
that were so long about. But what is to
become of me and you, ma'amselle, and
Ludovico? O! when I hear the sound of
the cannon, I shall die with fright. If I
could but catch the great. gate open for one
minute, I would be even with it for shut∣ting
me within these walls so long!—it
should never see me again.”</P>
<P>Emily caught the latter words of An∣nette.
”O! if you could find it open,
but for one moment!” she exclaimed” my
peace might yet. be saved!” The heavy
groan she uttered, and the wildness of her
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
look, terrified Annette, still more than her
words; who entreated Emily to explain
the meaning of them, to whom it suddenly
occurred, that Ludovico might be of some
service, if there should be a possibility of
escape, and who repeated the substance of
what had passed between Montoni and
herself, but conjured her to mention this
to no person. except to Ludovico.” It
may, perhaps, be in his power,” she added,
”to effect our escape. Go to him, An∣nette,
tell him what I have to apprehend,
and what I have already suffered; but en∣treat
him to be secret, and to lose no time
in attempting to release us. If he is wil∣ling
to undertake this he shall be amply
rewarded. I cannot speak with him my∣self,
for we might be observed and then
effectual care would be taken to prevent
our flight. But be quick, Annette, and,
above all, be discreet—I will await your
return in this apartment.”</P>
<P>The girl, whose honest heart had been
much aflfected by the recital, was now as
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
eager to obey, as Emily was to employ
her, and she immediately quitted the
room.</P>
<P>Emily's surprise increased, as she reflected
upon Annette's intelligence.”Alas!”
said she,” what can the officers of justice
do against an armed castle? these cannot
be such” Upon further consideration,
however, she concluded, that, Montoni's
bands having plundered the country round,
the inhabitants had taken arms, and were
coming with the officers of police and a
party of soldiers, to force their way into
the castle.” But they know not,” thought
she,” its strength, or the armed numbers
within it. Alas! except from flight, I
have nothing to hope!”</P>
<P>Montoni, though not precisely what
Emily apprehended him to be—a captain
of banditti—had employed his troops in
enterprises not less daring, or less atrocious,
than such a character would have under∣taken.
They had not only pillaged, when∣ever
opportunity offered, the helpless
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
traveller, but had attacked, and plundered
the villas of several persons, which, being
situated among the solitary recesses of the
mountains, were totally unprepared for re-sistance.
In these expeditions the com∣manders
of the party did not appear, and
the men, partly disguised, had sometimes
been mistaken for common robbers, and,
at others, for bands of the foreign enemy,
who, at that period, invaded the country.
But, though they had already pillaged seve∣ral
mansions, and brought home consider∣able
treasures, they had ventured to ap∣proach
only one castle, in the attack of
which they were assisted by other troops of
their own order; from this however, they
were vigorously repulsed, and pursued by
some of the foreign enemy, who were in
league with the besieged. Montoni's troops
fled precipitately towards Udolpho, but were
so closely tracked aver the mountains, that,
when they reached one of the heights: in
the neighbourhood of. the castle, and
looked back upon the road, they perceived
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
the enemy winding among the cliffs be∣low,
and at not more than a league distant.
Upon this discovery, they hastened forward
with increased speed, to prepare Montoni
for the enemy; and it was their arrival,
which had thrown the castle into such con∣fusion
and tumult.</P>
<P>As Emily awaited anxiously some in∣formation
from below, she now saw from her
casements a body of troops pour over the
neighbouring heights; and, though. An∣nette
had been gone a very short time, and
had a difficult and dangerous business to
accomplish, her impatience for intelligence
became painful: she listened; opened
her door; and often went out upon the
corridor to meet her.</P>
<P>At length, she heard a footstep approach
her chamber; and, on opening the door,
saw, not Annette but old Carlo! New
fears rusheod upon her mind. He said he
came from the Signor, who had ordered
him to inform her, that me must be ready
to depart from Udolpho immediately, for
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
that the castle was about to be besieged;
and that mules were preparing to convey
her, with her guides, to a place of safety.</P>
<P>”Of safety!” exclaimed Emily, thought∣lessly;
has, then, the Signor so much
consideration for me?”</P>
<P>Carlo looked upon the ground, and
made no reply. A thousand opposite emo∣tions
agitated Emily, successively, as she
listened to old Carlo; those of joy, grief,
distrust and apprehension, appeared, and
vanished from her mind, with the quick∣ness
of lightning. One moment, it seemed
impossible, that Montoni could take this
measure merely for her preservation; and
so very strange was his sending her from
the castle at all, that she could attribute
it only to the design of carrying into exe∣cution
the new scherne of vengeance, with
which he had menaced her. In the next
instant, it appeared so desirable to quit the
castle, under any circumstances, that she
could not but rejoice in the prospect, be∣lieving
that change must be for the better,
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
till she remembered the probability of Va∣lancourt
being detained in it, when sorrow
and regret usurped hermind, and she wish∣ed,
much more fervently than she had yet
done, that it might not be his voice which
she had heard.</P>
<P>Carlo having reminded her, that she had
no time to lose, for that the enemy were
within sight of the castle, Emily entreated
him to inform her whither she was to go; and,
after some hesitation, he said he had re∣ceived
no orders to tell; but, on her repeat∣ing
the question, replied, that he believed
she was to be carried into Tuscany.</P>
<P>”To Tuscany!” exclaimed Emily—
”and why thither?”</P>
<P>Carlo answered, that he knew nothing
further, than that she was to be lodged in
a cottage on the. borders of Tuscany, at
the feet of the Apennines—”Not a day's
journey distant,”' said he.</P>
<P>Emily now dismissed him; add, with
trembling hands, prepared the small pack∣age,
that she meant to take with her; while
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
she was employed about which Annette
returned.</P>
<P>”O ma'amselle!”said she,” nothing can
be done! Ludovico says the new porter
is more watchful even than Barnardine
was, and we might as well throw ourselves
in the way of a dragon, as in his. Ludo∣vico
is almost as broken-hearted as you
are, ma'am, on my account, he says, and
I am sure I shall never live to hear the
cannon fire twice!”</P>
<P>She now began to weep, but revived,
upon hearing of what had just occurred,
and entreated Emily to take her with her</P>
<P>”That I will do most willingly,” replied
Emily,” if Signor Montoni permits it;”
to which Annette made no reply, but ran
out of the room, and immediately sought
Montoni, who was on the terrace, surrounded
by his officers, where she began her peti∣tion.
He sharply bade her go into the
castle, and absolutely refused her request.
Annette, However, not only pleaded for
herself, but;for Ludovico; and Montoni
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
had ordered some of his men to take her
from his presence, before she would retire.</P>
<P>In an agony of disappointment,she re∣turned
to Emily, who foreboded little good
towards herself, from this refusal to An∣nette,
and who, soon after, received a sum∣mons
to repair to the great court, where
the mules, with her guides, were in wait∣ing.
Emily here tried in vain to sooth
the weeping Annette, who persisted in
saying, that shc should never see her dear
young lady again; a fear, which. her mis∣tress
secretly thought too well justified, but
which she endeavoured to restrain, while,
with apparent composure, she bade this
affectionate servant farewell. Annette,
however, followed to the courts, which
were now thronged with people, busy in
preparation for the enemy; and, having
seen her mount her mule and depart, with
her attendants, through the portal, turned
into the castle and wept again.</P>
<P>Emily, meanwhile, as she looked back
upon the gloomy courts of the castle, no
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
longer silent as when she had first entered
them, but resounding with the noise of
preparation for their defence, as well as
crowded with soldiers and workmen, hur∣rying
to and fro; and, when she passed
once more under the huge portcullis,
which had formerly struck her with terror
and dismay; and, looking round, saw no
walls to confine her steps—felt, in spite of
anticipation, the sudden joy of a prisoner,
who unexpectedly finds himself at liberty.
This emotion would not suffer. her now to
look impartially on the dangers that await∣ed
her without; on mountains infested by
hostile parties, who seized every opportu∣nity
for plunder; and on a journey com∣menced
under the guidance of men, whose
countenances certainly did not speak fa∣vourably
of their dispositions. In the pre∣sent
moments, she could only rejoice, that
she was liberated from those walls, which,
she had entered with such dismal forebod∣ings;
and, remembering the superstitious
presentiment, which had then seized her,
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
she could now smile at the impression it
had made upon her mind.</P>
<P>As she gazed, with these emotions, up∣on
the turrets of the castle, rising high over
the woods, among which she wound, the
stranger, whom she believed to be con∣fined
there, returned to her remembrance,
and anxiety and apprehension, left he
should be Valancourt, again passed like a
cloud upon her joy. She recollected eve∣ry
circumstance, concerning this unknown
person, since the night, when she had first
heard him play the song of her native pro∣vince;
—circumstances, which she, had so
often recollected, and compared before,
without extracting from them any thing
like conviction, and which still only
prompted her to believe, that Valancourt
was a prisoner at Udolpho. It was possi∣ble,
however, that the men, who were
her conductors, might afford her infor∣mation,
on this subject; but, fearing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to
question them immediately, left they should
be unwilling to discover any circumstance
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
to her in the presence of each other, she
watched for an opportunity of speaking
with them separately.</P>
<P>Soon after, a trumpet echoed faintly
from a distance; the guides stopped, and
looked toward the quarter whence it came,
but the thick woods, which surrounded
them, excluding all view of the country
beyond, one of the men rode on to the
point of an eminence, that afforded a
more extensive prospect, to observe how
near the enemy, whose trumpet he guessed
this to be, were advanced; the other,
meanwhile, remained with Emily, and to
him she put some questions, concerning
the stranger at Udolpho. Ugo, for this
was his name, said, that there were seve∣ral
prisoners in the castle, but he neither
recollected their persons, or the precise
time of their arrival, and could therefore
give her no information. There was a
surliness in his manner, as he spoke, that
made it probable he would not have satis∣fied
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
her enquiries, even if he could have
done so.</P>
<P>Having asked him what prisoners had
been taken, about the time, as nearly as
she could remember, when she had first
heard the music,” All that week,” said
Ugo,” I was out with a party, upon the
mountains, and knew nothing of what was
doing at the castle. We had enough up∣on
our hands, we had warm work of it.”</P>
<P>Bertrand, the other man, being now
returned, Emily enquired no further, and,
when he had related to his companion
what he had seen, they travelled on in
deep silence; while Emily often caught, be∣tween
the opening woods, partial glimpses
of the castle above—the west towers, whose
battlements were now crowded with archers'
and the ramparts below, where soldiers
were seen hurrying along, or busy upon
the walls, preparing the cannon.</P>
<P>Having emerged from the woods, they
wound along the valley in an opposite di∣rection
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
to that, from whence the enemy
were approaching. Emily had now a full
view of Udolpho, with its gray walls,
towers and terraces, high over-topping the
precipices and the dark woods, and glitter∣ing
partially with the arms of the <HI>condot∣tieri,</HI>
as the sun's rays, streaming through
an autumnal cloud, glanced upon a part
of the edifice, whose remaining features
stood in darkened majesty. She continued
to gaze, through her tears, upon walls
that, perhaps, consined Valancourt, and
which now, as the cloud floated away,
were lighted up with sudden splendour,
and then, as suddenly were shrouded in
gloom; while the passing gleam fell on
the wood-tops below, and heightened the
first tints of autumn, that had begun to
steal upon the foliage. The winding
mountains, at length, shut Udolpho from
her view, and she turned, with mournful
reluctance, to other objects. The melan∣choly
sighing of the wind among the pines,
that waved high over the steeps, and the
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
distant thunder of a torrent assisted her
musings, and conspired with the wild
scenery around, to diffuse over her mind
emotions solemn, yet not unpleasing, but
which were soon interrupted by the distant
roar of cannon, echoing among the moun∣tains.
The sounds rolled along the wind,
and were repeated in saint and fainter re∣verberation,
till they sunk in sullen mur∣murs.
This was a signal, that the enemy
had reached the castle, and fear for Valan∣court
again tormented Emily. She turned
her anxious eyes towards that part of the
country, where the edifice stood, but the
intervening heights concealed it from her
view; still, however, she saw the tall
head of a mountain, which immediately
fronted her late chamber, and on this she
fixed her gaze, as if it could have told her
of all that was passing in the scene it over∣looked.
the guides twice reminded, her,
that she was losing time and that they had
far to go, before she could turn from this
interesting object, and, even when she
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
again moved onward, she often sent a look
back, till only its blue point, brightening
in a gleam of sunshine, appeared peeping
over other mountains.</P>
<P>The sound of the cannon affected Ugo,
as the blast of the trumpet does the war∣hore;
it called forth all the fire of his na∣ture;
he was impatient to be in the midst
of the fight, and uttered frequent execra∣tions
against Montoni for having sent him
to a distance. The feelings of his com∣rade
seemed to be very opposite, and
adapted rather to the cruelties, than to the
dangers of war.</P>
<P>Emily asked frequent questions, con∣cerning
the place of her destination, but
could only learn, that she was going to a
cottage in Tuscany; and, whenever she
mentioned the subject, she fancied she
perceived, in the countenances of these
men, an expression of malice and cunning,
that alarmed her.</P>
<P>It was afternoon, when they had left the
castle. During several hours, they travel∣led
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
through regions of profound solitude,
where no bleat of sheep, or tark of watch∣dog,
broke on silence, and they were now
too far off to heat even the faint thunder
of the cannon. Towards evening, they
wound down precipices, black with forests
of cypress, pine and cedar, into a glen fo
savage and secluded, that, if Solitude ever
had local habitation, this might have been
“her place of dearest residence.” To
Emily it appeared a spot exactly suited
for the retreat of banditti, and, in her ima∣gination,
she already saw them lurking un∣der
the brow of some projecting rock
whence their shadows, lengthened by the
setting sun, stretched across the road, and
warned the traveller of his danger. She
shuddered at the idea, and, looking at
her conductors, to observe whether they
were armed, thought she saw in them the
banditti she dreaded!</P>
<P>It was in this glen, that they proposed
to alight, “For,” said Ugo,” night will
come on presently, and then the wolves
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
Will make it dangerous to stop. This
was a new subject of alarm to Emily, but
inferior to what she suffered from the
thought of being left in these wilds, at
midnight, with two such men as her pre∣sent
conductors, Dark and dreadful hints
of what might be Montoni's purpose in
sending her hither, came to her mind.
She endeavoured to dissuade the menfrom
stopping, and enquired, with anxiety, how
far they had yet to go.</P>
<P>“Many leagues yet,” replied Bertrand.
“As for you, Signora, you may do as
you please about eating, but for us, we
will make a hearty supper, while we can.
We shall have need of it, I warrant, be∣fore
we finish our journey. The sun's go∣ing
down apace; let us alight under that
rock, yonder.”</P>
<P>His comrade affented, and, turning the
mules out of the road, they advanced to∣wards
a cliff, overhung with cedars Emi∣ly
following in trembling silence. They
lifted her from her mule, and, having
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
seated themselves on the grass, at the foot
of the rocks, drew some homely fare from
a wallet, of which Emily tried to eat a lit∣tle,
the better to disguise her apprehen∣sions.</P>
<P>The fun was now sunk behind the high
mountains in the west, upon which a pur∣ple
haze began to spread, and the gloom
of twilight to draw over the surrounding
objects. To the low and sullen murmur of
the breeze, passing among the woods, she
no longer listened with any degree of plea∣sure,
for it conspired with the wildness of
the scene and the evening hour, to depress
her spirits.</P>
<P>Suspense had so much increased her
anxiety, as to the prisoner at Udolpho,
that, finding it impracticable to speak
alone with Bertrand, on that subject, she
renewed, her questions in the presence of
Ugo; but he either was, or pretended to
be entirely ignorant, concerning the stran∣ger.
When he had dismssed the question,
he talked with Ugo on some subject, which
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
led to the mention of Signor Orsino and
of the affair that had banished him from
Venice; respecsting which Emily had ven∣tured
to ask. a few questions. Ugo ap∣peared
to be well acquainted, with the
circumstances of that tragical event, and
related some minute particulars, that both
shocked and surprised her, for it appeared
very extraordinary how such particulars
could be known to any, but to persons,
present when the affassination was com∣mitted.</P>
<P>”He was of rank,” said Bertrand,” or
the State would not have troubled itself to
enquire after his affassins. The Signor has
been lucky hitherto; this is not the first
affair of the kind he has had upon his
hands; and to be sure, when a gentleman
has no other way of getting redress—why
he must take this.”</P>
<P>”Aye,” said Ugo,” and why is not
this as good as another? This is the way
to have justice done at once, without more
ado. If you go to law, your must stay till
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
the judges please, and may lose your cause,
at last. Why the best way, then, is to
make sure of your right, while you can,
and execute justice yourself.”</P>
<P>”Yes, yes,” rejoined Bertrand,” if you
wait till justice is done you—you may stay
long enough. Why if I want a friend of
mine properly served, how am I to get
my revenge? Ten to one they will tell me
he is in the right, and I am in the wrong.
Or, if a fellow has got possession of proper∣ty,
which I think ought to be mine, why I
may wait, till I starve, perhaps, before
the law will give it me, and then, after
all, the judge may say—the estate is his.
What is to be done then?—Why the case
is plain enough, I must take it at last.”</P>
<P>Emily's horror at this conversation was
heightened by a suspicion, that the latter
part of it was pointed against herself, and
that these men had been commissioned by
Montoni to execute a similar kind of <HI>jus∣tice,</HI>
in his cause.</P>
<P>”But I was speaking of Signor Orsino,”
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
resumed Bertrand,” he is one of those, who
love to do justice at once. I remember,
about ten years ago, the Signor had a
quarrel with a cavaliero of Milan. The
story was told me then, and it is still fresh
in my head. They quarrelled about a
lady, that the Signor liked, and she was
perverse enough to preser the gentleman,
of Milan, and even carried her whimso
far as to marry him. This provoked the
Signor, as well it might, for he had tried
to talk reason to her a long while, and used
to send people to serenade her, under her
windows, of a night; and used to make
verses about hex and, would swear she was
the handsomest lady in Milan—But all
would not do—nothing would bring her
to reason; and, as I said, she went so far
at last, as to marry this other cavaliero.
This made the Signsr wrath, with a ven∣geance;
he resolved to be even with her
though, and he watched his opportunity,
and did not wait long, for, soon after the
marriage, they set out for Padua, nothing
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
doubting, I warrant, of what was prepar∣ing
for them. The cavaliero thought, to
be sure, he was to be called to no account,
but was to go off triumphant; but he was
soon made to know another sort of story.”</P>
<P>”What then, the lady had promised to
have Signor Orsino.” said Ugo.</P>
<P>”Promised! No,” replied Bertrand,
”she had not wit enough even to tell him
she liked him, as I heard, but the contra∣ry,
for she used to say, from the first, she
never meant to have him. And this was
what provoked the Signor, so, and with
good reason, for, who likes to be told that
he is disagreeable? and this was saying as
good. It was enough to tell him this; she
need not have gone, and married another.”</P>
<P>”What, she married, then, on pur∣pose
to plague the Signor? said Ugo.</P>
<P>”I don't know as for that,” replied Ber∣trand,
”they said, indeed, that she had had
a regard for the other gentleman a great
while; but that is nothing to the purpose,
she should not have married him, and then
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
the Signor would not have been so much
provoked. She might have expected what
was to follow; it was not to be supposed
he would bear her ill usage tamely, and
she might thank herself for what happened.
But, as I said, they set out for Padua, she
and her husband, and the road lay over
some barren mountains like these. This
suited the Signo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s purpose well. He
watched the time of their departure, and
sent his men after them, with directions
what to do. They kept their distance, till
they saw their opportunity, and this did
not happen, till the second day's journey,
when, the gentleman having sent his ser∣vants
forward to the next town, may be,
to have horses in readiness, the Signor's
men quickened their pace, and overtook
the carriage, in a hollow, between two
mountains, where the woods prevented the
servants from seeing what passed, though
they were then not far off. When we
came up, we fired our trombomi, but
missed</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180"/>
Emily turned pale, at these words, and
then hoped she had mistaken them; while
Bertrand proceeded:</P>
<P>”The gentleman fired again, but he
was soon made to alight, and it was as he
turned to call his people, that he was
struck. It was the most dexterous feat you
ever saw—he was struck in the back with
three stillettos at once. He fell, and was
dispatched in a minute; but the lady es∣caped,
for the servants had heard the firing,
and came up before she could be taken
care of. 'Bertrand' said the Signor, when
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is men returned”—</P>
<P>”Bertrand!” exclaimed Emily, pale
with horror, on whom not a syllable of this
narrative had been lost.</P>
<P>”Bertrand, did I say?” rejoined the man,
with some confusion—” No, Giovanni
But I have forgot where I was;—Ber∣trand
”said the Signor.”—</P>
<P>”Bertrand, again!” said Emily, in a
faltering voice,” Why do you repeat
that name?”</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181"/>
Bertrand swore.” What signifies it,” he
proceeded,” what the man was called—
Bertrand, or Giovanni—or Roberto? it's
all one for that. You have put me out
twice with that—question. 'Bertrand,
or Giovanni—or what you will 'Ber∣trand,
said the Signor, 'if your comrades
had done their duty, as well as you, I
should not have lost the lady. Go, my
honest fellow, and the happy with this.'
He gave him a purse of gold—and little
enough too, considering the service he had
done him.”</P>
<P>”Aye, aye,” said Ugo, ”little enough
—little enough.”</P>
<P>Emily now breathed with difficulty, and
could scarcely support herself. When first she
saw these men, their appearance and their
connection with. Montoni had been suffi∣cient
to- impress her with distrust but
now, when one of them had betrayed
himself to be a murderer, and she saw her∣self,
at the approach of night, under his
guidance, among wild and solitary moun∣tains,
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
and going she scarcely knew whither,
the most agonizing terror seized her, which
was the less supportable from the necessity
she found herself under of concealing all
symptoms of it from her companions.
Reflecting on the character and the me∣naces
of Montoni, it appeared not impro∣bable,
that he had delivered her to them,
for the purpose of having her murdered,
and of thus securing to himself, without
further opposition, or delay, the estates,
for which he had so long and so. desperately
contended. Yet, if this was his design,
there appeared no necessity for sending
her to such a distance from the castle; for,
if any dread of discovery had made him
unwilling to perpetrate the deed there, a
much nearer place might have sufficed
for the purpose of concealment. These
considerations, however, did not imme∣diately
occur to Emily, with whom so
many circumstances conspired. to rouse
terror, that she had no power to oppose it,
or to enquire coolly into its grounds; and,
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
if she had done so, still there were many
appearances which: would too well have
justified her most terrible apprehensions.
She did not now dare to speak to her con∣ductors,
at the sound of whose voices she
trembled; and when, now and then, she
stole a glance at them their countenances,
seen imperfectly through the gloom of
evening, served to confirm her fears.</P>
<P>The fun had now been set some time;
heavy clouds, whose lower skirts were
tinged with sulphureous crimson, lingered
in the west, and threw a reddish tint upon
the pine forests,. which sent forth a solemn
sound, as the breeze rolled over them.
The hollow moan struck upon Emily's
heart, and served to render more gloomy
and terrific every object around her,—
the mountains, shaded in twilight—the
gleaming torrent, hoarsely roaring—the
black forests, and the deep glen, broken
into rocky recesses, high overshadowed by
cypress and sycamore and winding into
long obscurityv To this glen, Emily, as
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
she sent forth her anxious eye, thought
there was no end; no hamlet, or even
cottage, was seen, and still no distant bark
of watch-dog, or even faint, far-off halloo
came on the wind. In a tremulous, voice,
she now ventured to remind the guides, that
it was growing late, and to ask, again how
far they had to go: but they were too
much occupied by their own discourse to
attend to her question, which she forbore
to repeat, left it should provoke a surly
answer. Having, however, soon after, fi∣nished
their supper, the men, collected the
fragments into their wallet, and proceed∣ed
along, this winding glen, in gloomy
silence; while Emily again mused upon
her own situation, and concerning the mo∣tives
of Montoni for involving her in it.
That it was for some evil purpose towards
herself, she could not doubt; and it seemed,
that, if he did not intend to destroy her,
with a view of immediately seizing her
estates, he meant to reserve her a-while
in concealment, for some more terrible de∣sign,
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
for one that might equally gratify his
avarice and still more his deep revenfe.
At this moment, remembering Signor
Brochio and his behaviour in the corridor,
a few preceding nights, the latter suppo∣sition
horrible as it was, strengthened in her belief.
Yet, why romove her from the
castle, where deeds of darkness had, she
feared, been often executed with secrecy?
—from chambers, perhaps
<Q>With many a foul, and midnight murder stain'd”</Q></P>
<P>The dread of what she might be going
to encounter was now so excessive, that it
sometimes threatened her senses; and,
often as she-went she thought of her late
father and, of al1 he would have suffered,
could he have foreseen the strange and
dreadful events of her future life; and
how anxiously he would have avoided that
fatal confidence, which committed his
daughter to the care of a woman so weak
as was Madame Montoni. So romantic
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
and improbable, indeed, did her present
situation appear to Emily herself, particu∣larly
when she compared it with the repose
and beauty of her early days, that there
were moments, when she could almost have
believed herself the victim of frightful
visions, glaring upon a disordered fancy.</P>
<P>Restrained by the presence of her guides
from expressing her terrors, their acuteness
was, at length, lost in gloomy despair.
The dreadful view of what might await
her hereafter rendered her almost indiffer∣ent
to the surrounding dangers. She now
looked, with little emotion, on the wild
dingles, and the gloomy road and moun∣tains,
whofe outlines only were distinguish∣able
through the dusk;—objects, which but
lately had affected her spirits so much, as
to awaken horrid views of the future, and
to tinge these with their own gloom</P>
<P>It was now so nearly dark, that the tra∣vellers,
who proceeded only by the slowest
pace, could, scarcely discern their way.
The clouds, which seemed charged with
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
thunder, passed slowly along the heavens,
shevving, at intervals, the trembling stars;
while the groves of cypress and sycamore,
that overhung the rocks, waved high in
the breeze, as it swept over the glen, and
then rushed among the distant woods.
Emily shivered as it passed.</P>
<P>”Where is the torch?” said Ugo, ”It
grows dark.”</P>
<P>”Not so dark yet,” replied Bertrand,
”but we may find our way, and 'tis best
not light the torch, before we can help,
for it may betray us, if any struggling
party of the enemy is abroad”</P>
<P>Ugo muttered something, which Emily
did not understand, and they proceeded
in darkness, while she almost wished, that
the enemy might discover them; for
from change there was something to hope,
since she could scarcely imagine any situ∣ation
more dreadful than her present one.</P>
<P>As they moved slowly along, her atten∣tion
was surprised by a thin tapering flame,
that appeared, by fits at the point of the
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
pike, which Bertrand carried, resembling
what she had observed on the lance of the
sentinel, the night Madame Montoni died,
and which he had said was an omen. The
event immediately following it appeared to
justify the assertion, and a superstitious
impression had remained on Emily's mind,
which the present appearance confirmed.
She thought it was an omen of her own
fate, and watched it successively vanish
and return, in gloomy silence, which was
at length, interrupted by Bertrand.</P>
<P>”Let us light the torch” said he, ”and
get under shelter of the woods;—a storm
is coming on—look at my lance.”</P>

<P>”Aye,” said Ugo, ”you are not one of
those, that believe in omens: we have
left cowards at the castle, who would turn
pale at such a-sight. I have often seen it
before a thunder storm, it is an omen of
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
that, and one is coming now, sure enoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
The clouds flash fast already.”</P>
<P>Emily was relieved by this conversation
from some of the terrors of superstition,
but those of reason increased, as, waiting
while Ugo searched for a flint, to strike
fire, she watched the pale lightning glearn
over the woods they were about to enter,
and illumine the harsh countenances of
her companions. Ugo could not find a
flint, and Bertrand became impatient, for
the thunder sounded hollowly at a distance,
and the lightning was more frequent
Sometimes, it revealed the nearer recesses
of the woods, or, displaying some opening
in their summits, illumined the ground be∣neath
with partial splendour, the thick fo∣liage
of the trees preserving the surround∣ing
scene in deep shadow.</P>
<P>At length, Ugo found a flint, and the
torch was lighted. The men then dis∣mounted,
and having assisted Emily, led
the mules towards the woods, that skirted
the glen, on the left, over broken ground,
frequently interrupted with brush-wood
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
and wild plants, which she was often obliged
to make a circuit to avoid.</P>
<P>She could not approach these woods
without experiencing keener sense of her
danger. Their deep silence, except when
the wind swept among their branches, and
impenetrable glooms shewn partially by
the sudden flash, and then, by the red
glare of the torch, which served only to
make ”darkness visible,” were circum∣stances,
that contributed to renew all her
most terrible apprehensions; she thought,
too, that, at this moment, the countenances
of her conductors displayed more than
their usual fierceness, mingled with a kind
of lurking exultation, which they seemed
endeavouring to disguise. To her af∣frighted
fancy it occurred, that they were
leading her into these woods to complete
the will of Montoni by her murder. The
horrid suggestion called a groan from her
heart, which surprised her companions,
who turned round quickly towards her,
and she demanded why they led her thither,
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
beseeching them to continue their way
along the open glen, which she represented
to be less dangerous than the woods, in a
thunder storm.</P>
<P>”No, no,” said Bertrand, ”we know
best where the danger lies. See how the
clouds open over our heads. Besides, we
can glide under cover of the woods with
less hazard of being seen, should any of
the enemy be wandering this way. By
holy St. Peter and all the rest of them,
I've as stout a heart as the best, as many a
poor devil could tell, if he were alive
again—but what can we do against num∣bers?</P>
<P>”What are you whining about?” said
Ugo, contempruously,“who fears num∣bers!
Let them come, though they were as
many, as the Signor's castle could hold; I
would shew the knaves what fighting is.
For you—I would lay you quietly in a
dry ditch, where you might peep out, and
see me put the rogues to flight.—Who
talks of fear!”</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192"/>
Bertrand replied, with an horrible oaih
that he did not<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch jesting, and a
violent altercation enfued, which was, at
length, silenced by the thunder, whose deep
volley was heard afar, rolling onward till
it burst over their heads in sounds, that
seemed to shake the earth to its centre.
The russians paused, and looked upon each
other. Between the boles of the trees, the
blue lightning flashed and quivered along
the ground, while, as Emily looked under
the boughs, the mountains beyond fre∣quently
appeared to be clothed in livid
flame. At this moment perhaps, she felt
less fear of the storm, than did either of her
companions, for other terrors occupied her
mind.</P>
<P>The men now rested under an enor∣mous
chesnut-tree, and fixed their pikes in
the ground, at some distance, on the iron
points of which Emily repeatedly observed
the lightning play, and then glide down
them into the earth.</P>
<P>”I would we were well in the Signor's
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
castle!” said Bertrand, ”I know not why he
should send us on this business. Hark!
how it rattles, above, there! I could almost
find in my heart to turn priest, and pray.
Ugo, hast got a rosary?”</P>
<P>”No,” replied Ugo, ”I leave it to cow∣ards
like thee, to carry rosaries—I, carry a
sword.”</P>
<P>”And much good may it do thee in
fighting against the storm!” said Bertrand.</P>
<P>Another peal, which was reverberated in
tremendous echoes among the mountains,
silenced them for a moment. As it rolled
away, Ugo proposed going on. ”We are
only losing time here,” said he, ”for the
thick boughs of the woods will shelter us as
well as this chesnut-tree.”</P>
<P>They again led the mules forward, be∣tween
the boles of the trees, and over path∣less
grass, that concealed their high knotted
roots. The rising wind was now heard
contending with the thunder, as it rushed
suriously among the branches above, and
brightened the red flame of the torch
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
which threw a stronger light forward among
the woods, and shewed their gloomy re∣cesses
to be suitable resorts for the wolves,
of which Ugo had formerly spoken.</P>
<P>At length, the strength of the wind
seemed to drive the storm before it, for the
thunder rolled away into distance, and was
only faintly heard. After travelling through
the woods for nearly an hour, during
which the elements seemed to have returned
to repose, the travellers, gradually ascend∣ing
from the glen, sound themselves upon
the open brow of a mountain, with a wide
valley, extending in misty moon-light, at
their feet, and above, the blue sky, trem∣bling
through the few thin clouds, that
lingered after the storm, and were sinking
slowly to the verge of the horizon.</P>
<P>Emily's spirits, now that she had quitted
the woods, began to revive; for she con∣sidered,
that, if these men had received an
order to destroy her, they would probably
have executed their barbarous purpose in
the solitary wild, from whence they had just
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
emerged, where the deed would have been
shrouded from every human eye. Reassured
by this, reflction, and by the quiet de∣meanour
of her guides, Emily, as they
proceeded silently, in a kind of sheep
track, that wound along the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irts of
the woods, which ascended on the right,
could not survey the sleeping beauty of
the vale, to which they were declining,
without a momentary sensation of pleasure.
It seemed varied with woods, pastures, and
sloping grounds, and was screened to the
north and the east by an amphitheatre
of the Apennines, whose outline on the ho∣rizon
was here broken into varied and ele∣gant
forms; to the west and the south, the
landscape extended indistinctly into the
lowlands of Tuscany.</P>
<P>”There is the sea yonder,” said Bertrand,
as if he had known that Emily was exa∣mining
the twilight view, ”yonder in the
west, though we cannot see it.”</P>
<P>Emily-already perceived a change in the
climate, from that of the wild and moun∣tainous
tract she had left; and, as she con∣tinued
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
descending, the air became perfumed
by the breath of a thousand nameless flow∣ers
among the grass, called forth by the late
rain. So soothingly beautiful was the
scene around her, and so strikingly con∣trasted
to the gloomy grandeur of those,
to which she had long been confined,
and to the manners of the people, who
moved among them, that she could almost
have fancied herself again at La Vallée,
and, wondering why Montoni had sent
her hither, could scarcely believe, that he
had selected so enchanting a spot for any
cruel design. It was, however, probably
not the spot, but the persons, who happen∣ed
to inhabit it, and to whose care he could
safely commit the execution of his plans,
whatever they might be, that had deter∣mined
his choice.</P>
<P>She now ventured again to enquire,
whether they were near the place of their
destination, and was answered by Ugo, that
they had not far to go. ”Only to the
wood of chesnuts in the valley yonder,
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
said he, ”there, by the brook, that sparkles
with the moon I wish I was once at rest
there, with a flask of good wine, and a
slice of Tuscany bacon.”</P>
<P>Emily's spirits revived, when she heard,
that the journey was so nearly concluded,
and saw the wood of chesnuts in an open
part of the vale, on the margin of the
stream.</P>
<P>In a-short time, they reached the entrance
of the wood, and perceived, between the
twinkling leaves, a light, streaming from a
distant cottage window. They proceeded
along the edge of the brook to where the
trees, crowding over it; excluded the moon∣beams,
but a long line of light, from the
cottage above, was seen on its dark tremulous
surface. Bertrand now stepped on
first, and Emily heard him knock, and call
loudly at the door. As she reached it, the
small upper casement, where the light ap∣peared,
was unclosed by a man, who, having
enquired what they wanted, immediately
descended, let them into a neat rustic cor,
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
and called up his wife to set refreshments
before the travellers. As this man con∣versed,
rather apart, with Bertrand, Emily
anxiously surveyed him. He was a tall,
but not robust, peasant, of a fallow com∣plexion,
and had a shrewd and cunning
eye; his countenance was not of a charac∣ter
to win the ready confidence of youth,
and there was nothing in his manner, that
might conciliate a stranger.</P>
<P>Ugo called impatiently for supper, and
in a tone as if he knew his authority here
to be unquestionable. ”I expected you an
hour ago,” said the peasant, ”for I have
had Signor Montoni's letter these three
hours and I and my wife had given you
up, and gone to bed. How did you fare
in the storm?”</P>
<P>Ill enough,” replied Ugo, ”ill enough,
and we are like to fare ill enough here, too,
unless you will make more haste. Get us
more wine, and let us see what you have
to eat.”</P>
<P>The peasant placed before them all, that
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
his cottage afforded—ham, wine, figs, and
grapes of such fize and flavour, as Emily
had seldom tasted.</P>
<P>After saking refreshment, she was shewn
by the peasant's wife to her little bed cham∣ber,
where she asked some questions con∣cerning
Montoni, to which the woman,
whose name was Dorina, gave reserved an∣swers,
pretending ignorance of his <HI>Excel-lenza's</HI>
intention in sending Emily hither,
but acknowledging that her husband had
been apprized of the circumstance. Per∣ceiving,
that she could obtain no intelli∣gence
concerning her destination, Emily
dismissed Dorina, and retired to repose;but
all the busy scenes of the past and the anti∣cipated
ones of the future came to her anx∣ious
mind, and conspired with the sense of
her new situation to banish sleep.</P>

<P>WHEN Emily, in the morning, open∣ed
her casement, she was surprised to observe
the beauties, that surrounded it. The
cottage was nearly embowered in the woods,
which were chiefly of chesnut, intermixed
with some cypress, larch and sycamore.
Beneath the dark and spreading branches
appeared, to the north, and to the east,
the woody Apennines, rising in majestic
amphitheatre, not black with pines, as she
had been accustomed to see them, but their
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
loftiest summits crowned with antient fo∣rests
of chesnut, oak, and oriental plane,
now animated with the rich tints of au∣tumn,
and which swept downward to the
valley uninterruptedly, except where some
bold rocky promontory looked out from
among the foliage, and caught the passing
gleam. Vineyards stretched along the feet
of the mountains, where the elegant villas
of the Tuscan nobility frequently adorned
the scene, and overlooked slopes clothed
with groves of olive, mulberry, orange and
lemon The plain, to which these declined,
was coloured with the riches of cultivation,
whose mingled hues were mellowed into
harmony by an Italian sun Vines, their
purple clusters blushing between the rus∣set
foliage, hung in luxuriant festoons from
the branches of standard fig and cherry
trees, while pastures of verdure, such as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mily had seldom seen in I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aly, enriched
the banks of a stream that, after descending
from the mountains, wound along the land∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cape,
which it reflected, to a bay of the
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
sea. There, far in the west, the waters,
fading into the sky, assumed a tint of the
faintest purple, and the line of separation
between them was, now and then, dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn∣ible
only by the progress of a sail, brighten∣ed
with the sun-beam, along the horizon.</P>
<P>The cottage, which was shaded by the
woods from the intenser rays of the sun,
and was open only to his evening light,
was covered entirely with vines, fig- trees
and jessamine, whose flowers surpaissed in
size and fragrance any that Emily had seen.
These and ripening clusters of grapes hung
round her little casement. The turf, that
grew <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der the woods, was inlaid with a
variety of wild flowers and perfumed herbs,
and, on the opposite margin of the stream,
whose current diffused freshness beneath
the shades, rose a grove of lemon and
orange trees. This, though nearly oppo∣site
to Emily's window, did not interrupt
her prospect, but rather heightened, by
its dark verdure, the effect of the perspec∣tive;
and to her this spot was a bower of
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
sweets, whose charms communicated im∣perceptibly
to her mind so <HI>mewhat</HI> of their
own serenity</P>
<P>She was soon summoned to breakfast.
by the peasant's daughter, a girl about se∣venteen,
of a pleasant countenance, which,
Emily was glad to observe, seemed ani∣mated
with the pure affections of nature,
though the others, that surrounded her,
expressed, more or less, the worst quali∣ties
—cruelty, ferocity cunning and dupli∣city;
of the latter style of countenance,
especially, were those of the peasant and
his wife. Maddelina spoke little, but
what she said was in a soft voice, and with
an air of modesty and complacency, that
interested Emily, who breakfasted at a se∣parate
table with Dorina, while Ugo and
Bertrand were taking a repast of Tuscany
bacon and wine with their host, near the
cottage door; when they had finished which,
Ugo, rising hastily, enquired for his mule,
and Emily learned that he was to return to
Udolpho, while Bertrand remained at the
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
cottage; a cicumstance, Which, though it
did not surprise, distressed her.</P>
<P>When Ugo was departed, Emily pro∣posfed to walk in the neighbouring woods;
but, on being told, that she must not quit
the cottage, without having Bertrand for
her attendant, she withdrew to her own
room. There, as her eyes settled on the
towering Apennines, she recollected the ter∣rific
scenery they had exhibited and the
horrors she had suffered, on the preceding
night, particularly at the moment when
Bertrand had betrayed himself to be an as∣sassin;
and these remembrances awakened
a train of images, which, since they ab∣stracted
her from a consideration of her own
situation, she pursued for some time, and
then arranged in the following lines; pleased
to have discovered any innocent means, by
which she could beguile an hour of mis∣fortune.</P>

<HEAD>THE PILGRIM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This poem and that entitled The Traveller, in vol. ii. have already appeared in a periodical publication.</NOTE></HEAD>
<L>Slow o'er the Apenine, with bleeding feet,</L>
<L>A patient Pilgrim wound his lonely way,</L>
<L>To deck the Lady of Loretto's seat</L>
<L>With all the little wealth his zeal could pay.</L>
<L>From mountain-tops cold1 died the evening ray,</L>
<L>And, stretch'd in twilight, slept the vale below;</L>

<L>Along the melancholy West fade slow,</L>
<L>High o'er his head, the restless pines complain,</L>
<L>As on their summit rolls the breeze of night;</L>
<L>Beneath, the hoarse stream chides the rocks in vain:</L>
<L>The Pilgrim pauses on the dizzy height.</L>
<L>Then to the vale his cautious step he prest,</L>
<L>For there-a hermit's cross was dimly seen,</L>
<L>Cresting the rock, and there his limbs might rest.</L>

<P><PB N="204" REF="206"/>
Preferring the solitude of her room to the
company of the persons below stairs, Emily
dined above, and Maddelina was suffered to
attend her, from whose simple conversation
she learned, that the peasant and his wife
were old inhabitants of this cottage, which
had been purchased for them by Montoni,
in reward of some service, rendered him,
many years before, by Marco, to whom
Carlo, the steward at the castle, was
nearly related. “So many years ago, Signora,”
added Maddelina, “that I know nothing
about it; but my father did the Signer a
great good, for my mother has often said
to him, this cottage was the least he ought
to have had.”</P>
<P>To the mention of this circumstance
Emily listened with a painful interest, since
it appeared to give a frightful colour to
the character of Marco, whose service,
thus rewarded by Montoni, she could
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arcely doubt had been criminal; and, if
so, had too much reason to believe, that she had been committed into his hands for some desperate purpose. “Did you ever hear
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
how many years it is,” said Emily, who
was considering of Signora Laurentini's
disappearance from Udolpho, “since your
father performed the services you spoke
of?”</P>
<P>“It was a little before he came to live at
the cottage, Signora,” replied Maddelina,
“and that is about eighteen years ago.”</P>
<P>This was near the period, when Signora
Laurentini had been said to disappear, and
it occurred to Emily, that Marco had af∣sisted
in that mysterious affair, and, per∣haps,
had been employed in a murder!
This horrible suggestion fixed her in such
profound reverie, that Maddelina quitted
the room, unperceived by her, and she re∣mained
unconfcious of all around her,
for a considerable time. Tears, at length,
came to her relief, after indulging which,
her spirits becoming calmer, she ceased to
tremble at a view of evils, that might ne∣ver
arrive; and had sufficient resolution
to endeavour to withdraw her thoughts
from the contemplation of her own in∣terests.
Remembering the few books,
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
which even in the hurry of her departure
from Udolpho she had put into her little
package, she sat down with one of them
at her pleasant casement, whence her eyes
often wandered from the page to the land∣scape,
whose beauty gradually soothed her
mind into gentle melancholy.</P>
<P>Here, she remained alone, till evening,
and saw the sun descend the wester<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sky, throw all his pomp of light and shadow
upon the mountains, and gleam upon the
distant ocean and the stealing sails, as he
sunk amidst the waves. Then, at the mus∣ing
hour of twilight, her softened thoughts
returned to Valancourt; she again recol∣lected
every circumstance, connected with
the midnight music, and all that might as∣sist her conjecture, concerning his
imprison∣ment
at the castle, and, becoming con∣firmed
in the supposition, that it was his
voice she had heard there, she looked back
to that gloomy abode with emotions of grief
and momentary regret</P>
<P>Refreshed by the cool and fragrant air,
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
and her spirits soothed to a state of gentle
melancholy by the stilly murmur of the
brook below and of the woods around, she lingered at her casement long after the sun
had set, watching the valley sinking into
obscurity, till only the grand outline of the
surrounding mountains, shadowed upon
the horizon, remained visible. But a clear
moon-light, that succeeded, gave to the
landscape, what time gives to the scenes
of past life, when it softens all their harsh∣er
features, and throws over the whole
the mellowing shade of distant contempla∣tion.
The scenes of La Vallée, in the early morn of her
life, when she was protected
and beloved by parents equally loved, ap∣peared
in Emily's memory tenderly beau∣tiful,
like the prospect before her, and
awakened mournful comparisons Un∣willing
to encounter the coarse behaviour
of the peasant's wife, she remained
supper∣less in her room, while she wept
again over her forlorn and perilous situation, a
review of which entirely overcame the small re∣mains
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
of her fortitude, and, reducing her
to temporary despondence, she wished to
be released from this heavy load of life, that
had so long oppressed her, and prayed to
Heaven to take her, in its mercy, to her
parents.</P>
<P>Wearied with weeping, she, at length,
lay down on her mattress, and sunk to
sleep, but was soon awakened by a knock∣ing
at her chamber door, and, starting up
in terror, she heard a voice calling her.
The image of Bertrand, with a stilletto in
his hand, appeared to her alarmed fancy,
and she neither opened the door, or an∣swered, but listened in profound silence, till, the voice repeating her name in the
same low tone, she demanded who called.
“It is I, Signora,” replied the voice, which
she now distinguished to be Maddelina's,
“pray open the door. Don't be frighten∣ed,
it is I”.</P>
<P>“And what brings you here so late,
Maddelina?” said Emily, as she let her in
“Hush! Signora, for heaven's sake hush!
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
—if we are overheard I shall never be for∣given.
My father and mother and Ber∣trand
are all gone to bed,” continued
Maddelina, as she gently shut the door,
and crept forward, “and I have brought
you some supper, for you had none, you
know, Signora, below stairs Here are
some grapes and figs and half a cup of wine.”
Emily thanked her, but expressed
apprehension left this kindness should draw
upon her the resentment of Dorina, when
she perceived the fruit was gone. “Take it
back, therefore, Maddelina,” added Emily,
“I shall suffer much less from the
want of
it, than I should do, if this act of good∣nature
was to subject you to your mother's
displeasure.”</P>
<P>“O Signora! there is no danger of that,”
replied Maddelina, “my mother cannot
miss the fruit, for I saved it from my own
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upper. You will make me very unhappy,
if you refuse to take it, Signora.” Emily
was so much affected by this instance of
the good girl's generosity, that she remained
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
for some time unable to reply, and Mad∣delina
watched her in silence, till, mistak∣ing
the cause of her emotion, she said, “Do
not weep so, Signora! My mother, to be
sure, is a little cross, sometimes, but then
it is soon over,—so don't take it so much
to heart. She often scolds me, too, but then
I have learned to bear it, and, when she has
done, if I can but steal out into the
woods, and play upon my sticcado, I for∣get
it all directly.”</P>
<P>Emily, smiling through her tears, told
Maddelina, that she was a good girl, and then
accepted her offering. She wished
anxiously to know, whether Bertrand and
Dorina had spoken of Montoni, or of his
designs, concerning herself, in the presence
of Maddelina, but disdained to tempt the
innocent girl to a conduct so mean, as that
of betraying the private conversation of her
parents. When she was departing, Emily
requested, that she would come to her
room as often as she dared, without offend∣ing
her mother, and Maddelina, after pro∣mising,
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
that she would do so, stole softly
back gain to her own chamber</P>
<P>Thus several days passed, during
which Emily remained in her own room, Mad∣delina
attending her only at her repast,
whose gentle countenance and manners
soothed her more than any circumstance
she had known for many months. Of her
pleasant embowered chamber she now be∣came
fond, and began to experience in it
those feelings of security, which we natu∣rally
attach to home. In this interval also,
her mind, having been undisturbed by
any new circumstance of disgust, or alarm,
recovered its tone sufficiently to permit her
the enjoyment of her books, among which
she found some unfinished sketches of
land∣scapes, several blank sheets of paper,
with her drawing instruments, and she was
thus enabled to amuse herself with selecting
some of the lovely features of the prospect,

them in scenes, to which her taste∣ful

<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
sketches she generally placed interesting
groups, characteristic of the scenery they
animated, and often contrived to tell,
with perspicuity, some simple and affect∣ing
story, when, as a tear fell over the
pictured griefs, which her imagination
drew, she would forget, for a moment,
her real sufferings. Thus innocently she
beguiled the heavy hours of misfortune,
and, with meek patience, awai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the
events of futurity.</P>
<P>A beautiful evening, that had succeeded
to a sultry day, at length induced Emily to
walk, though she knew that Bertrand must
attend her, and, with Maddelina for her
companion, she left the cottage, followed
by Bertrand, who allowed her to choose
her own way. The hour was cool and
silent, and she could not look upon the
country around her, without delight. How
lovely, too, appeared the brilliant blue,
that coloured all the upper region of the
air, and, thence fading downward, was
lost in the saffron glow of the horizon!
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
Nor <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o were the varied shades and
warm colouring of the Apennines, as the
evening sun threw his slanting rays athwart
their broken surface. Emily followed the
course of the stream, under the shades,
that overhung its grassy margin. On the
opposite banks, the pastures were animated
with herds of cattle of a beautiful cream∣colour;
and, beyond, were groves of le∣mon
and orange, with fruit glowing on the
branches, frequent almost as the leaves,
which partly concealed it. She pursued
her way towards the sea, which reflected
the warm glow of sun-set, while the cliffs,
that rose over its edge, were tinted with
the last rays. The valley was terminated
on the right by a lofty promontory, whose
summit, impending over the waves, was
crowned with a ruined tower, now serving
for the purpose of a beacon, whose shat∣tered
battlements and the extended wings
of some sea-fowl, that circled near it, were
still illumined by the upward beams of the
sun, though his disk was now sunk beneath
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
the horizon; while the lower part of the
ruin, the cliff on which it stood and the
waves at its foot, were shaded with the
first tints of twilight.</P>
<P>Having reached this headland, Emily
gazed with solemn pleasure on the cliffs,
that extended on either hand along the
se∣questered shores, some crowned with
groves of pine, and others exhibiting only barren
precipices of a grayish marble, except
where the crags were tufted with myrtle
and other aromatic shrubs. The sea slept
in a perfect calm; its waves, dying in
murmurs on the shores, flowed with the
gentlest undulation, while its clear surface
reflected in softened beauty the vermeil
tints of the west. Emily, as she looked
upon the ocean, thought of France and
of past times, and she wished, Oh! how
ardently, and vainly—wished! that its
waves would bear her to her distant, na∣tive
home!</P>
<P>“Ah! that vessel,” said she, “that vessel, which glides along so stately, with
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
its tall sails reflected in the water, is, per∣haps,
bound for France! Happy—happy
bark!” She continued to gaze upon it,
with warm emotion, till the gray of twi∣light
obscured the di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance, and veiled it
from her view. The melancholy sound of
the waves at her feet assisted the tender∣ness, that occasioned her tears, and
this was the only sound, that broke upon the
hour, till, having followed the windings
of the beach, for some time, a chorus of
voices passed her on the air. She paused
a moment, wishing to hear more, yet fear∣ing
to be seen, and, for the first time, looked
back to Ber<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and, as her protector, who
was following, at a short distance, in com∣pany
with some other person. Reassured
by this circumstance, she advanced to∣wards
the sounds, which seemed to arise
from behind a high promontory, that
projected athwart the beach There was
now a sudden pause in the music, and then
one female voice was heard to sing in a
kind of chant Emily quickened her
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
steps, and, winding round the rock, saw
within the sweeping bay, beyond, which
was hung with woods from the borders of
the beach to the very summit of the cliffs,
two groups of peasants, one seated beneath
the shades, and the other standing on the
edge of the sea, round the girl,“who was
singing, and who held in her hand a chap∣let
of flowers, which she seemed about to
drop into the waves</P>
<P>Emily, listening with surprise and atten∣tion,
distinguished the following
invocation delivered in the pure and elegant
tongue of Tuscany and accompanied by a few pas∣toral
instruments.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TO A SEA-NYMPH</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>O nymph! who loves to float on the green wave,</L>
<L>When Neptune sleeps beneath the moon-Iight hour,</L>
<L>Lull'd by thy music's melancholy pow'r,</L>
<L>O nymph, arise from out thy pearly cave!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Helper beams amid the twilight shade,</L>
<L>And soon shall Cynthia tremble o'er the tide,</L>
<L>Gleam on these cliffs, that bound the ocean's pride,</L>
<L>And lonely silence all the air pervade</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
<L>Then, let thy tender voice at disstance swell,</L>
<L>And steal along this solitary shore,</L>
<L>Sink on the breeze, till dying—heard no more—</L>
<L>Thou wak'st the sudden magic of thy shell</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While the long coast in echo sweet replies,</L>
<L>Thy soothing strains the pensive heart beguile,</L>
<L>And bid the visions of the future smile,</L>
<L>O nymph! from out thy pearly cave—arise!</L>
</LG>
<Q><L>(Chorus)—<HI>Arise!</HI></L>
<L>(Semi-chorus)—<HI>Arise!</HI></L></Q>
<P>The last words being repeated by the
surrounding group, the garland of flowers
was thrown into the waves, and the chorus,
sinking gradually into a chant, died away
in silence.</P>
<P>“What can this mean, Maddelina?” said
Emily, awakening from the pleasing trance,
into which the musie had lulled her.
“This is the eve of a festival, Signora,”
replied Maddelina; “and the peasants then
amuse themselves with all kinds of sports.”</P>
<P>“But they talked of a sea-nymph,” said
Emily: “how came these good people to
think of a sea-nymph”?</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="220"/>
“O, Signora,” rejoined Maddelina, mis∣taking
the reason of Emily's surprise, “no∣body
<HI>believes</HI> in such things, but our old
songs tell of them, and, when we are at
our sports, we sometimes sing to them,
and throw garlands into the sea.”</P>
<P>Emily had been early taught to vene∣rate
Florence as the seat of literature and
of the fine arts; but, that its taste for clas∣sic
story should descend to the peasants of
the country, occasioned her both surprise
and admiration. The Arcadian air of the
girls next attracted her attention. Their
dress was a very short full petticoat of light
green, with a boddice of white silk; the
sleeves loose, and tied up at the shoulders
with ribbons and bunches of flowers. Their
hair, falling in ringlets on their necks,
was also ornamented with flowers, and with
a small straw hat, which, set rather back∣ward
and on one side of the head, gave an
expression of gaiety and smartness to the
whole figure. When the song had con∣cluded,
several of these girls approached
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
Emily, and, inviting her to sit down
among them, offered her, and Maddelina,
whom they knew, grapes and figs.</P>
<P>Emily accepted their courtesy, much
pleased with the gentleness and grace of
their manners, which appeared to be per∣fectly
natural to them: and when Bertrand,
soon after, approached, and was hastily
drawing her away, a peasant, holding up
a flask, invited him to drink; a tempta∣tion,
which Bertrand was seldom very va∣liant
in resisting.</P>
<P>“Let the young lady join in the dance,
my friend, ”said the peasant,“ while we
empty this flask. They are going to begin
directly. Strike up! my lads, strike up
your tambourines and merry flutes!”</P>
<P>They sounded gaily; and the younger
peasants formed themselves into a circle,
which Emily would readily have joined, had
her spirits been in unison with their, mirth.
Maddelina, however, tripped it lightly, and
Emily, as she looked on the happy group,
lost the sense of her misfortunes in that of
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
a benevolent pleasure. But the pensive
melancholy of her mind returned, as she
sat rather apart from the company, listening
to the mellow music, which the breeze soft∣ened
as it, bore it away, and watching the
moon, stealing its tremulous light over the
waves and on the woody summits of the
cliffs, that wound along these Tuscan
shores.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Bertrand was so well pleased
with his first flask, that he very willingly
commenced the attack of a second, and it
was late before Emily, not without some
apprehension, returned to the cottage.</P>
<P>After this evening, she frequently walked
with Maddelina, but was never unattended
by Bertrand; and her mind became by
degrees as tranquil as the circumstances of
her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ituation would permit. The quiet, in
which she was suffered to live, encouraged
her to hope, that she was not sent hither
with an evil design; and, had it not ap∣peared
probable, that Valancourt was at
this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime an inhabitant of Udolpho, she
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
would have wished to remain at the cot∣tage,
till an opportunity should offer of
returning to her native country. But,
concerning Montoni's motive for sending
her into Tuscany, she was more than ever
perplexed, nor could she believe that any
consideration for her safety had influenced
him on this occasion.</P>
<P>She had been some time at the cottage,
before she recollected, that, in the hurry
of leaving Udolpho, she had forgotten the
papers committed to her by her late aunt,
relative to the Languedoc estates; but,
though this remembrance occasioned her
much uneasiness, she had some hope,
that, in the obscure place, where they were de∣posited,
they would escape the detection
of Montoni.</P>

<BIBL>RlCHARD II.</BIBL></Q>
<P>We now return, for a moment, to
Venice, where Count Morano was suffer∣ing
under an accumulation of misfortunes.
Soon after his arrival in that city, he had
been arrested by order of the Senate, and,
without knowing of what he was suspected,
was conveyed to a place of confinement,
whither the most strenuous enquiries of his
friends had been unable to trace him.
Who the enemy was, that had occasioned
him this calamity, he had not been able
to guess, unless, indeed, it was Montoni,
on whom his suspicions rested, and not
only with much apparent probability, but
with justice.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225"/>
In the affair of the poisoned cup, Mon∣toni
had<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suspected Morano; but, being
unable to obtain the degree of proof,
which was necessary to convict him of a
guilty intention he had recourse to means
of other revenge, than he could hope to
obtain by prosecution. He employed a
person, in whom he believed he might
confide, to drop a letter of accusation into
the <HI>Denunzie secrete,</HI> or lions' mouths,
which are fixed in a gallery of the Doge's
palace, as receptacles for anonymous infor∣mation,
concerning persons, who may be
disaffected towards the state. As, on these
occasions, the accuser is not confronted with
the accused, a man may falsely impeach his
enemy, and accomplish an unjust revenge,
without fear of punishment, or detection.
That Montoni should have recourse to
these diabolical means of ruining a person,
whom he suspected of having attempted
his life, is not in the least surprising. In
the letter, which he had employed as the
instrument of his revenge, he accused
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
Morano'of designs against the stat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which
he attempted to prove, with all the plau∣sible
simplicity of which he was masters;
and the senate, with whom a suspicion was,
at that time, almost equal to a proof, ar∣rested
the Count, in consequence of this
accusation; and, without even hinting to
him his crime, threw him into one of
those secret prisons, which were the terror
of the Venetians, and in which persons
often languished, and sometimes died,
without being discovered by their friends.</P>
<P>Morano had incurred the personal re∣sentment
of many m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbers of the state;
his habits of life had rendered him obnoxi∣ous
to some; and his ambition, and the
bold rivalship, which he discovered, on
several public occasions,—to others; and
it was not to be expected, that mercy
would soften the rigour of a law, which
was to be dispensed from the hands of his
enemies</P>
<P>Montoni, meantime, was beset by dan∣gers
of another kind His castle was b∣sieged
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
by troops, who seemed willing to
dare every thing, and to suffer patiently
any hardships in pursuit of victory. The
strength of the fortress, however, withstood
their attack, and this, with the vigorous
defence of the garrison and the scarcity
of provision on these wild mountains, soon
compelled the assailants to raise the siege.</P>
<P>When Udolpho was once more left to
the quiet possession of Montoni, he dis∣patched
Ugo into Tuscany for Emily,
whom he had sent from considerations of
her personal safety, to a place of greater
security, than a castle, which was, at that
time, liable to be overrun by his ene∣mies.
Tranquillity being once more re∣stored
to Udolpho, he was impatient to
secure her again under his roof, and had
commissioned Ugo to assist Bertrand in
guarding her back to the castle. Thus
compelled to return, Emily bade the kind
Maddelina farewell, with regret, and, af∣ter
about a fortnight's stay in Tuscany,
where she had experienced an interval of
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
quiet, which was absolutely necessary to
sustain her long-harassed spirits, began once
more to ascend the Apennines, from whose
heights she gave a long and sorrowful look
to the beautiful country, that extended at
their feet, and to the distant Mediterranean,
whose waves she had so often wished would
bear her back to France. The distress she
felt, on her return towards the place of her
former sufferings, was, however, softened
by a conjecture, that Valancourt was there,
and she found some degree of comfort in
the thought of being near him, notwith∣standing
the consideration, that he was pro∣bably
a prisoner.</P>
<P>It was noon, when she had left the cot∣tage,
and the evening was closed, long before
she came within the neighbourhood of
Udolpho. There was a moon, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it
shone only at intervals, for the night was
cloudy, and, lighted by the torch, Which
Ugo carried, the travellers paced silently
along, Emily musing on her situation, and
Bertrand and Ugo anticipating the comforts
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
of a flask of wine and a good fire, for they
had perceived for some time the difference
between the warm climate of the lowlands
of Tuscany and the nipping air of these
upper regions. Emily was, at length,
roused from her reverie by the far-off
sound of the castle clock, to which she listen∣ed
not without some degree of awe, as it rolled
away on the breeze. Another and another
note succeeded, and died in sullen mur∣mur
among the mountains:—to her mourn∣ful
imagination it seemed a knell measuring
out some fateful period for her.</P>
<P>“Aye, there is the old clock, ” said Ber∣trand,
“there he is still; the cannon
have not silenced him!”</P>
<P>“No,” answered Ugo, “he crowed as
loud as the best of them in the midst of it
all. There he was roaring out in the
hottest fire 1 have seen this many a day!
I said that some of them would have a
hit at the old fellow, but he escaped, and
the tower too.”</P>
<P>The road winding round the base of a
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
mountain, they now came within view of
the castle, which was shewn in the perspec∣tive
of the valley by a gleam of moon∣shine,
and then vanished in shade; while
even a transient view of it had awakened
the poignancy of Emily's feelings. Its
massy and gloomy walls gave her terri∣ble
ideas of imprisonment and suffering:
yet, as she advanced, some degree of hope
mingled with her terror; for, though this
was certainly the residence of Montoni,
it was possibly, also, that of Valancourt, and
she could not approach a place, where he
might be, without experiencing somewhat
of the joy of hope.</P>
<P>They continued to wind along the val∣ley,
and, soon after, she saw again the
old walls and moon-light towers, rising
over the woods: the strong rays ena∣bled
her, also, to perceive the ravages,
which the siege had made,—with the
broken walls, and shattered battlements,
for they were now at the foot of the steep,
on which Udolpho stood Massy frag∣ments
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
had rolled down among the woods,
through which the travellers now began to
ascend, and there mingled with the loose
earth, and pieces of rock they had brought
with them. The woods, too, had suffered
much from the batteries above, for here
the enemy had endeavoured to screen them∣selves
from the fire of the ramparts. Many
noble trees were levelled with the ground,
and others, to a wide extent, were entirely
stripped of their upper branches. “We
had better dismount,” said Ugo, “and
lead the mules up the hill, or we shall get
into some of the holes, which the balls
have left. Here are plenty of them. Give
me the torch,” continued Ugo, after they
had dismounted, “and take care you
don't stumble over any thing, that lies in
your way, for the ground is not yet cleared
of the enemy,”</P>
<P>“How!” exclaimed Emily.“ are any of the enemy here, then?”
“Nay, I don't know for that, now,” he
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
replied, “but when I came away I saw
one or two of them lying under the trees<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>”</P>
<P>As they proceeded, the torch threw a
gloomy light upon the ground, and far
among the recesses of the woods, and
Emily feared to look forward, left some
object of horror should meet her eye.
The path was often strewn with broken
heads of arrows, and with shattered re∣mains
of armour, such as at that period
was mingled with the lighter dress of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldiers. “Bring the light hither,” said
Bertrand, “I have stumbled over some∣thing,
that rattles loud enough.” Ugo
holding up the torch, they perceived a
steel breast- plate on the ground, which
Bertrand raifsed, and they saw, that it was
pierced through, and that the lining was
entirely covered with blood; but upon
Emily's earnest entreaties, that they would
proceed, Bertrand, uttering some joke up∣on
the unfortunate person, to whom it had
belonged, threw it hard upon the ground,
and<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>they passed on.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="233"/>
At every step she took, Emily feared to
see some vestige of death. Coming soon
after to an opening in the woods, Bertrand
stopped to survey the ground, which was
encumbered with massy trunks and branches
of the trees, that had so lately adorned it,
and seemed to have been a spot particu∣larly
fatal to the besiegers; for it was evident
from the destruction of the trees, that
here the hottest fire of the garrison had
been directed. As Ugo held again forth
the torch, steel glittered between the fallen
trees; the ground beneath was covered
with broken arms, and with the torn vest∣ments
of soldiers, whose mangled forms
Emily almost expected to see; and she
again entreated her companions to pro∣ceed,
who were, however, too intent in
their examination, to regard her, and she
turned her eyes frem this desolated scene
to the castle above, where she observed
lights gliding along the ramparts. Pre∣sently,
the castle clock struck twelve, and
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
then a trumpet sounded, of which Emily
enquired the occasion.</P>
<P>“O! they are only changing watch,”
replied Ugo. “I do not remember this
trumpet,” said Emily, “it is a new cus∣tom.”
“It is only an old one revived,
lady; we always use it in time of war.
We have sounded it, at midnight, ever
since the place was besieged.”</P>
<P>“Hark!”said Emily, as the trumpet
founded again; and, in the next moment,
she heard a faint clash of arms, and then
the watch-word passed along the terrace
above, and was answered from a distant
part of the castle; after which all was again
still. She complained of cold, and begged
to go on. “Presently, lady,” said Ber∣trand,
turning over some broken arms
with the pike he usually carried. “What
have we here?”</P>
<P>“Hark!” cried Emily, “what noise was
that?”</P>
<P>“What noise was it?” said Ugo, start∣ing
up and listening.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="235"/>
“Hush!” repeated Emily “It surely
came from the ramparts above.” and, on
looking up, they perceived a light moving
along the walls, while, in the next instant,
the breeze swelling, the voice sounded
louder than before.</P>
<P>“Who goes yonder?” cried a sentinel
of the castle. “Speak, or it will be worse
for you.” Bertrand uttered a shout of joy.
“Hah! my brave comrade, is it you?”
said he, and he blew a shrill whistle, which
signal was answer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by another from the
soldier on watch; and the party, then
passing forward, soon after emerged from
the woods upon the broken road, that led
immediately to the castle gates, and Emily
saw, with renewed terror, the whole of
that stupendous structure. “Alas!” said
she to herself, “I am going again into my
prison!”</P>
<P>“Here has, been warm work, by St.
Marco!”cried Bertrand, waving the torch
over the ground; the balls have torn up
the earth here, with a vengeance.”</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="236"/>
“Aye,” replied Ugo, “they were fired
from that redoubt, yonder, and rare exe∣cution
they did. The enemy made a fu∣rious
attack upon the great gates; but
they might have guessed they could never
carry it there; for, besides the cannon from
the walls, our archers, on the two roun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
towers, showered down upon them at such
a rate, that, by holy Peter! there was no
standing it. I never saw a better sight in
my life; I laughed, till my sides aked, to
see how the knaves scampered Bertrand,
my good fellow, thou shouldst have been
among them; I warrant thou wouldst
have won the race!”</P>
<P>“Hah! you are at your old tricks
again,” said Bertrand in a surly tone. “It
is well for thee thou art so near the castle;
thou knowest I have killed my man before
now” Ugo replied only by a laugh, and
then gave some further account of the siege,
to which as Emily listened, she was struck by the strong contrast of the present scene
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
with that which had so lately been acted
here.</P>
<P>The mingled uproar of cannon, drums,
and trumpets, the groans of the conquered,
and the shouts of the conquerors were now
sunk into a silence so profound, that it
seemed as if death had triumphed alike
over the vanquished and the victor. The
shattered condition of one of the towers of the
great gates by no means confirmed the
<HI>valiant</HI> account just given by Ugo of the
scampering party, who, it was evident, had
not only made a stand, but had done much
mischief before they took to flight; for this
tower appeared, as far as Emily could
judge by the dim moon-light that fell
upon it, to be laid open, and the battle∣ments
were nearly demolished. While she
gazed, a light glimmered through one of the lower
loop-holes, and disappeared; but,
in the next moment, she perceived through
the broken wall, a soldier, with a lamp, as∣cending
the narrow stair-case, that wound
within the tower, and, remembering that
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
it was the same she had passed up, on the
night; when Barnardine had deluded her
with a promise of seeing Madame Montoni,
fancy gave her somewhat of the terror she
had then suffered She was now very
near the gates, over which the soldier
having opened the door of the portal-chamber,
the lamp he carried gave her a
dusky view of that terrible apartment,
and she almost sunk under the recollected
horrors of the moment, when she had
drawn aside the curtain, and discovered the
object it was meant to conceal</P>
<P>“Perhaps, “said she to herself, “it is
now used for a similar purpose; perhaps
that soldier goes, at this dead hour, to
watch over the corpse of his friend!” The
little remaines of her fortitude now gave
way to the united force of remembered and
anticipated horrors, for the melancholy fate
of Madame Montoni appeared to foretell
her own She considered, that, though
the Languedoc estates, if she relinquished
them, would satisfy Montoni's avarice,
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
they might not appease his vengeance,
which was seldom pacified but by a terri∣ble
sacrifice; and she even thought, that,
were she to resign them, the fear of justice
might urge him either to detain her a pri∣soner,
or to take away her life</P>
<P>They were now arrived at the gates,
where Bertrand, observing the light glim∣mer
through a small casement of the
portal-chamber, called aloud; and the
soldier, looking out, demanded who was
there “Here, I have brought you a
prisoner,” said Ugo, “open the gate, and
let us in.”</P>
<P>“Tell me first who it is, that demands
entrance,”replied the soldier. “What!
my old comrade,' cried Ugo, “don't you
know me? not know Ugo? I have brought
home a prisoner here, bound hand and foot
—a fellow, who has been drinking Tuscany
wine, while we here have been fighting.”</P>
<P>“You will not rest till you meet with your
match,“said Bertrand sullenly “Hah! my
<PB N="238" REF="240"/>
comrade, is it you?“said the soldier—“I'll
be with, you directly.”</P>
<P>Emily presently heard his steps descend∣ing
the stairs within, and then the heavy
chain fall, and the bolts undraw of a small postern door, which he opened to admit
the party. He held the lamp low, to
shew the step of the gate, and she found
herself once more beneath the gloomy arch,
and heard the door close, that seemed to
shut her from the world for ever. In the
next moment, she was in the first court of
the castle, where she surveyed the spacious
and solitary area, with a kind of calm de∣spair;
while the dead hour of the night,
the gothic gloom of the surrounding build∣ings,
and the hollow and imperfect echoes,
which they returned, as Ugo and the sol∣dier
conversed together, assisted to increase
the melancholy forebodings of her heart.
Passing on to the second court, a distant
sound broke feebly on the silence, and gra∣dually
swelling louder, as they advanced,</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="241"/>
Emily distinguished voices of revelry and
laughter, but they were to her far other
than sounds of joy. “Why, you have
got some Tuscanywine among you, <HI>here,</HI>”
said Bertrand, “if one may judge by the
uproar that is going forward. Ugo has taken a larger share of that than of fight∣ing,
I'II be sworn. Who is carousing at
this late hour?”</P>
<P>“His <HI>Excellenza</HI> and the Signors,” replied
the soldier: “it is-a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-sign you are a
stranger at the castle, or you would not
need to ask the question. They are brave
spirits, that do without sleep—they gene∣rally
pass the night in good cheer; would
that we, who keep the watch, had a little
of it! It is cold work, pacing the ramparts
so many hours of the night, if one has no
good liquor to warm one's heart.”</P>
<P>“Courage, my lad, courage ought to
warm your heart” said Ugo. “Courage!”
replied the soldier sharply, with a menacing
air, which Ugo perceiving, prevented his
saying more, by returning to the subject of
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
the carousal. “This is a new custom,”
said he; “when I left the castle, the Sig∣nors
used to sit up counselling.”</P>
<P>“Aye, and for that matter, carousing
too,” replied Ugo, “but, since the siege,
they have done nothing but make merry:
and if I was they, I would settle accounts
with myself, for all my hard fighting,
the same way”</P>
<P>They had now crossed the second court,
and reached the hall door, when the sol∣dier,
bidding them good night, hastened
back to his post; and, while they waited
for admittance, Emily considered how she
might avoid seeing Montoni, and retire un∣noticed
to her former apartment, for she
shrunk from the thought of encountering
either him, or any of his party, at this
hour. The uproar within the castle was
now so loud, that<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> though Ugo knocked re∣peatedly
at the hall door, he was not heard
by any of the servants, a circumstance,
which increased Emily's alarm, while it al∣lowed
her time to deliberate on the means
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
of retiring unobserved; for, though she
might, perhaps, pass up the great stair∣case
unseen, it was impossible she could find the
way to her chamber, without a light, the
difficulty of procuring which, and the
danger of wandering about the castle,
without one, immediately struck her.
Bertrand had only a torch, and she knew,
that the servants never brought a taper to
the door, for the hall was suffciently light∣ed
by the large tripod lamp, which hung in
the vaulted roof, and, while she should
wait till Annette could bring a taper,
Montoni, or some of his companions, might
discover her</P>
<P>The door was now opened by Carlo; and
Emily, having requested him to send An∣nette
immediately with a light to the great
gallery, where she determined to await her,
passed on with hasty steps towards the stair∣case;
while Bertrand and Ugo, with the
torch, followed old Carlo to the servants'
hall, impatient for supper and the warm
blaze of a wood fire. Emily, lighted only by
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
the feeble rays, which the lamp above
threw between the arches of this extensive
hall, endeavoured to find her way to the
stair∣case, now hid in obscurity; while
the shouts of merriment, that burst from a
remote apartment, served, by heightening
her terror, to increase her perplexity, and
she expected, every instant, to see the door
of that room open, and Montoni and his
companions issue forth. Having, at length,
reached the stair∣case, and found her way
to the top, she seated herself on the last
stair, to await the arrival of Annette; for
the profound darkness of the gallery de∣terred
her from proceeding farther, and,
while she listened for her footstep, she heard
only distant sounds of revelry, which rose
in fullen echoes from among the arcades
below Once she thought she heard a low
sound from the dark gallery behind her;
and, turning her eyes, fancied she saw
something luminous move in it; and,
since she could not, at this moment, sub∣due
the weakness that caused her fears, she
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
quitted her seat, and crept softly down a
few slairs lower.</P>
<P>Annette not yet appearing, Emily now
concluded, that she was gone to bed, and
that nobody chose to call her up; and the
prospect, that presented itself, of passing the
night in darkness, in this place, or in some
other equally forlorn (for she knew it would
be impracticable to find her way through
the intricacies of the galleries to her cham∣ber),
drew tears of mingled terror and
despondency from her eyes</P>
<P>While thus she sat, she fancied she heard
again an odd sound from the gallery, and,
she listened, scarcely daring to breathe, but
the increasing voices below overcame every
other sound. Soon after, she heard Mon∣toni
and his companions burst into the
hall, who spoke, as if they were much in∣toxicated,
and seemed to be advancing
towards the stair∣case. She now remem∣bered,
that they must come this way to their
chamber, and, forgetting all the terrors of
the gallery, hurried towards it with an in∣tention
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
of secreting herself in some of the
passages, that opened beyond, and of en∣deavouring,
when the Signors were retired,
to find her way to her own room, or to that
of Annette, which was in a remote part of
the castle</P>
<P>With extended arms, she crept along the
gallery, still hearing the voices of persons
below, who seemed to stop in conversation
at the foot of the stair∣case, and then
pausing for a moment to listen, half fear∣ful
of going further into the darkness of
the gallery, where she still imagined, from
the noise she had heard, that some person
was lurking, “They are a lready inform∣ed
of my arrival,”said she, “and Montoni
is coming himself to seek me! In the pre∣sent
state of his mind, his purpose must be
desperate”Then, recollecting the scene, that
had passed in the corridor, on the night pre∣ceding
her departure from the castle, “O
Valancourt!”said she, “I must then re∣sign
you for ever To brave any longer
the injustice of Montoni, would not be
<PB N="245" REF="247"/>
fortitude, but rashness.”Still the voices
below did not draw nearer, but they be∣came
louder, and she distinguished those
of Verezzi and Bertolini above the rest,
while the few words she caught made her
listen more anxiously for others. The
conversation seemed to concern herself;
and, having ventured to step a few paces
nearer to the stair-case, she discovered, that
they were disputing about her, each seem∣ing
to claim some former promise of Mon∣toni,
who appeared, at first, inclined to
appease and to persuade them to return to
their wine, but afterwards to be weary of
the dispute, and, saying that he left them
to settle it as they could, was returning
with the rest of the party to the apartment
he had just quitted. Verezzi then stopped
him “Where is she? Signor,”said he, in
a voice of impatience:” tell us where she
is.” “I have already told you that I do
not know,“replied Montoni, who seemed
to be somewhat overcome with wine; but
she is most probably gone to her apart∣ment.”
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
Verezzi and Bertolini now desisted
from the irenquiries, and sprang to the stair-case
together, while Emily, who, during this
discourse, had trembled fo excessively,
that she had with difficulty supported her∣self,
seemed inspired with new strength,
the moment she heard the sound of their
steps, and ran along the gallery, dark as it
was, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leetness of a fawn But,
long before she reached its extremity, the
light, which Verezzi carried, flashed
upon the walls; both appeared, and, in∣ftantly
perceiving Emily, pursued her.
At this moment, Bertolini, whose, steps,
though swift, were not steady, and whose
impatience overcame what little caution
he had hitherto used, stumbled, and fell at
his length. The lamp fell with him, and
was presently expiring on the floor; but
Verezzi, regardless of saving it, seized the
advantage this accident gave him over his ri∣val,
and followed Emily, to whom, however,
the light had shown one of the passages that
branched from the gallery, and she instantly
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
turned into it. Verezzi could just discern
the way she had taken, and this he pursued;
but the sound of her steps soon sunk in
distance, while he, less acquainted with the
passage, was obliged to proceed through the
dark, with caution, lest he should fall down
a flight of steps, such as in this extensive
old castle frequently terminated an ave∣nue.
This passage at length brought
Emily to the corridor, into which her own
chamber. opened, and, not hearing any
footstep, she paused to take breath, and
consider what was the safest design to be
adopted. She had followed this passage,
merely because it was the first that appear∣ed,
and now that she had reached the end
of it, was as perplexed as before. Whither
to go, or how further to find her way in the
dark, she knew not; she was aware only
that she must not seek her apartment, for
there she would certainly be sought, and
her danger increased every instant, while
she remained near it Her spirits and her
breath, however, were so much exhausted,
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
that sshe was compelled to resst, for a few
minutes, at the end of the passsage, and
still she heard no steps approaching As
thus she stood, light glimmered under an
opposite door of the gallery, and, from its
situation, she knew, that it was the door of
that mysterious chamber, where she had
made a discovery so shocking, that she
never remembered it but with the utmost
horror That there should be light in this
chamber, and at this hour, excited her
strong surprise, and she felt a momentary
terror concerning it, which did not permit
her to look again, for her spirits were now
in such a state of weakness, that she almost
expected to see the door slowly open,
and some horrible object appear at it.
Still she listened for a step along the passage,
and looked up it, where, not a ray of light
appearing, she concluded, that Verezzi
had gone back for the lamp; and, be∣lieving
that he would shortiy be there, she
again considered which way she should go,
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
or rather which way she could find in the
dark.</P>
<P>A saint ray still glimmered under the opposite door, but so great, and, perhaps,
so just was her horror of that chamber,
that she would not again have tempted its
secrets, though she had been certain of ob∣taining
the light so important to her safety.
She was still breathing with difficulty, and
resting at the end of the passage, when she
heard a rustling sound, and then a low
voice, so very near her, that it seemed
close to her ear; but she. had presence of
mind to check her emotions, and to re∣main
quite still; in the next moment, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
perceived it to be the voice of Verezzi,
who did not appear to know, that she was
there, but to have spoken to himself.
“The air is fresher here,” said he: this
should be the corridor.” Perhaps, he was
one of those heroes, whose courage can
defy an enemy better than darkness, and
he tried to rally his spirits with the sound
of his own voice. However this might be,
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
he turned to the right, and proceeded,
with the same stealing steps, towards
Emily's apartment, apparently forgetting,
that, in darkness, she could easily elude
his search, even in her chamber; and,
like an intoxicated person, he followed
pertinaciously the one idea, that had possessed
his imagination.</P>
<P>The moment sbe heard his steps steal
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way, she left her station and moved soft∣ly
to the other end of the corridor, deter∣mined
to trust again to chance, and to
quit it by the first avenue she could find;
but, before she could effect this, light
broke upon the walls of the gallery, and,
looking back, she saw Verezzi crossing
it towards her chamber. She now glided
into a, passage, that opened on. the left,
without, as she thought, being perceived;
but, in the next instant, another light,
glimmering at the further end of this pas∣sage,
threw her into new terror. While
she stopped and hesitated which way to go,
the pause allowed her to perceive, that it
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
was Annette, who advanced, and she hur∣ried
to meet her: but her imprudence
again alarmed Emily, on perceiving whom,
she burst into, a scream of joy, and it was
some minutes, before she could be pre∣vailed
with to be silent, or to release her
mistress from the ardent clasp, in which she
held her. When, at length, Emily made
Annette comprehend her danger, they
hurried towards Annette's room which
was in a distant part of the castle. No ap∣prehensions,
however, could yet silence
the latter. “Oh dear ma'amselle,” said
she, as they passed along, “what a terrified
time have I had of it! Oh! I thought I
should have died an hundred times! I ne∣ver
thought I should live to see you again!
and 1, never was so glad to see any body in
my whole life, as I am to see you now.”
“Hark!” cried Emily, we are pur∣sued;
that was the echo of steps!”“No,
ma* amselle,” said Annette, “it was only
the echo of a door shutting; sound runs
along these vaulted passages<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so, that one
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
is continually deceived by it; if one does
but speak, or cough, it makes a noise as
loud as a cannon.” “Then there is the
greater necessity for us to be silent,” said
Emily: “pr'ythee say no more, till we
reach your chamber.” Here, at length,
they arrived, without interruption, and,
Annette having fastened the door., Emily
sat down on her little bed, to recover
breath and composure. To her enquiry,
whether Valancourt was among the prison∣ers
in the castle, Annette replied, that
she had not been able to hear, but that she
knew there were several persons confined.
She then proceeded, in her tedious way,
to give an account of the siege, or rather
a detail of her terrors and various suffer∣ings,
during the attack.. “But,” added
she, “when I heard the shouts of victory
from the ramparts, I thought we were all
taken, and gave myself up for lost, instead
of which, <HI>we</HI> had driven the enemy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>away.
I went then to the north gallery, and saw
a great many of them scampering away
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
among the mountains; but the rampart
walls were all in ruins, as one may say,
and there was a dismal fight to see down
among the woods below, where the poor
fellows were lying in heaps, but were
carried off presently by their comrades.
While the siege was going on, the Signor
was here, and there, and every where,, at
the same time, as Ludovico told me, for
he would not let me see any thing hardly,
and locked me up, as he has often done
before, in a room in the middle of the cat∣tle,
and used to bring me food, and come
and talk with me as often as he could; and
I must say, if it had not been for Ludovico,
I should have died outright.”</P>
<P>“Well, Annette,” said Emily, “and
how have affairs gone on, since the siege?”</P>
<P>O! sad hurly burly doings, ma'am∣selle,”
replied Annette; “the Signors
have done nothing but sit and drink and
game, ever since. They sit up, all night,
and play among themselves, for all those
riches and fine things, they brought in,
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
some time since, when they used to go out
a-robbing, or as good, for days together;
and then they have dreadful quarrels
about, who loses, and who wins. That
fierce Signor Verezzi is always losing, as
they tell me, and Signor Orsino wins from
him, and this makes him very wroth, and
they have had several hard set-to's about it.
Then, all those fine ladies are at the castle
still; and I declare I am frighted, when∣ever
I meet any of them in the passages.”—</P>
<P>“Surely, Annette,” said Emily start∣ing,
“I heard a noise: listen,” After a
long pause, No, ma'amselle,” said
Annette, “it was only the wind in the
gallery; I often hear it, when it shakes
the old doors, at the other end. But
won't you go to bed, ma'amselle? you
surely will not sit up starving, all night.”
Emily now laid herself down on the mat∣tress,
and desired. Annette to leave the
lamp burning on the hearth; having done
which, the latter placed herself beside
Emily, who, however, was not suffered
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
to sleep, for she again thought she heard;
a noise from the passage; and Annette was
again trying to convince her, that it was
only the wind, when footsteps were dif∣tinctly
heard near the door. Annette was
now starting from the bed, but Emily
prevailed with her to remain there, and:
listened with her in a state of terrible expec∣tation.
The steps still loitered at the door,
when presently an attempt was made on
the lock, and, in the next instant, a voice
called. “For heaven's sake, Annette,
do not answer,” said Emily softly, “re∣main
quite still; but I fear we must extin∣guish
the lamp, or its glare will betray
us.” “Holy Virgin!” exclaimed An∣nette,
forgetting her discretion, “I would
not be in darkness now for the whole
world.” While she spoke, the voice be∣came
louder than before, and repeated
Annette's name; “Blessed Virgin!” cried
she suddenly, “it is only Ludovico,”
She rose to open the door, but Emily pre∣vented
her, till they should be more cer∣tain,
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
that it was he alone; with whom
Annette,<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at length, talked for some time,
and learned, that he was come to enquire
after herself, whom he had let out of her
room to go to Emily, and that he was now
returned to lock her in again. Emily,
fearful of being overheard, if they con∣versed
any longer through the door, con∣sented
that it should be opened, and a young man
appeared, whose open coun∣tenance
confirmed the. favourable opinion
of him, which his care of Annette had al∣ready
prompted her to form. She en∣treated
his protection, sould Verezzi
make this requisite; and Ludovico offered
to pass the night in an old chamber, ad∣joining,
that opened from the gallery, and,
on the first alarm, to come to their de∣fence.</P>
<P>Emily was much soothed by this pro∣posal;
and Ludovico, having lighted his
lamp, went to his station, while she, once
more, endeavoured to repose on her
mat∣tress. But a variety of interests
pressed
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
upon her attention, and prevented sleep.
She thought much on what Annétte had
told her of the dissolute manners of Mon∣toni
and his associates, and more of his
present conduct towards herself, and of
the danger, from which she had just es∣caped.
From the view of her present situ∣ation
she shrunk, as from a new picture of
terror. She saw herself in a castle, inha∣bited
by vice and violence, seated beyond
the reach of law, or justice, and in the
power of a man, whose perseverance was
equal to every occasion, and in whom pas∣sions,
of which revenge was not the weak∣est,
entirely supplied the place of principles.
She was compelled, once more, to ac∣knowledge,
that it would be folly, and
not fortitude, any longer to dare his
power; and, resigning all hopes of future
happiness with Valancourt, she deter∣mined,
that, on the following morning,
she would compromise with Montoni,
and give up her estates, on condition,
that he would permit her immediate return
to France. Such considerations kept her
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
waking for many hours; but, the night
passed, without further alarm from Verezzi.</P>
<P>On the next morning, Emily had a
long conversation with Ludovico, in which
she heard circumstances concerning the
castle, and received hints of the designs
of Montoni, that considerably increased
her alarms. On expressing her surprise, that Ludovico, who seemed to be so sen∣sible
of the evils of his situation, should
continue in it, he informed her, that it
was not his intention to do so, and she
then ventured to ask him, if he would
assist her to escape from the castle. Lu∣dovico
assured her of his readiness to at∣tempt
this, but strongly represented the
difficulty of the enterprise, and the cer∣tain
destruction which must ensue, should Montoni overtake them, before they had
passed the mountains; he, however, pro∣mised
to be watchful of every circum∣stance,
that might contribute to the suc∣cess
of the attempt, and to think upon
some plan of departure.</P>
<P>Emily now confided to him the name of
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
Valancourt, and begged he would enquire
for such a person among the prisoners in
the castle; for the saint hope, which this
conversation awakened, made her now re∣cede
from her resolution of an immediate
compromise wich Montoni. She deter∣mined,
if possible, to delay this, till she
heard further from Ludovico, and, if his
designs were found to be impracticable, to
resign the estates at once. Her thoughts
were on this subject, when Montoni, who
was now recovered from the intoxication
of the preceding night, sent for her, and
she immediately obeyed the summons.
He was alone. “I find,” said he, “that
you were not in your chamber, laft night;
where were you?” Emily related to him
some circumstances of her alarm, and
entreated his protection from a repeti∣tion
of them. “You know the terms of
my protection,” said he; “if you really
value this, you will secure it.” His open
declaration, that he would only condition∣ally
protect her, while she remained a pri∣soner
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
in the castle, shewed Emily the ne∣cessity
of an immediate compliance with
his terms; but she first demanded, whe∣ther
he would permit her immediately to
depart, if she gave up her claim to the
contected estates. In a very solemn man∣ner
he then assured her, that he would,
and immediately laid before her a paper,
which was to transfer the right of those estates to himself.</P>
<P>She was, for a considerable time, un∣able
to sign it, and her heart was torn with
contending interests, for she was about to re∣sign
the happiness of all her future years-the
hope, which had sustained her in so
many hours of adversity.</P>
<P>After hearing from Montoni a recapitu∣lation
of the conditions of her compliance,
and a remonstrance, that his time was va∣luable,
she put her hand to the paper;
when she had done which, she fell back in
her chair, but soon recovered, and de∣sired,
that he would give orders for her
departure, and that he would allow An∣nette
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
to accompany her. Montoni smiled.
“It was necessary to deceive you,” said
he, there was no other way of making
you act reasonably; you sshall go, but
it must not be at present. I must first
secure these estates by possession: when
that is done, you may return to France if
you will.”</P>
<P>The deliberate villany, with which he
violated the solemn engagement he had
just entered into, shocked Emily as much,
as the certainty, that she had made a fruit∣less
sacrifice, and must still remain his
prisoner. She had no words to express
what she felt, and knew, that it would
have been useless, if she had. As she
looked piteously at Montoni, he turned
away, and at the same time desired she
would withdraw to her apartment; but,
unable to leave the room, she sat down in
a chair near the door, and sighed heavily.
She had neither words nor tears,</P>
<P>“Why will you indulge this childish
grief?” said he. “Endeavour to strengthen
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
your mind, to bear patiently what cannot
now be avoided; you have no real evil to
lament; be patient, and you will be sent
back to France. At present retire to your
apartment.'</P>
<P>I dare not go, sir,” said she, “where
I shall be liable to the intrusion of Signor Verezzi.”
“Have I not promised to
protect you?” said Montoni, “You have
promised, sir,”-replied Emily, after
some hesitation. “And is not my pro∣mise
sufficient?” added he sternly. “You
will recollect your former promise, Signor,”
said Emily, trembling, “and may de∣termine
for me, whether I ought to rely
upon this.” “Will you provoke me to
declare to you, that I will not protect you
then?” said Montoni, in a tone of haughty
displeasure. “If that will satisfy you, I
will do it immediately. Withdraw to your
Chamber, before I retract my promise;
you have nothing to fear there.” Emily
left the room, and moved slowly into<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the
hall; where the fear of meeting Verezzi,
<PB N="263" REF="265"/>
or Bertolini, made her quicken her steps,
though she could scarcely support herself;
and soon after she reached once more her
own apartment. Having looked fearfully
round her, to examine if any person was
there, and having searched every part of
it, she fastened the door, and sat down by
one of the casements. Here, while she
looked out for some hope to support her
fainting spirits, which had been so long
harassed and oppressed, that, if she had
not now struggled much against misfor∣tune,
they would have left her, perhaps,
for ever, she endeavoured to believe, that
Montoni did really intend to permit her return to
France as soon as he had secured
her property, and that he would, in the
mean time, protect her from insult; but
her chief hope rested with Ludovico, who,
she doubted not, would be zealous in her
cause, though he seemed almost to despair
of success in it. One circumstance, how∣ever,
she had to rejoice in. Her prud∣ence,
or rather her fears, had saved her
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
from mentioning the name of Valancourt
to Montoni, which shhe was several times
on the point of doing, before she signed
the paper, and of stipulating for his re∣lease,
if he should be really a prisoner in
the castle. Had she done this, Montoni's
jealous fears would now probably have
loaded Valancourt with new severities, and
have suggested the advantage of holding
him a captive for life.</P>
<P>Thus passed the melancholy day, as she
had before passed many in this same cham∣ber.
When night drew on, she would
have withdrawn herself to Annette's bed,
had not a particular interest inclined her
to remain in this chamber, in spite of her
fears; for, when the castle should be still,
and the customary hour arrived, she de∣termined
to watch for the music, which
she had formerly heard. Though its
sounds might not enable her positively to
determine, whether Valancourt was there,
they would perhaps strengthen her opi∣nion
that he was, and impart the comfort,
<PB N="265" REF="267"/>
so necessary to her present support.—But,
on the other hand, if all should be silent—!
—She hardly dared to suffer her thoughts
to glance that way, but waited, with im∣patient
expectation, the approaching hour.</P>
<P>The night was stormy; the battlements
of the castle appeared to rock in the wind,
and, at intervals, long groans seemed to
pass on the air, such as those, which often
deceive the melancholy mind, in tempests,
and amids scenes of desolation. Emily
heard, as formerly, the sentinels pass along
the terrace to their posts, and, looking out
from her casement, observed, that the
watch was doubled; a precaution, which
appeared necessary enough, when she threw
her eyes on the walls, and saw their shat∣tered
condition. The well-known sounds of the
soldiers' march, and of their distant
voices, which passed her in the wind, and
were lost again, recalled to her memory
the melancholy sensations she had suffered,
when she formerly heard the same sounds;
and occasioned almost involuntary com∣parisons
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
between her present, and her late
situation. But this was no subject for con∣gratulation,
and she wisely checked the
courfe of her thoughts, while, as the hour
was not yet come, in which she had been
accustomed to hear the rnusic, she closed
the casement, and endeavoured to await it
in patience. The door of the stair-case
she tried to secure, as usual, with some
of the furniture of the room; but this ex∣pedient
her fears now represented to her to
be very inadequate to the power and per∣severance
of Verezzi; and she often looked
at a large and heavy chest, that stood in
the chamber, with wishes that she andAn∣nette
had strength enough to move it.
While she blamed the long stay of this
girl, who was still with Ludovico and some
other of the servants, she trimmed her
wood fire, to make the room appear less
desolate, and sat down beside it with a
book, which her eyes perused, while her
thoughts wandered to Valancourt, and her
own misfortunes. As she sat thus, she
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
thought, in a pause of the wind, she dis∣tinguished
music, and went to the case∣ment
to listen, but the loud swell of the
gust overcame every other sound. When
the wind sunk again, she heard distinctly,
in the deep pause that succeeded, the
sweet strings of a lute; but again the rising
tempest bore away the notes, and again
was succeeded by a solemn pause. Emily,
trembling with hope and fear, opened her
casement to listen, and to try whether her
own voice could be heard by the musician;
for to endure any longer this state of tor∣turing
suspense concerning Valancourt,
seemed to be utterly impossible. There
was a kind of breathless stillness in the
chambers, that permitted her to distinguish
from below the tender notes of the very
lute she had formerly heard, and with it,
a plaintive voice, made sweeter by the low
rustling sound, that now began to creep
along the wood-tops, till it was lost in the
rising wind. Their tall heads then began
to wave, while, through a forest of pine,
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
On the left, the wind, groaning heavily,
rolled onward over the woods below, bend∣ing
them almost to their roots; and, as
the long-resounding gale swept away,
other woods, on the right, feemed to an∣swer
the “loud lament;” then, others,
further still, softened it into a murmur,
that died into silence. Emily listened, with
mingled awe and expectation, hope and
fear; and again the melting sweetness of
the lute was heard, and the same solemn∣breathing
voice. Convinced that these
came from an apartment underneath, she
leaned far out of her window, that she
might discover whether any light was
there; but the casements below, as well
as those above, were sunk so deep in the
thick walls of the castle, that she could
not see them, or even the faint ray, that
probably glimmered through their bars.
She then ventured to call; but the wind
bore her voice to the other end of the
terrace, and then the music was heard as
before, in the pause of the gust. Suddenly,
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
she thought she heard a noise in her cham∣ber,
and she drew herself within the casement;
but, in a moment after, distinguish∣ing
Annette's voice at the door, she con∣cluded
it was her she had heard before,
and she let her in. “Move softly, An∣nette,
to the casement,” said she, “and
listen with me; the music is returned.”
They were silent till, the, measure chang∣ing,
Annette exclaimed, “Holy Virgin!
I know that song well; it is a French
song, one of the savourite songs of my dear
country.” This was the ballad Emily had
heard on a former night, thought not the
one she had first listened to from the fish∣ing-house
in Gascony. “O! it is a
Frenchman, that sings,” said Annette: “it
must be Monsieur Valancourt.” “Hark!
Annette, do not speak so loud,” said
Emily, “we may be overheard,” “What!
by the Chevalier?” said Annette. “No,”
replied Emily mournfully, “but by some∣body,
who may report us to the Signor.
What reason have you to think it is Monsieur
<PB N="270" REF="272"/>
Valancourt, who sings? But hark!
now the voice swells louder! Do you re∣collect
those tones? I fear to trust my
own judgment.” “I never happened to
hear the Chevalier sing, Mademoiselle,”
replied Annette, who, as Emily was disappointed
to perceive, had no stronger
reason for concluding this to be Valan.
court, than that the musician must be a
Frenchman. Soon after, she heard the
song of the fishing-house, and distinguished
her own name, which was repeated so dis∣tinctly,
that Annette had heard it also.
She trembled, sunk, into a chair by the
window, and Annette called aloud, “Mon∣sieur
Valancourt! Monsieur Valancourt”
while Emily endeavoured to check her,
but she repeated the call more loudly than
before, and the lute and the voice sudden∣ly
stopped. Emily listened, for some time,
in a state of intolerable suspense; but, no
answer being returned, “It does not sig∣nify,
mademoiselle,” said Annette; “it is
the Chevalier, and I will speak to him.”
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
“No, Annette,” said Emily, “I think I
will speak myself; if it is he, he will
know my voice, and speak again.” “Who
is it,” said she, “that sings at this late
hour?”</P>
<P>A long silence ensued, and, having re∣peated
the question, she perceived some
faint accents, mingling in the blast, that
swept by; but the sounds were so distant,
and passed so suddenly, that she could
scarcely hear them, much less distinguish
the words they uttered, or recognise the
voice. After another pause, Emily called
again; and again they heard a voice, but
as faintly as before; and they perceived,
that there were other circumstances, be∣sides
the strength, and direction of the
wind, to contend with; for the great depth,
at which the casements were sixed in the
castle walls, contributed, still more than
the distance, to prevent articulated sounds
from being understood, though general
ones were easily heard. Emily, however,
ventured to believe, from the circumstance
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
of her voice alone having been answered,
that the stranger was Valancourt, as well
as that he knew her, and she gave herself
up to speechless joy. Annette, however,
was not speechless.—She renewed her calls,
but received no answer; and Emily,
fearing, that a further attempt, which cer∣tainly
was, at present, highly, dangerous,
might expose them to the guards of the
castle, while it could not perhaps termi∣nate
her suspense, insisted on Annette's
dropping the enquiry for this night; though
she determined herself to question Ludo∣vico,
on the subject, in the morning, more
urgently than she had yet done. She was
now enabled to say, that the stranger,
whom she had formerly heard, was still in
the castle, and to direct Ludovico to that
part of it, in which he was confined.</P>
<P>Emily, attended by Annette, continued
at the casement, for some time; but all re∣mained
still; they heard neither lute or
voice again, and Emily was now as much
oppressed by anxious joy, as she lately
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
was by a sense of her misfortunes. With
hasty steps she paced the room, now half
calling on Valancourt's name, then sud∣denly
stopping, and now going to the
casement and listening, where, however,
she heard nothing but thesolemn waving
of the woods. Sometimes her impatience
to speak to Ludovico prompted her to
send Annette to call him; but a sense
of the impropriety of this at midnight re∣strained
her. Annette, meanwhile, as im∣patient
as her mistress, went as often to
the casement to listen, and returned almost
as much, disappointed. She, at length,
mentioned Signor Verezzi, and her fear,
lest he should enter the chamber by the
stcaircase door. “But the night is now
almost past, mademoiselle.” said she, re∣collecting
herself: “there is the morning
light, beginning to peep over those moun∣tains
yonder in the east.”</P>
<P>Emily had forgotten, till this moment,
that such a person existed as Verezzi, and
all the danger that had appeared to threaten
<PB N="274" REF="276"/>
her; but the mention of his name renewed
her alarm, and she remembered the old
chest, that she had wished to place against
the door, which she now, with Annette,
attempted to move, but it was so heavy,
that they could not lift it from the floor,
“What is in this great old chest, made∣moiselle,”
said Annette, “that makes it
so weighty?” Emily having replied, “that
she found it in the chamber, when she first
came to the castle, and had never examined
it,”—“Then I will, ma'amselle,” said
Annette, and she tried to lift the lid; but
this was held by a lock, for which she had
no key, and which, indeed, appeared, from
its peculiar construction, to open with a
spring. The morning now glimmered
through the casements, and the wind had
sunk into a calm. Emily looked out upon
the dusky woods, and on the twilight
mountains, just stealing on the eye, and
saw the whole scene, after the storm, lying
in profound stillness, the woods motion∣ess,
and the clouds above, through which
<PB N="275" REF="277"/>
the dawn trembled, scarcely appearing to
move along the heavens. One soldier was
pacing the terrace beneath, with measured
steps; and two, more distant, were sunk
asleep on the walls, wearied with the
night's watch. Having inhaled, for a
while, the pure spirit of the air, and of
vegetation, which the late rains had called
forth; and having listened, once more,
for a note of music, she now closed the
casement, and retired to rest.</P>

<P>SEVERAL of her succeeding days passed
in suspense, for Ludovico could only learn
from the soldiers, that there was a prisoner
in the apartment, described to him by
Emily, and that he was a Frenchman,
whom they had taken in one of their skir∣mishes,
with a party of his countrymen.
During this interval, Emily escaped the
persecutions of Bertolini, and Verezizi, by
confining herself to her apartment; except
that something, in an evening, she ven∣tured
<PB N="277" REF="279"/>
to walk, in the adjoining corridor.
Montoni appeared to respect his last pro∣mise,
though he had prophaned his first;
for to his protection only could she attri∣bute
her present repose; and in this she
was now so secure, that she did not wish to
leave the castle, till she could obtain some
certainty concerning Valancourt; for which
she waited, indeed, without any sacrifice of
her own comfort, since no circumstance
had occurred to make her escape pro∣bable.</P>
<P>On the fourth day, Ludovico informed
her, that he had hopes of being admitted to
the presence of the prisoner; it being the
turn of a soldier, with whom he had been
for some time familiar, to attend him on
the following night. He was not deceived
in his hope; for, under pretence of car∣rying
in a pitcher of water, he entered the
prison, though, his prudence having pre∣vented
him from telling the sentinel the
real motive of his visit, he was obliged to
<PB N="278" REF="280"/>
make his conference with the prisoner a
very short One.</P>
<P>Emily awaited the result in her own
apartment, Ludovico having promised to
accompany Annette to the corridor, in the
evening; where, after several hours impa∣tiently
counted, he arrived. Emily, having
then uttered the name of Valancourt, could
articulate no more, but hesitated in trem∣bling
expectation. “The Chevalier would
not entrust me with his name, Signora,”
replied Ludovico; “but, when I just
mentioned yours, he seemed overwhelmed
with joy, though he was not so much sur∣prised
as I expected.” “Does he then
remember me?” she exclaimed.</P>
<P>“O! it is Mons Valancourt,” said Annette,
and looked impatiently at Ludovico, who
understood her look, and replied to Emily:
“Yes, lady, the Chevalier does, indeed, re∣member
you, and, I am sure, has a very
great regard for you, and I made bold to
say you had for him. He then enquired
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
how you came to know he was in the castle,
and whether you ordered me to speak to him.
The first question 1 could not answer, but
the second I did; and then he went off into
his ecstasies again. I was afraid his joy
would have betrayed him to the sentinel
at the door.”</P>
<P>“But how does he look, Luclovico?” in∣terrupted
Emily:” is he not melancholy
and ill with this long confinement?”—
“Why, as to melancholy, I saw no symp∣tom
of that, lady, while I was with him,
for he seemed in the finest spirits I ever
saw any body in, in all my life. His
countenance was all joy, and, if one may
judge from that, he was very-well; but
I did not ask him.” “Did he send me
no message?” said Emily. “O yes, Sig∣nora,
and something besides,” replied Lu∣dovico,
who searched his pockets. “Sure∣ly,
I have not lost it,” added he. “The
Chevalier said, he would have written, ma∣dam,
if he had had pen and ink; and was
going to have sent a very long message,
<PB N="280" REF="282"/>
when the sentinel entered the room, but
not before he had given me this.” Lu∣dovico
then drew forth a miniature from
his bosom, which Emily received with a
trembling hand, and perceived to be a
portrait of herself—the very picture, which
her mother had lost so strangely in the
fishing-house at La Vall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>Tears of mingled joy and tenderness
flowed to her eyes, while Ludovico pro∣ceeded—“Tell
your lady, said the
Chevalier, as he gave me the picture, that
this has been my companion, and only so∣lace
in all my misfortunes. Tell her, that
I have worn it next my heart, and that I
send it her as the pledge of an affection,
which can never die; that I would not
part with it, but to her, for the wealth of
worlds, and that I now part with it, only
in the hope of soon receiving it from her
hands. Tell her'—Just then, Signora,
the sentinel came in, and the Chevalier
said no more; but he had before asked
me to contrive an interview for him with
<PB N="281" REF="283"/>
you; and when I told him, how little hope
I had of prevailing with the guard to assist
me, he said, that was not, perhaps, of
so much consequence as I imagined, and
bade me contrive to bring back your an∣swer,
and he would inform me of more
than he chose to do then. So this, I think,
lady, is the whole of what passed.”</P>
<P>“How, Ludovico, shall I reward you
for your zeal' “said Emily:” but, in∣deed,
I do not now possess the means.
When can you see the Chevalier again?”
“That is uncertain, Signora,” replied he.
“It depends upon who stands guard next:
there are not more than one or two among
them, from whom I would dare to ask ad∣mittance
to the prison-chamber.”</P>
<P>“I need not bid you remember, Lu∣dovico,”
resumed Emily, “how very
much interested I am in your seeing the
Chevalier soon; and, when you do so, tell
him, that I have received the picture, and,
with the sentiments he wished. Tell him
I have suffered much, and still fuffer”—
<PB N="282" REF="284"/>
She paused. “But shall I tell him you
will see him, lady?” said Ludovico.
“Most certainly I will,” replied Emily.
“But when, Signora, and where?” “That
must depend upon circumstances,” return∣ed
Emily. “The place, and the hour,
must be regulated<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by his opportunities.”</P>
<P>“As to the place, mademoiselle,” said
Annette, “there is no other place in the
castle, besides this corridor, where <HI>we</HI> can
see him in safety, you know; and, as for
the hour,—it must be when all the Signors
are asleep, if that ever happens!” “You
may mention these circumstances to the
Chevalier, Ludovico,” said she, checking
the flippancy of Annette, “and leave them
to his judgment and opportunity. Tell
him, my heart is unchanged. But, above
all, let him see you again as soon as pos∣sible; and, Ludovico, 1 think it is need∣less
to tell you 1 shall very anxiously look
for you.” Having then wished her good
night, Ludovico descended the staircase,
and Emily retired to rest, but not to sleep,
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
for joy now rendered her as wakeful, as she
had ever been from grief. Montoni and
his castle had all vanished from her mind,
like the frightful vision of a necromancer,
and she wandered, once more, in fairy
scenes of unfading happiness:
<Q><L>—“As when, beneath the beam</L>
<L>Of summer moons, the distant woods among,</L>
<L>Or by some flood, all silver'd with the gleam,</L>
<L>The soft embodied Fay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thro' airy portals stream,”</L></Q></P>
<P>A week elapsed, before Ludovico again
visited the prison; for the sentinels, during
that period, were men, in whom he could
not confide, and he feared to awaken cu∣riosity,
by asking to see their prisoner. In
this interval, he communicated to Emily
terrific reports of what was passing in the
castle; of riots, quarrels, and of carousals
more alarming than either; while from
some circumstances, which he mentioned,
she not only doubted, whether Montoni
meant ever to release her, but greatly
feared, that he had designs, concerning
<PB N="284" REF="286"/>
her,—such as she had formerly dreaded.
Her name was frequently mentioned in the
conversations, which Bertolini and Verezzi
held together, and, at those times, they
were frequently in contention. Montoni
had lost large sums to Verezzi, so that
there was a dreadful possibility of his designing
her to be a substitute for the debt;
but, as she was ignorant, that he had for∣merly
encouraged the hopes of Bertolini
also, concerning herself, after the latter
had done him some signal service, she knew
not how to account for these contentions
between Bertolini and Verezzi. The cause
of them, however, appeared to be of little
consequence, for she thought she saw de∣struction
approaching; in many forms, and
her entreaties to Ludovico to contrive an
Escape and to see the prisoner again, were
more urgent than ever.</P>
<P>At length, he informed her, that he had
again visi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the Chevalier, who had di∣rected
him to confide in the guard of the
prison, from whom he had already re∣ceived
<PB N="285" REF="287"/>
some instances of kindness, and
who had promised to permit his going into
the castle for half an hour, on the en∣suing
night, when Montoni and his com∣panions
should be engaged at their carou∣sals.
“This was kind, to be sure,” added
Ludovico: “but Sebastian knows he runs
no risque in letting the Chevalier out, for,
if he can get beyond the bars and iron
doors of the castle, he must be cunning
indeed. But the Chevalier desired me,
Signora, to go to you immediately, and
to beg you would allow him to visit you,
this night, if it was only for a moment,
for that he could no longer live under the
same roof, without seeing you; the hour,
he sald, he could not mention, for it must
depend on circumstances (just as you said,
Signora); and the place he desired you
would appoint, as knowing which was best
for your own safety.”</P>
<P>Emily was now so much agitated by the
near prospect of meeting Valancourt, that
it was some time, before she could give
<PB N="286" REF="288"/>
any answer to Ludovico, or consider of the
place of meeting; when she did, she saw
none, that promised so much security, as
the corridor, near her own apartment,
which she was checked from leaving, by
the apprehension of meeting any of Mon∣toni's
guests, on their way to their rooms;
and she dismissed the scruples, which deli∣cacy
opposed, now that a serious danger
was to be avoided by encountering them.
It was settled, therefore, that the Cheva∣lier
should meet her in the corridor, at
that hour of the night, which Ludovico,
who was to be upon the watch, should
judge safest: and Emily, as may be ima∣gined,
passed this interval in a tumult of
hope and joy, anxiety and impatience.
Never, since her residence in the castle,
had she watched, with so much pleasure,
the sun set behind the mountains, and twilight
shade, and darkness veil the sccne,
as on this evening. She counted the notes
of the great clock, and listened to the steps
of the sentinels, as they changed the watch,
<PB N="287" REF="289"/>
only to rejoice, that another hour was gone.
“O, Valancourt!” said she, “after all I
have suffered; after our long, long sepa∣ration,
when I thought I should never—
never see you more—we are still to meet
again! O! I have endured grief, and
anxiety, and terror, and let me, then, not
sink beneath this joy!” These were mo∣ments,
when it was impossible for her to
feel emotions of regret, or melancholy, for
any ordinary interests;—even the reflec∣tion,
that she had resigned the estates, which
would have been a provision for herself
and Valancourt for life, threw only a light
and transient shade upon her spirits. The
idea of Valancourt, and that she should see
him so soon, alone occupied her heart.</P>
<P>At length the clock struck twelve; she
opened the door to listen, if any noise was
in the castle, and heard only distant shouts
of riot and laughter, echoed feebly along
the gallery. She guessed, that the Signor
and his guests were at the banquet. “They
are now engaged for the night,” said she
<PB N="288" REF="290"/>
and Valancourt will soon be here.”
Having softly closed the door, she paced
the room with impatient steps, and often
went to the casement to listen for the lute;
but all was silent, and, her agitation every
moment increasing, she was at length
unable to support herself, and sat down
by the window. Annette, whom she de∣tained,
was, in the meantime, as loquacious
as usual; but Emily heard scarcely any
thing she said, and having at length risen to
the casement, she distinguished the chords
of the lute, struck with an expressive hand,
and then the voice, she had formerly listened
to, accompanied it.
<Q><L>“Now rising love they fann'd, now pleasing dole</L>
<L>They breath'd in tender musings through the heart;</L>
<L>And now a graver, sacred strain they stole,</L>
<L>As when seraphic hands an hymn impart!”</L></Q></P>
<P>Emily wept in doubtful joy and tender∣ness;
and, when the strain ceased she con∣sidered
it as a signal, that Valancourt was
about to leave the prison. Soon after, she
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
heard steps in the corridor;—they were
the light, quick steps of hope; she could
scarcely support herself, as they approach∣ed,
but opening the door of the apart∣ment,
she advanced to meet Valancourt,
and, in the next moment, sunk in the
arms of astranger. His voice—his coun∣tenance
instantly convinced her, and she
fainted away.</P>
<P>On reviving, she found herself support∣ed
by the stranger, who was watching over
her recovery, with a countenance of inef∣fable
tenderness and anxiety. She had no
spirits for reply, or enquiry; she asked no
questions, but burst into tears, and disengaged
herfelf from his arms; when the ex∣pression
of his countenance changed to sur∣prise
and disappointment, and he turned
to Ludovico, for an explanation; Annette
soon gave the information, which Ludo∣vico
could not. “O, sir!” said she, in a
voice, interrupted with sobs; “O, sir!
you are not the other Chevalier. We ex∣pccted
Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieur Valancourt, but you are
<PB N="290" REF="292"/>
not he! O Ludovico! how could you de∣ceive
us so? my poor lady will never re∣cover
it—never!” The stranger, who now
appeared much agitated, attempted to
speak, but his words faltered; and then
striking his hand against his forehead, as
if in sudden despair, he walked abruptly
to the other end of the corridor.</P>
<P>Suddenly, Annette dried her tears, and
spoke to Ludovico. “But, perhaps,”
said she, “after all, the other Chevalier is
not this: perhaps the Chevalier Valan∣court
is still below.” Emily raised her
head. “No,” replied Ludovico, “Mon∣sieur
Valancourt never was below, if this
gentleman is not he.” “If you, sir,”
said Ludovico, addressing the stranger,
would but have had the goodness to trust
me with your name, this mistake had been
avoided.” “Most true,” replied the stran∣ger,
speaking in broken Italian, “but
it was of the utmost consequence to me,
that my name should be concealed from
Montoni. Madam,” added he then, addressing
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
Emily in French, “will you per∣mit
me to apologize for the pain I have
occasioned you, and to explain to you
alone my name, and the circumstance,
which has led me into this error? I am of
France;—I am your countryman;—we
are met in a foreign land.” Emily tried
to compose her spirits; yet she hesitated to
grant his request. At length, desiring,
that Ludovico would wait on the stair-case,
and detaining Annette, she told the
stranger, that her woman understood very
little Italian, and begged he would
com∣municate
what he wished to say, in that
language.—Having withdrawn to a distant
part of the corridor, he said, with a long∣drawn
sigh, “You, madam, are no stranger
to me, though I am so unhappy as to be
unknown to you.—My name is Du Pont;
I am of France, of Gascony, your native
province, and have long admired,—and,
why should I affect to disguise it?—have
long loved you.” He paused, but, in the
next moment, proceeded. “My family,
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
madam, is probably not unknown to you,
for we lived within a few miles of L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Vall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and I have, sometimes, had the
happiness of meeting you, on visits in
the neighbourhood. I will not offend you
by repeating how much you interested me;
how much I loved to wander in the scenes
you frequented; how often I visited your
favourite fishing-house, and lamented the
circumstance, which, at that time, for∣bade
me to reveal my passion. I will not
explain how I surrendered to temptation,
and became possessed of a treasure, which
was to me inestimable; a treasure, which
I committed to your messenger, a few days
ago, with expectations very different from
my present ones. I will say nothing of
these circumstances, for I know they will
avail me little; let me only supplicate from
you forgiveness, and the picture, which I
so unwarily returned. Your generosity
will pardon the theft, and restore the
prize. My crime has been my punish∣ment;
for the portrait I stole has contri∣buted
<PB N="293" REF="295"/>
to nourish a passion, which must still
be my torment.”</P>
<P>Emily now interrupted him. “I think,
sir, I may leave it to your integrity to de∣termine,
whether, after what has just ap∣peared,
concerning mons. Valancourt, I
ought to return the picture. I think you
will acknowledge, that this would not be
generosity; and you will allow me to add,
that it would be doing myself an injustice.
I must consider myself honoured by your
good opinion, but—and she hesitated,
—“the mistake of this evening makes it
unnecessary for me to say more.”</P>
<P>“It does, madam,—alas! it does!”
said the stranger, who, after a long pause,
proceeded.—“But you will allow me to
shew my disinterestedness, though not my
love, and will accept the services I offer.
Yet, alas <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what services can. I offer? I am
myfelf a prisoner, a sufferer, like you. But,
dear as liberty is to me, I would not seek
it through half the hazards I would en∣counter
to deliver you from this recess of
<PB N="294" REF="296"/>
vice. Accept the offered servlces of a
friend; do not refuse me the reward of
having, at lea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, attempted to deserve your
thanks.”</P>
<P>“You deserve them already, sir,” said
Emily; “the wish deserves my warmest
thanks. But you will excuse me for re∣minding
you of the danger you incur by
prolonging this interview. It will be a
great consolation to me to remember, whe∣ther
your friendly attempts to release me
succeed or not, that 1 have a countryman,
who would so generously protect me.”—
Monsieur Du Pont took her hand, which
she but feebly attempted to withdraw, and
pressed it respectfully to his lips. “Al∣low
me to breathe another servent sigh for
your happiness,” said he, “and to ap∣plaud
myself for an affection, which 1 can∣not
conquer.” As he said this, Emily
heard a noise from her apartment, and,
turning round, saw the door from the stair-case
open, and a man rush into her cham∣ber,
“I will teach you to conquer it,”
<PB N="295" REF="297"/>
cried he, as he advanced into the corridor,
and drew a stiletco, which he aimed at
Do Pont, who was unarmed, but who,
stepping back, avoided the blow, and
then sprung upon Verezzi, from whom
he wrenched the stiletto. While they
struggled in each other's grasp, Emily,
followed by Annette, ran further into the
corridor, calling on Ludovico, who was,
however, gone from the stair-case, and, as
she advanced, terrified and uncertain what
to do, a distant noise, that seemed to arise
from the hall, reminded her of the danger
she was incurring; and, sending Annette
forward in search of Ludovico, she re∣turned
to the spot where Du Pont and
Verezzi were still struggling for victory.
It was her own cause which was to be
decided with that of the former, whose
conduct, independently of this circumstance,
would, however, have interested her in his
success, even had she not disliked and
dreaded Verezzi. She threw herself in a
chair, and supplicated them to desist from
<PB N="296" REF="298"/>
further violence, till, at length, Du Pont
forced Verezzi to the floor, where he lay
stunned by the violence of his fall; and
she then entreated Du Pont to escape from
the room, before Montoni, or his party,
sbould appear; but he still refused to leave
her unprotected; and, while Emily, now
more terrified for him, than for herself,
enforced the entreaty, they heard steps
ascending the private stair-case.</P>
<P>“O you ard lost!” cried she, “these
are Montoni's people.” Du Pont made
no reply, but supported Emily, while, with
a steady, though eager, countenance, he
awaited their appearance, and, in the next
moment, Ludovico, alone, mounted the
landing-place. Throwing an hasty glance
round the chamber, “Follow me,” said
he, “as you value your lives; we have
not an instant to lose!”</P>
<P>Emily enquired what had occurred, and
whither they were to go?</P>
<P>“I cannot stay to tell you now, Sig∣nora;”
replied Ludovico: “fly! fly!”
<PB N="297" REF="299"/>
She immediately followed him, accom∣panied
by Mons Du Pont, down the stair-case,
and along a vaulted passage, when
suddenly she recollected Annette, and en∣quired
for her. “She awaits us further
on, Signora,” faid Ludovico, almost
breathless with haste; “the gates were
open, a moment since, to a party just come
in from the mountains: they will be shut,
I fear, before we can reach them! Through
this door, Signora,” added Ludovico, hold∣ing
down the lamp, “take care, here are
two steps.”</P>
<P>Emily followed, trembling still more, than
before she had understood, that her escape
from the castle depended upon the present
moment; while Du Pont supported her,
and endeavoured, as they passed along, to
cheer her spirits.</P>
<P>“Speak low, Signor,” said Ludovico,
these passages send echoes all round the
castle.”</P>
<P>“Take care of the light, cried Emily,
<PB N="298" REF="300"/>
you go so fast, that the air will extin∣guish
it.”</P>
<P>Ludovico now opened another door,
where they found Annette, and the party
then descended a short flight of steps into
a passage, which, Ludovico said, led round
the inner court of the castle, and opened
into the outer one. As they advanced,
confused and tumultuous sounds, that
seemed to come from the inner court,
alarmed Emily. “Nay, Signora,” said
Ludovico, “our only hope is in that tu∣mult;
while the Signer's people are busied
about the men, who are just arrived, we
may, perhaps, pass unnoticed through the
gates. But hush!” he added, as they
approached the small door, that opened
into the outer court, “if you will remain
here a moment, I will go to see whether the
gates are open, and any body is in the way.
Pray extinguish the light, Signor, if you
hear me talking,” continued Ludovico,
delivering the lamp to Du Pont,” and
remain quite still.”</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="301"/>
Saying this, he stepped out upon the
court, and they closed the door, listening
anxiously to his departing steps. No voice,
however, was heard in the court, which he
was crossing, though a confusion. of many
voices yet issued from the inner one. “We
shall soon be beyond the walls,“said Du
Pont sostly to Emily, “support yourself
a little longer, Madam, and all will be
well.”</P>
<P>But soon they heard Ludovico speak∣ing;
loud, and the voice also of some other
person, and Du Pont immediately extin∣guished
the lamp. “Ah! it is too late!”
exclaimed Emily, “what is to become of
us?' They listened again, and then per∣ceived,
that Ludovico was talking with a
sentinel, whose voices were heard also by
Emily's favourite dog, that had followed
her from the chamber, and now barked
loudly. “This dog will betray us!”said
Du Pont, “I will hold him.““I fear
he has already betrayed us!”replied
Emily. Du Pont, however, caught him
<PB N="300" REF="302"/>
up, and, again listening to what was going
on without, they heard Ludovico say,
“I'll watch the gates the while.”</P>
<P>“Stay a minute,”replied the sentinel,
“and you need not have the trouble, for
the horses will be sent round to the outer
stables, then the gates will be shut, and I
can leave my post.”“I don't mind the
trouble, comrade.“said Ludovico, “you
will do such another good turn for me,
some time. Go—go, and fetch the wine;
the rogues, that are just come in, will
drink it all else.”</P>
<P>The soldier hesitated, and then called
aloud to the people in the second court, to
know why they did not send out the
horses, that the gates might be shut; but
they were too much engaged, to attend to
him, even if they had heard his voice.</P>
<P>“Aye—aye,” said Ludovico, “they
know better than that; they are sharing it
all among them; if you wait till the horses
come out, you must wait till the wine is
drunk. I have had my share already, but,
<PB N="301" REF="303"/>
since you do not care about yours, I see
no reason why I should not have that too.”</P>
<P>“Hold, hold, not so fast,”cried the
sentinel, “do watch then, for a moment; I'll be with you presently.”</P>
<P>“Don't hurry yourself,”said Ludovico,
coolly, “I have kept guard before now.
But you may leave me your<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A kind of blunderbufs.</NOTE> trombone,
that, if the castle should be attacked, you
know, I may be able to defend the pass
like a hero.”</P>
<P>“There, my good fellow,”returned the
soldier, “there, take it—it has seen ser∣vice,
though it could do little in defend∣ing
the castle. I'll tell you a good story,
though, about this same trombone.”</P>
<P>“You'll tell it better when you have
had the wine,”said Ludovico. “There!
they are coming out from the court al∣ready.”</P>
<P>“I'll have the wine, though,”said the
sentinel, running off. “I won't keep you
a minute.”</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="304"/>
“Take your time, I am in no haste,”
replied Ludovico, who was already hurry∣ing
across the court, when the soldier came
back. “Whither so fast, friend—whither
so fast?”said the latter. “What! is this
the way you keep watch? I must stand to
my post myself, I see.”</P>
<P>“Aye, well,”replied Ludovico, “you
have saved me the trouble of following
you further, for I wanted to tell you, if
you have a mind to drink the Tuscany
wine, you must go to Seba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tian, he is deal∣ing
it out; the other that Federico has, is
not worth having. But you are not likely
to have any, I see, for they are all coming
out.”</P>
<P>“By St. Peter! so they are,”said the
soldier, and again ran off, while Ludo∣vico,
once more at liberty, hastened to the
door of the passage, where Emily was sink∣ing
under the anxiety this long discourse
had occasioned; but, on his telling them
the court was clear, they followed him to
the gates, without waiting another instant,
<PB N="303" REF="305"/>
yet not before he had seized two horses,
that had strayed from the second court,
and were picking a scanty meal among the
grass, which grew between the pavement
of the first.</P>
<P>They passed, without interruption, the
dreadful gates, and took the road that led
down among the woods, Emily, Monsieur
Du Pont and Annette on foot, and Lu∣dovico,
who was mounted on one horse,
leading the other. Having reached them,
they stopped, while Emily and Annette
were placed on horseback with their two
protectors, when, Ludovico leading the
way, they set off as fast as the broken road,
and the feeble light, which a rising moon
threw among the foliage, would permit.</P>
<P>Emily was so much astonished by this
sudden departure, that she scarcely dared
to believe herself awake; and she yet much
doubted whether this adventure would ter∣minate
in escape,—a doubt, which had too
much probability to justify it; for, before
they quitted the woods, they heard shouts
<PB N="304" REF="306"/>
in the wind, and, on emerging from them,
saw lights moving quickly near the castle
above. Du Pont whipped his horse, and
with some difficulty compelled him to go
faster.</P>
<P>“Ah! poor beast,”said Ludovico, “he
is weary enough;—he has been out all
day; but, Signor, we must fly for it, now;
for yonder are the lights coming this way.”</P>
<P>Having given his own horse a lash,
they now both set off on a full gallop; and,
when they again looked back, the lights
were so distant as scarcely to be discerned,
and the voices were sunk into silence. The
travellers then abated their pace, and, con∣sulting
whither they should direct their
course, it was determined they should de∣scend into Tuscany, and endeavour to
reach the Mediterranean, where they could
readily embark for France. Thither Du
Pont meant to attend Emily, if he should
learn, that the regiment he had accom∣panied
into Italy, was returned to his na∣tive
country.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="307"/>
They were now in the road, which Emily
had travelled with Ugo and Bertrand;
but Ludovico, who was the only one of
the party, acquainted with the passes of
these mountains, said, that, a little further
on, a bye-road, branching from this, would
lead them down into Tuscany with very
little difficulty; and that, at a few leagues
distance, was a small town, where necessa∣ries
could be procured for their journey.</P>
<P>“But, I hope,”added he,“we shall
meet with no straggling parties of banditti;
some of them are abroad, I know. How∣ever,
I have got a good trombone, which
will be of some service, if we should en∣counter
any of those brave spirits. You
have no arms, Signor?“”Yes,”replied
Du Pont, “I have the villain's stiletto,
who would have stabbed me—but let us
rejoice in our escape from Udolpho, nor
torment ourselves with looking out for
dangers, that may neve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arrive.”</P>
<P>The moon was now risen high over the
woods, that hung upon the sides of the
<PB N="306" REF="308"/>
narrow glen, through which they wander∣ed,
and afforded them light sufficient to dis∣tinguish
their way, and to avoid the loose
and broken stones, that frequently crossed
it. They now travelled leisurely, and in
prosound silence; for they had scarcely yet
recovered from the astonishment, into which
this suddcn escape had thrown them.—
Emily's rnind, especially, was sunk, after
the various emotions it had suffered, into a
kind of musing stillness, which the repos∣ing
beauty of the surrounding scene and
the creeping murmur of the night-breeze
among the foliage above contributed to
prolong. She thought of Valancourt and
of France, with hope, and she would have
thought of them with joy, had not the first
events of this evening harassed her spirits
too much, to permit her now to feel so
lively a sensation. Meanwhile, Emily was
alone the object of Du Pont's melancholy
consideration; yet, with the despondency
he suffered, as he rnused on his recent dis∣appointment,
was mingled a sweet plea∣sure,
<PB N="307" REF="309"/>
occasioned by her presence, though
they did not now exchange a single word.
Annette thought of this wonderful escape,
of the bustle in which Montoni and his
people must be, now that their slight was
discovered; of her native country, whither
she hoped she was returning, and of her
marriage with Ludovico, to which there
no longer appeared any impediment, for
poverty she did not consider such. Ludo∣vico,
on his part, congratulated himself,
on having rescued his Annette and <HI>Signor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Emily from the danger, that had surround∣ed
them; on his own liberation from peo∣ple,
whose manners he had long detested;
on the freedom he had given to Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sieur
Du Pont; on his prospect of happiness
with the object of his affections, and not a
little on the address, with which he had de∣ceived
the sentinel, and conducted the
whole of this affair.</P>
<P>Thus variously engaged in thought, the
travellers passed on silently, for above an
hour, a question only being, now and then,
<PB N="308" REF="310"/>
asked by Du Pont, concerning the road,
or a remark uttered by Annette, respect∣ing
objects, seen imperfectly in the twi∣light.
At length, lights were perceived
twinkling on the side of a mountain, and
Ludovico had no doubt, that they pro∣ceeded
from the town he had mentioned,
while his companions, satisfied by this
assurance, sunk again into silence. Annette
was the first who interrupted this. “Holy
Peter!”said she, “What shall we do
for money on our journey? for I know
neither I, or my lady, have a single sequin;
the Signor took care of that!”</P>
<P>This remark produced a serious enquiry,
which ended in as serious an embarrass∣ment,
for Du Pont had been rifled of
nearly all his money, when he was taken
prisoner; the remainder he had given to
the sentinel, who had enabled him occa∣sionally
to leave his prison-chamber;
and Ludovico, who had for some time found
a difficulty, in procuring any part of the
wages due to him, had now scarcely cash
<PB N="309" REF="311"/>
sufficient to procure necessary refreshment
at the first town, in which they should ar∣rive.</P>
<P>Their poverty was the more distressing,
since it would detain them among the
mountains, where, even in a town, they
could scarcely consider themselves safe
from Montoni. The travellers, however,
had only to proceed and dare the future;
and they continued their way through
lonely wilds and dusky vallies, where the
overhanging foliage now admitted, and
then excluded the moon-light;—wilds so
desolate, that they appeared, on the first
glance, as if no human being had ever trode
them before. Even the road, in which the
party were, did but slightly contradict this
error, for the high grass and other luxu∣riant
vegetation, with which it was over∣grown,
told how very seldom the foot of a
traveller had passed it.</P>
<P>At length, from a distance, was heard
the faint tinkling of a sheep-bell; and,
soon after, the bleat of flocks, and the party
<PB N="310" REF="312"/>
then knew, that they were near some human
habitation, for the light, which Ludovico
had fancied to proceed from a town, had
long been concealed by intervening moun∣tains.
Cheered by this hope, they quickened
their pace along the narrow pass they were
winding, and it opened upon one of those
pastoral vallies of the Apennines, which
might be painted for a scene of Arcadia,
and whose beauty and simplicity are finely
contrasted by the grandeur of the snow-topt mountains above.</P>
<P>The morning light, now glimmering in
the horizon, shewed faintly, at a little dis∣tance,
upon the brow of a hill, which
seemed to peep from “under the opening
eye-lids of the morn,”the town they were
in search of, and which they soon after
reached. It was not without some diffi∣culty,
that they there found a house,
which could afford shelter for themselves
and their horses; and Emily desired they
might not rest longer than was nccessary
for refreshment. Her appearance excited
<PB N="311" REF="313"/>
some surprise; for she was without a hat,
having had time only to throw on her veil
before she left the castle, a circumstance,
that compelled her to regret again the want
of money, without which it was impossible
to procure this necessary article of dress.</P>
<P>Ludovico, on examining his purse, found
it even insufficient to supply present re∣freshment,
and Du Pont, at length, ven∣tured
to inform the landlord, whose coun∣tenance
was simple and honest, of their ex∣act
situation, and requested, that he would
assist them to pursue their journey; a pur∣pose,
which he promised to comply with,
as far as he was able, when he learned that
they were prisoners escaping from Montoni,
whom he had too much reason to hate.
But, though he consented to lend them fresh
horses to carry them to the next town, he
was too poor himself to trust them with
money, and they were again lamenting
their poverty, when Ludovico, who had
been with his tired horses to the hovel,
which served for a stable, entered the
<PB N="312" REF="314"/>
room, half frantic with joy, in which his
auditors soon participated. On removing
the saddle from one of the horses, he had
found beneath it a small bag, containing,
no doubt, the booty of one of the <HI>condot∣tieri,</HI>
who had returned from a plundering
excursion, just before Ludovico left the
castle, and whose horse having strayed
from the inner court, while his master was
engaged in drinking, had brought away
the treasure, which the ruffian had con∣sidered
the reward of his exploit.</P>
<P>On counting over this, Du Pont found,
that it would be more than sufficient to
carry them all to France, where he now
determined to accompany Emily,
whether he should obtain intelligence of his regi∣ment,
or not; for, though he had as
much confidence in the integrity of Ludo∣vico,
as his small knowledge of him al∣lowed,
he could not endure the thought
of committing her to his care for the voy∣age;
nor, perhaps, had he resolution
enough to deny himself the dangerous
<PB N="313" REF="315"/>
pleasure, which he might derive from her
presence</P>
<P>He now consulted them, concerning the
sea-port, to which they should direct their
way, and Ludovico, better informed of the
geography of the country, said, that Leg∣horn
was the nearest port of consequence,
which Du Pont knew also to be the most
likely of any in Italy to assist their plan,
since from thence vessels of all nations
were continually departing. Thither, there∣fore,
it was determined, that they should
proceed.</P>
<P>Emily, having purchased a little straw
hat, such as was worn by the peasant
girls of Tuscany, and some other little
necessary equipments for the journey, and
the travellers, having exchanged their tired
horses for others better able to carry them,
re-commenced their joyous way, as the
sun was rising over the mountains, and,
after travelling through this romantic coun∣try,
for several hours, began to descend
into the vale of Arno. And here Emily
<PB N="314" REF="316"/>
beheld all the charms of sylvan and pasto∣ral
landscape united, adorned with the ele∣gant
villas of the Florentine nobles, and
diversified. with the various riches of cul∣tivation.
How vivid the shrubs, that em∣bowered
the slopes, with the woods, that
stretched amphitheatrically along the moun∣tains!
and, above all, how elegant the out∣line
of these waving Apennines, now soft∣ening
from the wildness, which their interior
regions exhibited! At a distance, in the east,
Emily discovered Florence, with its towers
rising on the brilliant horizon, and its lux∣uriant
plain, spreading to the feet of the
Apennines, speckled with gardens and magnificent
villas, or coloured with groves
of orange and lemon, with vines, corn,
and plantations of olives and mulberry;
while, to the west, the vale opened to the
waters of the Mediterranean, so distant,
that they were known only by a blueish
line, that appeared upon the horizon, and
by the light marine vapour, which just
stained the aether above.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="317"/>
With a full heart, Emily hailed the
waves, that were to bear her back to her
native country, the remembrance of which,
however, brought with It a pang; for
she had there no home to receive, no pa∣rents
to welcome her, but was going, like
a forlorn pilgrim, to weep over the sad
spot, where he, who <HI>was</HI> her father, lay
interred. Nor were her spirits cheered,
when she considered how long It would
probably be before she should see Valan∣court,
who might be stationed with his re∣giment
in a distant part of France, and that,
when they did meet, it would be
only to lament the successful villany of
Montoni; yet, still she would have felt in
expressible delight at the thought of being
once more in the same country with Valan∣court,
had it even been certain, that she
could not see him.</P>
<P>The intense heat, for it was now noon,
obliged the travellers to look out for a
shady recess, where they might rest, for a
few hours, and the neighbouring thickets,
<PB N="316" REF="318"/>
abounding with wild grapes, raspberries,
and figs, promised them grateful refresh∣ment.
Soon after, they turned from the
road into a grove, whose thick foliage
entirely excluded the sun-beams, and
where a spring, gushing from the rock,
gave coolness to the air; and, having
alighted and turned the horses to graze,
Annette and Ludovico ran to gather fruit
from the surrounding thickets, of which
they soon returned with an abundance. The
travellers, seated under the shade of a pine
and cypress grove and on turf, enriched
with such a profusion of fragrant flowers,
as Emily had scarcely ever seen, even
among the Pyreneacute;es, took their simple
repast, and viewed, with new delight,
beneath the dark umbrage of gigantic
pines, the glowing landscape stretching
to the sea.</P>
<P>Emily and Du Pont gradually became
thoughtful and silent; but Annette was all
joy and loquacity, aud Ludovico was gay,
without forgetting the respectful distance,
<PB N="317" REF="319"/>
which was due to his companions. The
repast being over, Du Pont recommend∣ed
Emily to endeavour to sleep, during
these sultry hours, and, desiring the ser∣vants
would do the same, said he would
watch the while; but Ludovico wished
to spare him this trouble; and Emily
and Annette, wearied with travelling, tried
to repose, while he stood guard with his
trombone.</P>
<P>When Emily refreshed by slumber,
awoke, she found, the sentinel asleep on
his post and Du Pont awake, but lost in
melancholy thought. As the sun was yet
too high to allow them to continue their
journey, and as it was necessary, that Lu∣dovico
after the toils and trouble he had
suffered, should finish his sleep, Emily
took this opportunity of enquiring by what
accident Du Pont became Montoni's pri∣soner,
and he, pleased with the interest
this enquiry expressed and with the excuse
it gave him for talking to her of himself,
immediately answered her curiosity.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="320"/>
“I came into Italy, madam,”said Du Pont,
“In the service of my country. In an
adventure among the mountains our party,
engaging with the bands of Montoni, was
routed, and I, with a few of my comrades,
was taken prisoner. When they told me,
whose captive I was, the name of Montoni
struck me, for I remembered, that Madame
Cheron, your aunt, had married an Italian
of that name, and that you had accompa∣nied
them into Italy. It was not, how∣ever,
till some time after, that I became
convinced this was the same Montoni, or
learned that you, madam, was under the
same roof with myself. I will not pain
you by describing what were my emotions
upon this discovery, which I owed to a
sentinel, whom I had so far won to my
interest, that he granted me many indul∣gences,
one of which was very important
to me, and somewhat dangerous to him∣self;
but he persisted in refusing to con∣vey
any. letter, or notice of my situation
to you, for he justly dreaded a disco∣very
<PB N="319" REF="321"/>
and the consequent vengeance of
Montoni. He however enabled me to
see you more than once. You are sur∣prised,
madam, and I will explain my∣self.
My health and spirits suffered ex∣tremely
from want of air and exercise, and,
at length, I gained so far upon the pity, or
the avarice of the man, that he gave me
the means of walking on the terrace.”</P>
<P>Emily now listened, with very anxious
attention, to the narrative of Du Pont, who
proceeded:</P>
<P>“In granting this indulgence, he knew,
that he had nothing to apprehend from a
chance of my escaping from a castle, which
was vigilantly guarded, and the nearest ter∣race
of which rose over a perpendicular rock;
he shewed me also,”continued Du Pont,
“a door concealed in the cedar wainscot
of the apartment where I was confined,
which he inctrusted me how to open;
and which, leading into a passage, formed
within the thickenss of the wall, that ex∣tended
far along the castle, finally opened
<PB N="320" REF="322"/>
in an obscure corner of the eastern rampart.
I have since been informed, that there are
many passages of the same kind concealed
within the prodigious walls of that edifice,
and which were, undoubtedly, contrived
for the purpose of facilitating escapes in
time of war. Through this avenue, at
the dead of night, I often stole to the ter∣race,
where I walked with the utmost cau∣tion,
left my steps should betray me to the
sentinels on duty in distant parts; for this
end of it, being guarded by high build∣ings,
was not watched by soldiers. In
one of these midnight wanderings, I saw
light in a casement that overlooked the
rampart, and which, I observed, was im∣mediately
over my prison-chamber. It
occurred to me, that you might be in that
apartment, and, with the hope of seeing
you, I placed myself opposite to the win∣dow.”</P>
<P>Emily remembering the figure that
had formerly appeared on the terrace, and
which had occasioned her so much anxiety,
<PB N="321" REF="323"/>
exclaimed, “It was? you then, Monsieur
Du Pont, who occasioned me much fool∣ish
terror; my spirits were, at chat time,
so much weakened by long suffering, that
they took alarm at every hint.”Du Pont,
after lamenting, that he had occasioned
her any apprehension, added, “As I
rested on the wall, opposite to your case∣ment,
the consideration of your melan∣choly
situation and of my own called
from me involuntary sounds of lamentar∣tion,
which drew you, I fancy, to the
casement; I saw there a person, whom I
believed to be you. O! I will say no∣thing
of my emotion at that moment; I
wished to speak, but prudence restrained
me, till the distant foot-step of a sentinel
compelled me suddenly to quit my sta∣tion.</P>
<P>“It was some time, before I had ano∣ther
opportunity of walking, for I could
only leave my prison, when it happened
to be the turn of one man to guard me;
meanwhile I became convinced from some
<PB N="322" REF="324"/>
circumstances related by him, that your
apartment was over mine, and, when
again I ventured forth, I returned to your
casement, where again I saw you, but
without daring to speak. I waved my
hand, and you suddenly disappeared; then
it was, that I forgot my prudence, and
yielded to lamentation; again you ap∣peared
—you spoke—I heard the well∣known
accent of your voice! and, at that
moment, my discretion would have for∣saken
me again, had I not heard also the
approaching steps of a soldier, when I in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tantly
quitted the place, though not be∣fore
the man had seen me. He followed
down the terrace and gained so fast upon
me, that I was compelled to make use of
a stratagem, ridiculous enough, to save
myself. I had heard of the supperstition of
many of these men, and I uttered a strange
noise, with a hope, that my pursuer would
imstake it for something supernatural, and
desist from pursuit. Luckily for myself
I succeeded; the man, it seems, was sob∣ject
<PB N="323" REF="325"/>
to fits, and the terror he suffered threw
him into one, by which accident I secured
my retreat. A sense of the danger I had
escaped, and the increased watchfulness,
which my appearance had occasioned a∣mong
the sentinels, deterred me ever after
from walking on the terrace; but, in the
stillness of night, I frequently beguiled my∣self
with an old lute, procured for me by
a soldier, which I sometimes accompanied
with my voice, and sometimes, I will ac∣knowledge,
with a hope of making myself
heard by you; but it was only a few even∣ings
ago, that this hope was answered. I
then thought I heard a voice in the wind,
calling me; yet, even then I feared to re∣ply,
lest the sentinel at the prison door
should hear me. Was I right, madam, in
this conjecture—was it you who spoke?”</P>
<P>“Yes,“said Emily” with an involun∣tary
sigh, “you was right indeed.”</P>
<P>Du Pont, observing the painful emo∣tions,
which this question revived, now
changed the subject “In one of my ex∣cursions
<PB N="324" REF="326"/>
through the passage, which I have
mentioned, I overheard a Singular conver∣sation,”
said he.
“In the passage!”said Emily, with
surprise.
“I heard it in the passage,”said Du
Pont, “but it proceeded from an apart∣ment,
adjoining the wall, within which the
passage wound, and the shell of the wall
was there so thin, and was also somewhat decayed, that I could distinctly hear every
word, spoken on the other side. It happened
that Montoni and his companions were as∣sembled
in the room, and Montoni began
to relate the extraordinary history of the
lady, his predecessor, in the castle. He
did, indeed, mention some very surprising
circumstances, and whether they were
strictly true, his conscience must decide; I
fear it will determine against him. But
you, madam, have doubtless heard the re∣port,
which he designs should circulate,
on the subject of that lady's mysterious
fate.”</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="327"/>
“I have, sir,”replied Emily, “and I perceive, that you doubt it,”
“I doubted it before the period I am
speaking of,”rejoined Du Pont;—“but
some circumstances, mentioned by Mon∣toni,
greatly contributed to my suspicions.
The account I then heard, almost con∣vinced
me, that he was a murderer. I
trembled for you;—the more so that I had
heard the guests mention your name in a
manner, that threatened your repose; and,
knowing, that the most impious men are
often the most superstitious, I determined
to try whether I could not awaken their
consciences, and awe them from the com∣mission.
of the crime I dreaded. I listened
closely to Montoni, and, in the most strik∣ing
passages of his story, I joined my voice,
and repeated his last words, in a disguised
and hollow tone.”</P>
<P>“But was you not afraid of being discovered?”said Emily.</P>
<P>“I was not,”replied Du Pont; “for
I knew, that, if Montoni had been ac∣quainted
<PB N="326" REF="328"/>
with the secret of this passage, he
would not have confined me in the apart∣ment,
to which it led, I knew also, from
better authority, that he was ignorant of it.
The party, for some time, appeared inat∣tentive
to my voice; but, at length, were so
much alarmed, that they quitted the
apartment; and, having heard Montoni
order his servants to search it, I returned
to my prison, which was very distant from
this part of the passage.”“I remember
perfectly to have heard of the conversation
you mention,” said Emily; “it spread a
general alarm among Montoni's people,
and I will own I was weak enough to par∣take
of it”</P>
<P>Monsieur Du Pont and Emily thus
continued to converse of Montoni, and
then of France, and of the plan of their
voyage; when Emily told him, that it
was her inten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to retire to a convent in
Languedoc, where she had been formerly
treated with much kindness, and from
thence to write to her relation Monsieur
<PB N="327" REF="329"/>
Quesnel, and inform him of her conduct.
There, she designed to wait, till La Vall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
should again be her own, whither she
hoped her income would some time per∣mit
her to return; for Du Pont now taught
her to expect, that the estate, of which
Montoni had attempted to defraud her,
was not irrecoverably lost, and he again
congratulated her on her escape from Mon∣toni,
who, he had not a doubt, meant to
have detained her for life. The possibility
of recovering her aunt's estates for Valan∣court
and herself lighted up a joy in
Emily's heart, such as she had not known
for many months; but she endeavoured to
conceal this from Monsieur Du Pont, left
it should lead him to a painful remem∣brance
of his rival.</P>
<P>they continued to converse, till the
sun was declining in the west, when
Du Pont awoke Ludovico, and they
set forward on their journey. Gradually
defcending the lower slopes of the valley,
they reached the Arno, and wound along
<PB N="328" REF="330"/>
its pastoral margin, for many miles, de∣lighted
with the scenery around them, and
with the remembrances, which its classic
waves revived. At a distance, they heard
the gay song of the peasants among the
vineyards, and observed the setting sun
tint the waves with yellow lustre, and twi∣light
draw a dusky purple over the moun∣tains,
which, at length, deepened into
night. Then the <HI>lucciola,</HI> the fire-fly of
Tuscany, was seen to flash its sudden sparks
among the foliage, while the <HI>cicala,</HI> with
its shrill note, became more clamorous
than, even during the noon-day heat, lov∣ing
best the hour when the English beetle,
with less offensive sound,
<Q><L>—“winds</L>
<L>His small but sullen horn,</L>
<L>As oft he rises, midst the twilight path,</L>
<L>Against the pilgrim bron in heedless hum<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collins.</NOTE>.”</L></Q></P>
<P>The travellers crossed the Arno by
moon-light, at a ferry, and learning, that
Pisa was distant only a few miles down the
<PB N="329" REF="331"/>
river, they wished to have proceeded thi∣ther
in a boat, but, as none could be pro∣cured,
they set out on their wearied horses
for that city. As they approached it, the
vale expandedinto a plain, variegated
with vineyards, corn, olives and mulberry
groves; but it was late, before they reached
its gates, where Emily was surprised to
hear the busy sound of sootsteps and the
tones of musical instruments, as well as to
see the lively groups, that filled the streets,
and she almost fancied herself again at
Venice; but here was no moon-light sea—
no gay gondolas, dashing the waves,—no
<HI>Palladian</HI> palaces, to throw enchantment
over the fancy and lead it into the wilds
of fairy story. The Arno rolled through
the town, but no music trembled from bal∣conies
over its waters; it gave only the
busy voices of sailors on board vessels just
arrived from the Mediterranean; the me∣lancholy
heaving of the anchor, and the
shrill boatswain's whistle;—sounds, which, since that period, have there sunk almost
<PB N="330" REF="332"/>
into silence. They then served to remind
Du Pont, that it was probable he might
hear of a vessel, sailing soon to France from
this port, and thus be spared the trouble of
going to Leghorn. As soon as Emily had reached
the inn, he went therefore to the
quay, to make his enquiries; but, after all
the endeavours of himself and Ludovico,
they could hear of no bark, destined im∣mediately
for France, and the travellers re∣turned
to their resting-place. Here also, Du
Pont endeavoured to learn where his regi∣ment
then lay, but could acquire no inform∣ation
concerning it. The travellers retired
early to rest, after the fatigues of this day;
and, on the following, rose early, and, without
pausing to view the celebrated antiquities
of the place, or the wonders of its hang∣ing
tower, pursued their journey in the
cooler hours, through a charming country,
rich with wine, and corn and oil. The
Apennines, no longer awful, or even grand,
here softened into the beauty of sylvan and
pastoral landscape; and Emily, as she de∣scended
<PB N="331" REF="333"/>
them, looked down delighted on
Leghorn, and its spacious bay, filled with
vessels, and crowned with these beautiful hills.</P>
<P>She was no less surprised and amused,
on entering this town, to find it crowded
with persons in the dresses of all nations;
a scene, which reminded her of a Venetian
masquerade, such as she had witnessed at the time of the Carnival; but here, was
bustle, without gaiety, and noise instead
of music, while elegance was to be looked
for only in the waving outlines of the sur∣rounding
hills.</P>
<P>Monsieur Du Pont, immediately on
their arrival, went down to the quay, where
he heard of several French vessels, and of
one, that was to fail, in a few days, for
Marseilles, from whence another vessel
could be procured, without difficulty, to
take them across the gulf of Lyons towards
Narbonne, on the coast not many leagues
from which city he understood the convent
was seated, to which Emily wished to retire.
<PB N="332" REF="334"/>
He, therefore, immediately engaged with
the captain to take them to Marseilles, and
Emily was delighted to hear, that her pas∣sage
to France was secured. Her mind
was now relieved from the terror of pursuit,
and the pleasing hope of soon seeing
her native country—that country which
held Valancourt, restored to her spirits a
degree of cheerfulness, such as she had
scarcely known, since the death of her fa∣ther.
At Leghorn also, Du Pont heard of
his regiment, and that it had embarked
for France; a circumstance, which gave
him great satisfaction, for he could now
accompany Emily thither, without re∣proach
ot his conscience, or apprehension
of displeasure from his commander. Dur∣ing
these days, he scrupulously forbore to
distress her by a mention of his passion,
and she was compelled to esteem and pity,
though she could not love, him. He en∣deavoured
to amuse her by shewing the
environs of the town, and they often walk∣ed
together on the sea-shore, and on the
<PB N="333" REF="335"/>
busy quays, where Emily was frequently
interested by the arrival and departure of
vessels, participating in the joy of meeting
friends, and, sometimes, shedding a sympa∣thetic
tear to the sorrow of those, that were
separating. It was after having witnessed
a scene of the latter kind, that she arranged
the following stanzas:</P>

<P>WE now return to Languedoc and to
the mention of Count De Villefort, the
nobleman, who succeeded to an estate of
the Marquis De Villeroi, situated near the
monastery of Sr. Claire. It may be re∣collected,
that this chateau was uninha∣bited,
when St. Aubert and his daughter
were in the neighbourhood, and that the
former was much affected on discovering
himself to be so near Chateau-le-Blanc,
a place, concerning which the good old
La Voisin afterwards dropped some hints,
that had alarmed Emily's curiosity.</P>
<P>It was in the year 1584, the beginning
of that, in which St. Aubert died, that
Francis Beauveau, Count De Villefort,
<PB N="337" REF="339"/>
came into possession of the mansion and
extensive domain called Chateau-le-Blanc,
situated in the province of Languedoc, on the shore of the Mediterranean, This
estate, which, during some centuries, had
belonged to his family, now descended to
him, on the decease of his relative, the
Marquis De Villeroi, who had been lat∣terly
a man of reserved manners and aus∣tere
character; circumstances, which, to∣gether
with the duties of his profession,
that often called him into the field, had
prevented any degree of intimacy with his
cousin, the Count De Villefort. For many
years, they had known little of each other, and the Count received the first intelli∣gence
of his death, which happened in a
distant part of France, together with the instruments, that gave him possession of
the domain Chateau-le-BIanc; but it was
not till the following year, that he deter∣mined
to visit that estate, when he design∣ed
to pass the autumn there. The scenes
of Chateau-le-Blanc often came to his
<PB N="338" REF="340"/>
remembrance, heightened by the touches,
which a warm imagination gives to the
recollection of early pleasures; for many
years before, in the life-time of the Mar-chioness, and at that age when the mind
is particularly sensible to impressions of
gaiety and delight, he had once visited this
spot, and, though he had passed a long
intervening period amidst the vexations
and tumults of public affairs, which too
frequently corrode the heart, and vitiate
the taste, the shades of Languedoc and
the grandeur of its distant scenery had
never been remembered by him with in∣difference.</P>
<P>During many years, the chateau had been
abandoned by the late Marquis, and, being
inhabited only by an old steward and his
wife, had been suffered to fall much into
decay. To superintend the repairs, that
would be requisite to make it a comfort∣able
residence, had been a principal mo∣tive
with the Count for passing the autum∣nal
months in Languedoc; and neither
<PB N="339" REF="341"/>
the remonstrances, or the tears of the Coun∣tess,
for, on urgent occasions, she could
weep, were powerful enough to overcome
his determination. She prepared, there∣fore,
to obey the command, which she
could not conquer, and to resign the gay assemblies of Paris,—where her beauty was
generally unrivalled and won the applause,
to which her wit had but feeble claim—
for the twilight canopy of woods, the
lonely grandeur of mountains and the so∣lemnity
of gothic halls and of long, long
galleries, which echoed only the solitary
step of a domestic, or the measured clink,
that ascended from the great clock—the
ancient monitor of the hall below. From
these melancholy expectations she endea∣voured
to relieve her spirits by recollect∣ing
all that she had ever heard, concern∣ing
the joyous vintage of the plains of
Languedoc; but there, alas! no airy
forms would bound to the gay melody of
Parisian dances, and a view of the rustic
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of peasants could afford little
<PB N="340" REF="342"/>
pleasure to a heart, in which even the feel∣ings
of ordinary benevolence had long
since decayed under the corruptions of
luxury.</P>
<P>The Count had a son and a daughter,
the children of a former marriage, who,
he designed, should accompany him to
the south. of France; Henri, who was in
his twentieth year, was in the French ser∣vice;
and Blanche, who was not yet eigh∣teen,
had been hitherto confined to the
convent, where she had been placed imme∣diately
on her father's second marriage.
The present Countess, who had neither
sufficient ability, or inclination, to super∣intend
the education of her daughter-in-law,
had advised this step, and the dread
of superior beauty had since urged her
to employ every art, that might prevail
on the Count to prolong the period of
Blanche's seclusion; it was, therefore, with
extreme mortification, that she now un∣derstood
he would no longer submit on
this subject, yet it afforded her some con∣solation
<PB N="341" REF="343"/>
to consider, that, though the Lady
Blanche would emerge from her convent,
the shades of the country would, for some
time, veil her beauty from the public eye.</P>
<P>On the morning, which commenced
the journey, the postillions stopped at the
convent, by the Count's order, to take up
Blanche, whose heart beat with delight,
at the prospect of novelty and freedom
now before her. As the time of her de∣parture
drew nigh, her impatience had
increased, and the last night, during
which she counted every note of every
hour, had appeared the most tedious of
any she had ever known. The morning
light, at length, dawned; the matin-bell
rang; she heard the nuns descending
from their chambers, and she started from
a sleepless pillow to welcome the day,
which was to emancipate her from the
severities of a cloister, and introduce her
to a world, where pleasure was ever smil∣ing,
and goodness ever blessed—where,
in short, nothing but pleasure and good∣ness
<PB N="342" REF="344"/>
reigned! When the bell of the great gate
rang, and the sound was followed by
that of carriage wheels, she ran, with a
palpitating heart, to her lattice, and, per∣ceiving
her father's carriage in the court
below, danced, with airy steps, along the
gallery, where she was met by a nun with
a summons from the abbess. In the next
moment, she was in the parlour, and in
the presence of the Countess who now
appeared to her as an angel, that was to
lead her into happiness. But the emotions
of the Countess, on beholding her, were
not in unison with those of Blanche, who
had never appeared so lovely as at this mo∣ment,
when her countenance, animated
by the lightning smile of joy, glowed
with the beauty of happy innocence.</P>
<P>After conversing for a few minutes with
the abbess, the Countess rose to go. This
was the moment, which Blanche had an∣ticipated
with such eager expectation, the
summit from which she looked down upon
the fairy-land of happiness, and surveyed,
<PB N="343" REF="345"/>
all its enchantment; was it a moment,
then, for tears of regret? Yet it was so.
She turned, with an altered and dejected
countenance, to her young companions,
who were come to bid her farewell, and
wept! Even my lady abbess, so stately
and so solemn, she saluted with a degree
of sorrow, which, an hour before, she
would have believed it impossible to feel,
and which may be accounted for by con∣sidering
how reluctantly we all part, even with
unpleasing objects, when the sepa∣ration
is consciously for ever. Again, she
kissed the poor nuns and then followed the
Countess from that spot with tears, which
she expected to leave only with smiles.</P>
<P>But the presence of her father and the
variety of objects, on the road, soon en∣gaged
her attention, and dissipated the
shade, which tender regret had thrown
upon her spirits. Inattentive to a conver∣sation,
which was passing between the
Countess and a Mademoiselle Bearn, her
friend, Blanche sat, lost in pleasing reverie,
<PB N="344" REF="346"/>
as she watched the clouds floating silently
along the blue expanse, now veiling the
sun and stretching their shadows along the
distant scene, and then disclosing all his
brightness. The journey continued to
give Blanche inexpressible delight, for
new scenes of nature were every instant
opening to her view, and her fancy be∣came
stored with gay and beautiful ima∣gery.</P>
<P>It was on the evening of the seventh day,
that the travellers came within view of
Chateau-le-Blanc, the romantic beauty of
whose situation strongly impressed the ima∣gination
of Blanche, who observed, with
sublime astonishment, the Pyrenean moun∣tains,
which, had been seen only at a dis∣tance
during the day, now rising within
a few leagues, with their wild cliffs and
immense precipices, which the evening
clouds, floating round them, now dis∣closed,
and again veiled. The setting
rays, that tinged their snowy summits
with a roseate hue, touched their lower
<PB N="345" REF="347"/>
points with various colouring, while the
blueish tint, that pervaded their shadowy
recesses, gave the strength of contrast to
the splendour of light. The plains of Lan∣guedoc,
blushing with the purple vine and
diversified with groves of mulberry, al∣mond
and olives, spread far to the north
and the east; to the south, appeared the
Mediterranean, clear as crystal, and blue as
the heavens it reflected, bearing on its bo∣som
vessels, whose white fails caught the
fun-beams,, and gave animation to the
scene. On a high promontory, washed
by the waters of the Mediterranean, flood
her father's mansion, almost secluded from
the eye by woods of intermingled pine,
oak and chesnut, which crowned the emi∣nence,,
and sloped towards the plains, on
one side; while, on the other, they ex∣tended
to a considerable distance along
the sea-shores.</P>
<P>As Blanche drew nearer, the gothic
features of this antient mansion successively
appeared—first an embattled turret, rising
<PB N="346" REF="348"/>
above the trees—then the broken arch of
an immense gate-way, retiring beyond
them; and she almost fancied herself ap∣proaching
a castle, such as is often cele∣brated
in early story, where the knights
look out from the battlements on some
champion below, who, clothed in black
armour, comes, with his companions, to
rescue the fair lady of his love from the
oppression of his rival; a sort of legends,
to which she had once or twice obtain∣ed
access in the library of her convent,
that, like many others, belonging to the
monks, was stored with these reliques of
romantic fiction.</P>
<P>The carriages slopped at a gate, which
led into the domain of the chateau, but
which, was now fastened; and the great
bell, that had formerly served to an∣nounce
the arrival of strangers, having
long since fallen from its station, a servant
climbed over a, ruined part of the adjoining
wall, to give notice to those within of the
arrival of their loid.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="349"/>
As Blanche leaned from the coach win∣dow,
she resigned herself to the sweet and
gentle emotions, which the hour and the
scenery awakened. The sun had now left
the earth, and twilight began to darken the
mountains; while the distant waters, re∣flecting
the blush that still glowed in the
west, appeared like a line of light, skirt∣ing
the horizon. The low murmur of
waves, breaking on the shore, came in
the breeze, and, now and then, the me∣lancholy
dashing of oars was feebly heard
from a distance. She was s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffered to in∣dulge
her pensive mood, for the thoughts
of the rest of the party were silently en∣gaged
upon the subjects of their several
interests. Meanwhile, the Countess, re∣flecting,
with regret, upon the gay parties
she had left at Paris, surveyed, with dis∣gust,
what she thought the gloomy woods
and solitary wildness of the scene; and,
shrinking from the prospect of being shut
up in an old castle, was prepared to meet
every object with displeasure. The feel∣ings
<PB N="348" REF="350"/>
of Henri were somewhat similar to
those of the Countess; he gave a mourn∣ful
sigh to the delights of the capital, and
to the remembrance of a lady, who, he
believed, had engaged his affections, and
who had certainly fascinated his imagina∣tion;
but the surrounding country, and
the mode of life, on which he was enter∣ing,
had, for him, at least, the charm of
novelty, and his regret was softened by
the gay expectations of youth.</P>
<P>The gates being at length unbarred, the
carriage moved slowly on, under spreading
chesnuts, that almost excluded the remains
of day, following what had been formerly
a road, but which now, overgrown with
luxuriant vegetation, could be traced only
by the boundary, formed by trees, on ei∣ther
side, and which wound for near half a
mile among the woods, before it reached
the chateau. This was the very avenue
that St. Auhert and Emily had formerly
entered, on their first arrival in the neigh∣bourhood
with the hope of finding a house,
<PB N="349" REF="351"/>
that would receive them, for the night,
and had so abruptly quitted, on perceiving
the wildness of the place, and a figure,
which the postillion had fancied was a
robber.</P>
<P>“What a dismal place is this!” ex∣claimed
the Countess, as the carriage pene∣trated
the deeper reces ses of the woods.
“Surely, my lord, you do not mean to
pass all the autumn in this barbarous spot!
One ought to bring hither a cup of the
waters of Lethe, that the remembrance of
pleasanter scenes may not heighten, at
least, the natural dreariness of these.”</P>
<P>“I shall be governed by circumstances,
madam,” said the Count,“this barbarous.
spot was inhabited by my ancestors.”</P>
<P>The carriage now stopped at the cha∣teau,
where, at the door of the great hall,
appeared the old steward and the Parisian
servants, who had been sent to prepare the
chateau, waiting to receive their lord.
Lady Blanche now perceived, that the edi∣fice
was not built entirely in the gothic
<PB N="350" REF="352"/>
style, but that it had additions of a more
modern date; the large and gloomy hall,
however, into which she now entered, was
entirely gothic, and sumptuous tapestry,
which it was now too dark to distinguish,
hung upon the walls, and depictured scenes
from some of the antient Provencal ro∣mançes.
A vast gothic window, embroi∣dered
with <HI>clematis</HI> and eglantine, that as∣cended
to the south, led the eye, now that
the casements were thrown open, through
this verdant shade, over a sloping lawn,
to the tops of dark woods, that hung upon
the brow of the promontory. Beyond, ap∣peared
the waters of the Mediterranean,
stretching far to the south, and to the east,
where they were lost in the horizon; while,
to the north-east, they were bounded by
the luxuriant shores of Languedoc and
Provence, enriched with wood, and gay
with vines and sloping pastures; and, to
the south-west, by the majestic Pyren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,
now fading from the eye, beneath the gra∣dual
gloom.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="353"/>
Blanche, as she crossed the hall, stopped
a moment to observe this lovely prospect,
which the evening twilight obscured, yet
did not conceal. But she was quickly
awakened from the complacent delight,
which this scene had diffused upon her
mind, by the Countess, who, discontented
with every object around, and impatient
for refreshment and repose, hastened for∣ward
to a large parlour, whose cedar
wainscot, narrow, pointed casements, and
dark ceiling of carved cypress wood, gave
it an aspect of peculiar gloom, which the
dingy green velvet of the chairs and
co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches, fringed with tarnished gold, had
once been designed to enliven.</P>
<P>While the Countess enquired for refresh∣ment,
the Count, attended by his son,
went to look over-sbme part of the chateau,
and Lady Blanche reluctantly remained to
witness the discontent and ill-humour of
her step-mother.</P>
<P>“How long have you lived in this de∣solate
place?” said her ladyship, to the old
<PB N="352" REF="354"/>
house-keeper, who came to pay her duty.
“Above twenty years, your ladyship,
on the next feast of St. Jerome.”</P>
<P>“How happened it, that you have lived
here so long, and almost alone, too? I un∣derstood,
that the chateau, had been shut
up for some years?”</P>
<P>“Yes, madam, it was for many years
after my late lord, the Count, went to
the wars; but it is above twenty years,
since I and my husband came into his ser∣vice.
The place is so. large, and has of
late been so lonely, that we were lost in it,
and, after some time, we went to live
in a cottage at the end of the woods, near
some of the tenants, and came to look af∣ter
the chateau, every now and then.
When my lord returned to France from
the wars, he took a dislike to the place,
and never came to live here again, and so
he was satisfied with our remaining at the
cottage. Alas—alas! how the chateau is
changed from what it once was! What
delight my late lady used to take in it! I
<PB N="353" REF="355"/>
well remember when she came here a bride,
and how fine it was. Now, it has been ne∣glected
so long, and is gone into such de∣cay!
I shall never see those days again!”</P>
<P>The Countess appearing to be somewhat
offended by the thoughtless simplicity, with
which the old woman regretted former
times, Dorothée added—“But the chateau
will now be inhabited, and cheerful again;
not all the world could tempt me to live
in it alone.”</P>
<P>“Well, the experiment will not be
made, I believe,” said the Countess, dis∣pleased
that her own silence had been un∣able
to awe the loquacity of this rustic
old housekeeper, now spared from further
attendance by the entrance of the Count,
who said he had been viewing part of the
chateau, and found, that it would require
considerable repairs and some alterations,
before it would be perfectly comfortable,
as a place of residence. “I am sorry to
hear it, my lord,” replied the Countess.
“And why sorry, madam?” Because
<PB N="354" REF="356"/>
the place will ill repay your trouble; and
were it even a paradise, it would be insuf∣ferable
at such a distance from Paris.”</P>
<P>The Count made no reply, but walked
abruptly to a window. “There are win∣dows,
my lord, but they neither admit en∣tertainment,
or light; they shew only a
scene of savage nature.”</P>
<P>“I am at a loss, madam,” said the
Count, “to conjecture what you mean by
savage nature. Do those plains, or those
woods, or that fine expanse of water, de∣serve
the name?”
“Those mountains certainly do, my
lord,” rejoined the Countess, pointing to
the Pyrenées, “and this chateau, though
not a work of rude nature, is, to my taste,
at least, one of savage art.” The Count
coloured highly. “This place, madam,
was the work of my ancestors.” said he,
“and you must allow me to say, that your
present conversation discovers neither good
taste, or good manners.” Blanche, now
shocked at an altercation, which appeared
<PB N="355" REF="357"/>
to be increasing to a serious disagreement,
rose to leave the room, when her mother's
woman entered it; and the Countess, im∣mediately
desiring to be shewn to her own
apartment, withdrew, attended by Made∣moiselle
Bearn.</P>
<P>Lady Blanche, it being not yet dark,
took this opportunity of exploring new
scenes, and, leaving the parlour, she passed
from the hall into a wide gallery, whose
walls were decorated by marble pilasters,
which supported an arched roof, composed
of a rich mosaic work. Through a dis∣tant
window, that seemed to terminate the
gallery, were seen the purple clouds of
evening and a landscape, whose features,
thinly veiled in twilight, no longer ap∣peared
distinctly, but, blended into one
grand mass, stretched to the horizon, co∣loured
only with a tint of solemn grey.</P>
<P>The gallery terminated in a saloon, to
which the window she had seen through an
open door, belonged; but the increasing
dusk permitted her only an imperfect view
<PB N="356" REF="358"/>
of this apartment, which seemed to be
magnificent and of modern architecture;
though it had been either suffered to fall
into decay, or had never been properly
finished. The windows, which were nu∣merous
and large, descended low, and af∣forded
a very extensive, and what Blanche's
fancy represented to be, a very lovely
prospect; and she stood for some time,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urveying the grey obscu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and depic∣turing
imaginary woods and mountains,
vallies and rivers, on this scene of night;
her solemn sensations rather assisted, than
interrupted, by the distant bark of a watch∣dog,
and by the breeze, as it trembled
upon the light foliage of the shrubs. Now
and then, appeared for a moment, among
the woods, a cottage light; and, at length,
was heard, afar off, the evening bell of a
convent, dying on the air. When she
withdrew her thoughts from these subjects
of fanciful delight, the gloom and silence
of the saloon somewhat awed her; and,
having sought the door of the gallery, and
<PB N="357" REF="359"/>
pursued, for a considerable time, a dark
passage, she came to a hall, but one to∣tally
different from that she had formerly
seen. By the twilight, admitted through
an open portico, she could just distinguish
this apartment to be of very light and. airy
architecture, and that it was paved with
white marble, pillars of which supported
the roof, that rose into arches built in the
Moorish style. While Blanche stood on
the steps of this portico, the moon rose
over the sea, and gradually disclosed, in
partial light, the beauties of the eminence,
on which she stood, whence a lawn, now
rude and overgrown with high grass, sloped
to the woods, that, almost surrounding
the chateau, extended in a grand sweep
down the southern sides of the promontory
to the very margin of the ocean. Beyond
the woods, on the north-side, appeared a
long tract of the plains of Languedoc;
and, to the east, the landscape she had be∣fore
dimly seen, with the towers of a mo∣nastery,
illumined by the moon, rising over
dark groves.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="360"/>
The soft and shadowy tint, that over∣spread
the scene, the waves, undulating in
the moon-light, and their low and mea∣sured
murmurs on the beach, were circum∣stances,
that united to elevate the unac∣customed
mind of Blanche to enthusiasim.</P>
<P>“And have I lived in this glorious
world fo long,” said she, ”and never till
now beheld such a prospect—never expe∣rienced
these delights! Every peasant girl,
on my father's domain, has viewed from
her infancy the face of nature; has ranged,
at liberty, her romantic wilds, while I
have been shut in a cloister from the
view of these beautiful appearances, which
were designed to enchant all eyes, and
awaken all hearts. How can the poor
nuns and. friars feel the full fervour of de∣votion,
if they never see the sun rise,
or set? Never, till this evening, did I
know what true devotion is; for, never
before did I see the sun sink below the
vast earth! To-morrow, for the first time
in my life, I will see it rise. O who
<PB N="359" REF="361"/>
would live in Paris, to look upon black
walls and dirty streets, when, in the coun∣try,
they might gaze on the blue heavens,
and all the green earth!”</P>
<P>This enthusiastic soliloquy was inter∣rupted
by a rustling noise in the hall; and,
while the loneliness of the place made her
sensible to fear, she thought she perceived
something moving between the pillars.
For a moment, she continued silently ob∣serving it,
till, ashamed of her ridiculous
apprehensions, she recollected courage
enough to demand who was there. “O
my young lady, is it you?” said the old
housekeeper, who was come to shut the
windows, “I am glad it is you.” The
manner, in which she spoke this, with a
faint breath, rather surprisecl Blanche, who
said, “You seemed frightened, Dorothée,
what is the matter?”</P>
<P>“No, not frightened, ma'amselle,” re∣plied
Dorothée, hesitating and trying to
appear composed, “but I am old, and—
a little matter, startles me.” The Lady
<PB N="360" REF="362"/>
Blanche smiled at the distinction. “I am
glad, that my lord the Count is come to
live at the chateau, ma'amselle,” continued
Doroth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, “for it has been many a year
deserred, and dreary enough; now, the
place will look a little as it used to do,
when my poor lady was alive.” Blanche
enquired how long it was, since the Mar∣chioness
died? “Alas! my lady, ”re∣plied
Dorotheacute;e, “so long—that I have
ceased to count the years! The place, to
my mind, has mourned ever since, and I
am sure my lord's vassals have! But you
have lost yourself, ma'amselle,—shall I
shew you to the other side of the cha∣teau?”</P>
<P>Blanche enquired how long this part of
the edifice had been built. “Soon after
my lord's marriage, ma'am,” replied Do∣rothée.
“The place was large enough
without this addition, for many rooms of
the old building were even then never
made use of, and my lord had a princely
household too; but he thought the antient
<PB N="361" REF="363"/>
mansion gloomy, and gloomy enough it
is!” Lady Blanche now, desired to be
shewn to the inhabited part of the cha∣teau;
and, as the passages were entirely
dark, Dorothée conducted her along the
edge of the lawn to the opposite side of the
edisice, where, a door opening into the
great hall, she was met by Mademoiselle
Bearn. “Where have you been so long?”
said she, “I had begun to think some
wonderful adventure had befallen you, and
that the giant of this enchanted castle, or
the ghost, which, no doubt, haunts it, had
conveyed you through a trap-door into
some subterranean vault, whence you was
never to return.”</P>
<P>“No,” replied Blanche, laughingly,
“you seem to love adventures so well, that
I leave them for you to achieve.”</P>
<P>“Well, I am willing to achieve them,
provided I am allowed to describe them.”</P>
<P>“My dear Mademoiselle Bearn,” said
Henri, as he met her at the door of the
<PB N="362" REF="364"/>
parlour, “no ghost of these days would
be so savage as to impose silence on you.
Our ghosts are more civilized than to con∣demn
a lady to a purgatory severer even,
than their own, be it what it may.”</P>
<P>Mademoiselle Bearn replied only by a
laugh; and, the Count now entering the
room, supper was served, during which
he spoke little, frequently appeared to
be abstracted from the company, and
more than once remarked, that the place
was greatly altered, since he had last seen
it. “Many years have intervened since
that period,” said he; “and, though the
grand features of the scenery admit of
no change, they impress me with sensa∣tions
very different from those I formerly
experienced.”</P>
<P>?“Did these scenes, sir,” said Blanche,
“ever appear more lovely, than they do
now? To me this seems hardly possible.”
The Count, regarding her with a melan∣choly
smile, said, “They once were as
<PB N="363" REF="365"/>
delightful to me, as they are now to you;
the landscape is not changed, but time has
changed me; from my mind the illusion,
which gave spirit to the colouring of na∣ture,
is fading fast! If you live, my dear
Blanche, to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>visit this spot, at the dis∣tance
of many years, you will, perhaps,
remember and understand the feelings of
your father.”</P>
<P>Lady Blanche, affected by these words,
remained silent; she looked forward to the
period, which the Count anticipated, and
considering, that he, who now spoke,
would then probably be no more, her
eyes, bent to the ground, were filled with
tears. She gave her hand to her father,
who, smiling affectionately, rose from his
chair, and went to a window to conceal
his emotion.</P>
<P>The fatigues of the day made the party
separate at an early hour, when Blanche
retired through a long oak gallery to her
chamber, whose spacious and lofty walls,
<PB N="364" REF="366"/>
high antiquated casements, and, what was
the effect of these., its gloomy air, did not
reconcile her to its remote situation, in
this antient building. The furniture, also,
was of antient date; the bed was of blue
damask, trimmed with tarnished gold lace,
and its lofty tester rose in the form of a
canopy, whence the curtains descended,
like those of such tents as are sometimes
represented in old pictures, and, indeed,
much resembling those, exhibited on the
faded tapestry, with which the chamber
was hung. To Blanche, every object here
was matter of curiosity; and, taking the
light from her woman to examine the
tapestry, she perceived, that it represented
scenes from the wars of Troy, though the
almost colourless worsted now mocked the
glowing actions they once had painted.
She laughed at the ludicrous absurdity she
observed, till, recollecting, that the hands,
which had wove it, were, like the poet
whose thoughts of fire they had attempted
<PB N="365" REF="367"/>
to express, long since mouldered into dust,
a train of melancholy ideas passed over her
mind, and she almost wept.</P>
<P>Having given her woman a strict in∣junction
to awaken her, before sun-rise,
she dismissed her; and then, to dissipate
the gloom, which reflection had cast upon
her spirits, opened one of the high case∣ments,
and was again cheered by the face
of living nature. The shadowy earth,
the air, and ocean—all was still. Along
the deep serene of the heavens, a few
light clo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds floated slowly, through whose
skirts the stars now seemed to tremble,
and now to emerge with purer splendour.
Blanche's thoughts arose involuntarily to
the Great Author of the sublime objects
she contemplated, and she breathed a
prayer of finer devotion, than any she had
ever uttered beneath the vaulted roof of
a cloister. At this casement, she remained
till the glooms of midnight were stretched
over the prospect. She then retired to
<PB N="366" REF="368"/>
her pillow, and, “with gay visions of to∣morrow,”
to those sweet slumbers, which
health and happy innocence only know.</P>
<Q>“To-morrow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sresh woods and pastures new.”</Q>

<P>BLANCHE's slumbers continued, till
long after the hour, which she had so im∣patiently
anticipated, for her woman, fa∣tigued
with travelling, did not call her,
till breakfast was nearly ready. Her dis∣appointment,
however, was instantly for∣gotten,
when, on opening the casement,
she saw, on one hand, the wide sea spark∣ling
in the morning rays, with its stealing
sails and glancing oars; and, on the other,
the fresh woods, the plains far-stretching
and the blue mountains, all glowing with
the splendour of day.</P>
<P>As she inspired the pure breeze, health
<PB N="368" REF="370"/>
spread a deeper blush upon her counte∣nance,
and pleasure danced in her eyes.
“Who could first invent convents!”
said she, “and who could first persuade
people to go into them? and to make re∣ligion
a pretence, too, where all that
should inspire it, is so carefully shut out!
God is best pleased with the homage of a
grateful heart, and, when we view his
glories, we feel most grateful. I never
felt so much devotion, during the many
dull years I was in the convent, as. I have
done in the few hours, that I have been
here, where I need only look on all around
me—to adore God in my inmost heart!”</P>
<P>Saying this, she left the window, bound∣ed
along the gallery, and, in the next mo∣ment,
was in the breakfast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>room, where
the Count was already seated. The cheer∣fulness
of a bright sunshine had dispersed
the melancholy glooms of his reflections,
a pleasant smile was on his countenance,
and he spoke in an enlivening voice to
Blanche, whose heart echoed back the
<PB N="369" REF="371"/>
tones. Henri and, soon after, the Coun∣tess
with Mademoiselle Bearn appeared,
and the whole party seemed to acknow∣ledge
the influence of the scene, even the
Countess was so much re-animated as to
receive the civilities of her husband with
complacency, and but once forgot her
good-humour, which was when she asked
whether they had any neighbours, who
were likely to make <HI>this barbarous spot</HI>
more tolerable, and whether the Count
believed it possible for her to exist here,
without some amusement?”</P>
<P>Soon after breakfast the party dispersed;
the Count, ordering his steward to attend
him in the library, went to survey the con∣dition
of his premises, and to visit some of
his tenants; Henri hastened with alacrity
to the shore to examine a boat, that was to
bear them on a little vovage in the evening
and to superintend the adjustment of a silk
awning; while the Countess, attended by
Mademoiselle Bearn, retired to an apart∣ment
on the modern side of the chateau,
<PB N="370" REF="372"/>
which was fitted up with airy elegance;
and, as the windows opened upon balco∣nies,
that fronted the sea, she was there
saved from a view of the <HI>horrid</HI> Pyrenées.
Here, while she reclined on a sofa, and,
casting her languid eyes over the ocean,
which appearrd beyond the wood-tops,
indulged in the luxuries of <HI>ennui,</HI> her com∣panion.
read aloud a sentimental novel,
on some fashionable system of philosophy,
for the Countess was herself somewhat of a
<HI>philosopher,</HI> especially as to <HI>infidelity,</HI> and
among a certain circle her opinions were
waited for with impatience, and received as
doctrines.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, hastened to
indulge, amidst the wild wood-walks around
the chateau, her new enthusiasm, where,
as she wandered under the shades, her gay
spirits gradually yielded to pensive com∣placency.
Now, she moved with solemn
steps, beneath the gloom of thickly inter∣woven
branches, where the fresh dew still
hung upon every flower, that peeped from
<PB N="371" REF="373"/>
among the grass; and now tripped spor∣tively
along the path, on which the sun∣beams
darted and the checquered foliage
trembled—where the tender greens of the
beech, the acacia and the mountain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ash,
mingling with the solemn tints of the
cedar, the pine and cypress, exhibited as
fine a contrast of colouring, as the majestic
oak and oriental plane did of form, to the
feathery lightness of the cork tree and the
waving grace of the poplar.</P>
<P>Having reached a rustic seat, within a
deep recess of the woods, she rested awhile,
and, as her eyes caught, through a distant
opening, a glimpse of the blue waters of the
Mediterranean, with the white sail, gliding
on its bosom, or of the broad mountain,
glowing beneath the mid-day sun, her
mind experienced somewhat of that exqui∣site
delight, which awakens the fancy, and
leads to poetry. The hum of bees alone
broke the stillness around her, as, with
other in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ects of various hues, they sported
gaily in the shade, or sipped sweets from
<PB N="372" REF="374"/>
the fresh flowers; and, while Blanche
watched a butter-fly, flitting from bud to
bud, she indulged herself in imagining
the pleasures of its short day, till she had com∣posed
the following stanzas.</P>

<P><PB N="375" REF="377"/>
When Lady Blanche returned to the cha∣teau,
instead of going to the apartment of
the Countess, she amused herself with wan∣dering
over that part of the edifice, which
she had not yet examined, of which the
most antient first attracted her curiosity;
for, though what she had seen of the mo∣dern
was gay and elegant, there was some∣thing
in the former more interesting to her
imagination. Having passed up the great
stair-case, and through the oak gallery, she
entered upon a long suite of chambers,
whose walls were either hung with tapestry,
or wainscoted with cedar, the furniture of
which looked almost as antient as the rooms
themselves; the spacious fire-places, where
no mark of social cheer remained, pre∣sented
an image of cold desolation; and
the whole suite had so much the air of
neglect and desertion, that it seemed, as if
the venerable persons, whose portraits hung
upon the walls, had been the last to inha∣bit
them.</P>
<P>On leaving these rooms, she found her∣self
<PB N="376" REF="378"/>
in another gallery, one end of which
was terminated by a back stair-case, and
the other by a door, that seemed to com∣municate
with the north-side of the cha∣teau,
but which being fastened, she de∣scended
the stair-case, and, opening a door
in the wall, a few steps down, found her∣self
in a small square room, that formed
part of the west turret of the castle. Three
windows presented each a separate and
beautiful prospect; that to the north, over∣looking
Languedoc; another to the west,
the hills ascending towards the Pyrenés,
whose awful summits crowned the land∣scape;
and a third, fronting the south, gave
the Mediterranean, and a part of the wild
shores of Rousillon, to the eye.</P>
<P>Having left the turret, and descended
the narrow stair-case, she found herself in
a dusky passage, where she wandered, un∣able
to find her way, till impatience yield∣ed
to apprehension, and she called for as∣sistance.
Presently steps approached, and
light glimmered through a door at the
<PB N="377" REF="379"/>
other extremity of the passage, which was
opened with caution by some person, who
did not venture beyond it, and whom
Blanche observed in silence, till the door
was closing, when she called aloud, and,
hastening towards it, perceived the old
housekeeper.</P>
<P>“Dear ma'amselle! is it you?” said
Dorothée, “How could you find your
way hither?” Had Blanche been less oc∣cupied
by her own fears, she would pro∣bably
have observed the strong expressions
of terror and surprise on Doroth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e's conn∣tenance,
who now led her through a long
succession of passages and rooms, that
looked as if they had been uninhabited
for a century, till they reached that ap∣propriated
to the housekeeper, where Do∣roth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
entreated she would sit down and
take refreshment. Blanche accepted the
sweet meats, offered to her, mentioned her
discovery of the pleasant turret, and her
wish to appropriate it to her own use.
Whether Dorothée's taste was not so sen∣sible
<PB N="378" REF="380"/>
to the beauties of landscape as her
young lady's, or that the constant view of
lovely scenery had deadened it, she for∣bore
to praise the subject of Blanche's en∣thusiasm,
which, however, her silence did
not repress. To Lady Blanche's enquiry,
of whither the door she had found fastened
at the end of the gallery led, she replied,
that it opened to a suite of rooms, which
had not been entered, during many years,
“For,” added she, “my late lady died
in one of them, and I could never find in
my heart to go into them since.”</P>
<P>Blanche, though she wished to see these chambers, forbore, on observing that Do∣rothée's
eyes were filled with tears, to ask
her to unlock them, and, soon after, went
to dress for dinner, at which the whole
party met in good spirits and good hu∣mour,
except the Countess, whose vacant
mind, overcome by the languor of idle∣ness,
would neither suffer her to be happy
herself, or to contribute to the happiness
of others. Mademoiselle Bearm, attempt∣ing
<PB N="379" REF="381"/>
to be witty, directed her <HI>badinage</HI>
against Henri, who answered, because
he could not well avoid it, rather than
from any inclination to notice her, whose
liveliness sometimes amused, but whose
conceit and insensibility often disgusted
him.</P>
<P>The cheerfulness, with which Blanche
rejoined the party, vanished, on her
reaching the margin of the sea; she gazed
with apprehension upon the immense ex∣panse
of waters, which, at a distance, she
had beheld only with delight and asto∣nishment,
and it was by a strong effort,
that she so far overcame her fears as to fol∣low
her father into the boat.</P>
<P>As she silently surveyed the vast hori∣zon,
bending round the distant verge of
the ocean, an emotion of sublimest rap∣ture
struggled to overcome a sense of per∣sonal
danger. A light breeze played on
the water, and on the silk awning of the
boat, and waved the foliage of the reced∣ing
<PB N="380" REF="382"/>
woods, that crowned the cliffs, for
many miles, and which the Count sur∣veyed
with the pride of conscious property,
as well as with the eye of taste.</P>
<P>At some distance, among these woods,
stood a pavilion, which had once been the
scene of social gaiety, and which its situa∣tion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
still made one of romantic beauty.
Thither, the Count had ordered coffee and
other refreshment to be carried, and thi∣ther
the sailors now steered their course,
following the windings of the shore round
many a woody promontory and circling
bay; while the pensive tones of horns and
other wind instruments, played by the at∣tendants
in a distant boat, echoeda mong
the rocks, and died along the waves.
Blanche had now subdued her fears; a
delightful tranquillity stole over her mind,
and held her in silence; and she was too
happy even to remember the convent, or
her former sorrows, as subjects of com∣parison
with her present felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="383"/>
The Countess felt lessunhappy than she
had done, since the moment of her leav∣ing
Paris; for her mind was now under
some degree of restraint; she feared to in∣dulge
its wayward humours, and even
wished to recover the Count's good opi∣nion.
On his family, and on the surround∣ing
scene, he looked with tempered plea∣sure
and benevolent satisfaction, while his
son exhibited the gay spirits of youth, an∣ticipating
new delights, and regretless of
those, that were passed.</P>
<P>After near an hour's rowing, the party
landed, and ascended a little path, over∣grown
with vegetation. At a little distance
from the point of the eminence, within the
shadowy recess of the woods, appeared the
pavilion, which Blanche perceived, as she
caught a glimpse of its portico between
the trees, to be built of variegated marble.
As she followed the Countess, she often,
turned her eyes with rapture towards the
ocean, seen beneath the dark foliage, far
below, and from thence upon the deep
<PB N="382" REF="384"/>
woods, whose silence and impenetrable
gloom awakened emotions more solemn,
but scarcely less delightful</P>
<P>The pavilion had been prepared, as far
as was possible, on a very short notice, for
the reception of its visitors; but the faded
colours of its painted walls and ceiling,
and the decayed drapery of its once mag∣nificent
furniture, declared how long it
had been neglected, and abandoned to
the empire of the changing seasons. While
the party partook of a collation of fruit
and coffee, the horns, placed in a distant
part of the woods, where an echo sweetened
and prolonged their melancholy tones,
broke softly on the stillness of the scene.
This spot seemed to attract even the admi∣ration
of the Countess, or, perhaps, it was
merely the pleasure of planning furniture
and decorations, that made her dwell so
long on the necessity of repairing and
adorning it; while the Count, never hap∣pier
than when he saw her mind engaged
by natural and simple objects, acquiesced
<PB N="383" REF="385"/>
in all her designs, concerning the pavilion.
The paintings on the walls and coved
ceiling were to be renewed, the canopies
and sofas were to be of light green da∣mask;
marble statues of wood-nymphs,
bearing on their heads baskets of living
flowers, were to adorn the recesses between
the windows, which, descending to the
ground, were to admit to every part of
the room, and it was of octagonal form,
the various landscape. One window open∣ed
upon a romantic glade, where the eye
roved among woody recesses, and the scene
was bounded only by a lengthened pomp
of groves; from another, the woods reced∣ing
disclosed the distant summits of the
Pyrenées; a third fronted an avenue, be∣yond
which the grey towers of Chateau∣te-Blanc,
and a picture<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>que part of its ruin
were seen partially among the foliage;
while a fourth gave, between the trees, a
glimpse of the green pastures and villages,
that diversify the banks of the Aude. The
Mediterranean, with the bold cliffs, that
<PB N="384" REF="386"/>
overlooked its shores, were the grand ob∣jects
of a fifth window, and the others
gave, in different points of view, the wild
scenery of the woods.</P>
<P>After wandering, for some time, in these,
the party returned to the shore and em∣barked;
and, the beauty of the evening
tempting them to extend their excursion,
they proceeded further up the bay. A
dead calm had succeeded the light breeze,
that wafted them, hither, and the men took
to their oars. Around, the waters were
spread into one vast expanse of polished
mirror, reflecting the grey cliffs and fea∣thery
woods, that over-hung its surface, the
glow of the western horizon and the dark
clouds, that came slowly from the east.
Blanche loved to see the dipping oars im∣print
the water, and to watch the spread∣ing
circles they left, which gave a tremu∣lous
motion to the reflected landscape,
without destroying the harmony of its
features.</P>
<P>Above the darkness of the woods, her
<PB N="385" REF="387"/>
eye now caught a cluster of high towers,
touched with the splendour of the setting
rays; and, soon after, the horns being then,
silent, she heard the faint swell of choral
voices from a distance.</P>
<P>“What voices are those, upon the air?”
said the Count, looking round, and listen∣ing;
but the strain had ceased. “It seem∣ed
to be a vesper-hymn, which I have often
heard in my convent,” said Blanche.</P>
<P>“We are near the monastery, then,”
observed the Count; and, the boat soon
after doubling a lofty head-land, the mo∣nastery
of St. Claire appeared, seated near the margin of the sea, where the cliffs,
suddenly sinking, formed a low shore with∣in
a small bay, almost encircled with
woods, among which partial features of the
edifice were seen;—the great gate and
gothic window of the hall, the cloisters
and the side of a chapel more remote;
while a venerable arch, which had once
led to a part of the fabric, now demolished,
stood a majestic ruin detached from the
<PB N="386" REF="388"/>
main building, beyond which appeared a
grand perspective of the woods. On the
grey walls, the moss had fastened, and,
round the pointed windows of the chapel,
the ivy and the briony hung in many a
fantastic wreath.</P>
<P>All without was silent and forsaken;
but, while Blanche gazed with admiration
on this venerable pile, whose effect was
heightened by the strong lights and sha∣dows
thrown athwart it by a cloudy sun∣set,
a sound of many voices, slowly chant∣ing,
arose from within. The Count bade
his men rest on their oars. The monks
were singing the hymn of vespers, and
some female voices mingled with the strain,
which, rose by soft degrees, till the high
organ and the choral soundsswelled into
full and solemn harmony. The strain,
soon after, dropped into sudden silence, and
was renewed in a low and still more so∣lemn
key, till, at length, the holy chorus
died away, and was heard no more.—
Blanche sighed, tears trembled in her eyes,
<PB N="387" REF="389"/>
and her thoughts seemed wafted with the
founds to heaven. While a rapt stillness
prevailed in the boat, a train of friars, and
then of nuns, veiled in white, issued from
the cloisters, and passed, under the shade
of the woods, to the main body of the edi∣fice.</P>
<P>The Countess was the first of her party
to awaken from this pause of silence.</P>
<P>“These dismal hymns and friars make
one quite melancholy,” said she; “twi∣light
is coming on; pray let us return, or
it will be dark before we get home.”</P>
<P>The Count, looking up, now perceived,
that the twilight of evening was anticipated
by an approaching storm. In the east a
tempest was collecting; a heavy gloom
came on, opposing and contrasting the
glowing splendour of the setting sun. The
clamorous sea-fowl skimmed in sleet cir∣cles
upon the surface of the sea, dipping
their light pinions in the wave, as they fled
away in search of shelter. The boatmen
pulled hard at their oars; but the thunder,
<PB N="388" REF="390"/>
that now muttered at a distance, and the
heavy drops, that began to dimple the water,
made the Count determine to put back to
the monastery for shelter, and the course
of the boat was immediately changed. As
the clouds approached the west, their lurid
darkness changed to a deep ruddy glow,
which, by reflection, seemed to fire the
tops of the woods and the shattered towers
of the monastery.</P>
<P>The appearance of the heavens alarmed
the Countess and Mademoiselle Bearn,
whose expressions of apprehension distressed
the Count, and perplexed his men; while
Blanche continued silent, now agitated
with fear, and now with admiration, as
she viewed the grandeur of the clouds,
and their effect on the scenery, and listened
to the long, long peals of thunder, that
rolled through the air.</P>
<P>The boat having reached the lawn be∣fore
the monastery, the Count sent a ser∣vant
to announce his arrival, and to en∣treat
shelter of the Superior, who, soon
<PB N="389" REF="391"/>
after, appeared at the great gate, attended
by several monks, while the servant return∣ed
with a message, expressive at once of
hospitality and pride, but of pride dis∣guised
in submissiton. The party imme∣diately
disembarked, and, having hastily
crossed the lawn—for the shower was now
heavy—were received at the gate by the Su∣perior,
who, as they entered, stretched forth
his hands and gave his blessing; and they
passed into the great hall, where-the lady
abbess waited, attended by several nuns,
clothed, like herself, in black, and veiled in
white. The veil of the abbess was, how∣ever,
thrown half back, and discovered a
countenance, whose chaste dignity was
sweetened by the sinite of welcome, with
which she addressed the Countess, whom
she led, with Blanche and Mademoiselle
Bearn, into the convent parlour, while the
Count and Henri were conducted by the
Superior to the refectory.</P>
<P>The Countess, fatigued and discontent∣ed,
received the politeness of the abbess
<PB N="390" REF="392"/>
with careless haughtiness, and had follow∣ed
her, with indolent steps, to the parlour,
over which the painted casements and wain∣scot
of larch-wood threw, at all times, a
melancholy shade, and where the gloom of
evening now loured almost to darkness.</P>
<P>While the lady abbess ordered refresh∣ment,
and conversed with the Countess,
Blanche withdrew to a window, the lower
panes of which, being without painting, al∣lowed
her to observe the progress of the
storm over the Mediterranean, whose dark
waves, that had so lately slept, now came
boldly swelling, in long succession, to the
shore, where they burst in white foam, and
threw up a high spray over the rocks. A
red sulphureous tint overspread the long
line of clouds, that hung above the western
horizon, beneath whose dark skirts the sun
looking out, illumined the distant shores
of Languedoc, as well as the tufted sum∣mits
of the nearer woods, and shed a par∣tial
gleam on the we∣tern
waves. The rest of the scene was in deep gloom, ex∣cept
<PB N="391" REF="393"/>
where a sun-beam, darting between
the clouds, glanced on the white wings
of the sea-fowl, that circled high among
them, or touched the swelling sail of a
vessel, which was seen labouring an the
storm. Blanche, for some time, anxiously
watched the progress of the bark, as it
threw the waves in foam around it, and, as
the lightnings flashed, looked to the open∣ing
heavens, with many a sigh for the fate
of the poor mariners.</P>
<P>The sun, at length, set, and the heavy
clouds, which had long impended, drop∣ped
over the splendour of his course; the
vessel, however, was yet dimly seen, and
Blanche continued to observe it, till the
quick succession of flashes, lighting up
the gloom of the whole horizon, warned
her to retire from the window, and she
joined the Abbess, who, having exhausted
all her topics of conversation with the
Countess, had now leisure to notice her.</P>
<P>But their discourse was interrupted by
tremendous peals of thunder; and the
<PB N="392" REF="394"/>
bell of the monastery soon after ringing out,
summoned the inhabitants to prayer. As
Blanche passed the windows, she gave ano∣ther
look to the ocean, where, by the mo∣mentary
flash, that illumined the vast body
of the waters, she distinguished the vessel
she had observed before, amidst a sea of
foam, breaking the billows, the mast now
bowing to the waves, and then rising high
in air.</P>
<P>She sighed fervently as she gazed, and
then followed the Lady Abbess and the
Countess to the chapel. Meanwhile, some of
the Count's servants, having gone by land
to the chateau for carriages, returned soon
after vespers had concluded, when, the
storm being somewhat abated, the Count
and his family returned home. Blanche
was surprised to discover how much the
windings of the shore had deceived her,
concerning the distance of the chateau from
the monastery, whose vesper bell she had
heard, on the preceding evening, from
the windows of the west saloon, and whose
<PB N="393" REF="395"/>
towers she would also have seen from
thence, had not twilight veiled them.</P>
<P>On their arrival at the chateau, the
Countess, affecting more fatigue, than she
really felt, withdrew to her apartment, and
the Count, with his daughter and Henri,
went to▪ the supper-room, where they had
not been long, when they heard, in a
pause of the gust, a firing of guns, which,
the Count understanding to be signals of
distress from some vessel in the storm,
went to a window, that opened towards
the Mediterranean, to observe further;
but the sea was now involved in utter dark∣ness,
and the loud howlings of the tempest
had again overcome every other sound.
Blanche, remembering the bark, which
she had before seen, now joined her father,
with trembling anxiety. In a few mo∣ments,
the report of guns was again borne
along the wind, and as suddenly wafted
away; a tremendous burst of thunder, fol∣lowed
and, in the flash, that had preceded
it, and which seemed to quiver over the
<PB N="394" REF="396"/>
Whole surface of the waters, a vessel was
discovered, tossing amidst the white foam
of the waves at some cistance from the
shore. Impenetrable darkness again in∣volved
the scene, but soon a second flash
shewed the bark, with one sail unfurled,
driving towards the coast. Blanche hung
upon her father's arm, with looks full of
the agony of united terror and pity, which
were unnecessary to awaken the heart of the
Count, who gazed upon the sea with a pi∣teous
expression, and, perceiving, that no
boat could live in the storm, forbore to
send one; but he gave orders to his people
to carry torches out upon the cliffs, hoping
they might prove a kind of beacon to the
vessel, or, at least, warn the crew of the
rocks they were approaching. While
Henri went out todirect on what part of
the cliffs the lights should appear, Blanche
remained, with her father, at the window,
catching, every now and then, as the
lightnings flashed, a glimpse of the vessel;
and she soon saw, with reviving hope, the
<PB N="395" REF="397"/>
torches flaming on the blackness of night,
and, as they waved over the cliffs, casting
a red gleam on the gasping billows. When
the firing of guns was repeated, the torches
were tossed high in the air, as if answer∣ing
the signal, and the firing was then
redoubled; but, though the wind bore
the sound away, she fancied, as the light∣nings
glanced, that the vessel was much
nearer the shore.</P>
<P>The Count's servants were now seen,
running to and fro, on the rocks; some
venturing almost to the point of the crags,
and bending over, held out their torches
fastened to long poles; while others, whose
steps could be traced only by the course of
the lights, descended the steep and dange∣rous
path, that wound to the margin of
the sea, and, with loud halloos, hailed the
mariners, whose shrill whistle, and then
feeble voices, were heard, at intervals,
mingling with the storm. Sudden shouts
from the people on the rocks increased the
anxiety of Blanche to an almost intolerable
degree: but her suspense, concerning the
<PB N="396" REF="398"/>
fate of the mariners, was soon over, when
Henri, running breathless into the room,
told that the vessel was anchored in the bay
below, but in so shattered a condition,
that it was feared she would part before
the crew could disembark. The Count
immediately gave orders for his own boats
to assist in bringing them to shore, and
that such of these unfortunate strangers as
could not be accommodated in the ad∣jacent
hamlet should be entertained at the
chateau. Among the latter, were Emily
St. Aubert, Monsieur Du Pont, Ludovico
and Annette, who, having embarked at
Leghorn and reached Marseilles, were
from thence crossing the Gulf of Lyons,
when this storm overtook them. They
were received by the Count with his usual
benignity, who, though Emily wished to
have proceeded immediately to the monas∣tery
of St. Claire, would not allow her to
leave the chateau, that night; and, indeed,
the terror and fatigue she had suffered
would, scarcely have permitted her to go
farther.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="399"/>
In Monsieur Du Pont the Count disco∣vered
an old acquaintance, and much joy
and congratulation passed between them,
after which Emily was introduced by name
to the Count's family, whose hospitable
benevolence dissipated the little embar∣rassment,
which her situation had occa∣sioned
her, and the party were soon seatecl
at the supper-table. The unaffected kind∣ness
of Blanche and the lively joy she ex∣pressed
on the escape of the strangers, for
whom her pity had been so much interested,
gradually revived Emily's languid spirits;
and Du Pont, relieved from his terrors for
her and for himself, felt the full contrast,
between his late situation on a dark and tre∣mendous
ocean, and his present one, in a
cheerful mansion, where he was surround∣ed
with plenty, elegance and smiles of
welcome.</P>
<P>Annette, meanwhile, in the servants'hall,
was telling of all the dangers she had
encountered, and congratulating herself so
heartily upon her own and Ludovico's escape,
<PB N="398" REF="400"/>
and on her present comforts, that
she often made all that part of the chateau
ring with merriment and laughter. Ludo∣vico's
spirits were as gay as her own, but
he had discretion enough to restrain them,
and tried to check hers, though in vain,
till her laughter, at length, ascended to
<HI>my lady's</HI> chamber, who sent to enquire
what occasioned so much uproar in the
chateau, and to command silence.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew early to seek the repose
she so much required, but her pillow was
long a sleepless one. On this her return
to her native country, many interesting
remembrances were awakened; all the
events and sufferings she had experienced,
since she quitted it, came in long succession
to her fancy, and were chased only by
the image of Valancourt, with whom to
believe herself once more in the same land,
after they had been so long, and so dis∣tantly
separated, gave her emotions of inde∣scribable
joy, but which afterwards yielded
to anxiety and apprehension, when she
<PB N="399" REF="401"/>
considered the long period, that had
elapsed, since any letter had passed be∣tween
them, and how much might have
happened in this interval to affect her fu∣ture
peace. But the thought, that Valan∣court
might be now no more, or, if living,
might have forgotten her, was so very ter∣rible
to her heart, that she would scarcely
suffer herself to pause upon the possibility.
She determined to inform him, on the
following day, of her arrival in France,
which it was scarcely possible he could
know but by a letter from herself, and,
after soothing her spirits with the hope of
soon hearing, that he was well, and un∣changed
in his affections, she, at length,
sunk to repose.</P>

<P>THE Lady Blanche was so much in∣terested
for Emily, that, upon hearing she
was going to reside in the neighbouring
convent, she requested the Count would
invite her to lengthen her stay at the cha∣teau.
“And you know, my dear sir,”
added Blanche, how delighted I shall
be with such a companion; for, at pre∣sent,
I have no friend to walk, or to read
with, since Mademoiselle Bearn is my
mamma's friend only.”</P>
<P>The Count smiled at the youthful sim∣plicity,
with which his daughter yielded to
first impressions; and, though he chose to
warn her of their danger, he silently ap∣plauded
the benevolence, that could thus
readily expand in confidence to a stranger.
<PB N="401" REF="403"/>
He had observed Emily, with attention,
on the preceding evening, and was as
much pleased with her, as it was possible
he could be with any person, on so short
an acquaintance. The mention, made of
her by Mons. Du Pont, had also given
him a favourable impression of Emily;
but, extremely cautious as to those, whom
he introduced to the intimacy of his daugh∣ter,
he determined, on hearing that the
former was no stranger at the convent of
St. Claire, to visit the abbess, and, if her
account corresponded with his wish, to in∣vite
Emily to pass some time at the cha∣teau.
On this subject, he was influenced
by a consideration of the Lady Blanche's
welfare, still more than by either a wish
to oblige her, or to befriend the orphan
Emily, for whom, however, he felt consi∣derably
interested.</P>
<P>On the following morning, Emily was
too much fatigued to appear; but Mons.
Du “Pont was at the breakfast- table, when
the Count entered the room, who pressed
<PB N="402" REF="404"/>
him, as his former acquaintance, and the
son of a very old friend, to prolong his
stay at the chateau; an invitation, which
Du Pont willingly accepted, since it would
allow him to be near Emily; and, though
he was not conscious of encouraging a hope,
that she would ever return his affection,
he had not fortitude enough to attempt, at
present, to overcome it.</P>
<P>Emily, when she was somewhat reco∣vered,
wandered with her new friend over
the grounds belonging to the chateau, as
much delighted with the surrounding views,
as Blanche, in the benevolence of her
heart, had wished; from thence she per∣ceived,
beyond the woods, the towers of
the monastery, and remarked, that it was
to this convent she designed to go.</P>
<P>“Ah!” said Blanche with surprise,
“I. am but just released from a con∣vent,
and would you go into one? If
you could know what pleasure I feel in
wandering here, at liberty,—and in seeing
the sky and the fields, and the woods all
<PB N="403" REF="405"/>
round me, I think you would not.”
Emily, smiling at the warmth, with which
the Lady Blanche spoke, observed, that
she did not mean to confine herself to a
convent for life.</P>
<P>“No, you may not intend it now,”
said Blanche; “but you do not know to
what the nuns may persuade you to con∣sent:
I know how kind they will appear,
and how happy, for I have seen too much
of their art.”</P>
<P>When they returned to the chateau,
Lady Blanche conducted Emily to her
favourite turret, and from thence they
rambled through the ancient chambers,
which Blanche had visited before. Emily
was amused by observing the structure of
these apartments, and the fashion of their
old but stil1 magnificent furniture, and by
comparing them with those of the castle
of Udolpho, which were yet more antique
and grotesque. She was also interested b
Dorothée the house-keeper, who attended▪
whose appearance was almost as an∣ntique
<PB N="404" REF="406"/>
as the objects around her, and who
seemed no less interested by Emily, on
whom she frequently gazed with so much
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leep attention, as scarcely to hear what
was said to her.</P>
<P>While Emily looked from one of the
casements, she perceived, with surprise,
some objects, that were familiar to her me∣mory;
—the fields and woods, with the
gleaming brook, which she had passed with
La Voisin, one evening, soon after the
death of Monsieur Sr. Aubert, in her way
from the monastery to her cottage; and
she now knew this to be the chateau, which
he had then avoided, and concerning which
he had dropped some remarkable hints.</P>
<P>Shocked by this discovery, yet scarcely
knowing why, she mused for some time in
silence, and remembered the emotion,
which her father had betrayed on finding
himself so near this mansion, and some
other circumstances of his conduct, that
now greatly interested her. The music,
too, which she had formerly heard, and,
<PB N="405" REF="407"/>
respecting which La Voisin had given such
an odd account, occurred to her, and, de∣sirous
of knowing more concerning it,
she asked Dorothée whether it returned at mid∣night,
as usual, and whether the musician
had yet been discovered.</P>
<P>“Yes, ma'amselle,” replied Dorothée,
“that music is still heard, but the musi∣cian
has never been found out, nor ever
will, I believe; though there are some
people, who can guess.”</P>
<P>“Indeed!” said Emily, “then why do
they not pursue the enquiry?”</P>
<P>“Ah, young lady! enquiry enough has
been made—but who can pursue a spirit?”</P>
<P>Emily smiled, and, remembering how
lately she had suffered herself to be led
away by superstition, determined now to
resist its contagion; yet, in spight of her
efforts, she felt awe mingle with her curio∣sity,
on this subject; and Blanche, who
had hitherto listened in silence, now en∣quired
what this music was, and how long
it had been heard.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="408"/>
“Ever since the death of my lady,
madam,“replied Dorothée.</P>
<P>“Why, the place is not haunted, sure∣ly?”
said Blanche, between jesting and
seriousness.</P>
<P>“I have heard that music almost ever
since my dear lady died,” continued Do∣rothée,
“and never before then. But that
is nothing to some things I could tell of.”</P>
<P>“Do, pray, tell them, then,” said Lady
Blanche, now more in earnest than in jest.</P>
<P>“I am much interested, for I have heard
sister Henriette, and sister Sophie, in the
convent, tell of such strange appearances,
which they themselves had witnessed!”</P>
<P>“You never heard, my lady, I suppose,
what made us leave the chateau, and go
and live in a cottage,” said Dorothée.
“Never!” replied Blanche with impatience.</P>
<P>“Nor the reason, that my lord, the
Marquis”—Dorothée checked herself, he∣sitated,
and then endeavoured to change
the topic; but the curiosity of Blanche
was too much awakened to suffer the sub∣ject
<PB N="407" REF="409"/>
thus easily to escape her, and she
pressed the old house-keeper to proceed
with her account, upon whom, however,
no entreaties could prevail; and it was
evident, that she was alarmed for the im∣prudence,
into which she had already be∣trayed
herself.</P>
<P>“I perceive,” said Emily, smiling,
that all old mansions are haunted; I am
lately come from a place of wonders; but
unluckily, since I left it, I have heard al∣most
all of them explained.”</P>
<P>Blanche was silent; Dorothée looked
grave, and sighed; and Emily felt herself
still inclined to believe more of the won∣derful,
than she chose to acknowledge.
Just then, she remembered the spectacle
she had witnessed in a chamber of Udolpho,
and, by an odd kind of coincidence, the
alarming words, that had accidentally met
her eye in the MS. papers, which she had
destroyed, in obedience to the command
of her father; and she shuddered at the
meaning they seemed to impart, almost as
<PB N="408" REF="410"/>
much as at the horrible appearance, dis∣closed
by the black veil.</P>
<P>The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, unable
to prevail with Dorothée to explain the
subject of her late hints, had desired, on
reaching the door, that terminated the gal∣lery,
and which she found fastened on
the preceding day, to see the suite of rooms
beyond. “Dear young lady,” said the
housekeeper, ” I have told you my reason
for not opening them; I have never seen
them, since my dear lady died; and it
would go hard with me to see them now.
Pray, madam, do not ask me again ”</P>
<P>“Certainly 1 will not,” replied Blanche,
“if that is really your objection.”</P>
<P>“Alas! it is,” said the old woman:
we all loved her well, and I shall always
grieve for her. Time runs round! it is
now many years, since she died; but I re∣member
every thing, that happened then,
as if it was but yesterday. Many things,
that have-passed of late years, are gone
quite from my memory, while those so
<PB N="409" REF="411"/>
long ago, I can see as if in a glass.” She
paused, but afterwards, as they walked up
the gallery, added of Emily, “This young
lady sometimes brings the late Marchioness
to my mind; I can remember, when she
looked just as blooming, and very like her,
when she smiles. Poor lady! how gay
she was, when she first came to the cha∣teau!”</P>
<P>“And was she not gay, afterwards?”
said Blanche.</P>
<P>Dorothée shook her head; and Emily
observed her, with eyes strongly expres∣sive
of the interest she now felt. “Let
us sit down in this window,” said the Lady
Blanche, on reaching the opposite end of
the gallèry: “and pray, Dorothée, if it is
not painful to you, tell us something more
about the Marchioness. I should like to
look into the glass you spoke of just now,
and see a few of the circumstances, which
you say often pass over it.”</P>
<P>“No, my lady,” replied Dorothée;
“if you knew as much as I do, you would
<PB N="410" REF="412"/>
not, for you would find there a dismal
train of them; I often wish I could shut
them out, but they will rise to my mind.
I see my dear lady on her death-bed,—her
very look,—and remember all she said—it
was a terrible, scene!”</P>
<P>“Why was it so terrible?” said Emily
with emotion.</P>
<P>“Ah, dear young lady! is not death
always terrible?” replied Dorothée.</P>
<P>To some further enquiries of Blanche
Doroth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was silent; and Emily, observing
the tears in her eyes, forbore to urge the
subject, and endeavoured to withdraw the
attention of her young friend to some ob∣ject
in the gardens, where the Count, with
the Countess and Monsieur Du Pont, ap∣pearing,
they went down to join them.</P>
<P>When he perceived Emily, he advanced
to meet her, and presented her to the
Counteis, in a manner so benign, that it
recalled most powerfully to her mind the
idea of her late father, and she felt more
gratitude to him, than embarrassment to∣wards
<PB N="411" REF="413"/>
the Countess, who, however, receiv∣ed
her with one of those fascinating smiles,
which her caprice sometimes allowed her
to assume, and which were now the result
of a conversation the Count had held with
her, concerning Emily. Whatever this
might be, or whatever had passed in his
conversation with the lady abbess, whom
he had just visited, esteem and kindness
were strongly apparent in his manner,
when he addressed Emily, who experienced
that sweet emotion, which arises from the
consciousness of possessing the approbation
of the good; for to the Count's worth she
had been inclined to yield her confidence
almost from the first moment, in which she
had seen him.</P>
<P>Before she could finish her acknowledg∣ments
for the hospitality she had received,
and mention, her design of going imme∣diately
to the convent, she was interrupted
by an invitation to lengthen her stay at the
chateau, which was pressed by the Count and the
with, an appearance of
<PB N="412" REF="414"/>
such friendly sincerity, that, though she
much wished to see her old friends at the
monastery, and to sigh, once more, over
her father's grave, she consented to remain
a few days at the chateau.</P>
<P>To the abbess, however, she immedi∣ately
wrote, mentioning her arrival in
Languedoc and her wish to be received
into the convent, as a boarder; she also
sent letters to Monsieur Quesnel and to
Valancourt, whom she merely informed of
her arrival in France; and, as she knew
not where the latter might be stationed,
she directed her letter to his brother's seat
in Gascony.'</P>
<P>In the evening, Lady Blanche and Monf.
Du Pont walked with Emily to the cottage
of La Voifin, which she had now a melan∣choly
pleasure in approaching, for time
had softened her grief for the loss of St.
Aubert, though it could not annihilate it,
and she felt a soothing sadness in indulg∣ing
the recollections, which this scene re∣called.
La Voisin was still living, and
<PB N="413" REF="415"/>
seemed to enjoy, as much as formerly, the
tranquil evening of a blameless life. He
was sitting at the door of his cottage,
watching some of his grand-children, play∣ing
on the grass before him, and, now and
then, with a laugh, or a commendation,
encouraging their sports. He immediately
recollected Emily, whom he was much
pleased to see, and she was as rejoiced
to hear, that he had not lost one of his fa∣mily,
since her departure.</P>
<P>“Yes, ma'amselle,” said the old man,
“we all live merrily together still, thank
God! and I believe there is not a happier
family to be found in Languedoc, than
ours.”</P>
<P>Emily did not trust herself in the cham∣ber,
where St. Aubert died; and, after
half an hour's conversation with La Voisin
and his. family, she left the cottage.</P>
<P>During these the first days of her stay at
Chateau; le-Blanc, she was often affected,
by observing the deep, but silent melan∣choly,
which, at times, stole over Du Pont;
<PB N="414" REF="416"/>
and Emily pitying the self-delusion, which
disarrned him of the will to depart, de∣termined
to withdraw herself as soon as the
respect she owed the Count and Gountess
De Villesort would permit. The dejection
of his friend soon alarmed the anxiety of
the Count, to whom Du Pont, at length,
confided the secret of his hopeless affec∣tion,
which, however, the former could
only cormmiserate, though he secretly de∣termined
to befriend his suit, if an oppor∣tunity
of doing so should ever occur. Con∣fidering
the dangerous situation of Du
Pont, he but feebly opposed his intention
of leaving Chateau-le-Blanc, on the fol∣lowing
day, but drew from him a promise
of a longer visit, when he could return
with safety to his peace. Emily herself,
though she could not encourage his affec∣tion,
esteemed him both for the many vir∣tues
he possessed, and for the services she
had received from him; and it was not without tender emotions of gratitude and
pity, that the now saw him depart for his
<PB N="415" REF="417"/>
famiy seat in Gascony; while he took
leave of her with a countenance so expres∣sive
of love and grief, as to interest the
Count more warmly in his. cause than be∣fore.
In a few days, Emily also left the cha∣teau,
but not before the Count and Coun∣tess
had received her promise to repeat her
visit very soon; and she was welcomed by
the abbess, with the same maternal kindness
she had formerly experienced, and by the
nuns, with much expression of regard. The
well-known scenes of the convent occa∣sioned
her many melancholy recollections, but with these were mingled-others, that
inspired gratitude for having escaped the
various dangers, that had pursued her,
since she quitted it, and for the good,
which she yet possessed; and, though she
once more wept over her father's grave,
with tears of tender affection, her grief was
sostened from its former acuteness.</P>
<P>Some time after her return to the monat∣stery,
<PB N="416" REF="418"/>
she received a letter from her uncle,
Monf. Quesnel, in answer to information
that she had arrived in France, and to
her enquiries, concerning such of her af∣fairs
as he had undertaken to conduct dur∣ing
her absence, especially as to the period
for which La Vallée had been let, whither
it was her with to return, if it should ap∣pear,
that her income would permit her to
do so. The reply of Monf. Quesnel was
cold and formal, as she expected, express∣ing
neither concern for, the evils she susfered,
nor-pleasure, that she was now re∣moved
from them; nor did he allow the
opportunity to pass, of reproving her for her rejection of Count Morano, whom he
affected still to believe a man of honour
and fortune; nor of vehemently declaim∣ing
against Montoni, to whom he had al∣ways,
till now, felt himself to be inferior.
On Emily's pecuniary concerns, he was not
very explicit; he informed her, however, that the term, for which La Vallée liad
<PB N="417" REF="419"/>
been engaged, was nearly expired; but, without inviting her to his own house, added, that her circumstances would by no means allow her to reside there, and ear∣neftly
advised her to remain, for the pre∣sent,
in the convent of St. Claire.</P>
<P>To her enquiries, respecting poor old Theresa, her late father's servant, he gave
no answer. In the postscript to his letter, Monsieur Quesnel mentioned M. Motte∣ville,
in whose hands the late St. Aubert had placed the chief of his personal pro∣perty,
as being likely to arrange his affairs nearly to the satisfaction of his creditors,
and that Emily would recover much more
of her fortune, than she had formerly rea∣son to expect. The letter also inclosed to
Emily an order upon a merchant at Nar∣bonne,
for a small sum of money.</P>
<P>The tranquillity of the monastery, and the liberty she was suffered to enjoy, in
wandering among the woods and shores of
this delightful province, gradually restored
<PB N="418" REF="420"/>
her spirits to their natural tone, except
that anxiety would sometimes intrude,
concerning Valancourt, as the time ap∣proached,
when it was possible that she
might receive an answer to her letter.</P>

<P>THE Lady Blanche, meanwhile, who
was left much alone, became impatient
for the company of her new friend, whom
she wished to observe sharing in the de∣light
she received from the beautiful scen∣ery
around. She had now no person, to
whom she could express her admiration
and coommunicate her pleasures, no eye,
that sparkled to her smile, or countenance,
that reflected her happiness; and she be∣came
spiritless and pensive. The Count,
observing her dissatisfaction readily yield∣ed
to her entreaties, and reminded Emily
of her promised visit but the silence of
<PB N="420" REF="422"/>
Valancourt, which was now prolonged far
beyond the period, when a letter might
have arrived from Estuviere, oppressed
Emily with severe anxiety, and, rendering
her averse to society, she would willingly
have deferred her acceptance of this invi∣tation,
till her spirits should be relieved.
The Count and his family, however, pres∣sed
to see her; and, as the circumstances,
that prompted her wish for solitude, could
not be explained, there was an appearance
of caprice in her refusal, which she could
not persevere in, without offending the
friends, whose esteem she valued. At
length, therefore, she returned upon a se∣cond
visit to Chateau-le-Blanc. Here the
friendly manner of Count De Villefort en∣couraged
Emily to mention to him her situ∣ation,
respecting the estates of her late
aunt, and to consult him on the means of
recovering them. He had little doubt,
that the law would decide in her favour,
and, advising her to apply to it, offered
first to write to an advocate at Avignon,
<PB N="421" REF="423"/>
on whose opinion he thought he could
rely. His kindness was gratefully accepted by Emily, who, soothed by the courtesy she
daily experienced, would have been once
more happy, could she have been assured
of Valancourt's welfare and unaltered af∣fection.
She had now been above a week
at the chateau, without receiving intelli∣gence
of him, and, though she knew, that,
if he was absent from his brother's residence,
it was scarcely probable her letter had yet
reached him, she could not forbear to ad∣mit
doubts and fears, that destroyed her
peace. Again she would consider of all,
that might have happened in the long pe∣riod,
since her first seclusion at Udolpho,
and her mind was sometimes so over∣whelmed
with an apprehension, that Va∣lancourt
was no more, or that he lived no
longer for her, that the company even of
Blanche became intolerably oppressive, and
she would sit alone in herapartment for hours together, when the engagements of the fami∣ly
allowed her to do so, without incivility.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="424"/>
In one of these solitary hours; she un∣locked
a little box, which contained some letters of Valarncourt, with some drawings
she had Sketched, during her stay in Tuf∣cany,
the latter of which were no longer
interesting to her; but, in the letters, she
now, with melancholy indulgence, meant
to retrace the tenderness, that had so often
soothed her, and rendered her, for a mo∣ment,
insensible of the distance, which fe∣parated
her from the writer. But their
effect was now changed; the affection they
expressed appealed, so forcibly to her heart,
when she considered that it had, perhaps,
yielded to the powers of time and absence,
and even the view of the hand-writing re∣called
so many painful recollections, that
she found herself unable to go through
the first she had opened, and sat musing,
with her cheek resting on her arm, and
tears stealing from her eyes, when old
Dorothée entered the room to inform her, that dinner would be ready, an hour be∣fore
the usual time. Emily started on per∣ceiving
<PB N="423" REF="425"/>
her, and hastily put up the pa∣pers,
but not before Dorothée, had ob∣served
both her agitation and her tears.</P>
<P>“Ah, ma'amselle!” said she, “you,
who are so young,—have you reason for
sorrow?”</P>
<P>Emily tried to smile, but was unable to
speak.</P>
<P>“Alas! dear young lady, when you
come to my age, you will not weep at
trisles; and surely you have nothing seri∣ous,
to grieve you.”</P>
<P>“No, Dorothée, nothing of any conse∣quence,”
replied Emily. Dorothée, now
stooping to pick up something, that had
dropped from among the papers, sudden∣ly
exclaimed, “Holy Mary! what is it
I see?” and then, trembling, sat down in
a chair, that stood by the table.</P>
<P>“What is it you do see?” said Emily,
alarmed by her manner, and looking round
the room.</P>
<P>“It is herself,” said Dorothée, “her very
<PB N="424" REF="426"/>
self! just as she looked a little before she died!”</P>
<P>Emily, still more alarmed, began how
to sear, that Dorothée was seized with sud∣den
phrensy, but entreated her to explain herself.</P>
<P>“That picture!' said she, ”where
did you find it, lady? it is my blessed
mistress; herself!”</P>
<P>She laid, on the table the miniature,
which Emily had long ago found among
the papers her father had enjoined her to
destroy, and over which she had once
seen him shed such tender and affecting
tears; and, recollecting all the various
circumstances of his conduct, that had
long perplexed her, her emotions in∣creased
to an excess, which deprived her
of all power to ask the questions she trem∣bled
to have answered, and she could
only enquire, whether Dorothée was cer∣tain
the picture resembled the late Mar∣chioness.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="427"/>
“O, ma'amselle! said she, how came
it to strike me so, the instant I saw it, if it
was not my lady's likeness? Ah!” added
she, taking up the miniature, “these are
her own blue eyes—looking so sweet and so mild; and there is her very? look, such
as I have often seen it, when she had sat
thinking for a long while, and then, the
tears would often steal down her cheeks—
but she never would complain! It was
that look so meek, as it were, and resign∣ed,
that used to break my heart and make
me love her so!”</P>
<P>“Dorothée!” said Emily solemnly, I
am interested in the cause of that grief,
more so, perhaps, than you may imagine;
and I entreat, that you will no longer re∣fuse
to indulge my curiosity;—it is not a
common one.”</P>
<P>As Emily said this, she remembered the
papers, with which the picture had been
found, and had scarcely a doubt, that
they had concerned the Marchioness de
Villeroi; but with this supposition came a
<PB N="426" REF="428"/>
scruple, whether she ought to enquire
further on a subject, which might prove
to be the same, that her father had so
carefully endeavoured to conceal. Her
curiosity, concerning the Marchioness,
powerful as it was, it is probable she would
now have resisted, as she had formerly
done, on unwarily observing the few ter∣rible
words in the papers, which had never since been erased from her memory, had
she been certain that the history of that
lady was the subject of those papers, or,
that such simple particulars only as it was
probable Dorothée could relate were in∣cluded
in her father's command. What
was known to her could be no secret to
many other persons; and, since-it appear∣ed
very unlikely, that St. Aubert should
attempt to conceal what Emily might
learn by ordinary means, she at length
Concluded, that, if the papers had related to
the story of the Marchioness, it was not
those circumstances of it, which Dorothée
could disclose, that he had thought suf∣ficiently
<PB N="427" REF="429"/>
siciently important to wish to have con∣cealed.
She, therefore, no longer hesitated
to make the enquiries, that might lead to
the gratification of her curiosty.</P>
<P>“Ah, ma'amselle!” said Dorothée, ” it
is a sad story, and cannot be told now:
but what am I saying? I never will tell it.
Many years have passed, since it happen∣ed
and I never loved to talk of the Mar∣chioiness
to any body, but my husband.
He lived in the family, at that time, as
well as myself, and he knew many particu∣lars
from me, which nobody else did; for
I was about the person of my lady in her
last illness, and saw and heard as much,
or more than my lord himself. Sweet
saint! how patient she was! When she
died, I thought I could have died with
her!”</P>
<P>“Dorothée,” said Emily. interrupting
her, what you shall tell, you may de∣pend
upon it, shall never be disclosed by
me. 1 have, I repeat it, particular rea∣sons
for-wishing to be informed on this
<PB N="428" REF="430"/>
subject, and am willing to bind myself,
in the most solemn manner, never to men∣tion
what you shall with me to conceal”</P>
<P>Dorothée seemed surprised at the ear∣nestness
of Emily's manner, and, after
regarding her for some moments, in silence,
said, “Young lady! that look of yours
pleads for you—it is so like my dear mis∣tress's,
that I can almost fancy I see her
before me; if you were her daughter, you
could not remind me of her more. But
dinner will be ready—had you not better
go down?”</P>
<P>“You will first promise to grant my
request,” said Emily</P>
<P>“And ought not you first to tell me,
ma'amselle, how this picture fell into your
hands, and the reasons you say you have
for curiosity about my lady?”</P>
<P>“Why, no, Dorothée, replied Emily,
recollecting herself, “I have also particu∣lar
reasons for observing silence, on these
subjects, at least, till I know further; and,
remember, I do not promise ever to speak
<PB N="429" REF="431"/>
upon them; therefore, do not let me in∣duce
you to satisfy my curiosity, from an
expectation, that I shall gratify yours;
What I may judge proper to conceal, does
not concern myself alone, or I should have
less scruple in revealing it: let a confi∣dence
in my honour alone persuade you to
disclose what I request.”</P>
<P>“Well, lady!” replied Dorothée, after
a long pause, during which her eyes were
fixed upon Emily, “you seem so much
interested,—and this picture and that face
of yours make me think you have some
reason to be so,—that I will trust you—
and tell some things, that I never told before
to any body, but my husband, though there
are people, who have suspected as much.
I will tell you the particulars of my lady's
death, too, and some of my own sulps∣cions;
but you must first promise me by
all the saints”—</P>
<P>Emily, interrupting her, solemnly pro∣mised
never to reveal what should be con∣fided
to her, without Dorothée's consent.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="432"/>
“But there is the horn, ma'amselle,
sounding for dinner,” said Dorothée; “I
must be gone.”</P>
<P>“When shall I see you again?” enquired
Emily.</P>
<P>Dorothée muled, and then replied,
“Why, madam, it may make people
curious, if it is known I am so much in
your apartment, and- that I hould be forry for; so I will come when I am least likely
to be observed. I have little leisure in the
day, and I shall have a good deal to say
Co, if you please, ma'am, I will come, when
the family are all in bed.”</P>
<P>“That will suit me very well,” replied
Emily: “Remember, then, to-night”—</P>
<P>“Aye, that is well remembered,” said
Dorothée, “I fear 1 cannot come to∣night,
madam, for there will be the
dance of the vintage, and it will be late,
before the servants go to rest; for, when
they once set. in to dance, they will keep it
up, in the cool of the air, till morning;
at least, it used to beso in my time.”</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="433"/>
“Ah! is it the dance of the vintage?”
said Emily, with a deep sigh, remember∣ing,
that it was on the evening of this
festival, in the preceding year, that St.
Aubert and herself had arrived in the
neighbourhood of Chateau-le-Blanc. She
paused a moment, overcome by the sud∣den
recollection, and then, recovering her∣self,
added—“But this dance is in the
open woods; you, therefore, will not be
wanted, and can easily come to me.”</P>
<P>Dorothée replied, that she had been ac∣customed
to be present at the dance of the
vintage, and she did not wish to be absent
now; “but if I can get away, madam, I
will,” said she.</P>
<P>Emily then hastened to the dining-room,
where the Count conducted himself with
the courtesy, which is inseparable from
true dignity, and of which the Countess
frequently practised little, though her-man∣ner
to Emily was an exception to her usual
habit. But, if she retained few of the or∣namental
virtues, The cherished other qua∣lities,
<PB N="432" REF="434"/>
which she seemed to consider invalu∣able.
She had dismis sed the graceof mo∣desty,
but then she knew perfectly well
how to manage the stare of as surance; her
manners had little of the tempered sweet∣ness,
which is necessary to render the fe∣male
character interesting, but she could
occasionally throw into them an affectation
of spirits, which seemed to triumph over
every person, who approached her. In the
country, however, she generally affected
an elegant languor, that persuaded her al∣most
to faint, when her favourite read to
her a story of fictitious sorrow; but her coun∣tenance
suffered no change, when living ob∣jects
of distress solicited her charity, and
her heart beat with no transport to the
thought of giving them instant relief;—she
was a stranger to the highest luxury, of
which, perhaps, the human mind can be
sensible, for her benevolence had never yet
called smiles upon the face of misery.</P>
<P>In the evening, the Count, with all his
Family, except the Countess and Mademoi∣selle
<PB N="433" REF="435"/>
Bearn, went to the woods to witness the
festivity of the peasants. The scene was
in a glade, where the trees, opening, form∣ed
a circle round the turf they highly over∣shadowed;
between their branches, vines,
loaded with ripe clusters, were hung in
gay festoons; and, beneath, were tables,
with fruit, wine, cheese and other rural
fare,—and seats for the Count and his fa∣mily.
At a little distance, were benches
for the elder peasants, few of whom, how∣ever,
could forbear to join the jocund dance,
which began soon after sun-set, when seve∣ral
of sixty tripped it with almost as much
glee and airy lightness, as those of sixteen.</P>
<P>The musicians, who sat carelesly on the
grass, at the foot of a tree, seemed in∣spired
by the found of their own instru∣ments,
which were chiefly flutes and a
kind of long guitar. Behind stood a
boy, flourishing a tamborine, and dancing
a solo, except that, as he sometimes gaily
tossed the instrument, he tripped among
the other dancers, when his antic gestures
<PB N="434" REF="436"/>
called forth a broader laugh, and heighten∣ed
the rustic spirit of the scene.
The Count was highly delighted with
the happiness he witnessed, to which his
bounty had largely contributed, and the
Lady Blanche joined the dance with a
young gentleman of her father's party.
Du Pont requested Emily's hand, but her
spirits were too much depressed, to permit
her to engage in the present festivity, which
called to her remembrance that of the pre∣ceding
year, when St. Aubert was living,
and of the melancholy scenes, which, had
immediately followed it.</P>
<P>Overcome by these recollections, she, at
length, left the spot, and walked slowly
into the woods, where the softened music,
floating at a distance, soothed her melan∣choly
mind. The moon threw a mellow
light among the foliage; the air was balmy
and cool, and Emily, lost in thought,
strolled on, without observing whither, till
she perceived the sounds sinking afar off,
and an awful stillness round her, except
<PB N="435" REF="437"/>
that, sometimes, the nightingale beguiled
the silence with
<Q>“Liquid notes,'that close the eye of day.”</Q></P>
<P>At length, she found herself near the
avenue, which, on the night of her father's
arrival, Michael had attempted to pass in
strarch of a house, which was still nearly as
wild and desolate as it had then appeared;
for the Count had been so much engaged
in directing other improvements, that he
had neglected to give orders, concerning
this extensive approach, and the road was
yet broken, and the trees overloaded with
their own luxuriance.</P>
<P>As she stood surveying it, and remem∣bering
the emotions, which she had for∣merly
suffered there, she suddenly recol∣lected
the figure, that had been seen steal∣ing
among the trees, and which had re∣turned
no answer to Michael's repeated
calls; and she experienced somewhat of
the fear, that had then assailed her, for it
did not appear improbable, that these deep
<PB N="436" REF="438"/>
woods were occasionally the haunt of ban∣ditti.
She, therefore, turned back, and
was hastily pursuing her way to the dancers,
when she heard steps approaching from the
avenue; and, being still beyond the call
of the peasants on the green, for she could
neither hear their voices, or their music,
she quickened her pace; but the persons
following gained fast upon her, and, at
length, distinguishing the voice of Henri,
she walked leisurely, till he came up. He
expressed some surprise at meeting her so
far from the company; and, on her say∣ing,
that the pleasant moon-light had be∣guiled
her to walk farther than slie in∣tended,
an exclamation burst from the
lips of his companion, and slie thought she
heard Valancourt speak! It was, indeed,
he! and the meeting was such as may be
imagined, between persons so affectionate,
and so long Separated as they had been.</P>
<P>In the joy of these moments, Emily
forgot all her past sufferings, and Valan∣court
seemed to have forgotten, that any
<PB N="437" REF="439"/>
person but Emily existed; while <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
was a silent and astonished spectator of the
scene.</P>
<P>Valancourt asked a thousand questions,
concerning herself and Montoni, which
there was now no time to answer; but she
learned, that her letter had been forwarded
to him, at Paris, which he had previously
quitted, and was returning to Gascony, whither the letter also returned, which, at
length, informed him of Emily's arrival,
and on the receipt of which he had im∣mediately
set out for Languedoc. On reaching the monastery, whence she had dated her letter, he found, to his extreme
disappointment, that the gates were already
closed for the night; and believing, that
he should not see Emily, till the morrow,
he was returning to his little inn, with the
intention of writing to her, when he was
overtaken by Henri, with whom he had
been intimate at Paris, and was led to her,
whom he was secretly lamenting that he
should not see, till the following day.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="440"/>
Emily, with Valancourt and Henri, now
returned to the green, where the latter pre∣tented
Valancourt to the Count, who, she
fancied, received him with less than his
usual benignity, though it appeared, that
they were nor strangers to each other.
He was invited, however, to partake of the
diversions of the evening; and, when he
had paid his respects to the Count, and
while the dancers continued their festivity,
he seated himself by Emily, and conversed,
without constraint. The lights, which were
hung among the trees, under which they
sat, allowed her a more perfect view of
the countenance she had so frequently in
absence endeavoured to recollect and she
perceived, with some regret, that it was
not she same as when last she saw it.
There was all its wonted intelligence and
fire; but it had lost much of the simpli∣city,
and somewhat of the open benevo∣lence,
that used to characterise it. Still,
however, it was an interesting counte∣nance;
but Emily thought she perceived,
<PB N="439" REF="441"/>
at intervals, anxiety contract, and me∣lancholy
six the features of Valancourt;
sometimes, too, he fell into a momen∣tary
musing, and then appeared anxious
to dissipate thought; while, at others,
as he fixed his eyes on Emily, a kind of
sudden distraction seemed to cross his
mind. In her he perceived the same good∣ness
and beautifuls implicity, that had
charmed him, on their first acquaintance.
The bloom of her countenance was some∣what
faded, but all its sweetness remained,
and it was rendered more interesting, than
ever, by the faint expression of melancholy,
that sometimes mingled with her smile.</P>
<P>At his request, she related the most im∣portant
circumstances, that had occurred
to her, since she left France, and emotions
of pity and indignation alternately pre∣vailed
in his mind, when he heard how
much she had suffered from the villany of
Montoni. More than once, when she was
speaking of his conduct, of which the
guilt was rather sstened, than exaggerated,
<PB N="440" REF="442"/>
by her representation, he started from his
seat; and walked away, apparently over∣come
as much by self accusation as by re∣sentment.
Her sufferings alone were men∣tioned
in the few words, which he could
address to her, and he listened not to the
account, which she was careful to give as
distinctly as possible, of the present loss of
Madame Montoni's estates, and of the lit∣tle
reason there was to expect their resto∣ration.
At length, Valancourt remained
lost in thought, and then some secret cause
seemed to overcome him with anguish.
Again he abruptly left her. When he
returned, she perceived, that he had been
weeping, and tenderly begged, that he
would compose himself. “My sufferings
are all passed now,” said she, “for I have
escaped from the tyranny of Montoni, and
I see you well—let me also see you happy.”</P>
<P>Valancourt was more agitated, than be∣fore.
“I am unworthy of you, Emily,”
said he, “I am unworthy of you;”—
words, by his manner of uttering which
<PB N="441" REF="443"/>
Emily was then more shocked than by their
import. She fixed on him a mournful and
enquiring eye. “Do not look thus on
me,” said he, turning away and pressing
her hand; “I cannot bear those looks.”</P>
<P>“I would ask,” said Emily, in a gentle,
but agitated voice, “the meaning of your
words; but I perceive, that the question
would distress you now. Let us talk on
other subjects. To-morrow, perhaps, you
may be more composed. Observe those
moon light woods, and the towers, which
appear obscurely in the perspective. You
used to be a great admirer of landscape,
and I have heard you say, that the faculty
of deriving consolation, under misfortune,
from the sublime prospects, which neither
oppression, or poverty with-hold from us,
was the peculiar blessing of the innocent.”
Valancourt was deeply affected.
“Yes,” replied he, “I had once a taste for inno∣cent
and elegant delights—I had once an
uncorrupted heart.” Then, checking him∣self,
<PB N="442" REF="444"/>
he added, “Do you remember our
journey together in the Pyrenées?”</P>
<P>“Can I forget it?” said Emily.—
“Would that I could!” he replied;—
“that was the happiest period of my life.
I then loved, with enthusiasm, whatever
was truly great, or good.” It was some
time before Emily could repress her tears,
and try to command her emotions. “If you
wish to forget that journey,” said she, “it
must certainly be my wish to forget it
also.” She paused, and then added, ” You
make me very uneasy; but this is not the
time for further enquiry;—yet, how can I
“bear to believe, even for a moment, that
you are less worthy of my esteem than
formerly? I have still sufficient confidence
in your candour, to believe, that, when I
shall ask for an explanation, you will give
it me.“—“Yes,” said Valancourt, “yes,
Emily: I have not yet lost my candour:
if I had, I could better have disguised my
emotions, on learning what were your suf∣ferings
<PB N="443" REF="445"/>
—your virtues,—while I—I—but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
will say no more. I did not mean to have
said even so much—I have been surprised
into the self-accusation. Tell me, Emily,
that you will not forget that journey—will
not wish to forget it, and I will be calm.
1 would not lose the remembrance of it
for the whole earth,”</P>
<P>“How contradictory is this!” said
Emily;—“but we may be over-heard.
My recollection, of it shall depend upon
yours; I will endeavour to forget, or to
recoilect it, as you may do. Let us join
the Count.—“Tell me, first, said Valan∣oourt.”
that you forgive the uneasiness I
have occasioned you, this evening, and that
you will still love me.—“I sincerely for∣give
you, replied Emily.” You best
know whether I shall continue to love you,
for you know whether you deserve my
esteem. At present, I will believe that
you do. It is unnecessary to say,” added
she, observing his dejection, “how much
pain it would give me to believe other∣wife.
<PB N="444" REF="446"/>
—The young lady, who approaches,
is the Count's daughter.”</P>
<P>Valancourt and Emily now joined the
Lady Blanche; and the party, soon after,
sat down with the Count, his son, and the
Chevalier Du Pont, at a banquet, spread
under a gay awoing, beneath the trees.
At the table also were seated several of the
most venerable of the Count's tenants, and
it was a festive repast to all but Valancourt
and Emily. When the Count retired to
the chateau, he did not invite Valan court
to accompany him, who, therefore, took
leave of Emily, and retired to his solitary
inn for the night: meanwhile, she soon
withdrew to her own apartment, where she
mused, with deep anxiety and concern, on
his behaviour, and on the Count's recep∣tion
of him. Her attention was thus so
wholly engaged, that ihe forgot Dorothse
and her appointment,: till morning was
far advanced, when, knowing that the
good old Woman would not come, she re∣tired,
for a few hours, to repose.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="447"/>
On the following day, when the Count
had accidentally joined Emily in one of
the walks, they talked of the festival of
the preceding evening, and this led him
to a mention of Valancourt. “That is a
young man of talents,” said he; “you
were formerly acquainted with him, I per∣ceive.”
Emily said, that she was. “He
was introduced to me, at Paris,” said the
Count, “and I was much pleased with
him, on our first acquaintance.” He paus∣ed,
and Emily trembled, between the de∣sire
of hearing more and the fear of shew∣ing
the Count, that she felt an interest on
the subject. “May I ask,” said he, at
length, “how long you have known Mon∣sieur
Valancourt?—“Will you allow me
to ask your reason for the question, sir?” said she; “and I will answer it immedi∣ately,—Certainly,”
said the Count,
“that is but just. I will tell you my rea∣son.
I cannot but perceive, that Monsieur
Valancourt admires you; in that, how∣ever,
there is nothing extraordinary; every
<PB N="446" REF="448"/>
person, who sees you, must do the same,
I am above using common-place compli∣ments;
I; speak with sincerity. What I
fear, is, that he is a favoured admirer.”—
—“Why do you fear it, sir?” said Emily,
endeavouring to conceal her emotion.—
“Because,” replied the Count, “I think
him not worthy of your favour.” Emily,
greatly agitated, entreated further explana∣tion.
“I will give it,” said he, “if you
will believe; that nothing but a strong in∣terest
in your welfare could induce me to
hazard that affertion.”—“I must believe
so, sir,” replied Emily.</P>
<P>“But let us rest under these trees,” said
the Count, observing the paleness of her
countenance; “here is a seat—you are
fatigued.” They sat down, and the Count
proceeded. “Many young ladies, cir∣cumstanced
as you are, would think my
conduct, on this occasion;' and on so short
an acquaintance, impertinent, instead of
friendly; from what I have observed of
your temper and understanding, I do not
<PB N="447" REF="449"/>
fear such a return from you. Our ac∣quaintance
has been short, but long
enough to make me esteem you, and feel a
lively interest in your happiness. You de∣serve
to be very happy, and I trust that
you will be so.” Emily sighed softly, and
bowed her thanks. The Count paused
again. “I am unpleasantly circumstanced,”
said he; “but an opportunity of rendering
you important service shall overcome infe∣rior
conslderations. Will you inform me
of the manner of your first acquaintance
with the Chevalier Valancourt, if the sub∣ject
is not too painful?”</P>
<P>Emily briefly related the accident of
their meeting in the presence of her father,
and then so earnestly entreated the Count
not to hesitate in declaring what he knew,
that he perceived the violent emotion,
against which she was contending, and,
regarding her with a look of tender com∣passion,
considered how he might commu∣nicate
his information with least pain to his
anxious auditor.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="450"/>
“The Chevalier and my son” said he,
“were introduced to each other, at the
table of a brother officer, at whose house I
also met him, and invited him to my own,
whenever he should be disengaged. I did not
then know, that he had formed an acquaint∣ance
with a set of men, a disgrace to their
species, who live by plunder and pass their
lives in continual debauchery. I knew several
of the Chevalier's family, resident at Paris,
and considered them as sufficient pledges
for his introduction to my own. But you
are ill; I will leave the subject.”—“No,
sir,“said Emily, “I beg you will proceed:
I am only distressed.”—“ Only!” said the
Count, with emphasis; “however, I will
proceed. I soon learned, that these, his
associates, had drawn him into a course of
dissipation, from which he appeared to
have neither the power, nor the inclina∣tion,
to extricate himself. He lost large
sums at the gaming table; he became in∣satuated
with play; and was ruined. I
spoke tenderly of this to his friends, who
<PB N="449" REF="451"/>
assured me, that they had remonstrated
with him, till they were weary. I after∣wards
learned, that, in consideration of his
talents for play, which were generally suc∣cessful,
when unopposed by the tricks of
villany,—that in consideracion of these, the
party had initiated him into the secrets of
their trade, and allotted him a share of their
profits.“” Impossible!” said Emily sud∣denly;
“but—pardon me, sir, I scarcely
know what I say; allow for the distress of
my mind. I must, indeed, I must be∣lieve,
that you have not been truly in∣formed.
The Chevalier had, doubtless,
enemies, who misrepresented him.”—“ I
should be most happy to believe so,” replied
the Count, “but I cannot. Nothing short
of conviction, and a regard for your hap∣piness,
could have urged me to repeat these
unpleasant reports.”</P>
<P>Emily was silent. She recollected Va∣lancourt's
sayings, on the preceding even∣ing,
which discovered the pangs of self∣reproach,
and seemed to confirm all that
<PB N="450" REF="452"/>
the Count bad related. Yet she had not
fortitude enough to dare conviction. Her
heart was overwhelmed with anguish at the
mere suspicion of his guilt, and she could
not endure a belief of it. After a long
silence, the Count said, “I perceive, and
can allow for, your want of conviction.
It is necessary I should give some proof of
what I have asserted; but this I cannot
do, without subjecting one, who is very
dear to me, to danger.”—“ What is the
danger you apprehend, sir?” said Emily;
“if I can prevent it, you may safely. con∣side
in my honour.”—“ On your honour
I am certain I can rely,” said the Count;
“but can 1 trust your fortitude? Do you
think you can resist the solicitation of a
favoured admirer, when he pleads, in affliction,
for the name of one who has
robbed him of a biessing?”—“shall not
be exposed to such a temptation sir,“said
Emily, with modest pride,” for I cannot
favour one, whom I must no longer 'esteem.
I, hovrever, readily give my word.” Tears,
<PB N="451" REF="453"/>
in the mean time, contradicted her first
assertion; and she felt, that time and effort
only could eradicate an affection, which
had been formed on virtuous esteem, and
cherished by habit and difficulty.</P>
<P>“I will trust you then,” said the Count,
“for conviction is necessary to your peace,
and cannot, I perceive, be obtained, with∣out
this confidence. My son has too often
been an eye-witness of the Chevalier's ill∣conduct;
he was very near being drawn
in by it; he was, indeed, drawn in to the
commission of many follies, but I rescued
him from guilt and destruction. Judge
then, Mademoiselle St. Aubert, whether a
father, who had nearly lost his only son by
the example of the Chevalier, has not,
from conviction, reason to warn those,
whom he esteems, against trusting their
happiness in such hands. I have myself
seen the Chevalier engaged in deep play
with men, whom I almost shuddered to
look upon. If you still doubt, I will refer
you to my son.”</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="454"/>
“I must not doubt what you have your∣self
witnessed,” replied Emily, sinking
with grief, “or what you assert. But the
Chevalier has, perhaps, been drawn only
into a transient folly, which he may never
repeat. If you had known the justness of
his former principles, you would allow for
my present incredulity.”</P>
<P>“Alas!” observed the Count, “it is
difficult to believe that, which will make us
wretched. But I will not sooth you by
flattering and false hopes. We all Know
how fascinating the vice of gaming is, and
how difficult it is is, also, to conquer habit;
the Chevalier might, perhaps, reform for
a while, but he would soon relapse into
dissipation—for I fear, not only the bonds
of habit would be powerful, but that his
morals are corrupted. And—why should
I conceal from you, that play is not his
only vice? he appears to have a taste for
every vicious pleasure.”</P>
<P>The Count hesitated and paused; while
Emily endeavoured to support herself, as,
<PB N="453" REF="455"/>
with increasing perturbation, she expected
what he might further say. A long pause
of silence ensued, during which he was
visibly agitated; at length, he said, It
Would be a cruel delicacy, that could pre∣vail
with me to be silent—and I will in∣form
you, that the Chevalier's extrava∣gance
has brought him twice into the pri∣sons
of Paris, from whence he was last
extricated, as I was told upon authority,
which I cannot doubt, by a well-known
Parisian Countess, with whom he continued
to reside, when I left Paris.”</P>
<P>He paused again; and, looking at
Emily, perceived her countenance change,
and that she was falling from she seat;
he caught her, but she had fainted,
and he called loudly for assistance. They
were, however, beyond the hearing of his
servants at the chateau, and he feared to
leave her while he went thither for assist∣ance,
yet knew not how otherwise to ob∣tain
it; till a fountain at no great distance
caught his eye, and he endeavoured to
<PB N="454" REF="456"/>
support Emily against the tree, under which
she had been sitting, while he went thi∣ther
for water. But, again he was per∣plexed,
for he had nothing near him, in
which water could be brought; but while,
with increased anxiety, he watched her,
he thought he perceived in her counte∣nance
symptons of returning life.</P>
<P>It was long, however, before shereviv∣ed,
and she then found herself supported—
not by the Count, but by Valancourt, who
was observing her with looks of earnest ap∣prehension,
and who now spoke to her in
a tone, tremulous with his anxiety. At the
sound of his well-known voice, the raised
her eyes, but presently closed them, and a
faintness again came over her.</P>
<P>The Count, with a look somewhat stern,
waved him to withdraw; but he only sighed
heavily, and called on the name of Emily,
as he again held the water, that had been
brought, to her lips. On the Count's re∣peating
his action, and accompanying it
with words, Valancourt answered him with
<PB N="455" REF="457"/>
a look of deep resentment, and refused to
leave the place, till she should revive, or
to resign her for a moment to the care of
any person. In the next instant, his con∣science
Teemed to inform him of what had been the subject of the Count's con∣versation
with Emily, and indignation
flaslied in his eyes; but it was quickly re∣pressed,
and succeeded by an expression of
scrious anguish, that induced the Count to
regard him with more pity than resentment,
and the view of which so much affected
Emily, when she again revived, that she
yielded to the weakness of tears. But she
soon restrained them, and, exerting her resolution
to appear recovered, she rose, thanked the Count and Henri, with whom
Valancourt had entered the garden, for their
care, and moved towards the chateau, without noticing Valancourt, who, heart∣struck
by her manner, exclaimed in a low
voice—“Good God! how have I deserved
this?—what has been said, to occasion this
change?”</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="458"/>
Emily, without replying, but with in∣creased
emotion, quickened her steps.
“What has thus disordered you, Emily?
said he, as he still walked by her side:
give me a few moments' conversation,
I entreat you;—I am very miserable!”</P>
<P>Though this was spoken in a low voice,
it was overheard by the Count, who im∣mediately
replied, that Mademoiselle St.
Aubert was then too much indisposed, to
attend to any conversation, but that he
would venture to promise she would see
Monsieur Valancourt on the morrow, if she was better.</P>
<P>Valancourt's cheek was crimsoned: he
looked haughtily at the Count, and then
at Emily, with successive expressions of
surprise, grief and supplication, which she
could neither misunderstand, or resist, and
she said languidly—I shall be better
tomorrow, and if you wish to accept the
Count's permission, I will see you then.”</P>
<P>“See me!” exclaimed Valancourt, as
he threw a glance of mingled pride and
<PB N="457" REF="459"/>
resentment upon the Count; and then,
seeming to recollect himself, he added—
“But I will come, madam; I will accept
the Count's permission.”</P>
<P>When they reached the door of the cha∣teau,
he lingered a moment, for his re∣sentment
was now fled; and then, with a
look so expressive of tenderness and grief,
that Emily's heart was not proof against
it, he bade her good morning, and, bow∣ing
slightly to the Count, disappeared.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew to her own apartment,
under such oppression of heart as she had
seldom known, when she endeavoured to
recollect all that the Count had told, to
examine the probability of the circum∣stances
he himself believed, and to consi∣der
of her future conduct towards Valan∣court.
But, when she attempted to think,
her mind refused controul, and she could
only feel that she was miserable. One mo∣ment,
she sunk under the conviction, that
Valancourt was no longer the same, whom
had so tenderly loved, the idea of
<PB N="458" REF="460"/>
whom had hitherto supported her under
affliction, and cheered her with the hope
of happier days,—but a fallen a worth∣less
character, whom she must teach her∣self
to despise—if she could not forget. Then, unable to endure this terrible sup∣position,
she rejected it, and disdained to
believe him capable of conduct, such as
the Count had described, to whom she
believed he had been misrepreseneed by
some artful enemy; and there were mo∣ments,
when she even ventured to doubt
the integrity of the Count himself, and to
suspect, that he was influenced by some
selfish motive, to break her connection with
Valancourt. But this was the error of an
instant, only; the Count's character, which
she had heard spoken of by Du Pont and
many other persons, and had herself ob∣served,
enabled her to judge, and forbade
the supposition; had her confidence, in∣deed,
been less, there appeared to be no
temptation to betray him into conduct so
treacherous, and so cruel. Nor did reflec∣tion
<PB N="459" REF="461"/>
suffer her to preserve the hope, that
Va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancourt had been misrepresented to the
Count, who had said, that he spoke chief∣ly
from his own observation, and from his
son's experience. She must part from Va∣lancourt,
therefore, for ever—for what of
either happiness or tranquillity could she
expert with a man, whose tastes were! de∣generated
into low inclinations, and to
whom vice was become habitual? whom
she must no longer esteem, though the re∣membrance
of what he once was, and the
long habit of loving him, would render
it very difficult for her to despise him.</P>
<P>“O Valancourt!” she would exclaim,
“having been separated so long—do we
meet, only to be miserable—only to part
for ever?”</P>
<P>Amidst all the tumult of her mind, she
remembered pertinaciously the seeming
candour and simplicity of his conduct, on
the preceding night; and, had she dared
to trust her own-heart, it would have led
her to hope much from this. Still she
<PB N="460" REF="462"/>
could not resolve to dismiss him for ever,
without obtaining further proof of his ill
conduct; yet she saw no probability of pro∣curing
it, if, indeed, proof more positive
was possible. Something, however, it was
necessary to decide upon, and the almost
determined to be guided in her opinion
solely by the manner, with which Valan∣court
should receive her hints concerning
his late conduct.</P>
<P>Thus passed the hours till dinner-time,
when Emily, Struggling against the pres∣sure
of her grief, dried her tears, and
joined the family at table, where the Count
preserved towards her the most delicate at∣tention;
but the Countess and Mademoi∣selle
Bearn, having looked, for a moment,
with surprise, on her dejected countenance,
began, as usual, to talk of trisles, while
the eyes of Lady Blanche asked much of
her friend, who could only reply by a
mournful smile.</P>
<P>Emily withdrew as soon after dinner as
possible, and was followed by the Lady
<PB N="461" REF="463"/>
Blanche, whose anxious enquiries, how∣ever,
she found herself quite unequal to
answer, and whom she entreated to spare
her on the subject of her distress. To
converse on any topic, was now, indeed,
so extremely painful to her, that she soon
gave up the attempt, and Blanche lest
her, with pity of the sorrow, which she
perceived she had no power to assuage.</P>
<P>Emily secretly determined to go to her
convent in a day or two; for company, es∣pecially
that of the Countess and Made∣moiselle
Bearn, was intolerable to her, in
the present state of her spirits; and, in
the retirement of the convent, as well as the
kindness of the abbess, she hoped to reco∣ver
the command of her mind, and to
teach it resignation to the event, which, she
too plainly perceived, was approaching.</P>
<P>To have lost Valancourt by death, or to
have seen him married to a rival, would,
she thought, have given her less anguish,
than a conviction of his unworthiness,
which must terminate in misery to himself,
<PB N="462" REF="464"/>
and which robbed her even of the solitary
image her heart so long had cherished.
These painful reflections were interrupted,
for a moment, by a note from Valancourt,
written in evident distraction of mind, en∣treating,
that she would permit him to see
her on the approaching evening, instead of
the following morning; a request, which
occasioned her so much agitation, that she
was unable to answer it. She wished to
see him, and to terminate her present state
of suspense, yet shrunk from the interview,
and, incapable of deciding for herself, she,
at length, sent to beg a few moments'
conversation with the Count in his library, where she delivered to him the note, and
requested his advice. After reading it, he,
said, that, if she believed herself well
enough to support the interview, his opi∣nion
was, that, for the relief of both
parties, it ought to take place, that even∣ing.</P>
<P>“His affection for you is, undoubtedly,
A very sincere one,” added the Count;
<PB N="463" REF="465"/>
“and he appears so much distressed, and
you, my amiable friend, are so ill at case
—that the sooner the affair is decided, the
better.”</P>
<P>Emily replied, therefore, to Valancourt,
that she would see him, and then exerted
herself in endeavours to attain fortitude
and composure, to bear her through the
approaching scene—a scene so afflictingly
the reverse of any, to which she had look∣ed
forward!</P>
