<P>SO, my dear, we went on too fast, it
seems: Sir George was so obliging as
to settle all without waiting for Emily's
consent; not having supposed her refusal
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
to be in the chapter of possibilities: after
having communicated their plan of ope∣rations
to me as an affair settled, papa was
dispatched, as Sir George's ambassador,
to inform Emily of his gracious intentions
in her favor.</P>
<P>She received him with proper dignity,
and like a girl of true spirit told him,
that as the delay was originally from Sir
George, she should insist on observing the
conditions very exactly, and was deter∣mined
to wait till spring, whatever might
be the contents of Mrs. Clayton's ex∣pected
letter; reserving to herself also the
privilege of refusing him even then, if
upon mature deliberation she should think
proper so to do.</P>
<P>She has further insisted, that till that
time he shall leave Silleri; take up his
abode at Quebec, unless, which she thinks
most adviseable, he should return to Mon∣treal
for the winter; and never attempt
seeing her without witnesses, as their pre∣sent
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
situation is particularly delicate, and
that whilst it continues they can have
nothing to say to each other which their
common friends may not with propriety
hear: all she can be prevailed on to con∣sent
to in his favor, is to allow him <HI>cn at∣tendant</HI>
to visit here like any other gentle∣man.</P>
<P>I wish she would send him back to Mon∣treal,
for I see plainly he will spoil all our
little parties.</P>
<P>Emily is a fine girl, Lucy, and I am
friends with her again; so, my dear, I shall
revive my coterie, and be happy two or
three months longer. I have sent to ask my
two sweet fellows at Quebec to dine here:
I really long to see them; I shall let them
into the present state of affairs here, for
they both despise Sir George as much as I
do; the creature looks amazingly foolish,
and I enjoy his humiliation not a little:
such an animal to set up for being beloved
indeed! O to be sure!</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Emily has sent for me to her apartment.
Adieu for a moment.</P>
<P>Eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>She has shewn me Mrs. Melmoth's let∣ter
on the subject of concluding the mar∣riage
immediately: it is in the true spirit
of family impertinence. She writes with
the kind discreet insolence of a relation;
and Emily has answered her with the ge∣nuine
spirit of an independent English-woman,
who is so happy as to be her own
mistress, and who is therefore determined
to think for herself.</P>
<P>She has refused going to Montreal at all
this winter; and has hinted, though not
impolitely, that she wants no guardian of
her conduct but herself; adding a compli∣ment
to my ladyship's discretion so very
civil, it is impossible for me to repeat it
with decency.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>

I fly. The dear creatures! my life
has been absolute vegetation since they
absented themselves.</P>

<P>WE have the same parties and amuse∣ments
we used to have, my dear,
but there is by no means the same spirit in
them; constraint and dullness seem to have
taken the place of that sweet vivacity and
confidence which made our little society so
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
pleasing: this odious man has infected
us all; he seems rather a spy on our plea∣sures
than a partaker of them; he is more
an antidote to joy than a tall maiden
aunt.</P>
<P>I wish he would go; I say spontaneously
every time I see him, without considering I
am impolite, “La! Sir George, when do
“you go to Montreal?” He reddens, and
gives me a peevish answer; and I then, and
not before, recollect how very impertinent
the question is.</P>
<P>But pray, my dear, because he has no
taste for social companionable life, has he
therefore a right to damp the spirit of it in
those that have? I intend to consult some
learned casuist on this head.</P>
<P>He takes amazing pains to please in his
way, is curled, powdered, perfumed, and
exhibits every day in a new suit of em∣broidery;
but with all this, has the mortifi∣cation

<HEAD>LETTER LVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To JOHN TEMPLE, Es{que} Pall Mall.
<DATE>Jan. 25.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>SO you intend, my dear Jack, to marry
when you are quite tired of a life of
gallantry: the lady will be much obliged
to you for a heart, the refuse of half the
prostitutes in town; a heart, the best feel∣ings
of which will be entirely obliterated;
a heart hardened by a long commerce
with the most unworthy of the sex; and
which will bring disgust, suspicion, cold∣ness,
and depravity of taste, to the bosom
of sensibility and innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
For my own part, though fond of wo∣men
to the greatest degree, I have had,
considering my profession and complex∣ion,
very few intrigues. I have always
had an idea I should some time or other
marry, and have been unwilling to bring
to a state in which I hoped for happiness
from mutual affection, a heart worn out
by a course of gallantries: to a contrary
conduct is owing most of our unhappy
marriages; the woman brings with her
all her stock of tenderness, truth, and
affection; the man's is exhausted before
they meet: she finds the generous deli∣cate
tenderness of her soul, not only
unreturned, but unobserved; she fancies
some other woman the object of his
affection, she is unhappy, she pines in
secret; he observes her discontent, accuses
her of caprice; and her portion is wretch∣edness
for life.</P>
<P>If I did not ardently wish your happi∣ness,
I should not thus repeatedly combat
a prejudice, which, as you have sensibility,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
will infallibly make the greater part of
your life a scene of insipidity and regret.</P>
<P>You are right, Jack, as to the savages;
the only way to civilize them is to <HI>feminize</HI>
their women; but the task is rather diffi∣cult:
at present their manners differ in no∣thing
from those of the men; they even
add to the ferocity of the latter.</P>
<P>You desire to know the state of my
heart: excuse me, Jack; you know nothing
of love; and we who do, never disclose it's
mysteries to the prophane: besides, I al∣ways
choose a female for the confidante of
my sentiments; I hate even to speak of
love to one of my own sex.</P>
<P>Adieu! I am going a party with half a
dozen ladies, and have not another minute
to spare.</P>

<SIGNED>ED. RIVERS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATE>Jan. 28.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I EVERY hour, my dear, grow more in
love with French manners; there is
something charming in being young and
sprightly all one's life: it would appear
absurd in England to hear, what I have
just heard, a fat virtuous lady of seventy
toast <HI>Love and Opportunity</HI> to a young fel∣low:
but 'tis nothing here: they dance
too to the last gasp; I have seen the
daughter, mother, and grand-daughter,
in the same French country dance.</P>
<P>They are perfectly right; and I honor
them for their good sense and spirit, in de∣termining
to make life agreeable as long
as they can.</P>
<P><HI>A propos</HI> to age, I am resolved to go
home, Lucy; I have found three grey
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
hairs this morning; they tell me 'tis com∣mon;
this vile climate is at war with beau∣ty,
makes one's hair grey, and one's hands∣red.
I won't stay absolutely.</P>
<P>Do you know there is a very pretty
fellow here, Lucy, Captain Howard, who
has taken a fancy to make people believe
he and I are on good terms? He affects
to sit by me, to dance with me, to whis∣per
nothing to me, to bow with an air of
mystery, and to shew me all the little at∣tentions
of a lover in public, though he
never yet said a civil thing to me when
we were alone.</P>
<P>I was standing with him this morning
near the brow of the hill, leaning against a
tree in the sunshine, and looking down the
precipice below, when I said something
of the lover's leap, and in play, as you will
suppose, made a step forwards: we had
been talking of indifferent things, his air
was till then indolence itself; but on this
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
little motion of mine, though there was
not the least danger, he with the utmost
seeming eagerness catched hold of me as if
alarmed at the very idea, and with the
most passionate air protested his life de∣pended
on mine, and that he would not
live an hour after me. I looked at him
with astonishment, not being able to com∣prehend
the meaning of this sudden flight,
when turning my head, I saw a gentleman
and lady close behind us, whom he had
observed though I had not. They were
retiring: “Pray approach, my dear Ma∣dam,”
said I; “we have no secrets,
this declaration was intended for you
to hear; we were talking of the weather
before you came.”</P>
<P>He affected to smile, though I saw he
was mortified; but as his smile shewed
the finest teeth imaginable I forgave him:
he is really very handsome, and 'tis pity
he has this foolish quality of preferring
the shadow to the substance.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
I shall, however, desire him to flirt else∣where,
as this <HI>badinage,</HI> however innocent,
may hurt my character, and give pain to
my little Fitzgerald: I believe I begin to
love this fellow, because I begin to be
delicate on the subject of flirtations, and
feel my spirit of coquetry decline every
day.</P>
<P><DATE>29th.</DATE></P>
<P>Mrs. Clayton has wrote, my dear; and,
has at last condescended to allow Emily
the honor of being her daughter-in-law,
in consideration of her son's happiness,
and of engagements entered into with her
own consent; though she very prudently
observes, that what was a proper match
for Captain Clayton is by no means so for
Sir George; and talks something of an
offer of a citizen's daughter with fifty
thousand pounds, and the promise of an
Irish title. She has, however, observed
that indiscreet engagements are better
broke than kept.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
Sir George has shewn the letter, a very
indelicate one in my opinion, to my
father and me; and has talked a great
deal of nonsense on the subject. He wants
to shew it to Emily, and I advise him to
it, because I know the effect it will have.
I see plainly he wishes to make a great
merit of keeping his engagement, if he
does keep it: he hinted a little fear of
breaking her heart; and I am convinced
if he thought she could survive his infi∣delity,
all his tenderness and constancy
would cede to filial duty and a coronet.</P>
<P>Eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>After much deliberation, Sir George
has determined to write to Emily, inclose
his mother's letter, and call in the after∣noon
to enjoy the triumph of his genero∣sity
in keeping his engagement, when it
is in his power to do so much better: 'tis
a pretty plan, and I encourage him in it;
my father, who wishes the match, shrugs
his shoulders, and frowns at me; but the
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
little man is fixed as fate in his resolve, and
is writing at this moment in my father's
apartment. I long to see his letter; I
dare say it will be a curiosity: 'tis short,
however, for he is coming out of the room
already.</P>
<P>Adieu! my father calls for this letter;
it is to go in one of his to New York, and
the person who takes it waits for it at the
door.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Send you the inclosed from my mother:
I thought it necessary you should see it,

which I have had the happiness of
entering into with the most charming of
women, and which a man of honor ought
to hold sacred.</P>
<P>I do not think happiness intirely depen∣dent
on rank or fortune, and have only to
wish my mother's sentiments on this sub∣ject
more agreeable to my own, as there
is nothing I so much wish as to oblige her:
at all events, however, depend on my ful∣filling
those promises, which ought to be

the more binding, as they were made at a
time when our situations were more equal.</P>
<P>I am happy in an opportunity of con∣vincing
you and the world, that interest

heart, when put in competition with what
I owe to my engagements; being with the

<OPENER>To Sir GEORGE CLAYTON, at Quebec.
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have read Mrs. Clayton's letter with
attention; and am of her opinion, that
indiscreet engagements are better broke
than kept.</P>
<P>I have the less reason to take ill your
breaking the kind of engagement between
us at the desire of your family, as I en∣tered
into it at first entirely in compliance
with mine. I have ever had the sincerest
esteem and friendship for you, but never
that romantic love which hurries us to
forget all but itself: I have therefore no
reason to expect in you the imprudent
disinterestedness that passion occasions.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
A fuller explanation is necessary on
this subject than it is possible to enter into
in a letter: if you will favor us with your
company this afternoon at Silleri, we may
explain our sentiments more clearly to each
other: be assured, I never will prevent
your complying in every instance with the
wishes of so kind and prudent a mother.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="61" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER LXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.</OPENER>
<P>I Have been with Emily, who has been
reading Mrs. Clayton's letter; I saw
joy sparkle in her eyes as she went on,
her little heart seemed to flutter with tran∣sport;
I see two things very clearly, one
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
of which is, that she never loved this little
insipid Baronet; the other I leave your
fagacity to find out. All the spirit of her
countenance is returned: she walks in air;
her cheeks have the blush of pleasure; I
never saw so astonishing a change. I never
felt more joy from the acquisition of a new
lover, than she seems to find in the prospect
of losing an old one.</P>
<P>She has written to Sir George, and in a
style that I know will hurt him; for though
I believe he wishes her to give him up, yet
his vanity would desire it should cost her
very dear; and appear the effort of dis∣interested
love, and romantic generosity,
not what it really is, the effect of the most
tranquil and perfect indifference.</P>
<P>By the way, a disinterested mistress is,
according to my ideas, a mistress who
<HI>fancies</HI> she loves: we may talk what we
please, at a distance, of sacrificing the
dear man to his interest, and promoting
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
his happiness by destroying our own; but
when it comes to the point, I am rather
inclined to believe all women are of my
way of thinking; and let me die if I
would give up a man I loved to the first
duchess in Christendom: 'tis all mighty
well in theory; but for the practical part,
let who will believe it for Bell.</P>
<P>Indeed when a woman finds her lover
inclined to change, 'tis good to make a
virtue of necessity, and give the thing a
sentimental turn, which gratifies his vani∣ty,
and does not wound one's own.</P>

<P>YES, my Lucy, your brother tenderly
regrets the absence of a sister en∣deared
to him much more by her amiable
qualities than by blood; who would be
the object of his esteem and admiration,
if she was not that of his fraternal tender∣ness;
who has all the blooming graces,
simplicity, and innocence of nineteen,
with the accomplishments and understand∣ing
of five and twenty; who joins the
strength of mind so often confined to our
sex, to the softness, delicacy, and vivacity
of her own; who, in short, is all that is
estimable and lovely; and who, except
one, is the most charming of her sex:
you will forgive the exception, Lucy:
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
perhaps no man but a brother would
make it.</P>
<P>My sweet Emily appears every day
more amiable; she is now in the full
tyranny of her charms, at the age when
the mind is improved, and the person
in its perfection. I every day see in her
more indifference to her lover, a cir∣cumstance
which gives me a pleasure
which perhaps it ought not: there is a
selfishness in it, for which I am afraid I
ought to blush.</P>
<P>You judge perfectly well, my dear, in
checking the natural vivacity of your
temper, however pleasing it is to all who
converse with you: coquetry is dangerous
to English women, because they have
sensibility; it is more suited to the French,
who are naturally something of the sala∣mander
kind.</P>
<P>I have this moment a note from Bell
Fermor, that she must see me this instant.

<P>WE have passed three or four droll
days, my dear. Emily persists in
resolving to break with Sir George; he
thinks it decent to combat her resolution,
lest he should lose the praise of generosity:
he is also piqued to see her give him up
with such perfect composure, though I am
convinced he will not be sorry upon the
whole to be given up; he has, from the
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
first receipt of the letter, plainly wished
her to resign him, but hoped for a few
faintings and tears, as a sacrifice to his va∣nity
on the occasion.</P>
<P>My father is setting every engine at
work to make things up again, sup∣posing
Emily to have determined from
pique, not from the real feelings of her
heart: he is frighted to death lest I
should counterwork him, and so jealous
of my advising her to continue a conduct
he so much disapproves, that he won't
leave us a moment together; he even
observes carefully that each goes into
her respective apartment when we retire to
bed.</P>
<P>This jealousy has started an idea which
I think will amuse us, and which I shall
take the first opportunity of communicat∣ing
to Emily; 'tis to write each other at
night our sentiments on whatever passes in
the day: if she approves the plan, I will
send you the letters, which will save me
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
a great deal of trouble in telling you all
our <HI>petites histoires.</HI></P>
<P>This scheme will have another advan∣tage;
we shall be a thousand times more
sincere and open to each other by letter
than face to face; I have long seen by her
eyes that the little fool has twenty things
to say to me, but has not courage; now
letters you know, my dear,</P>
<LG>

<P>I Have but a moment, my Lucy, to tell
you, my divine Emily has broke with
her lover, who this morning took an eter∣nal
leave of her, and set out for Montreal
in his way to New York, whence he pro∣poses
to embark for England.</P>
<P>My sensations on this occasion are not
to be described: I admire that amiable
delicacy which has influenced her to give
up every advantage of rank and fortune
which could tempt the heart of woman,
rather than unite herself to a man for
whom she felt the least degree of indiffe∣rence;
and this, without regarding the
censures of her family, or of the world,
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
by whom, what they will call her impru∣dence,
will never be forgiven: a woman
who is capable of acting so nobly, is worthy
of being beloved, of being adored, by
every man who has a soul to distinguish
her perfections.</P>
<P>If I was a vain man, I might perhaps
fancy her regard for me had some share in
determining her conduct, but I am con∣vinced
of the contrary; 'tis the native de∣licacy
of her soul alone, incapable of form∣ing
an union in which the heart has no
share, which, independent of any other
consideration, has been the cause of a re∣solution
so worthy of herself.</P>
<P>That she has the tenderest affection for
me, I cannot doubt one moment; her at∣tention
is too flattering to be unobserved;
but 'tis that kind of affection in which
the mind alone is concerned. I never
gave her the most distant hint that I loved
her: in her situation, it would have been
even an outrage to have done so. She
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
knows the narrowness of my circumstan∣ces,
and how near impossible it is for me
to marry; she therefore could not have
an idea—no, my dear girl, 'tis not to
love, but to true delicacy, that she has
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acrificed avarice and ambition; and she
is a thousand times the more estimable
from this circumstance.</P>

precipice, without courage to retire
from so dangerous a situation: overborne
by my family, I have been near marry∣ing
a man for whom I have not the least
tenderness, and whose conversation is
even now tedious to me.”</P>
<P>“My dear friend, we were not formed
for each other: our minds have not the
least resemblance. Have you not ob∣served,
that, when I have timidly ha∣zarded
my ideas on the delicacy neces∣sary
to keep love alive in marriage, and
the difficulty of preserving the heart of
the object beloved in so intimate an
union, he has indolently assented, with
a coldness not to be described, to sen∣timents
which it is plain from his man∣ner
he did not understand; whilst ano∣ther,
not interested in the conversation,
has, by his countenance, by the fire of
his eyes, by looks more eloquent than
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
all language, shewed his soul was of
intelligence with mine!”</P>
<P>“A strong sense of the force of engage∣ments
entered into with my consent,
though not the effect of my free, unbi∣assed
choice, and the fear of making
Sir George, by whom I supposed my∣self
beloved, unhappy, have thus long
prevented my resolving to break with
him for ever; and though I could not
bring myself to marry him, I found
myself at the same time incapable of
assuming sufficient resolution to tell him
so, 'till his mother's letter gave me so
happy an occasion.”</P>
<P>“There is no saying what transport I
feel in being freed from the insupport∣able
yoke of this engagement, which
has long sat heavy on my heart, and
suspended the natural chearfulness of
my temper.”</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35"/>
“Yes, my dear, your Emily has been
wretched, without daring to confess it
even to you: I was ashamed of owning
I had entered into such engagements
with a man whom I had never loved<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
though I had for a short time mistaken
esteem for a greater degree of affection
than my heart ever really knew. How
fatal, my dear Bell, is this mistake to
half our sex, and how happy am I to
have discovered mine in time!”</P>
<P>“I have scarce yet asked myself what I
intend; but I think it will be most pru∣dent
to return to England in the first
ship, and retire to a relation of my mo∣ther's
in the country, where I can live
with decency on my little fortune.”</P>
<P>“Whatever is my fate, no situation can
be equally unhappy with that of being
wife to a man for whom I have not
even the slightest friendship or esteem,
for whose conversation I have not the
least taste, and who, if I know him,
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
would for ever think me under an obli∣gation
to him for marrying me.”</P>
<P>“I have the pleasure to see I give no
pain to his heart, by a step which has
relieved mine from misery: his feelings
are those of wounded vanity, not of love.”</P>

<P>I have no patience with relations,
Lucy; this sweet girl has been two years
wretched under the bondage her uncle's
avarice (for he foresaw Sir George's ac∣quisition,
though she did not) prepared
for her. Parents should choose our com∣pany,
but never even pretend to direct
our choice; if they take care we converse
with men of honour only, 'tis impossible
we can choose amiss: a conformity of
taste and sentiment alone can make mar∣riage
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
happy, and of that none but the par∣ties
concerned can judge.</P>
<P>By the way, I think long engagements,
even between persons who love, extremely
unfavourable to happiness: it is certainly
right to be long enough acquainted to
know something of each other's temper;
but 'tis bad to let the first fire burn out
before we come together; and when we
have once resolved, I have no notion of
delaying a moment.</P>
<P>If I should ever consent to marry Fitz∣gerald,
and he should not fly for a licence
before I had finished the sentence, I would
dismiss him if there was not another lover
to be had in Canada.</P>

<P>WOULD one think it possible,
Lucy, that Sir George should
console himself for the loss of all that is
lovely in woman, by the sordid prospect
of acquiring, by an interested marriage, a
little more of that wealth of which he has
already much more than he can either en∣joy
or become? By what wretched mo∣tives
are half mankind influenced in the
most important action of their lives!</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39"/>
The vulgar of every rank expect happi∣ness
where it is not to be found, in the
ideal advantages of splendor and dissipa∣tion;
those who dare to think, those
minds who partake of the celestial fire,
seek it in the real, solid pleasures of nature
and soft affection.</P>
<P>I have seen my lovely Emily since I
wrote to you; I shall not see her again
of some days; I do not intend at present
to make my visits to Silleri so frequent as
I have done lately, lest the world, ever
studious to blame, should misconstrue
her conduct on this very delicate oc∣casion.
I am even afraid to shew my
usual attention to her when present, lest
she herself should think I presume on the
politeness she has ever shewn me, and see
her breaking with Sir George in a false
light: the greater I think her obliging par∣tiality
to me, the more guarded I ought to
be in my behaviour to her; her situation
has some resemblance to widowhood, and
she has equal decorums to observe.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40"/>
I cannot however help encouraging a
pleasing hope that I am not absolutely in∣different
to her: her lovely eyes have a
softness when they meet mine, to which
words cannot do justice: she talks less to
me than to others, but it is in a tone of
voice which penetrates my soul; and
when I speak, her attention is most flat∣tering,
though of a nature not to be seen
by common observers; without seeming
to distinguish me from the crowd who
strive to engage her esteem and friendship,
she has a manner of addressing me which
the heart alone can feel; she contrives to
prevent my appearing to give her any
preference to the rest of her sex, yet I
have seen her blush at my civility to an∣other.</P>
<P>She has at least a friendship for me,
which alone would make the happiness of
my life; and which I would prefer to the
love of the most charming woman imagi∣nation
could form, sensible as I am to the
sweetest of all passions: this friendship,
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
however, time and assiduity may ripen
into love; at least I should be most un∣happy
if I did not think so.</P>
<P>I love her with a tenderness of which
few of my sex are capable: you have of∣ten
told me, and you were right, that my
heart has all the sensibility of woman.</P>

<P>YOU need be in no pain, my dear
brother, on Mr. Temple's account;
my heart is in no danger from a man of his
present character: his person and manner
are certainly extremely pleasing; his un∣derstanding,
and I believe his principles,
are worthy of your friendship; an enco∣mium
which, let me observe, is from me
a very high one: he will be admired
every where, but to be beloved, he wants,
or at least appears to me to want, the most
endearing of all qualities, that genuine
tenderness of soul, that almost feminine
sensibility, which, with all your firmness
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
of mind and spirit, you possess beyond any
man I ever yet met with.</P>
<P>If your friend wishes to please me,
which I almost fancy he does, he must en∣deavour
to resemble you; 'tis rather hard
upon me, I think, that the only man I
perfectly approve, and whose disposition
is formed to make me happy, should be
my brother: I beg you will find out
somebody very like yourself for your
sister, for you have really made me
saucy.</P>
<P>I pity you heartily, and wish above all
things to hear of your Emily's marriage,
for your present situation must be ex∣tremely
unpleasant.</P>
<P>But, my dear brother, as you were so
very wise about Temple, allow me to ask
you whether it is quite consistent with
prudence to throw yourself in the way of
a woman so formed to inspire you with
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
tenderness, and whom it is so impossible
you can ever hope to possess: is not this
acting a little like a foolish girl, who
plays round the flame which she knows
will consume her?</P>
<P>My mother is well, but will never be
happy till you return to England; I often
find her in tears over your letters: I will
say no more on a subject which I know
will give you pain. I hope, however, to
hear you have given up all thoughts of
settling in America: it would be a better
plan to turn farmer in Rutlandshire; we
could double the estate by living upon it,
and I am sure I should make the prettiest
milk-maid in the county.</P>
<P>I am serious, and think we could live
very superbly all together in the country;
consider it well, my dear Ned, for I can∣not
bear to see my mother so unhappy as
your absence makes her. I hear her on
the stairs; I must hurry away my letter,

<P>NEVER any astonishment equalled
mine, my dear Emily, at hearing
you had broke an engagement of years,
so much to your advantage as to fortune,
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
and with a man of so very unexception∣able
a character as Sir George, without
any other apparent cause than a slight in∣delicacy
in a letter of his mother's, for
which candour and affection would have
found a thousand excuses. I will not al∣low
myself to suppose, what is however
publicly said here, that you have sacri∣ficed
prudence, decorum, and I had al∣most
said honor, to an imprudent incli∣nation
for a man, to whom there is the
strongest reason to believe you are indiffe∣rent,
and who is even said to have an at∣tachment

you.</P>
<P>I am too unhappy to say more on this

a very sincere answer to two ques∣tions;
whether love for Colonel Rivers
was the real motive for the indiscreet step
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
you have taken? and whether, if it was,
you have the excuse of knowing he loves
you? I should be glad to know what

<SALUTE>My dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM too sensible of the rights of friend∣ship,
to refuse answering your questions;
which I shall do in as few words as possible.
I have not the least reason to suppose
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
myself beloved by Colonel Rivers; nor,
if I know my heart, do I <HI>love him</HI> in
that sense of the word your question
supposes: I think him the best, the
most amiable of mankind; and my ex∣treme
affection for him, though I be∣lieve
that affection only a very lively
friendship, first awakened me to a sense
of the indelicacy and impropriety of mar∣rying
Sir George.</P>
<P>To enter into so sacred an engagement
as marriage with one man, with a stronger
affection for another, of how calm and
innocent a nature soever that affection may
be, is a degree of baseness of which my
heart is incapable.</P>
<P>When I first agreed to marry Sir
George, I had no superior esteem for any
other man; I thought highly of him, and
wanted courage to resist the pressing so∣licitations
of my uncle, to whom I had a
thousand obligations. I even almost per∣suaded
myself I loved him, nor did I find
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
my mistake till I saw Colonel Rivers, in
whose conversation I had so very lively a
pleasure as soon convinced me of my
mistake: I therefore resolved to break
with Sir George, and nothing but the fear
of giving him pain prevented my doing it
sooner: his behaviour on the receipt of his
mother's letter removed that fear, and set
me free in my own opinion, and I hope will
in yours, from engagements which were
equally in the way of my happiness, and
his ambition. If he is sincere, he will tell
you my refusal of him made him happy,
though he chooses to affect a chagrin which
he does not feel.</P>
<P>I have no view but that of returning to
England in the spring, and fixing with a
relation in the country.</P>
<P>If Colonel Rivers has an attachment, I
hope it is to one worthy of him; for my
own part, I never entertained the remotest
thought of him in any light but that of the
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
most sincere and tender of friends. I
am, Madam, with great esteem,</P>

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Feb. 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THERE are two parties at Quebec in
regard to Emily: the prudent mam∣mas
abuse her for losing a good match, and
suppose it to proceed from her partiality to
your brother, to the imprudence of which
they give no quarter; whilst the misses ad∣mire
her generosity and spirit, in sacrific∣ing
all for love; so impossible it is to please
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
every body. However, she has, in my
opinion, done the wisest thing in the
world; that is, she has pleased herself.</P>
<P>As to her inclination for your brother, I
am of their opinion, that she loves him
without being quite clear in the point
herself: she has not yet confessed the fact
even to me; but she has speaking eyes,
Lucy, and I think I can interpret their
language.</P>
<P>Whether he sees it or not I cannot tell;
I rather think he does, because he has been
less here, and more guarded in his manner
when here, than before this matrimonial
affair was put an end to; which is natural
enough on that supposition, because he
knows the impertinence of Quebec, and is
both prudent and delicate to a great degree.</P>
<P>He comes, however, and we are pretty
good company, only a little more reserved
on both sides; which is, in my opinion, a
little symptomatic.</P>

<P>EVERY hour, my Lucy, convinces me
more clearly there is no happiness for
me without this lovely woman; her turn of
mind is so correspondent to my own, that
we seem to have but one soul: the first mo∣ment
I saw her the idea struck me that we
had been friends in some pre-existent state,
and were only renewing our acquaintance
here; when she speaks, my heart vibrates
to the sound, and owns every thought she
expresses a native there.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53"/>
The same dear affections, the same ten∣der
sensibility, the most precious gift of
Heaven, inform our minds, and make us
peculiarly capable of exquisite happiness
or misery.</P>
<P>The passions, my Lucy, are common to
all; but the affections, the lively sweet af∣fections,
the only sources of true pleasure,
are the portion only of a chosen few.</P>
<P>Uncertain at present of the nature of her
sentiments, I am determined to develop
them clearly before I discover mine: if she
loves as I do, even a perpetual exile here
will be pleasing. The remotest wood in
Canada with her would be no longer a
desert wild; it would be the habitation of
the Graces.</P>
<P>But I forget your letter, my dear girl;
I am hurt beyond words at what you tell
me of my mother; and would instantly re∣turn
to England, did not my fondness for
this charming woman detain me here: you
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
are both too good in wishing to retire with
me to the country; will your tenderness
lead you a step farther, my Lucy? It
would be too much to hope to see you
here; and yet, if I marry Emily, it will
be impossible for me to think of returning
to England.</P>
<P>There is a man here whom I should pre∣fer
of all men I ever saw for you; but he
is already attached to your friend Bell Fer∣mor,
who is very inattentive to her own
happiness, if she refuses him: I am very
happy in finding you think of Temple as
I wish you should.</P>
<P>You are so very civil, Lucy, in regard
to me, I am afraid of becoming vain from
your praises.</P>
<P>Take care, my dear, you don't spoil me
by this excess of civility, for my only me∣rit
is that of not being a coxcomb.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55"/>
I have a heaviness of heart, which has
never left me since I read your letter: I
am shocked at the idea of giving pain to
the best parent that ever existed; yet have
less hope than ever of seeing England,
without giving up the tender friend, the
dear companion, the adored mistress; in
short the very woman I have all my life
been in search of: I am also hurt that I
cannot place this object of all my wishes
in a station equal to that she has rejected,
and I begin to think rejected for me.</P>
<P>I never before repined at seeing the gifts
of fortune lavished on the unworthy.</P>

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Feb. 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Lordship does me great honor
in supposing me capable of giving
any satisfactory account of a country in
which I have spent only a few months.</P>
<P>As a proof, however, of my zeal, and
the very strong desire I have to merit the
esteem you honor me with, I shall com∣municate
from time to time the little I
have observed, and may observe, as well
as what I hear from good authority, with
that lively pleasure with which I have ever
obeyed every command of your Lord∣ship's.</P>
<P>The French, in the first settling this co∣lony,
seem to have had an eye only to the
conquest of ours: their whole system of
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
policy seems to have been military, not
commercial; or only so far commercial as
was necessary to supply the wants, and by
so doing to gain the friendship, of the sa∣vages,
in order to make use of them against
us.</P>
<P>The lands are held on military tenure:
every peasant is a soldier, every seigneur
an officer, and both serve without pay
whenever called upon; this service is, ex∣cept
a very small quit-rent by way of ac∣knowledgement,
all they pay for their
lands: the seigneur holds of the crown,
the peasant of the seigneur, who is at once
his lord and commander.</P>
<P>The peasants are in general tall and ro∣bust,
notwithstanding their excessive indo∣lence;
they love war, and hate labor; are
brave, hardy, alert in the field, but lazy
and inactive at home; in which they resem∣ble
the savages, whose manners they seem
strongly to have imbibed. The govern∣ment
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
appears to have encouraged a mili∣tary
spirit all over the colony; though ig∣norant
and stupid to a great degree, these
peasants have a strong sense of honor; and
though they serve, as I have said, without
pay, are never so happy as when called to
the field.</P>
<P>They are excessively vain, and not only
look on the French as the only civilized
nation in the world, but on themselves as
the flower of the French nation: they had,
I am told, a great aversion to the regular
troops which came from France in the late
war, and a contempt equal to that aver∣sion;
they however had an affection and
esteem for the late Marquis De Montcalm,
which almost rose to idolatry; and I have
even at this distance of time seen many of
them in tears at the mention of his name:
an honest tribute to the memory of a com∣mander
equally brave and humane; for
whom his enemies wept even on the day
when their own hero fell.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59"/>
I am called upon for this letter, and have
only time to assure your Lordship of my
respect, and of the pleasure I always re∣ceive

<P>I HAVE indeed, my dear, a pleasure in
his conversation, to which words cannot
do justice: love itself is less tender and
lively than my friendship for Rivers; from
the first moment I saw him, I lost all taste
for other conversation; even yours, ami∣able
as you are, borrows its most prevail∣ing
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
charm from the pleasure of hearing
you talk of him.</P>
<P>When I call my tenderness for him
friendship, I do not mean either to paint
myself as an enemy to tenderer sentiments,
or him as one whom it is easy to see with∣out
feeling them: all I mean is, that, as
our situations make it impossible for us to
think of each other except as friends, I
have endeavored—I hope with success—
to see him in no other light: it is not in
his power to marry without fortune, and
mine is a trifle: had I worlds, they should
be his; but, I am neither so selfish as to
desire, nor so romantic as to expect, that
he should descend from the rank of life
he has been bred in, and live lost to the
world with me.</P>
<P>As to the impertinence of two or three
women, I hear of it with perfect indif∣ference:
my dear Rivers esteems me, he
approves my conduct, and all else is be∣low
my care: the applause of worlds
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
would give me less pleasure than one smile
of approbation from him.</P>
<P>I am astonished your father should know
me so little, as to suppose me capable of
being influenced even by you: when I de∣termined
to refuse Sir George, it was from
the feelings of my own heart alone; the
first moment I saw Colonel Rivers con∣vinced
me my heart had till then been a
stranger to true tenderness: from that
moment my life has been one continued
struggle between my reason, which shewed
me the folly as well as indecency of marry∣ing
one man when I so infinitely preferred
another, and a false point of honor and
mistaken compassion: from which painful
state, a concurrence of favorable accidents
has at length happily relieved me, and left
me free to act as becomes me.</P>
<P>Of this, my dear, be assured, that,
though I have not the least idea of ever
marrying Colonel Rivers, yet, whilst my
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
sentiments for him continue what they are,
I will never marry any other man.</P>
<P>I am hurt at what Mrs. Melmoth hinted
in her letter to you, of Rivers having ap∣peared
to attach himself to me from vani∣ty;
she endeavors in vain to destroy my
esteem for him: you well know, he never
did appear to attach himself to me; he is
incapable of having done it from such a
motive; but if he had, such delight have
I in whatever pleases him, that I should
with joy have sacrificed my own vanity to
gratify his.</P>

<P>YES, my dear Bell, you know me
better than I know myself; your
Emily loves.—But tell me, and with that
clear sincerity which is the cement of our
friendship; has not your own heart dis∣covered
to you the secret of mine? do
you not also love this most amiable of
mankind? Yes, you do, and I am lost:
it is not in woman to see him without
love; there are a thousand charms in his
conversation, in his look, nay in the very
sound of his voice, to which it is impos∣sible
for a soul like yours to be insen∣sible.</P>
<P>I have observed you a thousand times
listening to him with that air of softness
and complacency—Believe me, my dear,
I am not angry with you for loving him;
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
he is formed to charm the heart of wo∣man:
I have not the least right to com∣plain
of you; yó<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u knew nothing of my
passion for him; you even regarded me
almost as the wife of another. But tell
me, though my heart dies within me at
the question, is your tenderness mutual?
does he love you? I have observed a
coldness in his manner lately, which now
alarms me.—My heart is torn in pieces.
Must I receive this wound from the two
persons on earth most dear to me? In∣deed,
my dear, this is more than your
Emily can bear. Tell me only whether
you love: I will not ask more.—Is there
on earth a man who can please where he
appears?</P>

<P>YOU have discovered me, my sweet
Emily: I love—not quite so dyingly
as you do; but I love; will you forgive
me when I add that I am beloved? It is
unnecessary to add the name of him I love,
as you have so kindly appropriated the
whole sex to Colonel Rivers.</P>
<P>However, to shew you it is possible you
may be mistaken, 'tis the little Fitz I
love, who, in my eye, is ten times more
agreeable than even your nonpareil of a
Colonel; I know you will think me a
shocking wretch for this depravity of
taste; but so it is.</P>
<P>Upon my word, I am half inclined to
be angry with you for not being in love
with Fitzgerald; a tall Irishman, with
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
good eyes, has as clear a title to make
conquests as other people.</P>
<P>Yes, my dear, <HI>there is a man on earth,</HI>
and even in the little town of Quebec,
<HI>who can please where he appears.</HI> Surely,
child, if there was but one man on earth
who could please, you would not be
so unreasonable as to engross him all to
yourself.</P>
<P>For my part, though I like Fitzgerald
extremely, I by no means insist that
every other woman shall.</P>
<P>Go, you are a foolish girl, and don't
know what you would be at. Rivers is a
very handsome agreeable fellow; but <HI>it is

<P>THOSE who have heard no more
of a Canadian winter than what
regards the intenseness of its cold, must
suppose it a very joyless season: 'tis,
I assure you, quite otherwise; there are
indeed some days here of the severity of
which those who were never out of Eng∣land
can form no conception; but those
days seldom exceed a dozen in a whole
winter; nor do they come in succession, but
at intermediate periods, as the winds set
in from the North-West; which, coming
some hundred leagues, from frozen lakes
and rivers, over woods and mountains co∣vered
with snow, would be insupportable,
were it not for the furs with which the
country abounds, in such variety and
plenty as to be within the reach of all its
inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="71"/>
Thus defended, the British belles set
the winter of Canada at defiance; and
the season of which you seem to entertain
such terrible ideas, is that of the utmost
chearfulness and festivity.</P>
<P>But what particularly pleases me is,
there is no place where women are of such
importance: not one of the sex, who has
the least share of attractions, is without a
levee of beaux interceding for the honor
of attending her on some party, of
which every day produces three or
four.</P>
<P>I am just returned from one of the
most agreeable jaunts imagination can
paint, to the island of Orleans, by the
falls of Montmorenci; the latter is al∣most
nine miles distant, across the great
bason of Quebec; but as we are obliged
to reach it in winter by the waving line,
our direct road being intercepted by the
inequalities of the ice, it is now perhaps
a third more. You will possibly suppose
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
a ride of this kind must want one of the
greatest essentials to entertainment, that of
variety, and imagine it only one dull whirl
over an unvaried plain of snow: on the
contrary, my dear, we pass hills and
mountains of ice in the trifling space of
these few miles. The bason of Quebec
is formed by the conflux of the rivers St.
Charles and Montmorenci with the great
river St. Lawrence, the rapidity of whose
flood-tide, as these rivers are gradually
seized by the frost, breaks up the ice, and
drives it back in heaps, till it forms ridges
of transparent rock to an height that is
astonishing, and of a strength which bids
defiance to the utmost rage of the most
furiously rushing tide.</P>
<P>This circumstance makes this little jour∣ney
more pleasing than you can possibly con∣ceive:
the serene blue sky above, the daz∣ling
brightness of the sun, and the colors
from the refraction of its rays on the transpa∣rent
part of these ridges of ice, the wind∣ing
course these oblige you to make, the
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
sudden disappearing of a train of fifteen or
twenty carrioles, as these ridges intervene,
which again discover themselves on your
rising to the top of the frozen mount, the
tremendous appearance both of the ascent
and descent, which however are not attend∣ed
with the least danger; all together give
a grandeur and variety to the scene, which
almost rise to enchantment.</P>
<P>Your dull foggy climate affords nothing
that can give you the least idea of our
frost pieces in Canada; nor can you form
any notion of our amusements, of the
agreeableness of a covered carriole, with
a sprightly fellow, rendered more spright∣ly
by the keen air and romantic scene
about him; to say nothing of the fair lady
at his side.</P>
<P>Even an overturning has nothing a∣larming
in it; you are laid gently down
on a soft bed of snow, without the least
danger of any kind; and an accident of
this sort only gives a pretty fellow occa∣sion
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
to vary the style of his civilities,
and shew a greater degree of attention.</P>
<P>But it is almost time to come to Mont∣morenci:
to avoid, however, fatiguing you
or myself, I shall refer the rest of our tour
to another letter, which will probably ac∣company
this: my meaning is, that two
moderate letters are vastly better than
one long one; in which sentiment I know
you agree with</P>

<OPENER>To Miss RIVERS, Clarges Street.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>Feb. 25,</DATE> Afternoon.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SO, my dear, as I was saying, this same
ride to Montmorenci—where was I,
Lucy? I forget.—O, I believe pretty near
the mouth of the bay, embosomed in
which lies the lovely cascade of which I
am to give you a winter description, and
which I only slightly mentioned when I
gave you an account of the rivers by
which it is supplied.</P>
<P>The road, about a mile before you
reach this bay, is a regular glassy level,
without any of those intervening hills of
ice which I have mentioned; hills, which
with the ideas, though false ones, of dan∣ger
and difficulty, give those of beauty
and magnificence too.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76"/>
As you gradually approach the bay,
you are struck with an awe, which in∣creases
every moment, as you come near∣er,
from the grandeur of a scene, which
is one of the noblest works of nature: the
beauty, the proportion, the solemnity, the
wild magnificence of which, surpassing
every possible effect of art, impress one
strongly with the idea of its Divine Al∣mighty
Architect.</P>
<P>The rock on the east side, which is first
in view as you approach, is a smooth and
almost perpendicular precipice, of the
same height as the fall; the top, which a
little over-hangs, is beautifully covered
with pines, firs, and ever-greens of vari∣ous
kinds, whose verdant lustre is render∣ed
at this season more shining and lovely
by the surrounding snow, as well as by that
which is sprinkled irregularly on their
branches, and glitters half melted in the
sun-beams: a thousand smaller shrubs are
scattered on the side of the ascent, and,
having their roots in almost impercepti∣ble
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
clefts of the rock, seem to those be∣low
to grow in air.</P>
<P>The west side is equally lofty, but more
sloping, which, from that circumstance,
affords soil all the way, upon shelving in∣equalities
of the rock, at little distances,
for the growth of trees and shrubs, by
which it is almost entirely hid.</P>
<P>The most pleasing view of this miracle
of nature is certainly in summer, and in
the early part of it, when every tree is in
foliage and full verdure, every shrub in
flower; and when the river, swelled with a
waste of waters from the mountains from
which it derives its source, pours down in
a tumultuous torrent, that equally charms
and astonishes the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>holder.</P>
<P>The winter scene has, notwithstanding,
its beauties, though of a different kind,
more resembling the stillness and inactivity
of the season.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78"/>
The river being on its sides bound up in
frost, and its channel rendered narrower
than in the summer, affords a less body of
water to supply the cascade; and the fall,
though very steep, yet not being exactly
perpendicular, masses of ice are formed,
on different shelving projections of the
rock, in a great variety of forms and pro∣portions.</P>
<P>The torrent, which before rushed with
such impetuosity down the deep descent in
one vast sheet of water, now descends in
some parts with a slow and majestic pace;
in others seems almost suspended in mid
air; and in others, bursting through the
obstacles which interrupt its course, pours
down with redoubled fury into the foam∣ing
bason below, from whence a spray
arises, which, freezing in its ascent, be∣comes
on each side a wide and irregular
frozen breast-work; and in front, the
spray being there much greater, a lofty
and magnificent pyramid of solid ice.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="79"/>
I have not told you half the grandeur,
half the beauty, half the lovely wildness
of this scene: if you would know what it
is, you must take no information but that
of your own eyes, which I pronounce
strangers to the loveliest work of creation
till they have seen the river and fall of
Montmorenci.</P>
<P>In short, my dear, I am Montmorenci∣mad.</P>
<P>I can hardly descend to tell you, we
passed the ice from thence to Orleans, and
dined out of doors on six feet of snow, in
the charming enlivening warmth of the
sun, though in the month of February,
at a time when you in England scarce feel
his beams.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald made violent love to me all
the way, and I never felt myself listen
with such complacency.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80"/>
Adieu! I have wrote two immense let∣ters.
Write oftener; you are lazy, yet

<P>Do you know your brother has admir∣able

when he led her into the dining room at

<DATE>March 1.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS mistaken, my dear; not a word
of love between your brother and
Emily, as she positively assures me; some∣thing
very tender has passed, I am con∣vinced,
notwithstanding, for she blushes
more than ever when he approaches, and
there is a certain softness in his voice when
he addresses her, which cannot escape a
person of my penetration.</P>
<P>Do you know, my dear Lucy, that there
is a little impertinent girl here, a Made∣moiselle
Clairaut, who, on the mere merit
of features and complexion, sets up for be∣ing
as handsome as Emily and me?</P>
<P>If beauty, as I will take the liberty to
assert, is given us for the purpose of pleas∣ing,
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
she who pleases most, that is to say,
she who excites the most passion, is to all
intents and purposes the most beautiful
woman; and, in this case, I am inclined to
believe your little Bell stands pretty high
on the roll of beauty; the men's <HI>eyes</HI> may
perhaps <HI>say</HI> she is handsome, but their
<HI>hearts feel</HI> that I am so.</P>
<P>There is, in general, nothing so insipid,
so uninteresting, as a Beauty; which those
men experience to their cost, who choose
from vanity, not inclination. I remem∣ber
Sir Charles Herbert, a Captain in the
same regiment with my father, who deter∣mined
to marry Miss Raymond before he
saw her, merely because he had been told
she was a celebrated beauty, though she
was never known to have inspired a real
passion: he saw her not with his own eyes
but those of the public, took her charms
on trust; and, till he was her husband,
never found out she was not his taste; a
secret, however, of some little importance
to his happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/>
I have, however, known some Beauties
who had a right to please; that is, who had
a mixture of that invisible charm, that
nameless grace which by no means depends
on beauty, and which strikes the heart in
a moment; but my first aversion is your
<HI>fine women:</HI> don't you think <HI>a fine woman</HI>
a detestable creature, Lucy? I do: they
are vastly well to <HI>fill</HI> public places: but as
to the heart—Heavens, my dear! yet there
are men, I suppose, to be found, who
have a taste for the great sublime in
beauty.</P>
<P>Men are vastly foolish, my dear; very
few of them have spirit to think for them∣selves;
there are a thousand Sir Charles
Herberts: I have seen some of them weak
enough to decline marrying the woman
on earth most pleasing to themselves, be∣cause
not thought handsome by the gene∣rality
of their companions.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84"/>
Women are above this folly, and there∣fore
choose much oftener from affection
than men. We are a thousand times
wiser, Lucy, than these important beings,
these mighty lords,</P>
<LG>
<L>“Who strut and fret their hour upon
the stage;”</L>
</LG>
<P>and, instead of playing the part in life
which nature dictates to their reason and
their hearts, act a borrowed one at the will
of others.</P>

judge for myself.</P>

<P>AFTER debating with myself some
days, I am determined to pursue
Emily; but before I make a declaration,
will go to see some ungranted lands at the
back of Madame Des Roches's estate;
which, lying on a very fine river, and so
near the St. Lawrence, may I think be
cultivated at less expence than those above
Lake Champlain, though in a much infe∣rior
climate: if I make my settlement
here, I will purchase the estate Madame
Des Roches has to sell, which will open
me a road to the river St. Lawrence, and
consequently treble the value of my
lands.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86"/>
I love, I adore this charming woman;
but I will not suffer my tenderness for
her to make her unhappy, or to lower her
station in life: if I can by my present
plan, secure her what will in this country
be a degree of affluence, I will endeavor
to change her friendship for me into a
tenderer and more lively affection; if she
loves, I know by my own heart, that
Canada will be no longer a place of
exile; if I have flattered myself, and she
has only a friendship for me, I will return
immediately to England, and retire with
you and my mother to our little estate
in the country.</P>
<P>You will perhaps say, why not make
Emily of our party? I am almost ashamed
to speak plain; but so weak are we, and so
guided by the prejudices we fancy we
despise, that I cannot bear my Emily, after
refusing a coach and six, should live without
an equipage suitable at least to her birth,
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
and the manner in which she has always
lived when in England.</P>
<P>I know this is folly, that it is a despi∣cable
pride; but it is a folly, a pride, I
cannot conquer.</P>
<P>There are moments when I am above
all this childish prejudice, but it returns
upon me in spite of myself.</P>
<P>Will you come to us, my Lucy? Tell
my mother, I will build her a rustic pa∣lace,
and settle a little principality on you
both.</P>
<P>I make this a private excursion, because
I don't choose any body should even guess
at my views. I shall set out in the even∣ing,
and make a circuit to cross the river
above the town.</P>
<P>I shall not even take leave at Silleri, as
I propose being back in four days, and I

<P>YOUR brother is gone nobody knows
whither, and without calling upon
us before he set off; we are piqued,
I assure you, my dear, and with some
little reason.</P>
<P>Four o'clock.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89"/>
Very strange news, Lucy; they say
Colonel Rivers is gone to marry Madame
Des Roches, a lady at whose house he was
some time in autumn; if this is true, I
forswear the whole sex: his manner of
stealing off is certainly very odd, and she
is rich and agreeable; but, if he does not
love Emily, he has been excessively cruel
in shewing an attention which has de∣ceived
her into a passion for him. I can∣not
believe it possible: not that he has
ever told her he loved her; but a man of
honour will not tell an untruth even with
his eyes, and his have spoke a very une∣quivocal
language.</P>
<P>I never saw any thing like her confu∣sion,
when she was told he was gone to
visit Madame Des Roches; but, when it
was hinted with what design, I was obli∣ged
to take her out of the room, or she
would have discovered all the fondness of
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
her soul. I really thought she would
have fainted as I led her out.</P>
<P>Eight o'clock.</P>
<P>I have sent away all the men, and drank
tea in Emily's apartment; she has scarce
spoke to me; I am miserable for her; she
has a paleness which alarms me, the tears
steal every moment into her lovely eyes.
Can Rivers act so unworthy a part? her
tenderness cannot have been unobserved
by him; it was too visible to every body.</P>
<P>9th, Ten o'clock.</P>
<P>Not a line from your brother yet;
only a confirmation of his being with
Madame Des Roches, having been seen
there by some Canadians who are come
up this morning: I am not quite pleased,
though I do not believe the report; he
might have told us surely where he was
going.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="91"/>
I pity Emily beyond words; she says
nothing, but there is a dumb eloquence
in her countenance which is not to be de∣scribed.</P>
<P>Twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>I have been an hour alone with the dear
little girl, who has, from a hint I dropt
on purpose, taken courage to speak to me
on this very interesting subject; she says,
“she shall be most unhappy if this re∣port
is true, though without the least
right to complain of Colonel Rivers,
who never even hinted a word of any
affection for her more tender than
friendship; that if her vanity, her self∣love,
or her tenderness, have deceived
her, she ought only to blame herself.”
She added, “that she wished him to
marry Madame Des Roches, if she
could make him happy;” but when she
said this, an involuntary tear seemed to
contradict the generosity of her senti∣ments.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92"/>
I beg your pardon, my dear, but my
esteem for your brother is greatly lessen∣ed;
I cannot help fearing there is some∣thing
in the report, and that this is what
Mrs. Melmoth meant when she men∣tioned
his having an attachment.</P>
<P>I shall begin to hate the whole sex,
Lucy, if I find your brother unworthy,
and shall give Fitzgerald his dismission
immediately.</P>
<P>I am afraid Mrs. Melmoth knows men
better than we foolish girls do: she said,
he attached himself to Emily merely from
vanity, and I begin to believe she was
right: how cruel is this conduct! The
man who from vanity, or perhaps only to
amuse an idle hour, can appear to be at∣tached
where he is not, and by that
means seduce the heart of a deserving wo∣man,
or indeed of any woman, falls in
my opinion very little short in baseness of
him who practises a greater degree of se∣duction.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="93"/>
What right has he to make the most
amiable of women wretched? a woman
who would have deserved him had he
been monarch of the universal world! I
might add, who has sacrificed ease and
affluence to her tenderness for him?</P>
<P>You will excuse my warmth on such an
occasion; however, as it may give you
pain, I will say no more.</P>

<P>I Have met with something, my dear
Lucy, which has given me infinite
uneasiness; Madame Des Roches, from
my extreme zeal to serve her in an affair
wherein she has been hardly used, from
my second visit, and a certain involun∣tary
attention, and softness of manner, I
have to all women, has supposed me in
love with her, and with a frankness I can∣not
but admire, and a delicacy not to be
described, has let me know I am far from
being indifferent to her.</P>
<P>I was at first extremely embarrassed;
but when I had reflected a moment, I con∣sidered
that the ladies, tho' another may
be the object, always regard with a kind
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
of complacency a man who <HI>loves,</HI> as one
who acknowledges the power of the sex,
whereas an indifferent is a kind of rebel
to their empire; I considered also that the
confession of a prior inclination saves the
most delicate vanity from being wounded;
and therefore determined to make her the
confidante of my tenderness for Emily;
leaving her an opening to suppose that, if
my heart had been disengaged, it could
not have escaped her attractions.</P>
<P>I did this with all possible precaution,
and with every softening that friendship and
politeness could suggest; she was shocked
at my confession, but soon recovered her∣self
enough to tell me she was highly flat∣tered
by this proof of my confidence and
esteem; that she believed me a man to
have only the more respect for a woman
who by owning her partiality had told
me she considered me not only as the
most amiable, but the most noble
of my sex; that she had heard, no
love was so tender as that which was the
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
child of friendship; but that of this she
was convinced, that no friendship was so
tender as that which was the child of
love; that she offered me this tender, this
lively friendship, and would for the fu∣ture
find her happiness in the considera∣tion
of mine.</P>
<P>Do you know, my dear, that since this
confession, I feel a kind of tenderness for
her, to which I cannot give a name? It is
not love; for I love, I idolize another:
but it is softer and more pleasing, as well
as more animated, than friendship.</P>
<P>You cannot conceive what pleasure I
find in her conversation; she has an ad∣mirable
understanding, a feeling heart,
and a mixture of softness and spirit in her
manner, which is peculiarly pleasing to
men. My Emily will love her; I must
bring them acquainted: she promises to
come to Quebec in May; I shall be happy
to shew her every attention when there.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="97"/>
I have seen the lands, and am pleased
with them: I believe this will be my re∣sidence,
if Emily, as I cannot avoid
hoping, will make me happy; I shall de∣clare
myself as soon as I return, but must
continue here a few days longer: I shall
not be less pleased with this situation for
its being so near Madame Des Roches, in
whom Emily will find a friend worthy of
her esteem, and an entertaining lively
companion.</P>

<P>STILL with Madame Des Roches;
appearances are rather against him,
you must own, Lucy: but I will not say
all I think to you. Poor Emily! we
dispute continually, for she will persist in
defending his conduct; she says, he has
a right to marry whoever he pleases; that
her loving him is no tie upon his honor,
especially as he does not even know of this
preference; that she ought only to blame
the weakness of her own heart, which has
betrayed her into a false belief that their
tenderness was mutual: this is pretty talk∣ing,
but he has done every thing to con∣vince
her of his feeling the strongest pas∣sion
for her, except making a formal de∣claration.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99"/>
She talks of returning to England the
moment the river is open: indeed, if your
brother marries, it is the only step left her
to take. I almost wish now she had married
Sir George: she would have had all the
<HI>douceurs</HI> of marriage; and as to love, I be∣gin

some of them can indeed talk well on the

<OPENER>To the Earl of ——.
<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>March 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I GENERALLY distrust my own opi∣nion
when it differs from your Lord∣ship's;
but in this instance I am most cer∣tainly
in the right: allow me to say, no∣thing
can be more ill-judged than your
Lordship's design of retiring into a small
circle, from that world of which you have
so long been one of the most brilliant or∣naments.
What you say of the disagree∣ableness
of age, is by no means applicable
to your Lordship; nothing is in this re∣spect
so fallible as the parish register.
Why should any man retire from society
whilst he is capable of contributing to the
pleasures of it? Wit, vivacity, good-na∣ture,
and politeness, give an eternal youth,
as stupidity and moroseness a premature
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
old age. Without a thousandth part of
your Lordship's shining qualities, I think
myself much younger than half the boys
about me, merely because I have more
good-nature, and a stronger desire of
pleasing.</P>
<P>My daughter is much honored by your
Lordship's enquiries: she is Bell Fermor
still; but is addressed by a gentleman who
is extremely agreeable to me, and I believe
not less so to her; I however know too well
the free spirit of woman, of which she has
her full share, to let Bell know I ap∣prove
her choice; I am even in doubt
whether it would not be good policy to
seem to dislike the match, in order to se∣cure
her consent; there is something very
pleasing to a young girl, in opposing the
will of her father.</P>
<P>To speak truth, I am a little out of hu∣mor
with her at present, for having con∣tributed,
and I believe entirely from a spi∣rit
of opposition to me, to break a match
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
on which I had extremely set my heart;
the lady was the niece of my particular
friend, and one of the most lovely and de∣serving
women I ever knew: the gentle∣man
very worthy, with an agreeable, in∣deed
a very handsome person, and a for∣tune
which with those who know the
world, would have compensated for the
want of most other advantages.</P>
<P>The fair lady, after an engagement of
two years, took a whim that there was no
happiness in marriage without being mad∣ly
in love, and that her passion was not
sufficiently romantic; in which piece of
folly my rebel encouraged her, and the
affair broke off in a manner which has
brought on her the imputation of having
given way to an idle prepossession in fa∣vor
of another.</P>
<P>Your Lordship will excuse my talking
on a subject very near my heart, though
uninteresting to you; I have too often ex∣perienced
your Lordship's indulgence to
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
doubt it on this occasion: your good-na∣tured
philosophy will tell you, much fewer
people talk or write to amuse or inform
their friends, than to give way to the feel∣ings
of their own hearts, or indulge the
governing passion of the moment.</P>
<P>In my next, I will endeavor in the best
manner I can, to obey your Lordship's
commands in regard to the political and
religious state of Canada: I will make a
point of getting the best information pos∣sible;
what I have yet seen, has been only
the surface.</P>

<P>YOUR brother is come back; and has
been here: he came after dinner yes∣terday.
My Emily is more than woman;
I am proud of her behaviour: he entered
with his usual impatient air; she received
him with a dignity which astonished me,
and disconcerted him: there was a cool dis∣passionate
indifference in her whole man∣ner,
which I saw cut his vanity to the
quick, and for which he was by no means
prepared.</P>
<P>On such an occasion I should have flirt∣ed
violently with some other man, and
have shewed plainly I was piqued: she
judged much better; I have only to wish
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
it may last. He is the veriest coquet in
nature; for, after all, I am convinced he
loves Emily.</P>
<P>He stayed a very little time, and has
not been here this morning; he may pout
if he pleases, but I flatter myself we shall
hold out the longest.</P>
<P>Nine o'clock.</P>
<P>He came to dine; we kept up our state
all dinner time; he begged a moment's
conversation, which we refused, but with
a timid air that makes me begin to fear
we shall beat a parley: he is this moment
gone, and Emily retired to her apartment
on pretence of indisposition: I am afraid
she is a foolish girl.</P>
<P>Half hour after six.</P>
<P>It will not do, Lucy: I found her in
tears at the window, following Rivers's
carriole with her eyes: she turned to me
with such a look—in short, my dear,</P>
<Q><PB N="104" REF="106"/>
“The weak, the fond, the fool, the
coward woman”</Q>
<P>has prevailed over all her resolution: her
love is only the more violent for having
been a moment restrained; she is not
equal to the task she has undertaken; her
resentment was concealed tenderness, and
has retaken its first form.</P>
<P>I am sorry to find there is not one wise
woman in the world but myself.</P>
<P>Past ten.</P>
<P>I have been with her again: she seemed
a little calmer; I commended her spirit;
she disavowed it; was peevish with me,
angry with herself; said she had acted in
a manner unworthy her character; accus∣ed
herself of caprice, artifice, and cru∣elty;
said she ought to have seen him, if
not alone, yet with me only: that it was
natural he should be surprized at a recep∣tion
so inconsistent with true friendship,
and therefore that he should wish an ex∣planation;
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
that <HI>her</HI> Rivers (and why not
Madame Des Roches's Rivers?) was in∣capable
of acting otherwise than as became
the best and most tender of mankind, and
that therefore she ought not to have suf∣fered
a whisper injurious to his honor:
that I had meant well, but had, by de∣priving
her of Rivers's friendship, which
she had lost by her haughty behaviour,
destroyed all the happiness of her life.</P>
<P>To be sure, your poor Bell is always
to blame: but if ever I intermeddle be∣tween
lovers again, Lucy—</P>
<P>I am sure she was ten times more angry
with him than I was, but this it is to be
too warm in the interest of our friends.</P>

<P>I CANNOT account, my dear, for what
has happened to me. I left Madame
Des Roches's full of the warm impatience

I was received with a disdainful coldness
which I did not think had been in her na∣ture,
and which has shocked me beyond
all expression.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="109"/>
I went again to-day, and met with the

was painful to her, therefore shortened my
visit, and, if I have resolution to persevere,
will not go again till invited by Captain
Fermor in form.</P>
<P>I could bear any thing but to lose her
affection; my whole heart was set upon
her: I had every reason to believe myself
dear to her. Can caprice find a place in
that bosom which is the abode of every
virtue?</P>
<P>I must have been misrepresented to her,
or surely this could not have happened:
I will wait to-morrow, and if I hear no∣thing

<P>IF you are not absolutely resolved on de∣struction,
my dear Emily, it is yet in
your power to retrieve the false step you
have made.</P>
<P>Sir George, whose good-nature is in this
instance almost without example, has been
prevailed on by Mr. Melmoth to consent
I should write to you before he leaves
Montreal, and again offer you his hand,
though rejected in a manner so very mor∣tifying
both to vanity and love.</P>
<P>He gives you a fortnight to consider his
offer, at the end of which if you refuse him
he sets out for England over the lakes.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113"/>
Be assured, the man for whom it is too
plain you have acted this imprudent part,
is so far from returning your affection▪
that he is at this moment addressing ano∣ther;
I mean Madame Des Roches, a near

<P>I AM sorry, my dear Madam, you
should know so little of my heart, as
to suppose it possible I could have broke
my engagements with Sir George from
any motive but the full conviction of my
wanting that tender affection for him, and
that lively taste for his conversation, which
alone could have insured either his feli∣city
or my own; happy is it for both that
I discovered this before it was too late:
it was a very unpleasing circumstance,
even under an intention only of marrying
him, to find my friendship stronger for
another; what then would it have been
under the most sacred of all engagements,
that of marriage? What wretchedness
would have been the portion of both, had
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
timidity, decorum, or false honor, carried
me, with this partiality in my heart, to
fulfill those views, entered into from com∣pliance
to my family, and continued from
a false idea of propriety, and weak fear of
the censures of the world?</P>
<P>The same reason therefore still subsist∣ing,
nay being every moment stronger,
from a fuller conviction of the merit of
him my heart prefers, in spite of me, to
Sir George, our union is more impossible
than ever.</P>
<P>I am however obliged to you, and Ma∣jor
Melmoth, for your zeal to serve me,
though you must permit me to call it a
mistaken one; and to Sir George, for a
concession, which I own I should not have
made in his situation, and which I can
only suppose the effect of Major Mel∣moth's
persuasions, which he might sup∣pose
were known to me, and an imagina∣tion
that my sentiments for him were
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
changed: assure him of my esteem, tho'
love is not in my power.</P>
<P>As Colonel Rivers never gave me the
remotest reason to suppose him more than
my friend, I have not the least right to
disapprove his marrying: on the contrary,
as his friend, I <HI>ought</HI> to wish a connexion
which I am told is greatly to his advan∣tage.</P>
<P>To prevent all future importunity,
painful to me, and, all circumstances con∣sidered,
degrading to Sir George, whose
honor is very dear to me, though I am
obliged to refuse him that hand which he
surely cannot wish to receive without my
heart, I am compelled to say, that, with∣out
an idea of ever being united to
Colonel Rivers, I will never marry any
other man.</P>
<P>Were I never again to behold him, were
he even the husband of another, my ten∣derness,
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
a tenderness as innocent as it is
lively, would never cease: nor would I
give up the refined delight of loving him,
independently of any hope of being be∣loved,
for any advantage in the power of
fortune to bestow.</P>
<P>These being my sentiments, sentiments
which no time can alter, they cannot be
too soon known to Sir George: I would
not one hour keep him in suspence in a
point, which this step seems to say is of
consequence to his happiness.</P>
<P>Tell him, I entreat him to forget me,
and to come into views which will make
his mother, and I have no doubt himself,
happier than a marriage with a woman
whose chief merit is that very sincerity of
heart which obliges her to refuse him.</P>

<P>Heavens! the fellow is here, has fol∣lowed

<P>The dear man is gone, and has made

with; which you know was impossible,
without betraying the secret of poor

<P>I however contrived to let him know
we were a little piqued at his going with∣out
seeing us, and that we were some∣thing

<P>He made a pretty decent defence; and,

<P>THE coldness of which I complained,
my dear Lucy, in regard to Emily,
was the most flattering circumstance which
could have happened: I will not say it
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
was the effect of jealousy, but it certainly
was of a delicacy of affection which ex∣tremely
resembles it.</P>
<P>Never did she appear so lovely as yester∣day;
never did she display such variety of
loveliness: there was a something in her
look, when I first addressed her on enter∣ing
the room, touching beyond all words,
a certain inexpressible melting languor, a
dying softness, which it was not in man
to see unmoved: what then must a lover
have felt?</P>
<P>I had the pleasure, after having been in
the room a few moments, to see this
charming languor change to a joy which
animated her whole form, and of which I
was so happy as to believe myself the
cause: my eyes had told her all that
passed in my heart; hers had shewed me
plainly they understood their language.
We were standing at a window at some
little distance from the rest of the com∣pany,
when I took an opportunity of hint∣ing
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
my concern at having, though with∣out
knowing it, offended her: she blush∣ed,
she looked down; she again raised her
lovely eyes, they met mine, she sighed;
I took her hand, she withdrew it, but
not in anger; a smile, like that of the
poet's Hebe, told me I was forgiven.</P>
<P>There is no describing what then passed
in my soul: with what difficulty did I re∣strain
my transports! never before did I
really know love: what I had hitherto
felt even for her, was cold to that en∣chanting,
that impassioned moment.</P>
<P>She is a thousand times dearer to me than
life: my Lucy, I cannot live without her.</P>
<P>I contrived, before I left Silleri, to
speak to Bell Fermor on the subject of
Emily's reception of me; she did not
fully explain herself, but she convinced
me hatred had no part in her resentment.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="125"/>
I am going again this afternoon: every
hour not passed with her is lost.</P>
<P>I will seek a favorable occasion of tell∣ing
her the whole happiness of my life de∣pends
on her tenderness.</P>
<P>Before I write again, my fate will pos∣sibly
be determined: with every reason to
hope, the timidity inseparable from love
makes me dread a full explanation of my
sentiments: if her native softness should
have deceived me—but I will not study
to be unhappy.</P>

meet him, and left my love to finish the
conversation alone.</P>
<P>Twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>I am the happiest of all possible wo∣men;
Fitzgerald is in the sullens about
your brother; surely there is no pleasure
in nature equal to that of plaguing a fel∣low
who really loves one, especially if he
has as much merit as Fitzgerald, for other∣wise
he would not be worth tormenting.
He had better not pout with me: I be∣lieve
I know who will be tired first.</P>
<P>Eight in the evening.</P>
<P>I have passed a most delicious day:
Fitzgerald took it into his wise head to
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
endeavor to make me jealous of a little
pert Frenchwoman, the wife of a Croix
de St. Louis, who I know he despises; I
then thought myself at full liberty to
play off all my airs, which I did with in∣effable
success, and have sent him home
in a humor to hang himself. Your bro∣ther
stays the evening, so does a very
handsome fellow I have been flirting with
all the day: Fitz was engaged here too,
but I told him it was impossible for him
not to attend Madame La Brosse to Que∣bec;
he looked at me with a spite in his
countenance which charmed me to the
soul, and handed the fair lady to his car∣riole.</P>
<P>I'll teach him to coquet, Lucy; let
him take his Madame La Brosse: indeed,
as her husband is at Montreal, I don't
see how he can avoid pursuing his con∣quest:
I am delighted, because I know
she is his aversion.</P>

<P>I HAVE but a moment, my dear Ned,
to tell you, that without so much as
asking your leave, and in spite of all your
wise admonitions, your lovely sister has
this morning consented to make me the
happiest of mankind: to-morrow gives
me all that is excellent and charming in
woman.</P>
<P>You are to look on my writing this let∣ter

must love you with no common affection
to remember at this moment that there is
such a man in being: perhaps you owe
this recollection only to your being bro∣ther

done more towards my conversion than

<P>I AM afraid you knew very little of the
sex, my dear brother, when you cau∣tioned
me so strongly against loving Mr.
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
Temple: I should perhaps, with all his
merit, have never thought of him but
for that caution.</P>
<P>There is something very interesting to
female curiosity in the idea of these very
formidable men, whom no woman can
see without danger; we gaze on the ter∣rible
creature at a distance, see nothing
in him so very alarming; he approaches,
our little hearts palpitate with fear, he
is gentle, attentive, respectful; we are
surprized at this respect, we are sure the
world wrongs the dear civil creature;
he flatters, we are pleased with his flat∣tery;
our little hearts still palpitate—but
not with fear.</P>
<P>In short, my dear brother, if you wish
to serve a friend with us, describe him as
the most dangerous of his sex; the very
idea that he is so, makes us think resist∣ance
vain, and we throw down our de∣sensive
arms in absolute despair.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132"/>
I am not sure this is the reason of my
discovering Mr. Temple to be the most
amiable of men; but of this I am certain,
that I love him with the most lively affec∣tion,
and that I am convinced, notwith∣standing
all you have said, that he de∣serves
all my tenderness.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear prudent brother,
you men fancy yourselves extremely
wise and penetrating, but you don't
know each other half so well as we
know you: I shall make Temple in
a few weeks as tame a domestic animal
as you can possibly be, even with your
Emily.</P>
<P>I hope you won't be very angry with
me for accepting an agreeable fellow, and
a coach and six: if you are, I can only
say, that finding the dear man steal every
day upon my heart, and recollecting how
very dangerous a creature he was,</P>

<P>Please to observe, mamma was on Mr.
Temple's side, and that I only take him
from obedience to her commands. He
has behaved like an angel to her; but I
leave himself to explain how: she has
promised to live with us. We are going
a party to Richmond, and only wait for
Mr. Temple.</P>
<P>With all my pertness, I tremble at the
idea that to-morrow will determine the
happiness or misery of my life.</P>

<P>WERE I convinced of your con∣version,
my dear Jack, I should
be the happiest man breathing in the
thought of your marrying my sister; but
I tremble lest this resolution should be
the effect of passion merely, and not of
that settled esteem and tender confidence
without which mutual repentance will
be the necessary consequence of your con∣nexion.</P>
<P>Lucy is one of the most beautiful wo∣men
I ever knew, but she has merits of a
much superior kind; her understanding
and her heart are equally lovely: she has
also a sensibility which exceedingly alarms
me for her, as I know it is next to impos∣sible

so long accustomed to change.</P>
<P>Do I not guess too truly, my dear Tem∣ple,
when I suppose the charming mistress
is the only object you have in view; and
that the tender amiable friend, the pleasing
companion, the faithful confidante, is
forgot?</P>
<P>I will not however anticipate evils: if
any merit has power to fix you, Lucy's
cannot fail of doing it.</P>
<P>I expect with impatience a further ac∣count

is so extremely interested.</P>
<P>If she is yours, may you know her va∣lue,

<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>March 23.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your second letter,
my dear Temple, with the account of
your marriage.</P>
<P>Nothing could make me so happy as an
event which unites a sister I idolize to the
friend on earth most dear to me, did I not
tremble for your future happiness, from
my perfect knowledge of both.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="137"/>
I know the sensibility of Lucy's temper,
and that she loves you: I know also the
difficulty of weaning the heart from such
a habit of inconstancy as you have unhap∣pily
acquired.</P>
<P>Virtues like Lucy's will for ever com∣mand
your esteem and friendship; but in
marriage it is equally necessary to keep
love alive: her beauty, her gaiety, her de∣licacy,
will do much; but it is also ne∣cessary,
my dearest Temple, that you
keep a guard on your heart, accustomed
to liberty, to give way to every light
impression.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, who have experi∣enced
the truth of what I say, that happi∣ness
is not to be found in a life of intrigue;
there is no real pleasure in the possession
of beauty without the heart; with it, the
fears, the anxieties, a man not absolutely
destitute of humanity must feel for the
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
honor of her who ventures more than life
for him, must extremely counterbalance
his transports.</P>
<P>Of all the situations this world affords,
a marriage of choice gives the fairest pros∣pect
of happiness; without love, life would
be a tasteless void; an unconnected hu∣man
being is the most wretched of all crea∣tures:
by love I would be understood to
mean that tender lively friendship, that
mixed sensation, which the libertine never
felt; and with which I flatter myself my
amiable sister cannot fail of inspiring a
heart naturally virtuous, however at pre∣sent
warped by a foolish compliance with
the world.</P>
<P>I hope, my dear Temple, to see you re∣cover
your taste for those pleasures pecu∣liarly
fitted to our natures; to see you en∣joy
the pure delights of peaceful domestic
life, the calm social evening hour, the
circle of friends, the prattling offspring,
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
and the tender impassioned smile of real
love.</P>
<P>Your generosity is no more than I ex∣pected
from your character; and to con∣vince
you of my perfect esteem, I so far
accept it, as to draw out the money I
have in the funds, which I intended for
my sister: it will make my settlement here
turn to greater advantage, and I allow
you the pleasure of convincing Lucy of
the perfect disinterestedness of your af∣fection:
it would be a trifle to you, and
will make me happy.</P>
<P>But I am more delicate in regard to my
mother, and will never consent to resume
the estate I have settled on her: I esteem
you above all mankind, but will not let
<HI>her</HI> be dependent even on you: I consent
she visit you as often as she pleases, but
insist on her continuing her house in
town, and living in every respect as she
has been accustomed.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="140"/>
As to Lucy's own little fortune, as it
is not worth your receiving, suppose she
lays it out in jewels? I love to see
beauty adorned; and two thousand
pounds, added to what you have given
her, will set her on a footing in this
respect with a nabobess.</P>
<P>Your marriage, my dear Temple, re∣moves
the strongest objection to mine;
the money I have in the funds, which
whilst Lucy was unmarried I never
would have taken, enables me to fix
to great advantage here. I have now
only to try whether Emily's friendship
for me is sufficiently strong to give up
all hopes of a return to England.</P>
<P>I shall make an immediate trial: you
shall know the event in a few days. If
she refuses me, I bid adieu to all my
schemes, and embark in the first ship.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141"/>
Give my kindest tenderest wishes to my
mother and sister. My dear Temple, only
know the value of the treasure you possess,
and you must be happy. Adieu!</P>

<OPENER>To the Earl of—.
<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>March 24.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING can be more just than
your Lordship's observation; and I
am the more pleased with it, as it coincides
with what I had the honor of saying to you
in my last, in regard to the impropriety,
the cruelty, I had almost said the injustice,
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
of your intention of deserting that world
of which you are at once the ornament
and the example.</P>
<P>Good people, as your Lordship ob∣serves,
are generally too retired and abstract∣ed
to let their example be of much service
to the world: whereas the bad, on the con∣trary,
are conspicuous to all; they stand
forth, they appear on the fore ground of
the picture, and force themselves into ob∣servation.</P>
<P>'Tis to that circumstance, I am per∣suaded,
we may attribute that dangerous
and too common mistake, that vice is na∣tural
to the human heart, and virtuous
characters the creatures of fancy; a mistake
of the most fatal tendency, as it tends to
harden our hearts, and destroy that mutual
confidence so necessary to keep the bands
of society from loosening, and without
which man is the most ferocious of all
beasts of prey.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="143"/>
Would all those whose virtues like
your Lordship's are adorned by po∣liteness
and knowledge of the world,
mix more in society, we should soon
see vice hide her head: would all the
good appear in full view, they would,
I am convinced, be found infinitely the
majority.</P>
<P>Virtue is too lovely to be hid in cells,
the world is her scene of action: she is
soft, gentle, indulgent; let her appear
then in her own form, and she must
charm: let politeness be for ever her
attendant, that politeness which can
give graces even to vice itself, which
makes superiority easy, removes the
sense of inferiority, and adds to every
one's enjoyment both of himself and
others.</P>
<P>I am interrupted, and must postpone

<P>YOUR brother, my dear Lucy, has
made me happy in communicating
to me the account he has received of your
marriage. I know Temple; he is, be∣sides
being very handsome, a fine, spright∣ly,
agreeable fellow, and is particularly
formed to keep a woman's mind in that
kind of play, that gentle agitation, which
will for ever secure her affection.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145"/>
He has in my opinion just as much co∣quetry
as is necessary to prevent marriage
from degenerating into that sleepy kind
of existence, which to minds of the
awakened turn of yours and mine would
be insupportable.</P>
<P>He has also a fine fortune, which I hold
to be a pretty enough ingredient in mar∣riage.</P>
<P>In short, he is just such a man, upon
the whole, as I should have chose for my∣self.</P>
<P>Make my congratulations to the dear
man, and tell him, if he is not the
happiest man in the world, he will
forfeit all his pretensions to taste; and
if he does not make you the happiest
woman, he forfeits all title to my fa∣vor,
as well as to the favor of the whole
sex.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146"/>
I meant to say something civil; but,
to tell you the truth, I am not <HI>en train;</HI>
I am excessively out of humor: Fitz∣gerald
has not been here of several days,
but spends his whole time in gallant∣ing
Madame La Brosse, a woman to
whom he knows I have an aversion, and
who has nothing but a tolerable com∣plexion
and a modest assurance to recom∣mend
her.</P>
<P>I certainly gave him some provoca∣tion,
but this is too much: however,
'tis very well; I don't think I shall
break my heart, though my vanity is a
little piqued. I may perhaps live to take
my revenge.</P>
<P>I am hurt, because I began really
to like the creature; a secret however to
which he is happily a stranger. I shall see
him to-morrow at the governor's, and sup∣pose
he will be in his penitentials: I have
some doubt whether I shall let him dance
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
with me; yet it would look so particular
to refuse him, that I believe I shall do him
the honor.</P>

<P>No, Lucy, if I forgive him this, I have
lost all the free spirit of woman; he had
the insolence to dance with Madame La
Brosse to-night at the governor's. I never
will forgive him. There are men perhaps
quite his equals!—but 'tis no matter—I
do him too much honor to be piqued—yet
on the footing we were—I could not have
believed—</P>
<P>Adieu!</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="148"/>
I was so certain he would have danced
with me, that I refused Colonel H—, one
of the most agreeable men in the place,
and therefore could not dance at all.
Nothing hurt me so much as the imperti∣nent
looks of the women; I could cry for
vexation.</P>
<P>Would your brother have behaved thus
to Emily? but why do I name other men
with your brother! do you know he and
Emily had the good-nature to refuse to
dance, that my sitting still might be the
less taken notice of? We all played at
cards, and Rivers contrived to be of my
party, by which he would have won
Emily's heart if he had not had it before.</P>

<P>I HAVE been twice at Silleri with the
intention of declaring my passion, and

have been prevented by company, which
made it impossible for me to find the op∣portunity
I wished.</P>
<P>Had I found that opportunity, I am not

of timidity is inseparable from true tender∣ness;
and I am afraid of declaring myself a
lover, lest, if not beloved, I should lose the
happiness I at present possess in visiting
her as her friend: I cannot give up the
dear delight I find in seeing her, in hear∣ing
her voice, in tracing and admiring
every sentiment of that lovely unaffected
generous mind as it rises.</P>

In short, my Lucy, I cannot live without
her esteem and friendship; and though her
eyes, her attention to me, her whole man∣ner,
encourage me in the hope of being
beloved, yet the possibility of my being
mistaken makes me dread an explanation

<P>SHE is an angel, my dear Lucy, and
no words can do her justice: I am

undissembled love; she heard me with
the most flattering attention; she said

<OPENER>To Mrs. TEMPLE, Pall Mall.
<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>28th March.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD this morning a short billet from
her dear hand, entreating me to make
up a quarrel between Bell Fermor and her
lover: your friend has been indiscreet;
her spirit of coquetry is eternally carrying
her wrong; but in my opinion Fitzgerald
has been at least equally to blame.</P>
<P>His behaviour at the governor's on
Thursday night was inexcusable, as it
exposed her to the sneers of a whole circle
of her own sex, many of them jealous of
her perfections.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="155"/>
A lover should overlook little caprices,
where the heart is good and amiable like
Bell's: I should think myself particu∣larly
obliged to bring this affair to an
amicable conclusion, even if Emily had
not desired it, as I was originally the in∣nocent
cause of their quarrel. In my
opinion he ought to beg her pardon;
and, as a friend tenderly interested for
both, I have a right to tell him I think
so: he loves her, and I know must suffer
greatly, though a foolish pride prevents
his acknowledging it.</P>
<P>My greatest fear is, that an idle resent∣ment
may engage him in an intrigue with
the lady in question, who is a woman of
gallantry, and whom he may find very
troublesome hereafter. It is much easier
to commence an affair of this kind than
to break it off; and a man, though his
heart was disengaged, should be always
on his guard against any thing like an
attachment where his affections are not
really interested: mere passion or mere
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
vanity will support an affair <HI>en passant;</HI>
but, where the least degree of constancy
and attention are expected, the heart must
feel, or the lover is subjecting himself to
a slavery as irksome as a marriage with∣out
inclination.</P>
<P>Temple will tell you I speak like an
oracle; for I have often seen him led by
vanity into this very disagreeable situa∣tion:
I hope I am not too late to save
Fitzgerald from it.</P>
<P>Six in the evening.</P>
<P>All goes well: his proud heart is come
down, he has begged her pardon, and is
forgiven; you have no idea how civil
both are to me, for having persuaded
them to do what each of them has longed
to do from the first moment: I love to
advise, when I am sure the heart of the
person advised is on my side. Both were
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
to blame, but I always love to save the
ladies from any thing mortifying to the
dignity of their characters; a little pride
in love becomes them, but not us; and
'tis always our part to submit on these oc∣casions.</P>
<P>I never saw two happier people than
they are at present, as I have a little
preserved decorum on both sides, and
taken the whole trouble of the recon∣ciliation
on myself▪ Bell knows nothing
of my having applied to Fitzgerald, nor
he that I did it at Emily's request: my
conversation with him on this subject
seemed accidental. I was obliged to
leave them, having business in town;
but my lovely Emily thanked me by a
smile which would overpay a thousand
such little services.</P>

indeed if such a woman as Madame
La Brosse could have rivalled me: I am
something younger; and, if either my
glass or the men are to be believed,
as handsome: <HI>entre nous,</HI> there is some
little difference; if she was not so
very fair, she would be absolutely ug∣ly:
and these very fair women, you
know, Lucy, are always insipid; she
is the taste of no man breathing, though
eternally making advances to every man;
without spirit, fire, understanding, vi∣vacity,
or any quality capable of mak∣ing
amends for the mediocrity of her
charms.</P>
<P>Her insolence in attempting to attach
Fitzgerald is intolerable, especially when
the whole province knows him to be my
lover: there is no expressing to what a
degree I hate her.</P>
<P>The next time we meet I hope to re∣turn
her impertinence on Thursday night
at the governor's: I will never forgive
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
Fitzgerald if he takes the least notice of
her.</P>
<P>Emily has read my letter; and says she
did not think I had so much of the wo∣man
in me; insists on my being civil to
Madame La Brosse, but if I am, Lucy—</P>
<P>These Frenchwomen are not to be sup∣ported;
they fancy vanity and assurance
are to make up for the want of every
other virtue; forgetting that delicacy,
softness, sensibility, tenderness, are at∣tractions
to which they are strangers:
some of them here are however tole∣rably
handsome, and have a degree of
liveliness which makes them not quite in∣supportable.</P>
<P>You will call all this spite, as Emily
does, so I will say no more: only that, in
order to shew her how very easy it is to
be civil to a rival, I wish for the pleasure
of seeing another French lady, that I
could mention, at Quebec.</P>

<P>COME to my dressing-room, my dear;
I have a thousand things to say to
you: I want to talk of my Rivers, to tell
you all the weakness of my soul.</P>
<P>No, my dear, I cannot love him more,
a passion like mine will not admit addition;
from the first moment I saw him my whole
soul was his: I knew not that I was dear
to him; but true genuine love is self-ex∣istent,
and does not depend on being be∣loved:
I should have loved him even had
he been attached to another.</P>
<P>This declaration has made me the hap∣piest
of my sex; but it has not increased,
it could not increase, my tenderness:
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
with what softness, what diffidence, what
respect, what delicacy, was this decla∣ration
made! my dear friend, he is a god,
and my ardent affection for him is fully
justified.</P>
<P>I love him—no words can speak how
much I love him.</P>
<P>My passion for him is the first and shall
be the last of my life: my bosom never
heaved a sigh but for my Rivers.</P>
<P>Will you pardon the folly of a heart
which till now was ashamed to own its
feelings, and of which you are even now
the only confidante?</P>
<P>I find all the world so insipid, nothing
amuses me one moment; in short, I have
no pleasure but in Rivers's conversation,
nor do I count the hours of his absence in
my existence.</P>

<P>YES, my dear, I love, at least I think
so; but, thanks to my stars, not in
the manner you do.</P>
<P>I prefer Fitzgerald to all the rest of his
sex; but <HI>I count the hours of his absence in
my existence;</HI> and contrive sometimes to
pass them pleasantly enough, if any other

agreeable man is in the way: in short, I
relish flattery and attention from others,
tho' I infinitely prefer them from him.</P>
<P>I certainly love him, for I was jealous
of Madame La Brosse; but, in general, I
am not alarmed when I see him flirt a little
with others. Perhaps my vanity was as
much wounded as my love, with regard
to Madame La Brosse.</P>

<P>NOT alarmed, my dear, at his atten∣tion

know nothing of love.</P>
<P>I think every woman who beholds my
Rivers a rival; I imagine I see in every
female countenance a passion tender and
lively as my own; I turn pale, my heart
dies within me, if I observe his eyes a mo∣ment
fixed on any other woman; I trem∣ble
at the possibility of his changing; I
cannot support the idea that the time may
come when I may be less dear to my Ri∣vers
than at present. Do you believe it
possible, my dearest Bell, for any heart,
not prepossessed, to be insensible one mo∣ment
to my Rivers?</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="167"/>
He is formed to charm the soul of wo∣man;
his delicacy, his sensibility, the
mind that speaks through those eloquent
eyes; the thousand graces of his air, the
sound of his voice—my dear, I never
heard him speak without feeling a soft∣ness
of which it is impossible to convey
an idea.</P>
<P>But I am wrong to encourage a tender∣ness
which is already too great; I will
think less of him; I will not talk of
him; do not speak of him to me, my
dear Bell: talk to me of Fitzgerald;
there is no danger of your passion becom∣ing
too violent.</P>
<P>I wish you loved more tenderly, my
dearest; you would then be more indul∣gent
to my weakness: I am ashamed of
owning it even to you.</P>
<P>Ashamed, did I say? no, I rather glory
in loving the most amiable, the most an∣gelic
of mankind.</P>

<P>I AM at present, my dear Lucy, ex∣tremely
embarrassed; Madame Des
Roches is at Quebec: it is impossible for
me not to be more than polite to her; yet
my Emily has all my heart, and demands
all my attention; there is but one way of
seeing them both as often as I wish; 'tis
to bring them as often as possible toge∣ther:
I wish extremely that Emily would
visit her, but 'tis a point of the utmost
delicacy to manage.</P>
<P>Will it not on reflection be cruel to
Madame Des Roches? I know her gene∣rosity
of mind, but I also know the
weakness of the human heart: can she
see with pleasure a beloved rival?</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="170"/>
My Lucy, I never so much wanted
your advice: I will consult Bell Fermor,
who knows every thought of my Emily's
heart.</P>
<P>Eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>I have visited Madame Des Roches at
her relation's; she received me with a
pleasure which was too visible not to be
observed by all present: she blushed, her
voice faltered when she addressed me;
her eyes had a softness which seemed to
reproach my insensibility: I was shocked
at the idea of having inspired her with a
tenderness not in my power to return; I
was afraid of increasing that tenderness;
I scarce dared to meet her looks.</P>
<P>I felt a criminal in the presence of this
amiable woman; for both our sakes, I
must see her seldom: yet what an ap∣pearance
will my neglect have, after the
attention she has shewed me, and the
friendship she has expressed for me to all
the world?</P>

I know not what to determine. I am
going to Silleri. Adieu till my return.</P>

Des Roches among the number of

<P>COULD you have believed he would
have expected such a proof of my
desire to oblige him? but what can he ask
that his Emily will refuse? I will see this
<HI>friend</HI> of his, this Madame Des Roches; I
will even love her, if it is in woman to be
so disinterested. She loves him; he sees
her; they say she is amiable; I could have
wished her visit to Quebec had been de∣layed.</P>
<P>But he comes; he looks up; his eyes

what is there I would not do

<P><PB N="171" REF="173"/>
Six o'clock.</P>
<P>Do you think her so very pleasing, my

not more fire than softness? There was a
vivacity in her manner which hurt me ex∣tremely:
could she have behaved with
such unconcern, had she loved as I do?</P>
<P>Do you think it possible, Lucy, for a
Frenchwoman to love? is not vanity the
ruling passion of their hearts?</P>
<P>May not Rivers be deceived in sup∣posing
her so much attached to him? was
there not some degree of affectation in her
particular attention to me? I cannot help
thinking her artful.</P>
<P>Perhaps I am prejudiced: she may be
amiable, but I will own she does not please
me.</P>

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>March 29.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE are going to dine at a farm-house
in the country, where we are to
meet other company, and have a ball: the
snow begins a little to soften, from the
warmth of the sun, which is greater than
in England in May. Our winter parties
are almost at an end.</P>
<P>My father drives Madame Des Roches,
who is of our party, and your brother
Emily; I hope the little fool will be easy
now, Lucy; she is very humble, to be
jealous of one, who, though really very
pleasing, is neither so young nor so hand∣some
as herself; and who professes to wish
only for Rivers's friendship.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180"/>
But I have no right to say a word
on this subject, after having been so ex∣tremely
hurt at Fitzgerald's attention to
such a woman as Madame La Brosse; an
attention too which was so plainly meant
to pique me.</P>
<P>We are all, I am afraid, a little ab∣surd
in these affairs, and therefore ought
to have some degree of indulgence for
others.</P>
<P>Emily and I, however, differ in our
ideas of love: it is the business of her life,
the amusement of mine; 'tis the food of
her hours, the seasoning of mine.</P>
<P>Or, in other words, she loves like a
foolish woman, I like a sensible man:
for men, you know, compared to wo∣men,
love in about the proportion of one
to twenty.</P>
<P>'Tis a mighty wrong thing, after all,
Lucy, that parents will educate creatures
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
so differently, who are to live with and for
each other.</P>
<P>Every possible means is used, even
from infancy, to soften the minds of wo∣men,
and to harden those of men; the
contrary endeavor might be of use, for
the men creatures are unfeeling enough
by nature, and we are born too trem∣blingly
alive to love, and indeed to every
soft affection.</P>
<P>Your brother is almost the only one
of his sex I know, who has the tender∣ness
of woman with the spirit and firm∣ness
of man: a circumstance which strikes
every woman who converses with him,
and which contributes to make him the
favorite he is amongst us. Foolish wo∣men
who cannot distinguish characters
may possibly give the preference to a
coxcomb; but I will venture to say,
no woman of sense was ever much ac∣quainted
with Colonel Rivers without
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
feeling for him an affection of some
kind or other.</P>
<P><HI>A propos</HI> to women, the estimable part
of us are divided into two classes only,
the tender and the lively.</P>
<P>The former, at the head of which I
place Emily, are infinitely more capable
of happiness; but, to counterbalance
this advantage, they are also capable of
misery in the same degree. We of the
other class, who feel less keenly, are per∣haps
upon the whole as happy, at least I
would fain think so.</P>
<P>For example, if Emily and I marry
our present lovers, she will certainly be
more exquisitely happy than I shall; but
if they should change their minds, or any
accident prevent our coming together, I
am inclined to fancy my situation would
be much the most agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="183"/>
I should pout a month, and then look
about for another lover; whilst the ten∣der
Emily would</P>
<LG>
<L>“Sit like patience on a monument,”</L>
</LG>
<P>and pine herself into a consumption.</P>

<P>Tuesday, midnight.</P>
<P>We have had a very agreeable day,
Lucy, a pretty enough kind of a ball,
and every body in good humor: I danced
with Fitzgerald, whom I never knew so
agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="184"/>
Happy love is gay, I find; Emily is all
sprightliness, your brother's eyes have
never left her one moment, and her
blushes seemed to shew her sense of the
distinction; I never knew her look so
handsome as this day.</P>
<P>Do you know I felt for Madame
Des Roches? Emily was excessively
complaisant to her: she returned her
civility, but I could perceive a kind
of constraint in her manner, very dif∣ferent
from the ease of her behaviour
when we saw her before: she felt the
attention of Rivers to Emily very
strongly: in short, the ladies seem∣ed
to have changed characters for the
day.</P>
<P>We supped with your brother on our
return, and from his windows, which
look on the river St. Charles, had the
pleasure of observing one of the most
beautiful objects imaginable, which I
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
never remember to have seen before this
evening.</P>
<P>You are to observe the winter method
of fishing here, is to break openings like
small fish ponds on the ice, to which the
fish coming for air, are taken in prodi∣gious
quantities on the surface.</P>
<P>To shelter themselves from the exces∣sive
cold of the night, the fishermen build
small houses of ice on the river, which
are arranged in a semicircular form, and
extend near a quarter of a mile, and
which, from the blazing fires within, have
a brilliant transparency and vivid lustre,
not easy either to imagine or to describe:
the starry semicircle looks like an immense
crescent of diamonds, on which the sun
darts his meridian rays.</P>
<P>Absolutely, Lucy, you see nothing in
Europe: you are cultivated, you have
the tame beauties of art; but to see na∣ture
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
in her lovely wild luxuriance, you
must visit your brother when he is prince

<DATELINE>Quebec, <DATE>April 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment, my dear, a
letter from Montreal, describing some
lands on Lake Champlain, which my
friend thinks much better worth my
taking than those near the Kamaraskas:
he presses me to come up immediately
to see them, as the ice on the rivers
will in a few days be dangerous to tra∣vel
on.</P>
<P>I am strongly inclined to go, and for
this reason; I am convinced my wish of
bringing about a friendship between
Emily and Madame Des Roches, the
strongest reason I had for fixing at the
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
Kamaraskas, was an imprudent one: gra∣titude
and (if the expression is not im∣pertinent)
compassion give me a softness
in my behaviour to the latter, which a
superficial observer would take for love,
and which her own tenderness may cause
even her to misconstrue; a circumstance
which must retard her resolution of
changing the affection with which she
has honored me, into friendship.</P>
<P>I am also delicate in my love, and
cannot bear to have it one moment sup∣posed,
my heart can know a wish but for
my Emily.</P>
<P>Shall I say more? The blush on
Emily's cheek on her first seeing Madame
Des Roches convinced me of my indis∣cretion,
and that vanity alone carried me
to desire to bring together two women,
whose affection for me is from their ex∣treme
merit so very flattering.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="189"/>
I shall certainly now fix in Canada; I
can no longer doubt of Emily's tender∣ness,
tho' she refuses me her hand, from
motives which make her a thousand times
more dear to me, but which I flatter my∣self
love will over-rule.</P>
<P>I am setting off in an hour for Mont∣real,
and shall call at Silleri to take
Emily's commands.</P>
<Q>Seven in the evening, Des Chambeaux.</Q>
<P>I asked her advice as to fixing the place
of my settlement; she said much against
my staying in America at all; but, if I
was determined, recommended Lake
Champlain rather than the Kamaraskas,
on account of climate. Bell smiled; and
a blush, which I perfectly understood,
overspread the lovely cheek of my sweet
Emily. Nothing could be more flatter∣ing
than this circumstance; had she seen
Madame Des Roches with a calm indif∣ference,
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
had she not been alarmed at the
idea of fixing near her, I should have
doubted of the degree of her affection; a
little apprehension is inseparable from
real love.</P>
<P>My courage has been to-day extremely
put to the proof: had I staid three days
longer, it would have been impossible to
have continued my journey.</P>
<P>The ice cracks under us at every step
the horses set, a rather unpleasant circum∣stance
on a river twenty fathom deep: I
should not have attempted the journey
had I been aware of this particular. I
hope no man meets inevitable danger
with more spirit, but no man is less fond
of seeking it where it is honorably to be
avoided.</P>
<P>I am going to sup with the seigneur of
the village, who is, I am told, married

that Temple's affection for you seems
rather to increase than lessen since your
marriage.</P>
<P>You ask me, my dear Lucy, how to
preserve this affection, on the continuance
of which, you justly say, your whole hap∣piness
depends.</P>
<P>The question is perhaps the most deli∣cate
and important which respects human
life; the caprice, the inconstancy, the
injustice of men, makes the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of wo∣men
in marriage infinitely difficult.</P>
<P>Prudence and virtue will certainly se∣cure
esteem; but unfortunately, esteem
alone will not make a happy marriage;
passion must also be kept alive, which the
continual presence of the object beloved
is too apt to make subside into that apa∣thy,
so insupportable to sensible minds.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="193"/>
The higher your rank, and the less your
manner of life separates you from each
other, the more danger there will be of
this indifference.</P>
<P>The poor, whose necessary avocations
divide them all day, and whose sensi∣bility
is blunted by the coarseness of
their education, are in no danger of
being weary of each other; and, unless
naturally vicious, you will see them ge∣nerally
happy in marriage; whereas even
the virtuous, in more affluent situations,
are not secure from this unhappy cessa∣tion
of tenderness.</P>
<P>When I received your letter, I was
reading Madame De Maintenon's advice
to the Duchess of Burgundy, on this
subject. I will transcribe so much of
it as relates to <HI>the woman,</HI> leaving her
advice to <HI>the princess</HI> to those whom it may
concern.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="194"/>
“Do not hope for perfect happiness;
there is no such thing in this sublunary
state.”</P>
<P>“Your sex is the more exposed to suf∣fer,
because it is always in depen∣dence:
be neither angry nor ashamed
of this dependence on a husband, nor
of any of those which are in the order
of Providence.”</P>
<P>“Let your husband be your best friend
and your only confidant.”</P>
<P>“Do not hope that your union will
procure you perfect peace: the best
marriages are those where with soft∣ness
and patience they bear by turns
with each other; there are none
without some contradiction and dis∣agreement.”</P>
<P>“Do not expect the same degree of
friendship that you feel: men are in
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
general less tender than women; and
you will be unhappy if you are too de∣licate
in friendship.”</P>
<P>“Beg of God to guard your heart
from jealousy: do not hope to bring
back a husband by complaints, ill hu∣mor,
and reproaches. The only means
which promise success, are patience
and softness: impatience sours and alie∣nates
hearts: softness leads them back
to their duty.”</P>
<P>“In sacrificing your own will, pretend
to no right over that of a husband:
men are more attached to theirs than
women, because educated with less
constraint.”</P>
<P>“They are naturally tyrannical; they
will have pleasures and liberty, yet
insist that women renounce both: do
not examine whether their rights are
well founded; let it suffice to you,
that they are established; they are
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
masters, we have only to suffer and obey
with a good grace.”</P>
<P>Thus far Madame De Maintenon,
who must be allowed to have known
the heart of man, since, after having
been above twenty years a widow, she
enflamed, even to the degree of bring∣ing
him to marry her, that of a great
monarch, younger than herself, sur∣rounded
by Beauties, habituated to flat∣tery,
in the plenitude of power, and
covered with glory; and retained him
in her chains to the last moments of his
life.</P>
<P>Do not, however, my dear, be alarmed
at the picture she has drawn of marriage;
nor fancy with her, that women are only
born to suffer and to obey.</P>
<P>That we are generally tyrannical, I
am obliged to own; but such of us as
know how to be happy, willingly give
up the harsh title of Master, for the more
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
tender and endearing one of Friend: Men
of sense abhor those customs which treat
your sex as if created merely for the
happiness of the other; a supposition
injurious to the Deity, though flat∣tering
to our tyranny and self-love; and
wish only to bind you in the soft chains
of affection.</P>
<P>Equality is the soul of friendship:
marriage, to give delight, must join two
minds, not devote a slave to the will of
an imperious lord; whatever conveys
the idea of subjection necessarily de∣stroys
that of love, of which I am so
convinced, that I have always wished the
word OBEY expunged from the marriage
ceremony.</P>
<P>If you will permit me to add my senti∣ments
to those of a lady so learned in the
art of pleasing; I would wish you to
study the taste of your husband, and en∣deavor
to acquire a relish for those plea∣sures
which appear most to affect him;
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
let him find amusement at home, but never
be peevish at his going abroad; he will re∣turn
to you with the higher gust for your
conversation: have separate apartments,
since your fortune makes it not inconve∣nient;
be always elegant, but not too ex∣pensive,
in your dress; retain your present
exquisite delicacy of every kind; receive
his friends with good-breeding and com∣placency;
contrive such little parties of
pleasure as you know are agreeable to
him, and with the most agreeable people
you can select: be lively even to playful∣ness
in your general turn of conversation
with him; but, at the same time, spare
no pains so to improve your understand∣ing,
which is an excellent one, as to be
no less capable of being the companion
of his graver hours: be ignorant of no∣thing
which it becomes your sex to
know, but avoid all affectation of know∣ledge:
let your oeconomy be exact, but
without appearing otherwise than by the
effect.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="199"/>
Do not imitate those of your sex who
by ill temper make a husband pay dear
for their fidelity; let virtue in you be
drest in smiles; and be assured that
chearfulness is the native garb of inno∣cence.</P>
<P>In one word, my dear, do not lose the
mistress in the wife, but let your beha∣viour
to him as a husband be such as you
would have thought most proper to attract
him as a lover: have always the idea of
pleasing before you, and you cannot fail
to please.</P>
<P>Having lectured you, my dear Lucy, I
must say a word to Temple: a great va∣riety
of rules have been given for the
conduct of women in marriage; scarce
any for that of men; as if it was not es∣sential
to domestic happiness, that the
man should preserve the heart of her with
whom he is to spend his life; or as if
bestowing happiness were not worth a
man's attention, so he possessed it: if,
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
however, it is possible to feel true happi∣ness
without giving it.</P>
<P>You, my dear Temple, have too just
an idea of pleasure to think in this man∣ner:
you would be beloved; it has been
the pursuit of your life, though never
really attained perhaps before. You at
present possess a heart full of sensibility,
a heart capable of loving with ardor,
and from the same cause as capable
of being estranged by neglect: give
your whole attention to preserving this
invaluable treasure; observe every rule
I have given to her, if you would be
happy; and believe me, the heart of wo∣man
is not less delicate than tender;
their sensibility is more keen, they feel
more strongly than we do, their tender∣ness
is more easily wounded, and their
hearts are more difficult to recover if
once lost.</P>
<P>At the same time, they are both
by nature and education more constant,
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
and scarce ever change the object of their
affections but from ill treatment: for
which reason there is some excuse for a
custom which appears cruel, that of
throwing contempt on the husband for
the ill conduct of the wife.</P>
<P>Above all things, retain the politeness
and attention of a lover; and avoid that
careless manner which wounds the va∣nity
of human nature, a passion given
us, as were all passions, for the wisest
ends, and which never quits us but with
life.</P>
<P>There is a certain attentive tender∣ness,
difficult to be described, which
the manly of our sex feel, and which
is peculiarly pleasing to woman: 'tis
also a very delightful sensation to our∣selves,
as well as productive of the
happiest consequences: regarding them
as creatures placed by Providence un∣der
our protection, and depending on
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
us for their happiness, is the strongest
possible tie of affection to a well-turned
mind.</P>
<P>If I did not know Lucy perfectly,
I should perhaps hesitate in the next
advice I am going to give you; which
is, to make her the confidante, and the
<HI>only</HI> confidante, of your gallantries, if
you are so unhappy as to be inadver∣tently
betrayed into any: her heart will
possibly be at first a little wounded
by the confession, but this proof of
perfect esteem will increase her friend∣ship
for you; she will regard your
error with compassion and indulgence,
and lead you gently back by her
endearing tenderness to honor and her∣self.</P>
<P>Of all tasks I detest that of giving ad∣vice:
you are therefore under infinite
obligation to me for this letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Earl of —.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING can be more true, my
Lord, than that poverty is ever the
inseparable companion of indolence.</P>
<P>I see proofs of it every moment before
me; with a soil fruitful beyond all be∣lief,
the Canadians are poor on lands
which are their own property, and for
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
which they pay only a trifling quit-rent
to their seigneurs.</P>
<P>This indolence appears in every thing:
you scarce see the meanest peasant walk∣ing;
even riding on horseback appears
to them a fatigue insupportable; you
see them lolling at ease, like their lazy
lords, in carrioles and calashes, according
to the season; a boy to guide the horse
on a seat in the front of the carriage,
too lazy even to take the trouble of driv∣ing
themselves, their hands in winter
folded in an immense muff, though per∣haps
their families are in want of bread
to eat at home.</P>
<P>The winter is passed in a mixture of
festivity and inaction; dancing and feast∣ing
in their gayer hours; in their graver
smoking, and drinking brandy, by the
side of a warm stove: and when obliged
to cultivate the ground in spring to pro∣cure
the means of subsistence, you see
them just turn the turf once lightly over,
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
and, without manuring the ground, or
even breaking the clods of earth, throw
in the seed in the same careless manner,
and leave the event to chance, without
troubling themselves further till it is fit to
reap.</P>
<P>I must, however, observe, as some al∣leviation,
that there is something in the
climate which strongly inclines both the
body and mind, but rather the latter, to
indolence: the heat of the summer,
though pleasing, enervates the very soul,
and gives a certain lassitude unfavorable
to industry; and the winter, at its ex∣treme,
binds up and chills all the active
faculties of the soul.</P>
<P>Add to this, that the general spirit of
amusement, so universal here in winter,
and so necessary to prevent the ill effects
of the season, gives a habit of dissipation
and pleasure, which makes labor doubly
irksome at its return.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206"/>
Their religion, to which they are ex∣tremely
bigoted, is another great bar, as
well to industry as population: their nu∣merous
festivals inure them to idleness;
their religious houses rob the state of
many subjects who might be highly use∣ful
at present, and at the same time retard
the increase of the colony.</P>
<P>Sloth and superstition equally counter-work
providence, and render the bounty
of Heaven of no effect.</P>
<P>I am surprized the French, who gene∣rally
make their religion subservient to
the purposes of policy, do not discou∣rage
convents, and lessen the number of
festivals, in the colonies, where both are
so peculiarly pernicious.</P>
<P>It is to this circumstance one may in
great measure attribute the superior in∣crease
of the British American settlements
compared to those of France: a religion
which encourages idleness, and makes
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
a virtue of celibacy, is particularly unfa∣vorable
to colonization.</P>
<P>However religious prejudice may have
been suffered to counterwork policy under
a French government, it is scarce to be
doubted that this cause of the poverty of
Canada will by degrees be removed; that
these people, slaves at present to igno∣rance
and superstition, will in time be
enlightened by a more liberal education,
and gently led by reason to a religion
which is not only preferable, as being that
of the country to which they are now
annexed, but which is so much more
calculated to make them happy and
prosperous as a people.</P>
<P>Till that time, till their prejudices sub∣side,
it is equally just, humane, and wise,
to leave them the free right of worship∣ing
the Deity in the manner which they
have been early taught to believe the best,
and to which they are consequently at∣tached.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208"/>
It would be unjust to deprive them of
any of the rights of citizens on account
of religion, in America, where every
other sect of dissenters are equally capable
of employ with those of the established
church; nay where, from whatever cause,
the church of England is on a footing in
many colonies little better than a tole∣ration.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly, in a political light, an
object of consequence every where, that
the national religion, whatever it is, should
be as universal as possible, agreement in
religious worship being the strongest tie
to unity and obedience: had all prudent
means been used to lessen the number of
dissenters in our colonies, I cannot avoid
believing, from what I observe and hear,
that we should have sound in them a spirit
of rational loyalty, and true freedom, in∣stead
of that factious one from which so
much is to be apprehended.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209"/>
It seems consonant to reason, that the
religion of every country should have a
relation to, and coherence with, the civil
constitution: the Romish religion is best
adapted to a despotic government, the
presbyterian to a republican, and that of
the church of England to a limited mo∣narchy
like ours.</P>
<P>As therefore the civil government of
America is on the same plan with that of
the mother country, it were to be wished
the religious establishment was also the
same, especially in those colonies where
the people are generally of the national
church; though with the fullest liberty of
conscience to dissenters of all denomina∣tions.</P>
<P>I would be clearly understood, my
Lord; from all I have observed here, I
am convinced, nothing would so much
contribute to diffuse a spirit of order, and
rational obedience, in the colonies, as the
appointment, under proper restrictions, of
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
bishops: I am equally convinced that
nothing would so much strengthen the
hands of government, or give such plea∣sure
to the well-affected in the colonies,
who are by much the most numerous, as
such an appointment, however clamored
against by a few abettors of sedition.</P>
<P>I am called upon for this letter, and
must remit to another time what I wished
to say more to your Lordship in regard to
this country.</P>

My Lord, &amp;c.

<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM indeed, Madam, this inconsistent
creature. I have at once refused to
marry Colonel Rivers, and owned to him
all the tenderness of my soul.</P>
<P>Do not however think me mad, or
suppose my refusal the effect of an un∣meaning
childish affectation of disinterest∣edness:
I can form to myself no idea of
happiness equal to that of spending my
life with Rivers, the best, the most ten∣der,
the most amiable of mankind; nor
can I support the idea of his marrying
any other woman: I would therefore
marry him to-morrow were it possible
without ruining him, without dooming
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
him to a perpetual exile, and obstructing
those views of honest ambition at home,
which become his birth, his connexions,
his talents, his time of life; and with
which, as his friend, it is my duty to
inspire him.</P>
<P>His affection for me at present blinds
him, he sees no object but me in the whole
universe; but shall I take advantage of
that inebriation of tenderness, to seduce
him into a measure inconsistent with his
real happiness and interest? He must re∣turn
to England, must pursue fortune in
that world for which he was formed: shall
his Emily retard him in the glorious race?
shall she not rather encourage him in
every laudable attempt? shall she suffer
him to hide that shining merit in the un∣cultivated
wilds of Canada, the seat of
barbarism and ignorance, which entitles
him to hope a happy fate in the dear land
of arts and arms?</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="213"/>
I entreat you to do all you can to dis∣courage
his design. Remind him that
his sister's marriage has in some degree
removed the cause of his coming hither;
that he can have now no motive for
fixing here, but his tenderness for me;
that I shall be justly blamed by all who
love him for keeping him here. Tell
him, I will not marry him in Canada;
that his stay makes the best-mother in the
world wretched; that he owes his return
to himself, nay to his Emily, whose
whole heart is set on seeing him in a
situation worthy of him: though without
ambition as to myself, I am proud, I am
ambitious for him; if he loves me, he
will gratify that pride, that ambition;
and leave Canada to those whose duty
confines them here, or whose interest
it is to remain unseen. Let him not
once think of me in his determination:
I am content to be beloved, and will
leave all else to time. You cannot so
much oblige or serve me, as by per∣suading

<P>YOUR brother, my dear, is gone to
Montreal to look out for a settle∣ment,

Quebec, with a lady she knew in Eng∣land,
who is lately arrived from thence
by New York.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215"/>
I am lost without my friend, though
my lover endeavors in some degree to
supply her place; he lays close siege; I
know not how long I shall be able to
hold out: this fine weather is exceed∣ingly
in his favor; the winter freezes
up all the avenues to the heart; but
this sprightly April sun thaws them

<P>I can see papa is vastly in Fitzgerald's
interest; but he knows our sex well
enough to keep this to himself.</P>
<P>I shall, however, for decency's sake,

<P>DO you think, my dear, that Madame
Des Roches has heard from Rivers?
I wish you would ask her this afternoon at
the governor's: I am anxious to know, but
ashamed to enquire.</P>
<P>Not, my dear, that I have the weakness
to be jealous; but I shall think his letter
to me a higher compliment, if I know he
writes to nobody else. I extremely approve
his friendship for Madame Des Roches;
she is very amiable, and certainly deserves
it: but you know, Bell, it would be cruel
to encourage an affection, which she must
conquer, or be unhappy: if she did not
love him, there would be nothing wrong
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
in his writing to her; but, as she does, it
would be doing her the greatest injury
possible: 'tis as much on her account as
my own I am thus anxious.</P>
<P>Did you ever read so tender, yet so live∣ly
a letter as Rivers's to me? he is alike in
all: there is in his letters, as in his con∣versation,</P>
<LG>
<L>“All that can softly win, or gaily charm</L>
<L>The heart of woman.”</L>
</LG>
<P>Even strangers listen to him with an in∣voluntary
attention, and hear him with a
pleasure for which they scarce know how
to account.</P>
<P>He charms even without intending it,
and in spite of himself; but when he
wishes to please, when he addresses the
woman he loves, when his eyes speak the
soft language of his heart, when your
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
Emily reads in them the dear confession
of his tenderness, when that melodious
voice utters the sentiments of the noblest
mind that ever animated a human form—
My dearest, the eloquence of angels can∣not
paint my Rivers as he is.</P>
<P>I am almost inclined not to go to the
governor's to-night; I am determined not
to dance till Rivers returns, and I know
there are too many who will be ready to
make observations on my refusal: I think
I will stay at home, and write to him
against Monday's post: I have a thousand

<P>I shall call upon you at six o'clock, and

<DATELINE>Quebec, Saturday morning.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW unjust have I been in my hatred
of Madame Des Roches! she spent
yesterday with us, and after dinner desired
to converse with me an hour in my apart∣ment,
where she opened to me all her
heart on the subject of her love for
Rivers.</P>
<P>She is the noblest and most amiable of
women, and I have been in regard to her
the most capricious and unjust: my hatred
of her was unworthy my character; I
blush to own the meanness of my senti∣ments,
whilst I admire the generosity of
hers.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="223"/>
Why, my dear, should I have hated
her? she was unhappy, and deserved
rather my compassion: I had deprived
her of all hope of being beloved, it was
too much to wish to deprive her also of
his conversation. I knew myself the
only object of Rivers's love; why then
should I have envied her his friend∣ship?
she had the strongest reason to hate
me, but I should have loved and pitied
her.</P>
<P>Can there be a misfortune equal to
that of loving Rivers without hope of
a return? Yet she has not only borne
this misfortune without complaint, but
has been the confidante of his passion for
another; he owned to her all his ten∣derness
for me, and drew a picture of
me, “which, she told me, ought, had
she listened to reason, to have destroyed
even the shadow of hope: but that love,
ever ready to flatter and deceive, had
betrayed her into the weakness of sup∣posing
it possible I might refuse him,
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
and that gratitude might, in that case,
touch his heart with tenderness for one
who loved him with the most pure and
disinterested affection; that her journey
to Quebec had removed the veil love
had placed between her and truth; that
she was now convinced the saint hope
she had encouraged was madness, and
that our souls were formed for each
other.</P>
<P>She owned she still loved him with
the most lively affection; yet assured me,
since she was not allowed to make the
most amiable of mankind happy her∣self,
she wished him to be so with the
woman on earth she thought most worthy
of him.</P>
<P>She added, that she had on first seeing
me, though she thought me worthy his
heart, felt an impulse of dislike which
she was ashamed to own, even now that
reason and reflexion had conquered so
unworthy a sentiment; that Rivers's
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
complaisance had a little dissipated her
chagrin, and enabled her to behave to me
in the manner she did: that she had,
however, almost hated me at the ball in
the country: that the tenderness in Ri∣vers's
eyes that day whenever they met
mine, and his comparative inartention to
her, had wounded her to the soul.</P>
<P>That this preference had, however,
been salutary, though painful; since it
had determined her to conquer a passion,
which could only make her life wretched
if it continued; that, as the first step
to this conquest, she had resolved to see
him no more: that she would return to
her house the moment she could cross
the river with safety; and conjured me,
for her sake, to persuade him to give up
all thoughts of a settlement near her;
that she could not answer for her own
heart if she continued to see him; that
she believed in love there was no safety
but in slight.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="226"/>
That his absence had given her time to
think coolly; and that she now saw so
strongly the amiableness of my character,
and was so convinced of my perfect ten∣derness
for him, that she should hate
herself were she capable of wishing to in∣terrupt
our happiness.</P>
<P>That she hoped I would pardon her re∣taining
a tender remembrance of a man
who, had he never seen me, might have
returned her affection; that she thought
so highly of my heart, as to believe I
could not hate a woman who esteemed
me, and who solicited my friendship,
though a happy rival.”</P>
<P>I was touched, even to tears, at her
behaviour: we embraced; and, if I
know my own weak foolish heart, I love
her.</P>
<P>She talks of leaving Quebec before
Rivers's return; she said, her coming
was an imprudence which only love
<PB N="225" REF="227"/>
could excuse; and that she had no mo∣tive
for her journey but the desire of
seeing him, which was so lively as to
hurry her into an indiscretion of which
she was afraid the world took but too
much notice. What openness, what sin∣cerity,
what generosity, was there in all
she said!</P>
<P>How superior, my dear, is her cha∣racter
to mine! I blush for myself on the
comparison; I am shocked to see how
much she soars above me: how is it
possible Rivers should not have pre∣ferred
her to me? Yet this is the wo∣man
I fancied incapable of any passion
but vanity.</P>
<P>I am sure, my dear Bell, I am not na∣turally
envious of the merit of others;
but my excess of love for Rivers makes
me apprehensive of every woman who
can possibly rival me in his tenderness.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="228"/>
I was hurt at Madame Des Roches's
uncommon merit; I saw with pain the
amiable qualities of her mind; I could
scarce even allow her person to be pleas∣ing:
but this injustice is not that of my
natural temper, but of love.</P>
<P>She is certainly right, my dear, to see
him no more; I applaud, I admire her
resolution: do you think, however, she
would pursue it if she loved as I do? she
has perhaps loved before, and her heart
has lost something of its native trembling
sensibility.</P>
<P>I wish my heart felt her merit as
strongly as my reason: I esteem, I ad∣mire,
I even love her at present; but I
am convinced Rivers's return while she
continues here would weaken these senti∣ments
of affection: the least appearance
of preference, even for a moment, would
make me relapse into my former weak∣ness.
I adore, I idolize her character; but
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
I cannot sincerely wish to cultivate her
friendship.</P>
<P>Let me see you this afternoon at Que∣bec;
I am told the roads will not be
passable for carrioles above three days
longer: let me therefore see you as often
as I can before we are absolutely shut
from each other.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the Earl of—.
<DATELINE>Silleri, <DATE>April 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ENGLAND, however populous, is
undoubtedly, my Lord, too small to
afford very large supplies of people to
her colonies: and her people are also too
useful, and of too much value, to be
suffered to emigrate, if they can be pre∣vented,
whilst there is sufficient employ∣ment
for them at home.</P>
<P>It is not only our interest to have colo∣nies;
they are not only necessary to our
commerce, and our greatest and surest
sources of wealth, but our very being as
a powerful commercial nation depends
on them: it is therefore an object of all
others most worthy our attention, that
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
they should be as flourishing and popu∣lous
as possible.</P>
<P>It is however equally our interest to
support them at as little expence of our
own inhabitants as possible: I therefore
look on the acquisition of such a number
of subjects as we found in Canada, to be a
much superior advantage to that of gain∣ing
ten times the immense tract of land
ceded to us, if uncultivated and destitute
of inhabitants.</P>
<P>But it is not only contrary to our in∣terest
to spare many of our own people
as settlers in America; it must also be
considered, that, if we could spare them,
the English are the worst settlers on new
lands in the universe.</P>
<P>Their attachment to their native coun∣try,
especially amongst the lower ranks
of people, is so very strong, that few of
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
the honest and industrious can be pre∣vailed
on to leave it; those therefore who
go, are generally the dissolute and the
idle, who are of no use any where.</P>
<P>The English are also, though industri∣ous,
active, and enterprizing, ill fitted
to bear the hardships, and submit to
the wants, which inevitably attend an
infant settlement even on the most fruit∣ful
lands.</P>
<P>The Germans, on the contrary, with the
same useful qualities, have a patience, a
perseverance, an abstinence, which peculi∣arly
fit them for the cultivation of new
countries; too great encouragement there∣fore
cannot be given to them to settle in
our colonies: they make better settlers
than our own people; and at the same time
their numbers are an acquisition of real
strength where they fix, without weaken∣ing
the mother country.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="233"/>
It is long since the populousness of
Europe has been the cause of her sending
out colonies: a better policy prevails;
mankind are enlightened; we are now
convinced, both by reason and experience,
that no industrious people can be too po∣pulous.</P>
<P>The northern swarms were compelled
to leave their respective countries, not
because those countries were unable to
support them, but because they were too
idle to cultivate the ground: they were
a ferocious, ignorant, barbarous people,
averse to labor, attached to war, and,
like our American savages, believing
every employment not relative to this
favorite object, beneath the dignity of
man.</P>
<P>Their emigrations therefore were less
owing to their populousness, than to their
want of industry, and barbarous contempt
of agriculture and every useful art.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="234"/>
It is with pain I am compelled to say,
the late spirit of encouraging the mono∣poly
of farms, which, from a narrow
short-sighted policy, prevails amongst our
landed men at home, and the alarming
growth of celibacy amongst the peasantry,
which is its necessary consequence, to say
nothing of the same ruinous increase of
celibacy in higher ranks, threaten us with
such a decrease of population, as will
probably equal that caused by the rava∣ges
of those scourges of Heaven, the sword,
the famine, and the pestilence.</P>
<P>If this selfish policy continues to extend
itself, we shall in a few years be so far from
being able to send emigrants to America,
that we shall be reduced to solicit their
return, and that of their posterity, to pre∣vent
England's becoming in its turn an
uncultivated desart.</P>
<P>But to return to Canada; this large ac∣quisition
of people is an invaluable trea∣sure,
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
if managed, as I doubt not it will
be, to the best advantage; if they are
won by the gentle arts of persuasion, and
the gradual progress of knowledge, to
adopt so much of our manners as tends
to make them happier in themselves, and
more useful members of the society to
which they belong: if with our language,
which they should by every means be in∣duced
to learn, they acquire the mild ge∣nius
of our religion and laws, and that
spirit of industry, enterprize, and com∣merce,
to which we owe all our greatness.</P>
<P>Amongst the various causes which con∣cur
to render France more populous than
England, notwithstanding the disadvantage
of a less gentle government, and a religion
so very unfavorable to the increase of man∣kind,
the cultivation of vineyards may be
reckoned a principal one; as it employs
a much greater number of hands than
even agriculture itself, which has how∣ever
infinite advantages in this respect
above pasturage, the certain cause of a
<PB N="234" REF="236"/>
want of people wherever it prevails above
its due proportion.</P>
<P>Our climate denies us the advantages
arising from the culture of vines, as well
as many others which nature has accorded
to France; a consideration which should
awaken us from the lethargy into which
the avarice of individuals has plunged us,
and set us in earnest on improving every
advantage we enjoy, in order to secure us
by our native strength from so formidable
a rival.</P>
<P>The want of bread to eat, from the late
false and cruel policy of laying small farms
into great ones, and the general discou∣ragement
of tillage which is its conse∣quence,
is in my opinion much less to be
apprehended than the want of people to
eat it.</P>
<P>In every country where the inhabitants
are at once numerous and industrious,
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
there will always be a proportionable cul∣tivation.</P>
<P>This evil is so very destructive and a∣larming,
that, if the great have not virtue
enough to remedy it, it is to be hoped it
will in time, like most great evils, cure
itself.</P>
<P>Your Lordship enquires into the nature
of this climate in respect to health. The air
being uncommonly pure and serene, it is
favorable to life beyond any I ever knew:
the people live generally to a very ad∣vanced
age; and are remarkably free from
diseases of every kind, except consump∣tions,
to which the younger part of the in∣habitants
are a good deal subject.</P>
<P>It is however a circumstance one cannot
help observing, that they begin to look old
much sooner than the people in Europe;
on which my daughter observes, that it is
not very pleasant for women to come to
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
reside in a country where people have a
short youth, and a long old age.</P>
<P>The diseases of cold countries are in
general owing to want of perspiration; for
which reason exercise, and even dissipation,
are here the best medicines.</P>
<P>The Indians therefore shewed their
good sense in advising the French, on their
first arrival, to use dancing, mirth, chear∣fulness,
and content, as the best remedies
against the inconveniences of the climate.</P>
<P>I have already swelled this letter to such
a length, that I must postpone to another
time my account of the peculiar natural
productions of Canada; only observing,
that one would imagine Heaven intended a
social intercourse between the most distant
nations, by giving them productions of the
earth so very different each from the other,
and each more than sufficient for itself,
that the exchange might be the means of
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
spreading the bond of society and brother∣hood
over the whole globe.</P>
<P>In my opinion, the man who conveys,
and causes to grow, in any country, a
grain, a fruit, or even a flower, it never
possessed before, deserves more praise than
a thousand heroes: he is a benefactor, he
is in some degree a creator.</P>
<P>I have the honor to be,</P>

Your Lordship's &amp;c.

<DATELINE>Montreal, <DATE>April 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IS it possible, my dear Emily, you can,
after all I have said, persist in endea∣voring
to dissuade me from a design on
which my whole happiness depends, and
which I flattered myself was equally essen∣tial
to yours? I forgave, I even admired,
your first scruple; I thought it genero∣sity:
but I have answered it; and if you
had loved as I do, you would never again
have named so unpleasing a subject.</P>
<P>Does your own heart tell you mine will
call a settlement here, with you, an exile?
Examine yourself well, and tell me whe∣ther
your aversion to staying in Canada is
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
not stronger than your tenderness for your
Rivers.</P>
<P>I am hurt beyond all words at the
earnestness with which you press Mrs.
Melmoth to dissuade me from staying in
this country: you press with warmth my
return to England, though it would put
an eternal bar between us: you give rea∣sons
which, though the understanding
may approve, the heart abhors: can am∣bition
come in competition with tender∣ness?
you fancy yourself generous, when
you are only indifferent. Insensible girl!
you know nothing of love.</P>
<P>Write to me instantly, and tell me every
emotion of your soul, for I tremble at the
idea that your affection is less lively than
mine.</P>
<P>Adieu! I am wretched till I hear from
you. Is it possible, my Emily, you can
have ceased to love him, who, as you
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
yourself own, sees no other object than
you in the universe?</P>
<CLOSER>Adieu! Yours,
<SIGNED>ED. RIVERS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>You know not the heart of your
Rivers, if you suppose it capable
of any ambition but that dear one
of being beloved by you.</P>
<P>What have you said, my dear Emily?
<HI>You will not marry me in Canada.</HI> You
have passed a hard sentence on me:
you know my fortune will not al∣low
me to marry you in England.</P>
