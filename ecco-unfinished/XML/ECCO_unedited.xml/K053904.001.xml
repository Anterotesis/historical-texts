<HEAD>THE
ITALIAN,
OR THE
CONFESSIONAL of the BLACK PENITENTS.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the year 1764, some English
travellers in Italy, during one of their ex∣cursions
in the environs of Naples, happen∣ed
to stop before the portico of the <HI>Santa
Maria del Pianto,</HI> a church belonging to
a very ancient convent of the order of the
<HI>Black Penitents.</HI> The magnificence of this
portico, though impaired by time, excited
so much admiration, that the travellers
were curious to survey the structure to
which it belonged, and with this intention
they ascended the marble steps that led to
it.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
Within the shade of the portico, a person
with folded arms, and eyes directed to∣wards
the ground, was pacing behind the
pillars the whole extent of the pavement,
and was apparently so engaged by his own
thoughts, as not to observe that strangers
were approaching. He turned, however,
suddenly, as if startled by the sound of
steps, and then, without further pausing,
glided to a door that opened into the
church, and disappeared.</P>
<P>There was something too extraordinary
in the figure of this man, and too singular
in his conduct, to pass unnoticed by the
visitors. He was of a tall thin figure,
bending forward from the shoulders; of a
sallow complexion, and harsh features, and
had an eye, which, as it looked up from
the cloke that muffled the lower part of his
countenance, seemed expressive of uncom∣mon
ferocity.</P>
<P>The travellers, on entering the church,
looked round for the stranger, who had
<PB N="v" REF="4" MS="y"/>
passed thither before them, but he was no
where to be seen, and, through all the shade
of the long aisles, only one other person ap∣peared.
This was a friar of the adjoining con∣vent,
who sometimes pointed out to strangers
the objects in the church, which were most
worthy of attention, and who now, with this
design, approached the party that had just
entered.</P>
<P>The interior of this edifice had nothing
of the shewy ornament and general splen∣dor,
which distinguish the churches of
Italy, and particularly those of Naples; but
it exhibited a simplicity and grandeur of
design, considerably more interesting to
persons of taste, and a solemnity of light
and shade much more suitable to promote
the sublime elevation of devotion.</P>
<P>When the party had viewed the different
shrines and whatever had been judged
worthy of observation, and were returning
through an obscure aisle towards the por∣tico,
they perceived the person who had
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
appeared upon the steps, passing towards
a confessional on the left, and, as he entered
it, one of the party pointed him out to the
friar, and enquired who he was; the friar
turning to look after him, did not imme∣diately
reply, but, on the question being
repeated, he inclined his head, as in a kind
of obeisance, and calmly replied, “He is
an assassin.”</P>
<P>“An assassin!” exclaimed one of the
Englishmen; “an assassin and at liberty!”</P>
<P>An Italian gentleman, who was of the
party, smiled at the astonishment of his
friend.</P>
<P>“He has sought sanctuary here,” re∣plied
the friar; “within these walls he may
not be hurt.”</P>
<P>“Do your altars, then, protect the mur∣derer?”
said the Englishman.</P>
<P>“He could find shelter no where else,”
answered the friar meekly.</P>
<P>“This is astonishing!” said the Eng∣lishman;
“of what avail are your laws,
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
if the most atrocious criminal may thus
find shelter from them? But how does he
contrive to exist here! He is, at least, in
danger of being starved?”</P>
<P>“Pardon me,” replied the friar; “there
are always people willing to assist those,
who cannot assist themselves; and as the
criminal may not leave the church in
search of food, they bring it to him
here.”</P>
<P>“Is this possible!” said the Englishman,
turning to his Italian friend.</P>
<P>“Why, the poor wretch must not
starve,” replied the friend; “which he
inevitably would do, if food were not
brought to him! But have you never,
since your arrival in Italy, happened to see
a person in the situation of this man?
It is by no means an uncommon one.”</P>
<P>“Never!” answered the Englishman,
“and I can scarcely credit what I see
now!”</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
“Why, my friend,” observed the Ita∣lian,
“if we were to shew no mercy to
such unfortunate persons, assassinations are
so frequent, that our cities would be half
depopulated.”</P>
<P>In notice of this profound remark, the
Englishman could only gravely bow.</P>
<P>“But observe yonder confessional,”
added the Italian, “that beyond the pillars
on the left of the aisle, below a painted
window. Have you discovered it? The
colours of the glass throw, instead of light,
a shade over that part of the church, which,
perhaps, prevents your distinguishing what
I mean!”</P>
<P>The Englishman looked whither his
friend pointed, and observed a confessional
of oak, or some very dark wood, adjoining
the wall, and remarked, also, that it was the
same, which the assassin had just entered.
It consisted of three compartments, covered
with a black canopy. In the central division
was the chair of the confessor, elevated by
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
several steps above the pavement of the
church; and on either hand was a small
closet, or box, with steps leading up to a
grated partition, at which the penitent
might kneel, and, concealed from observa∣tion,
pour into the ear of the confessor, the
consciousness of crimes that lay heavy on
his heart.</P>
<P>“You observe it?” said the Italian.</P>
<P>“I do,” replied the Englishman; “it
is the same, which the assassin has passed into;
and I think it one of the most gloomy spots
I ever beheld; the view of it is enough to
strike a criminal with despair!”</P>
<P>“We, in Italy, are not so apt to des∣pair,”
replied the Italian smilingly.</P>
<P>“Well, but what of this confessional?”
enquired the Englishman. “The assassin
entered it!”</P>
<P>“He has no relation, with what I am about
to mention,” said the Italian; “but I wish
you to mark the place, because some very
extraordinary circumstances belong to it.”</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9"/>
“What are they?” said the English∣man.</P>
<P>“It is now several years since the confes∣sion,
which is connected with them, was made
at that very confessional,” added the Italian;
“the view of it, and the sight of this assassin,
with your surprize at the liberty which is
allowed him, led me to a recollection of the
story. When you return to the hotel, I
will communicate it to you, if you have no
pleasanter way of engaging your time.</P>
<P>“I have a curiosity to hear it,” replied
the Englishman, “cannot you relate it
now?”</P>
<P>“It is much too long to be related now;
that would occupy a week; I have it in
writing, and will send you the volume. A
young student of Padua, who happened to
be at Naples soon after this horrible confes∣sion
became public”—</P>
<P>“Pardon me,” interrupted the English∣man,
“that is surely very extraordinary?
I thought confessions were always held
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
sacred by the priest, to whom they were
made.”</P>
<P>“Your observation is reasonable,” re∣joined
the Italian; “the faith of the priest is
never broken, except by an especial com∣mand
from an higher power; and the cir∣cumstances
must even then be very extraor∣dinary
to justify such a departure from the
law. But, when you read the narrative,
your surprise on this head will cease. I
was going to tell you, that it was written by
a student of Padua, who, happening to be
here soon after the affair became public, was
so much struck with the facts, that, partly,
as an exercise, and partly in return for some
trifling services I had rendered him, he com∣mitted
them to paper for me. You will per∣ceive
from the work, that this student was
very young, as to the arts of composition,
but the facts are what you require, and from
these he has not deviated. But come, let
us leave the church.”</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
“After I have taken another view of this
solemn edifice,” replied the Englishman,
“and particularly of the confessional you
have pointed to my notice!”</P>
<P>While the Englishman glanced his eye
over the high roofs, and along the solemn
perspectives of the Santa del Pianto, he per∣ceived
the figure of the assassin stealing from
the confessional across the choir, and, shock∣ed
on again beholding him, he turned his
eyes, and hastily quitted the church.</P>
<P>The friends then separated, and the
Englishman, soon after returning to his
hotel, received the volume. He read as

<Q><L>“What is this secret sin; this untold tale,</L>
<L>That art cannot extract, nor penance cleanse?”</L>
<BIBL>MYSTERIOUS MOTHER.</BIBL></Q>
<P>IT was in the church of San Lorenzo at
Naples, in the year 1758, that Vincentio di
Vivaldi first saw Eliena Rosalba. The
sweetness and fine expression of her voice at∣tracted
his attention to her figure, which had
a distinguished air of delicacy and grace; but
her face was concealed in her veil. So much
indeed was he fascinated by the voice, that a
most painful curiosity was excited as to her
countenance, which he fancied must express
all the sensibility of character that the mo∣dulation
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
of her tones indicated. He listen∣ed
to their exquisite expression with a rapt
attention, and hardly withdrew his eyes
from her person till the matin servicae had
concluded; when he observed her leave the
church with an aged lady, who leaned upon
her arm, and who appeared to be her mo∣ther.</P>
<P>Vivaldi immediately followed their steps,
determined to obtain, if possible, a view of
Ellena's face, and to discover the home to
which she should retire. They walked
quickly, looking neither to the right or
left, and as they turned into the Strada
di Toledo he had nearly lost them; but
quickening his pace, and relinquishing the
cautious distance he had hitherto kept, he
overtook them as they entered on the Ter∣razzo
Nuovo, which runs along the bay of
Naples, and leads towards the Gran Corso.
He overtook them; but the fair unknown
still held her veil close, and he knew not
how to introduce himself to her notice, or
to obtain a view of the features, which ex∣cited
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
his curiosity. He was embarrassed by
a respectful timidity, that mingled with his
admiration, and which kept him silent, not∣withstanding
his wish to speak.</P>
<P>In descending the last steps of the <HI>Ter∣razzo,</HI>
however, the foot of the elder lady
faltered, and, while Vivaldi hastened to assist
her, the breeze from the water caught the
veil, which Ellena had no longer a hand
sufficiently disengaged to confine, and, waft∣ing
it partially aside, disclosed to him a coun∣tenance
more touchingly beautiful than
he had dared to image. Her features were
of the Grecian outline, and, though they
expressed the tranquillity of an elegant
mind, her dark blue eyes sparkled with in∣telligence.
She was assisting her companion
so anxiously, that she did not immediately
observe the admiration she had inspired;
but the moment her eyes met those of
Vivaldi, she became conscious of their effect,
and she hastily drew her veil.</P>
<P>The old lady was not materially hurt by
her fall, but, as she walked difficultly, Vivaldi
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
seized the opportunity thus offered, and
insisted that she should accept his arm.
She refused this with many acknowledg∣ments;
but he pressed the offer so repeat∣edly
and respectfully, that, at length, she
accepted it, and they walked towards her
residence together.</P>
<P>On the way thither, he attempted to con∣verse
with Ellena, but her replies were
concise, and he arrived at the end of the
walk while he was yet considering what he
could say, that might interest and withdraw
her from this severe reserve. From the
style of their residence, he imagined that
they were persons of honourable, but mo∣derate
independence. The house was small,
but exhibited an air of comfort, and even
of taste. It stood on an eminence, sur∣rounded,
by a garden and vineyards, which
commanded the city and bay of Naples, an
ever-moving picture, and was canopied by
a thick grove of pines and majestic date∣trees;
and, though the little portico and
collonade in front were of common marble,
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
the style of architecture was elegant. While
they afforded a shelter from the, sun, they
admitted the cooling breezes that rose from
the bay below, and a prospect of the whole
scope of its enchanting shores.</P>
<P>Vivaldi stopped at the little gate, which
led into the garden, where the elder lady
repeated her acknowledgments for his care,
but did not invite him to enter; and he,
trembling with anxiety and sinking with
disappointment, remained for a moment
gazing upon Ellena, unable to take leave,
yet irresolute what to say that might prolong
the interview, till the old lady again bade
him good-day. He then summoned cou∣rage
enough to request he might be allowed
to enquire after her health, and, having
obtained her permission, his eyes bade adieu
to Ellena, who, as they were parting, ven∣tured
to thank him for the care he had
taken of her aunt. The sound of her voice,
and this acknowledgment of obligation,
made him less willing to go than before,
but at length he tore himself away. The
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
beauty of her countenance haunting his
imagination, and the touching accents of
her voice still vibrating on his heart, he de∣scended
to the shore below her residence,
pleasing himself with the consciousness of
being near her, though he could no longer
behold her; and sometimes hoping that he
might again see her, however distantly, in
a balcony of the house, where the silk
awning seemed to invite the breeze from
the sea. He lingered hour after hour,
stretched beneath the umbrageous, pines
that waved over the shore, or traversing,
regardless of the heat, the base of the cliffs
that crowned it; recalling to his fancy the
enchantment of her smile, and seeming still
to listen to the sweetness of her accents.</P>
<P>In the evening he returned to his father's
palace at Naples, thoughtful yet pleased,
anxious yet happy; dwelling with delight∣ful
hope on the remembrance of the thanks
he had received from Ellena, yet not daring
to form any plan as to his future conduct.
He returned time enough to attend his
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
mother in her evening ride on the Corso,
where, in every gay carriage that passed, he
hoped to see the object of his constant
thought; but she did not appear. His
mother, the Marchesa di Vivaldi, observed
his anxiety and unusual silence, and asked
him some questions, which she meant should
lead to an explanation of the change in his
manners; but his replies only excited a
stronger curiosity, and, though she forbore
to press her enquiries, it was probable that
she might employ a more artful means of
renewing them.</P>
<P>Vincentio di Vivaldi was the only son of
the Marchese di Vivaldi, a nobleman of one
of the most ancient families of the king∣dom
of Naples, a favourite possessing an un∣common
share of influence at Court, and a
man still higher in power than in rank.
His pride of birth was equal to either, but
it was mingled with the justifiable pride of
a principled mind; it governed his conduct
in morals as well as in the jealousy of cere∣monial
distinctions, and elevated his prac∣tice
<PB N="8" REF="19"/>
as well as his claims. His pride was
at once his vice and his virtue, his safe∣guard
and his weakness.</P>
<P>The mother of Vivaldi, descended from
a family as ancient as that of his father,
was equally jealous of her importance; but
her pride was that of birth and distinction,
without extending to morals. She was of
violent passions, haughty, vindictive, yet
crafty and deceitful; patient in stratagem,
and indefatigable in pursuit of vengeance,
on the unhappy objects who provoked her
resentment. She loved her son, rather as
being the last of two illustrious houses, who
was to re-unite and support the honour of
both, than with the fondness of a mother.</P>
<P>Vincentio inherited much of the charac∣ter
of his father, and very little of that of
his mother. His pride was as noble and
generous as that of the Marchese; but he
had somewhat of the fiery passions of the
Marchesa, without any of her craft, her
duplicity, or vindictive thirst of revenge.
Frank in his temper, ingenuous in his sen∣timents,
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
quickly offended, hut easily ap∣peased;
irritated by any, appearance of dis∣respect,
but melted by a concession, a high
sense of honor rendered him no more jealous
of offence, than a delicate humanity made
him ready for reconciliation, and anxious
to spare the feelings of others.</P>
<P>On the day following that, on which
he had seen Ellena, he returned to the villa
Altieri, to use the permission granted him
of enquiring after the health of Signora
Bianchi. The expectation of seeing Ellena
agitated him with impatient joy and trem∣bling
hope, which still encreased as he ap∣proached
her residence, till, having reached
the garden-gate, he was obliged to rest for
a few moments to recover breath and com∣posure.</P>
<P>Having announced himself to an old
female servant, who came to the gate, he
was soon after admitted to a small vestibule,
where he found Signora Bianchi winding
balls of silk, and alone; though from the
position of a chair which stood near a frame
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
for embroidery, he judged that Ellena had
but just quitted the apartment. Signora
Bianchi received him with a reserved polite∣ness,
and seemed very cautious in her re∣plies
to his enquiries after her niece, who,
he hoped, every moment, would appear.
He lengthened his visit till there was no
longer an excuse for doing so; till he had ex∣hausted
every topic of conversation, and till
the silence of Signora Bianchi seemed to
hint, that his departure was expected. With
a heart saddened by disappointment, and
having obtained only a reluctant permis∣sion
to enquire after the health of that lady
on some future day, he then took leave.</P>
<P>On his way through the garden he often
paused to look back upon the house, hoping
to obtain a glimpse of Ellena at a lattice;
and threw a glance around him, almost ex∣pecting
to see her seated beneath the shade
of the luxuriant plantains; but his search
was every where vain, and he quitted the
place with the slow and heavy step of de∣spondency.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="22"/>
The day was employed in endeavours to
obtain intelligence concerning the family of
Ellena, but of this he procured little that
was satisfactory. He was told, that she was
an orphan, living under the care of her aunt,
Signora Bianchi; that her family, which
had never been illustrious, was decayed in
fortune, and that her only dependence was
upon this aunt. But he was ignorant of
what was very true, though very secret, that
she assisted to support this aged relative,
whose sole property was the small estate on
which they lived, and that she passed whole
days in embroidering silks, which were dis∣posed
of to the nuns of a neighbouring con∣vent,
who sold them to the Neapolitan
ladies, that visited their grate, at a very
high advantage. He little thought, that a
beautiful robe, which he had often seen his
mother wear, was worked by Ellena; nor
that some copies from the antique, which
ornamented a cabinet of the Vivaldi palace
were drawn by her hand. If he had known
these circumstances, they would, only have
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
served to encrease the passion, which,
since they were proofs of a disparity of for∣tune,
that would certainly render his family
repugnant to a connection, with hers, it
would have been prudent to discourage.</P>
<P>Ellena could have endured poverty, but
not contempt; and it was to protect her∣self
from this effect of the narrow prejudices
of the world around her, that she had so
cautiously concealed from it a knowledge of
the industry, which did honor to her cha∣racter.
She was not ashamed of poverty,
or of the industry which overcame it, but
her spirit shrunk from the senseless smile
and humiliating condescension, which pro∣sperity
sometimes gives to indigence. Her
mind was not yet strong enough, or her
views sufficiently enlarged, to teach her a
contempt of the sneer of vicious folly, and
to glory in the dignity of virtuous inde∣pendence.
Ellena was the sole support of
her aunt's declining years; was patient to
her infirmities, and consoling to her suffer∣ings;
and repaid the fondness of a mother
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
with the affection of a daughter. Her mo∣ther
she had never known, having lost her
while she was an infant, and from that pe∣riod
Signora Bianchi had performed the
duties of one for her.</P>
<P>Thus innocent and happy in the silent
performance of her duties and in the veil of
retirement, lived Ellena Rosalba, when she
first saw Vincentio di Vivaldi. He was not
of a figure to pass unobserved when seen,
and Ellena had been struck by the spirit
and dignity of his air, and by his counte∣nance,
so frank, noble, and full of that kind
of expression, which announces the ener∣gies
of the soul. But she was cautious of
admitting a sentiment more tender than ad∣miration,
and endeavoured to dismiss his
image from her mind, and by engaging in
her usual occupations, to recover the state
of tranquillity, which his appearance had
somewhat interrupted.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, mean while, restless from disap∣pointment,
and impatient from anxiety,
having passed the greater part of the day in
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
enquiries, which repaid him only with doubt
and apprehension, determined to return to the
villa Altieri, when evening should conceal his
steps, consoled by the certainty of being
near the object of his thoughts, and hop∣ing,
that chance might favour him once
more with a view, however transient, of
Ellena.</P>
<P>The Marchesa Vivaldi held an assembly
this evening, and a suspicion concerning the
impatience he betrayed, induced her to de∣tain
him about her person to a late hour,
engaging him to select the music for her
orchestra, and to superintend the perform∣ance
of a new piece, the work of a com∣poser
whom she had brought into fashion.
Her assemblies were among the most bril∣liant
and crowded in Naples, and the nobi∣lity,
who were to be at the palace this even∣ing,
were divided into two parties as to the
merits of the musical genius, whom she pa∣tronized,
and those of another candidate
for fame. The performance of the evening
it was expected, would finally decide the
<PB N="15" REF="26"/>
victory. This, therefore, was a night of
great importance and anxiety to the Mar∣chesa,
for she was as jealous of the reputa∣tion
of her favourite composer as of her
own, and the welfare of her son did but
slightly divide her cares.</P>
<P>The moment he could depart unobserved,
he quitted the assembly, and, muffling him∣self
in his cloak, hastened to the villa Al∣tieri,
which lay at a short distance to the
west of the city. He reached it unobserved,
and, breathless with, impatience, traversed
the boundary of the garden; where, free
from ceremonial restraint, and near the ob∣ject
of his affection, he experienced for the
few first moments a joy as exquisite as her
presence could have inspired. But this de∣light
faded with its novelty, and in a short
time he felt as forlorn as if he was separated
for ever from Ellena, in whose presence he
but lately almost believed himself.</P>
<P>The night was far advanced, and, no light
appearing from the house, he concluded the
inhabitants had retired to rest, and all hope
<PB N="16" REF="27"/>
of seeing her vanished from his mind. Still,
however, it was sweet to be near her, and
he anxiously sought to gain admittance to
the gardens, that he might approach the
window where it was possible she reposed.
The boundary, formed of trees and thick
shrubs, was not difficult to be passed, and
he found himself once more in the portico of the villa.</P>
<P>It was nearly midnight, and the stillness
that reigned was rather soothed than in∣terrupted
by the gentle dashing of the wa∣ters
of the bay below, and by the hollow
murmurs of Vesuvius, which threw up, at
intervals its sudden flame on the horizon,
and then left it to darkness. The solem∣nity
of the scene accorded with the temper
of his mind, and he listened in deep atten∣tion
for the returning sounds, which broke
upon the ear like distant thunder muttering
imperfectly from the clouds. The pauses
of silence, that succeeded each groan of the
mountain, when expectation listened for the
rising sound, affected the imagination of
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>
Vivaldi at this time with particular awe,
and, rapt in thought, he continued to gaze
upon the sublime and shadowy outline of the
shores, and on the sea, just discerned be∣neath
the twilight of a cloudless sky. Along
its grey surface many vessels were pursuing
their silent course, guided over the deep
waters only by the polar star, which burned
with steady lustre. The air was calm, and
rose from the bay with most balmy and re∣freshing
coolness; it scarcely stirred the
heads of the broad pines that overspread
the villa; and bore no sounds but of the
waves and the groans of the far-off moun∣tain,—till
a chaunting of deep voices,
swelled from a distance. The solemn cha∣racter
of the strain engaged his attention;
he perceived that it was a requiem, and he
endeavoured to discover from what quarter
it came. It advanced, though distantly, and
then passed away on the air. The circum∣stance
struck him; he knew it was usual in
some parts of Italy to chaunt this strain over
the bed of the dying; but here the mourn∣ers
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
seemed to walk the earth, or the air.
He was not doubtful as to the strain itself;—once
before he had heard it, and attend∣ed
with circumstances which made it im∣possible
that he should ever forget it. As
he now listened to the choral voices soften∣ing
in distance, a few pathetic notes brought
full upon his remembrance the divine me∣lody
he had heard Ellena utter in the church
of San Lorenzo. Overcome by the recollec∣tion,
he started away, and, wandering over
the garden, reached another side of the
villa, where he soon heard the voice of El∣lena
herself, performing the midnight hymn
to the Virgin, and accompanied by a lute,
which she touched with most affecting and
delicate expression. He stood for a moment
entranced, and scarcely daring to breathe,
lest he should lose any note of that meek
and holy strain, which seemed to flow from
a devotion almost saintly. Then, looking
round to discover the object of his admira∣tion,
a light issuing from among the bowery
foliage of a clematis led him to a lattice, and
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
shewed him Ellena. The lattice had been
thrown open to admit the cool air, and he
had a full view of her and the apartment.
She was rising from a small altar where she
had concluded the service; the glow of
devotion was still upon her countenance as
she raised her eyes, and with a rapt ear∣nestness
fixed them on the heavens. She
still held the lute, but no longer awakened
it, and seemed lost to every surrounding ob∣ject.
Her fine hair was negligently bound
up in a silk net, and some tresses that had
escaped it, played on her neck, and round
her beautiful countenance, which now was
not even partially concealed by a veil. The
light drapery of her dress, her whole figure,
air, and attitude, were such as might have
been copied for a Grecian nymph.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was perplexed and agitated be∣tween
the wish of seizing an opportunity,
which might never again occur, of pleading
his love, and the fear of offending, by in∣truding
upon her retirement, at so sacred an
hour; but, while he thus hesitated, he
<PB N="20" REF="31"/>
heard her sigh, and then with a sweetness
peculiar to her accent, pronounce his name.
During the trembling anxiety, with which
he listened to what might follow this men∣tion
of his name, he disturbed the clematis
that surrounded the lattice, and she turned
her eyes towards the window; but Vivaldi
was entirely concealed by the foliage. She,
however, rose to close the lattice; as she
approached which, Vivaldi, unable any
longer to command himself, appeared before
her. She stood fixed for an instant, while
her countenance changed to an ashy pale∣ness;
and then, with trembling haste clos∣ing
the lattice, quitted the apartment. Vi∣valid
felt as if all his hopes had vanished
with her.</P>
<P>After lingering in the garden for some
time without perceiving a light in any other
part of the building, or hearing a sound pro∣ceed
from it, he took his melancholy way to
Naples. He now began to ask himself
some questions, which he ought to have
urged before, and to enquire wherefore he
<PB N="21" REF="32"/>
sought the dangerous pleasure of seeing
Ellena, since her family was of such a con∣dition
as rendered the consent of his parents
to a marriage with her unattainable.</P>
<P>He was lost in revery on this, subject,
sometimes half resolved to seek her no
more, and then shrinking from a conduct,
which seemed to strike him with the, force,
of despair, when, as he emerged from the
dark arch of a ruin, that extended over the
road, his steps were crossed by a person in the
habit of a monk, whose face was shrouded
by his cowl still more than by the twilight.
The stranger, addressing him by his name,
said, “Signor! your steps are watched;
beware how you revisit Altieri!” Having
uttered this, he disappeared, before Vivaldi
could return the sword he had half drawn
into the scabbard, or demand an explana∣tion
of the words he had heard. He called
loudly and repeatedly, conjuring the un∣known
person to appear, and lingered near
the spot for a considerable time; but the vi∣sion
came no more.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="33"/>
Vivaldi arrived at home with a mind oc∣cupied
by this incident, and tormented by
the jealousy to which it gave rise; for, af∣ter
indulging various conjectures, he con∣cluded
with believing the notice, of which
he had been warned, to be that of a rival,
and that the danger which menaced him,
was from the poniard of jealousy. This be∣lief
discovered to him at once the extent of
his passion, and of the imprudence, which
had thus readily admitted it; yet so far was
this new prudence from overcoming his er∣ror,
that, stung with a torture, more exqui∣site
than he had ever known, he resolved,
at every event, to declare his love, and sue
for the hand of Ellena. Unhappy young
man, he knew not the fatal error, into
which passion was precipitating him!</P>
<P>On his arrival at the Vivaldi palace, he
learned, that the Marchesa had observed his
absence, had repeatedly enquired for him,
and had given orders that the time of his
return should be mentioned to her. She
had, however, retired to rest; but the Mar∣chese,
<PB N="23" REF="34"/>
who had attended the King on an
excursion to one of the royal villas on the
bay, returned home soon after Vincentio;
and, before he had withdrawn to his apart∣ment,
he met his son with looks of unusual
displeasure, but avoided saying any thing,
which either explained or alluded to the sub∣ject
of it; and, after a short conversation,
they separated.</P>
<P>Vivaldi shut himself in his apartment to
deliberate, if that may deserve the name of
deliberation, in which a conflict of passions,
rather than an exertion of judgment, pre∣vailed.
For several hours he traversed his
suit of rooms, alternately tortured by the
remembrance of Ellena, fired with jealousy,
and alarmed for the consequence of the
imprudent step, which he was about to take.
He knew the temper of his father, and some
traits of the character of his mother, suffi∣ciently
to fear that, their displeasure would
be irreconcilable concerning the marriage
he meditated; yet, when he considered that
he was their only son, he was inclined, to
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
admit a hope of forgiveness, notwithstand∣ing
the weight which the circumstance must
add to their disappointment. These re∣flexions
were frequently interrupted by fears.
lest Ellena had already disposed of her af∣fections
to this imaginary rival. He was,
however, somewhat consoled by remember∣ing
the sigh she had uttered, and the ten∣derness,
with which she had immediately
pronounced his name. Yet, even if she were
not averse to his suit, how could, he solicit
her hand, and hope it would be given him,
when he should declare that this must be in
secret? He scarcely dared to believe that
she would condescend to enter a family
who disdained to receive her; and again
despondency overcame him.</P>
<P>The morning found him as distracted as
the night had left him; his determination,
however, was fixed; and this was, to sa∣crifice
what he now considered as a delusive
pride of birth, to a choice which he be∣lieved
would ensure the happiness of his life
<PB N="25" REF="36"/>
But, before he ventured to declare himself
to Ellena, it appeared necessary to ascertain
whether he held an interest in her heart, or
whether she had devoted it to the rival of
his love, and who this rival really was. It
was so much easier to wish for such inform∣ation
than to obtain it, that, after forming
a thousand projects, either the delicacy of
his respect for Ellena, or his fear of of∣fending
her, or an apprehension of disco∣very
from his family before he had secured
an interest in her affections, constantly op∣posed
his views of an enquiry.</P>
<P>In this difficulty he opened his heart to a
friend, who had long possessed his confi∣dence,
and whose advice he solicited with
somewhat more anxiety and sincerity than
is usual on such occasions. It was not a
sanction of his own opinion that he re∣quired,
but the impartial judgment of ano∣ther
mind. Bonarmo, however little he
might be qualified for the office of an ad∣viser,
did not scruple to give his advice. As
a means of judging whether Ellena was dis∣posed
<PB N="26" REF="37"/>
to favour Vivaldi's addresses, he
proposed that, according to the custom of
the country, a serenade should be given;
he maintained, that, if she was not disin∣clined
towards him, some sign of approba∣tion
would appear; and if otherwise, that
she would remain silent and invisible. Vi∣valid
objected to this coarse and inadequate
mode of expressing a love so sacred as his,
and he had too lofty an opinion of Ellena's
mind and delicacy, to believe, that the tri∣fling
homage of a serenade would either
flatter her self-love, or interest her in his
favour; nor, if it did, could he venture to
believe, that she would display any sign of
approbation.</P>
<P>His friend laughed at his scruples and at
his opinion of what he called such romantic
delicacy, that his ignorance of the world
was his only excuse for having cherished
them. But Vivaldi interrupted this rail∣lery,
and would neither suffer him for a
moment to speak thus of Ellena, or to call
such delicacy romantic. Bonarmo, how∣ever,
<PB N="27" REF="38"/>
still urged the serenade as at least a
possible means of discovering her disposi∣tion
towards him before he made a formal
avowal of his suit; and Vivaldi, perplexed
and distracted with apprehension and impa∣tience
to terminate his present state of sus∣pense,
was at length so far overcome by
his own difficulties, rather than by his
friend's persuasion, that he consented to
make the adventure of a serenade on the
approaching night. This was adopted ra∣ther
as a refuge from despondency, than with
any hope of success; for he still believed
that Ellena would not give any hint, that
might terminate his uncertainty.</P>
<P>Beneath their cloaks they carried musical
instruments, and, muffling up their faces,
so that they could not be known, they
proceeded, in thoughtful silence on the way
to the villa Altieri. Already they had passed
the arch, in which Vivaldi was stopped by
the stranger on the preceding night, when
he heard a sudden sound near him, and,
raising his head from the cloak, he per∣ceived
<PB N="28" REF="39"/>
the same figure! Before he had
time for exclamation, the stranger crossed
him again. “Go not to the villa Altieri,”
said he in a solemn voice, “lest you meet
the fate you ought to dread.”</P>
<P>“What fate?” demanded Vivaldi, step∣ping
back; “Speak, I conjure you!”.</P>
<P>But the monk was gone, and the dark∣ness
of the hour baffled observation as to
the way of his departure.</P>
<P><HI>“Dio mi guardi!”</HI> exclaimed Bonarmo,
this is almost beyond belief! but let us
return to Naples; this second warning
ought to be obeyed.”</P>
<P>“It is almost beyond endurance,” ex∣claimed
Vivaldi; “which way did he
pass?”</P>
<P>“He glided by me,” replied Bonarmo,
and he was gone before I could cross
him!”</P>
<P>“I will tempt the worst at once,” said
Vivaldi; “if I have a rival, it is best to
meet him. Let us go on.”</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="40"/>
Bonarmo remonstrated, and represented
the serious danger that threatened from so
rash a proceeding. “It is evident that
you have a rival,” said he; “and your
courage cannot avail you against hired
bravos.” Vivaldi's heart swelled at the
mention of a rival. “If you think it
dangerous to proceed, I will go alone,”
said he.</P>
<P>Hurt by this reproof, Bonarmo accom∣panied
his friend in silence, and they
reached without interruption the boundary
of the villa. Vivaldi led to the place by
which he had entered on the preceding
night, and they passed unmolested into the
garden.</P>
<P>“Where are these terrible bravos of
whom you warned me?” said Vivaldi, with
taunting exultation.</P>
<P>“Speak cautiously,” replied his friend;
we may, even now, be within their
reach.”</P>
<P>“They also may be within ours,” ob∣served
Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="41"/>
At length, these adventurous friends came
to the orangery, which was near the house,
when, tired by the ascent, they rested to re∣cover
breath, and to prepare their instru∣ments
for the serenade. The night was
still, and they now heard, for the first time,
murmurs as of a distant multitude; and
then the sudden splendor of fireworks broke
upon the sky. These arose from a villa on
the western margin of the bay, and were
given in honour of the birth of one of the
royal princes. They soared to an immense
height, and, as their lustre broke silently
upon the night, it lightened on the thou∣sand
up-turned faces of the gazing crowd,
illumined the waters of the bay, with every
little boat that skimmed its surface, and
shewed distinctly the whole sweep of its
rising shores, the stately city of Naples on
the strand below, and, spreading far among
the hills, its terraced roofs crowded with
spectators, and the Corso tumultuous with
carriages and blazing with torches.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="42"/>
While Bonarmo surveyed this magnifi∣cent
scene, Vivaldi turned his eyes to the
residence of Ellena, part of which looked
out from among the trees, with a hope that
the spectacle would draw her to a balcony;
but she did not appear, nor was there any
light, that might indicate her approach.</P>
<P>While they still rested on the turf of the
orangery, they heard a, sudden rustling of
the leaves, as if the branches were disturbed
by some person who endeavoured to make
his way between them, when Vivaldi de∣manded
who passed. No answer was re∣turned,
and a long silence followed.</P>
<P>“We are observed,” said Bonarmo, at
length, “and are even now, perhaps, al∣most
beneath the poinard of the assassin:
let us be gone.”</P>
<P>“O that my heart were as secure from
the darts of love, the assassin of my peace,”
exclaimed Vivaldi, “as yours is from those
of bravos! My friend, you have little to
interest you, since your thoughts have so
much leisure for apprehension.”</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="43"/>
“My fear is that of prudence, not of
weakness,” retorted Bonarmo, with acri∣mony;
“you will find, perhaps, that I
have none, when you most wish me to pos∣sess it.”</P>
<P>“I understand you,” replied Vivaldi;
“let us finish this business, and you shall
receive reparation, since you believe your∣self
injured: I am as anxious to repair an
offence, as jealous of receiving one.”</P>
<P>“Yes,” replied Bonarmo, “you would
repair the injury you have done your friend
with, his blood.”</P>
<P>“Oh! never, never!” said Vivaldi, fall∣ing
on his neck. “Forgive my hasty” vio∣lence;
allow for the distraction of my
mind.”</P>
<P>Bonarmo returned the embrace. “It is
enough,” said he; “no more, no more!
I hold again my friend to my heart.”</P>
<P>While this conversation passed, they had
quitted the orangery, and reached the walls
of the villa, where they took their station
under a balcony that overhung the lattice,
<PB N="33" REF="44"/>
through which Vivaldi had seen Ellena on
the preceding night. They tuned their in∣struments,
and opened the serenade with a
duet.</P>
<P>Vivaldi's voice was a fine tenor, and the
same susceptibility, which made him passion∣ately
fond of music, taught him to modu∣late
its cadence with exquisite delicacy, and
to give his emphasis with the most simple
and pathetic expression. His soul seemed to
breathe in the sounds,—so tender, so im∣ploring,
yet so energetic. On this night, en∣thusiasm
inspired him with the highest elo∣quence,
perhaps, which music is capable
of attaining; what might be its effect on
Ellena he had no means of judging, for she
did not appear either at the balcony or the
lattice, nor gave any hint of applause. No
sounds stole on the stillness of the night,
except those of the serenade, nor did any
light from within the villa break upon the
obscurity without; once, indeed, in a pause
of the instruments, Bonarmo fancied he
distinguished voices near him, as of persons
<PB N="34" REF="45"/>
who feared to be heard, and he listened at∣tentively,
but without ascertaining the truth.
Sometimes they seemed to sound heavily in
his ear, and then a death-like silence pre∣vailed.
Vivaldi affirmed the sound to be
nothing more than the confused murmur
of the distant multitude on the shore, but
Bonarmo was not thus easily convinced.</P>
<P>The musicians, unsuccessful in their first
endeavour to attract attention, removed to
the opposite side of the building, and plac∣ed
themselves in front of the portico, but
with as little success; and, after having ex∣ercised
their powers of harmony and of pa∣tience
for above an hour, they resigned all
further effort to win upon the obdurate
Ellena. Vivaldi, notwithstanding the feeble∣ness
of his first hope of seeing her, now
suffered an agony of disappointment; and
Bonarmo, alarmed for the consequence of
his despair, was as anxious to persuade him
that he had no rival, as he had lately been
pertinacious in affirming that he had one.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="46"/>
At length, they left the gardens, Vivaldi
protesting that he would not rest till he
had discovered the stranger, who so wan∣tonly
destroyed his peace, and had com∣pelled
him to explain his ambiguous war∣nings;
and Bonarmo remonstrating on the
imprudence and difficulty of the search,
and representing that such conduct would
probably be the means of spreading a re∣port
of his attachment, where most he dread∣ed
it should be known.</P>
<P>Vivaldi refused to yield to remonstrance
or considerations of any kind. “We shall
see,” said he, “whether this demon in the
garb of a monk, will haunt me again at the
accustomed place; if he does, he shall not
escape my grasp; and if he does not, I will
watch as vigilantly for his return, as he
seems to have done for mine. I will lurk
in the shade of the ruin, and wait for him,
though it be till death!”</P>
<P>Bonarmo was particularly struck by the
vehemence with which he pronounced the
last words, but he no longer opposed his
<PB N="36" REF="47"/>
purpose, and only bade him consider whe∣ther
he was well armed, “For,” he added,
“you may have need of arms there, though
you had no use for them at the villa Altieri.
Remember that the stranger told you that
your steps were watched.”</P>
<P>“I have my sword,” replied Vivaldi,
“and the dagger which I usually wear; but
I ought to enquire what are your weapons
of defence.”</P>
<P>“Hush!” said Bonarmo, as they turned
the foot of a rock that overhung the road,
“we are approaching the spot; yonder is
the arch!” It appeared duskily in the per∣spective,
suspended between two cliffs, where
the road wound from sight, on one of which
were the ruins of the Roman fort it belonged
to, and on the other, shadowing pines, and
thickets of oak that tufted the rock to its base.</P>
<P>They proceeded in silence, treading light∣ly,
and often throwing a suspicious glance
around, expecting every instant that the
monk would steal out upon them from
some recess of the cliffs. But they passed
<PB N="37" REF="48"/>
on unmolested to the arch-way. “We are
here before him, however,” said Vivaldi as
they entered the darkness. “Speak low,
my friend,” said Bonarmo, “others besides
ourselves may be shrouded in this obscurity.
I like not the place.”</P>
<P>“Who but ourselves would chuse so dis∣mal
a retreat?” whispered Vivaldi, “unless
indeed, it were banditti; the savageness of
the spot would, in truth, suit their humour,
and it suits well also with my own.”</P>
<P>“It would suit their purpose too, as
well as their humour,” observed Bonarmo.
“Let us remove from this deep shade, into
the more open road, where we can as close∣ly
observe who passes.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi objected that in the road they
might themselves be observed, “and if we
are seen by my unknown tormentor, our
design is defeated, for he comes upon us
suddenly, or not at all, lest we should be
prepared to detain him.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, as he said this, took his station
within the thickest gloom of the arch, which
<PB N="38" REF="49"/>
was of considerable depth, and near a flight
of steps that was cut in the rock, and as∣cended
to the fortress. His friend stepped
close to his side. After a pause of silence,
during which Bonarmo was meditating, and
Vivaldi was impatiently watching, “Do
you really believe,” said the former, “that
any effort to detain him would be effectual?
He glided past me with a strange facility,
it was surely more than human!”</P>
<P>“What is it you mean? enquired Vi∣valdi.</P>
<P>“Why, I mean that I could be super∣stitious.
This place, perhaps, infests my
mind with, congenial gloom, for I find that,
at this moment, there is scarcely a supersti∣tion
too dark for my credulity.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi smiled. “And you must; allow,”
added Bonarmo, “that he has appeared,
under circumstances somewhat extraordi∣nary.
How should he know your name,
by which, you say, he addressed you at the
first meeting? How should he know from
whence you came, or whether you designed
<PB N="39" REF="50"/>
to return? By what magic could he become
acquainted with your plans?”</P>
<P>“Nor am I certain that he is acquainted
with them,” observed Vivaldi; “but if he
is, there was no necessity for superhuman
means to obtain such knowledge.”</P>
<P>“The result of this evening surely ought
to convince you that he is acquainted with
your designs,” said Bonarmo. “Do you
believe it possible that Ellena could have
been insensible to your attentions, if her
heart had not been pre-engaged, and that she
would not have shewn herself at a lattice?”</P>
<P>“You do not know Ellena,” replied Vi∣valdi,
“and therefore I once more pardon
you the question. Yet had she been dis∣posed
to accept my addresses, surely some;
sign of approbation,”—he checked him∣self.</P>
<P>“The stranger warned you not to go to
the villa Altieri,” resumed Bonarmo, “he
seemed to anticipate the reception, which
awaited you, and to know a danger, which
hitherto you have happily escaped.”</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="51"/>
“Yes, he anticipated too well that re∣ception,”
said Vivaldi, losing his prudence
in passionate exclamation; “and he is him∣self,
perhaps, the rival, whom he has taught
me to suspect. He has assumed a disguise
only the more effectually to impose upon
my credulity, and to deter me from addres∣sing
Ellena. And shall I tamely lie in wait
for his approach? Shall I lurk like a guilty
assassin for this rival?”</P>
<P>“For heaven's sake!” said Bonarmo,
“moderate these transports; consider where
you are. This furmise of yours is in the
highest degree improbable.” He gave his
reasons for thinking so, and these convinced
Vivaldi, who was prevailed upon to be once
more patient.</P>
<P>They had remained watchful and still for
a considerable time, when Bonarmo saw a
person approach the end of the arch-way
nearest to Altieri. He heard no step, but
he perceived a shadowy figure station itself
at the entrance of the arch, where the twi∣light
of this brilliant climate was, for a few
<PB N="41" REF="52"/>
paces, admitted. Vivaldi's eyes were fixed
on the road leading towards Naples, and he,
therefore, did not perceive the object of
Bonarmo's attention, who, fearful of his
friend's precipitancy, forbore to point out
immediately what he observed, judging it
more prudent to watch the motions of this
unknown person, that he might ascertain
whether it really were the monk. The size
of the figure, and the dark drapery in which
it seemed wrapt, induced him, at length, to
believe that this was the expected stranger;
and he seized Vivaldi's arm to direct his at∣tention
to him, when the form gliding for∣ward
disappeared in the gloom, but not
before Vivaldi had understood the occasion
of his friend's gesture and significant silence.
They heard no footstep pass them, and,
being convinced that this person, whatever
he was, had not left the arch-way, they kept
their station in watchful stillness. Presently
they heard a rustling, as of garments, near
them, and Vivaldi, unable longer to com∣mand
his patience, started from his conceal∣ment,
<PB N="42" REF="53"/>
and with arms extended to prevent
any one from escaping, demanded who was
there.</P>
<P>The sound ceased, and no reply was made.
Bonarmo drew his sword, protesting he
would stab the air till he found the person
who lurked there; but that if the latter
would discover himself, he should receive
no injury. This assurance Vivaldi confirm∣ed
by his promise. Still no answer was re∣turned;
but as they listened for a voice,
they thought something passed them, and
the avenue was not narrow enough to have
prevented such a circumstance. Vivaldi
rushed forward, but did not perceive any
person issue from the arch into the highway,
where the stronger twilight must have dis∣covered
him.</P>
<P>“Somebody certainly passed,” whispered
Bonarmo, “and I think I hear a sound from
yonder steps, that lead to the fortress.”</P>
<P>“Let us follow,” cried Vivaldi, and he
began to ascend.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="54"/>
“Stop, for heaven's sake stop!” said
Bonarmo; “consider what you are about!
Do not brave the utter darkness of these
ruins; do not pursue the assassin to his
den!”.</P>
<P>“It is the monk himself!” exclaimed
Vivaldi, still ascending; “he shall not escape
me!”</P>
<P>Bonarmo paused a moment at the foot of
the steps, and his friend disappeared; he
hesitated what to do, till ashamed of suffer∣ing
him to encounter danger alone, he
sprang to the flight, and not without diffi∣culty
surmounted the rugged steps.</P>
<P>Having reached the summit of the rock,
he found himself on a terrace, that ran along
the top of the arch-way, and had once been,
fortified; this, crossing the road, command∣ed
the desile each way. Some remains of
massy walls, that still exhibited loops for
archers, were all that now hinted of its
former use. It led to a watch-tower almost
concealed in thick pines, that crowned the
opposite cliff, and had thus served not only
<PB N="44" REF="55"/>
for a strong battery over the road, but, con∣necting
the opposite sides of the defile, had
formed a line of communication between the
fort and this out-post.</P>
<P>Bonarmo looked round in vain for his
friend, and the echoes of his own voice only,
among the rocks, replied to his repeated
calls. After some hesitation whether to
enter the walls of the main building, or to
cross to the watch-tower, he determined on
the former, and entered a rugged area, the
walls of which, following the declivities of
the precipice, could scarcely now be traced.
The citadel, a round tower, of majestic
strength, with some Roman arches scattered
near, was all that remained of this once im∣portant
fortress; except indeed, a mass of
ruins near the edge of the cliff, the con∣struction
of which made it difficult to guess
for what purpose it had been designed.</P>
<P>Bonarmo entered the immense walls of
the citadel, but the utter darkness within
checked his progress, and, contenting him∣self
with calling loudly on Vivaldi, he re∣turned
to the open air.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="56"/>
As he approached the mass of ruins, whose
singular form had interested his curiosity,
he thought he distinguished the low accents
of a human voice, and while he listened in
anxiety, a person rushed forth from a door∣way
of the ruin, carrying a drawn sword.
It was Vivaldi himself. Bonarmo sprang to
meet him; he was pale and breathless, and
some moments elapsed before he could
speak, or appeared to hear the repeated en∣quiries
of his friend.</P>
<P>“Let us go,” said Vivaldi, “let us leave
this place!”</P>
<P>“Most willingly,” replied Bonarmo,
“but where have you been, and who have
you seen, that you are thus affected.”</P>
<P>“Ask me no more questions, let us go,”
repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>They descended the rock together, and
when, having reached the arch-way, Bo∣narmo
enquired, half sportively, whether
they should remain any longer on the watch,
his friend answered, “No!” with an em∣phasis
that startled him. They passed hastily
<PB N="46" REF="57"/>
on the way to Naples, Bonarmo repeating
enquiries which Vivaldi seemed reluctant to
satisfy, and wondering no less at the cause of
this sudden reserve, than anxious to know
whom he had seen.</P>
<P>“It was the monk, then,” said Bonarmo;
“you secured him at last?”</P>
<P>“I know not what to think,” replied
Vivaldi, “I am more perplexed than ever.”</P>
<P>“He escaped you then?”</P>
<P>“We will speak of this in future,” said
Vivaldi; “but be it as it may, the business
rests not here. I will return in the night
of to-morrow with a torch; dare you ven∣ture
yourself with me?”</P>
<P>“I know not,” replied Bonarmo, “whe∣ther
I ought to do so, since I am not in∣formed
for what purpose.”</P>
<P>“I will not press you to go,” said Vi∣valdi;
“my purpose is already known to
you.”</P>
<P>“Have you really failed to discover the
stranger—have you still doubts concerning
the person you pursued?”</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="58"/>
“I have doubts, which to-morrow night,
I hope, will dissipate.”</P>
<P>“This is very strange!” said Bonarmo,
“It was but now that I witnessed the hor∣ror,
with which you left the fortress of
Paluzzi, and already you speak of returning
to it! And why at night—why not in the
day, when less danger would beset you?”</P>
<P>“I know not as to that,” replied Vivaldi,
“you are to observe that day-light never
pierces within the recess, to which I pene∣trated;
we must search the place with
torches at whatsoever hour we would ex∣amine
it.”</P>
<P>“Since this is necessary,” said Bonarmo,
“how happens it that you found your way
in total darkness?”.</P>
<P>“I was too much engaged to know how;
I was led on, as by an invisible hand.”</P>
<P>“We must, notwithstanding,” observed
Bonarmo, “go in day-time, if not by day∣light,
provided I accompany you. It would
be little less than insanity to go twice to a
place, which is probably infested with
<PB N="48" REF="59"/>
robbers, and at their own hour of mid∣night.”</P>
<P>“I shall watch again in the accustomed
place,” replied Vivaldi, “before I use my
last resource, and this cannot be done du∣ring
the day. Besides, it is necessary that I
should go at a particular hour, the hour
when the monk has usually appeared.”</P>
<P>“He did escape you, then?” said Bonar∣mo,
“and you are still ignorant concerning
who he is?”</P>
<P>Vivaldi rejoined only with an enquiry
whether his friend would accompany him.
“If not,” he added, “I must hope to find
another companion.”</P>
<P>Bonarmo said, that he must consider of
the proposal, and would acquaint him with
his determination before the following
evening.</P>
<P>While this conversation concluded, they
were in Naples, and at the gates of the
Vivaldi palace, where they separated for the
remainder of the night.</P>

<Q><L>OLIVIA. “Why what would you?”</L>

<BIBL>TWELFTH NIGHT.</BIBL></Q>
<P>SINCE Vivaldi had failed to procure an
explanation of the words of the monk, he
determined to relieve himself from the tor∣tures
of suspence, respecting a rival, by
going to the villa Altieri, and declaring his
pretensions. On the morning immediately
following his late adventure, he went thither,
and on enquiring for Signora Bianchi, was
told that she could not be seen. With
much difficulty he prevailed upon the old
<PB N="50" REF="61"/>
house-keeper to deliver a request that he
might be permitted to wait upon her for
a few moments. Permission was granted
him, when he was conducted into the very
apartment where he had formerly seen
Ellena. It was unoccupied and he was
told that Signora Bianchi would be there
presently.</P>
<P>During this interval, he was agitated at
one moment with quick impatience, and at
another with enthusiastic pleasure, while he
gazed on the altar whence he had seen
Ellena rise, and where, to his fancy, she
still appeared; and on every object, on
which he knew her eyes had lately dwelt.
These objects, so familiar to her, had in,
the imagination of Vivaldi acquired some∣what
of the sacred character she had im∣pressed
upon his heart, and affected him in
some degree as her presence would have
done. He trembled as he took up the lute
she had been accustomed to touch, and,
when he awakened the chords, her own
voice seemed to speak. A drawing, half
<PB N="51" REF="62"/>
finished, of a dancing nymph remained on
a stand, and he immediately understood that
her hand had traced the lines. It was a
copy from Herculaneum, and, though a
copy, was touched with the spirit of origi∣nal
genius. The light steps appeared al∣most
to move, and the whole figure dis∣played
the airy lightness of exquisite grace.
Vivaldi perceived this to be one of a set
that ornamented the apartment, and ob∣served
with surprise, that they were the
particular subjects, which adorned his fa∣ther's
cabinet, and which he had understood
to be the only copies permitted from the
originals in the royal museum.</P>
<P>Every object, on which his eyes rested,
seemed to announce the presence of Ellena;
and the very flowers that so gaily embellish∣ed
the apartment, breathed forth a perfume,
which fascinated his senses and affected his
imagination. Before Signora Bianchi ap∣peared,
his anxiety and apprehension had
encreased so much, that, believing he should
be unable to support himself in her pre∣fence
<PB N="52" REF="63"/>
he was more than once upon the
point of leaving the house. At length, he
heard her approaching step from the hall,
and his breath almost forsook him. The
figure of Signora Bianchi was not of an
order to inspire admiration, and a specta∣tor
might have smiled to see the perturba∣tion
of Vivaldi, his faultering step and
anxious eye, as he advanced to meet the
venerable Bianchi, as he bowed upon her
faded hand, and listened to her querulous
voice. She received him with an air of
reserve, and some moments passed before
he could recollect himself sufficiently to
explain the purpose of his visit; yet this,
when, he discovered it, did not apparently
surprise her. She listened with composure,
though with somewhat of a severe counte∣nance,
to his protestations of regard for her
niece, and when he implored her to inter∣cede
for him in obtaining the hand of
Ellena, she said, “I cannot be ignorant
that a family of your rank must be averse to
an union with one ofmine; nor am I unac∣quainted
<PB N="53" REF="64"/>
that a full sense of the value of
birth is a marking feature in the characters
of the Marchese and Marchesa di Vivaldi.
This proposal must be disagreeable or, at
least, unknown to them; and I am to in∣form
you, Signor, that, though Signora di
Rosalba is their inferior in rank, she is
their equal in pride.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi disdained to prevaricate, yet was
shocked to own the truth thus abruptly.
The ingenuous manner, however, with
which he at length did this, and the energy
of a passion too eloquent to be misunder∣stood,
somewhat soothed the anxiety of
Signora Bianchi, with whom other consi∣derations
began to arise. She considered
that from her own age and infirmities she
must very soon, in the course of nature,
leave Ellena a young and friendless orphan;
still somewhat dependent upon her own in∣dustry,
and entirely so on her discretion.
With much beauty and little knowledge of
the world, the dangers of her future situa∣tion
appeared in vivid colours to the affec∣tionate
<PB N="54" REF="65"/>
mind of Signora Bianchi; and she
sometimes thought that it might be right
to sacrifice considerations, which in other
circumstances would be laudable, to the
obtaining for her niece the protection of
a husband and a man of honour. If in
this instance she descended from the lofty
integrity, which ought to have opposed her
consent that Ellena should clandestinely
enter any family, her parental anxiety may
soften the censure she deserved.</P>
<P>But, before she determined upon this
subject, it was necessary to ascertain that
Vivaldi was worthy of the considence she
might repose in him. To try, also, the
constancy of his affection, she gave little
present encouragement to his hopes. His
request to see Ellena she absolutely refused,
till she should have considered further of
his proposals; and his enquiry whether he
had a rival, and, if he had, whether Ellena
was disposed to favour him, she evaded,
since she knew that a reply would give
<PB N="55" REF="66"/>
more encouragement to his hopes, than it
might hereafter be proper to confirm.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, at length, took his leave, re∣leased,
indeed, from absolute despair, but
scarcely encouraged to hope; ignorant that
he had a rival, yet doubtful whether Ellena
honoured himself with any share of her
esteem.</P>
<P>He had received permission to wait upon
Signora Bianchi on a future day, but till
that day should arrive time appeared mo∣tionless;
and, since it seemed utterly im∣possible
to endure this interval of suspence,
his thoughts on the way to Naples were
wholy engaged in contriving the means of
concluding it, till he reached the well∣known
arch, and looked round, though
hopelessly, for his mysterious tormentor.
The stranger did not appear; and Vivaldi
pursued the road, determined to re-visit the
spot at night, and also to return privately
to villa Altieri, where he hoped a second
visit might procure for him some relief
from his present anxiety.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="67"/>
When he reached home he found that
the Marchese, his father, had left an order
for him to await his arrival; which he
obeyed; but the day passed without his
return. The Marchesa, when she saw him,
enquired, with a look that expressed much,
how he had engaged himself of late, and
completely frustrated his plans for the
evening, by requiring him to attend her
to Portici. Thus he was prevented from
receiving Bonarmo's determination, from
watching at Paluzzi, and from revisiting
Ellena's residence.</P>
<P>He remained at Portici the following
evening, and, on his return to Naples, the
Marchese being again absent, he continued
ignorant of the intended subject of the in∣terview.
A note from Bonarmo brought
a refusal to accompany him to the fortress,
and urged him to forbear so dangerous a
visit. Being for this night unprovided with
a companion for the adventure, and un∣willing
to go alone, Vivaldi deferred it to
another evening; but no consideration
<PB N="57" REF="68"/>
could deter him from visiting the villa Altieri.
Not chusing to solicit his friend to accom∣pany
him thither, since he had refused his
first request, he took his solitary lute, and
reached the garden at an earlier hour than
usual.</P>
<P>The sun had been set above an hour, but
the horizon still retained somewhat of a saf∣fron
brilliancy, and the whole dome of the
sky had an appearance of transparency, pe∣culiar
to this enchanting climate, which
seemed to diffuse a more soothing twilight
over the reposing world. In the south-east
the outline of Vesuvius appeared distinctly,
but the mountain itself was dark and silent.</P>
<P>Vivaldi heard only the quick and eager
voices of some Lazaroni at a distance on the
shore, as they contended at the simple game
of maro. From the bowery lattices of a
small pavilion within the orangery, he per∣ceived
a light, and the sudden hope, which
it occasioned, of seeing Ellena, almost over∣came
him. It was impossible to resist the
opportunity of beholding her, yet he check∣ed
<PB N="58" REF="69"/>
the impatient step he was taking, to ask
himself, whether it was honorable thus to
steal upon her retirement, and become an
unsuspected observer of her secret thoughts.
But the temptation was too powerful for
this honorable hesitation; the pause was
momentary; and, stepping lightly towards
the pavilion, he placed himself near an open
lattice, so as to be shrouded from observa∣tion
by the branches of an orange-tree,
while he obtained a full view of the apart∣ment.
Ellena was alone, sitting in a
thoughtful attitude and holding her lute,
which she did not play. She appeared lost
to a consciousness of surrounding objects,
and a tenderness was on her-countenance,
which seemed to tell him that her thoughts
were engaged by some interesting subject.
Recollecting that, when last he had seen her
thus, she pronounced his name, his hope
revived, and he was going to discover him∣self
and appear at her feet, when she spoke,
and he paused.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="70"/>
“Why this unreasonable pride of birth!”
said she; “A visionary prejudice destroys
our peace. Never would I submit to enter
a family averse to receive me, they shall
learn, at least, that I inherit nobility of soul.
O! Vivaldi! but for this unhappy preju∣dice!”—</P>
<P>Vivaldi, while he listened to this, was im∣movable;
he seemed as if entranced; the
sound of her lute and voice recalled him,
and he heard her sing the first stanza of the
very air, with which he had opened the se∣renade
on a former night, and with such
sweet pathos as the composer must have felt
when he was inspired with the idea.</P>
<P>She paused at the conclusion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst
stanza, when Vivaldi, overcome by the
temptation of such an opportunity for ex∣pressing
his passion, suddenly struck the
chords of the lute, and replied to her in the
second. The tremor of his voice, though
it restrained his tones, heightened its elo∣quence.
Ellena instantly recollected it;
her colour alternately faded and returned;
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>
and, before the verse concluded, she seemed
to have lost all consciousness. Vivaldi was
now advancing into the pavilion, when his
approach recalled her; she waved him to
retire, and before he could spring to her sup∣port,
she rose and would have left the place,
had he not interrupted her and implored a
few moments attention.</P>
<P>“It is impossible,” said Ellena.</P>
<P>“Let me only hear you say that I am not
hateful to you,” rejoined Vivaldi; “that
this intrusion has not deprived me of the
regard, with which but now you acknow∣ledged
you honoured me.”—</P>
<P>“Oh, never, never!” interrupted Ellena,
impatiently; “forget that I ever made such
acknowledgment; forget that you ever
heard it; I know not what I said.”</P>
<P>“Ah, beautiful Ellena! do you think it
possible I ever can forget it? It will be the
solace of my solitary hours, the hope that
shall sustain me.”—</P>
<P>“I cannot be detained Signor,” inter∣rupted
Ellena, still more embarrassed, “or
<PB N="61" REF="72"/>
forgive myself for having permitted such a
conversation;” but as she spoke the last
words, an involuntary smile seemed to con∣tradict
their meaning. Vivaldi believed the
smile in spite of the words; but, before he
could express the lightning joy of convic∣tion,
she had left the pavilion; he followed
through the garden—but she was gone.</P>
<P>From this moment Vivaldi seemed to have
arisen into a new existenee; the whole world
to him was Paradise; that smile seemed im∣pressed
upon his heart for ever. In the
fulnefs of present joy, he believed it impos∣sible
that he could ever be unhappy again,
and defied the utmost malice of future for∣tune.
With footsteps light as air, he re∣turned
to Naples, nor once remembered to
look for his old monitor on the way.</P>
<P>The Marchese and his mother being from
home, he was left at his leisure to indulge
the rapturous recollection, that pressed
upon his mind, and of which he was impa∣tient
of a moment's interruption. All night
he either traversed his apartment with an
<PB N="62" REF="73"/>
agitation equal to that, which anxiety had so
lately inflicted, or composed and destroyed
letters to Ellena; sometimes fearing that
he had written too much, and at others
feeling that he had written too little; re∣collecting
circumstances which he ought to
have mentioned, and lamenting the cold
expression of a passion, to which it appeared
that no language could do justice.</P>
<P>By the hour when the domestics had
risen, he had, however, completed a letter
somewhat more to his satisfaction, and he
dispatched it to the villa Altieri by a con∣fidential
person; but the servant had
scarcely quitted the gates, when he recol∣lected
new arguments, which he wished to
urge, and expressons to change of the ut∣most
importance to enforce his meaning,
and he would have given half the world to
have recalled the messenger.</P>
<P>In this state of agitation he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummon∣ed
to attend the Marchese, who had been
too much engaged of late to keep his own
appointment. Vivaldi was not long in
<PB N="63" REF="74"/>
doubt as to the subject of this inter∣view.</P>
<P>“I have wished to speak with you,” said
the Marchese, assuming an air of haughty
severity, “upon a subject of the utmost
importance to your honour and happiness;
and I wished, also, to give you an opportu∣nity
of contradicting a report, which would
have occasioned me considerable uneasiness,
if I could have believed it. Happily I had
too much confidence in my son to credit
this; and I affirmed that he understood too
well what was due both to his family and
himself, to take any step derogatory from
the dignity of either. My motive for this
conversation, therefore, is merely to afford
you a moment for refuting the calumny I
shall mention, and to obtain for myself au∣thority
for contradicting it to the persons
who have communicated it to me.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi waited impatiently for the con∣clusion
of this exordium, and then begged
to be informed of the subject of the re∣port.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="75"/>
“It is said,” resumed the Marchese,
that there is a young woman, who is
called Ellena Rosalba,—I think that is the
name;—do you know any person of the
name?”</P>
<P>“Do I know!” exclaimed Vivaldi, “but
pardon me, pray proceed, my Lord.”</P>
<P>The Marchese paused, and regarded his
son with sternness, but without surprize.
“It is said, that a young person of this
name has contrived to fascinate your affec∣tions,
and”—</P>
<P>“It is most true, my Lord, that Signora
Rosalba has won my affections,” interrupt∣ed
Vivaldi with honest impatience, “but
without contrivance.”</P>
<P>“I will not be interrupted,” said the
Marchese, interrupting in his turn. “It is
said that me has so artfully adapted her
temper to yours, that, with the assistance of
a relation who lives with her, she has re∣duced
you to the degrading situation of her
devoted suitor.”</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="76"/>
“Signora Rosalba has, my Lord, ex∣alted
me to the honour of being her suitor,”
said Vivaldi, unable longer to command his
feelings. He was proceeding, when the
Marchese abruptly checked him, “You
avow your folly then!”</P>
<P>“My Lord, I glory in my choice.”</P>
<P>“Young man,” rejoined his father, “as
this is the arrogance and romantic enthu∣siasm
of a boy, I am willing to forgive it for
once, and observe me, only for once. If
you will acknowledge your error, instantly
dismiss this new favourite.”—</P>
<P>“My Lord!”</P>
<P>“You must instantly dismiss. her,” re∣peated
the Marchese with sterner emphasis;
“and, to prove that I am more merciful
than just, I am willing, on this condition,
to allow her a small annuity as some repa∣ration
for the depravity, into which you
have assisted to sink her.”</P>
<P>“My Lord!” exclaimed Vivaldi aghast,
and scarcely daring to trust his voice, “my
Lord!—depravity?” struggling for breath.
<PB N="66" REF="77"/>
“Who has dared to pollute her spotless
fame by insulting your ears with such in∣famous
falsehood? Tell me, I conjure you,
instantly tell me, that I may hasten to give
him his reward. Depravity!—an annuity—an
annuity! O Ellena! Ellena!” As he
pronounced her name tears of tenderness
mingled with those of indignation.</P>
<P>“Young man,” said the Marchese, who
had observed the violence of his emotion
with strong displeasure and alarm, “I do
not lightly give faith to report, and I can∣not
suffer myself to doubt the truth of what
I have advanced. You are deceived, and
your vanity will continue the delusion, un∣less
I condescend to exert my authority,
and tear the veil from your eyes. Dismiss
her instantly, and I will adduce proof of her
former character which will stagger even
your faith, enthusiastic as it is.”</P>
<P>“Dismiss her!” repeated; Vivaldi, with
calm yet stern energy, such as his father
had never seen him assume; “My Lord,
you have never yet doubted my word, and
<PB N="67" REF="78"/>
I now pledge you that honourable word,
that Ellena is innocent. Innocent! O hea∣vens,
that it should ever be necessary to af∣firm
so, and, above all, that it should ever
be necessary for me to vindicate her!”</P>
<P>“I must indeed lament that it ever
should,” replied the Marchese coldly.
“You have pledged your word, which I
cannot question. I believe, therefore, that
you are deceived; that you think her vir∣tuous,
notwithstanding your midnight visits
to her house. And grant she is, unhappy
boy! what reparation can you make her
for the infatuated folly, which has thus
stained her character? What”—</P>
<P>“By proclaiming to the world, my Lord,
that she is worthy of becoming my wife,”
replied Vivaldi, with a glow of countenance,
which announced the courage and the ex∣ultation
of a virtuous mind.</P>
<P>“Your wife!” said the Marchese, with
a look of ineffable disdain, which was in∣stantly
succeeded by one of angry alarm.—“If
I believed you could so far forget what
<PB N="68" REF="79"/>
is due to the honour of your house, I would
for ever disclaim you as my son.”</P>
<P>“O! why,” exclaimed Vivaldi, in an
agony of conflicting passions, “why should
I be in danger of forgetting what is due to
a father, when I am only asserting what is
due to innocence; when I am only defend∣ing
her, who has no other to defend her!
Why may not I be permitted to reconcile
duties so congenial! But, be the event what
it may, I will defend the oppressed, and
glory in the virtue, which teaches me, that
it is the first duty of humanity to do so.
Yes, my Lord, if it must be so, I am ready
to sacrifice inferior duties to the grandeur of
a principle, which ought to expand all hearts
and impel all actions. I shall best support
the honour of my house by adhering to its
dictates.”</P>
<P>“Where is the principle,” said the Mar∣chese,
impatiently, “which shall teach you
to disobey a father; where is the virtue
which shall instruct you to degrade your
family?”</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="80"/>
“There can be no degradation, my
Lord, where there is no vice,” replied Vi∣valid;
“and there are instances, pardon me,
my Lord, there are some few instances in
which it is virtuous to disobey.”</P>
<P>“This paradoxical morality,” said the
Marchese, with passionate displeasure, “and
this romantic language, sufficiently explain
to me the character of your associates, and
the innocence of her, whom you defend
with so chivalric an air. Are you to learn,
Signor, that you belong to your family, not
your family to you; that you are only a
guardian of its honour, and not at liberty
to dispose of yourself? My patience will en∣dure
no more!”</P>
<P>Nor could the patience of Vivaldi endure
this repeated attack on the honor of Ellena.
But, while he yet asserted her innocence,
he endeavoured to do so with the temper,
which was due to the presence of a father;
and, though he maintained the indepen∣dence
of a man, he was equally anxious to
preserve inviolate the duties of a son. But
<PB N="70" REF="81"/>
unfortunately the Marchese and Vivaldi dif∣fered
in opinion concerning the limits of
these duties; the first extending them to
passive obedience, and the latter conceiving
them to conclude at a point, wherein the
happiness of an individual is so deeply con∣cerned
as in marriage. They parted mutually
inflamed; Vivaldi unable to prevail
with his father to mention the name of his
infamous informant, or to acknowledge
himself convinced of Ellena's innocence;
and the Marchese equally unsuccessful in
his endeavours to obtain from his son a pro∣mise
that he would see her no more.</P>
<P>Here then was Vivaldi, who only a few
short hours before had experienced a happi∣ness
so supreme as to efface all impressions
of the past, and to annihilate every consi∣deration
of the future; a joy so full that it
permitted him not to believe it possible that
he could ever again taste of misery; he,
who had felt as if that moment was as an
eternity, rendering him independent of all
others,—even he was thus soon fallen
<PB N="71" REF="82"/>
into the region of time and of suffer∣ing.</P>
<P>The present conflict of passion appeared
endless; he loved his father, and would have
been more shocked to consider the vexation
he was preparing for him, had he not been
resentful of the contempt he expressed for
Ellena. He adored Ellena; and, while he
felt the impractability of resigning his hopes,
was equally indignant of the slander, which
affected her name, and impatient to avenge
the insult upon the original defamer.</P>
<P>Though the displeasure of his father con∣cerning
a marriage with Ellena had been
already foreseen, the experience of it was
severer and more painful than he had ima∣gined;
while the indignity offered to Ellena
was as unexpected as intolerable. But this
circumstance furnished him with an addi∣tional
argument for addressing her; for, if it
had been possible that his love could have
paused, his honour seemed now engaged in
her behalf; and, since he had been a means
of sullying her fame, it became his duty to
<PB N="72" REF="83"/>
restore it. Willingly listening to the dic∣tates
of a duty so plausible, he determined
to persevere in his original design. But his
first efforts were directed to discover her
slanderer, and recollecting, with surprize,
those words of the Marchese, which had
confessed a knowledge of his evening visits
to the villa Altieri, the doubtful warnings of
the monk seemed explained. He believed
that this man was at once, the spy of his
steps, and the defamer of his love, till the
inconsistency of such conduct with the
seeming friendliness of his admonitions,
struck Vivaldi and compelled him to believe
the contrary.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the heart of Ellena had been
little less tranquil. It was divided by love
and pride; but had she been acquainted
with the circumstances of the late interview
between the Marchese and Vivaldi, it would
have been divided no longer, and a just
regard for her own dignity would instantly
have taught her to subdue, without diffi∣culty,
this infant affection.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="84"/>
Signora Bianchi had informed her niece
of the subject of Vivaldi's visit; but she
had, softened the objectionable circum∣stances
that attended his proposal, and had,
at first, merely hinted that it was not to be
supposed his family would approve a con∣nection
with any person so much their in∣ferior
in rank as herself. Ellena, alarmed
by this suggestion, replied, that, since she
believed so, she had done right to reject
Vivaldi's suit; but her sigh, as she said this,
did not escape the observation of Signora
Bianchi, who ventured to add, that she had
not <HI>absolutely</HI> rejected his offers.</P>
<P>While in this and future conversations,
Ellena was pleased to perceive her secret
admiration thus justified by an approbation
so indisputable as that of her aunt, and
was willing to believe that the circum∣stance,
which had alarmed her just pride, was
not so humiliating as she at first imagined,
Bianchi was careful to conceal the real con∣siderations,
which had induced her to listen
to Vivaldi, being well assured that they
<PB N="74" REF="85"/>
would have no weight with Ellena, whose
generous heart and inexperienced mind
would have revolted from mingling any
motives of interest with an engagement so
sacred as that of marriage. When, how∣ever,
from further deliberation upon the
advantages, which such an alliance must
secure for her niece, Signora Bianchi de∣termined
to encourage his views, and to
direct the mind of Ellena, whose affections
were already engaged on her side, the opi∣nions
of the latter were found less ductile
than had been expected. She was shocked at
the idea of entering clandestinely the family of
Vivaldi. But Bianchi, whose infirmities urg∣ed
her wishes, was now so strongly convinced
of the prudence of such an engagement for
her niece, that me determined to prevail
over her reluctance, though she perceived
that this must be by means more gradual
and persuasive than she had believed neces∣sary.
On the evening, when Vivaldi had
surprised from Ellena an acknowledgment
of her sentiments, her embarrassment and
<PB N="75" REF="86"/>
vexation, on her returning to the house,
and-relating what had occurred, sufficiently
expressed to Signora Bianchi the exact
situation of her heart. And when, on the
following morning, his letter arrived, writ∣ten
with the simplicity and energy of truth,
the aunt neglected not to adapt her remarks
upon it, to the character of Ellena, with
her usual address.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after the late interview with the
Marchese, passed the remainder of the day
in considering various plans, which might
discover to him the person, who had abused
the credulity of his father; and in the
evening he returned once more to the villa
Altieri, not in secret, to serenade the dark
balcony of his mistress, but openly, and to
converse with Signora Bianchi, who now
received him more courteously than on his
former visit. Attributing the anxiety in his
countenance to the uncertainty, concerning
the disposition of her niece, she was neither
surprised or offended, but ventured to re∣lieve
him from a part of it, by encouraging
<PB N="76" REF="87"/>
his hopes. Vivaldi dreaded lest she should
enquire further respecting the sentiments of
his family, but she spared both his delicacy
and her own on this point; and, after a
conversation of considerable length, he left
the villa Altieri with a heart somewhat
soothed by approbation, and lightened by
hope, although he had not obtained a sight
of Ellena. The disclosure she had made of
her sentiments on the preceding evening,
and the hints she had received as to those
of his family, still wrought upon her mind
with too much effect to permit an inter∣view.</P>
<P>Soon after his return to Naples, the
Marchesa, whom he was surprised to find
disengaged, sent for him to her closet,
where a scene passed similar to that which
had occurred with his father, except
that the Marchesa was more dexter∣ous
in her questions, and more subtle in
her whole conduct; and that Vivaldi,
never for a moment, forgot the decorum
which was due to a mother. Managing
<PB N="77" REF="88"/>
his passions, rather than exasperating them,
and deceiving him with respect to the de∣gree
of resentment she felt from his choice,
she was less passionate than the Marchese
in her observations and menaces, perhaps,
only because she entertained more hope
than he did of preventing the evil me con∣templated.</P>
<P>Vivaldi quitted her, unconvinced-by her
arguments, unsubdued by her prophecies,
and unmoved in his designs. He was not
alarmed, because he did not suffciently un∣derstand
her character to apprehend her
purposes. Despairing to effect these by
open violence, she called in an auxiliary of
no mean talents, and whose character and
views well adapted him to be an instrument
in her hands. It was, perhaps, the base∣ness
of her own heart, not either depth of
reflexion or keenness of penetration, which
enabled her to understand the nature of
his; and she determined to modulate that
nature to her own views.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="89"/>
There lived in the Dominican convent
of the Spirito Santo, at Naples, a man
called father Schedoni; an Italian, as his
name imported, but whose family was un∣known,
and from some circumstances, it
appeared, that he wished to throw an im∣penetrable
veil over his origin. For what∣ever
reason, he was never heard to mention
a relative, or the place of his nativity, and
he had artfully eluded every enquiry that
approached the subject, which the curiosity
of his associates had occasionally prompted.
There were circumstances, however, which
appeared to indicate him to be a man of
birth, and of fallen fortune; his spirit, as
it had sometimes looked forth from under
the disguise of his manners, seemed lofty;
it shewed not, however, the aspirings of a
generous mind, but rather the gloomy
pride of a disappointed one. Some few
persons in the convent, who had been in∣terested
by his appearance, believed that
the peculiarities of his manners, his severe
reserve and unconquerable silence, his so∣litary
<PB N="79" REF="90"/>
habits and frequent penances, were
the effect of misfortunes preying upon a
haughty and disordered spirit; while others
conjectured them the consequence of some
hideous crime gnawing upon an awaken∣ed
conscience.</P>
<P>He would sometimes abstract himself from
the society for whole days together, or when
with such a disposition he was compelled
to mingle with it, he seemed unconscious
where he was, and continued shrouded in
meditation and silence till he was again
alone. There were times when it was un∣known
whither he had retired, notwith∣standing
that his steps had been watched,
and his customary haunts examined. No
one ever heard him complain. The elder
brothers of the convent said that he had
talents, but denied him learning; they ap∣plauded
him for the profound subtlety
which he occasionally discovered in argu∣ment,
but observed that he seldom per∣ceived
truth when it lay on the surface;
he could follow it through all the labyrinths
<PB N="80" REF="91"/>
of disquisition, but overlooked it, when it
was undisguised before him. In fact he
cared not for truth, nor sought it by bold
and broad argument, but loved to exert the
wily cunning of his nature in hunting it
through artificial perplexities. At length,
from a habit of intricacy and suspicion, his
vitiated mind could receive nothing for
truth, which was simple and easily compre∣hended.</P>
<P>Among his associates no one loved him,
many disliked him, and more feared him.
His figure was striking, but not so from
grace; it was tall, and, though extremely
thin, his limbs were large and uncouth, and
as he stalked along, wrapt in the black gar∣ments
of his order, there was something
terrible in its air; something almost super∣human.
His cowl, too, as it threw a shade
over the livid paleness of his face, encreas∣ed
its severe character, and gave an effect
to his large melancholy eye, which ap∣proached
to horror. His was not the me∣lancholy
of a sensible and wounded heart,
<PB N="81" REF="92"/>
but apparently that of a gloomy and sero∣cious
disposition. There was something in
his physiognomy extremely singular, and
that can not easily be defined. It bore the
traces of many passions, which seemed to
have fixed the features they no longer ani∣mated.
An habitual gloom and severity
prevailed over the deep lines of his coun∣tenance;
and his eyes were so piercing that
they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemed to penetrate, at a single glance
into the hearts of men, and to read their
most secret thoughts; few persons could
support their scrutiny, or even endure to
meet them twice. Yet, notwithstanding
all this gloom and austerity, some rare oc∣casions
of interest had called forth a charac∣ter
upon his countenance entirely different;
and he could adapt himself to the tempers
and passions of persons, whom he wished
to conciliate, with astonishing facility, and
generally with complete triumph. This monk,
this Schedoni, was the confessor and secret
adviser of the Marchesa di Vivaldi. In the
first effervescence of pride and indignation,
<PB N="82" REF="93"/>
which the discovery of her son's intended
marriage occasioned, she consulted him on
the means of preventing it, and she soon
perceived that his talents promised to equal
her wishes. Each possessed, in a consider∣able
degree, the power of assisting the
other; Schedoni had subtlety with ambi∣tion
to urge it; and the Marchesa had in∣exorable
pride, and courtly influence; the
one hoped to obtain a high benefice for his
services, and the other to secure the ima∣ginary
dignity of her house, by her gifts.
Prompted by such passions, and allured by
such views, they concerted in private, and
unknown even to the Marchese, the means
of accomplishing their general end.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, as he quitted his mother's closet,
had met Schedoni in the corridor leading
thither. He knew him to be her confessor,
and was not much surprised to see him,
though the hour was an unusual one.
Schedoni bowed his head, as he passed, and
assumed a meek and holy countenance; but
Vivaldi, as he eyed him with a penetrating
<PB N="83" REF="94"/>
glance, now recoiled with involuntary emo∣tion;
and it seemed as if a shuddering pre∣sentiment
of what this monk was preparing
for him, had crossed his mind.</P>

<BIBL>JULIUS CAESAR.</BIBL></Q>
<P>VIVALDI, from the period of his last
visit to Altieri, was admitted a frequent vi∣sitor
to Signora Bianchi, and Ellena was,
at length, prevailed upon to join the party,
when the conversation was always on indifferent
topics. Bianchi, understanding the
disposition of her niece's affections, and the
accomplished mind and manners of Vivaldi,
judged that he was more likely to succeed
by silent attentions than by a formal decla∣rtion
of his sentiments. By such declara∣tion,
Ellena, till her heart was more en∣gaged
in his cause, would, perhaps, have
been alarmed into an absolute rejection of his
addresses, and this was every day less likely
<PB N="85" REF="96"/>
to happen, so long as he had an opportu∣nity
of conversing with her.</P>
<P>Signora Bianchi had acknowledged to
Vivaldi that he had no rival to apprehend;
that Ellena had uniformly rejected every
admirer who had hitherto discovered her
within the shade of her retirement, and that
her present reserve proceeded more from
considerations of the sentiments of his fa∣mily
than from disapprobation of himself.
He forbore, therefore, to press his suit, till
he should have secured a stronger interest
in her heart, and in this hope he was en∣couraged
by Signora Bianchi, whose gentle
remonstrances in his favour became every
day more pleasing and more convincing.</P>
<P>Several weeks passed away in this kind
of intercourse, till Ellena, yielding to the
representations of Signora Bianchi, and to
the pleadings of her own heart, received
Vivaldi as an acknowledged admirer, and
the sentiments of his family were no longer
remembered, or, if remembered, it was
<PB N="86" REF="97"/>
with a hope that they might be overcome
by considerations more powerful.</P>
<P>The lovers, with Signora Bianchi and a
Signor Giotto, a distant relation of the
latter, frequently made excursions in the
delightful environs of Naples; for Vivaldi
was no longer anxious to conceal his at∣tachment,
but wished to contradict any re∣port
injurious to his love, by the publicity
of his conduct; while the consideration, that
Ellena's name had suffered by his late impru∣dence,
contributed, with the unsuspecting
innocence and sweetness of her manners
towards him, who had been the occasion
of her injuries, to mingle a sacred pity
with his love, which obliterated all family
politics from his mind, and bound her ir∣recoverably
to his heart.</P>
<P>These excursions sometimes led them to
Puzzuoli, Baia, or the woody cliffs of Pau∣silippo,
and as, on their return, they glided
along the moon-light bay, the melodies of
Italian strains seemed to give enchantment
to the scenery of its shore. At this cool
<PB N="87" REF="98"/>
hour the voices of the vine-dressers were
frequently heard in trio, as they reposed,
after the labour of the day, on some plea∣sant
promontory, under the shade of pop∣lars;
or the brisk music of the dance from
fishermen, on the margin of the waves be∣low.
The boatmen rested on their oars,
while their company listened to voices mo∣dulated
by sensibility to finer eloquence,
than is in the power of art alone to display;
and at others, while they observed the airy
natural grace, which distinguishes the dance
of the fishermen and peasants of Naples.
Frequently as they glided round a pro∣montory,
whose shaggy masses impended far
over the sea, such magic scenes of beauty
unfolded, adorned by these dancing groups
on the bay beyond, as no pencil could do
justice to. The deep clear waters reflected
every image of the landscape, the cliffs,
branching into wild forms, crowned with
groves, whose rough foliage often spread
down their steeps in picturesque luxuriance;
the ruined villa on some bold point, peep∣ing
<PB N="88" REF="99"/>
through the trees; peasants' cabins
hanging on the precipices, and the dancing
figures on the strand—all touched with the
silvery tint and soft shadows of moon-light.
On the other hand, the sea trembling with
a long line of radiance, and shewing in the
clear distance the sails of vessels stealing in
every direction along its surface, presented
a prospect as grand as the landscape was
beautiful.</P>
<P>One evening that Vivaldi sat with Ellena
and Signora Bianchi, in the very pavilion
where he had overheard that short but in∣teresting
soliloquy, which assured him of her
regard, he pleaded with more than his usual
earnestness for a speedy marriage. Bianchi
did not oppose his arguments; she had been
unwell for some time, and, believing herself
to be declining fast, was anxious to have
their nuptials concluded. She surveyed with
languid eyes, the scene that spread before
the pavilion. The strong effulgence which
a setting-sun threw over the sea, shewing
innumerable gaily painted ships, and fishing∣boats
<PB N="89" REF="100"/>
returning from Santa Lucia into the
port of Naples, had no longer power to
cheer her. Even the Roman tower that
terminated the mole below, touched as it
was with the slanting rays; and the various
figures of fishermen, who lay smoking be∣neath
its walls, in the long shadow, or stood
in the sunshine on the beach, watching the
approaching boats of their comrades, com∣bined
a picture which was no longer in∣teresting.
“Alas!” said she, breaking
from meditative silence, “this sun so glo∣rious,
which lights up all the various co∣louring
of these shores, and the glow of
those majestic mountains; alas! I feel that
it will not long shine for me—my eyes must
soon close upon the prospect for ever!”</P>
<P>To Ellena's tender reproach for this melan∣choly
suggestion Bianchi replied only by ex∣pressing
an earnest wish to witness the certain∣ty
of her being protected; adding, that this
must be soon, or she should not live to see
it. Ellena, extremely shocked both by this
presage of her aunt's fate, and by the direct
<PB N="90" REF="101"/>
reference made to her own condition in the
presence of Vivaldi, burst into tears, while
he, supported by the wishes of Signora
Bianchi, urged his suit with encreased in∣terest.</P>
<P>“This is not a time for fastidious scru∣ples,”
said Bianchi, “now that a solemn
truth calls out to us. My dear girl, I will
not disguise my feelings; they assure me
I have not long to live. Grant me then
the only request I have to make, and my
last hours will be comforted.”</P>
<P>After a pause she added, as she took the
hand of her niece, “This will, no doubt,
be an awful separation to us both; and it
must also be a mournful one, Signor,”
turning to Vivaldi, “for she has been as a
daughter to me, and I have, I trust, fulfilled
to her the duties of a mother. Judge then,
what will be her feelings when I am no
more. But it will be your care to sooth
them.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked at Ellena, and would have
spoken; her aunt, however, proceeded.
<PB N="91" REF="102"/>
“My own feelings would now be little less
poignant, if I did not believe that I was
confiding her to a tenderness, which cannot
diminish; that I should prevail with her to
accept the protection of a husband. To
you, Signor, I commit the legacy of my
child. Watch over her future moments,
guard her from inquietude as vigilantly
as I have done, and, if possible, from mis∣fortune!
I have yet much to say, but my
spirits are exhausted.”</P>
<P>While he listened to this sacred charge,
and recollected the injury Ellena had al∣ready
sustained for his sake, by the cruel
obliquy which the Marchese had thrown
upon her character, he suffered a degree of
generous indignation, f which he scarcely
could conceal the cause, and a succeeding
tenderness that almost melted him to tears;
and he secretly vowed to defend her fame
and protect her peace, at the sacrifice of
every other consideration.</P>
<P>Bianchi, as she concluded her exhorta∣tion,
gave Ellena's hand to Vivaldi, who
<PB N="92" REF="103"/>
received it with emotion such as his coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nance,
only, could express, and with solemn
fervour raising his eyes to heaven, vowed
that he never would betray the confidence
thus reposed in him, but would watch over
the happiness of Ellena with a care as ten∣der,
as anxious, and as unceasing as her
own; that from this moment he considered
himself bound by ties not less sacred than
those which the church confers, to defend
her as his wife, and would do so to the
latest moment of his existence. As he said
this, the truth of his feelings appeared in
the energy of his manner.</P>
<P>Ellena, stiil weeping, and agitated by va∣rious
considerations, spoke not, but with
drawing the handkerchief from her face,
she looked at him through her tears, with
a smile so meek, so affectionate, so timid,
yet so confiding, as expressed all the mingled
emotions of her heart, and appealed more
eloquently to his, than the most energetic
language could have done.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="104"/>
Before Vivaldi left the villa, he had some
further conversation with Signora Bianchi,
when it was agreed that the nuptials should
be solemnized on the following week, if
Ellena could be prevailed on to confirm
her consent so soon; and that when he re∣turned
the next day, her determination
would probably be made known to him.</P>
<P>He departed for Naples once more with
the lightly-bounding steps of joy, which,
however, when he arrived there, was some∣what
alloyed by a message from the Mar∣chese,
demanding to see him in his cabinet.
Vivaldi anticipated the subject of the interview,
and obeyed the summons with reluctance.</P>
<P>He found his father so absorbed in
thought, that he did not immediately per∣ceive
him. On raising his eyes from the
floor, where discontent and perplexity
seemed to have held them, he fixed a stern
regard on Vivaldi. “I understand,” said
he, “that you persist in the unworthy pur∣suit
against which I warned you. I have
left you thus long to your own discretion,
<PB N="94" REF="105"/>
because I was willing to afford you an op∣portunity
of retracting with grace the de∣claration,
which you have dared to make me
of your principles and intentions; but your
conduct has not therefore been the less ob∣served.
I am informed that your visits have
been as frequent at the residence of the un∣happy
young woman, who was the subject
of our former conversation, as formerly,
and that you are as much infatuated.”</P>
<P>“If it is Signora Rosalba, whom your
lordship means,” said Vivaldi, “she is not
unhappy; and I do not scruple to own,
that I am as sincerely attached to her as
ever. Why, my dear father,” continued
he, subduing the feelings which this de∣grading
mention of Ellena had aroused,
“why will you persist in opposing the hap∣piness
of your son; and above all, why will
you continue to think unjustly of her, who
deserves your admiration, as much as my
love?”</P>
<P>“As I am not a lover,” replied the
Marchese, “and that the age of boyish
<PB N="95" REF="106"/>
credulity is past with me, I do not wilfully
close my mind against examination, but am
directed by proof and yield to conviction.”</P>
<P>“What proof is it, my Lord, that has
thus easily convinced you?” said Vivaldi;
“Who is it that persists in abusing your
considence, and in destroying my peace?”</P>
<P>The Marchese haughtily reproved his son
for such doubts and questions, and a long
conversation ensued, which seemed neither
to reconcile the interests or the opinions
of either party. The Marchese persisted
in accusation and menace; and Vivaldi in
defending Ellena, and in affirming, that his
affections and intentions were irrecover∣able.</P>
<P>Not any art of persuasion could prevail
with the Marchese to adduce his proofs, or
deliver up the name of his informer; nor
any menace awe Vivaldi into a renunciation
of Ellena; and they parted mutually dis∣satisfied.
The Marchese had failed on this
occasion to act with his usual policy, for his
menaces and accusations had aroused spirit
<PB N="96" REF="107"/>
and indignation, when kindness and gentle
remonstrance would certainly have, awa∣kened
filial affection, and might have occa∣sioned
a contest in the breast of Vivaldi.
Now, no struggle of opposing duties divided
his resolution. He had no hesitation on
the subject of their dispute; but, regarding
his father as a haughty oppressor who would
rob him of his most sacred right; and as
one who did not scruple to stain the name
of the innocent and the defenceless, when
his interest required it, upon the doubtful
authority of a base informer, he suffered
neither pity or remorse to mingle with the
resolution of asserting the freedom of his
nature; and was even more anxious than
before, to conclude a marriage which he
believed would secure his own happiness,
and the reputation of Ellena.</P>
<P>He returned, therefore, on the following
day to the villa Altieri, with encreased im∣patience
to learn the result of Signora Bian∣chi's
further conversation with her niece,
and the day on which the nuptials might
<PB N="97" REF="108"/>
be solemnized. On the way thither, his
thoughts were wholly occupied by Ellena,
and he proceeded mechanically, and with∣out
observing where he was, till the shade
which the well-known arch threw over the
road recalled him to local circumstances,
and a voice instantly arrested his attention.
It was the voice of the monk, whose figure
again passed before him. “Go not to the
villa Altieri,” it said solemnly, “for death
is in the house!”</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi could recover from the
dismay into which this abrupt assertion and
sudden appearance had thrown him, the
stranger was gone. He had escaped in the
gloom of the place, and seemed to have re∣tired
into the obscurity, from which he had
so suddenly emerged, for he was not seen
to depart from under the archway. Vivaldi
pursued him with his voice, conjuring him
to appear, and demanding who was dead;
but no voice replied.</P>
<P>Believing that the stranger could not have
escaped unseen from the arch by any way,
<PB N="98" REF="109"/>
but that leading to the fortress above, Vivaldi
began to ascend the steps, when, considering
that the more certain means of understand∣ing
this awful assertion would be, to go im∣mediately
to the villa Altieri, he left this
portentous ruin, and hastened thither.</P>
<P>An indifferent person would probably
have understood the words of the monk to
allude to Signora Bianchi, whose infirm
state of health rendered her death, though
sudden, not improbable; but to the af∣frighted
fancy of Vivaldi, the dying Ellena
only appeared. His fears, however proba∣bilities
might sanction, or the event justify
them, were natural to ardent affection;
but they were accompanied by a presenti∣ment
as extraordinary as it was horrible;—it
occurred to him more than once, that
Ellena was murdered. He saw her wound∣ed,
and bleeding to death; saw her ashy
countenance, and her wasting eyes, from
which the spirit of life was fast departing,
turned pireously on himself, as if imploring
him to save her from the fate that was
<PB N="99" REF="110"/>
dragging her to the grave. And, when
he reached the boundary of the garden,
his Whole frame trembled so, with horrible
apprehension, that he rested a while, unable
to venture further towards the truth. At
length, he summoned courage to dare it,
and, unlocking a private gate, of which he
had lately received the key, because it spared
him a considerable distance of the road to
Naples, he approached the house. Every
place around it was silent and forsaken;
many of the lattices were closed, and, as he
endeavoured to collect from every trivial
circumstance some conjecture, his spirits still
sunk as he advanced, till, having arrived
within a few paces of the portico, all his
fears were confirmed. He heard from with∣in
a feeble sound of lamentation, and then
some notes of that solemn and peculiar kind
of recitative, which is in some parts of Italy
the requiem of the dying. The sounds
were so low and distant that they only mur∣mured
on his ear; but, without pausing
for information, he rushed into the portico,
<PB N="100" REF="111"/>
and knocked loudly at the folding doors,
now closed against him.</P>
<P>After repeated summonses, Beatrice, the
old house-keeper, appeared. She did not
wait for Vivaldi's enquiries. “Alas! Sig∣nor,”
said she, “alas-a-day! who would
have thought it; who would have expec∣ted
such a change as this! It was only yes∣ter-evening
that you was here,—see was
then as well as I am; who would have
thought that she would be dead to-day?”</P>
<P>“She <HI>is</HI> dead, then!” exclaimed Vival∣di,
struck to the heart; “she <HI>is</HI> dead!”
staggering towards a pillar of the hall, and
endeavouring to support himself against it.
Beatrice, shocked at his condition, would
have gone for assistance, but he waved her
to stay. “When did she die,” said he,
drawing breath withdifficulty, “how and
where?”</P>
<P>“Alas! here in the villa, Signor,” re∣plied
Beatrice, weeping; “who would have
thought that I should live to see this day!
<PB N="101" REF="112"/>
I hoped to have laid down my old bones
in peace.”</P>
<P>“What has caused her death?” inter∣rupted
Vivaldi impatiently, “and when
did she die?”</P>
<P>“About two of the clock this morning,
Signor; about two o'clock. O miserable
day, that I should live to see it!”</P>
<P>“I am better,” said Vivaldi, raising himself;
“lead me to her apartment,—I must
see her. Do not hesitate, lead me on.”</P>
<P>“Alas! Signor, it is a dismal sight;
why should you wish to see her? Be per∣suaded;
do not go, Signor; it is a woeful
sight!”</P>
<P>“Lead me on,” repeated Vivaldi stern∣ly;
“or if you refuse, I will find the way
myself.”</P>
<P>Beatrice, terrified by his look and ges∣ture,
no longer opposed him, begging only
that he would wait till she had informed
her lady of his arrival; but he followed
her closely up the staircase and along a
corridor that led round the west side of the
<PB N="102" REF="113"/>
house, which brought him to a suite of
chambers darkened by the closed lattices,
through which he passed towards the one
where the body lay. The requiem had
ceased, and no sound disturbed the awful
stillness that prevailed in these deserted
rooms. At the door of the last apartment,
where he was compelled to stop, his agita∣tion
was such, that Beatrice, expecting
every instant to see him sink to the floor,
made an effort to support him with her
feeble aid, but he gave a signal for her to
retire. He soon recovered himself and
passed into the chamber of death, the so∣lemnity
of which might have affected him
in any other state of his spirits; but these
were now too severely pressed upon by real
suffering to feel the influence of local cir∣cumstances.
Approaching the bed on which
the corpse was laid, he raised his eyes to the
mourner who hung weeping over it, and
beheld—Ellena! who, surprized by this
sudden intrusion, and still more by the agi∣tation
of Vivaldi, repeatedly demanded the
<PB N="103" REF="114"/>
occasion of it. But he had neither power
or inclination to explain a circumstance,
which must deeply wound the heart of
Ellena, since it would have told that the
same event, which excited her grief, acci∣dentally
inspired his joy.</P>
<P>He did not long intrude upon the sacred∣ness
of sorrow, and the short time he re∣mained
was employed in endeavours to
command his own emotion and to soothe
her's.</P>
<P>When he left Ellena, he had some con∣versation
with Beatrice, as to the death of
Signora Bianchi, and understood that she
had retired to rest on the preceding night
apparently in her usual state of health.
“It was about one in the morning, Signor,”
continued Beatrice, “I was waked out of
my first sleep by a noise in my lady's cham∣ber.
It is a grievous thing to me, Sig∣nor,
to be waked from my first sleep, and
I, Santa Maria forgive me! was angry at
being disturbed! So I would not get up,
but laid my head upon the pillow again,
<PB N="104" REF="115"/>
and tried to sleep; but presently I heard
the noise again; nay now, says I, somebody
must be up in the house, that's certain. I
had scarcely said so, Signor, when I heard
my young lady's voice calling “Beatrice!
Beatrice!” Ah! poor young lady! she was
indeed in a sad fright, as well she might.
She was at my door in an instant, and look∣ed
as pale as death, and trembled so! “Bea∣trice,”
said she, “rise this moment; my aunt
is dying.” She did not stay for my answer,
but was gone directly. Santa Maria pro∣tect
me! I thought I should have swooned
outright.”</P>
<P>“Well, but your lady?” said Vivaldi,
whose patience the tedious circumlocution
of old Beatrice had exhausted.</P>
<P>“Ah! my poor lady! Signor, I thought
I never should have been able to reach her
room; and when I got there, I was scarce∣ly
more alive than herself.—There she lay
on her bed! O it was a grievous sight to
see! there she lay, looking so piteously; I
saw she was dying. She could not speak,
<PB N="105" REF="116"/>
though she tried often, but she was sensible,
for she would look so at Signora Ellena,
and then try again to speak; it almost
broke one's heart to see her. Something
seemed to lie upon her mind, and she tried
almost to the last to tell it; and as she
grasped Signora Ellena's hand, she would
still look up in her face with such doleful
expression as no one who had not a heart
of stone could bear. My poor young mis∣tress
was quite overcome by it, and cried
as if her heart would break. Poor young
lady! she has lost a friend indeed, such a
one as she must never hope to see again.”</P>
<P>“But she shall find one as sirm and af∣fectionate
as the last!” exclaimed Vivaldi
fervently.</P>
<P>“The good Saint grant it may prove
so!” replied Beatrice, doubtingly. “All
that could be done for our dear lady,” she
continued, “was tried, but with no avail.
She could not swallow what the Doctor of∣fered
her. She grew fainter and fainter, yet
would often utter such deep sighs, and then
<PB N="106" REF="117"/>
would grasp my hand so hard! At last she
turned her eyes from Signora Ellena, and
they grew duller and fixed, and she seemed
not to see what was before her. Alas! I
knew then she was going; her hand did
not press mine as it had done a minute or
two before, and a deadly coldness was upon
it. Her face changed so too in a few mi∣nutes!
This was about two o'clock, and
she died before her confessor could admi∣nister.”</P>
<P>Beatrice ceased to speak, and wept; Vi∣valdi
almost wept with her, and it was
some time before he could command his
voice sufficiently to enquire, what were the
symptoms of Signora Bianchi's disorder,
and whether she had ever been thus sud∣denly
attacked before.</P>
<P>“Never, Signor!” replied the old house∣keeper;
“and though, to be sure, she has
long been very infirm, and going down, as
one may say, yet,”—</P>
<P>“What is it you mean?” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="118"/>
“Why, Signor, I do not know what to
think about my lady's death. To be sure,
there is nothing certain; and I may only
get scoffed at, if speak my mind abroad,
for nobody would believe me, it is so
strange, yet I must have my own thoughts,
for all that.”</P>
<P>“Do speak intelligibly,” said Vivaldi,
“you need not apprehend censure from
me.”</P>
<P>“Not from you, Signor, but if the re∣port
should get abroad, and it was known
that I had set it a-going.”</P>
<P>“That never shall be known; from me,”
said Vivaldi, with encreased impatience,
“tell me, without fear, all that you con∣jecture.”</P>
<P>“Well then, Signor, I will own, that I
do not like, the suddenness of my lady's
death, no, nor the manner of it, nor her
appearance after death!”</P>
<P>“Speak explicitly, and to the point,”
siad Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="119"/>
“Nay, Signor, there are some folks that
will not understand if you speak ever so
plain, I am sure I speak plain enough. If
I might tell my mind,—I do not believe
she came fairly by her death at last!”</P>
<P>“How!” said Vivaldi, “your reasons?”</P>
<P>“Nay, Signor, I have given them al∣ready;
I said I did not like the suddenuess
of her death, nor her appearance after,
nor”—</P>
<P>“Good heaven!” interrupted Vivaldi,
“you mean poison!”</P>
<P>“Hush, Signor, hush! I do not say that;
but she did not seem to die naturally.”</P>
<P>“Who has been at the villa lately?”
said Vivaldi, in a tremulous voice.</P>
<P>“Alas! Signor, nobody has been here;
she lived so privately that she saw nobody.”</P>
<P>“Not one person?” said Vivaldi, “con∣sider
well, Beatrice, had she no visitor?”</P>
<P>“Not of a long while, Signor, no vi∣sitors
but yourself and her cousin Signor
Giotto. The only other person that has
been within these walls for many weeks, to
<PB N="109" REF="120"/>
the best of my remembrance, is a sister of the
Convent, who comes for the silks my young
lady embroiders.”</P>
<P>“Embroiders! What convent?”</P>
<P>“The Santa Maria della Pieta, yonder,
Signor; if you will step this way to the
window, I will shew it you. Yonder,
among the woods on the hill-side, just a∣bove
those gardens that stretch down to
the bay. There is an olive ground close
beside it, and observe, Signor, there is a
red and yellowish ridge of rocks rises over
the woods higher still, and looks as if it
would fall down upon those old spires.
Have you found it, Signor?”</P>
<P>“How long is it since this sister came
here?” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Three weeks at Ieast, Signor.”</P>
<P>“And you are certain that no other
person has called within that time?”</P>
<P>“No other, Signor, except the fisher∣man
and the gardener, and a man who
brings maccaroni, and such sort of things;
<PB N="110" REF="121"/>
for it is such a long way to Naples, Signor,
and I have so little time.</P>
<P>“Three weeks, say you! You said three
weeks, I think? Are you certain as to
this?”</P>
<P>“Three weeks, Signor! Santa della
Pieta! Do you believe, Signor, that we
could fast for three weeks! Why, they call
almost every day.”</P>
<P>“I speak of the nun,” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“O yes, Signor,” replied Beatrice; “it
is that, at least, since she was here.”</P>
<P>“This is strange!” said Vivaldi, musing,
“but I will talk with you some other time.
Meanwhile, Iwish you could contrive that
I should see the face of your deceased lady,
without the knowledge of Signora Ellena.
And, observe me, Beatrice, be strictly silent
as to your surmises concerning her death:
do not suffer any negligence to betray your
suspicions to your young mistress. Has
she any suspicions herself of the same na∣ture.”</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="122"/>
Beatrice replied, that she believed Sig∣nora
Ellena had none; and promised faith∣fully
to observe his injunctions.</P>
<P>He then left the villa, meditating on the
circumstances he had just learned, and on
the prophetic assertion of the monk, be∣tween
whom, and the cause of Bianchi's
sudden death, he could not forbear surmising
there was some connection; and it
now occurred to him, and for the first time,
that this monk, this mysterious stranger,
was no other than Schedoni, whom he had
observed of late going more frequently than
usual, to his mother's apartment. He al∣most
started, in horror of the suspicion, to
which this conjecture led, and precipitately
rejected it, as a poison that would destroy
his own peace for ever. But though he in∣stantly
dismissed the suspicion, the conjec∣ture
returned to his mind, and he endea∣voured
to recollect the voice and figure of
the stranger, that he might compare them
with those of the confessor. The voices
were, he thought, of a different tone, and
<PB N="112" REF="123"/>
the persons of a different height and pro∣portion.
This comparison, however, did
not forbid him to surmise that the stranger
was an agent of the confessor's; that he
was, at least, a secret spy upon his actions,
and the defamer of Ellena; while both, if in∣deed
there were two persons concerned, ap∣peared
to be at the command of his parents.
Fired with indignation of the unworthy arts
that he believed to have been employed
against him, and impatient to meet the slan∣derer
of Ellena, he determined to attempt
some decisive step towards a discovery of
the truth, and either to compel the confessor
to reveal it to him, or to search out his
agent, who, he fancied, was occasionally
a resident within the ruins of Paluzzi.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the convent, which
Beatrice had pointed out, did not escape
his consideration, but no reason appeared
for supposing them the enemies of his El∣lena,
who, on the contrary, he understood
had been for some years amicably connect∣ed
with them. The embroidered silks, of
<PB N="113" REF="124"/>
which the old servant had spoken, suffi∣ciently
explained the nature of the con∣nection,
and discovering more fully the
circumstances os Ellena's fortune, her con∣duct
heightened the tender admiration, with
which he had hitherto regarded her.</P>
<P>The hints for suspicion which Beatrice
had given respecting the cause of her mis∣tress's
decease, incessantly recurred to him;
and it appeared extraordinary, and some∣times
in the highest degree improbable, that
any person could be sufficiently interested in
the death of a woman apparently so blame∣less,
as to administer poison to her. What
motive could have prompted so horrible a
deed, was still more inexplicable. It was
true that she had long been in a declining
state; yet the suddenness of her departure
and the singularity of some circumstances
preceding as well as some appearances that
had followed it, compelled Vivaldi to doubt
as to the caufe. He believed, however,
that, after having seen the corpse, his
doubts must vanish; and Beatrice had pro∣mised,
<PB N="114" REF="125"/>
that, if he could return in the even∣ing,
when Ellena had retired to rest, he
should be permitted to visit the chamber
of the deceased. There was something re∣pugnant
to his feelings, in going thus
secretly, or, indeed, at all, to the residence
of Ellena at this delicate period, yet it was
necessary he should introduce there some
medical professor, on whose judgment he
could rest, respecting the occasion of Bian∣chi's
death; and as he believed he should
so soon acquire the right of vindicating the
honour of Ellena, that consideration did not
so seriously affect him as otherwise it would
have done. The enquiry which called him
thither was, besides, of a nature too solemn
and important to be lightly resigned; he
had, therefore, told Beatrice he would be
punctual to the hour she appointed. His
intention to search for the monk, was thus
again interrupted.</P>

<Q><L>“Unfold th' impenetrable mystery,</L>
<L>That sets your soul and you at endless discord.”</L>
<BIBL>MYSTERIOUS MOTHER.</BIBL></Q>
<P>WHEN Vivaldi returned to Naples, he
enquired for the Marchesa, of whom he
wished to ask some questions concerning
Schedoni, which, though he scarcely ex∣pected
they would be explicitly answered,
might yet lead to part of the truth he
sought for.</P>
<P>The Marchesa was in her closet, and
Vivaldi found the confessor with her.
“This man crosses me, like my evil ge∣nius,”
said he to himself as he entered,
“but I will know whether he deserves my
suspicions before I leave the room.”</P>
<P>Schedoni was so deeply engaged in con∣versation,
that he did not immediately per∣ceive
Vivaldi, who stood for a moment
<PB N="116" REF="127"/>
examining his countenance, and tracing
subjects for curiosity in its deep lines. His
eyes, while he spoke, were cast downward,
and his features were fixed in an expression
at once severe and crafty. The Marchesa
was listening with deep attention, her head
inclined towards him, as if to catch the
lowest murmur of his voice, and her face
picturing the anxiety and vexation of her
mind. This was evidently a conference,
not a confession.</P>
<P>Vivaldi advancing, the monk raised his
eyes; his countenance suffered no change,
as they met those of Vivaldi. He rose,
but did not take leave, and returned the
slight and somewhat haughty salutation of
Vivaldi, with an inclination of the head,
that indicated a pride without pettishness,
and a firmness bordering on contempt.</P>
<P>The Marchesa, on perceiving her son,
was somewhat embarrassed, and her brow,
before slightly contracted by vexation, now
frowned with severity. Yet it was an in∣voluntary
emotion, for she endeavoured to
<PB N="117" REF="128"/>
chace the expression of it with a smile,
Vivaldi liked the smile still less than the
frown.</P>
<P>Schedoni seated himself quietly, and be∣gan,
with almost the ease of a man of the
world, to converse on general topics. Vi∣valdi,
however, was reserved and silent; he
knew not how to begin a conversation, which
might lead to the knowledge he desired,
and the Marchesa did not relieve him from
the difficulty. His eye and his ear assisted
him to conjecture at least, if not to obtain
the information he wished; and, as he
listened to the deep tones of Schedoni's
voice, he became almost certain, that they
were not the accents of his unknown ad∣viser,
though he considered, at the same
moment, that it was not difficult to disguise,
or to feign a voice. His stature seemed to
decide the question more reasonably; for
the figure of Schedoni appeared taller than
that of the stranger; and though there was
something of resemblance in their air,
which Vivaldi had never observed before,
<PB N="118" REF="129"/>
he again considered, that the habit of the
same order, which each wore, might easily
occasion an artificial resemblance. Of the
likeness, as to countenance, he could not
judge, since the stranger's had been so much
shrouded by his cowl, that Vivaldi <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had
never distinctly seen a single feature. Sche∣doni's
hood was now thrown back, so that
he could not compare even the air of their
heads under similar circumstances; but as
he remembered to have seen the confessor
on a former day approaching his mother's
closet with the cowl shading his face, the
same gloomy severity seemed to characterize
both, and nearly the same terrible portrait
was drawn on his fancy. Yet this again
might be only an artificial, effect, a cha∣racter
which the cowl alone gave to the
head; and any face seen imperfectly beneath
its dark shade, might have appeared equally
severe. Vivaldi, was still extremely per∣plexed
in his opinion. One circumstance,
however, seemed to throw some light on
his judgment. The stranger had appeared
<PB N="119" REF="130"/>
in the habit? of a monk, and, if Vivaldi's
transient observation might be trusted, he
was of the very same order with that of
Schedoni. Yet if he were Schedoni, or even
his agent, it was not probable that he would
have shewn himself in dress that might
lead to discovery of his person. That
he was anxious for concealment, his man∣ner
had strongly proved; it seemed then,
that this habit of a monk was only a dis∣guise,
assumed for the purpose of misleading
conjecture. Vivaldi, however, determined
to put some questions to Schedoni, and at
the same time to observe their effect on his
countenance. He took occasion to notice
some drawings of ruins, which ornamented
the cabinet of the Marchesa, and to say
that the fortress of Paluzzi was worthy of
being added to her collection. “You have
seen it lately, perhaps, reverend father,”
added Vivaldi, with penetrating glance.</P>
<P>“It is a striking relique of antiquity,”
replied the confessor.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="131"/>
“That arch,” resumed Vivaldi, his eye
still fixed on Schedoni, “that arch suspend∣ed
between two rocks, the one overtopped
by the towers of the fortress, the other
shadowed with pine and broad oak, has a
fine effect. But a picture of it would want
human figures. Now either the grotesque
shapes of banditti lurking within the ruin,
as if ready to start out upon the traveller,
or a friar rolled up in his black garments,
just stealing forth from under the shade of
the arch, and looking like some supernatural
messenger of evil, would finish the piece.”</P>
<P>The features of Schedoni suffered no
change during this speech. “Your pic∣ture
is complete,” said he, “and I cannot
but admire the facility with which you have
classed the monks together with banditti.”</P>
<P>“Your pardon, holy father,” said Vi∣valdi,
“I did not draw a parallel between
them.”</P>
<P>“O! no offence, Signor,” replied Sche∣doni,
with a smile somewhat ghastly.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="132"/>
During the latter, part of this conversa∣tion,
if conversation it may be called, the
Marchesa had followed a servant, who had
brought her a letter, out of the apartment,
and as the confessor appeared to await her
return, Vivaldi determined to press his en∣quiry.
“It appears, however,” said he,
“that Palluzzi, if not haunted by robbers,
is at least frequented by ecclesiastics; for I
have seldom passed it without seeing one of
the order, and that one has appeared so
suddenly, and vanished so suddenly, that I
have been almost compelled to believe he
was literally a spiritual being!”</P>
<P>“The convent of the Black Penitents
is not far distant,” observed the confessor,</P>
<P>“Does the dress of this convent resemble
that of your order, reverend father? for I
observed that the monk I speak of was
habited like yourself; aye, and he was
about your stature, and very much re∣sembled
you.”</P>
<P>“That well may be, Signor,” replied
the confessor calmly; “there are many
<PB N="122" REF="133"/>
brethren who, no doubt, resemble each
other; but the brothers of the Black Pe∣nitents
are clothed in sackcloth; and the
death's head on the garment, the peculiar
symbol of this order, would not have
escaped your observation; it could not,
therefore, be a member of their society
whom you have seen.”</P>
<P>“I am not inclined to think that it was,”
said Vivaldi; “but be it who it may, I hope
soon to be better acquainted with him, and
to tell him truths so strong, that he shall
not be permitted even to affect the mis∣understanding
of them.”</P>
<P>“You will do right, if you have cause
of complaint against him,” observed Sche∣doni.</P>
<P>“And <HI>only</HI> if I have cause of complaint,
holy father? Are strong truths to be told
only when there is direct cause of com∣plaint?
Is it only when we are injured that
we are to be sincere?” He believed that
he had now detected Schedoni, who seem∣ed
to have betrayed a consciousness that
<PB N="123" REF="134"/>
Vivaldi; had reason for complaint against
The stranger.</P>
<P>“You will observe, reverend father, that
I have not said I am injured,” he added.
“If you know that I am, this must be by
other means than by my words; I have
not even expressed resentment.”</P>
<P>“Except by your voice and, eye, Sig∣nor,”
replied Schedoni, drily. “When a
man is vehement and disordered, we usually
are inclined to suppose he feelsresentment,
and that he has cause of complaint, either
real or imaginary. As I have<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not the
honour of being acquainted with the sub∣ject
you allude to, I cannot decide to which
of the two your cause belongs.”</P>
<P>“I have never been in doubt as to that,”
said Vivaldi haughtily; “and if I had, you
will pardon me, holy father, but I should
not have requested your decision. My in∣juries
are, alas! too real; and I now think
it is also too certain to whom I may attri∣bute
them. The secret adviser, who steals
into the bosom of a family only to poison
<PB N="124" REF="135"/>
its repose, the informer—the base asperser
of innocence, stand revealed in one person,
before me.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi delivered these words with a
tempered energy, at once dignified and
pointed, which seemed to strike directly
to the heart of Schedoni; but, whether it
was his conscience or his pride that took
the alarm, did not certainly appear. Vi∣valdi
believed the former. A dark malig∣nity
overspread the features of the monk,
and at that moment Vivaldi thought he
beheld a man, whose passions might impel
him to the perpetration of almost any
crime, how hideous soever. He recoiled
from him, as if he had suddenly seen a ser∣pent
in his path, and stood gazing on his
face, with an attention so wholly occupied
as to be unconscious that he did so.</P>
<P>Schedoni almost instantly recovered him∣self;
his features relaxed from their first
expression, and that portentous darkness
passed away from his countenance; but
with a look that was still stern and haughty,
<PB N="125" REF="136"/>
he said, “Signor, however ignorant I may
be of the subject of your discontent, I can
not misunderstand that your resentment is,
to some extent or other, directed against
myself as the cause of it. Yet I will not
suppose, Signor; I say I will not suppose,”
raising his voice significantly, “that you
have dared to brand me with the ignomi∣nious
titles you have just uttered but”—</P>
<P>“I have applied them to the author of
my injuries,” interrupted-Vivaldi; “you,
father, can best inform me whether they
applied to yourself.”</P>
<P>“I have then nothing to complain of,”
said Schedoni, adroitly, and with a sudden
calmness, that surprised Vivaldi. “If you
directed them against the author of your
injuries, whatever they may be, I am satis∣fied.”</P>
<P>The chearful complacency, with which
he spoke this, renewed the doubts of Vi∣valdi,
who thought it nearly impossible that
a man conscious of guilt could assume,
under the very charge of it, the tranquil
<PB N="126" REF="137"/>
and dignified air, which the confessor
now displayed. He began to accuse him∣self
of having condemned him with pas∣sionate
rashness, and gradually became
shocked at the indecorum of his conduct
towards a man of Schedoni's age and sa∣cred
profession. Those expressions of coun∣tenance,
which had so much alarmed him,
he was now inclined to think the effect of a
jealous and haughty honour, and he almost
forgot the malignity, which had mingled
with Schedoni's pride, in sorrow for the
offence that had provoked it. Thus, not
less precipitate in his pity than his anger,
and credulous alike to the passion of the
moment, he was now as eager to apolo∣gize
for his error, as he had been hasty in
committing it. The frankness, with which
he apologized and lamented the impropriety
of his conduct, would have won an easy
forgiveness from a generous heart. Sche∣doni
listened with apparent complacency
and secret contempt. He regarded Vivaldi
as a rash boy, who was swayed only by his
<PB N="127" REF="138"/>
passions; but while, he suffered deep resent∣ment
for the evil in his character, he felt
neither respect nor kindness, for the good,
for the sincerity, the love of justice, the
generosity, which threw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a brilliancy even on
his foibles. Schedoni, indeed, saw only
evil in human nature.</P>
<P>Had the heart of Vivaldi been less ge∣nerous,
he would now have distrusted the
satisfaction, which the confessor assumed,
and have discovered the contempt and
malignity, that lurked behind the smile thus
imperfectly masking his countenance. The
confessor perceived his power, and the
character of Vivaldi lay before him as a
map. He saw, or fancied he saw every
line and feature of its plan, and the relative
proportions of every energy and weakness
of its nature. He believed, also, he could
turn the very virtues of this young man
against himself, and he exulted, even while
the smile of good-will was yet upon his
countenance, in anticipating the moment
that should avenge him for the past out∣rage,
<PB N="128" REF="139"/>
and which, while Vivaldi was inge∣nuously
lamenting it, he had apparently
forgotten.</P>
<P>Schedoni was thus ruminating evil against
Vivaldi, and Vivaldi was considering how
he might possibly make Schedoni atone∣ment
for the affront he had offered him,
when the Marchesa returned to the apart∣ment;
and perceived in the honest coun∣tenance
of Vivaldi some symptoms of the
agitation which had passed over it; his
complexion was flushed, and his brow
slightly contracted. The face of Schedoni
told nothing but complacency, except that
now and then when he looked at Vivaldi,
it was with half-shut eyes, that indicated
treachery, or, at least, cunning, trying to
conceal exasperated pride.</P>
<P>The Marchesa, with displeasure directed
against her son, enquired the reason of his
emotion; but he, stung with consciousness
of his conduct towards the monk, could
neither endure to explain it, or to remain
in her presence, and saying that he would,
<PB N="129" REF="140"/>
confide his honour to the discretion of the
holy father, who would speak only too
favourably of his fault, he abruptly left the
room.</P>
<P>When he had departed, Schedoni gave,
with seeming reluctance, the explanation
which the Marchesa required, but was
cautious not to speak too favourably of
Vivaldi's conduct, which, on the contrary,
he represented as much more insulting than
it really was; and, while he aggravated the
offensive part of it, he suppressed all men∣tion
of the candour and self-reproach, which
had followed the charge. Yet this he
managed so artfully that he appeared to
extenuate Vivaldi's errors, to lament the
hastiness of his temper, and to plead for a
forgiveness from his irritated mother. “He
is very young,” added the monk, when he
perceived that he had sufficiently exasperat∣ed
the Marchesa against her son; “he is
very young, and youth is warm in its pas∣sions
and precipitate in its judgments. He
was, besides, jealous, no doubt, of the
<PB N="130" REF="141"/>
friendship, with which you are pleased to
honour me; and it is natural that a son
should be jealous of the attention of such a
mother.”</P>
<P>“You are too good, father,” said the
Marchesa; her resentment encreasing to∣wards
Vivaldi in proportion as Schedoni
displayed his artificial candour and meek∣ness.</P>
<P>“It is true,” continued the confessor,
“that I perceive all the inconveniences to
which my attachment, I should say my duty
to your family exposes me; but I willingly
submit to these, while it is yet possible that
my advice may be a means of preserving
the honour of your house unsullied, and of
saving this inconsiderate young man from
future misery and unavailing repentance.”</P>
<P>During the warmth of this sympathy in
resentment, the Marchesa and Schedoni
mutually, and sincerely, lost their remem∣brance
of the unworthy motives, by which
each knew the other to be influenced, as
well as that disgust which those who act
<PB N="131" REF="142"/>
together to the same bad end, can seldom
escape from feeling towards their associates.
The Marchesa, while she commended the
fidelity of Schedoni, forgot his views and
her promises as to a rich benefice; while
the confessor imputed her anxiety for the
splendor of her son's condition to a real
interest in his welfare, not a care of her own
dignity. After mutual compliments had
been exchanged, they proceeded to a long
consultation concerning, Vivaldi, and it was
agreed, that their efforts for what they
termed his preservation should no longer
be consined to remonstrances.</P>

<Q><L>“What if it be a poison, which the friar</L>
<L>Subtly hath ministered?”—</L>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>VIVALDI, when his first feelings of pity
and compunction for having insulted an
aged man, the member of a sacred profes∣sion,
were past, and when he looked with a
more deliberate eye upon some circum∣stances
of the confessor's conduct, perceived
that suspicion was again gathering on his
mind. But, regarding this as a symptom
of his own weakness, rather than as a hint
of truth, he endeavoured, with a magna∣nimous
disdain, to reject every surmise that
boded unfavourably of Schedoni.</P>
<P>When evening arrived, he hastened to∣wards
the villa Altieri, and, having met
without the city, according to appointment,
a physician, upon whose honor and judg∣ment
<PB N="133" REF="144"/>
he thought he might rely, they pro∣ceeded
on their way together. Vivaldi had
forgotten, during the confusion of his last
interview with Ellena, to deliver up the key
of the garden-gate, and he now entered it
as usual, though he could not entirely over∣come
the reluctance, which he felt on thus
visiting, in secret and at night, the dwelling
of Ellena. Under no other circumstances,
however, could the physician, whose opi∣nion
was so necessary to his peace, be in∣troduced
without betraying a suspicion,
which must render her unhappy, probably
for ever.</P>
<P>Beatrice, who had watched for them in
the portico, led the way to the chamber
where the corpse was laid out; and Vivaldi,
though considerably affected when he en∣tered
soon recovered composure enough to
take his station on one side of the bed,
while the physician placed himself on the
other. Unwilling to expose his emotion to
the observation of a servant, and desirous
also of some private conversation with the
<PB N="134" REF="145"/>
physician, he took the lamp from Beatrice
and dismissed her. As the light glared
upon the livid face of the corpse Vivaldi
gazed with melancholy surprize, and an
effort of reason was necessary to convince
him, that this was the same countenance
which only one evening preceding was ani∣mated
like his own; which had looked
upon him in tears, while, with anxiety the
most tender, she had committed the happi∣ness
of her niece to his care, and had alas!
too justly predicted her approaching disso∣lution.
The circumstances of that scene
now appeared to him like a vision, and
touched every fibre of his heart. He was
fully sensible of the importance of the trust
committed to him, and, as he now hung over
the pale and deserted form of Bianchi, he
silently renewed his solemn vows to Ellena<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to deserve the confidence of her departed
guardian.</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi had courage enough to
ask the opinion of the physician, who was
still Viewing the face of the deceased with very
<PB N="135" REF="146"/>
earnest attention and disapproving counte∣nance,
his own suspicions strengthened from
some circumstances of her appearance; and
particularly form the black tint that pre∣vailed
over her complexion, it seemed to
him, that her death had been by poison.
He feared to break a silence, which pro∣longed
his hope of the contrary, feeble
though it was; and the physician, who pro∣bably
was apprehensive for the consequence
of delivering his real thought, did not
speak.</P>
<P>“I read your opinion,” said Vivaldi, at
length, “it coincides with my own.”</P>
<P>“I know not as to that, Signor,” re∣plied
the physician, “though I think I per∣ceive
what is yours. Appearances are un∣favourable,
yet I will not take upon me to
decide from them, that it is as you suspect.
There are other circumstances, under which
similar appearances might occur.” He gave
his reasons for this assertion which were
plausible even to Vivaldi, and concluded
with requesting to speak with Beatrice, “for
<PB N="136" REF="147"/>
I wish to understand,” said he, “what was
the exact situation of this lady for some
hours previous to her decease.”</P>
<P>After a conversation of some length with
Beatrice, whatever might be the opinion re∣sulting
from his enquiries, he adhered nearly
to his former assertions; pronouncing that
so many contradictory circumstances ap∣peared,
as rendered it impossible for him
to decide, whether Bianchi had died by
poison, or otherwise. He stated more fully
than he had done before, the reasons, which
must render the opinion of any medical
person, on this subject, doubtful. But, whe∣ther
it was that he feared to be responsible
for a decision, which would accuse some
person of murder, or that he really was in∣clined
to believe that Bianchi died naturally,
it is certain he seemed disposed to adopt the
latter opinion; and that he was very
anxious to quiet the suspicions of Vivaldi.
He so far succeeded, indeed, as to convince
him that it would be unavailing to pursue
the enquiry, and almost compelled him to
<PB N="137" REF="148"/>
believe, that she had departed according to
the common course of nature.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, having lingered awhile over the
death-bed of Bianchi, and taken a last fare∣wel
of her silent form, quitted the chamber
and the house as softly as he had approach∣ed,
and unobserved, as he believed, by
Ellena or any other person. The morning
dawned over the sea, when he returned into
the garden, and a few fishermen, loitering
on the beach, or putting off their little boats
from the shore, were the only persons visible
at this early hour. The time, however,
was passed for renewing the enquiry he had
purposed at Paluzzi, and the brightening
dawn warned him to retire. To Naples,
therefore, he returned, with spirits some∣what
soothed by a hope, that Bianchi had
not fallen prematurely, and by the certainty
that Ellena was well. On the way thither,
he passed the fort without interruption, and,
having parted with the physician, was ad∣mitted
into his father's mansion by a con∣fidential
servant.</P>

<L>Some six or seven, who did hide their faces</L>

<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>ELLENA, on thus suddenly losing her
aunt, her only relative, the friend of her
whole life, felt as if left alone in the world.
But it was not in the first moments of af∣fliction
that this feeling occurred. Her
own forlorn situation was not even observed,
while affection, pity, and irresistible grief
for Bianchi, occupied her heart.</P>
<P>Bianchi was to be interred in the church
belonging to the convent of Santa Maria
della Pieta. The body, attired according
to the custom of the country, and decorated
with flowers, was carried on an open bier
to the place of interment, attended only by
priests and torch-bearers. But Ellena could
not endure thus lightly to part with the re∣liques
<PB N="139" REF="150"/>
of a beloved friend, and being restrained
by custom from following the corpse to the
grave, she repaired first to the convent, to
attend the funeral service. Her sorrow did
not allow her to join in the choral sympho∣nies
of the nuns, but their sacred solemnity
was soothing to her spirits, and the tears she
shed while she listened to the lengthening
notes, assuaged the force, of grief.</P>
<P>When the service concluded, she with∣drew
to the parlour of the lady Abbess,
who mingled with her consolations many
entreaties that Ellena would make the con∣vent
her present asylum; and her affliction
required little persuasion on this subject. It
was her wish to retire hither as to a sanc∣tuary
which was not only suitable to her
particular circumstances, but especially
adapted to the present state of her spirits.
Here she believed that she should sooner ac∣quire
resignation, and regain tranquillity,
than in a place less consecrated to religion;
and, before she took leave of the Abbess,
it was agreed, that she, should be received
<PB N="140" REF="151"/>
as a boarder. To acquaint Vivaldi with her
intention was, indeed, her chief motive for
returning to the villa Altieri, after this her re∣solution
had been taken. Her affection and
esteem had been gradual in their progress,
and had now attained a degree of strength,
which promised to decide the happiness or
misery of her whole life. The sanction
given by her aunt to this choice, and parti∣cularly
the very solemn manner in which,
on the evening preceding her death, she be∣queathed
Ellena to his care, had still en∣deared
him to her heart, and imparted a
sacredness to the engagement, which made
her consider Vivaldi as her guardian and
only surviving protector. The more ten∣derly
she lamented her deceased relative, the
more tenderly she thought of Vivaldi; and
her love for the one was so intimately con∣nected
with her affection for the other, that
each seemed strengthened and exalted by
the union.</P>
<P>When the funeral was over, they met at
Altieri.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="152"/>
He was neither surprized or averse to her
withdrawing awhile to a convent; for there
was a propriety in retiring, during the pe∣riod
of her grief, from a home where she
had no longer a guardian, which delicacy
seemed to demand. He only stipulated,
that he might be permitted to visit her in
the parlour of the convent, and to claim,
when decorum should no longer object to it,
the hand, which Bianchi had resigned to
him.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding that he yielded to this
arrangement without complaining, it was
not entirely without repining; but being
assured by Ellena of the worthiness of the
Abbess of the Santa Maria della Pieta, he
endeavoured to silence the secret murmurs
of his heart with the conviction of his
judgment.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the deep impression made by
his unknown tormentor, the monk, and
especially by his prediction of the death of
Bianchi, remained upon his mind, and he
once more determined to ascertain, if pos∣sible,
<PB N="142" REF="153"/>
the true nature of this portentous visit∣ant,
and what were the motives which induced
him thus to haunt his footsteps and interrupt
his peace. He was awed by the circumstances,
which had attended the visitations of the
monk, if monk it was; by the suddenness
of his appearance, and departure; by the
truth of his prophecies; and, above all,
by the solemn event which had verified his
last warning; and his imagination, thus ele∣vated
by wonder and painful curiosity, was
prepared for something above the reach of
common conjecture, and beyond the ac∣complishment
of human agency. His un∣derstanding
was sufficiently clear and strong
to teach him to detect many errors of
opinion, that prevailed around him, as well
as to despise the common superstitions, of his
country, and, in the usual state of his mind,
he probably would not have paused for a
moment on the subject before him; but his
passions were now interested and his fancy
awakened, and, though he was unconscious
of this propensity, he would, perhaps, have
<PB N="143" REF="154"/>
been somewhat disappointed to have de∣scended
suddenly from the region of fearful
sublimity, to which he had soared—the world
of terrible shadows—to the earth, on which
he daily walked, and to an explanation
simply natural.</P>
<P>He designed to visit again, at midnight,
the fortress of Paluzzi, and not to watch
for the appearance of the stranger, but to
carry torches into every recess of the ruin,
and discover, at least, whether it was haunt∣ed
by other human beings than himself.
The chief difficulty, which had hitherto de∣layed
him, was that of finding a person, in
whom he could confide, to accompany him
in the search, since his former, adventure
had warned him never to renew it alone.
Signor Bonarmo persisted absolutely, and,
perhaps, wisely, to refuse his request on this
subject; and, as Vivaldi had no other ac∣quaintance,
to whom he chose to give so
much explanation of the affair as might in∣duce
compliance, he at length determined
to take with him Paulo, his own servant.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="155"/>
On the evening, previous to the day of
Ellena's departure to the Santa della Pieta,
Vivaldi went to Altieri, to bid her adieu.
During this interview his spirits were more
than usually depressed; and, though he
knew that her retirement was only for a
short period, and had as much confidence in
the continuance of her affection, as is, per∣haps,
possible to a lover, Vivaldi felt as if he
was parting with her for ever. A thousand
vague and fearful conjectures, such as he
had never till this moment admitted, as∣sailed
him, and amongst them, it appeared
probable, that the arts of the nuns might
win her from the world, and sacrifice her to
the cloister. In her present state of forrow
this seemed to be even more than probable,
and not all the assurances which Ellena gave
him, and in these parting moments she spoke
with less reserve than she had hitherto done,
could entirely re-assure his mind. “It
should seem Ellena, by these boding fears,”
said he, imprudently, “that I am parting
with you for ever; I feel a weight upon
<PB N="145" REF="156"/>
my heart, which I cannot throw off. Yet
I consent that you shall withdraw awhile to
this convent, convinced of the propriety of
the step; and I ought, also, to know that
you will soon return; that I shall soon take
you from its walls as my wife, never more
to leave me, never more to pass from my
immediate care and tenderness. I ought to
feel assured of all this; yet so apt are my
fears that I cannot confide in what is pro∣bable,
but rather apprehend what is possible.
And is it then possible that I yet may lose
you; and is it only probable that you may
be mine for ever? How, under such cir∣cumstances,
could I weakly consent to your
retirement? Why did I not urge you to
bestow immediately those indissoluble bands,
which no human force can burst asunder?
How could I leave the destiny of all my
peace within the reach of a possibility, which
it was once in my power to have removed!
Which it <HI>was</HI> in my power!—It is, per∣haps,
still in my power. O Ellena! let the
severities of custom yield to the security of
<PB N="146" REF="157"/>
my happiness. If you do go to the Santa
Maria, let it be only to visit its altar!”</P>
<P>Vivaldi delivered this expostulation with a
rapidity, that left no pause for Ellena to in∣terrupt
him. When, at length, he con∣cluded,
she gently reproached him for
doubting the continuance of her regard, and
endeavoured to sooth his apprehensions of
misfortune, but would not listen to his re∣quest.
She represented, that not only the
state of her spirits required retirement, but
that respect to the memory of her aunt de∣manded
it; and added gravely, that if he
had so little confidence in the steadiness of
her opinions, as to doubt the constancy of
her affection, and for so short a period, un∣less
her vows were secured to him, he had
done imprudently to elect her for the com∣panion
of his whole life.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, then ashamed of the weakness he
had betrayed, besought her forgiveness, and
endeavoured to appease apprehensions which
passion only made plausible, and which rea∣son
reproved; notwithstanding which, he
<PB N="147" REF="158"/>
could recover neither tranquillity nor con∣fidence;
nor could Ellena, though her
conduct was supported and encouraged by
justness of sentiment, entirely remove the
oppression of spirits she had felt from almost
the first moment of this interview. They
parted with many tears; and Vivaldi, before
he finally took his leave, frequently return∣ed
to claim some promise, or to ascertain
some explanation, till Ellena remarked with
a forced smile, that these resembled eternal
adieus, rather than those of only a few days;
an observation which renewed all his alarm,
and furnished an excuse for again delaying
his departure. At length he tore himself
away, and left the villa Altieri; but as the
time was yet too early to suit his purposed
enquiry at Paluzzi, he returned to Naples.</P>
<P>Ellena, meanwhile, endeavouring to dissipate
melancholy recollections by employ∣ment,
continued busied in preparation for
her departure on the following day, till a
late hour of the night. In the prospect of
quitting, though only for so short a period,
<PB N="148" REF="159"/>
the home where she had passed almost every
day since the dawn of her earliest remem∣brance,
there was something melancholy,
if not solemn. In leaving these well-known
scenes, where, it might be said, the shade
of her deceased relative seemed yet to linger,
she was quitting all vestige of her late hap∣piness,
all note of former years and of pre∣sent
consolation; and she felt as if going
forth into a new and homeless world. Her
affection for the place encreased as the pass∣ing
time diminished, and it seemed as if the
last moment of her stay would be precisely
that, in which the villa Altieri would be
most valued.</P>
<P>In her favourite apartments she lingered
for a considerable time; and in the room
where she had supped on the night imme∣diately
preceding the death of Signora
Bianchi, she indulged many tender and
mournful recollections, and probably would
have continued to indulge them much
longer, had not her attention been with∣drawn
by a sudden rustling of the foliage
<PB N="149" REF="160"/>
that surrounded the window, when, on
raising her eyes, she thought she perceived
some person pass quickly from before it.
The lattices had, as usual, been left open to
admit the fresh breeze from the bay below,
but she now rose with some alarm to close
them, and had scarcely done so when she
heard a distant knocking from the portico,
and in the next instant the screams of
Beatrice in the hall.</P>
<P>Alarmed for herself, Ellena had, however,
the courage to advance to the assistance of
her old servant, when, on entering the pas∣sage
leading to the hall, three men, masked
and muffled up in cloaks, appeared, ad∣vancing
from the opposite extremity. While
she fled, they pursued her to the apartment
she had quitted. Her breath and her cou∣rage
were gone, yet she struggled to sustain
herself, and endeavoured to ask with calm∣ness
what was their errand. They gave no
reply, but threw a veil over her face, and,
seizing her arms, led her almost unresisting,
but supplicating, towards the portico.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="161"/>
In the hall, Ellena perceived Beatrice
bound to a pillar; and another ruffian, who
was also masked, watching over and me∣nacing
her, not by words, but gestures.
Ellena's shrieks seemed to recall the almost
lifeless Beatrice, for whom she supplicated
as much as for herself; but entreaty was
alike unavailing for each, and Ellena was
borne from the house and through the gar∣den.
All consciousness had now forsaken
her. On recovering, she perceived herself
in a carriage, which was driven with great
rapidity, and that her arms were within the
grasp of some persons, whom, when her
recollection returned more fully, she be∣lieved
to be the men, who had carried her
from the villa. The darkness prevented her
from observing their figures, and to all her
questions and entreaties a death-like silence
was observed.</P>
<P>During the whole night the carriage pro∣ceeded
rapidly, stopping only while the
horses were changed, when Ellena endea∣voured
to interest by her cries the com∣passion
<PB N="151" REF="162"/>
of the people at the post-houses, and
by her cries only, for the blinds were closely
drawn. The postilions, no doubt, imposed
on the credulity of these people, for they
were insensible to her distress, and her im∣mediate
companions soon overcame the only
means that had remained by which she
could make it known.</P>
<P>For the first hours, a tumult of terror
and amazement occupied her mind, but, as
this began to subside, and her understand∣ing
to recover its clearness, grief and de∣spondency
mingled with her fears. She
saw. herself separated from Vivaldi, probably
for ever, for she apprehended that the
strong and invisible hand which governed
her course, would never relinquish its grasp
till it had placed her irrecoverably beyond
the reach of her lover. A conviction that
she should see him no more came, at inter∣vals,
with such overwhelming force, that
every other consideration and emotion dis∣appeared
before it; and at these moments
she lost all anxiety as to the place of her
<PB N="152" REF="163"/>
destination, and all fear as to her personal
safety.</P>
<P>As the morning advanced and the heat
encreased, the blinds were let down a little
to admit air, and Ellena then perceived,
that only two of the men, who had appeared
at the villa Altieri, were in the carriage, and
that they were still disguised in cloaks and
visors. She had no means of judging
through what part of the country she was
travelling, for above the small openings
which the blinds left she could see only the
towering tops of mountains, or sometimes
the veiny precipices and tangled thickets,
that closely impended over the road.</P>
<P>About noon, as she judged from the ex∣cessive
heat, the carriage stopped at a post∣house,
and ice-water was handed through
the window, when, as the blind was lower∣ed
to admit it, she perceived herself on a
wild and solitary plain, surrounded by moun∣tains
and woods. The people at the door
of the post-house seemed “unused to pity
or be pitied.” The lean and fallow coun∣tenance
<PB N="153" REF="164"/>
of poverty stared over their gaunt
bones, and habitual discontent had fixed the
furrows of their cheeks. They regarded
Ellena with only a feeble curiosity, though
the affliction in her looks might have inte∣rested
almost any heart that was not cor∣roded
by its own sufferings; nor did the
masked faces of her companions excite a
much stronger attention.</P>
<P>Ellena accepted the cool refreshment of∣fered
her, the first she had taken on the
road. Her companions having emptied
their glasses drew up the blind, and, not∣withstanding
the almost intolerable heat of
noon, the carriage proceeded. Fainting
under its oppression, Ellena entreated that
the windows might be open, when the men,
in compliance with their own necessity ra∣ther
than with her request, lowered the
blinds, and she had a glimpse of the lofty
region of the mountains, but of no object
that could direct her conjecture concerning
where she was. She saw only pinnacles
and vast precipices of various-tinted marbles,
<PB N="154" REF="165"/>
intermingled with scanty vegetation, such
as stunted pinasters, dwarf oak and holly,
which gave dark touches to the many-co∣loured
cliffs, and sometimes stretched in
shadowy masses to the deep vallies, that,
winding into obscurity, seemed to invite
curiosity to explore the scenes beyond.
Below these bold precipices extended the
gloomy region of olive-trees, and lower still
other rocky steeps sunk towards the plains,
bearing terraces crowned with vines, and
where often the artificial soil was propped
by thickets of juniper, pomegranate and
oleander.</P>
<P>Ellena, after having been so long shut in
darkness, and brooding over her own alarm∣ing
circumstances, found temporary, though
feeble, relief in once more looking upon the
face of nature; till, her spirits being gra∣dually
revived and elevated by the grandeur
of the images around her, she said to her∣self,
“If I am condemned to misery, surely
I could endure it with more fortitude in
scenes like these, than amidst the tamer
<PB N="155" REF="166"/>
landscapes of nature! Here, the objects,
seem to impart somewhat of their own force,
their own sublimity, to the soul. It is
scarcely possible to yield to the pressure of
misfortune while we walk, as with the
Deity, amidst his most stupendous works!”</P>
<P>But soon after the idea of Vivaldi glancing
athwart her memory, she melted into tears;
the weakness however was momentary, and
during the rest of the journey she preserved
a strenuous equality of mind.</P>
<P>It was when the heat and the light were de∣clining
that the carriage entered a rocky defile,
which shewed, as through a telescope re∣versed,
distantplains, and mountains opening
beyond, lighted up with all the purple splen∣dor
of the setting sun. Along this deep
and shadowy perspective a river, which was
seen descending among the cliffs of a moun∣tain,
rolled with impetuous force, fretting
and foaming amidst the dark rocks in its
descent, and then flowing in a limpid lapse
to the brink of other precipices, whence
again it fell with thundering strength to the
<PB N="156" REF="167"/>
abyss, throwing its misty clouds of spray
high in the air, and seeming to claim the
sole empire of this solitary wild. Its bed
took up the whole breadth of the chasm,
which some strong convulsion of the earth
seemed to have formed; not leaving space
even for a road along its margin. The
road, therefore, was carried high among
the cliffs, that impended over the river, and
seemed as if suspended in air; while the
gloom and vastness of the precipices, which
towered above and sunk below it, together
with the amazing force and uproar of the
falling waters, combined to render the pass
more terrific than the pencil could describe,
or language can express. Ellena ascended
it, not with indifference but with calmness;
she experienced somewhat of a dreadful
pleasure in looking down upon the irre∣sistible
flood; but this emotion was height∣ened
into awe, when she perceived that the
road led to a slight bridge, which, thrown
across the chasm at an immense height,
united two opposite cliffs, between which
<PB N="157" REF="168"/>
the whole cataract of the river descended.
The bridge, which was defended only by a
slender railing, appeared as if hung amidst
the clouds. Ellena, while she was crossing
it, almost forgot her misfortunes. Having
reached the opposite side of the glen, the
road gradually descended the precipices for
about half a mile, when it opened to ex∣tensive
prospects over plains and towards
distant mountains—the sunshine landscape,
which had long appeared to bound this
shadowy pass. The transition was as the
passage through the vale of death to the
bliss of eternity; but the idea of its resem∣blance
did not long remain with Ellena.
Perched high among the cliffs of a moun∣tain,
which might be said to terminate one
of the jaws of this terrific gorge, and which was
one of the loftiest of a chain that sur∣rounded
the plains, appeared the spires and
long terraces of a monastery; and she soon
understood that her journey was to con∣clude
there.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="169"/>
At the foot of this mountain her compa∣nions
alighted, and obliged her to do the
same, for the ascent was too steep and irre∣gular
to admit of a carriage. Ellena fol∣lowed
unresistingly, like a lamb to the sa∣crifice,
up a path that wound among the
rocks, and was cooly overshadowed by
thickets of almond trees, figs, broad-leaved
myrtle, and ever-green rose bushes, inter∣mingled
with the strawberry tree, beautiful
in fruit and blossoms, the yellow jasmine,
the delightful <HI>acacia mimosa,</HI> and a variety
of other fragrant plants. Those bowers
frequently admitted glimpses of the glowing
country below, and sometimes opened to
expansive views bounded by the snowy
mountains of Abruzzo. At every step
were objects which would have afforded
pleasure to a tranquil mind; the beautifully
variegated marbles, that formed the cliffs
immediately above, their fractured masses
embossed with mosses and flowers of every
vivid hue that paints the rainbow; the ele∣gance
of the shrubs that tufted, and the
<PB N="159" REF="170"/>
majestic grace of the palms which waved
over them, would have charmed almost
any oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eye than Ellena's, whose spirit
was wrapt in care, or than those of her
companions, whose hearts were dead to
feeling. Partial features of the vast edifice
she was approaching, appeared now and
then between the trees; the tall west win∣dow
of the cathedral with the spires that
overtopped it; the narrow pointed roofs
of the cloisters; angles of the insurmount∣able
walls, which fenced the garden from,
the precipices below, and the dark portal
leading into the chief court; each of these,
seen at intervals beneath the gloom of
cypress and spreading cedar, seemed as if
menacing the unhappy Ellena with hints
of future suffering. She passed several
shrines and images half hid among the
shrubs and the cliffs; and, when she drew
near the monastery, her companions stopped
at a little chapel which stood beside the path,
where, after examining some papers, an act
<PB N="160" REF="171"/>
which she observed with surprise, they drew
aside, as if to consult respecting herself.
Their conversation was delivered in voices
so low, that she could not catch a single
tone distinctly, and it is probable that if she
could, this would not have assisted her in con∣jecturing
who they were; yet the profound
silence they had hitherto observed had
much encreased her curiosity, now that
they spoke.</P>
<P>One of them soon after quitted the chapel
and proceeded alone to the monastery, leav∣ing
Ellena in the custody of his comrade,
whose pity she now made a last, though
almost hopeless, effort to interest. He re∣plied
to all her entreaties only by a waving
of the hand, and an averted face; and she
endeavoured to meet with fortitude and to
endure with patience, the evil which she
could neither avoid nor subdue. The spot
where she awaited the return of the ruffian,
was not of a character to promote melan∣choly,
except, indeed, that luxurious and
solemn kind of melancholy, which a view
<PB N="161" REF="172"/>
of stupendous objects inspires. It over∣looked
the whole extent of plains, of which
she had before caught partial scenes, with
the vast chain of mountains, which seemed
to form an insurmountable rampart to the
rich landscape at their feet. Their towering
and fantastic summits, crowding together
into dusky air, like flames tapering to a
point, exhibited images of peculiar gran∣deur,
while each minuter line and feature
withdrawing, at this evening hour from ob∣servation,
seemed to resolve itself into the
more gigantic masses, to which the dubious
tint, the solemn obscurity, that began to
prevail over them, gave force and loftier
character. The silence and deep repose
of the landscape, served to impress this
character more awfully on the heart, and
while Ellena sat wrapt in the thoughtful∣ness
it promoted, the vesper-service of the
monks breathing softly from the cathedral
above, came to her ear; it was a music
which might be said to win on silence, and
was in perfect unison with her feelings;
<PB N="162" REF="173"/>
solemn, deep, and full, it swelled, in holy
peels, and rolled away in murmurs, which
attention pursued to the last faint note that
melted into air. Ellena's heart owned the
power of this high minstrelsy; and while she
caught for a moment the sweeter voices of
the nuns mingling in the chorus, she in∣dulged
a hope that they would not be
wholly insensible to her sufferings, and that
she should receive some consolation from
sympathy as soft as these tender-breathing
strains appeared to indicate.</P>
<P>She had rested nearly half an hour on
the turfy slope before the chapel, when she
perceived through the twilight, two monks
descending from the monastery towards the
spot where she sat. As they drew near,
she distinguished their dress of grey stuff,
the hood, the shaven head, where only a
coronet of white hair was left, and other
ensigns of their particular order. On reach∣ing
the chapel they accosted her compani∣on,
with whom they retired a few paces,
and conversed. Ellena heard, for the first
<PB N="163" REF="174"/>
time, the sound of her conductor's voice,
and though this was but faintly, she mark∣ed
it well. The other ruffian did not yet
appear, but it seemed evident that these
friars had left the convent in consequence
of his information; and sometimes, when
she looked upon the taller of the two, she
fancied she saw the person of the very man
whose absence she had remarked, a con∣jecture
which strengthened while she more
accurately noticed him. The portrait had
certainly much resemblance in height and
bulk; and the same gaunt awkwardness,
which even the cloak of the ruffian had
not entirely shrouded, obtruded itself from
under the folded garments of the recluse.
If countenance, too, might be trusted, this
same friar had a ruffian's heart, and his
keen and cunning eye seemed habitually
upon the watch for prey. His brother of
the order shewed nothing strongly charac∣teristic
either in his face or manner.</P>
<P>After a private conversation of some
length, the friars approached Ellena, and
<PB N="164" REF="175"/>
told her, that she must accompany them to
the convent; when her disguised conduct∣or,
having resigned her to them, immediate∣ly
departed and descended the mountain.</P>
<P>Not a word was uttered by either of the
party as they pursued the steep tract lead∣ing
to the gates of this secluded edifice,
which were opened to them by a lay-bro∣ther,
and Ellena entered a spacious court.
Three sides of this were enclosed by lofty
buildings, lined with ranges of cloisters;
the fourth opened to a garden, shaded with
avenues of melancholy cypress, that extend∣ed
to the cathedral, whose fretted windows
and ornamented spires appeared to close
the perspective. Other large and detached
buildings skirted the gardens on the left,
while, on the right, spacious olive-grounds
and vineyards spread to the cliffs that form∣ed
a barrier to all this side of the domain of
the convent.</P>
<P>The friar, her conductor, crossed the
court to the north wing, and there ringing
a bell, a door was opened by a nun, into
<PB N="165" REF="176"/>
whose hands Ellena was given. A signi∣ficant
look was exchanged between the de∣votees,
but no words; the friar departed,
and the nun, still silent, conducted her
through many solitary passages, where not
even a distant foot-fall echoed, and whose
walls were roughly painted with subjects
indicatory of the severe superstitions of the
place, tending to inspire melancholy awe.
Ellena's hope of pity vanished as her eyes
glanced over these symbols of the disposition
of the inhabitants, and on the countenance
of the nun characterised by a gloomy ma∣lignity,
which seemed ready to inflict upon
others some portion of the unhappiness she
herself suffered. As she glided forward
with soundless step, her white drapery, float∣ing
along these solemn avenues, and her
hollow features touched with the mingled
light and shadow which the partial rays of
a taper she held occasioned, she seemed like
a spectre newly risen from the grave, rather
than a living being. These passages termi∣nated
in the parlour of the Abbess, where
<PB N="166" REF="177"/>
the nun paused, and, turning to Ellena,
said, “It is the hour of vespers; you will
wait here till our lady of the convent leaves
the church; she would speak with you.”</P>
<P>“To what saint is the convent dedicat∣ed,”
said Ellena, “and who, sister, presides
over it?”</P>
<P>The nun gave no reply, and after
having eyed the forlorn stranger for a
moment, with inquisitive ill-nature, quitted
the room. The unhappy Ellena had not
been left long to her own reflections, when
the Abbess appeared; a stately lady, appa∣rently
occupied with opinions of her own
importance, and prepared to receive her
guest with rigour and supercilious haughti∣ness.
This Abbess, who was herself a
woman of some distinction, believed that of
all possible crimes, next to that of sacrilege,
offences against persons of rank were least
pardonable. It is not surprising, therefore,
that, supposing Ellena, a young woman of no
family, to have sought clandestinely to unite
herself with the noble house of Vivaldi, she
<PB N="167" REF="178"/>
should feel for her, not only disdain, but
indignation, and that she should readily
consent, not only to punish the offender,
but at the same time, to afford means
of preserving the ancient dignity of the
offended.</P>
<P>“I understand,” said the Abbess, on
whose appearance the alarmed Ellena had
arisen, “I understand,” said she, without
making any signal for her to be seated,
“that you are the young person who is
arrived from Naples.”</P>
<P>“My name is Ellena di Rosalba,” said
her auditor, recovering some degree of
courage from the manner which was de∣signed
to depress her.</P>
<P>“I know nothing of your name,” re∣plied
the Superior; “I am informed only
that you are sent here to acquire a know∣ledge
of yourself and of your duties. Till
the period shall be passed, for which you
are given into my charge, I shall scrupulously
observe the obligations of the troublesome
office, which my regard for the honour of
<PB N="168" REF="179"/>
a noble family, has induced me to under∣take.”</P>
<P>By these words, the author and the mo∣tives
of this extraordinary transaction were
at once revealed to Ellena, who was for some
moments almost overwhelmed by the sud∣den
horrors that gathered on her mind, and
stood silent and motionless. Fear, shame,
and indignation, alternately assailed her;
and the sting of offended honour, on being
suspected, and thus accused of having volun∣tarily
disturbed the tranquillity, and sought
the alliance of any family, and especially of
one who disdained her, struck forcibly to
her heart, till the pride of conscious worth
revived her courage and fortified her pa∣tience,
and she demanded by whose will
she had been torn from her home, and by
whose authority she was now detained, as
it appeared, a prisoner.</P>
<P>The Abbess, unaccustomed to have her
power opposed, or her words questioned,
was for a moment too indignant to reply;
and Ellena observed, but no longer with
<PB N="169" REF="180"/>
dismay, the brooding tempest ready to burst
over her head, “It is I only, who am in∣jured,”
said she to herself, “and shall the
guilty oppressor triumph, and the innocent
sufferer sink under the shame that belongs
only to guilt! Never will I yield to a weak∣ness
so contemptible. The consciousness
of deserving well will recall my presence
of mind, which, permitting me to estimate
the characters of my oppressors by their
actions, will enable me also to despise their
power.”</P>
<P>“I must remind you,” said the Abbess,
at length, “that the questions you make
are unbecoming in your situation; and
that contrition and humility are the best
extenuations of error. You may with∣draw.”</P>
<P>“Most true” replied Ellena, bowing
with dignity to the Superior; “and I most
willingly resign them to my oppressors.”</P>
<P>Ellena forbore to make further enquiry
or remonstrance, and perceiving that re∣proach
would not only be useless, but de∣grading
<PB N="170" REF="181"/>
to herself, she immediately obeyed
the mandate of the Abbess, and determin∣ed,
since she must suffer, to suffer, if pos∣sible,
with firmness and dignity.</P>
<P>She was conducted from the parlour by
the nun who had admitted her, and as she
passed through the refectory where the
nuns, just returned from vespers, were
assembled, their inquisitive glances, their
smiles and busy whispers, told her, that she
was not only an object of curiosity, but of
suspicion, and that little sympathy could be
expected from hearts, which even the offices
of hourly devotion had not purified from
the malignant envy, that taught them to
exalt themselves upon the humiliation of
others.</P>
<P>The little room, to which Ellena was led,
and where, to her great satisfaction, she
was left alone, rather deserved the deno∣mination
of a cell than of a chamber;
since like those of the nuns, it had only
one small lattice; and a mattress, one chair,
and a table, with a crucifix and a prayer∣book
<PB N="171" REF="182"/>
were all its furniture. Ellena, as
she surveyed her melancholy habitation,
suppressed a rising sigh, but she could not
remain unaffected by recollections, which,
on this view of her altered state, crowded
to her mind; nor think of Vivaldi far away,
perhaps for ever, and probably, even igno∣rant
of her destination, without bitter tears.
But she dried them, as the idea of the Mar∣chesa
obtruded on her thoughts, for other
emotions than those of grief possessed her.
It was to the Marchesa that she especially
attributed her present situation; and it now
appeared, that the family of Vivaldi had
not only been reluctant, but absolutely
averse to a connection with hers, contrary
to the suggestions of Signora Bianchi, who
had represented, that it might be supposed
only, from their known character, that they
would disapprove of the alliance, but would
of course be reconciled to an event, which
their haughtiest displeasure never could re∣voke.
This discovery of their absolute re∣jection
awakened all the proper pride,
<PB N="172" REF="183"/>
which the mistaken prudence of her aunt,
and her affection for Vivaldi had lulled to
rest; and she now suffered the most acute
vexation and remorse, for having yielded
her consent to enter clandestinely into any
family. The imaginary honours of so noble
an alliance vanished, when the terms of
obtaining them were considered; and now,
that the sound mind of Ellena was left to
its own judgment, she looked with infinitely
more pride and preference upon the indus∣trious
means, which had hitherto rendered
her independent, than on all distinction
which might be relunctantly conferred.
The consciousness of innocence, which had
supported her in the presence of the Supe∣rior,
began to falter. “Her accusation
was partly just!” said Ellena, “and I de∣serve
punishment, since I could, even for a
moment, submit to the humiliation of de∣siring
an alliance, which I knew would be
unwillingly conferred. But it is not yet
too late to retrieve my own esteem by as∣serting
my independence, and resigning Vi∣valdi
<PB N="173" REF="184"/>
for ever. By resigning him! by
abandoning him who loves me,—abandon∣ing
him to misery! “Him, whom I cannot
even think of without tears,—to whom my
vows: have been given,—who may claim
me by the sacred remembrance of my dying
friend,—him, to whom my whole heart is
devoted! O! miserable alternative!—that
I can no longer act justly, but at the ex∣pence
of all my future happiness! Justly!
And Would it then be just to abandon him
who is willing to resign every thing for
me,—abandon him to ceaseless sorrow, that
the prejudices of his family may be grati∣fied?”</P>
<P>Poor Ellena perceived that me could not
obey the dictates of a just pride, without
such opposition from her heart as she had
never experienced before. Her affections
were now too deeply engaged to permit her
to act with firmness, at the price of long-suffering.
The consideration of resigning
Vivaldi was so very grievous, that she could
scarcely endure to pause upon it for a mo∣ment;
<PB N="174" REF="185"/>
yet, on the other hand, when she
thought of his family, it appeared that she
never could consent to make a part of it.
She would have blamed the erroneous
judgment of Signora Bianchi, whose per∣suasions
had so much assisted in reducing
her to the present alternative, had not the
tenderness with which she cherished her
memory, rendered this impossible. All,
that now remained for her, was to endea∣vour
patiently to endure present evils, which
she could not conquer; for, to forsake
Vivaldi as the price of liberty, should liberty
be offered her on such terms, or to accept
him in defiance of honourable pride, should
he ever effect her release, appeared to her
distracted thoughts almost equally, imprac∣ticable.
But, as the probability of his never
being able to discover her abode, returned
to her consideration, the anguish she suffer∣ed
told how much more she dreaded to lose
than to accept Vivaldi, and that love was,
after all, the most powerful affection of her heart.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<Q>“The bell then beating one!”
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>VIVALDI, meanwhile, ignorant of what
had occurred at villa Altieri, repaired as he
had proposed, to Paluzzi, attended by his
servant Paulo. It was deep night before he
left Naples, and so anxious was he to con∣ceal
himself from observation, that though
Paulo carried a torch, he did not permit it
to be lighted, till after he should have re∣mained
some time within the arch-way,
thinking it most prudent to watch a while
in secret for his unknown adviser, before
he proceeded to examine the fort.</P>
<P>His attendant, Paulo, was a true Nea∣politan,
shrewd, inquisitive, insinuating,
adroit; possessing much of the spirit of in∣trigue,
together with a considerable portion
of humour, which displayed itself not so
<PB N="176" REF="187"/>
much in words, as in his manner and coun∣tenance,
in the archness of his dark, pene∣trating
eye, and in the exquisite adaptation
of his gesture to his idea. He was a distin∣guished
favourite with his master, who, if
he had not humour himself, had a keen re∣lish
of it in others, and who certainly did
possess wit, with all its lively accompani∣ments,
in an eminent degree. Vivaldi had
been won by the <HI>naïvete</HI> and humour of
this man, to allow him an unusual degree
of familiarity in convention; and, as they
now walked together towards Paluzzi, he
unfolded to Paulo as much of his former
adventure there as he judged necessary to
interest his curiosity and excite his vigi∣lance.
The relation did both. Paulo,
however, naturally courageous, was in∣credulous
to superstition of any kind; and,
having quickly perceived that his master
was not altogether indisposed to attribute
to a supernatural cause the extraordinary
occurrences at Paluzzi, he began, in his
manner, to rally him; but Vivaldi was not
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>
in temper to endure jesting; his mood was
grave, even to solemnity, and he yielded,
though reluctantly, to the awe which, at
intervals, returned upon him with the force
of a magical spell, binding up all his facul∣ties
to sternness, and fixing them in expecta∣tion.
While he was nearly regardless of
defence against human agency, his servant
was, however, preparing for that alone;
and very properly represented the impru∣dence
of going to Paluzzi in darkness.
Vivaldi observed that they could not watch
for the monk otherwise than in darkness,
since the torch which lighted them would
also warn him, and he had very particular
reasons for watching before he proceeded
to examine. He added, that after a certain
time had elapsed, the torch might be lighted
at a neighbouring cottage. Paulo objected,
that in the meanwhile, the person for whom
they watched might escape; and Vivaldi com∣promised
the affair. The torch was lighted,
but concealed within a hallow of the cliffs,
that bordered the road, and the centinels
<PB N="178" REF="189"/>
took their station in darkness, within the
deep arch, near the spot where Vivaldi had
watched with Bonarmo. As they did this,
the distant chime of a convent informed
Vivaldi that midnight was turned. The
sound recalled to his mind the words of
Schedoni, concerning the vicinity of the
convent of the <HI>Black Penitents,</HI> to Paluzzi,
and he asked Paulo whether this was the
chime of that convent. Paulo replied that
it was, and that a remarkable circumstance
had taught him to remember <HI>the Santa del
Pianto, or Our Lady of Tears.</HI> “The
place, Signor, would interest you,” said
Paulo; “for there are some odd stories told
of it; and I am inclined to think, this un∣known
monk must be one of that society,
his conduct is so strange.”</P>
<P>“You believe then, that I am willing to
give faith to wonderful stories,” said Vi∣valdi,
smiling. “But what have you heard,
that is so extraordinary, respecting this con∣vent?
Speak low, or we may be dis∣covered.”</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="190"/>
“Why, Signor, the story is not gene∣rally
known,” said Paulo in a whisper;
“I half promised never to reveal it.”</P>
<P>“If you are under any promise of se∣cresy,”
interrupted Vivaldi, “I forbid you
to tell this wonderful tale, which, however,
seems somewhat too big to rest within your
brain.”</P>
<P>“The story would fain expand itself to
your's, Signor,” said Paulo; “and, as I
did not absolutely promise to conceal it,
I am very willing to reveal it.”</P>
<P>“Proceed, then,” said Vivaldi; “but
let me once more caution you to speak
low.”</P>
<P>“You are obeyed, Signor. You must
know, then, <HI>Maestro,</HI> that it was on the eve
of the festival of <HI>Santo Marco,</HI> and about
six years since”—</P>
<P>“Peace!” said Vivaldi. They were si∣lent;
but every thing remaining still, Paulo,
aster some time, ventured to proceed, though
in a yet lower whisper. “It was on the eve
of the <HI>Santo Marco,</HI> and when the last bell
<PB N="180" REF="191"/>
had rung, that a person”—He stopped
again, for a rustling sound passed near him.</P>
<P>“You are too late,” said a sudden voice
beside Vivaldi, who instantly recognized the
thrilling accents of the monk.—“It is past
midnight; she departed an hour ago. Look
to your steps!”.</P>
<P>Though thrilled by this well-known
voice, Vivaldi scarcely yielded to his feel∣ings
for a moment, but, checking the ques∣tion
which would have asked “who de∣parted?”
he, by a sudden spring, endea∣voured
to seize the intruder, while Paulo, in
the first hurry of his alarm, fired a pistol, and
then hastened for the torch. So certainly did
Vivaldi believe himself to have leaped upon
the spot whence the voice proceeded, that, on
reaching it, he instantly extended his arms,
and searching around, expected every mo∣ment
to find his enemy in his grasp. Dark∣ness
again baffled his attempt.</P>
<P>“You are known,” cried Vivaldi;
“you shall see me at the <HI>Santa dell
Pianto!</HI> What, oh! Paulo, the torch!—The
torch!”</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="192"/>
Paulo, swift as the wind, appeared with
it. “He passed up those steps in the rock,
Signor; I saw the skirts of his garments
ascending!”</P>
<P>“Follow me, then,” said Vivaldi,
mounting the steps. “Away, away,
<HI>Maestro!”</HI> said Paulo, impatiently; “but,
for Heaven's sake, name no more the con∣vent
of the <HI>Santa dell Pianto;</HI> our lives
may answer it!”</P>
<P>He followed to the terrace above, where
Vivaldi, holding high the torch, looked
round for the monk. The place, however,
as far as his eye could penetrate, was for∣saken
and silent. The glare of the torch,
enlightened only the rude walls of the cita∣del,
some points of the cliff below, and some
tall pines that waved over them, leaving in
doubtful gloom many a recess of the ruin,
and many a tangled thicket, that spread
among the rocks beyond.</P>
<P>“Do you perceive any person, Paulo?”
said Vivaldi, waving the torch in the air to
rouse the flame.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="193"/>
“Among those arches on the left,
Signor, those arches that stand duskily
beyond the citadel, I thought I saw a sha∣dowy
sort of a figure pass. He might be a
ghost, by his silence, for aught I know,
<HI>Maestro;</HI> but he seems to have a good
mortal instinct in taking care of himself,
and to have as swift a pair of heels to assist
in carrying him off, as any Lazaro in Naples
need desire.”</P>
<P>“Fewer words, and more caution!”
said Vivaldi, lowering the torch, and point∣ing
it towards the quarter which Paulo had
mentioned. “Be vigilant, and tread light∣ly.”</P>
<P>“You are obeyed, Signor; but their
eyes will inform them, though their ears
refuse, while we hold a light to our own
steps.”</P>
<P>“Peace, with this buffoonery∣” said
Vivaldi, somewhat sternly; “follow in si∣lence,
and be on your guard.”</P>
<P>Paulo submitted, and they proceeded to∣wards
the range of arches, which commu∣nicated
<PB N="183" REF="194"/>
with the building, whose si <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gular
structure had formerly arrested the atten∣tion
of Bonarmo, and whence Vivaldi him∣self
had returned with such unexpected
precipitancy and consternation.</P>
<P>On perceiving the place he was ap∣proaching,
he suddenly, stopped, and Paulo
observing his agitation, and probably not
relishing the adventure, endeavoured to dis∣suade
him from further research: “For we
know not who may inhabit this gloomy
place, Signor, or their numbers, and we are
only two of us after all! Besides, Signor,
it was through that door, yonder;” and
he pointed to the very spot whence Vivaldi
had so fearfully issued; “through that
door, that I fancied, just now, I saw some∣thing
pass.”</P>
<P>“Are you certain as to this?” said Vi∣valdi,
with increased emotion. “What
was its form?”</P>
<P>“It was so dusky thereabout, <HI>Maestro,</HI>
that I could not distinguish.”</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="195"/>
Vivaldi's eyes were fixed upon the build∣ing,
and a violent conflict of feelings seemed
to shake his soul. A few seconds decided
it. “I will go on,” said he, “and termi∣nate,
at any hazard, this state of intolerable
anxiety. Paulo, pause a moment, and con∣sider
well whether you can depend on
your courage, for it may be severely tried.
If you can, descend with me in silence:, and
I warn you to be wary; if you cannot, I
will go alone.”</P>
<P>“It is too late now, Signor, to ask my∣self
that question,” replied Paulo, with a
submissive air; “and if I had not settled it
long ago, I should not have followed you
thus far. My courage, Signor, you never
doubted before.”</P>
<P>“Come on then,” said Vivaldi. He
drew his sword, and entering the narrow
door-way, the torch, which he had now re∣signed
to Paulo, shewed a stone passage,
that was, however, interminable to the
eye.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="196"/>
“As they proceeded, Paulo observed, that
the walls were stained in several places with,
what appeared, to be blood, but prudently
forbore to point this out to his master, ob∣serving
the strict injunction of silence he had
received.</P>
<P>Vivaldi stepped cautiously, and often
paused to listen, after which he went on
with a quicker pace, making signs only to,
Paulo to follow, and be vigilant. The pas∣sage
terminated in a stair-case, that seemed
to lead to vaults below. Vivaldi remem∣bered
the light which had formerly ap∣peared
there, and, as recollection of the
past gathered on his mind, he faultered in
his purpose.</P>
<P>Again he paused, looked back upon
Paulo, but was going forward, when Paulo
himself seized his arm. “Stop! Signor,”
said he in a low voice. “Do you not dis∣tinguish
a figure standing yonder, in the
gloom.?”</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked onward, and perceived,
indistinctly, something as of human form,
<PB N="186" REF="197"/>
but motionless and silent. It stood at the
dusky extremity of the avenue, near the
stair-case. Its garments, if garments they
were, were dark; but its whole figure was
so faintly traced to the eye, that it was im∣possible
to ascertain whether this was the
monk. Vivaldi took the light, and held it
forward, endeavouring to distinguish the
object before he ventured further; but the
enquiry was useless, and, resigning the torch
to Paulo, he rushed on. When he reached
the head of the stair-case, however, the form,
whatever it might be, was gone. Vivaldi
had heard no footstep. Paulo pointed out
the exact spot where it had stood, but no
vestige of it appeared. Vivaldi called loudly
upon the monk, but he heard only the
lengthening echoes of his own voice revolv∣ing
among the chambers below, and, after
hesitating a while on the head of the stairs,
he descended.</P>
<P>Paulo had not followed down many steps,
when he called out, “It is there! Signor;
<PB N="187" REF="198"/>
I see it again! and now it flits away through
the door that opens to the vaults!”</P>
<P>Vivaldi pursued so swiftly, that Paulo
could scarcely follow fast enough with the
light; and, as at length he rested to take
breath, he perceived himself in the same
spacious chamber to which he had for∣merly
descended. At this moment Paulo
perceived his countenance change. “You
are ill, Signor,” said he. “In the name of
our holy Saint, let us quit this hideous place.
Its inhabitants can be nothing good, and no
good can come of our remaining here.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi made no reply; he drew breath
with difficulty, and his eyes remained fixed
on the ground, till a noise, like the creaking
of a heavy hinge, rose in a distant part of the
vault. Paulo turned his eyes, at the same
instant, towards the place whence it came,
and they both perceived, a door in the wall
slowly opened, and immediately closed again,
as if the person within had feared to be dis∣covered.
Each believed, from the transient
view he had of it, that this was the same
<PB N="188" REF="199"/>
figure which had appeared on the stair-case,
and that it was the monk himself. Re∣animated
by this belief, Vivaldi's nerves
were instantly rebraced, and he sprang to
the door, which was unfastened, and yielded
immediately to his impetuous hand. “You
shall not deceive me now,” cried he, as he
entered; “Paulo! keep guard at the
door!”</P>
<P>He looked round the second vault, in
which he now found himself, but no person
appeared; he examined the place, and par∣ticularly
the walls, without discovering any
aperture, either of door or window, by which
the figure could have quitted the chamber;
a strongly-grated casement, placed near the
roof, was all that admitted air, and probably
light. Vivaldi was astonished! “Have you
seen any thing pass?” said he to Paulo.</P>
<P>“Nothing, <HI>Maestro,</HI> replied the ser∣vant.</P>
<P>“This is almost incredible,” exclaimed
Vivaldi; “`tis certain, this form can be
nothing human!”</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="200"/>
“If so, Signor,” observed Paulo, “why
should it fear us? as surely it does; or why
should it have fled?”</P>
<P>“That is not so certain,” rejoined Vi∣valdi;
“it may have fled only to lead us
into evil. But bring hither the torch; here
is something in the wall which I would exa∣mine.”</P>
<P>Paulo obeyed. It was merely a rugged∣ness
in the stones, not the partition of a
door, that had excited his curiosity. “This
is inexplicable!” exclaimed Vivaldi, after
a long pause. “What motive could any
human being have for thus tormenting
me.”</P>
<P>“Or any being superhuman, either, my
Signor?” said Paulo.</P>
<P>“I am warned of evils that await me,”
continued Vivaldi, musing; “of events
that are regularly fulfilled; the being who
warns me, crosses my path perpetually, yet,
with the cunning of a demon, as constantly
eludes my grasp, and baffles my pursuit!
It is incomprehensible, by what means he
<PB N="190" REF="201"/>
glides thus away from my eye, and fades,
as if into air, at my approach! He is re∣peatedly
in my presence, yet is never to be
found!”</P>
<P>“It is most true, Signor,” said Paulo,
“that he is never to be found, and there∣fore
let me entreat you to give up the pur∣suit.
This place is enough to make one
believe in the horrors of purgatory! Let
us go, Signor.”</P>
<P>“What but spirit could have quitted
this vault so mysteriously,” continued Vi∣valdi,
not attending to Paulo; “what but
spirit!”—</P>
<P>“I would fain prove,” said the servant,
that substance can quit it as easily; I
would fain evaporate through that door
myself.”</P>
<P>He had scarcely spoken the words, when
the door closed, with a thundering clap
that echoed through all the vaults; and
Vivaldi and Paulo stood for a moment
aghast! and then both hastened to open it,
and to leave the place. Their consternation
<PB N="191" REF="202"/>
may be easily conceived, when they found
that all their efforts at the door, were in∣effectual.
The thick wood was inlaid with
solid bars of iron; and was of such un∣conquerable
strength, that it evidently,
guarded what had been designed for a pri∣son,
and appeared to be the keep or dun∣geon
of the ancient fort.</P>
<P>“Ah, Signor mio!” said Paulo, “if this was
a spirit, 'tis plain he knew we were not so,
by his luring us hither. Would we could
exchange natures with him for a moment;
for I know not how, as mere mortal men,
we can ever squeeze ourselves out of this
scrape. You must allow, <HI>Maestro,</HI> that
this was not one of the evils he warned you
of; or, if he did, it was through my or∣gans,
for I entreated you.”—</P>
<P>“Peace, good Signor <HI>Buffo!”</HI> said. Vi∣valdi;
“a truce with this nonsense, and
assist in searching for some means, of
escape.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi again examined the walls, and as
unsuccessfully as before; but in one corner
<PB N="192" REF="203"/>
of the vault lay an object, which seemed to
tell the fate of one who had been confined
here, and to hint his own: it was a gar∣ment
covered with blood. Vivaldi and his
servant discovered it at the same instant;
and a dreadful foreboding of their own de∣stiny
fixed them, for some moments, to the
spot. Vivaldi first recovered himself, when
instead of yielding to despondency, all his
faculties were aroused to devise some means
for escaping; but Paulo's hopes seemed
buried beneath the dreadful vestments upon
which he still gazed. “Ah, my Signor!”
said he, at length, in a faultering accent,
“who shall dare to raise that garment?
What if it should conceal the mangled
body whose blood has stained it!”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, shudderingly, turned to look on
it again.</P>
<P>“It moves?” exclaimed Paulo; “I see
it move!” as he said which, he started to
the opposite side of the chamber. Vivaldi
stepped a few paces back, and as quickly
returned; when, determined to know the
<PB N="193" REF="204"/>
event at once, he raised the, garment upon
the point of his sword, and perceived, be∣neath,
other remains of dress, heaped high
together, while even the floor below was
stained with gore.</P>
<P>Believing that fear had deceived the
eyes of Paulo, Vivaldi watched this hor∣rible
spectacle for some time, but with∣out,
perceiving the least motion; when he
became convinced, that not any remains of
life were shrouded beneath it, and that it
contained only articles of dress, which had
belonged to some unfortunate person, who
had probably been decoyed hither for plun∣der,
and afterwards murdered. This be∣lief,
and the repugnance he felt to dwell
upon the spectacle, prevented him from
examining further, and he turned away to
a remote part of the vault. A conviction of
his own fate, and of his servant's, filled his
mind for a while with despair. It appeared
that he had been ensnared by robbers, till,
as he recollected the circumstances which
had attended his entrance, and the several
<PB N="194" REF="205"/>
peculiar occurrences connected with the
arch-way, this conjecture seemed highly im∣probable.
It was unreasonable, that robbers
should have taken the trouble to decoy, when
they might at first have seized him; still more
so, that they would have persevered so long
in the attempt; and most of all, that when
he had formerly been in their power, they
should have neglected their opportunity, and
suffered him to leave the ruin unmolested.
Yet, granting that all this, improbable as it
was, were, however, possible, the solemn
warnings and predictions of the monk, so
frequently delivered, and so faithfully ful∣filled,
could have no connection with the
schemes of banditti. It appeared, therefore,
that Vivaldi was not in the hands of rob∣bers;
or, if he were, that the monk, at
least, had no connection with them; yet it
was certain that he had just heard the voice
of this monk beneath the arch; that his
servant had said, he saw the vestments of
one ascending the steps of the fort; and
that they had both reason, afterward, to
<PB N="195" REF="206"/>
believe if was his shadowy figure, which
they had pursued to the very chamber
where they were now confined.</P>
<P>As Vivaldi considered all these circum∣stances,
his perplexity encreased, and he
was more than ever inclined to believe, that
the form, which had assumed the appear∣ance
of a monk, was something super∣human.</P>
<P>“If this being had <HI>appeared only,”</HI> said
he to himself, “I should, perhaps, have
thought it the perturbed spirit of him, who
doubtless has been murdered here, and that
it led me hither to discover the deed, that
his bones might be removed to holy ground;
but this monk, or whatever it is, was neither
silent, nor apparently anxious concerning
himself; he spoke only of events connected
with my peace, and predicted of the future,
as well as reverted to the past! If he had
either hinted of himself, or had been wholly
silent, his appearance, and manner of elud∣ing
pursuit, is so extraordinary, that I
should have yielded, for once, perhaps, to
<PB N="194" REF="207"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="195" REF="208"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="196" REF="209"/>
the tales of our grandfathers, and thought
he was the spectre of a murdered person.”</P>
<P>As Vivaldi expressed his incredulity,
however, he returned to examine the gar∣ment
once more, when, as he raised it,
he observed, what had before escaped his
notice, black drapery mingled with the
heap beneath; and, on lifting this also on
the point of his sword, he perceived part of
the habiliment of a monk! He started at
the discovery, as if he had seen the appari∣tion,
which had so long been tempting his
credulity. Here were the vest and scapu∣lary,
rent and stained with blood! Having
gazed for a moment, he let them drop
upon the heap; when Paulo, who had
been silently observing him, exclaimed,</P>
<P>“Signor! that should be the garment of
the demon who led us hither. Is it a wind∣ing-sheet
for us, <HI>Maestro?</HI> Or was it one
for the body he inhabited while on earth!”</P>
<P>“Neither, I trust,” replied Vivaldi, en∣deavouring
to command the perturbation
he suffered, and turning from the spectacle;
<PB N="197" REF="210"/>
“therefore we will try once more to re∣gain
our liberty.”</P>
<P>This was a design, however, beyond his
accomplishment; and, having again attacked
the door, raised Paulo to the grated win∣dow,
and vociferated for release with his
utmost strength, in which he was very ably
seconded by Paulo, he abandoned, for the
present, all further attempts, and, weary
and desponding, threw himself on the ground
of the dungeon.</P>
<P>Paulo bitterly lamented his master's rash∣ness
in penetrating to this remote spot, and
bewailed the probability of their being fa∣mished.</P>
<P>“For, supposing, Signor, that we were
not decoyed hither for plunder and butch∣ery,
and supposing that we are not sur∣rounded
by malicious spirits, which San
Januarius forbid I should take upon me to
affirm is impossible! supposing all this, Sig∣nor,
yet still there remains almost a cer∣tainty
of our being starved to death; for
how is it possible that any body can hear
<PB N="198" REF="211"/>
our cries, in a place so remote from all resort,
and buried, as one may say, under ground,
as this is?”</P>
<P>“Thou art an excellent comforter,”
said Vivaldi, groaning.</P>
<P>“You must allow, Signor, that you are
even with me,” replied Paulo; “and that
you are as excellent a conductor.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi gave no answer, but lay on
the ground, abandoned to agonizing
thought. He had now leisure to consider
the late words of the monk, and to con∣jecture,
for he was in a mood for con∣jecturing
the worst, that they not only
alluded to Ellena, but that his saying
“she had departed an hour ago,” was a
figurative manner of telling that she had
died then. This was a conjecture which dis∣pelled
almost all apprehension for himself.
He started from the ground, and paced his
prison with quick and unequal steps; it
was now no longer a heavy despondency
that oppressed him, but an acute anxiety
<PB N="199" REF="212"/>
that stung him, and, with the tortures of
suspense, brought also those of passionate
impatience and horror concerning the fate,
of Ellena. The longer he dwelt upon
the possibility of her death, the more
probable it appeared. This monk had al∣ready
forewarned him of the death of Bi∣anchi;
and when he recollected the sus∣picious
circumstances which had attended it,
his terrors for Ellena increased. The more
he yielded to his feelings, the more violent
they became, till, at length, his ungovern∣able
impatience and apprehensions arose al∣most
to frenzy.</P>
<P>Paulo forgot, for a while, his own situa∣tion
in the superior sufferings of his master,
and now, at least, endeavoured to perform
the offices of a comforter, for he tried to
calm Vivaldi's mind, by selecting the fairest
circumstances for hope which the subject
admitted, and he passed without noticing,
or, if noticing, only lightly touched upon,
the most prominent possibilities of evil. His
master, however, was insensible to all he
<PB N="200" REF="213"/>
said, till he mentioned again the convent
del Pianto; and this subject, as it seemed
connected with the monk, who had hinted
the fate of Ellena, interested the unhappy
Vivaldi, who withdrew awhile from his own
reflections, to listen to a recital which might
assist his conjectures.</P>
<P>Paulo complied with his command, but
not without reluctance. He looked round
the empty vault, as if he feared that some
person might be lurking in the obscurity,
who would overhear, and even answer him.</P>
<P>“We are tolerably retired here too,
Signor,” said he, recollecting himself;
“one may venture to talk secrets with
little danger of being discovered. However,
<HI>Maestro,</HI> it is best to make matters quite
sure; and therefore, if you will please to
take a seat on the ground, I will stand be∣side
you and relate all I know of the con∣vent
of <HI>Our Lady of Tears,</HI> which is not
much after all.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, having seated himself, and bidden
Paulo do the same, the servant began in a
<PB N="201" REF="214"/>
low voice—“It was on the vigil of the
<HI>Santo Marco,</HI> just after the last vesper-bell had
tolled—You never was at the <HI>Santa Maria
del Pianto,</HI> Signor, or you would know
what a gloomy old church it has.—It was
in a confessional in one of the side ailes of
this church, and just after the last bell had
ceased, that a person, so muffled up, that
neither face nor shape could be distinguished,
came and placed himself on the steps of one
of the boxes adjoining the confessional chair;
but if he had been as airily dressed as your∣self,
Signor, he might have been just as well
concealed; for that dusky aisle is lighted
only by one lamp, which hangs at the end
next the painted window, except when the
tapers at the shrine of San Antonio happen
to be burning at the other extremity, and
even then the place is almost as gloomy as
this vault. But that is, no doubt, contrived
for the purpose, that people may not blush
for the sins they confess; and, in good faith,
this is an accommodation which may bring
more money to the poor's box, for the
<PB N="202" REF="215"/>
monks have a shrewd eye that way,
and”—</P>
<P>“You have dropt the thread of your
story,” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“True, Signor, let me recollect where
I lost it.—Oh! at the steps of the confes∣sional;—the
stranger knelt down upon them,
and for some time poured such groans into
the ear of the confessor, as were heard all
along the aisie. You are to know, Signor,
that the brothers of <HI>Santa del Pianto</HI> are of
the order of <HI>Black Penitents;</HI> and people
who have more sins than ordinary to con∣fess,
sometimes go there, to consult with
the grand penitentiary what is to be done.
Now it <HI>happened,</HI> that Father Ansaldo, the
grand penitentiary himself, was in the
chair, as is customary on the vigil of the
<HI>Santo Marco;</HI> and he gently reproved the
penitent for bewailing so loud, and bade
him take comfort; when the other replied
only by a groan deeper than before, but it
was not so loud, and then proceeded to
confess. But what he did confess, Signor,
<PB N="203" REF="216"/>
I know not; for the confessor, you know,
never must divulge, except, indeed, on very
extraordinary occasions. It was, however,
something so very strange and horrible, that
the grand penitentiary suddenly quitted the
chair, and before he reached the cloisters
he fell into strong convulsions. On re∣covering
himself, he asked the people about
him, whether the penitent, who had visited
such a confessional, naming it, was gone;
adding, that if he was still in the church,
it was proper he should be detained. He
described, at the same time, as well as he
could, the sort of figure he had dimly seen
approaching the confessional just before he
had received the confession, at recollecting
which, he seemed ready to go off again into
his convulsions. One of the fathers, who
had crossed the aisle, on his way to the cloi∣sters,
upon the first alarm of Ansaldo's dis∣order,
remembered that a person, such as
was described, had passed him hastily. He
had seen a tall figure, muffled up in the ha∣bit
of a white friar, gliding swiftly along the
<PB N="204" REF="217"/>
aisle, towards the door which opened into
the outer court of the convent; but he
was himself too much engaged to notice
the stranger particularly. Father Ansaldo
thought this must be the person; and the
porter was summoned, and asked whether
he had observed such an one pass. He af∣firmed
that he had not seen any person go
forth from the gate within the last quarter
of an hour; which might be true enough,
you know, Signor, if the rogue had been
off his post. But he further said, that no
one had entered, during the whole even∣ing,
habited in white, as the stranger was
described to be: so the porter proved him∣self
to be a vigilant watchman; for he
must have been fast asleep too, or how
could this personage have entered the con∣vent,
and left it again, without being seen
by him!”</P>
<P>“In white, was he?” said Vivaldi;
“if he had been in black, I should have
thought this must have been the monk,
my tormentor.”</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="218"/>
“Why, you know, Signor, that oc∣curred
to me before,” observed Paulo,
“and a man might easily change his dress,
if that were all.”</P>
<P>“Proceed,” said: Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Hearing this account from the porter,”
continued Paulo, “the fathers believed, one
and all, that the stranger must be secreted
within the walls; and the convent, with
every part of the precincts, was searched;
but no person was found!”</P>
<P>“This must certainly be the monk,”
said Vivaldi, “notwithstanding the differ∣ence
of his habit; there surely cannot be
two beings in the world, who would con∣duct
themselves in this same mysterious
manner!”</P>
<P>He was interrupted by a low sound, which
seemed, to his distracted fancy, to proceed
from a dying person. Paulo also heard it;
he started, and they both listened with
intense and almost intolerable expectation.</P>
<P>“Ah!” said Paulo, at length, “it was
only the wind.”</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="219"/>
“It was no more,” said Vivaldi;
“proceed therefore.”</P>
<P>“From the period of this strange con∣fession,”
resumed Paulo, “Father Ansaldo
was never properly himself; he”—</P>
<P>“Doubtless the crime confessed related
to himself,” observed Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“Why, no, Signor, I never heard that
that was the case; and some remarkable
circumstances, which followed, seemed to
prove it otherwise. About a month after
the time I have mentioned, on the evening
of a sultry day, when the monks were re∣tiring
from the last service”—</P>
<P>“Hark!” cried Vivaldi.</P>
<P>“I hear whispers,” said Paulo, whisper∣ing
himself.</P>
<P>“Be still!” said Vivaldi.</P>
<P>They listened attentively, and heard a
murmuring, as of voices; but could not
ascertain whether they came from the ad∣joining
vault, or arose from beneath the one
in which they were. The sound returned
at intervals; and the persons who con∣versed,
<PB N="207" REF="220"/>
whatever they were, seemingly re∣strained
their voices, as if they feared to be
heard. Vivaldi considered whether it were
better to discover himself, and call for as∣sistance,
or to remain still.</P>
<P>“Remember, Signor,” said Paulo, “what
a chance we have of being starved, unless we
venture to discover ourselves to these people,
or whatever they are.”</P>
<P>“Venture!” exclaimed Vivaldi. “What
has such a wretch as I to do with fear?
O, Ellena, Ellena!”</P>
<P>He instantly called loudly to the person
whom he believed he had heard, and was
seconded by Paulo; but their continued
vociferations availed them nothing; no
answer was returned; and even the in∣distinct
sounds, which had awakened their
attention, were heard no more.</P>
<P>Exhausted by their efforts, they laid down
oh the floor of the dungeon, abandoning
all further attempts at escape till the morn∣ing
light might assist them.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="221"/>
Vivaldi had no further spirits to enquire
for the remainder of Paulo's narrative. Al∣most
despairing for himself, he could not
feel an interest concerning strangers; for
he had already perceived, that it could not
afford him information connected with
Ellena; and Paulo, who had roared him∣self
hoarse, was very willing to be silent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Who may she be that steals through yonder cloister,</L>
<L>And, as the beam of evening tints her veil,</L>
<L>Unconsciously discloses saintly features,</L>
<L>Inform'd with the high soul of saintly virtue?</L></Q>
<P>DURING several days after Ellena's
arrival at the monastery of San Stefano,
she was not permitted to leave the room.
The door was locked upon her, and not
any person appeared except the nun, who
brought her a scanty portion of food, and
who was the same, that had first admitted
her into that part of the convent appro∣priated
to the abbess.</P>
<P>On the fourth day, when, probably, it
was believed that her spirits were subdued
by confinement, and by her experience of the
suffering she had to expect from resistance,
she was summoned to the parlour. The
abbess was alone, and the air of austerity,
<PB N="210" REF="223"/>
with which she regarded Ellena, prepared
the latter to endure.</P>
<P>After an exordium on the heinousness of
her offence, and the necessity there was for
taking measures to protect the peace and
dignity of a noble family, which her late
conduct had nearly destroyed; the abbess
informed her, that she must determine
either to accept the veil, or the person whom
the Marchesa di Vivaldi had, of her great
goodness, selected for her husband.</P>
<P>“You never can be sufficiently grateful,”
added the abbess, “for the generosity the
Marchesa displays, in allowing you a choice
on the subject. After the injury you have
endeavoured to inflict upon her and her
family, you could not expect that any in∣dulgence
would be shewn you. It was nar∣tural
to suppose, that the Marchesa would
have punished you with severity; instead
of which, she allows you to enter into our
society; or, if you have not strength of
mind sufficient to enable you to renounce a
sinful world, she permits you to return into
<PB N="211" REF="224"/>
it, and gives you a suitable partner to sup∣port
you through its cares and toils,—a
partner much more suitable to your cir∣cumstances
than him, to whom you had
the temerity to lift your eye.”</P>
<P>Ellena blushed at this coarse appeal to
her pride, and persevered in a disdainful
silence. Thus to give to injustice the co∣louring
of mercy, and to acts most abso∣lutely
tyrannical the softening tints of gene∣rosity,
excited her honest indignation. She
was not, however, shocked by a discovery
of the designs formed against her, since
from the moment of her arrival at San
Stefano, she had expected something ter∣ribly
severe, and had prepared her mind to
meet it with fortitude; for she believed,
that, so supported, she should weary the
malice of her enemies, and finally triumph
over misfortune. It was only when she
thought of Vivaldi that her courage failed,
and that the injuries she endured seemed
too heavy to be long sustained.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="225"/>
“You are silent!” said the abbess, after
a pause of expectation. “Is it possible,
then, that you can be ungrateful for the
generosity of the Marchesa? But, though
you may at present be insensible to her
goodness, I will forbear to take advantage
of your indiscretion, and will still allow you
liberty of choice. You may retire to your
chamber, to consider and to decide. But
remember, that you must abide by the de∣termination
you shall avow; and, that you
will be allowed no appeal from the alterna∣tives,
which are now placed before you.—If
you reject the veil, you must accept the
husband who is offered you.”</P>
<P>“It is unnecessary,” said Ellena, with an
air of dignified tranquillity, “that I should
withdraw for the purposes of considering
and deciding. My resolution is already
taken, and I reject each of the offered al∣ternatives.
I will neither condemn myself
to a cloister, or to the degradation, with
which I am threatened on the other hand.
Having said this, I am prepared to meet
<PB N="213" REF="226"/>
whatever suffering you shall inflict upon me;
but be assured, that my own voice never
shall sanction the evils to which I may be
subjected, and that the immortal love of jus∣tice,
which fills all my heart, will sustain my
courage no less powerfully than the sense of
what is due to my own character. You
are now acquainted with my sentiments and
my resolutions; I shall repeat them no
more.”</P>
<P>The abbess, whose surprise had thus long
suffered Ellena to speak, still fixed upon her
a stern regard, as she said, “Where is it that
you have learned these heroics, and acquired,
the rashness which thus prompts you to avow
them!—the boldness which enables you to
insult your Superior, a priestess of your holy
religion, even in her sanctuary!”</P>
<P>“The sanctuary is prophaned,” said El∣lena,
mildly, but with dignity: “it is be∣come
a prison. It is only when the Superior
ceases to respect the precepts of that holy
religion, the precepts which teach her jus∣tice
and benevolence, that she herself is no
<PB N="214" REF="227"/>
longer respected. The very sentiment which
bids us revere its mild and beneficent laws,
bids us also reject die violators of them:
when you command me to reverence my
religion, you urge me to condemn your∣self.”</P>
<P>“Withdraw!” said the abbess, rising
impatiently from her chair; “your ad∣monition,
so becomingly delivered, shall
not be forgotten.”</P>
<P>Ellena willingly obeyed, and was led back
to her cell, where she sat down pensively, and
reviewed her conduct. Her judgment ap∣proved
of the frankness, with which she had
asserted her rights, and of the firmness, with
which she had reproved a woman, who had
dared to demand respect from the very vic∣tim
of her cruelty and oppression. She was
the more satisfied with herself, because
she had never, for an instant, forgotten her
own dignity so far, as to degenerate into the
vehemence of passion, or to faulter with the
weakness of fear. Her conviction of the
abbess's unworthy character, was too clear
<PB N="215" REF="228"/>
to allow Ellena to feel abashed in her pre∣sence;
for she regarded only the censure of
the good, to which she had ever been as
tremblingly alive, as she was obdurately
insensible to that of the vicious.</P>
<P>Ellena, having now asserted her resolu∣tions,
determined to avoid, if possible, all
repetition of scenes like the last, and to
repel by silence only, whatever indignity
might be offered her. She knew that she
must suffer, and she resolved to endure.
Of the three evils, which were placed be∣fore
her, that of confinement, with all its
melancholy accompaniments, appeared con∣siderably
less severe, than either the threat∣ened
marriage, or a formal renunciation of
the world; either of which would devote
her, during life, to misery, and that by
her own act. Her choice, therefore, had
been easy, and the way was plain before
her. If she could endure with calmness
the hardships which she could not avoid,
half their weight would be unfelt; and she
now most strenuously endeavoured to attain
<PB N="216" REF="229"/>
the strength of mind, which was necessary
to support such equanimity.</P>
<P>For several days after the late interview
with the, abbess, she was kept a close pri∣soner;
but on the fifth evening she was
permitted to attend vespers. As she walked
through the garden to the chapel, the ordi∣nary
freshness of the open air and the ver∣dure
of the trees and shrubs were luxuries
to her, who had so long been restricted
from the common blessings of nature. She
followed the nuns to a chapel where they
usually performed their devotions, and was
there seated among the novices. The so∣lemnity
of the service, and particularly of
those parts, which were accompanied by
music, touched all her heart, and soothed
and elevated her spirit.</P>
<P>Among the voices of the choir, was one
whose expression immediately fixed her at∣tention;
it seemed to speak a lostier senti∣ment
of devotion than the others, and to be
modulated by the melancholy of an heart,
<PB N="217" REF="230"/>
that had long since taken leave of this world.
Whether it swelled with the high peal of the
organ, or mingled in low and trembling ac∣cents
with the sinking chorus, Ellena felt
that she understood all the feelings of the
breast from which it flowed; and she looked
to the gallery where the nuns were assem∣bled,
to discover a countenance, that might
seem to accord with the sensibility expressed
in the voice. As no strangers were admit∣ted
to the chapel, some of the sisters had
thrown back their veils, and she saw little
that interested her in their various faces;
but the figure and attitude of a nun, kneel∣ing
in a remote part of the gallery, beneath
a lamp, which threw its rays aslant her head,
perfectly agreed with the idea she had formed
of the singer, and the sound seemed to ap∣proach
immediately from that direction.
Her face was concealed by a black veil,
whose transparency, however, permitted
the fairness of her complexion to appear;
but the air of her head, and the singularity
<PB N="218" REF="231"/>
of her attitude, for she was the only person
who remained kneeling, sufficiently indi∣cated
the superior degree of fervency and
penitence, which the voice had expressed.</P>
<P>When the hymn had ceased, she rose from
her knees, and Ellena, soon after, observ∣ing
her throw back her veil, discovered, by
the lamp, which shed its full light upon her
features, a countenance, that instantly con∣firmed
her conjecture. It was touched with
a melancholy kind of resignation; yet grief
seemed still to occasion the paleness, and
the air of languor, that prevailed over it,
and which disappeared only when the mo∣mentary
energy of devotion seemed to lift
her spirit above this world, and to impart
to it somewhat of a seraphic grandeur. At
those moments her blue eyes were raised
towards Heaven, with such meek, yet fer∣vent
love, such sublime enthusiasm as the
heads of Guido sometimes display, and
which renewed, with Ellena, all the en∣chanting
<PB N="219" REF="232"/>
effects of the voice she had just
heard.</P>
<P>While she regarded the nun with a de∣gree
of interest which rendered her insensible
to every other object in the chapel, she
fancied she could perceive the calmness
in her countenance to be that of despair,
rather than of resignation; for, when her
thoughts were not elevated in prayer, there
was frequently a fixedness in her look, too
energetic for common suffering, or for the
temper of mind, which may lead to perfect
resignation. It had, however, much that
attached the sympathy of Ellena, and much
that seemed to speak a similarity of feeling.
Ellena was not only soothed, but in some
degree comforted, while she gazed upon
her; a selfishness which may, perhaps, be
pardoned, when it is considered, that she
thus knew there was one human being, at
least, in the convent, who must be capable
of feeling pity, and willing to administer
consolation. Ellena endeavoured to meet
<PB N="220" REF="233"/>
her eye, that she might inform her of the
regard she had inspired, and express her
own unhappiness; but the nun was so en∣tirely
engaged by devotion, that she did not
succeed.</P>
<P>As they left the chapel, however, the
nun passed close by Ellena, who threw
back her veil, and fixed upon her a look
so supplicating and expressive, that the nun
paused, and in her turn regarded the no∣vice,
not with surprize only, but with a
mixture of curiosity and compassion. A
faint blush crossed her cheek, her spirits
seemed to faulter, and she was unwilling to
withdraw her eyes from Ellena: but it was
necessary that she should continue in the
procession, and, bidding her farewel by a
smile of ineffable pity, she passed on to the
court, while Ellena followed with attention
still fixed upon the sister, who soon dis∣appeared
beyond the doorway of the Ab∣bess's
apartment, and Ellena had nearly
reached her own, before her thoughts were
<PB N="221" REF="234"/>
sufficiently disengaged to permit her to en∣quire
the name of the stranger.</P>
<P>“It is sister Olivia whom you mean,
perhaps,” said her conductress.</P>
<P>“She is very handsome,” said Ellena.</P>
<P>“Many of the sisters are so,” replied
Margaritone, with an air of pique.</P>
<P>“Undoubtedly,” said Ellena; “but she,
whom I mean, has a most touching counte∣nance;
frank, noble, full of sensibility;
and there is a gentle melancholy in her
eye, which cannot but interest all who
observe her.”</P>
<P>Ellena was so fascinated by this interest∣ing
nun, that she forgot she was describing
her to a person, whose callous heart rendered
her insensible to the influence of any coun∣tenance,
except, perhaps, the commanding
one of the lady abbess; and to whom,
therefore, a description of the fine traits,
which Ellena felt, was as unintelligible as
would have been an Arabic inscription.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="235"/>
“She is passed the bloom of youth,”
continued Ellena, still anxious to be under∣stood;
“but she retains all its interesting
graces, and adds to them the dignity of”—</P>
<P>“If you mean that she is of middle age,”
interrupted Margaritone, peevishly, “it is
sister Olivia you mention, for we are all
younger than she is.”</P>
<P>Ellena, raising her eyes almost uncon∣sciously,
as the nun spoke this, fixed them
upon a face fallow, meagre, seemingly near
fifty years an inhabitant of this world; and
she could scarcely suppress the surprize she
felt, on perceiving such wretched vanity
lingering among the chilled passions of so
repulsive a frame, and within the seques∣tered
shade of a cloister. Margaritone,
still jealous of the praise bestowed on Olivia,
repelled all further enquiry, and, having at∣tended
Ellena to her cell, locked her up for
the night.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="236"/>
On the following evening Ellena was
again permitted to attend vespers, and, on
the way to the chapel, the hope of seeing
her interesting favourite reanimated her
spirits. In the same part of the gallery, as
on the preceding night, she again appeared,
and kneeling, as before, beneath the lamp,
in private orison, for the service was not
begun.</P>
<P>Ellena endeavoured to subdue the im∣patience
she felt to express her regard, and
to be noticed by the holy sister, till she
should have finished. When the nun rose,
and observed Ellena, she lifted her veil,
and, fixing on her the same enquiring eye,
her countenance brightened into a smile so
full of compassion and intelligence, that
Ellena, forgetting the decorums of the
place, left her seat to approach her; it
seemed as if the soul, which beamed forth
in that smile, had long been acquainted
with hers. As she advanced, the nun drop∣ped
her veil, a reproof which me immedi∣ately
<PB N="224" REF="237"/>
understood, and she withdrew to her
seat; but her attention remained fixed on
the nun during the whole service.</P>
<P>At the conclusion, when they left the
chapel, and she saw Olivia pass without no∣ticing
her, Ellena could scarcely restrain
her tears; she returned in deep dejection
to her room. The regard of this nun was
not only delightful, but seemed necessary
to her heart, and she dwelt, with fond per∣severance,
on the smile that had expressed
so much, and which threw one gleam of
comfort, even through the bars of her
prison.</P>
<P>Her reverie was soon interrupted by a
light step, that approached her cell, and in
the next moment the door was unlocked,
and Olivia herself appeared. Ellena rose
with emotion to meet her; the nun held
forth her hand to receive hers,</P>
<P>“You are unused to confinement,” said
she, curtsying mournfully, and placing on
<PB N="225" REF="238"/>
the table a little basket containing refresh∣ment,
“and our hard fare”—</P>
<P>“I understand you,” said Ellena, with
a look expressive of her gratitude; “you
have a heart that can pity, though you in∣habit
these walls;—you have suffered too,
and know the delicate generosity of soften∣ing
the sorrows of others, by any attention
that may tell them your sympathy. O! if
I could express how much the sense of this
affects me!”</P>
<P>Tears interrupted her. Olivia pressed
her hand, looked steadily upon her face,
and was somewhat agitated, but she soon
recovered apparent tranquillity, and said,
with a serious: smile, “You judge, rightly,
my sister, respecting my sentiments, how∣ever
you may do. concerning, my sufferings.
My heart is not insensible to pity, nor to
you, my child. You, were designed for
happier days than you can hope to find
within these cloisters!“</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="239"/>
She checked herself as if she had allowed
too much, and then added, “But you may,
perhaps, be peaceful; and since it consoles
you to know that you have a friend near
you, believe me that friend—but believe it
in silence. I will visit you when I am per∣mitted—but
do not enquire for me; and
if my visits are short, do not press me to
lengthen them.”</P>
<P>“How good this is!” said Ellena, in a
faultering voice. “How sweet too it is!
you will visit me, and I am pitied by
you!”</P>
<P>“Hush!” said the nun, expressively;
“no more; I may be observed. Good
night, my sister; may your slumbers be
light!”</P>
<P>Ellena's heart sunk. She had not spi∣rits
to say, “Good night!” but her eyes,
covered with tears, said more. The nun
turned her own away suddenly, and, pressing
her hand in silence, left the cell. Ellena,
<PB N="227" REF="240"/>
firm and tranquil under the insults of the
abbess, was now melted into tears by the
kindness of a friend. These gentle tears
were refreshing to her long-oppressed spi∣rits,
and she indulged them. Of Vivaldi
she thought with more composure than she
had done since she left the villa Altieri;
and something like hope began to revive
in her heart, though reflection offered no∣thing
to support it.</P>
<P>On the following morning, she perceived
that the door of her cell had not been
closed. She rose impatiently, and, not
without a hope of liberty, immediately
passed it. The cell, opening, upon a short
passage, which communicated with the main
building, and which was shut up by a door,
was secluded, and almost insulated from
every other chamber; and this door being
now secured, Ellena was as truly a prisoner
as before. It appeared then, that the nun
had omitted to fasten the cell only for the
purpose of allowing her more space to walk
<PB N="228" REF="241"/>
in the passage, and she was grateful for the
attention. Still more she was so, when,
having traversed it, she perceived one ex∣tremity
terminate in a narrow stair-case,
that appeared to lead to other chambers.</P>
<P>She ascended the winding steps hastily,
and found they led only to a door, open∣ing
into a small room, where nothing
remarkable appeared, till she approached
the windows, and beheld thence an hori∣zon,
and a landscape spread below, whose
grandeur awakened all her heart. The
consciousness of her prison was lost, while
her eyes ranged over the wide and freely∣sublime
scene without. She perceived that
this chamber was within a small turret, pro∣jecting
from an angle of the convent over
the walls, and suspended, as in air, above
the vast precipices of granite, that formed
part of the mountain. These precipices
were broken into cliffs, which, in some
places, impended far above their base, and,
in others, rose, in nearly-perpendicular
<PB N="229" REF="242"/>
lines, to the walls of the monastery, which
they supported. Ellena, with a dreadful
pleasure, looked down them, shagged as they
were with larch, and frequently darkened
by lines of gigantic pine bending along the
rocky ledges, till her eye rested on the thick
chesnut woods that extended over their
winding base, and which, softening to the
plains, seemed to form a gradation between
the variegated cultivation there, and the
awful wildness of the rocks above. Round
these extensive plains were tumbled the
mountains, of various shape and attitude,
which Ellena had admired on her approach
to San Stefano; some shaded with forests
of olive and almond trees, but the greater
part abandoned to the flocks, which, in
summer, feed on their aromatic herbage,
and on the approach of winter, descend to
the sheltered plains of the <HI>Tavogliere di
Puglia.</HI></P>
<P>On the left opened the dreadful, pass
which she had traversed, and the thunder
<PB N="230" REF="243"/>
of whose waters now murmured, at a dis∣tance.
The accumulation of overtopping
points, which the mountains of this dark
perspective exhibited, presented an image of
grandeur superior to any thing she had
seen while within the pass itself.</P>
<P>To Ellena, whose mind was capable of be∣ing
highly elevated, or sweetly soothed, by
scenes of nature, the discovery of this little
turret was an important circumstance. Hi∣ther
she could come, and her soul, refreshed
by the views it afforded, would acquire
strength to bear her, with equanimity,
thro' the persecutions that might await her.
Here, gazing upon the stupendous imagery
around her, looking, as it were, beyond the
awful veil which obscures the features, of the
Deity, and conceals Him from the eyes of
his creatures, dwelling as with a present
God in the midst of his sublime works;
with a mind thus elevated, how insignifi∣cant
would appear to her the transactions,
and the sufferings of this world! How
<PB N="231" REF="244"/>
poor the boasted power of man, when the
fall of a single cliff from these mountains
would with ease destroy thousands of his
race assembled on the plains below! How
would it avail them, that they were ac∣coutred
for battle, armed with all the in∣struments
of destruction that human inven∣tion
ever fashioned? Thus man, the giant
who now held her in captivity, would shrink
to the diminutiveness of a fairy; and she
would experience, that his utmost force was
unable to enchain her soul, or compel her
to fear him, while he was destitute of
virtue.</P>
<P>Ellena's attention was recalled from the
seene without by a sound from within the
gallery, and she then heard a key turning
in the door of the passage. Fearing that it
was sister Margaritone who approached,
and who, informed by her absence of the
consolatory turret she had discovered, would
perhaps debar her from ever returning, to
it, Ellena descended with a palpitating heart,
<PB N="232" REF="245"/>
and found that nun in the cell. Surprize
and severity were in her countenance, when
she enquired by what means Ellena had
unclosed the door, and whither she had
been.</P>
<P>Ellena answered without any prevarica∣tion,
that she had found the door un∣fastened,
and that she had visited the turret
above; but she forbore to express a wish
to return thither, judging that such an ex∣pression
would certainly exclude her in fu∣ture.
Margaritone, after sharply rebuking
her for prying beyond the passage, and, set∣ting
down the breakfast she had brought,
left the room, the door of which she did
not forget to secure. Thus Ellena was at
once deprived of so innocent a means of
consolation as her pleasant turret had af∣forded.</P>
<P>During several days, she saw only the
austere nun, except when she attended ves∣pers;
where, however, she was so vigilantly
observed, that she feared to speak with
<PB N="233" REF="246"/>
Olivia, even by her eyes. Olivia's were
often fixed upon her face, and with a kind
of expression Which Ellena, when she did ven∣ture
to look at her, could not perfectly in∣terpret.
It was not only of pity, but of anxi∣ous
curiosity, and of something also like
fear. A blush would sometimes wander
over her cheek, which was succeeded by an
extreme paleness, and by an air of such
universal languor as precedes a fainting fit:
but the exercises of devotion seemed fre∣quently
to recal her fleeting spirits, and to
elevate them with hope and courage.</P>
<P>When she left the chapel, Ellena saw
Olivia no more that night; but on the fol∣lowing
morning she came with breakfast to
the cell. A character of peculiar sadness
was on her brow.</P>
<P>“O! how glad I am to see you!” said
Ellena; “and how much I have regretted
your long absence! I was obliged to re∣member
constantly what you had enjoined,
to forbear enquiring after you.”</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="247"/>
The nun replied with a melancholy smile,
“I come in obedience to our lady abbess,”
said she, as she seated herself on Ellena's
mattress.</P>
<P>“And did you not wish to come?” said
Ellena, mournfully.</P>
<P>“I did wish it,” replied Olivia; “but”
and she hesitated.</P>
<P>“Whence then this reluctance?” en∣quired
Ellena.</P>
<P>Olivia was silent a moment.</P>
<P>“You are a messenger of evil news<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>”
said Ellena; “you are only reluctant to
afflict me.”</P>
<P>“It is as you say,” replied Olivia; “I am
only reluctant to afflict you; and I fear
you have too many attachments to the world,
to allow you to receive, without sorrow,
what I have to communicate. I am ordered
to prepare you for the vows, and to say, that,
since you have rejected the husband which
was proposed to you, you are to accept the
veil; that many of the customary forms
<PB N="235" REF="248"/>
are to be dispensed with; and that the cere∣mony
of taking the black veil, will follow
without delay that of receiving the white one.”</P>
<P>The nun paused; and Ellena said,
“You are an Unwilling bearer of this cruel
message; and I reply only to the lady ab∣bess,
when I declare, that I never will ac∣cept
either; that force may send me to the
altar, but that it never shall compel me to
utter vows which my heart abhors; and if
I am constrained to appear there, it shall be
only to protest against her tyranny, and
against the form intended to sanction it.”</P>
<P>To Olivia this answer was so far from
being displeasing, that it appeared to give
her satisfaction.</P>
<P>“I dare not applaud your resolution,”
said she; “but I will not condemn, it.
You have, no doubt, connections in the
world which would render a seclusion from
it afflicting. You have relations, friends,
from whom it would be dreadful to part?”</P>
<P>“I have neither,” said Ellena, sighing.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="249"/>
“No! Can that be possible? and yet
you are so unwilling to retire!”</P>
<P>“I have only one friend,” replied Ellena,
“and it is of him they would deprive me!”</P>
<P>“Pardon, my love, the abruptness of these
enquiries,” said Olivia; “yet, while I en∣treat
your forgiveness, I am inclined to of∣fend
again, and to ask your name.”</P>
<P>“That is a question I will readily answer.
My name is Ellena di Rosalba.”</P>
<P>“How?” said Olivia, with an air of
deliberation; “Ellena di”—</P>
<P>“Di Rosalba,” repeated her companion;
“and permit me to ask your motive for the
enquiry: do you know any person of my
name?”</P>
<P>“No,” replied the nun, mournfully;
“but your features have some resemblance
to those of a friend I once had.”</P>
<P>As she said this, her agitation was apparent,
and she rose to go. “I must not lengthen
my visit, lest I should be forbidden to repeat
it,” said she. “What answer shall I give to
<PB N="237" REF="250"/>
the abbess? If you are determined to reject
the veil, allow me to advise you to soften
your refusal as much as possible. I am,
perhaps, better acquainted with her cha∣racter
than you are; and O, my sister!
I would not see; you pining away your ex∣istence
in this solitary cell.”</P>
<P>“How much I am obliged by the inter∣est
you express for my welfare,” said Ellena,
“and by the advice you offer! I will yield
my judgment in this instance to yours; you
shall modulate my refusal as you think pro∣per:
but remember that it must be absolute;
and beware, left the abbess should mistake
gentleness for irresolution.”</P>
<P>“Trust me, I will be cautious in all that
relates to you,” said Olivia. “Farewell!
I will visit you, if possible, in the evening.
In the mean time the door shall be left open,
that you may have more air and prospect
than this cell affords. That staircase leads
to a pleasant chamber.”</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="251"/>
“I have visited it already,” replied El∣lena,
“and have to thank you for the
goodness, which permitted me to do so.
To go thither will greatly soothe my spirits;
if I had some book, and my drawing-instru∣ments,
I could almost forget my sorrows
there.”</P>
<P>“Could you so?” said the nun, with an
affectionate smile. “Adieu! I will endea∣vour
to see you in the evening. If sister
Margaritone returns, be careful not to en∣quire
for me; nor once ask her for the little
indulgence I give you.”</P>
<P>Olivia withdrew, and Ellena retired to the
chamber above, where she lost for a while
all sense of sorrow amidst the great
scenery,
which its windows exhibited.</P>
<P>At noon, the step of Margaritone sum∣moned
Ellena from her retreat, and she
was surprised that no reproof followed this
second discovery of her absence. Marga∣ritone
only said, that the abbess had the
goodness to permit Ellena to dine with the
<PB N="239" REF="252"/>
novices, and that she came to conduct her
to their table.</P>
<P>Ellena did not rejoice in this permission,
preferring to remain in her solitary turret,
to the being exposed to the examining eyes
of strangers; and she followed dejectedly,
through the silent passages to the apartment
where they were assembled. She was not
less surprised than embarrassed to
observe,
in the manners of young people residing
in a convent, an absence of that deco∣rum,
which includes beneath its modest
shade every grace that ought to adorn the
female character, like the veil which gives
dignity to their air and softness to their fea∣tures.
When Ellena entered the room,
the eyes of the whole company were imme∣diately
fixed upon her; the young ladies
began to whisper and smile, and shewed,
by various means, that she was the subject
of conversation, not otherwise than cen∣sorious.
No one advanced to meet and to
encourage her, to welcome her to the table,
<PB N="240" REF="253"/>
or still less display one of those nameless
graces, with which a generous and delicate
mind delights to reanimate the modest and
the unfortunate.</P>
<P>Ellena took a chair In silence; and,
though she had at first felt forlorn and em∣barrassed
by the impertinent manners of her
companions, a consciousness of innocence
gradually revived her spirits, and enabled
her to resume an air of dignity, which re∣pressed
this rude presumption.</P>
<P>Ellena returned to her cell, for the first
time, with eagerness. Margaritone did not
fasten the door of it, but she was careful to
secure that of the passage; and even this
small indulgence she seemed to allow with a
surly reluctance, as if compelled to obey
the command of a superior. The moment
she was gone, Ellena withdrew to her plea∣sant
turret, where, after having suffered
from the coarse manners of the novices, her
gratitude was the more lively, when she
perceived the delicate attention of her be∣loved
<PB N="241" REF="254"/>
nun. It appeared that she had visit∣ed
the chamber in Ellena's absence, and
had caused to be brought thither a chair
and a table, on which were placed some
books, and a knot of fragrant flowers.
Ellena did not repress the grateful tears,
which the generous feelings of Olivia
excited; and she forbore, for some mo∣ments,
to examine the books, that the plea∣sing
emotions she experienced might not be
interrupted.</P>
<P>On looking into these books, however,
she perceived, that some of them treated of
mystical subjects, which she laid aside with
disappointment; but in others she observed
a few of the best Italian poets, and a volume
or two of Guicciardini's history. She was
somewhat surprised, that the poets should
have found their way to the library of a nun,
but was too much pleased with the disco∣very
to dwell on the enquiry.</P>
<P>Having arranged her books, and set her
little room in order, she seated herself at a
<PB N="242" REF="255"/>
window, and, with a volume of Tasso, en∣deavoured
to banish every painful remem∣brance
from her mind. She continued
wandering in the imaginary scenes of the
poet, till the fading light recalled her to
those of reality. The sun was set, but the
mountain-tops were still lighted up by his
beams, and a tint of glorious purple co∣loured
all the west, and began to change
the snowy points on the horizon. The
silence and repose of the vast scene, pro∣moted
the tender melancholy that prevailed
in her heart; she thought of Vivaldi, and
wept—of Vivaldi, whom she might, per∣haps,
never see again, though she doubted
not that he would be indefatigable in search∣ing
for her. Every particular of their last
conversation, when he had so earnestly la∣mented
the approaching separation, even
while he allowed of its propriety, came to
her mind; and, while she witnessed, in
imagination, the grief and distraction, which
her mysterious departure and absence must
<PB N="243" REF="256"/>
have occasioned him, the fortitude, with
which she had resisted her own sufferings,
yielded to the picture of his.</P>
<P>The vesper-bell, at length, summoned her
to prepare for mass, and she descended to
her cell to await the arrival of her con∣ductress.
It was Margaritone, who soon
appeared; but in the chapel she, as usual,
saw Olivia, who, when the service had con∣cluded,
invited her into the garden of the
convent. There, as she walked beneath the
melancholy cypresses, that, ranged on either
side the long walks, formed a majestic ca∣nopy,
almost excluding the evening twi∣light,
Olivia conversed with her on serious,
but general, topics, carefully avoiding any
mention of the abbess, and of the affairs of
Ellena. The latter, anxious to learn the
effect of her repeated rejection of the veil,
ventured to make some enquiries, which
the nun immediately discouraged, and as
cautiously checked the grateful effusions of
her young friend for the attentions she had
received.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="257"/>
Olivia accompanied Ellena to her cell,
and there no longer scrupled to relieve her
from uncertainty. With a mixture of
frankness and discretion, she related as
much of the conversation, that had passed
between herself and the abbess, as it ap∣peared
necessary for Ellena to know, from
which it seemed that the former was as ob∣stinate,
as the latter was firm.</P>
<P>“Whatever may be your resolution,”
added the nun, “I earnestly advise you,
my sister, to allow the Superior some hope
of compliance, lest she proceed to extre∣mities.”</P>
<P>“And what extremity can be more ter∣rible,”
replied Ellena, “than either of
those, to which she would now urge me?
Why should I descend to practice dissimu∣lation?”</P>
<P>“To save yourself from undeserved suf∣ferings,”
said Olivia mournfully.</P>
<P>“Yes, but I should then incur deserved
ones,” observed Ellena; “and forfeit such
<PB N="245" REF="258"/>
peace of mind as my oppressors never could
restore to me.” As she said this, she look∣ed
at the nun with an expression of gentle
reproach and disappointment.</P>
<P>“I applaud the justness of your senti∣ment,”
replied Olivia, regarding her with
tenderest compassion. “Alas! that a mind
so noble should be subjected to the power
of injustice and depravity!”</P>
<P>“Not subjected,” said Ellena, “do not
say subjected. I have accustomed myself to
contemplate those sufferings; I have chosen
the least of such as were given to my choice,
and I will endure them with fortitude; and
can you then say that I am subjected?”</P>
<P>“Alas, my sister! you know not what you
promise,” replied Olivia; “you do not
comprehend the sufferings which may be
preparing for you.”</P>
<P>As she spoke, her eyes filled with tears,
and she withdrew them from Ellena, who,
surprised at the extreme concern on her
countenance, entreated she would explain
herself.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="259"/>
“I am not certain, myself, as to this
point,” said Olivia; “and if I were,
I should not dare to explain it.”</P>
<P>“Not dare!” repeated Ellena, mourn∣fully.
“Can benevolence like yours know
fear, when courage is necessary to prevent
evil?”</P>
<P>“Enquire no further!” said Olivia; but
no blush of conscious duplicity stained her
cheek. “It is sufficient that you understand
the consequence of open resistance to be
terrible, and that you consent to avoid it.”</P>
<P>“But how avoid it, my beloved friend,
without incurring a consequence which, in
my apprehension, would be yet more dread∣ful?
How avoid it, without either subject∣ing
myself to a hateful marriage, or accept∣ing
the vows? Either of these events would
be more terrible to me, than any thing with
which I may be menaced.”</P>
<P>“Perhaps not,” said the nun. “Ima∣gination
cannot draw the horrors of—But,
my sister, let me repeat, that I would
<PB N="247" REF="260"/>
save you! O, how willingly save you from
the evils preparing! and that the only chance
of doing so is, by prevailing with you to aban∣don
at least the appearance of resistance.”</P>
<P>“Your kindness deeply affects me,” said
Ellena; “and I am fearful of appearing in∣sensible
of it, when I reject your advice; yet
I cannot adopt it. The very dissimulation,
which I should employ in self-defence, might
be a means of involving me in destruction.”</P>
<P>As Ellena concluded, and her eyes glanced
upon the nun, unaccountable suspicion oc∣curred
to her, that Olivia might be in∣sincere,
and that, at this very moment,
when she was advising dissimulation, she
was endeavouring to draw Ellena into some
snare, which the abbess had laid. She sick∣ened
at this dreadful supposition, and dis∣missed
it without suffering herself to exa∣mine
its probability. That Olivia, from
whom she had received so many attentions,
whose countenance and manners announced
so fair a mind, and for whom she had con∣ceived
<PB N="248" REF="261"/>
so much esteem and affection, should
be cruel and treacherous, was a suspicion
that gave her more pain, than the actual
imprisonment in which she suffered; and
when she looked again upon her face, El∣lena
was consoled by a clear conviction,
that she was utterly incapable of perfidy.</P>
<P>“If it were possible that I could consent
to practise deceit,” resumed Ellena, after a
long pause, “what could it avail me? I am
entirely in the power of the abbess, who
would soon put my sincerity to the proof;
when a discovery of my duplicity would
only provoke her vengeance, and I should
be punished even for having sought to
avoid injustice.”</P>
<P>“If deceit is at any time excusable,” re∣plied
Olivia, reluctantly, “it is when we
practise it in self-defence. There are some
rare situations, when it may be resorted to
without our incurring ignominy, and yours
is one of those. But I will acknowledge,
that all the good I expect is from the delay
<PB N="249" REF="262"/>
which temporizing may procure you. The
Superior, when she understands there is a
probability of obtaining your confent to her
wishes, may be willing to allow you the
usual time of preparation for the veil, and
meanwhile something may occur to rescue
you from your present situation.”</P>
<P>“Ah! could I but believe so!” said
Ellena; “but, alas! what power can res∣cue
me? And I have not one relative
remaining even to attempt my deliverance.
To what possibility do you allude?”</P>
<P>“The Marchesa may relent.”</P>
<P>“Does, then, your possibility of good rest
with her, my dear friend? If so, I am in
despair again; for such a chance of benefit,
there would certainly be little policy in for∣feiting
one's integrity.”</P>
<P>“There are also other possibilities, my
sister,” said Olivia; “but hark! what bell
is that? It is the chime which assembles
the nuns in the apartment of the abbess,
where she dispenses her evening benedic∣tion.
<PB N="250" REF="263"/>
My absence will be observed. Good
night, my sister. Reflect on what I have
advised; and remember, I conjure you, to
consider, that the consequence of your de∣cision
must be solemn, and may be fatal.”</P>
<P>The nun spoke this with a look and em∣phasis
so extraordinary, that Ellena at once
wished and dreaded to know more; but be∣fore
she had recovered from her surprize,
Olivia had left the room.</P>

<L>Of horror, worn to habitude.”</L>
<BIBL>MYSTERIOUS MOTHER.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE adventurous Vivaldi, and his servant
Paulo, after passing the night of Ellena's de∣parture
from villa Altieri in one of the sub∣terraneous
chambers of the fort of Paluzzi,
and yielding, at length, to exhausted nature,
awoke in terror and utter darkness, for the
flambeau had expired. When a recollec∣tion
of the occurrences of the preceding
evening returned, they renewed their efforts
for liberty with ardour. The grated win∣dow
was again examined, and being found
to overlook only a confined court of the
fortress, no hope appeared of escaping.</P>
<P>The words of the monk returned with
Vivaldi's first recollections, to torture him
<PB N="252" REF="265"/>
with apprehension, that Ellena was no
more; and Paulo, unable either to console
or to appease his master, sat down deject∣edly
beside him. Paulo had no longer a
hope to suggest, or a joke to throw away;
and he could not forbear seriously remark∣ing,
that to die of hunger was one of the
most horrible means of death, or lamenting
the rashness which had made them liable to
so sad a probability.</P>
<P>He was in the midst of a very pathetic
oration, of which, however, his master did
not hear a single word, so wholly was his
attention engaged by his own melancholy
thoughts, when on a sudden he became
silent, and then, starting to his feet, ex∣claimed,
“Signor, what is yonder? Do you
see nothing?”</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked round.</P>
<P>“It is certainly a ray of light,” con∣tinued
Paulo; “and I will soon know
where it comes from.”</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="266"/>
As he said this he sprung forward, and
his surprize almost equalled his, joy, when he
discovered that the light issued through the
door of the vault, which stood a little open.
He could scarcely believe, his senses, since
the door had been strongly fastened on the
preceding night, and he had not heard its
ponderous bolts undrawn. He threw it
widely open, but recollecting himself, slop∣ped
to look into the adjoining vault before
he ventured forth; when Vivaldi darted
past him, and bidding him follow instant∣ly,
ascended to the day. The courts of
the fortress were silent and vacant, and
Vivaldi reached the arch-way without hav∣ing
observed a single person, breathless with
speed, and scarcely daring to believe that
he had regained his liberty.</P>
<P>Beneath the arch He stopped to recover
breath, and to confider whether he should
take the road to Naples, or to the villa Alti∣eri,
for it was yet early morning, and at an
hour when it appeared improbable that
<PB N="254" REF="267"/>
Ellena's family would be risen. The ap∣prehension
of her death had vanished as
Vivaldi's spirits revived, which the pause of
hesitation sufficiently announced: but even
this was the pause only of an instant; a
strong anxiety concerning her determined
him to proceed to the villa Altieri, notwith∣standing
the unsuitableness of the hour,
since he could, at least, reconnoitre her resi∣dence,
and await till some sign of the family
having risen should appear.</P>
<P>“Pray, Signor,” said Paulo, while his
master was deliberating, “do not let us
stop here lest the enemy should appear
again; and do, Signor, take the road which
is nearest to some house where we may get
breakfast, for the fear of starving has taken
such hold upon me, that it has nearly anti∣cipated
the reality of it already.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi immediately departed for the
villa. Paulo, as he danced joyfully along,
expressed all the astonishment that filled
his mind, as to the cause of their late im∣prisonment
<PB N="255" REF="268"/>
and escape; but Vivaldi, who
had now leizure to consider the subject,
could not assist him in explaining it. The
only certainty that appeared, was, that he
had not been confined by robbers; and
what interest any person could have in im∣prisoning
him for the night, and suffering
him to escape in the morning, did not ap∣pear.</P>
<P>On entering the garden at Altieri, he
was surprized to observe that several of the
lower lattices were open at this early hour,
but surprize changed to terror, when, on
reaching the portico, he heard a moaning
of distress from the hall, and when, after
loudly calling, he was answered by the
piteous cries of Beatrice. The hall door
was fastened, and, Beatrice being unable to
open it, Vivaldi, followed by Paulo, sprang
through one of the unclosed lattices; when
on reaching the hall, he found the house∣keeper
bound to a pillar, and learned that
<PB N="256" REF="269"/>
Ellena had been carried off during the night
by armed men.</P>
<P>For a moment he was almost stupisied
by the shock of this intelligence, and then
asked Beatrice a thousand questions con∣cerning
the affair, without allowing her
time to answer one of them. When, how∣ever,
he had patience to listen, he learned,
that the ruffians were four in number;
that they were masked; that two of them
had carried Ellena through the garden,
while the others, after binding Beatrice to
a pillar, threatening her with death if she
made any noise, and watching over her till,
their comrades had secured their prize,
left her a prisoner. This was all the inform∣ation
she could give respecting Ellena.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, when he could think coolly, be∣lieved
he had discovered the instigators
and the design of the whole affair, and the
cause, also, of his late confinement. It
appeared that Ellena had been carried off
by order of his family, to prevent the in∣tended
<PB N="257" REF="270"/>
marriage, and that he had been de∣coyed
into the fort of Paluzzi, and kept a
prisoner there, to prevent him from, inter∣cepting
the scheme, which his presence at
the villa Altieri would effectually have done.
He had himself spoken of his former ad∣venture
at Paluzzi; and it now appeared,
that his family had taken advantage of the
curiosity he had expressed, to lead him into
the vaults. The event of this design was the
more certain, since, as the fort lay in the
direct road to the villa Altieri, Vivaldi could
not go thither without being observed by the
creatures of the Marchesa, who, by an art∣ful
manoeuvre, might make him their pri∣soner,
without employing violence.</P>
<P>As he considered these circumstances, it
appeared certain, also, that father Schedoni
was in truth the monk who had so long
haunted his steps; that he was the secret
adviser of his mother, and one of the au∣thors
of the predicted misfortunes, which,
it seemed, he possessed a too certain means
<PB N="258" REF="271"/>
of fulfilling. Yet Vivaldi, while he admit∣ted
the probability of all this, reflected with
new-astonishment on the conduct of Sche∣doni,
during his interview with him in the
Marchesa's cabinet;—the air of dignified
innocence, with which he had repressed ac∣cusation,
the apparent simplicity, with which
he had pointed out circumstances respecting
the stranger, that seemed to make against
himself; and Vivaldi's opinion of the con∣fessor's
duplicity began to waver. “Yet
what other person,” said he, “could be so
intimately acquainted with my concerns, or
have an interest sufficiently strong for thus
indefatigably thwarting me, except this
confessor, who is, no doubt, well rewarded
for his perseverance? The monk can be
no other than Schedoni, yet it is strange
that he should have forborn to disguise his
person, and should appear in his mysterious
office in the very habit he usually wears!”</P>
<P>Whatever might be the truth as to Sche∣doni
it was evident that Ellena had been
<PB N="259" REF="272"/>
carried away by order of Vivaldi's family,
and he immediately returned towards Naples
with an intention of demanding her at their
hands, not with any hope of their com∣pliance,
but believing that they might ac∣cidentally
afford him some lights on the
subject. If, however, he should fail to ob∣tain
any hint that might assist him in trace∣ing
the route she had been carried, he de∣termined
to visit Schedoni, accuse him of
persidy, urge him to a full explanation of
his conduct, and, if possible, obtain from
him a knowledge of Ellena's place of con∣finement.</P>
<P>When, at length, he obtained an inter∣view
with the Marchese, and, throwing him∣self
at his feet, supplicated that Ellena might
be restored to her home, the unaffected
surprize of his father overwhelmed him
with astonishment and despair. The look
and manner of the Marchese could not be
doubted; Vivaldi was convinced that he
<PB N="260" REF="273"/>
was absolutely ignorant of any step which
had been taken against Ellena.</P>
<P>“However ungraciously you have con∣ducted
yourself,” said the Marchese, “my
honour has never yet been sullied by dupli∣city;
however I may have wished to break
the unworthy connection you have formed,
I should disdain to employ artifice as the
means. If you really design to marry this
person, I shall make no other effort to pre∣vent
such a measure, than by telling you
the consequence you are to expect;—from
thenceforth I will disown you for my son.”</P>
<P>The Marchese quitted the apartment
when he had said this, and Vivaldi made
no attempt to detain him. His words: ex∣pressed
little more than they had formerly
done, yet Vivaldi was shocked by the ab∣solute
menace now delivered. The strong∣er
passion of his heart, however, soon over∣came
their effect; and this moment, when
he began to fear that he had irrecoverably
lost the object of his dearest affections, was
<PB N="261" REF="274"/>
not the time, in which he could long feel
remoter evils, or calculate the force of mis∣fortunes
which never might arrive. The
nearer interest pressed solely upon his mind,
and he was conscious only to the loss of
Ellena.</P>
<P>The interview, which followed with his
mother, was of a different character from
that, which had occurred with the Marchese.
The keen dart of suspicion, however, sharp∣ened
as it was by love and by despair,
pierced beyond the veil of her duplicity;
and Vivaldi as quickly detected her hypo∣crisy
as he had yielded his conviction to the
sincerity of the Marchese. But his power
rested here; he possessed no means of awaken∣ing
her pity or actuating her justice, and
could not obtain even a hint, that might
guide him in his search of Ellena.</P>
<P>Schedoni, however, yet remained to be
tried; Vivaldi had no longer a doubt as to
his having caballed with the Marchesa, and
that he had been an agent in removing El∣lena.
<PB N="262" REF="275"/>
Whether he was the person who
haunted the ruins of Paluzzi, still remained
to be proved, for, though several circum∣stances
seemed to declare that he was,
others, not less plausible, asserted the con∣trary.</P>
<P>On leaving the Marchesa's apartment,
Vivaldi repaired to the convent of the Spi∣rito
Santo, and enquired for father Sche∣doni.
The lay-brother who opened the
gate, informed him that the father was in
his cell, and Vivaldi stepped impatiently into
the court requesting to be shewn thither.</P>
<P>“I dare not leave the gate, Signor,”
said the brother, “but if you cross the
court, and ascend that stair-case which you
see yonder beyond the door-way on your
right, it will lead you to a gallery, and the
third door you will come to is father Sche∣doni's.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi passed on without seeing another
human being, and not a sound disturbed
the silence of this sanctuary, till, as he
<PB N="263" REF="276"/>
ascended the stairs, a feeble note of lament∣ation,
proceeded from the gallery, and he
concluded it was uttered by some penitent
at confession.</P>
<P>He stopped, as he had been directed, at
the third door, when, as he gently knock∣ed,
the sound ceased, and the same pro∣found
silence returned. Vivaldi repeated
his summons, but, receiving no answer, he
ventured to open the door. In the dusky
cell within no person appeared, but he still
looked round, expecting to discover some
one in the dubious gloom. The chamber
contained little more than a mattress, a chair,
a table, and a crucisix; some books of devo∣tion
were upon the table, one or two of
which were written in unknown charac∣ters;
several instruments of torture lay be∣side
them. Vivaldi shuddered as he hastily
examined these, though he did not compre∣hend
the manner of their application, and
he left the chamber, without noticing any
other object, and returned to the court.
<PB N="264" REF="277"/>
The porter said, that since father Schedoni
was not in his cell, he was probably either
in the church or in the gardens, for that he
had not passed the gates during the morning.</P>
<P>“Did he pass yester-evening?” said Vi∣valid,
eagerly.</P>
<P>“Yes, he returned to vespers,“replied
the brother with surprize.</P>
<P>” Are you certain as to that, my friend?”
rejoined Vivaldi, “are you certain that he
slept in the convent last night?”</P>
<P>” Who is it that asks the question?” said
the lay-brother, with displeasure, “and
what right has he to make it? You are
ignorant of the rules of our house, Signor,
or you would perceive such questions to be
unnecessary; any member of our com∣munity
is liable to be severely punished if
he sleep a night without these walls, and
father Schedoni would be the last among
us so to trespass. He is one of the most
pious of the brotherhood; few indeed have
<PB N="265" REF="278"/>
courage to imitate his severe example. His
voluntary sufferings are sufficient for a saint.
He pass the night abroad? Go, Signor, yon∣der
is the church, you will find him there,
perhaps.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi did not linger to reply. “The
hypocrite!” said he to himself as he cross∣ed
to the church, which formed one side
of the quadrangle; “but I will unmask
him.”</P>
<P>The church, which he entered, was va∣cant
and silent like the court. “Whither
can the inhabitants of this place have with∣drawn
themselves?” said he; “wherever
I go, I hear only the echoes of my own
footsteps; it seems as if death reigned here
over all! But, perhaps, it is one of the
hours of general meditation, and the monks
have only retired to their cells.”</P>
<P>As he paced the long aisles, he suddenly
stopped to catch the startling sound that
murmured through the losty roof; but it
seemed to be only the closing of a distant
<PB N="266" REF="279"/>
door. Yet he often looked forward into
the sacred gloom, which the painted win∣dows
threw over the remote perspective,
in the expectation of perceiving a monk.
He was not long disappointed; a person
appeared, standing silently in an obscure
part of the cloister, cloathed in the habit
of this society, and he advanced towards
him.</P>
<P>The monk did not avoid Vivaldi, or even
turn to observe who was approaching, but
remained in the same attitude, fixed like a
statue. This tall and gaunt figure had, at
a distance, reminded him of Schedoni, and
Vivaldi, as he now looked under the cowl,
discovered the ghastly countenance of the
confessor.</P>
<P>“Have I found you at last?” said Vivaldi.
“I would speak with you, father, in pri∣vate.
This is not a proper place for such
discourse as we must hold.”</P>
<P>Schedoni made no reply, and Vivaldi,
once again looking at him, observed that
<PB N="267" REF="280"/>
his features were fixed, and his eyes bent
towards the ground. The words of Vi∣valid
seemed not to have reached his under∣standing,
nor even to have made any im∣pression
on his senses.</P>
<P>He repeated them in a louder tone, but
still not a single line of Schedoni's counte∣nance
acknowledged their influence. “What
means this mummery?” said he, his pa∣tience
exhausted, and his indignation arous∣ed;
“This wretched subterfuge shall not
protect you, you are detected, your stra∣tagems
are known! Restore Ellena di Ro∣salba
to her home, or confess where you
have concealed her.”</P>
<P>Schedoni was still silent and unmoved.
A respect for his age and profession with∣held
Vivaldi from seizing and compelling
him to answer; but the agony of impa∣tience
and indignation which he suffered,
formed a striking contrast to the death-like
apathy of the monk. “I now also know
you,” continued Vivaldi, “for my tormentor
<PB N="268" REF="281"/>
at Paluzzi, the prophet of evils, which
you too well practised the means of fulfil∣ling,
the predictor of the death of Signora
Bianchi.” Schedoni frowned. “The fore∣warner
of Ellena's departure; the phan∣tom
who decoyed me into the dungeons of
Paluzzi; the prophet and the artificer of
all my misfortunes.”</P>
<P>The monk raised his eyes from the
ground, and fixed them with terrible ex∣pression
upon Vivaldi, but was still silent.</P>
<P>“Yes, father,” added Vivaldi, “I know
and will proclaim you to the world. I will
strip you of the holy hypocrisy in which
you shroud yourself; announce to all your
society the despicable artifices you have em∣ployed,
and the misery you have occasion∣ed.
Your character shall be announced
aloud.”</P>
<P>While Vivaldi spoke, the monk had
withdrawn his eyes, and fixed them again
on the ground. His countenance had re∣sumed
its usual expression.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="282"/>
“Wretch! restore to me Ellena di Ro∣salba!”
cried Vivaldi, with the sudden
anguish of renewed despair. “Tell me at
least, where she may be found, or you shall
be compelled to do so. Whither, whither
have you conveyed her?”</P>
<P>As he pronounced this in loud and pas∣sionate
accents, several ecclesiastics entered
the cloisters, and were passing on to the
body of the church, when his voice arrest∣ed
their attention. They paused, and per∣ceiving
the singular attitude of Schedoni,
and the frantic gesticulations of Vivaldi,
hastily advanced towards them. “For∣bear!”
said one of the strangers, as he seiz∣ed
the cloak of Vivaldi, “do you not ob∣serve!”</P>
<P>“I observe a hypocrite,” replied Vivaldi,
stepping back and disengaging himself, “I
observe a destroyer of the peace, it was his
duty to protect. I”—</P>
<P>“Forbear this desperate conduct,” said
the priest, “lest it provoke the just venge∣ance
<PB N="270" REF="283"/>
of Heaven! Do you not observe the
holy office in which he is engaged?” pointing
to the monk, “Leave the church while you
are permitted to do so in safety; you sus∣pect
not the punishment you may provoke.”</P>
<P>“I will not quit the spot till you answer
my enquiries,” said Vivaldi to Schedoni,
without deigning even to look upon the priest;
“Where, I repeat, is Ellena di Rosalba?”</P>
<P>The confessor was still silent and unmov∣ed.
“This is beyond all patience, and all
belief,” continued Vivaldi. “Speak! An∣swer
me, or dread what I may unfold. Yet
silent! Do you know the convent <HI>del Pian∣to?</HI>
Do you know the confessional of the
<HI>Black Penitents?”</HI></P>
<P>Vivaldi thought he perceived the coun∣tenance
of the monk suffer some change.
“Do you remember that terrible night,”
he added, “when, on the steps of that con∣fessional,
a tale was told?”—</P>
<P>Schedoni raised his eyes, and fixing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them
once more on Vivaldi, with a look that
<PB N="271" REF="284"/>
seemed intended to strike him to the dust,
“Avaunt!” cried he in a tremendous
voice; “avaunt! sacrilegious boy!. Tremble
for the consequence of thy desperate im∣piety!”.</P>
<P>As he concluded, he started from his
position, and gliding, with the silent swift∣ness
of a shadow along the cloister, vanished
in an instant. Vivaldi, when attempting to
pursue him, was seized by the surrounding
monks. Insensible to his sufferings, and
exasperated by his assertions, they threaten∣ed,
that if he did not immediately leave the
convent, he should be confined, and under∣go
the severe punishment to which he had
become liable, for having disturbed and even
insulted one of their holy order while per∣forming
an act of penance.</P>
<P>“He has need of such acts,” said Vivaldi;
“but when can they restore the happiness
his treachery has destroyed? Your order is
disgraced by such a member, reverend fa∣thers;
your”—</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="285"/>
“Peace!” cried a monk, “he is the
pride of our house; he is severe in his de∣votion,
and in self-punishment terrible, be∣yond
the reach of—But I am throwing
away my commendations, I am talking to
one who is not permitted to value or to un∣derstand
the sacred mysteries of our exer∣cises.”</P>
<P>“Away with him to the <HI>Padre Abbate!”</HI>
cried an enraged priest; “away with him
to the dungeon!”</P>
<P>“Away! away!” repeated his compa∣nions,
and they endeavoured to force Vival∣di
through the cloisters. But with the sud∣den
strength which pride and indignation
lent him, he burst from their united hold,
and, quitting the church by another door,
escaped into the street.</P>
<P>Vivaldi returned home in a state of mind
that would have engaged the pity of any
heart, which prejudice or self-interest had
not hardened. He avoided his father, but
sought the Marchesa, who, triumphant in
<PB N="273" REF="286"/>
the success of her plan, was still insensible
to the sufferings of her son.</P>
<P>When the Marchesa had been informed
of his approaching marriage, she had, as
usual, consulted with her confessor on the
means of preventing it, who had advised
the scheme she adopted, a scheme which
was the more easily carried into effect, since
the Marchesa had early in life been ac∣quainted
with the abbess of San Stefano,
and knew, therefore, enough of her cha∣racter
and disposition to confide, without
hesitation, the management of this import∣ant
affair to her discretion. The answer of
the abbess to her proposal, was not merely
acquiescent, but zealous, and it appeared
that she too faithfully justified the confidence
reposed in her. After this plan had been
so successfully prosecuted, it was not to be
hoped that the Marchesa would be pre∣vailed
upon to relinquish it by the tears,
the anguish, or all the varied sufferings of her
son. Vivaldi now reproved the easiness of
<PB N="274" REF="287"/>
his own confidence in having hoped it, and
quitted her cabinet with a despondency that
almost reached despair.</P>
<P>The faithful Paulo obeyed the hasty sum∣mons
of his master, but he had not succeed∣ed
in obtaining intelligence of Ellena; and
Vivaldi, having dismissed him again on the
same enquiry, retired to his apartment,
where the excess of grief, and a feeble hope
of devising some successful mode of re∣medy,
alternately agitated and detained
him.</P>
<P>In the evening, restless and anxious for
change, though scarcely knowing whither
to bend his course, he left the palace, and
strolled down to the sea-beach. A few
fishermen and lazzaroni only were loitering
along the strand, waiting for boats from St.
Lucia. Vivaldi, with folded arms, and his
hat drawn over his face to shade his<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sorrow
from observation, paced the edge of the
waves, listening to their murmur, as they
broke gently at his feet, and gazing upon
<PB N="275" REF="288"/>
their Undulating beauty, while all conscious∣ness
was lost in melancholy reverie con∣cerning
Ellena. Her late residence appear∣ed
at a distance, rising over the shore. He re∣membered
how often, from thence they had
together viewed this lovely scene! Its fea∣tures
had now lost their charm; they were
colourless and uninteresting, or impressed,
only mournful ideas. The sea fluctuating
beneath the setting sun, the long mole and
its light-house tipped with the last rays,
fishermen reposing in the shade, little boats
kimming over the, smooth waters, which
their oars scarcely dimpled; these were
images that brought to his recollection the
affecting evening when he had last seen this
picture from the villa Altieri, when, seated
in the orangery with Ellena and Bianchi, on
the night preceding the death of the latter,
Ellena herself had so solemnly been given
to his care, and had so affectingly consent∣ed
to the dying request of her relative. The
recollection of that scene came to Vivaldi
<PB N="276" REF="289"/>
with all the force of contrast, and renewed
all the anguish of despair; he paced the
beach with quicker steps, and long groans
burst from his heart. He accused himself
of indifference and inactivity, for having
been thus long unable to discover a single
circumstance which might direct his search;
and though he knew not whither to go, he
determined to leave Naples immediately,
and return no more to his father's mansion
till he should have rescued Ellena.</P>
<P>Of some fishermen who were conversing
together upon the beach, he enquired
whether they could accommodate him with
a boat, in which he meant to coast the bay;
for it appeared probable that Ellena had
been conveyed from Altieri by water, to
some town or convent on the shore, the
privacy and facility of such a mode of con∣veyance
being suitable to the designs of her
enemies.</P>
<P>“I have but one boat, Signor,” said a
fisherman, “and that is busy enough in go∣ing
<PB N="277" REF="290"/>
to and fro between here and Santa
Lucia, but my comrade, here, perhaps can
serve you. What, Carlo, can you help
the Signor to your little-skiff? the other,
I know, has enough to do in the trade.”</P>
<P>His comrade, however, was too much
engaged with a party of three or four men,
who were listening in deep attention
round him, to reply; Vivaldi advancing to
urge the question, was struck by the eager∣ness
with which he delivered his narrative,
as well as the uncouthness of his gesticula∣tion;
and he paused a moment in attention.
One of the auditors seemed to doubt of
something that had been asserted. “I tell
you,” replied the narrator, “I used to
carry fish there, two and three times a
week, and very good fort of people they
were; they have laid out many a ducat
with me in their time. But as I was say∣ing,
when I got there, and knocked upon
the door, I heard, all of a sudden, a huge
groaning, and presently I heard the voice
<PB N="278" REF="291"/>
of the old housekeeper herself, roaring out
for help; but I could give her none, for
the door was fastened; and, while I ran
away for assistance to old Bartoli, you know
old Bartoli, he lives by the road side as you
go to Naples; well, while I ran to him,
comes a Signor, and jumps through the
window and sets her at liberty at once. So
then, I heard the whole story.”—</P>
<P>“What story?” said Vivaldi, “and of
whom do you speak?”</P>
<P>“All in good time, <HI>Maestro,</HI> you shall
hear,” said the fisherman, who looking at
him for a moment, added, “Why, Signor,
it should be you I saw there, you should be
the very Signor that let Beatrice loose.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who had scarcely doubted be∣fore,
that it was Altieri of which the man
had spoken, now asked a thousand questions
respecting the route the ruffians had taken
Ellena, but obtained no relief to his anx∣iety.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="292"/>
“I should not wonder,” said, a Lazzaro
Who had been listening to the relation; “I
should not wonder if the carriage that pass∣ed
Bracelli early on the same morning, with
the blinds drawn up, though it was so hot
that people could scarcely breathe in the
open air, should prove to be it which carried
off the lady!”</P>
<P>This hint was sufficient to reanimate Vi∣valdi,
who collected all the information the
Lazzaro could give, which was, however,
little more than that a carriage, such as he
described, had been seen by him, driving
furiously through Bracelli, early on the
morning mentioned as that of Signora di
Rosalba's departure. Vivaldi had now no
doubt as to its being the one which, con∣veyed
her away, and he determined to set
out immediately for that place, where he
hoped to obtain from the post-master fur∣ther
intelligence concerning the road she
had pursued.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="293"/>
With this intention he returned once
more to his father's mansion, not to ac∣quaint
him with his purpose, or to bid him
farewel, but to await the return of his
servant Paulo, who he meant should ac∣company
him in the search. Vivaldi's
spirits were now animated with hope, slen∣der
as were the circumstances that support∣ed
it; and, believing his design to be wholly
unsuspected by those who would be dis∣posed
to interrupt it, he did not guard either
against the measures, which might impede
his departure from Naples, or those which
might overtake him on his journey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<Q>“What, would'st thou have a serpent sting thee
twice?” <BIBL>SHAKESPEAR.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE Marchesa, alarmed at some hints
dropped by Vivaldi in the late interview
between them, and by some circumstances
of his latter conduct, summoned her con∣stant
adviser, Schedoni. Still suffering with
the insult he had received in the church of
the <HI>Spirito Santo,</HI> he obeyed with sullen re∣luctance,
yet not without a malicious hope
of discovering some opportunity for retalia∣tion.
That insult, which had pointed forth
his hypocrisy, and ridiculed the solemn ab∣straction
he assumed, had sunk deep in his
heart, and, fermenting the direst passions of
his nature, he meditated a terrible revenge.
It had subjected him to mortifications of
<PB N="282" REF="295"/>
various kinds. Ambition, it has already
appeared, was one of his strongest motives
of action, and he had long since assumed
a character of severe sanctity, chiefly for the
purposes of lifting him to promotion. He
was not beloved in the society of which he
was a member; and many of the brother∣hood,
who had laboured to disappoint his
views, and to detect his errors, who hated
him for his pride, and envied him for his
reputed sanctity, now gloried in the morti∣fication
he had received, and endeavoured
to turn the circumstance to their own ad∣vantage.
They had not scrupled already
to display by insinuation and pointed sneers,
their triumph, and to menace his reputa∣tion;
and Schedoni, though he deserved
contempt, was not of a temper to endure
it.</P>
<P>But above all, some hints respecting his
past life, which had fallen from Vivaldi, and
which occasioned him so abruptly to leave
the church, alarmed him. So much terror,
<PB N="283" REF="296"/>
indeed, had they excited, that it is not im∣probable
that he would have sealed his
secret in death, devoting Vivaldi to the grave,
had he not been restrained by the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaded
vengeance of the Vivaldi, family. Since
that hour he had known no peace, and had
never slept; he had taken scarcely any
food, and was almost continually on his
knees upon the steps of the high altar. The
devotees who beheld him, paused and ad∣mired;
such of the brothers as disliked
him, sneered and passed on. Schedoni ap∣peared
alike insensible to each; lost to this
world, and preparing for a higher.</P>
<P>The torments of his mind and the severe
penance he had observed, had produced a
surprising change in his appearance, so that
he resembled a spectre rather, than a human
being. His visage was wan and wasted,
his, eyes were sunk and become nearly mo∣tionless,
and his whole air and attitudes ex∣hibited
the wild energy of something—not
of this earth.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="297"/>
When he was summoned by the Mar∣chesa,
his conscience whispered this to be
the consequence of circumstances, which
Vivaldi had revealed; and, at first, he had
determined not to attend her; but, consi∣dering
that if it was so, his refusal would
confirm suspicion, he resolved to trust once
more to the subtilty of his address for de∣liverance.</P>
<P>With these apprehensions, tempered by
this hope, he entered the Marchesa's closet.
She almost started on observing him, and
could not immediately withdraw her eyes
from his altered visage, while Schedoni was
unable wholly to conceal the perturbation
which such earnest observation occasioned.
“Peace rest with you, daughter!” said he,
and he seated himself, without lifting his
eyes from the floor.</P>
<P>“I wished to speak with you, father,
upon affairs of moment,” said the Marchesa
gravely, “which are probably not unknown
to you.” She paused, and Schedoni bowed
<PB N="285" REF="298"/>
his head, awaiting in anxious expectation
what was to follow.</P>
<P>“You are silent, father,” resumed the
Marchesa. “What am I to understand by
this?</P>
<P>“That you have been misinformed,”
replied Schedoni, whose apt conscience be∣trayed
his discretion.</P>
<P>“Pardon me,” said the Marchesa, “I am
too well informed, and should not have re∣quested
your visit if any doubt had remain∣ed
upon my mind.”</P>
<P>“Signora! be cautious of what you
credit,” said the confessor imprudently;
“you know not the consequence of a hasty
credulity.”</P>
<P>“Would that mine were a rash credu∣lity!”
replied the Marchesa; “but—we are
betrayed.”</P>
<P><HI>“We?”</HI> repeated the monk, beginning to
revive: “What has happened?”</P>
<P>The Marchesa informed him of Vivaldi's
absence, and inferred from its length, for
<PB N="286" REF="299"/>
it was now several days since his departure,
that he had certainly discovered the place of
Ellena's confinement, as well as the authors,
of it.</P>
<P>Schedoni differed from her, but hinted,
that the obedience of youth was hopeless,
unless severer measures were adopted.</P>
<P>“Severer!” exclaimed the Marchesa;
“good father, is it not severe enough' to
confine her for life?”</P>
<P>“I mean severer with respect to your
son, lady,” replied Schedoni. “When a
young man has so far overcome all reve∣rence
for an holy ordinance as publicly to
insult its professors, and yet more, when
that professor is in the very performance of
his duties, it is time he should be control∣led
with a strong hand. I am not in the
practice of advising such measures, but the
conduct of Signor Vivaldi is such as calls
aloud for them. Public decency demands
it. For myself, indeed, I should have en∣dured
patiently the indignity which has
<PB N="287" REF="300"/>
been offered me, receiving it as a salutary
mortification, as one of those inflictions that
purify the soul from the pride which even
the holiest men may unconsciously cherish.
But I am no longer permitted to consider
myself; the public good requires that an
example should be made of the horrible
impiety of which your son, it grieves
me, daughter, to disclose it!—your son,
unworthy of such a mother! has been
guilty.”</P>
<P>It is evident that in the style, at least, of
this accusation, Schedoni suffered the force
of his resentment to prevail over the usual
subtilty of his address, the deep and smooth
insinuation of his policy.</P>
<P>“To what do you allude, righteous fa∣ther?”
enquired the astonished Marchesa;
“what indignity, what impiety has my son
to answer for? I entreat you will speak
explicitly, that I may prove I can lose the
mother in the strict severity of the judge.”</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="301"/>
“That is spoken with the grandeur of
sentiment, which has always distinguished
you, my daughter! Strong minds perceive
that justice is the highest of the moral at∣tributes,
mercy is only the favourite of
weak ones.”</P>
<P>Schedoni had a view in this commenda∣tion
beyond that of confirming the Marche∣sa's
present resolution against Vivaldi. He
wished to prepare her for measures, which
might hereafter be necessary to accomplish
the revenge he meditated, and he knew
that by flattering her vanity, he was most
likely to succeed. He praised her, therefore,
for qualities he wished her to possess, en∣couraged
her to reject general opinions
by admiring as the symptoms of a superior
understanding, the convenient morality
upon which she had occasionally acted;
and, calling sternness justice, extolled that
for strength of mind, which was only callous
insensibility.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="302"/>
He then described to her Vivaldi's late
conduct in the church of the <HI>Spirito Santo,</HI>
exaggerated some offensive circumstances of
it, invented others, and formed of the whole
an instance of monstrous impiety and un∣provoked
insult.</P>
<P>The Marchesa listened to the relation
with no less indignation than surprize, and
her readiness to adopt the confessor's advice
allowed him to depart with renovated spirits
and most triumphant hopes.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Marchese remained ig∣norant
of the subject of the conference
with Schedoni. His opinions had formerly
been sounded, and having been found de∣cidedly
against the dark policy it was
thought expedient to practise, he was never
afterwards consulted respecting Vivaldi.
Parental anxiety and affection began to re∣vive
as the lengthened absence of his son
was observed. Though jealous of his rank,
he loved Vivaldi; and, though he had never
positively believed that he designed to enter
<PB N="290" REF="303"/>
into a sacred engagement with a person,
whom the Marchese considered to be so
much his inferior as Ellena, he had suffer∣ed
doubts, which gave him considerable
uneasiness. The present extraordinary ab∣sence
of Vivaldi renewed his alarm. He
apprehended that if she was discovered at
this moment, when the fear of losing her
for ever, and the exasperation, which such
complicated opposition occasioned, had
awakened all the passions of his son, this rash
young man might be prevailed upon to
secure her for his own by the indissoluble
vow. On the other hand, he dreaded the
effect of Vivaldi's despair, should he fail
in the pursuit; and thus, fearing at one
moment that for which he wished in the
next, the Marchese suffered a tumult of
mind inferior only to his son's.</P>
<P>The instructions, which he delivered to
the servants whom he sent in pursuit of Vi∣valdi,
were given under such distraction of
thought, that scarcely any person perfectly
<PB N="291" REF="304"/>
understood his commission; and, as the
Marchesa had been careful to conceal from
him her knowledge of Ellena's abode, he
gave no direction concerning the route to
<HI>San Stefano.</HI></P>
<P>While the Marchese at Naples was thus
employed, and while Schedoni was form∣ing
further plans against Ellena, Vivaldi
was wandering from village to village, and
from town to town, in pursuit of her, whom
all his efforts had hitherto been unsuccess∣ful
to recover. From the people at the
post-house at Bracelli, he had obtained
little information that could direct him;
they only knew that a carriage, such as had
been already described to Vivaldi, with the
blinds drawn up, changed horses there on
the morning, which he remembered to be
that of Ellena's departure, and had pro∣ceeded
on the road to Morgagni.</P>
<P>When Vivaldi arrived thither, all trace
of Ellena was lost; the master of the post
could not recollect a single circumstance
<PB N="292" REF="305"/>
connected with the travellers, and, even if
he had noticed them, it would have been
insufficient for Vivaldi's purpose, unless he
had also observed the road they followed;
for at this place several roads branched off
into opposite quarters of the country; Vi∣valdi,
therefore, was reduced to chuse one
of these, as chance or fancy directed; and,
as it appeared probable that the Marchesa
had conveyed Ellena to a convent, he de∣termined
to make enquiries at every one
on his way.</P>
<P>He had now passed over some of the
wildest tracts of the Apennine, among
scenes, which seemed abandoned by civiliz∣ed
society to the banditti who haunted their
recesses. Yet even here amidst wilds that
were nearly inaccessible, convents, with
each its small dependent hamlet, were scat∣tered,
and, shrouded from the world by
woods and mountains, enjoyed unsuspect∣edly
many of its luxuries, and displayed,
unnoticed, some of its elegance. Vivaldi,
<PB N="293" REF="306"/>
who had visited several of these in
search of Ellena, had been surprized at the refined
courtesy and hospitality, with which he was
received.</P>
<P>It was on the seventh day of his journey,
and near sun-set, that he was bewildered in
the woods of Rugieri. He had received a
direction for the road he was to take at a
village some leagues distant, and had obey∣ed
it confidently till now, when the path
was lost in several tracts that branched out
among the trees. The day was closing,
and Vivaldi's spirits began to fail, but
Paulo, light of heart and ever gay, com∣mended
the shade and pleasant freshness of
the woods, and observed, that if his mas∣ter
did lose his way, and was obliged to
remain here for the night, it could not be
so very unlucky, for they could climb up
among the branches of a chestnut, and find
a more neat and airy lodging than any inn
had yet afforded them.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="307"/>
While Paulo was thus endeavouring to
make the best of what might happen, and
his master was sunk in reverie, they sudden∣ly
heard the sound of instruments and voices
from a distance. The gloom, which the
trees threw around, prevented their dis∣tinguishing
objects afar off, and not a single
human being was visible, nor any trace of
his art, beneath the shadowy scene. They
listened to ascertain from what direction
the sounds approached, and heard a chorus
of voices, accompanied by a few instru∣ments,
performing the evening service.</P>
<P>“We are near a convent, Signor,” said
Paulo, “listen! they are at their devo∣tions.”</P>
<P>“It is as you say,” replied Vivaldi; “and
we will make the best of our way towards
it.”</P>
<P>“Well, Signor! I must say, if we find as
good doings here as we had at the Capu∣chin's,
we shall have no reason to regret
<PB N="295" REF="308"/>
our beds <HI>al-fresco</HI> among the chestnut
branches.”</P>
<P>“Do you perceive any walls or spires be∣yond
the trees?” said Vivaldi, as he led the
way.</P>
<P>“None, Signor,” replied Paulo; “yet
we draw nearer the sounds. Ah, Signor!
do you hear that note? How it dies away!
And those instruments just touched in sym∣phony!
This is not the music of peasants;
a convent must be near, though we do not
see it.”</P>
<P>Still as they advanced, no walls appeared.
and soon after the music ceased; but other
sounds led Vivaldi forward to a pleasant
part of the woods, where, the trees open∣ing,
he perceived a party of pilgrims seated
on the grass. They were laughing and
conversing with much gaiety, as each spread
before him the supper, which he drew from
his scrip; while he, who appeared to be the
<HI>Father-director</HI> of the pilgrimage, sat with a
jovial countenance in the midst of the com∣pany,
<PB N="296" REF="309"/>
dispensing jokes and merry stories,
and receiving in return a tribute from every
scrip. Wines of various sorts were rang∣ed
before him, of which he drank abund∣antly,
and seemed not to refuse any dainty
that was offered.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, whose apprehensions were now
quieted, stopped to observe the groupe, as
the evening rays, glancing along the skirts
of the wood, threw a gleam upon their va∣rious
countenances, shewing, however, in
each a spirit of gaiety that might have cha∣racterized
the individuals of a party of plea∣sure,
rather than those of a pilgrimage.
The <HI>Father-director</HI> and his flock seemed
perfectly to understand each other; the
Superior willingly resigned the solemn au∣sterity
of his office, and permitted the com∣pany
to make themselves as happy as pos∣sible,
in consideration of receiving plenty of
the most delicate of their viands; yet some∣what
of dignity was mingled with his con∣descensions,
that compelled them to receive
<PB N="297" REF="310"/>
even his jokes with a degree of deference,
and perhaps they laughed at them less for
their spirit than because they were favors.</P>
<P>Addressing the Superior, Vivaldi request∣ed
to be directed how he might regain his
way. The father examined him for a mo∣ment
before he replied, but observing the
elegance of his dress, and a certain air of
distinction; and perceiving, also, that
Paulo was his servant, he promised his ser∣vices,
and invited him to take a seat at his
right hand, and partake of the supper.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, understanding that the party
was going his road, accepted the invita∣tion;
when Paulo, having fastened the
horses to a tree, soon became busy with the
supper. While Vivaldi conversed with the
father, Paulo engrossed all the attention of
the pilgrims near him; they declared he
was the cleverest and the merriest fellow
they had ever seen, and often expressed a
wish that he was going as far with them as
to the shrine in a convent of Carmelites,
<PB N="298" REF="311"/>
which terminated their pilgrimage. When
Vivaldi understood that this shrine was in
the church of a convent, partly inhabited
by nuns, and that it was little more than
a league and a half distant, he determined
to accompany them, for it was as possible
that Ellena was confined there as in any
other cloister; and of her being imprisoned
in some convent, he had less doubt, the
more he considered the character and views
of his mother. He set forward, therefore,
with the pilgrims, and on foot, having re∣signed
his horse to the weary <HI>Father-di∣rector.</HI></P>
<P>Darkness closed over them long before
they reached the village where they design∣ed
to pass the night; but they beguiled
the way with songs and stories, now and
then, only, stopping at command of the
Father, to repeat some prayer or sing a
hymn. But, as they drew near a village,
at the base of the mountain on which the
shrine stood, they halted to arrange them∣selves
<PB N="299" REF="312"/>
in procession; and the Superior hav∣ing
stopped short in the midst of one of
his best jokes, dismounted Vivaldi's horse,
placed himself at their head, and beginning
a loud strain, they proceeded in full chorus
of melancholy music.</P>
<P>The peasants, hearing their sonorous
voices, came forth to meet and conduct
them to their cabins. The village was al∣ready
crowded with devotees, but these
poor peasants, looking up to them with
love and reverence, made every possible
contrivance to accommodate all who came;
notwithstanding which, when Paulo soon
after turned into his bed of straw, he had
more reasons than one to regret his chestnut
mattress.</P>
<P>Vivaldi passed an anxious night, waiting
impatiently for the dawning of that day,
which might possibly restore to him Ellena.
Considering that a pilgrim's habit would
not only conceal him from suspicion, but
allow him opportunities for observation,
<PB N="300" REF="313"/>
which his own dress would not permit, he
employed Paulo to provide him one. The
address of the servant, assisted by a single
ducat, easily procured it, and at an early
hour he set forward on his enquiry.</P>

<L>Of our faintly sister.</L></Q>
<P>A FEW devotees only had begun to
ascend the mountain, and Vivaldi kept aloof
even from these, pursuing a lonely track,
for his thoughtful mind desired solitude.
The early breeze sighing among the foli∣age,
that waved high over the path, and
the hollow dashing of distant waters, he
listened to with complacency, for these were
sounds which soothed yet promoted his
melancholy mood; and he sometimes rested
to gaze upon the scenery around him, for
this too was in harmony with the temper
of his mind. Disappointment had subdued
the wilder energy of the passions, and pro∣duced
<PB N="302" REF="315"/>
a solemn and lofty state of feeling;
he viewed with pleasing sadness the dark
rocks and precipices, the gloomy mountains
and vast solitudes, that spread around him;
nor was the convent he was approaching
a less sacred feature of the scene, as its gray
walks and pinnacles appeared beyond the
dusky groves. “Ah! if it should enclose
her!” said Vivaldi, as he caught a first
glimpse of its hall. “Vain hope! I will not
invite your illusions again, I will not ex∣pose
myself to the agonies of new disappoint∣ment;
I will search, but not expect. Yet,
if she should be there!”</P>
<P>Having reached the gates of the convent,
he passed with hasty steps into the court;
where his emotion encreased as he paused a
moment and looked round its silent cloisters.
The porter only appeared, when
Vivaldi, fearful lest he should perceive him
not to be a pilgrim, drew his hood over his
face, and, gathering up his garments still
closer in his folded arms, passed on without
<PB N="303" REF="316"/>
speaking, though he knew not which of the
avenues before him led to the shrine. He
advanced, however, towards the church, a
stately edifice, detached, and at some little
distance, from the other parts of the con∣vent.
Its highly vaulted aisles, extending in
twilight perspective, where a monk, or a
pilgrim only, now and then crossed, whose
dark figures, passing without sound, vanish∣ed
like shadows; the universal stillness of
the place, the gleam of tapers from the high
altar, and of lamps, which gave a gloomy
pomp to every shrine in the church:—all
these circumstances conspired to impress a
sacred awe upon his heart.</P>
<P>He followed some devotees through a
side aisle to a court, that was overhung by
a tremendous rock, in which was a cave, con∣taining
the shrine of <HI>our Lady of Mount Car∣mel.</HI>
This-court was enclosed by the rock,
and by the choir of the church, except that
to the south a small opening led the eye
to a glimpse of the landscape below, which,
seen beyond the dark jaws of the cliff, ap∣peared
<PB N="304" REF="317"/>
free, and light, and gaily coloured,
melting away into the blue and distant
mountains.</P>
<P>Vivaldi entered the cave, where, enclosed
within a filigree screen of gold, lay the image
of the saint, decorated with flowers and
lighted up by innumerable lamps and tapers.
The steps of the shrine were thronged with
kneeling pilgrims, and Vivaldi, to avoid
singularity, kneeled also; till a high peal of
the organ, at a distance, and the deep voices
of choiristers announced that the first mass
was begun. He left the cave, and, return∣ing
into the church, loitered at an extremity
of the aisles, where he listened awhile to
the solemn harmony pealing along the roofs,
and softening away in distance. It was such
full and entrancing music as frequently
swells in the high festivals of the Sicilian
church, and is adapted to inspire that sub∣lime
enthusiasm, which sometimes elevates
its disciples. Vivaldi, unable to endure
long the excess of feeling, which this har∣mony
<PB N="305" REF="318"/>
awakened, was leaving the church,
when suddenly it ceased, and the tolling of
a bell sounded in its stead. This seemed to
be the knel of death, and it occurred to
him, that a dying person was approaching
to receive the last sacrament; when he
head remotely a warbling of female voices,
mingling with the deeper tones of the
monks, and with the hollow note of the
bell, as it struck at intervals. So sweetly,
so plaintively, did the strain grow on the
air, that those, who listened, as well as those,
who sung, were touched with sorrow, and
seemed equally to mourn for a departing
friend.</P>
<P>Vivaldi hastened to the choir, the pave∣ment
of which was strewn with palm-branches
and fresh flowers. A pall of black
velvet lay upon the steps of the altar, where
several priests were silently attending. Every
where appeared the ensigns of solemn pomp
and ceremony, and in every countenance
the stillness and observance of expectation.
<PB N="306" REF="319"/>
Meanwhile the sounds drew nearer, and
Vivaldi perceived a procession of nuns ap∣proaching
from a distant aisle.</P>
<P>As they advanced, he distinguished the
lady abbess leading the train, dressed in her
pontifical robes, with the mitre on her head;
and well he marked her stately step, mov∣ing
in time to the slow minstrelsy, and
the air of proud yet graceful dignity, with
which she characterized herself. Then fol∣lowed
the nuns, according to their se∣veral
orders, and last came the novices,
carrying lighted tapers, and surrounded by
other nuns, who were distinguished by a
particular habit.</P>
<P>Having reached a part of the church ap∣propriated
for their reception, they arranged
themselves in order. Vivaldi with a pal∣pitating
heart enquired the occasion of this
ceremony, and was told that a nun was
going to be professed.</P>
<P>“You are informed, no doubt, brother,”
added the prior who gave him this intelli∣gence,
<PB N="307" REF="320"/>
“that on the morning of our high
festival, our <HI>lady's</HI> day, it is usual for such
as devote themselves to heaven, to receive
the veil. Stand bye a while, and you will
see the ceremony.”</P>
<P>“What is the name of the novice who
is now to receive it?” said Vivaldi, in a voice
whose tremulous accents betrayed his emo∣tion.</P>
<P>The friar glanced an eye of scrutiny
upon him, as he replied, “I know not her
name, but if you will step a little this way,
I will point her out to you.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, drawing his hood over his face,
obeyed in silence.</P>
<P>“It is she on the right of the abbess,”
said the stranger, “who leans on the arm
of a nun, she is covered with a white veil,
and is taller than her companions.”</P>
<P>Vivaldi, observed her with a fearful eye,
and, though he did not recognize the per∣son
of Ellena, yet, whether it was that his
fancy was possessed with her image, or that
<PB N="308" REF="321"/>
there was truth in his surmise, he thought
he perceived a resemblance of her. He en∣quired
how long the novice had resided in
the convent, and many other particulars,
to which the stranger either could not or
dared not reply.</P>
<P>With what anxious solicitude did Vi∣valdi
endeavour to look through the veils
of the several nuns in search of Ellena,
whom he believed the barbarous policy of
his mother might already have devoted to
the cloister! With a solicitude still stronger,
he tried to catch a glimpse of the features of
the novices, but their faces were shaded by
hoods, and their white veils, though thrown
half back, were disposed in such artful folds
that they concealed them from observation,
as effectually as did the pendant lawn the
features of the nuns.</P>
<P>The ceremony began with the exhorta∣tion
of the <HI>Father-Abbot,</HI> delivered with
solemn energy; then the novice kneeling
before him, made her profession, for which
<PB N="309" REF="322"/>
Vivaldi listened with intense attention, but
it was delivered in such low and trembling
accents, that he could not ascertain even
the tone. But during the anthem that
mingled with the ensuing part of the ser∣vice,
he thought he distinguished the voice
of Ellena, that touching and well-known
voice, which in the church of San Lorenzo
had first attracted his attention. He listen∣ed,
scarcely daring to draw breath, lest he
should lose a note; and again he fancied
her voice spoke in a part of the plaintive re∣sponse
delivered by the nuns.</P>
<P>Vivaldi endeavoured to command his
emotion, and to await with patience some
further unfolding of the truth; but when
the priest prepared to withdraw the white
veil from the face of the novice, and throw
the black one over her, a dreadful expect∣ation
that she was Ellena seized him, and
he with difficulty forbore stepping forward
and discovering himself on the instant.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="323"/>
The veil was at length withdrawn, and
a very lovely face appeared, but not El∣lena's.
Vivaldi breathed again, and waited
with tolerable composure for the conclu∣sion
of the ceremony; till, in the solemn
strain that followed the putting on of the
black veil, he heard again the voice, which
he was now convinced was her's. Its ac∣cents
were low, and mournful, and tremu∣lous,
yet his heart, acknowledged instanta∣neously
their magic influence.</P>
<P>When this ceremony had concluded,
another began; and he was told it was that
of a noviciation. A young woman, sup∣ported
by two nuns, advanced to the altar,
and Vivaldi thought he beheld Ellena. The
priest was beginning the customary exhort∣ation,
when she lifted her half-veil, and,
shewing a countenance where meek sorrow
was mingled with heavenly sweetness, rais∣ed
her blue eyes, all bathed in tears, and
waved her hand as if she would have spoken.—It
was Ellena herself.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="324"/>
The priest attempted to proceed.</P>
<P>“I protest in the presence of this con∣gregation,”
said she solemnly, “that I am
brought hither to pronounce vows which
my heart, disclaims. I protest”—</P>
<P>A confusion of voices interrupted her,
and at the same instant she perceived Vival∣di
rushing towards the altar. Ellena gazed
for a moment, and then, stretching forth
her supplicating hands towards him, closed
her eyes, and sunk into the arms of some
persons round her, who vainly endeavoured
to prevent him from approaching and as∣sisting
her. The anguish, with which he
bent over her lifeless form, and called upon
her name, excited the commiseration even
of the nuns, and especially of Olivia, who
was most assiduous in efforts to revive her
young friend.</P>
<P>When Ellena unclosed her eyes, and
looking up, once more beheld Vivaldi, the
expression, with which she regarded him,
told that her heart was unchanged, and
<PB N="312" REF="325"/>
that she was unconscious of the miseries of
imprisonment while he was with her. She
desired to withdraw, and, assisted by Vival∣di
and Olivia, was leaving the church,
when the abbess ordered that she should be
attended by the nuns only; and, retiring
from the altar, she gave directions that the
young stranger should be conducted to the
parlour of the convent.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, though he refused to obey an
imperious command, yielded to the entrea∣ties
of Ellena, and to the gentle remon∣strances
of Olivia; and, bidding Ellena fare∣well
for a while, he repaired to the parlour
of the abbess. He was not without some
hope of awakening her to a sense of justice,
or of pity; but he found that her notions
of right were inexorably against him, and
that pride and resentment usurped the in∣fluence
of every other feeling. She began
her lecture with expressing the warm friend∣ship
she had so long cherished for the Mar∣chesa,
proceeded to lament that the son of
<PB N="313" REF="326"/>
a friend, whom she so highly esteemed,
should have forgotten his duty to his pa∣rents,
and the observance due to the dig∣nity
of his house, so far as to seek connec∣tion
with a person of Ellena di Rosalba's
inferior station; and concluded with a severe
reprimand for having disturbed the tran∣quillity
of her convent and the decorum of
the church by has intrusion.</P>
<P>Vivaldi listened with submitting patience
to this mention of morals and, decorum
from a person, who, with the most perfect
self-applause, was violating some of the
plainest obligations of humanity and justice;
who had conspired to tear an orphan from
her home, and who designed to deprive her
for life of liberty, with all the blessings it
inherits. But, when she proceeded to speak
of Ellena with the caustic of severe repro∣bation,
and to hint at the punishment, which
her public rejection of the vows had incur∣red,
the patience of Vivaldi submitted no
longer; indignation and contempt rose
<PB N="314" REF="327"/>
high against the Superior, and he exhibited
a portrait of herself in the strong colours of
truth. But the mind, which compassion
could not persuade, reason could not appal;
selfishness Had hardened it alike to the in∣fluence
of each; her pride only was affect∣ed,
and she retaliated the mortification she
suffered by menace and denunciation.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, on quitting her apartment, had
no other resource than an application to
the <HI>Abate,</HI> whose influence, it least, if not
his authority, might assuage the severity of
her power. In this Abate, a mildness of
temper, and a gentleness of manner were
qualities of less value than is usually and
deservedly imputed to them; for, being
connected with feebleness of mind, they
were but the pleasing merits of easy times,
which in an hour of difficulty never assum∣ed
the character of virtues, by inducing
him to serve those, for whom he might feel.
And thus, with a temper and disposition
directly opposite to those of the severe and
<PB N="315" REF="328"/>
violent abbess, he was equally selfish, and
almost equally culpable, since by permiting
evil, he was nearly as injurious in his con∣duct
as those who planned it. Indolence
and timidity, a timidity the consequence of
want of clear perception, deprived him of
all energy of character; he was prudent
rather than wise, and so fearful of being
thought to do wrong that he seldom did right.</P>
<P>To Vivaldi's temperate representations
and earnest entreaties that he would exert
some authority towards liberating Ellena,
he listened with patience; acknowledged the
hardships of her situation; lamented the un∣happy
divisions between Vivaldi and his
family, and then declined advancing a
single step in so delicate an affair. Signora
di Rosalba, he said, was in the care of the
abbess, over whom he had no right of con∣trol
in matters relative to her domestic
concerns. Vivaldi then supplicated, that,
though he possessed no authority, he would,
at least, intercede or remonstrate against so
<PB N="316" REF="329"/>
unjust a procedure as that of detaining Ellena a prisoner, and assist in restoring her
to the home, from which she had been for∣cibly
carried.</P>
<P>“And this, again,” replied the Abate,
does not come within my jurisdiction;
and I make it a rule never to encroach upon
that of another person.”</P>
<P>“And can you endure, holy father,”
said Vivaldi, “to witness a flagrant act of
injustice and not endeavour to counteract
it? not even step forward to rescue the vic∣tim
when you perceive the preparation for
the sacrifice?”</P>
<P>“I repeat, that I never interfere with
the authority of others,” replied the Supe∣rior;
“having asserted my own, I yield to
them in their sphere, the obedience which
I require in mine.”</P>
<P>“Is power then,” said Vivaldi, “the in∣fallible
test of justice? Is it morality to
obey where the command is criminal? The
whole world have a claim upon the forti∣tude,
<PB N="317" REF="330"/>
the active fortitude of those who are
placed as you are, between the alternative
of confirming a wrong by your consent, or
preventing it by your resistance. Would
that your heart expanded towards that
world, reverend father!”</P>
<P>“Would that the whole world were
wrong that you might have the glory of
setting it right!” said the Abate, smiling.
“Young man! you are an enthusiast, and
I pardon you. You are a knight of chi∣valry,
who would go about the earth fight∣ing
with every body by way of proving
your right to do good; it is unfortunate
that you are born somewhat too late.”</P>
<P>“Enthusiasm in the cause of humanity”—said
Vivaldi, but he checked himself; and
despairing of touching a heart so hardened
by selfish prudence, and indigna<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at be∣holding
an apathy so vicious in its consequence,
he left the Abate without other ef∣fort.
He perceived that he must now have re∣course
to further stratagem, a recourse which
<PB N="318" REF="331"/>
his frank and noble mind detested, but he
had already tried, without success, every
other possibility of rescuing the innocent vic∣tim
of the Marchesa's prejudice and pride.</P>
<P>Ellena meanwhile had retired to her cell,
agitated by a variety of considerations, and
contrary emotions, of which, however,
those of joy and tenderness were long
predominant. Then came anxiety, appre∣hension,
pride, and doubt, to divide and
torture her heart. It was true that Vivaldi
had discovered her prison, but, if it were
possible, that he could release her, she must
consent to quit it with him; a step from
which a mind so tremblingly jealous of pro∣priety
as hers, recoiled with alarm, though
it would deliver her from captivity. And
how, when she considered the haughty
character of the Marchese di Vivaldi, the
imperious and vindictive nature of the
Marchesa, and, still more, their united repug∣nance
to a connection with her, how could
she endure to think, even for a moment, of
<PB N="319" REF="332"/>
intruding herself into such a family! Pride,
delicacy, good sense seemed to warn her
against a conduct so humiliating and vexa∣tious
in its consequences, and to exhort her to
preserve her own dignity by independence;
but the esteem, the friendship, the tender affection, which she had cherished for Vivaldi,
made her pause, and shrink with emotions,
of little lese than horror, from the eternal
renunciation, which so dignified a choice
required. Though the encouragements,
which her deceased relative had given to
this attachment, seemed to impart to it a
sacred character, that considerably soothed
the alarmed delicacy of Ellena, the appro∣bation
thus implied, had no power to silence
her own objections, and she would have
regretted the mistaken zeal, which had con∣tributed
to lead her into the present distress∣ing
situation, had she revered the memory
of her aunt, or loved Vivaldi, less. Still,
however, the joy, which his presence had
occasioned, and which the consciousness
<PB N="320" REF="333"/>
that he was still near her had prolonged,
was not sabdued, though it was frequently
obscured, by such anxious considerations.
With jealous and indiscreet solicitude, she
now recollected every look, and the accent
of every word, which had told that his affec∣tion
was undiminished, thus seeking, with
inconsistent zeal, for a conviction of the
very tendernes, which but a moment before
she had thought it would be prudent to la∣ment,
and almost necessary to renounce.</P>
<P>She awaited with extreme anxiety the ap∣pearance
of Olivia, who might probably
know the result the Vivaldi's conference
with the abbess, and whether he was yet in
the convent.</P>
<P>In the evening Olivia came, a messenger
of evil; and Ellena, informed of the con∣duct
of the abbess, and the consequent de∣parture
of Vivaldi, perceived all her
courage, and all the half-formed resolutions,
which a consideration of his family had
suggested, faulter and expire. Sensible
<PB N="321" REF="334"/>
only of grief and despondency, she ascer∣tained,
for the first time, the extent of
her affection and the severity of her situa∣tion.
She perceived, also, that the injustice,
which his family had exercised towards her,
absolved her from all consideration of
their displeasure, otherwise than as it might
affect herself; but this was a conviction,
which it were now probably useless to admit.</P>
<P>Olivia not only expressed the tenderest
interest in her welfare, but seemed deeply
affected with her situation; and, whether
it was, that the nun's misfortunes bore some
resemblance to Ellena's, or from whatever
cause, it is remarkable that her eyes were
often filled with tears, while she regarded
her young friend, and she betrayed so much
emotion that Ellena noticed it with surprise.
She was, however, too delicate to hint any
curiosity on the subject; and too much en∣gaged
by a nearer interest, to dwell long
upon the circumstance.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="335"/>
When Olivia withdrew, Ellena retired
to her turret, soothe her spirits with a view
of serene and majestic nature, a recourse
which seldom failed to elevate her mind and
soften the asperities of affliction. It was to
her like sweet and solemn music, breathing
peace over the soul—like the oaten stop of
Milton's Spirit,
<Q><L>“Who with his soft pipe, and smooth-dittied song,</L>
<L>Well knew to still the wild winds when they roar</L>
<L>And hush the waving woods.”</L></Q></P>
<P>While she sat before a window, observing
the evening light beaming up the valley,
and touching all the distant mountains with
misty purple, a reed as sweet, though not as
fanciful, sounded from among the rocks
below. The instrument and the character
of the strain were such as she had been un∣accustomed
to hear within the walls of San
Stefano, and the tone diffused over her spirits
a pleasing melancholy, that rapt all her at∣tention.
The liquid cadence, as it trembled
and sunk away, seemed to tell the dejection
<PB N="323" REF="336"/>
of no vulgar feelings, and the exquisite taste,
with which the complaining notes were
again swelled, almost convinced her, that
the musician was Vivaldi.</P>
<P>On looking from the lattice, she perceiv∣ed
a person perched on a point of the cliff be∣low,
whither it appeared almost impracticable
for any human step to have climbed, and pre∣served
from the precipice only by some dwarf
shrubs that fringed the brow. The twilight
did not permit her immediately to ascertain
whether it was Vivaldi, and the situation
was so dangerous that she hoped it was not
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Her doubts were removed, when, look∣ing
up, he perceived Ellena, and she heard
his voice.</P>
<P>Vivaldi had learned from a lay-brother of
the convent, whom Paulo had bribed, and
who, when he worked in the garden, had
sometimes seen Ellena at the window, that
she frequented this remote turret; and, at
the hazard of his life, he had now ventured
thither, with a hope of conversing with her.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="337"/>
Ellena, alarmed at his tremendous situa∣tion,
refused to listen to him, but he would
not leave the spot till he had communicat∣ed
a plan concerted for her escape, and,
entreating that she would confide herself to
his care, assured her she would be conducted
wherever she judged proper. It appeared
that the brother had consented to assist his
views, in consideration of an ample reward,
and to admit him within the walls on this
evening, when, in his pilgrim's habit, he
might have an opportunity of again seeing
Ellena. He conjured her to attend, if pos∣sible,
in the convent parlour during supper,
explaining, in a few words, the motive for
this request, and the substance of the fol∣lowing
particulars:</P>
<P>The Lady-abbess, in observance of the
custom upon high festivals, gave a collation
to the <HI>Padre-abate,</HI> and such of the priests
as had assisted at the vesper-service. A few
strangers of distinction and pilgrims were
also to partake of the entertainments of
<PB N="325" REF="338"/>
this night, among which was included a
concert to be performed by the nuns. At
the collation was to be displayed a profu∣sion
of delicacies, arranged by the sisters,
who had been busy in preparing the pastry
and confectionary during several days, and
who excelled in these articles no less than
in embroidery and other ingenious arts.
This supper was to be given in the abbess's
outer parlour, while she herself, attended
by some nuns of high rank, and a few fa∣vourites,
was to have a table in the inner
apartment, where, separated only by the
grate, she could partake of the conversation
of the holy fathers. The tables were to be
ornamented with artificial flowers, and a
variety of other fanciful devices upon which
the ingenuity of the sisters had been long
employed, who prepared for these fes∣tivals
with as much vanity, and expected
them to dissipate the gloomy monotony of
their usual life, with as much eagerness of
<PB N="326" REF="339"/>
delight, as a young beauty anticipates a first
ball.</P>
<P>On this evening, therefore, every mem∣ber
of the convent would be engaged either
by amusement or business, and to Vivaldi,
who had been careful to inform himself of
these circumstances, it would be easy, with
the assistance of the brother, to obtain ad∣mittance,
and mingle himself among the
spectators, disguised in his pilgrim's habit.
He entreated, therefore, that Ellena would
contrive to be in the abbess's apartment
this evening, when he would endeavour to
convey to her some further particulars of
the plan of escape, and would have mules
in waiting at the foot of the mountain, to
conduct her to the villa Altieri, or to the
neighbouring convent of the Santa della
Pieta. Vivaldi secretly hoped that she might
be prevailed with to give him her hand on
quitting San Stefano, but he forbore to
mention this hope, lest it should be mistaken
for a condition, and that Ellena might
<PB N="327" REF="340"/>
be either reluctant to accept his assistance,
or, accepting it, might consider herself
bound to grant a hasty consent.</P>
<P>To his mention of escape she listened
with varying emotion; at one moment at∣tending
to it with hope and joy, as promis∣ing
her only chance of liberation from an
imprisonment, which was probably intend∣ed
to last for her life, and of restoring her
to Vivaldi; and at another, recoiling from
the thought of departing with him, while
his family was so decidedly averse to their
marriage. Thus, unable to form any in∣stant
resolution on the subject, and entreat∣ing
that he would leave his dangerous sta∣tion
before the thickening twilight should
encrease the hazard of his descent, Ellena
added, that she would endeavour to obtain
admittance to the apartment of the abbess,
and to acquaint him with her final deter∣mination.
Vivaldi understood all the de∣licacy
of her scruples, and though they
<PB N="328" REF="341"/>
afficted him, he honoured the good sense
and just pride that suggested them.</P>
<P>He lingered on the rock till the last mo∣ments
of departing light, and then, with a
heart fluttering with hopes and fears, bade
Ellena farewel, and descended; while she
watched his progress through the silent
gloom, faintly distinguishing him gliding
along ledges of the precipice, and making
his adventurous way from cliff to cliff, till
the winding thickets concealed him from
her view. Still anxious, she remained at
the lattice, but he appeared no more; no
voice announced disaster; and, at length,
she returned to her cell, to deliberate on the
subject of her departure.</P>
<P>Her considerations were interrupted by
Olivia, whose manner indicated something
extraordinary; the usual tranquillity of her
countenance was gone, and an air of grief
mingled with apprehension appeared there.
Before she spoke, she examined the passage
and looked round the cell. “It is as I
<PB N="329" REF="342"/>
feared,” said me abruptly; “my suspicions
are justified, and you, my child, are sacri∣ficed,
unless it were possible for you to quit
the convent this night.”</P>
<P>“What is it that you mean?” said the
alarmed Ellena.</P>
<P>“I have just learned,” resumed the nun,
“that your conduct this morning, which is
understood to have thrown a premeditated
insult upon the abbess, is to be punished
with what they <HI>call</HI> imprisonment; alas!
why should I soften the truth,—with what
I believe is death itself, for who ever re∣turned
alive from that hideous chamber!”</P>
<P>“With death!” said Ellena, aghast;
“Oh, heavens! how have I deserved
death?”</P>
<P>“That is not the question, my daughter,
but how you may avoid it. Within the
deepest recesses of our convent, is a stone
chamber, secured by doors of iron, to
which such of the sisterhood as have been
guilty of any heinous offence have, from
<PB N="330" REF="343"/>
time to time, been consigned. This con∣demnation
admits of no reprieve; the un∣fortunate
captive is left to languish in chains
and darkness, receiving only an allowance
of bread and water just sufficient to pro∣long
her sufferings, till nature, at length,
sinking under their intolerable pressure,
obtains refuge in death. Our records re∣late
several instances of such horrible punish∣ment,
which has generally been inslicted
upon nuns, who, weary of the life which
they have chosen under the first delusions
of the imagination, or which they have been
compelled to accept by the rigour or ava∣rice
of parents, have been detected in escap∣ing
from the convent.”</P>
<P>The nun paused, but Ellena remaining
wrapt in silent thought, she resumed: “One
miserable instance of this severity has oc∣curred
within my memory. I saw the
wretched victim enter that apartment—never
more to quit it alive! I saw, also,
her poor remains laid at rest in the convent
<PB N="331" REF="344"/>
garden! During nearly two years she lan∣guished
upon a bed of straw, denied even
the poor consolation of conversing through
the grate with such of the sisters as pitied
her; and who of us was there that did not
pity her! A severe punishment was threat∣ened
to those, who should approach with
any compassionate intention; thank God! I
incurred it, and I endured it, also, with se∣cret
triumph.”</P>
<P>A gleam of satisfaction passed over Oli∣via's
countenance as she spoke this; it was the
sweetest that Ellena had ever observed there.
With a sympathetic emotion, she threw her∣self
on the bosom of the nun, and wept;
for some moments they were both silent.
Olivia, at length said, “Do you not be∣lieve,
my child, that the officious and of∣fended
abbess will readily seize upon the
circumstance of your disobedience, as a pre∣tence
for confining you in that fatal cham∣ber?
The wishes of the Marchesa will thus
surely be accomplished, without the diffi∣culty
<PB N="332" REF="345"/>
of exacting your obedience to the
vows. Alas! I have received proof too
absolute of her intention, and that to-mor∣row
is assigned as the day of your sacrifice;
you may, perhaps, be thankful that the
business of the festival has obliged her to
defer executing the sentence even till to-morrow.”</P>
<P>Ellena replied only with a groan, as her
head still drooped upon the shoulder of
the nun; she was not now hesitating whether
to accept the assistance of Vivaldi, but de∣sponding
lest his utmost efforts for her de∣liverance
should be vain.</P>
<P>Olivia, who mistook the cause of her
silence, added, “Other hints I could give,
which are strong as they are dreadful, but
I will forbear. Tell me how it is possible
I may assist you; I am willing to incur a
second punishment, in endeavouring to re∣lieve
a second sufferer.”</P>
<P>Ellena's tears flowed fast at this new in∣stance
of the nun's generosity.” But if
<PB N="333" REF="346"/>
they should discover you in assisting me to
leave the convent,” she said, in a voice con∣vulsed
by her gratitude,—“O! if they
should discover you!”—</P>
<P>“I can ascertain the punishment,” Olivia
replied with firmness, “and do not fear to
meet it.”</P>
<P>“How nobly generous this is!” said the
weeping Ellena; “I ought not to suffer you
to be thus careless of yourself!”</P>
<P>“My conduct is not wholly disinterest∣ed,”
the nun modestly replied; “for I
think I could endure any punishment with
more fortitude than the sickening anguish
of beholding such suffering as I have wit∣nessed.
What are bodily pains in compa∣rison
with the subtle, the exquisite tortures
of the mind! Heaven knows I can support
my own afflictions, but not the view of
those of others when they are excessive.
The instruments of torture I believe I could
endure, if my spirit was invigorated with
the consciousness of a generous purpose;
<PB N="334" REF="347"/>
but pity touches upon a nerve that vibrates
instantly to the heart, and subdues resistance.
Yes, my child, the agony of pity is keener
than any other, except that of remorse, and
even in remorse, it is, perhaps, the ming∣ling
unavailing pity, that points the sting.
But, while I am indulging this egotism, I
am, perhaps, increasing your danger of the
suffering I deprecate.”</P>
<P>Ellena, thus encouraged by the generous
sympathy of Olivia, mentioned Vivaldi's
purposed visit of this evening; and con∣sulted
with her on the probability of
procuring admittance for herself to the
abbess's parlour. Reanimated by this
intelligence, Olivia advised her to repair
not only to the supper-room, but to attend
the previous concert, to which several
strangers would be admitted, among whom
might probably be Vivaldi. When to this,
Ellena objected her dread of the abbess's
observation, and of the immediate se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lusion
that would follow, Olivia soothed her fears
<PB N="335" REF="348"/>
of discovery, by offering her the disguise
of a nun's veil, and promising not only to
conduct her to the apartment but to afford
her every possible assistance towards her
escape.</P>
<P>“Among the crowd of nuns, who will
attend in that spacious apartment,” Olivia
added, “it is improbable you would be
distinguished, even if the sisters were less
occupied by amusement, and the abbess
were at leisure to scrutinize. As it is, you
will hazard little danger of discovery; the
Superior, if she thinks of you at all, will
believe that you are still a prisoner in your
cell, but this is an evening of too much im∣portance
to her vanity, for any considera∣tion,
distinct from that emotion, to divide
her attention. Let hope, therefore, support
you, my child, and do you prepare a few
lines to acquaint Vivaldi with your consent
to his proposal, and with the urgency of
your circumstances; you may, perhaps,
<PB N="336" REF="349"/>
find an opportunity of conveying them
through the grate.”</P>
<P>They were still conversing on this sub∣ject,
when a particular chime founded,
which Olivia said summoned the nuns to
the concert-room; and she immediately
hastened for a black veil, while Ellena
wrote the few lines that were necessary for
Vivaldi.</P>
