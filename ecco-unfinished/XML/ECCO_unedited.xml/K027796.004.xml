<L>Anxious she flies to great <HI>Ulysses</HI>' heir,</L>
<L>His instant voyage challeng'd all her care.</L>

<L>Restless he griev'd, with various fears opprest,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="10"/>And all thy fortunes roll'd within his breast.</L>
<L>When, Oh <HI>Telemachus!</HI> (the Goddess said)</L>
<L>Too long in vain, too widely hast thou stray'd.</L>
<L>Thus leaving careless thy paternal right</L>
<L>The robbers prize, the prey to lawless might.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="15"/>On fond pursuits neglectful while you roam,</L>

<L>Hence to <HI>Atrides;</HI> and his leave implore</L>

<L>Fly, whilst thy Mother virtuous yet withstands</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="20"/>Her kindred's wishes, and her Sire's commands;</L>
<L>Thro' both, <HI>Eurymachus</HI> pursues the dame,</L>
<L>And with the noblest gifts asserts his claim.</L>
<L>Hence therefore, while thy stores thy own remain;</L>
<L>Thou know'st the practice of the female train,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="25"/>Lost in the children of the present spouse</L>
<L>They slight the pledges of their former vows;</L>

Their love is always with the lover past;</L>
<L>Still the succeeding flame expells the last.</L>
<L>Let o'er thy house some chosen maid preside,</L>
<L>'Till heav'n decrees to bless thee in a bride.<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>But now thy more attentive ears incline,</L>
<L>Observe the warnings of a pow'r divine:</L>
<L>For thee their snares the Suitor Lords shall lay</L>
<L>In <HI>Samos</HI> sands, or streights of <HI>Ithaca,</HI></L>
<L>To seize thy life shall lurk the murd'rous band,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>Ere yet thy footsteps press thy native land.</L>
<L>No—sooner far their riot and their lust</L>
<L>All-cov'ring earth shall bury deep in dust!</L>
<L>Then distant from the scatter'd Islands steer,</L>
<L>Nor let the night retard thy full career;<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Thy heav'nly guardian shall instruct the gales</L>
<L>To smooth thy passage, and supply thy sails:</L>

<L>Send to the town thy vessel with thy friends,</L>
<L>But seek thou first the Master of the swine,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>

<L>That thou safe sailing from the <HI>Pylian</HI> strand</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="50"/>Art come to bless her in thy native land.</L>
<L>Thus spoke the Goddess, and resum'd her flight</L>
<L>To the pure regions of eternal light.</L>
<L>Mean-while <HI>Pisistratus</HI> he gently shakes,</L>
<L>And with these words the slumb'ring youth awakes.</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="55"/>Rise, son of <HI>Nestor!</HI> for the road prepare,</L>
<L>And join the harness'd coursers to the car.</L>
<L>What cause, he cry'd, can justifie our flight,</L>
<L>To tempt the dangers of forbidding night?</L>
<L>Here wait we rather, till approaching day</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="60"/>Shall prompt our speed, and point the ready way.</L>
<L>Nor think of flight before the <HI>Spartan</HI> King</L>
<L>Shall bid farewel, and bounteous presents bring;</L>
<L>Gifts, which to distant ages safely stor'd,</L>
<L>The sacred act of friendship shall record.</L>

As soon as his approach the Heroe knew,</L>
<L>The splendid mantle round him first he threw,</L>
<L>Then o'er his ample shoulders whirl'd the cloak,</L>

<L>Let not thy Friends in vain for licence move.</L>
<L>Swift let us measure back the wat'ry way,</L>
<L>Nor check our speed, impatient of delay.</L>
<L>If with desire so strong thy bosom glows,<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>Ill, said the King, shou'd I thy wish oppose;</L>
<L>For oft in others freely I reprove</L>
<L>The ill-tim'd efforts of officious love;</L>
<L>Who love too much, hate in the like extream,</L>
<L>And both the golden Mean alike condemn.<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>Alike he thwarts the hospitable end,</L>

<L><MILESTONE N="100"/>To whom the Youth for prudence fam'd, reply'd.</L>
<L>O Monarch, care of heav'n! thy people's pride!</L>
<L>No friend in <HI>Ithaca</HI> my place supplies,</L>
<L>No pow'rful hands are there, no watchful eyes:</L>

<L>Mean-time the King, his Son, and <HI>Helen,</HI> went</L>
<L>Where the rich wardrobe breath'd a costly scent.<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>The King selected from the glitt'ring rows</L>
<L>A bowl; the Prince a silver beaker chose.</L>

<L>Her own fair hands embroider'd ev'ry part:</L>
<L>Beneath the rest it lay divinely bright,</L>
<L>Like radiant <HI>Hesper</HI> o'er the gems of night.</L>

<L>Then gave the cup; while <HI>Megapenthe</HI> brought</L>

<L>The beauteous Queen advancing next, display'd</L>
<L>The shining veil, and thus endearing said.</L>

<L>She said, and gave the veil; with grateful look,</L>
<L><MILESTONE N="145"/>The Prince the variegated present took.</L>
<L>And now, when thro' the royal dome they pass'd,</L>

<L>The horses join, the polish'd car ascend.</L>

<L>The King precedes; a bowl with fragrant wine</L>
<L>(Libation destin'd to the Pow'rs divine)<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>His right-hand held: before the steeds he stands,</L>

Farewel and prosper, youths! let <HI>Nestor</HI> know</L>
<L>What grateful thoughts still in this bosom glow,</L>

<L>As thus the plumy sov'reign of the air</L>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
FIFTEENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>EITHER this book, nor indeed some of the
following, are to be reckon'd among the most
shining parts of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> They are nar∣rative,
and generally low; yet natural, and
just enough, considering <HI>Homer</HI> was resolv∣ed
to describe and follow low life so very
minutely. This great Poet here resembles an
evening Sun; he has not the same heat or
brightness; there are several little clouds about him, tho' in some
places gilded and adorn'd: however, to make us amends, he
breaks out again before the conclusion of his course, and sets at
last in glory.</P>
<P>There is no doubt, but all the parts of a Poem are not capa∣ble
of equal lustre; nay, they ought not to dazzle us alike, or
tire us by a perpetual strain upon the Imagination. But in these
cooler relations a Translator has a hard task: He is expected to
<HI>shine,</HI> where the Author is <HI>not bright:</HI> and the unreasonable Cri∣tick
demands a Copy more noble than the Original. 'Tis true,
these are the passages of which he ought to take particular care,
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
and to set them off to the best advantage: But however he may
polish a vulgar stone, it will still retain its inherent degree of
cloudiness; and the Man is ignorant indeed, who thinks one
can make it a Diamond.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>The story now turns to <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and the Poet briefly de∣scribes
his voyage to his country: There is a necessity to be
concise, for the Heroe of an Epic Poem is never to be out of
sight, after his introduction. The little time that <HI>Homer</HI> employs
in the return of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> is not spent unusefully by <HI>Ulysses;</HI> du∣ring
this interval, he learns the state of his publick and dome∣stick
affairs from <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> and prepares the way for the destructi∣on
of the Suitors, the chief design of the whole <HI>Odyssey.</HI> There
is another reason why the Poet ought not to dwell at large upon
the story of <HI>Telemachus;</HI> he bears but an incidental relation to the
<HI>Odyssey,</HI> and consequently <HI>Homer</HI> was necessitated to pass over his
actions with brevity, that he might describe the Heroe of his
Poem at full length. It has been objected, that no mention has
been made of any Action at all of <HI>Telemachus</HI> during his whole
stay with <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and that he lies there idly, without making
his voyage contribute any thing to the restitution of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> but
from the former observation it is evident, that this silence in the
Poet proceeds from judgment; nothing is to be inserted in an E∣pic
Poem but what has some affinity with the main design of
it: but what affinity could the Actions of <HI>Telemachus</HI> in the <HI>Spar∣tan</HI>
Court have with those of <HI>Ulysses?</HI> This would have been to
make two Heroes in one Poem, and would have broken the Uni∣ty
of the Action; whereas by the contrary conduct <HI>Homer</HI> unites
the two stories, and makes the voyage of <HI>Telemachus</HI> subservient
to the chief Action; namely, the restitution of <HI>Ulysses. Telema∣chus</HI>
undertakes a voyage to make enquiry after <HI>Ulysses;</HI> this the
Poet fully describes, because it has an immediate relation to <HI>Ulysses;</HI>
but passes over all other adventures during the absence of <HI>Telema∣chus,</HI>
because they have no relation to the design.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="39"/>
I know it has been objected, that the whole story of <HI>Telema∣chus</HI>
is foreign to the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and that the four first books have
not a sufficient connection with the rest of the Poem, and there∣fore
that there is a double Action: But this objection will cease,
if it be made appear, that this voyage contributes to the restora∣tion
of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> for whatever incident has such an effect is united
to the subject, and essential to it. Now that this voyage has
such an effect is very evident; the Suitors were ready to seize the
Throne of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and compel his wife to marry; but by this
voyage <HI>Telemachus</HI> breaks their whole designs. Instead of usurp∣ing
the Throne, they are oblig'd to defend themselves: they de∣fer
their purpose, and waste much time in endeavouring to in∣tercept
him in his return. By this method leisure is gained from
the violence and addresses of the Suitors, till <HI>Ulysses</HI> returns and
brings about his own re-establishment. This voyage therefore is
the secret source from which all the happiness of <HI>Ulysses</HI> flows:
for had not <HI>Telemachus</HI> sailed to <HI>Pyle, Penelope</HI> must have been
compell'd to marry, and the Throne of <HI>Ulysses</HI> usurp'd. I have
been more large upon this Objection, because many foreign Cri∣tics
lay great weight upon it. See Note XIX on the first book.</P>
<P>There has lately been a great dispute amongst the <HI>French,</HI> con∣cerning
the length of the stay of <HI>Telemachus</HI> from his country.
The debate is not very material, nor is it very difficult to settle that
point. <HI>Telemachus</HI> sail'd from <HI>Ithaca</HI> in the evening of the se∣cond
day, and returns to it on the thirty eighth in the morning,
so that he is absent thirty five days compleatly.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 1. <HI>Now had</HI> Minerva, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If this had been re∣lated
by an Historian, he would have only said that <HI>Telemachus</HI>
judg'd it necessary for his affairs to sail back to his own country;
but a Poet steps out of the common beaten road, ascribes the
Wisdom of that Heroe to the Goddess of it, and introduces
her in person, to give a dignity to his Poetry.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="40"/>
The Reader may consult in general the extracts from <HI>Bossu,</HI>
(plac'd before the <HI>Odyssey</HI>) concerning Machines, or the inter∣position
of Deities in Epic Poetry: I will here beg leave to set
them in a different and more particular light.</P>
<P>It has been imagin'd that a Deity is never to be introduc'd
but when all human means are ineffectual: If this were true,
<HI>Minerva</HI> would be in vain employ'd in bringing <HI>Telemachus</HI> back,
when a common Messenger might have answer'd that purpose as
well as the Goddess. I doubt not but the verse of <HI>Horace</HI> has
led many into this error;
<Q>Nec Deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus.</Q>
This rule is to be apply'd only to the Theater, of which <HI>Ho∣race</HI>
there speaks, and means no more, than when the knot of the
Play is to be unty'd, and no other way is left for making the
discovery, then let a God descend and clear the intricacy to the
Auditors. But, as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> observes, it has no relation to Epic
Poetry.</P>
<P>It is true, that a Deity is never to be introduced upon little
and unworthy occasions; the very design of Machines is to add
weight and dignity to the story, and consequently an unworthy
employment defeats the very intent of them, and debases the
Deities by making them act in offices unworthy of the chara∣cters
of divine personages: But then it is as true, that a Poet is
at liberty to use them for ornament as well as necessity. For in∣stance,
both <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> in their descriptions of Storms in∣troduce
Deities, <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Aeolus,</HI> only to fill our minds with
grandeur and terror; for in reality a storm might have hap∣pen'd
without a miracle, and <HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Ulysses</HI> both have been
driven upon unknown shores, by a common storm as well as by
the immediate interposition of <HI>Neptune</HI> or <HI>Aeolus.</HI> But Machines
have a very happy effect; the Poet seems to converse with Gods,
gives signs of a divine transport, and distinguishes his Poem in
all parts from an History.</P>

landed in <HI>Ithaca</HI> in the morning of the thirty fifth day; and
when <HI>Minerva</HI> left him, she went to the <HI>Spartan</HI> Court to <HI>Tele∣machus;</HI>
this vision therefore appears to that Heroe in the night

from <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and lodges that night with <HI>Diocles;</HI> on the thirty
seventh he embarks towards the evening, sails all night, and lands
on the thirty eighth in the morning in his own country. From

in discourse with <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> tho' the Poet only distinguishes the time
by the voyage of <HI>Telemachus;</HI> for the preceding book concludes
with the thirty fifth day, and <HI>Telemachus</HI> spends the thirty sixth
and thirty seventh and the following night in his return, and
meets <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the morning of the thirty eighth day. This re∣mark

why the Poet ascribes a greater quickness and penetration to <HI>He∣len</HI>
in the solution of this prodigy, than to <HI>Menelaus.</HI> Is it, as
<HI>Eustathius</HI> asserts, from a superior acuteness of nature and pre∣sence

some modern beauties, who (tho' their husbands be asked

believe that <HI>Helen</HI> might happen to stand in such a position, as
to be able to make more minute observations upon the flight of

observation, she might for that reason be more ready and cir∣cumstantial
in the interpretation. But <HI>Homer</HI> himself tells us,
that she receiv'd it from the Gods. This is a pious lesson, to
teach us in general that all knowledge is the gift of God, and

bracelet by <HI>Polynices,</HI> persuaded her husband <HI>Amphiaraus</HI> to go
to the <HI>Theban</HI> war, where he lost his life. This is a remarkable
passage: <HI>Tho' he was lov'd by</HI> Jupiter <HI>and</HI> Apollo, <HI>yet he reach'd not
to old age.</HI> Is a short life the greatest instance of the love of the
Gods? <HI>Plato</HI> quotes the verse to this purpose. “The life of
man is so loaded with calamity, that it is an instance of the fa∣vour
of Heaven to take the burthen from us with speed.” The
same Author in <HI>Axiochus</HI> (if that dialogue be his) asserts, that the
Gods having a perfect insight into human affairs, take speedily
to themselves those whom they love. Thus when <HI>Trophonius</HI> and
<HI>Agamedes</HI> had built a temple to <HI>Apollo,</HI> they pray'd to receive a
blessing the most beneficial to mankind: the God granted their
prayers, and they were both found dead the next morning. Thus
likewise the Priestess of <HI>Juno,</HI> when her two sons had yok'd
themselves to her chariot, and drawn her for the greater expedi∣tion

There is nothing more common than such accounts of men be∣ing
carry'd away by Goddesses, in all the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets; and yet
what offends more against credibility? The Poets invented these
fables merely out of compliment to the dead. When any
<PB N="49" REF="49"/>
person happen'd to be drowned in a river; if a man, some Wa∣ter-Nymph
stole him; if a woman, she was seiz'd to be the wife
of the River God. If any were lost at sea, <HI>Neptune</HI> or some of
the Sea Gods or Goddesses had taken them to their beds. But
to speak to the present purpose; if any person dy'd in the fields,
and his body happen'd not to be found, if he was murther'd
and buried, or devoured by wild beasts, so that no account was
heard of his death, he was immediately imagin'd to be taken
from the earth by some Deity who was in love with his beauty.
Thus <HI>Clitus</HI> being lost in his morning sports, like <HI>Orion</HI> while

it not being capable of any ornaments of Poetry. I could wish
<HI>Homer</HI> had omitted or shorten'd such passages, tho' they might
be useful in his age; for by such honourable insertions he made
his court to the best families then in <HI>Greece.</HI> 'Tis true, the story
is told concisely, and this occasions some obscurity; distance of
time as well as place, makes us see all objects somewhat confu∣sedly
and indistinctly. In the days of <HI>Homer</HI> these stories were
universally known, and consequently wanted no explication; the
obscurity therefore is not to be charg'd upon <HI>Homer,</HI> but to Time
which has defac'd and worn away some parts of the impression,
and made the images less discernible.</P>
<P>The use the Poet makes of the adventure of <HI>Theoclymenus,</HI> is
to give encouragement to <HI>Telemachus;</HI> he assists him with his ad∣vice,
and by his gift of prophecy explains to him a prodigy in

the parents of <HI>Telemachus?</HI> But the interrogations are very mate∣rial;
he makes them to learn if <HI>Telemachus</HI> or his father are
friends to the person slain by his hand? if they were, instead of
sailing with him, he would have reason to fly from him, as from
a person who might take away his life by the laws of the coun∣try.
Thus in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> law, <HI>Numb.</HI> xxxv. 9. <HI>The revenger of
blood</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>propinquus</HI>) <HI>shall slay the murderer, when
he meeteth him.</HI> But the <HI>Jews</HI> had cities of refuge, to which the
murtherers fled as to a sanctuary: The <HI>Greeks</HI> in like manner, if
the homicide fled into a voluntary exile, permitted him to be in
security till the murther was atton'd, either by fulfilling a cer∣tain
time of banishment, or by a pecuniary mulct or expia∣tion.</P>
<P>I will only further remark the conciseness of these interroga∣tions
of <HI>Theoclymenus;</HI> he asks four questions in a breath, in the
compass of one line; his apprehensions of being pursued give
him no leisure to expatiate. <HI>Homer</HI> judiciously adapts his Po∣etry
to the circumstances of the murtherer, a man in fear
being in great haste to be in security. <HI>Telemachus</HI> answers
with equal brevity, being under a necessity to finish his voyage
in the night to avoid the ambush of the suitors. For this reason
<HI>Homer</HI> shortens the relation, and complies with the exigency of
<HI>Telemachus:</HI> With this further view; to unite the subordi∣nate
story of <HI>Telemachus</HI> with that of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> it being necessary
to hasten to the chief action and without delay carry on the

<HI>Mercury</HI> was the servant and minister of the Gods, and was feign∣ed
to be the patron of all persons of the like station upon earth;
it was suppos'd to be by his favour that all servants and attendants
were successful in their several functions. In this view the con∣nexion
will be easy, “I will go (says <HI>Ulysses</HI>) and offer my
service to the Suitors, and by the favour of <HI>Mercury,</HI> who gives
success to persons of my condition, shall prosper; for no man
is better able to execute the offices of attendance, than my
self.” It may be objected, that these functions are un∣worthy
of the character, and beneath the dignity of an Heroe:
but <HI>Ulysses</HI> is obliged to act in his assum'd, not real cha∣racter;
as a beggar, not as a King. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> (<HI>lib.</HI> 1. p. 18.)

enlarges upon other circumstances, relating to his family and af∣fairs,

leaves in its room an anxiety for the want of it, and if
it be a guilty pleasure, a remorse. The reason (observes <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI>)
why past evils delight, is from the consciousness of the

The words in <HI>Homer</HI> are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>solis conversiones.</HI>
Monsieur <HI>Perrault</HI> insults the Poet as ignorant of Geography, for
placing <HI>Syros</HI> under the <HI>Tropick;</HI> an error (says he) which Com∣mentators
in vain have labour'd to defend, by having recourse to
a Sun-dial of <HI>Pherecydes</HI> on which the motions of the Sun (the
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) were design'd. The last defence would indeed
be ridiculous, since <HI>Pherecydes</HI> flourish'd three hundred years after
the time of <HI>Homer:</HI> No one (replies Monsieur <HI>Boileau</HI>) was ever
at any difficulty about the sense of this passage; <HI>Eustathius</HI> proves
that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies the same as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and denotes the set∣ting
of the Sun; so that the words mean, that <HI>Syros</HI> is situate
above <HI>Ortygia,</HI> on that side where the Sun sets, or westerly, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
'Tis true, <HI>Eustathius</HI> mentions
a bower, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in which the conversions of the Sun were
figur'd. This indeed would fully vindicate <HI>Homer;</HI> but <HI>Bochart</HI>
and others affirm, that <HI>Eustathius</HI> is in an error, and that <HI>Syros</HI> is
so far from lying to the west, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that it
<PB N="57" REF="57"/>
bears an eastern position both with respect to <HI>Ithaca</HI> and <HI>Delos:</HI>
How is this objection to be answer'd? <HI>Bochart, p.</HI> 411 of his
<HI>Geographia sacra,</HI> explains it by having recourse to the bower
mention'd by <HI>Eustathius,</HI> in which the motions of the Sun were
drawn. <HI>Pherecydes</HI> (says <HI>Hesychius Milesius</HI>) having collected the
writings of the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> from the use of them alone without
any instructor, became famous in the world by the strength of
his own genius: And <HI>Laertius</HI> writes, that an <HI>Heliotrope</HI> made
by him was preserv'd in the Island of <HI>Syros.</HI> Thus it is evident,
that he borrow'd his knowledge from the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> and pro∣bably
his skill in Astronomy, they being very expert in that sci∣ence,
by reason of its use in their navigation. Why then might
there not be a machine which exhibited the motions of the Sun,
made by the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> and why might not <HI>Homer</HI> be acquaint∣ed
with it? It is probable that <HI>Pherecydes</HI> took his pattern from
this <HI>Heliotrope,</HI> which being one of the greatest rarities of an∣tiquity,
might give a great reputation to <HI>Syros,</HI> and consequent∣ly
was worthy to be celebrated by <HI>Homer,</HI> the great preserver of
Antiquities. <HI>Fallitur igitur,</HI> (says <HI>Bochart</HI>) <HI>Eustathius, cùm vult intelligi,
quasi sita sit Syrus ad occiduas partes Deli; cum contra Deli ad ortum sit
Syrus, non ad occasum; &amp; rem sic se habere ex ipso Homero patet,
apud quem Eumaeus in Ithacâ, Syriam asserit esse trans Delum, quo ni∣hil
dici potuit falsius, si Syrus sit ad occasum Deli.</HI> If this answer
appears to any person too studied and abstruse, the difficulty may
be solv'd, by supposing <HI>Eumaeus</HI> speaking of <HI>Delos</HI> as it lay with
respect to <HI>Syrus,</HI> before he was carry'd from it; for instance, if
<HI>Syrus</HI> lies on the east of <HI>Delos</HI> to a man in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> both <HI>Ithaca</HI>
and <HI>Delos</HI> will lie on the west of <HI>Syrus</HI> to one of that Island; I
would therefore imagine that <HI>Eumaeus</HI> speaks as a native of <HI>Syros,</HI>
and not as a sojourner in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> and then <HI>Delus</HI> will lie towards

It is probable that <HI>Homer</HI> was well acquainted with the nature of

Their gentle blandishment the King survey'd,</L>

<L><MILESTONE N="10"/>His steps I hear; the dogs familiar play.</L>
<L>While yet he spoke, the Prince advancing drew</L>

<L>Transported from his seat <HI>Eumaeus</HI> sprung,</L>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
SIXTEENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>VERSE</HI> 1. Soon as the morning blush'd along the Plains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS Book opens with the greatest simplicity
imaginable. <HI>Dionysius Halicarn.</HI> quotes the six∣teen
first Lines to this purpose: The Poet,
says that Author, describes a low and vulgar
action, yet gives it an inexpressible sweet∣ness;
the ear is pleas'd with the harmony of
the Poetry, and yet there is nothing noble in
the sentiments. Whence, continues he, does
this arise? from the choice of the words, or from the placing of
them? No one will affirm that it consists in the choice of the
words, for the diction is entirely low and vulgar, so vulgar that
a common Artificer or Peasant, who never studied elocution,
wou'd use it in conversation; turn the Verses into Prose, and this
will appear. There are no transpositions, no figures, no variety
of dialect, nor any new and studied expressions. Where then is
the beauty of the Poetry? It must be entirely ascrib'd to the har∣monious
<PB N="96" REF="94"/>
juncture and position of the words; and he concludes
that the <HI>collocation</HI> of words has a greater efficacy both in Prose and
Poetry, than the <HI>choice.</HI> And indeed a judicious Disposition of them
(like what is feign'd of <HI>Minerva</HI> in this Book) makes a mean, de∣form'd,
and vulgar period, rise, like <HI>Ulysses</HI> from beggary, into pomp
and dignity. This may be exemplify'd from the rules of mechanic
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts: an Architect, when he gathers his materials for a building,
has these three things chiefly in view: first, with what piece of
stone, wood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a correspondent piece will best agree: next
he considers their several formations, and how it will best stand in
the structure; and lastly, if any part of the materials suits not
with the allotted place, he rejects it or new shapes it, till it agrees
with the whole work: The same care is to be taken by a good
writer: he is first to consider what Noun or Verb is to be join'd
to other Nouns or Verbs so fitly, as not possibly to be
plac'd more conveniently; for a promiscuous connecting of
words indiscriminately spoils both Prose and Poetry: Next he
considers the frame and turn of the Verb or Noun, and how it
will stand in the place he allots it; and if it suits not exactly, he
changes it, sometimes by varying the Numbers, sometimes the
Cases, and at other times the Genders: And lastly, if a word
prove so stubborn as not to bend to the level of the period, he
entirely rejects it, and introduces another that preserves a due
conformity; or at least, if an inharmonious word be necessary,
he places it so judiciously between more agreeable and tuneful
words, that their harmony steals away our imagination from ob∣serving
the roughness of the others: Like wise Generals, who
in ordering the ranks of their Soldiers, strengthen the weaker files
by sustaining them with the stronger; and by this method render
the whole invincible. See likewise <HI>Cap.</HI> 32. of <HI>Longinus,</HI> of the
disposition of words.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 3.—<HI>their meal prepare.</HI>] The word in the origi∣ginal
is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which here denotes very evidently the morning
repast: it is used but in one other place in all <HI>Homer</HI> in this sense:
<HI>Iliad, Lib.</HI> 24. <HI>V.</HI> 124.
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
But we are not therefore to imagine that this was an unusual meal;
<HI>Homer</HI> in other places expresses it by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as is observ'd by <HI>Athe∣naeus,
Lib.</HI> 1.
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
“At the dawn of the day they took repast and arm'd them∣selves
for battle.” The <HI>Greeks</HI> had three customary meals,
are distinctly mention'd by <HI>Palamedes</HI> in <HI>Aeschylus,</HI>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
<HI>Homer,</HI> adds <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> mentions a fourth repast, <HI>Lib.</HI> 17 of the
<HI>Odyssey:</HI>
<Q>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
This the <HI>Romans</HI> called <HI>commessationem,</HI> we a collation, a repast
taken, as the same Author explains it, between dinner and sup∣per;
the word is deriv'd <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>the evening
twilight.</HI> But <HI>Athenaeus</HI> refutes himself, <HI>lib.</HI> 5. <HI>p.</HI> 193. I have
already (says he) observ'd that the Antients eat thrice a-day; and
'tis ridiculous to imagine that they eat four times, from these
words of <HI>Homer,</HI>
<Q><PB N="98" REF="96"/>
—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
For that expression means only that <HI>Eumaeus</HI> should return in the
evening, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But this is not the full im∣port
of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, for it undoubtedly means, To take
the evening repast or supper, as is evident from the conclusion of
the seventeenth Book of the <HI>Odyssey: Return,</HI> says <HI>Telemachus</HI> to
<HI>Eumaeus, but first take refreshment;</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus</HI> accordingly eats,
and the Poet immediately adds, <HI>because the Evening was come,</HI> or
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. However in no sense can this word be brought
to prove that the <HI>Greeks</HI> eat four times in the day; but if any
person will imagine that it signifies in that place an immediate
meal, all that can be gather'd from it is, that <HI>Telemachus</HI> out of
kindness to <HI>Eumaeus</HI> commands him to eat before the usual hour
of repast, before he leaves his palace; but <HI>Hesychius</HI> rightly in∣terprets
it by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that is, <HI>eating his supper;</HI>
for as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signify the dinner, so <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
denote the time of supper promiscuously.</P>
<P>I will add no more, but refer the Reader for a full Explica∣tion
of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to <HI>Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>Question</HI> 6. of

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 14. <HI>Drop'd the full bowl</HI>]—In the original it is,
<HI>Eumaeus</HI> drop'd the bowl as he temper'd it with water. It was
customary not to drink wine unmix'd amongst the ancients:
there was no certain proportion observ'd in the mixture; some
to one vessel of wine pour'd in two of water, others to two of
wine, five of water. <HI>Homer</HI> tells us that the wine of <HI>Maron</HI> was
so strong as to require twenty measures of water to one of wine;
but perhaps this is spoken hyperbolically, to shew the uncom∣mon
strength of it. The <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> us'd to boil their wine
till the fifth part was consum'd, and then keeping it four
years, drank it: but sometimes the <HI>Grecians</HI> drank it without
<PB N="99" REF="97"/>
water (but this they call'd reproachfully <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or to act like
a <HI>Scythian,</HI> from whom they borrow'd the custom.) It was usual
even for Children to drink wine thus temper'd, amongst the <HI>Gre∣cians;</HI>
thus in this Book <HI>Eurymachus</HI>
<Q>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
And <HI>Phoenix</HI> in the 9th of the <HI>Iliads,</HI> speaking of <HI>Achilles:</HI>
<Q><L>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
At <HI>Athens</HI> there was an altar erected to <HI>Bacchus</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, because
from thus tempering the wine men return'd <HI>upright</HI> or sober from
entertainments; and a law was enacted by <HI>Amphitryon,</HI> and after∣wards
reviv'd by <HI>Solon,</HI> that no unmix'd wine should be drank at
any entertainment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 33.
<Q><L>—if in the court the Queen reside</L>
<L>Severely chaste, or if commenc'd a bride?—</L></Q>
<HI>Homer</HI> here makes use of a proverbial expression. It may thus be
literally translated,
<Q><L>Or say if obstinate no more to wed,</L>
<L>She dooms to spiders nets th' imperial bed?</L></Q>
<HI>Telemachus</HI> means by this question, if <HI>Penelope</HI> be determin'd no
more to marry; for the marriage-bed was esteem'd so sacred,
that upon the decease or absence of the husband, it remain'd un∣us'd.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> quotes the same expression from other Authors of
Antiquity; thus <HI>Hesiod,</HI>
<Q><PB N="100" REF="98"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
“You shall clear the vessels from spiders webs;” meaning that
<HI>you shall have so full employment for your vessels, that the spiders
shall no more spread their looms there.</HI> And another Poet praying for
peace, wishes spiders may weave their nets upon the soldiers arms;
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
Thus we find amongst the <HI>Greeks</HI> it
was an expression of dignity, and apply'd to great and serious oc∣casions;
I am not certain that it is so used by the <HI>Romans. Ca∣tullus</HI>
uses it jocosely speaking of his empty purse.
<Q><L>—nam tui Catulli</L>
<L>Plenus sacculus est aranearum.</L></Q>
<HI>Plautus</HI> does the same in his <HI>Aulularia:</HI>
<Q><L>—anne quis aedes auferat?</L>
<L>Nam hic apud nos nihil est aliud quaesti furibus</L>
<L>Ita inaniis sunt oppletae, atque araneis.</L></Q>
I am doubtful if it be not too mean an image for <HI>English</HI>
Poetry.</P>

<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 43. <HI>Not so—(exclaims the Prince</HI>—Nothing
can more strongly represent the respect which antiquity paid to
strangers, than this conduct of <HI>Telemachus: Ulysses</HI> is in rags, in
the disguise of a beggar, and yet a Prince refuses to take his seat.
I doubt not but every good man will be pleas'd with such in∣stances
of benevolence and humanity to his fellow-creatures; one
well-natur'd action is preferable to a thousand great ones, and <HI>Te∣lemachus</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="99"/>
appears with more advantage upon this heap of hides
and osiers, than a Tyrant upon his throne.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 52. <HI>The frugal remnants of the former day.</HI>] This en∣tertainment
is neither to be ascrib'd to parsimony nor poverty, but
to the custom and hospitality of former ages. It was a common
expression among the <HI>Greeks</HI> at table, <HI>leave something for the</HI> Medes;
intimating that something ought to be left for a guest that might
come accidentally. <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his 7th Book of the <HI>Sympos. Question</HI> 3.
commends this conduct. <HI>Eumaeus</HI> (says that Author) a wise scho∣lar
of a wise master, is no way discomposed, when <HI>Telemachus</HI>
pays him a visit, he immediately sets before him
<Q>The frugal remnants of the former day.</Q>
Besides, the table was accounted sacred to the Gods, and nothing
that was sacred was permitted to be empty; this was another
reason why the Ancients always reserv'd part of their provisions,
not solely out of hospitality to men, but piety to the Gods.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 70. <HI>Willing to aid,</HI>—] It has been observ'd that
<HI>Homer</HI> intended to give us the picture of a compleat Heroe in
his two Poems, drawn from the characters of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Ulysses:
Achilles</HI> has consummate valour, but wants the wisdom of <HI>Ulysses:
Ulysses</HI> has courage, but courage inclining to caution and strata∣gem,
as much as that of <HI>Achilles</HI> to rashness. <HI>Virgil</HI> endeavour'd
to form a compleat Heroe in <HI>Aeneas,</HI> by joining in his person
the forward Courage of <HI>Achilles</HI> with the wisdom of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and
by this conduct gives us a perfect character. The same observation
holds good with respect to the subordinate characters introduc'd
into the two Poems of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey;</HI> and makes an es∣sential
difference between them: Thus the <HI>Iliad</HI> exhibiting an
<PB N="102" REF="100"/>
example of heroic valour, almost all the characters are violent
and heroic. <HI>Diomed, Ajax, Hector,</HI> &amp;c. are all chiefly remarkable
for courage: But the <HI>Odyssey</HI> being intended to represent the pa∣tience
and wisdom of an Heroe, almost all the characters are
distinguish'd by benevolence and humanity. <HI>Telemachus</HI> and
<HI>Eumaeus, Alcinous, Nestor</HI> and <HI>Menelaus</HI> are every where represented
in the mild light of wisdom and hospitality. This makes a con∣tinued
difference of style in the Poetry of the two Poems, and the
characters of the agents in the <HI>Odyssey</HI> necessarily exhibit lectures
of piety and morality: The Reader should keep this in his view.
In reading <HI>Homer,</HI> the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is to be look'd upon as a sequel of
the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and then he will find in the two Poems the perfection
of human nature, Consummate courage join'd with consummate
piety. He must be an unobserving Reader, who has not taken
notice of that <HI>Vein of humanity</HI> that runs thro' the whole <HI>Odys∣sey;</HI>
and a bad man, that has not been pleas'd with it. In my
Opinion, <HI>Eumaeus</HI> tending his herds is more amiable than <HI>Achilles</HI>
in all his destructive Glory. There is scarce a speech made in
the <HI>Odyssey</HI> by <HI>Eumaeus, Telemachus</HI> or <HI>Ulysses,</HI> but what tends to
the improvement of mankind: It was this that endear'd the
<HI>Odyssey</HI> to the ancients, and <HI>Homer</HI>'s sentences of morality were
in every mouth, and introduc'd in all conversation for the bet∣ter
conduct of human life. This Verse was thus apply'd by
some of the ancients; a person being ask'd what was the Duty
of an Orator, or Pleader, answer'd from <HI>Homer,</HI>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
In short, I will not deny but that the <HI>Iliad</HI> is by far the nobler
Poem, with respect to the Poetry; it is fit to be read by Kings
and Heroes; but the <HI>Odyssey</HI> is of use to all mankind, as it
teaches us to be good men rather than great, and to prefer
morality to glory.</P>

<P>VERSE 92. <HI>With warmth replies the man of mighty woes.</HI>]
There is not a more spirited speech in all the <HI>Odyssey</HI> than this of
<HI>Ulysses;</HI> his resentment arises from the last words of <HI>Telemachus,</HI>
observes <HI>Eustathius:</HI>
<Q><L>The brave encompass'd by an hostile train,</L>
<L>O'erpow'r'd by numbers, is but brave in vain.</L></Q>
He is preparing his son for the destruction of the Suitors, and
animating him against despair, by reason of their Numbers. This
he brings about, by representing that a brave man in a good
cause prefers death to dishonour. By the same method <HI>Homer</HI>
exalts the character of <HI>Ulysses: Telemachus</HI> thinks it impossible to
resist the Suitors, <HI>Ulysses</HI> not only resists them, but almost with∣out
assistance works their destruction. There is a fine contrast
between the try'd courage of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and the inexperience of
<HI>Telemachus.</HI></P>

Verse, and thus read the passage:
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;</L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
Then the sense will be, <HI>Oh that I were the son of</HI> Ulysses, <HI>or</HI>
Ulysses <HI>himself,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>For, add they, if this Verse be admitted, it breaks the trans∣port
of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s resentment, and cools the warmth of the expres∣sion;
<HI>Eustathius</HI> confesses that he was once of the same opinion,
<PB N="104" REF="102"/>
but afterwards seems dubious; for, continues he, <HI>Ulysses</HI> by saying,
<HI>Oh that I were the son of</HI> Ulysses, <HI>or</HI> Ulysses <HI>himself,</HI> gave room to
suspect that he was himself <HI>Ulysses;</HI> and therefore to efface this
Impression, he adds with great Address,
<Q><L>—(and soon appear</L>
<L>He shall, I trust; a Heroe scorns despair)</L></Q>
And by this method removes all jealousy that might arise from his
former expression. <HI>Dacier</HI> misrepresents <HI>Eustathius;</HI> she says, <HI>Il avoit

he directly says <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that
is, “he uses this Expression, that it may not be suspected that he
is <HI>Ulysses</HI> who speaks:” In reality he inserts these words solely

<PB N="105" REF="103"/>
incidents; and how fully must he be possess'd of his whole sub∣ject,
and take it in all at one view, to bring about the several parts
of it naturally? <HI>Minerva</HI> in the beginning of the fifteenth Book
commanded <HI>Telemachus</HI> to dispatch <HI>Eumaeus</HI> to <HI>Penelope,</HI> to inform
her of his return. Here this command is executed: but is this
all the use the Poet makes of that Errand? It is evident it is not:
This command furnishes him with a natural occasion for the remo∣val
of <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> while <HI>Ulysses</HI> discovers himself to <HI>Telemachus.</HI> But
why might not the discovery have been made before <HI>Eumaeus?</HI>
It was suitable to the cautious character of <HI>Ulysses</HI> not to trust the
knowledge of his person to too many people: besides, if he had
here reveal'd himself to <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> there would not have been room
for the discovery which is made in the future parts of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI>
and consequently the Reader had been robb'd of the pleasure of it:

<HI>Eustathius</HI> reads the words differently, either <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. If we use the former reading, it will be under∣stood
according to the recited translation; if the latter, it must
then be referr'd to <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and imply, <HI>let us cease to inform</HI>
Laertes, <HI>tho' we grieve for him.</HI> I suppose some Critics were
shock'd at the words in the former sense, and thought it cruel
in <HI>Telemachus</HI> not to relieve the sorrows of <HI>Laertes,</HI> which were
occasion'd chiefly thro' fondness to his person: <HI>Dacier</HI> is fully of
this opinion: <HI>Eustathius</HI> prefers neither of the lections: I doubt
not but <HI>Homer</HI> wrote <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; this agrees with the whole
context.

And as for the cruelty of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> in forbidding <HI>Eumaeus</HI> to
go to <HI>Laertes,</HI> there is no room for this objection: he guards
against it, by requesting <HI>Penelope</HI> to give him immediate informa∣tion;
which might be done almost as soon by a messenger from
her, as by <HI>Eumaeus.</HI> Besides, such a messenger to <HI>Laertes</HI> would
be entirely foreign to the Poem; for his knowledge of the re∣turn
of <HI>Telemachus</HI> could contribute nothing to the design of
the <HI>Odyssey:</HI> Whereas the information given to <HI>Penelope</HI> has this
effect; it puts the Suitors upon new measures, and instructs her
how to regulate her own conduct with regard to them; and
therefore the Poet judiciously dwells upon this, and passes over
the other.</P>

<P>VERSE 170. <HI>In form, a virgin</HI>—] Some of the ancient
Philosophers thought the Poets guilty of impiety, in represent∣ing
the Gods assuming human appearances; <HI>Plato</HI> in particular
(<HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>de Repub.</HI>) speaks with great severity. “If a God
(says that Author) changes his own shape, must he as∣sume
a more or less perfect form? undoubtedly a shape
less perfect; for a Deity, as a Deity, can want no per∣fection;
therefore all change must be for the worse: now
it is absurd to imagine that a Deity can be willing to assume
imperfection, for this would be a degradation unworthy of
a divine Power, and consequently it is absurd to imagine that
a Deity can be willing to change the form of a Deity; it
therefore follows, that the Gods enjoying a perfection of na∣ture,
must eternally and unchangeably appear in it.” Let no
Poet therefore (meaning <HI>Homer</HI>) persuade you that the Gods as∣sume
the form of strangers, and are visible in such appearances.
It must be confess'd, that if <HI>Plato</HI> had thus spoken only to refute
the absurd opinions of Antiquity, which imagin'd the Gods to
assume unworthy shapes of bulls, dragons, swans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> only to
<PB N="107" REF="105"/>
perform some rape, or action unbecoming a Deity, reason would
be on his side: But the argument proves too much; it supposes
that a Deity must lose his perfections by any appearance, but
of a Deity; which is an error: If a God acts suitably to the
character of a God, where is the degradation? <HI>Aristotle</HI> was of
this judgment, in opposition to his master <HI>Plato;</HI> and thought it
no diminution to a God to appear in the shape of man, the glo∣ry
of the Creation: In reality, it is a great honour to <HI>Homer,</HI>
that his opinions agree with the verity of the Scriptures, rather
than the conjectures of Philosophers; nay, it is not impossible
but these relations might be borrow'd from the sacred History:
it being manifest that <HI>Homer</HI> had been in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> the native coun∣try

This may seem a circumstance unworthy of Poetry, and ridicu∣lous
to ascribe a greater sagacity to the brute creation, than to
man; but it may be answer'd, that it was the design of the

was visible to the dogs. But I am willing to believe that there
is a deeper meaning, and a beautiful moral couch'd under this

precluded that beautiful interview between <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Telema∣chus</HI>

of a Deity; and then there could have been no room for all
those doubts and fears of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> that enliven and beautifie the
manner of the discovery. The whole relation is indeed an alle∣gory;
The wisdom of <HI>Ulysses</HI> (in Poetry, <HI>Minerva</HI>) suggests to him,
that this is a proper time to reveal himself to <HI>Telemachus;</HI> the
same wisdom (or <HI>Minerva</HI>) instructs him to dress himself like a
King, that he may find the readier credit with his son: In this
dress he appears a new man, young and beautiful, which gives
occasion to <HI>Telemachus</HI> to imagine him a Deity; especially because
he was an infant when his father sail'd to <HI>Troy,</HI> and therefore
tho' he now appears like <HI>Ulysses, Telemachus</HI> does not know him
to be his father. This is the naked story, when stript of its po∣etical

<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 194.—The Prince o'eraw'd</L>
<L>Scarce lifts his eyes, and bows as to a God.]</L></Q>
I must offer a remark in opposition to that of <HI>Dacier</HI> upon this place:
“This fear of <HI>Telemachus</HI> (says that Author) proceeds from the
opinion of the Ancients when the Gods came down visibly;
they thought themselves so unworthy of such a manifestation,
that whenever it happen'd, they believ'd they should die, or
meet with some great calamity:” Thus the <HI>Israelites</HI> address
<HI>Moses; Speak thou to us, and we will hear, but let not the Lord
speak to us, lest we die.</HI> Thus also <HI>Gideon; Alas! O Lord, my
God, because I have seen an Angel of the Lord face to face, and
the Lord said to him, fear not, thou shalt not die.</HI> Hence it is ve∣ry
evident, that this notion prevail'd amongst the <HI>Israelites:</HI> But
how does it appear that the <HI>Greeks</HI> held the same opinion? The
contrary is manifest almost to a demonstration: the Gods are
introduced almost in every book both of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odyssey;</HI> and
yet there is not the least foundation for such an assertion: nay,
<HI>Telemachus</HI> himself in the second book returns thanks to <HI>Minerva</HI>
for appearing to him, and prays for a second vision.
<PB N="109" REF="107"/>
<Q><L>O Goddess! who descending from the skies,</L>
<L>Vouchsaf'd thy presence to my longing eyes;</L>
<L>Hear from thy heav'ns above, O warrior Maid,</L>
<L>Descend once more propitious to my aid!</L></Q>
It is not to be imagin'd that <HI>Telemachus</HI> would have pre∣ferr'd
this prayer, if the presence of the Deity denoted death, or
some great calamity; and all the Heroes throughout the <HI>Iliad</HI>
esteem such intercourses as their glory, and converse with the
Gods without any apprehensions. But whence then proceeds this
fear of <HI>Telemachus?</HI> entirely from a reverential awe, and his own
modesty while he stands in the presence of a Deity; for such he be∣lieves
<HI>Ulysses.</HI> The words of <HI>Telemachus</HI> agree with his behaviour;
he speaks the language of a man in surprize: It is this surprize
at the sudden change of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> that first makes him imagine him
a Deity, and upon that imagination offer him sacrifice and prayer;
the whole behaviour paints the nature of man under surprize,
and which transports the speaker into vehemence and emotion.</P>

<P>VERSE 238. <HI>As the bold eagle</HI>—] This is a beautiful
comparison; but to take its full force, it is necessary to observe
the nature of this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>vultur: Homer</HI> does not compare <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
to that bird merely for its dignity, it being of the Aquiline
kind, and therefore the King of birds; but from the knowledge
of the nature of it, which doubles the beauty of the allusion:
This bird is remarkable for the love it bears towards its young:
<HI>Tearing open her own thigh, she feeds her young with her own
blood:</HI> Thus also another Author;

<HI>Femore exsecto, sanguineo lactis defluxu, suos foetus refocillant.</HI> And
the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> made the vultur their hieroglyphic, to represent
a compassionate nature. This gives a reason why this bird is
introduc'd with peculiar propriety to represent the fondness of
<HI>Ulysses</HI> for <HI>Telemachus.</HI> But where is the point of the similitude?
<HI>Ulysses</HI> embraces his son, but the vultur is said to mourn the
loss of her young: <HI>Eustathius</HI> answers, that the sorrow alone,
and vehemence of it, is intended to be illustrated by the compa∣rison;
I think he should have added the affection <HI>Ulysses</HI> bears to
<HI>Telemachus.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable, that <HI>Homer</HI> inserts very few similitudes in his
<HI>Odyssey,</HI> tho' they occur frequently almost in every book of the
<HI>Iliad.</HI> The <HI>Odyssey</HI> is wrote with more simplicity, and consequent∣ly
there is lese room for allusions. If we observe the similes
themselves inserted in each Poem, we shall find the same diffe∣rence:
In the <HI>Iliad</HI> they are drawn from lions, storms, torrents,
conflagrations, thunder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> from lower objects,
from an heap of thorns, from a shipwright plying the wimble,
an armourer tempering iron, a matron weeping over her dying
husband, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Similes are likewise generally longer in the
<HI>Iliad</HI> than the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and less resemblance between the thing il∣lustrated,
and the illustration; the reason is, in the <HI>Iliad</HI> the simi∣litudes
are introduced to illustrate some great and noble object, and
therefore the Poet proceeds till he has rais'd some noble image to
inflame the mind of the Reader; whereas in these calmer scenes
the Poet keeps closer to the point of allusion, and needs only to
represent the object, to render it entertaining: By the former con∣duct
he raises our admiration above the subject, by adding foreign
embellishments; in the latter, he brings the copy as close as pos∣sible
to the original, to possess us with a true and equal image
of it.</P>
<P>It has been objected by a <HI>French</HI> Critic, that <HI>Homer</HI> is blame∣able
for too great a length in his similitudes; that in the heat of
an action he stops short, and turns to some allusion, which calls
off our attention from the main subject. 'Tis true, comparisons
ought not to be too long, and are not to be plac'd in the heat
<PB N="111" REF="109"/>
of an action, as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> observes, but when it begins to de∣cline:
Thus in the first <HI>Aeneis,</HI> when the storm is in its fury, the
Poet introduces no comparison, because nothing can be more
impetuous than the storm it self; but when the heat of the de∣scription
abates, then lest we should cool too soon, he renews it
by some proper similitude, which still keeps up our attention and
fixes the whole upon our minds. The similitude before us is thus
placed at the conclusion of the Heroe's lamentation, and the Poet
by this method leaves the whole deeply fix'd upon the memory.
<HI>Virgil</HI> has imitated this comparison in his fourth <HI>Georgic,</HI> but
very judiciously substituted the nightingale in the place of
the vultur, that bird being introduced to represent the mourn∣ful
music of <HI>Orpheus.</HI>
<Q><L>Qualis populeâ moerens Philomela sub umbrâ</L>
<L>Amissos queritur foetus quos durus arator</L>
<L>Observans nido implumes detraxit; at illa</L>

Nothing can be sweeter than this comparison of <HI>Virgil,</HI> but the
learned <HI>Huetius</HI> thinks he has found a notorious blunder in it:
This nightingale (says he) in the first line sits in the shade of a
poplar, and yet in the fourth she mourns by night, <HI>flet noctem.</HI>
It is evident that Mons. <HI>Huet</HI> mistakes the word <HI>umbra</HI> for the
shade of the tree, which it casts while the sun shines upon it;
whereas it only means that the bird sings <HI>sub foliis,</HI> or conceal'd
in the leaves of it, which may be done by night as well as by
day: But if it be thought that this is not a sufficient answer,
the passage may be thus understood; The nightingale mourn∣ing
under the shade of a poplar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ceases not all night, or
<HI>flet noctem;</HI> that is, she begins her song in the evening by day,
but mourns all night. Either of these answers are sufficient for

<HI>Ulysses</HI> of his son's wisdom, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> conjectures? this can
scarce be suppos'd, <HI>Ulysses</HI> being superior in wisdom. I would
chuse rather to ascribe it to human nature; for it has been ob∣served,
that affection seldom so strongly ascends, as it descends;
the child seldom loves the father so tenderly, as the father the
child: This observation has been made from the remotest Anti∣quity.
And it is wisely design'd by the great Author of our Na∣tures;
for in the common course of life, the child must bury the
parent; it is therefore a merciful dispensation, that the tye of
blood and affection should be loosen'd by degrees, and not torn
violently asunder in the full strength of it. It is expected that aged

This whole discourse between <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Telemachus</HI> is introduc'd
to prepare the Reader for the Catastrophe of the Poem: <HI>Homer</HI>
judiciously interests Heaven in the cause, that the Reader may
not be surpriz'd at the event, when he sees such numbers fall by
the hands of these Heroes; he consults probability, and as the
Poem now draws to a conclusion, sets the assistance of Hea∣ven
full before the Reader.</P>
<P>It is likewise very artful to let us into some knowledge of the
event of the Poem; all care must be taken that it be rather guess'd
than known. If it be entirely known, the Reader finds nothing
new to awaken his attention; if on the contrary it be so intri∣cate,
that the event cannot possibly be guessed at, we wander in
the dark, and are lost in uncertainty. The art of the Poet
consists not in concealing the event entirely; but when it
is in some measure foreseen, in introducing such a number of
incidents that now bring us almost into sight of it, then
by new obstacles perplex the story to the very conclusion of the
Poem; every obstacle, and every removal of it, fills us with sur∣prize,
<PB N="114" REF="112"/>
with pleasure or pain alternately, and consequently calls up
our whole attention. This is admirably describ'd by <HI>Vida, lib.</HI> 2.
<Q><L>—Eventus nonnullis soepe canendo</L>
<L>Indiciis porrò oftendunt in luce malignâ</L>
<L>Sublustrique aliquid dant cernere noctis in umbrâ</L></Q>
<Q><L>Th' event should glimmer with a dubious ray,</L>
<L>Not hid in clouds, nor glare in open day.</L></Q>
This rule he afterwards illustrates by a very happy similitude.
<Q><L>Haud aliter longinqua petit qui forte viator</L>
<L>Maenia, si positas altis in collibus arces</L>
<L>Nunc etiam dubias oculis videt, incipit ultro</L>

<L>Quàm cùm nusquam ullae cernuntur quas adit arces,</L>
<L>Obscurum sed iter tendit convallibus imis.</L></Q>
The conduct both of <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> are agreeable to this ob∣servation;
for instance, <HI>Anchises</HI> and <HI>Tiresias</HI> in the shades, fore∣tel
<HI>Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Ulysses</HI> that all their troubles shall end prospe∣rously,
that the one shall found the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, the other re∣gain
his kingdoms; but the means being kept conceal'd, our ap∣petite
is rather whetted than cloy'd, to know by what means
these events are brought about: Thus, as in <HI>Vida</HI>'s allusion, they
show us the City at a great distance, but how we are to arrive
at it, by what roads they intend to guide us to it, this they keep
conceal'd; the journey discovers it self, and every step we ad∣vance
leads us forward, and shews where we are to take the next;
neither does the Poet directly lead us in the strait path, some∣times
we are as it were in a labyrinth, and we know not how to
extricate our selves out of it; sometimes he carries us into by∣ways,
and we almost lose sight of the direct way, and then sud∣denly
they open into the chief road, and convey us to the jour∣ney's
<PB N="115" REF="113"/>
end. In this consists the skill of the Poet; he must form
probable intricacies, and then solve them probably; he must set

This observation is necessary to be apply'd to all those passages in the

some tasteless Criticks have blam'd, as taking away the curiosity

<HI>Plutarch</HI> in his Treatise upon reading Poems, observes the wis∣dom
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in these instructions: He is the person who is
more immediately injured, yet he not only restrains his own re∣sentment,
but that of <HI>Telemachus:</HI> He perceives that his son is in
danger of flying out into some passion, he therefore very wise∣ly
arms him against it. Men do not put bridles upon
horses when they are already running with full speed, but
they bridle them before they bring them out to the race: This
very well illustrates the conduct of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> he fears the youth of
<HI>Telemachus</HI> may be too warm, and thro' an unseasonable ardour
at the sight of his wrongs, betray him to his enemies; he there∣fore
persuades him to patience and calmness, and pre-disposes
his mind with rational considerations to enable him to encounter
his passions, and govern his resentment.</P>

apartment, and therefore it was rational to conclude that
the arms were in it. The verses are proper in both places;

This injunction of secrecy is introduc'd by <HI>Ulysses</HI> with the utmost
solemnity; and it was very necessary that it should be so; the
whole hopes of his re-establishment depending upon it: Besides,
this behaviour agrees with the character of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> which is re∣markable
for disguise and concealment. The Poet makes a fur∣ther
use of it; namely, to give him an opportunity to describe
at large the several discoveries made to <HI>Penelope, Laertes,</HI> and <HI>Eu∣moeus</HI>
personally by <HI>Ulysses,</HI> in the sequel of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> which
are no small ornaments to it; yet must have been omitted, or
have lost their effect, if the return of <HI>Ulysses</HI> had been made
known by <HI>Telemachus;</HI> this would have been like discovering the

he depend upon it, but by some prodigy from <HI>Jupiter? Eusta∣thius</HI>
thus understands the words; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
And then the meaning will be,
“If the prodigy from <HI>Jupiter</HI> be evident, there is no occasion

that expression imply doubt, and a jealousy, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> might possibly

sailing from the place where <HI>Telemachus</HI> embark'd: For it is ne∣cessary
to remember that <HI>Telemachus</HI> to avoid the Suitors had

are alike: The contrary conduct would make an equal confusion
both in Poetry and Painting, and an indistinction of persons and
characters. I will not promise that these particularities are of
equal beauty, as necessity, especially in modern languages; the
<HI>Greek</HI> is always flowing, sonorous and harmonious; the language,
like leaves, oftentimes conceals barrenness, and a want of fruit,
and renders the sense at least beautiful, if not profitable; this is
wanted in some degree in <HI>English</HI> Poetry, where it is not always
in our power to conceal the nakedness with ornaments: This par∣ticularity

be avoided; the indiscretion of the Herald in speaking aloud,
discovers the return of <HI>Telemachus</HI> to the Suitors, and is the inci∣dent

<P>VERSE 391. <HI>The</HI> Greeks, <HI>averse too justly to our cause.</HI>] This
verse is inserted with great judgment, and gives an air of proba∣bility
to the whole relation; for if it be ask'd why the Suitors
defer to seize the supreme power, and to murder <HI>Telemachus,</HI> they
being so superior in number? <HI>Antinous</HI> himself answers, that they
fear the people, who favour the cause of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and would
revenge his injuries: 'Tis for this reason that they form'd the am∣bush
by sea; and for this reason <HI>Antinous</HI> proposes to intercept
him in his return from the country: they dare not offer open
violence, and therefore make use of treachery. This speech of
<HI>Antinous</HI> forms a short under-plot to the Poem; it gives us pain
(says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) for <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and holds us in suspense till the
intimacy is unravell'd by <HI>Amphinomus.</HI></P>
<P>The whole harangue is admirable in <HI>Homer:</HI> the diction is
excellently suited to the temper of <HI>Antinous,</HI> who speaks with
precipitation: His mind is in agitation and disorder, and con∣sequently
his language is abrupt, and not allowing himself time
to explain his thoughts at full length, he falls into elleipses and
abbreviations. For instance, he is to speak against <HI>Telemachus,</HI>
but his contempt and resentment will not permit him to menti∣on
his name, he therefore calls him <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; thus in <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
is understood; thus likewise in this verse,

the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, must be understood, to
make the sense intelligible. Thus also after <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>

<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to make <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in the next sentence begin it signifi∣cantly,

but you would have him live, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> otherwise <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
must be constru'd like <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and lastly, to image
the disorder of <HI>Antinous</HI> more strongly, <HI>Homer</HI> inserts a false quan∣tity,
by making the first syllable in <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> short. <HI>Antinous</HI> at∣tends
not, thro' the violence of his spirit, to the words he utters,
and therefore falls into this error, which excellently represents it.
It is impossible to retain these Elleipses in the translation, but I
have endeavour'd to show the warmth of the speaker, by put∣ting
the words into Interrogations, which are always utter'd with
vehemence, and signs of hurry and precipitation.</P>

a person of some justice and moderation. At first view, there
seems no reason why the Poet should distinguish <HI>Amphinomus</HI> from
the rest of the Suitors, by giving him this humane character; but
in reality there is an absolute necessity for it. <HI>Telemachus</HI> is doom'd
to die by <HI>Antinous:</HI> here is an intricacy form'd, and how is that
Heroe to be preserv'd with probability? The Poet ascribes a greater
degree of tenderness and moderation to one of the Suitors, and
by this method preserves <HI>Telemachus.</HI> Thus we see the least cir∣cumstance

That is, <HI>Medon</HI> was out of the court, whereas the Suitors form'd
their council within it: The line is really to be suspected; for a
little above, <HI>Homer</HI> directly tells us, that the Suitors left the Pa∣lace.
<Q><L>Then issuing from the dome, before the gate</L>
<L>With clouded looks, a pale assembly sate.</L></Q>
It is likewise very evident that they stood in the open air, for
they discover the ship returning from the ambush, and sailing into
the bay. How then can it be said of the Suitors, that they form'd
their assembly in the court, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Besides,
continues <HI>Dacier,</HI> they left the palace, and placed themselves un∣der
the lofty wall of it.

How then is it possible to see the ship entring the port, when

But all the difficulty vanishes by taking <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as it is frequently

the court, but the court-yard, and this is the proper signification

this is merely conjecture; and 'tis more rational to imagine that
the court-yard was open seaward, that so beautiful a prospect as

it obviously means the blood of the person who offers violence

he adds,
<Q><L>Then fear no mortal arm: if heav'n destroy,</L>

the apparent signification is, that <HI>Telemachus</HI> has occasion only

is particularly tender and affecting: It has some resem∣blance
with that of <HI>Joseph</HI>'s discovery of himself to his brethren,
and it may not perhaps be disagreeable to see how two such Au∣thors
describe the same passion. <HI>I am</HI> Joseph, <HI>I am your brother</HI>
Joseph.

<L>and he wept aloud, and he fell on his brother's neck and wept.</L>

But it must be owned that <HI>Homer</HI> falls infinitely short of <HI>Moses:</HI>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>VERSE</HI> 8. I haste to meet my mother's longing eyes.]</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE are two reasons for the return of
<HI>Telemachus;</HI> one, the duty a son owes to a
mother; the other, to find an opportuni∣ty
to put in execution the designs concert∣ed
with <HI>Ulysses:</HI> the Poet therefore shifts the
scene from the Lodge to the Palace. <HI>Tele∣machus</HI>
takes not <HI>Ulysses</HI> along with him, for
fear he should raise suspicion in the Suitors,
that a person in a beggar's garb has some secret merit, to obtain
the familiarity of a King's son, and this might be an occasion of
a discovery; whereas when <HI>Ulysses</HI> afterwards appears amongst the
Suitors, he is thought to be an entire stranger to <HI>Telemachus,</HI>
which prevents all jealousy, and gives them an opportunity to
carry on their measures without any particular observation. Be∣sides,
<HI>Eumaeus</HI> is still to be kept in ignorance concerning the
person of <HI>Ulysses; Telemachus</HI> therefore gives him a plausible rea∣son
for his return; namely, that his mother may no longer be in
<PB N="168" REF="164"/>
pain for his safety: This likewise excellently contributes to de∣ceive
<HI>Eumaeus.</HI> Now as the presence of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the Palace is
absolutely necessary to bring about the Suitors' destruction, <HI>Te∣lemachus</HI>
orders <HI>Eumaeus</HI> to conduct him thither, and by this me∣thod
he comes as the friend and guest of <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> not of <HI>Telema∣chus:</HI>
Moreover, this injunction was necessary: <HI>Eumaeus</HI> was a per∣son
of such generosity, that he would have thought himself
obliged to detain his guest under his own care and inspection:
nay, before he guides him towards the Palace, in the sequel of
this book, he tells <HI>Ulysses</HI> he does it solely in compliance with
the order of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and acts contrary to his own inclinations.</P>

<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 14. To wipe the tears from all afflicted eyes</L>
<L>My will may covet, but my pow'r denies.]</L></Q>
This might appear too free a declaration, if <HI>Telemachus</HI> had made
it before he knew <HI>Ulysses;</HI> for no circumstance could justify him
for using any disregard toward the poor and stranger, accor∣ding
to the strict notions, and the sanctity, of the laws of ho∣spitality
amongst the ancients: but as the case stands we are not
the least shock'd at the words of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> we know the reason
why he thus speaks: It is to conceal <HI>Ulysses.</HI> He is so far from
shewing any particular regard to him, that he treats him with a
severity in some degree contrary to the laws of hospitality; by
adding, that if he complains of this hard usage, the complaint
will not redress but encrease his calamity.</P>

When <HI>Homer</HI> (remarks that Author) paints a beautiful face, or
an engaging object, he chuses the softest vowels, and most smooth
and flowing semivowels: He never clogs the pronunciation with
rough sounds, and a collision of untunable consonants, but every
syllable, every letter conspires to exhibit the beauty of the ob∣ject
he endeavours to represent: There are no less than three
and thirty vowels in two lines, and no more than twenty nine
consonants, which makes the verses flow away with an agreeable
smoothness and harmony.</P>
<P><HI>Penelope,</HI> we see, embraces her son with the utmost affecti∣on:
<HI>Kissing the lip</HI> was not in fashion in the days of <HI>Homer;
No one</HI> (remarks the Bishop) <HI>ever kisses the lip or mouth.
Penelope</HI> here kisses her son's eyes, and his head; that is,
his cheek, or perhaps forehead: and <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> in the preceding
book, embraces the hands, eyes, and head of <HI>Telemachus.</HI> But for
the comfort of the Ladies, I rejoice to observe that all these
were ceremonious kisses from a mother to a son, or from an
inferior to a superior: This therefore is no argument that lovers
thus embrac'd, nor ought it to be brought as a reason why the
present manner of salutation should be abrogated. Madam <HI>Da∣cier</HI>
has been so tender as to keep it a secret from the men, that
there ever was a time in which the modern method of kis∣sing
was not in fashion; she highly deserves their thanks and gra∣titude
for it.</P>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 65. <HI>A stranger sent by Heav'n attends me there.</HI>]
There is a vein of sincere piety that runs thro' the words and
actions of <HI>Telemachus:</HI> He has no sooner deliver'd his mother
from her uneasy apprehensions concerning his safety, but he pro∣ceeds
to another act of virtue toward <HI>Theoclymenus,</HI> whom he had
<PB N="170" REF="166"/>
taken into his protection: He performs his duty towards men
and towards the Gods. It is by his direction that <HI>Penelope</HI> offers
up her devotions for success, and thanks for his return. It is
he who prescribes the manner of it; namely, by washing the hands,
in token of the purity of mind requir'd by those who suppli∣cate
the Deities; and by putting on clean garments, to shew

discourse, because the Queen was in public with her female at∣tendants:
by this conduct the Poet sustains both their characters;
<HI>Penelope</HI> is impatient to hear of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> and this agrees with the

<HI>Telemachus</HI> forbears to satisfy her curiosity; in which he acts like a

for not satisfying her impatience concerning her husband; she
insinuates that it is a piece of cruelty to permit her still to
grieve, when it is in his power to give her comfort; and this in∣duces
him to gratify her desires. It ought to be observ'd, that
<HI>Homer</HI> chuses a proper time for this relation; it was necessary

it was necessary that <HI>Penelope</HI> should be informed of his return,
why does not <HI>Telemachus</HI> assure her of it, who was fully ac∣quainted

be fully inform'd, but only encourag'd by a general hope: <HI>The∣oclymenus</HI>
speaks from his art, which may possibly be lia∣ble
to error; but <HI>Telemachus</HI> must have spoken from knowledge,

<HI>Dacier</HI> is very singular in her interpretation of this passage: She
imagines it has a reference to the games practis'd amongst the
Suitors, and to the rewards of the victors, which were usually
Tripods and beautiful captives. “Thinkest thou (says <HI>Melan∣thius</HI>)
that this beggar will obtain the victory in our sports,
and that they will give him as the reward of his valour, some
beautiful slave, or some precious Tripod?” But in <HI>Homer</HI> there
is nothing that gives the least countenance to this explication:
He thus literally speaks: This fellow <HI>by going from door to door
will meet with correction, while he begs meanly for a few scraps,
not for things of price, such as a captive or Tripod. Eustathius</HI>
explains it as spoken in contempt of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> that he appears to
be such a vile person, as to have no ambition or hope to expect
any thing better than a few scraps, nor to aspire to the rewards
of nobler strangers, such as captives or Tripods. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, says the same
Author, are the minutest crums of bread, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<PB N="176" REF="172"/>
and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> are governed by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as effectually as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and therefore must refer to the same act of begging, not of claim∣ing
by victory in the games; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is not a word that can here
express a reward, but only a charity: besides, would it not be ab∣surd
to say that a Beggar goes from door to door asking alms, and
not rewards bestow'd upon victors in public exercises? the words
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> make the sense general, they denote the life of a
beggar, which is to go from door to door, and consequently they
ought not to be confin'd solely to the Suitors, and if not, they
can have no reference to any games, or to any rewards bestow'd
upon such occasions. Besides is it scarce to be conceiv'd that <HI>Me∣lanthius</HI>
could think this Beggar capable of being admitted into
the company, much less into the diversions, of the Suitors, who
were all persons of high birth and station? 'Tis true, <HI>Lib.</HI> 21.
<HI>Ulysses</HI> is permitted to try the Bow, but this is thro' the pecu∣liar

the Palace (says that Author) is more proper for a Peasant than
a King; and it is beneath the dignity of Poetry to describe the
Dog <HI>Argus</HI> almost devour'd with vermin.” It must be allow'd,
that such a familiar Episode could not have been properly intro∣duced
into the <HI>Iliad:</HI> It is writ in a nobler style, and distin∣guish'd
by a boldness of sentiments and diction; whereas the
<HI>Odyssey</HI> descends to the Familiar, and is calculated more for com∣mon
than heroic life. What <HI>Homer</HI> says of <HI>Argus</HI> is very natural,
and I do not know any thing more beautiful or more affecting
in the whole Poem: I dare appeal to every person's judgment,
if <HI>Argus</HI> be not as justly and properly represented, as the noblest
figure in it. It is certain that the vermin which <HI>Homer</HI> mentions
would debase our Poetry, but in the <HI>Greek</HI> that very word is no∣ble
and sonorous, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: But how is the objection con∣cerning
the Dunghil to be answer'd? We must have recourse to
the simplicity of manners amongst the Ancients, who thought
nothing mean that was of use to life. <HI>Ithaca</HI> was a barren Coun∣try,
full of Rocks and Mountains, and owed its fertility chiefly
to cultivation, and for this reason such circumstantial cares were
necessary. 'Tis true such a description now is more proper for a

from its growth, but make it less by the constriction. It is
observable that all the great Orators flourish'd in Republics, and
indeed, what is there that raises the souls of great men more
than Liberty? In other governments men commonly become,
instead of Orators, pompous flatterers: A man born in servi∣tude
may be capable of other sciences; but no slave can ever
be an Orator; for while the mind is deprest and broken by
slavery, it will never dare to think or say any thing bold and
noble; all the vigour evaporates, and it remains as it were

<P>A person of great learning has observ'd that there is a tautology
in the three last words; in <HI>a beggar that wants;</HI> as if the very noti∣on
of a beggar did not imply want. Indeed <HI>Plato,</HI> who cites this
verse in his <HI>Charmides,</HI> uses another word instead of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and in∣serts
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Hesiod</HI> likewise, who makes use of the same line, in∣stead
of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> reads <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which would almost induce us to be∣lieve
that they thought there was a tautology in <HI>Homer.</HI> It has

in the place of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; I am sorry that the construction
will not allow it; that word is of the masculine gender, and
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which is of the feminine cannot agree with it. We may
indeed substitute <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and then the sense will be <HI>Bashfulness

authority. We must therefore thus understand <HI>Homer;</HI> “Too
much modesty is not good for a poor man, who lives by beg∣ging,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and this solution clears the verse from tauto∣logy,

<P>VERSE 432. Minerva <HI>prompts,</HI> &amp;c.] This is a circum∣stance
that occurs almost in every book of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> and <HI>Pal∣las</HI>
has been thought to mean no more than the inherent wis∣dom
of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> which guides all his actions upon all emergen∣cies:
It is not impossible but the Poet might intend to inculcate,
that the wisdom of man is the gift of Heaven, and a blessing
from the Gods. But then is it not a derogation to <HI>Ulysses,</HI> to
think nothing but what the Goddess dictates? and a restraint of
human liberty, to act solely by the impulse of a Deity? <HI>Plutarch</HI>
in his life of <HI>Coriolanus</HI> excellently solves this difficulty. “Men
(observes that Author) are ready to censure and despise the Poet,
as if he destroy'd the use of reason, and the freedom of their
choice, by continually ascribing every suggestion of heart to
the influence of a Goddess: Whereas he introduces a Deity
not to take away the liberty of the will, but as moving it
to act with freedom; the Deity does not work in us the in∣clinations,
but only offers the object to our minds, from
whence we conceive the impulse, and form our resolutions.”
However these influences do not make the action involuntary,
but only give a beginning to spontaneous operations; for we
must either remove God from all manner of causality, or con∣fess
that he invisibly assists us by a secret co-operation. For it is
absurd to imagine that the help he lends us, consists in fashio∣ning
the postures of the body, or directing the corporeal moti∣ons;
but in influencing our souls, and exciting the inward facul∣ties
into action by secret impulses from above; or on the con∣trary,
by raising an aversion in the soul, to restrain us from action.
'Tis true in ordinary affairs of life, in matters that are brought
about by the ordinary way of reason, <HI>Homer</HI> ascribes the execu∣tion
of them to human performance, and frequently represents
his Heroes calling a council in their own breasts, and acting ac∣cording
to the dictates of reason: But in actions unaccountably
daring, of a transcendent nature, there they are said to be car∣ry'd
<PB N="184" REF="180"/>
away by a divine impulse or enthusiasm, and it is no longer
human reason, but a God that influences the soul.</P>
<P>I have already observed, that <HI>Homer</HI> makes use of Ma∣chines
sometimes meerly for ornament; this place is an instance
of it: Here is no action of an uncommon nature perform'd,
and yet <HI>Pallas</HI> directs <HI>Ulysses: Plutarch</HI> very justly observes, that
whenever the Heroes of <HI>Homer</HI> execute any prodigious exploit of
valour, he continually introduces a Deity, who assists in the per∣formance
of it; but it is also true, that to shew the dependance
of man upon the assistance of Heaven, he frequently ascribes
the common dictates of wisdom to the Goddess of it. If we
take the act here inspired by <HI>Minerva,</HI> as it lies nakedly in <HI>Homer,</HI>
it is no more than a bare command to beg; an act, that needs
not the wisdom of a Goddess to command: But we are to un∣derstand
it as a direction to <HI>Ulysses</HI> how to behave before the
Suitors upon his first appearance, how to carry on his disguise
so artfully as to prevent all suspicions, and take his measures so
effectually as to work his own re-establishment: In this light,
the command becomes worthy of a Goddess: The act of beg∣ging
is only the method by which he carries on his designs; the
consequence of it is the main point in view, namely, the Suitors
destruction. The rest is only the stratagem, by which he ob∣tains
the victory.</P>

inadvertent, or had forgot the former relation, and yet asserts that
the reason why <HI>Ulysses</HI> tells the same History in part to <HI>Antinous,</HI>
proceeds from a fear of detection in <HI>Eumaeus.</HI> I would rather ima∣gine

why he forbears to let <HI>Antinous</HI> into the full History of his life;

We are not to search too exactly into historic truth among the

<P>VERSE 557. <HI>Not for the hurt I grieve, but for the cause.</HI>]
The reasoning of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the original is not without some ob∣scurity:
For how can it be affirm'd, that it is no great affliction
to have our property invaded, and to be wounded in the de∣fence
of it? The beggar who suffers for asking an alms, has no
injury done him, except the violence offer'd to his person; but
it is a double injury, to suffer both in our persons and proper∣ties.
We must therefore suppose that <HI>Ulysses</HI> means, that the
importance of the cause, when our rights are invaded, is equal
to the danger, and that we ought to suffer wounds, or even
death, in defence of it; and that a brave man grieves not at such
laudable adventures. Or perhaps <HI>Ulysses</HI> speaks only with respect
to <HI>Antinous,</HI> and means that it is a greater injury to offer vio∣lence
to the poor and the stranger, than to persons of greater
fortunes and station.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> gives a deeper meaning to the speech of <HI>Ulysses;</HI>
he applies it to his present condition, and it is the same as if
he had said openly, It would be no great matter if I had been
wounded in defence of my Palace, and other properties, but to
suffer only for asking an alms, this is a deep affliction. So that
<HI>Ulysses</HI> speaks in general, but intends his own particular conditi∣on;
and the import of the whole is, I grieve to suffer, not upon
any weighty account, but only for being poor and hungry.</P>

utter'd these words, <HI>Telemachus</HI> sneezes; <HI>Penelope</HI> accepts the omen,
and expects the words to be verify'd. The original of the veneration
paid to sneezing is this: The head is the most sacred part of the
body, the seat of thought and reason: now the sneeze coming
from the head, the Ancients look'd upon it as a sign or omen,
and believ'd it to be sent by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> therefore they regarded
it with a kind of adoration: The Reader will have a full idea
of the nature of the omen of sneezing here mention'd, from a
singular instance in <HI>lib.</HI> 3. of <HI>Xenophon,</HI> in his expedition of <HI>Cy∣rus.
Xenophon</HI> having ended a short speech to his soldiers with
<PB N="190" REF="186"/>
these words, <HI>viz.</HI> “We have many reasons to hope for preser∣vation;.” they were scarce utter'd, when a certain soldier
sneez'd: the whole army took the omen▪ and at once paid ado∣ration
to the Gods; then <HI>Xenophon</HI> resuming his discourse, pro∣ceeded,
“Since, my fellow-soldiers, at the mention of our pre∣servation,
<HI>Jupiter</HI> has sent this omen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>” So that <HI>Xenophon</HI>
fully explains <HI>Homer.</HI> Sneezing was likewise reckon'd ominous
by the <HI>Romans.</HI> Thus <HI>Catullus,</HI>
<Q><L>Hoc ut dixit, Amor sinistra ut ante</L>
<L>Dextram sternuit adprobationem.</L></Q>
Thus also <HI>Propertius,</HI>
<Q><L>Num tibi nascenti primis, mea vita, diebus</L>
<L>Aridus argutum sternuit omen amor.</L></Q>
We find in all these instances that sneezing was constantly re∣ceiv'd
as a good omen, or a sign of approbation from the Gods.
In these ages we pay an idle superstition to sneezing, but it is
ever look'd upon as a bad omen, and we cry <HI>God bless you,</HI> upon
hearing it, as the <HI>Greeks</HI> in latter times said <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
We are told this custom arose from a mortal distemper that affe∣cted
the head, and threw the patient into convulsive sneezings,
that occasion'd his death.</P>
<P>I will only add from <HI>Eustathius,</HI> that <HI>Homer</HI> expresses the loud∣ness
of the sneezing, to give a reason why <HI>Penelope</HI> heard it, she
being in an apartment at some distance from <HI>Telemachus.</HI></P>
<P>The sneezing likewise gives us the reason why <HI>Penelope</HI> imme∣diately
commands <HI>Eumaeus</HI> to introduce the beggar into her pre∣sence;
the omen gave her hopes to hear of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> she saw the
beggar was a stranger, and a traveller, and therefore expected he

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
EIGHTEENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_<HI>HOMER</HI> has been severely blam'd for describing
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> a King, entring the lists with a beg∣gar:
<HI>Rapin</HI> affirms, that he demeans himself
by engaging with an unequal adversary.
The objection would be unanswerable, if
<HI>Ulysses</HI> appear'd in his royal character: But
it is as necessary in Epic Poetry as on the
Theatre, to adapt the behaviour of every
person to the character he is to represent, whether real or imagi∣nary.
Would it not have been ridiculous to have represented
him, while he was disguis'd in the garb of a beggar, refusing the
combat, because he knew himself to be a King? and would not
such a conduct have endanger'd a discovery? Ought we not ra∣ther
to look upon this Episode as an instance of the greatness of
the calamities of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who is reduced to such uncommon ex∣tremities
as to be set upon a level with the meanest of wretches?</P>

<P>VERSE 8. <HI>She nam'd</HI> Arnaeus—] It seems probable from
this passage, that the mother gave the name to the child in the
days of <HI>Homer;</HI> tho' perhaps not without the concurrence of the
father: Thus in the scriptures it is said of <HI>Leah,</HI> that <HI>she bare a
son and called his name Reuben;</HI> and again, <HI>she called his name Simeon;</HI>
and the same is frequently repeated both of <HI>Leah</HI> and <HI>Rachel.</HI> In
the age of <HI>Aristophanes,</HI> the giving a name to the child seems to
have been a divided prerogative between the father and mother:
For in his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> there is a dispute between <HI>Strepsiades</HI> and his
wife, concerning the name of their son: The wife was of noble
birth, and would therefore give him a noble name; the husband
was a plain villager, and was rather for a name that denoted
frugality: but the woman not waving the least branch of her
prerogative, they compromis'd the affair, by giving the child a
compounded name that imply'd both frugality and chivalry, deri∣ved
from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>to spare,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>an horse;</HI> and the young
Cavalier's name was <HI>Phidippides. Eustathius</HI> affirms, that anciently
the mother nam'd the child; and the Scholiast upon <HI>Aristophanes</HI>
in <HI>avib.</HI> quotes a fragment from <HI>Euripides</HI> to this purpose, from
a Play call'd <HI>Aegeus.</HI>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
<HI>What was the name given on the tenth day by the mother to the
child? Dacier</HI> tells us, that the name of <HI>Arnaeus</HI> was prophetic
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>from the sheep the glutton would devour when he
came to manhood;</HI> but this is mere fancy, and it is no reason be∣cause
he prov'd a glutton, that therefore the name foretold it:
One might rather think the fondness of the mother toward her
infant, suggested a very different view: She gave the name ac∣cording
to her wishes, and flatter'd herself that he would prove
a very rich man, <HI>a man of many flocks or herds;</HI> and therefore she
call'd him <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: and this is the more probable, because all
riches originally consisted in flocks and herds.</P>

These words refer to a custom that prevailed in former ages; it

found in his grounds: <HI>Eustathius</HI> informs us, that this was a cu∣stom

<P>VERSE 37. <HI>Gird well thy loins.</HI>] We may gather from
hence the manner of the single combat; the champions fought
naked, and only made use of a cincture round the loins out of de∣cency.
<HI>Homer</HI> directly affirms it, when <HI>Ulysses</HI> prepares for the
fight.
<Q><L>Then girding his strong loins, the King prepares</L>
<L>To close in combat, and his body bares;</L>
<L>Broad spread his shoulders, and his nervous thighs</L>

This is a very necessary precaution: <HI>Ulysses</HI> had reason to appre∣hend
that the Suitors would interest themselves in the cause of
<HI>Irus,</HI> who was their daily attendant, rather than in that of a
perfect stranger. <HI>Homer</HI> takes care to point out the prudence
of <HI>Ulysses</HI> upon every emergence: Besides, he raises this fray
between two beggars into some dignity, by requiring the sanction
of an oath to regulate the laws of the combat. It is the same
solemnity used in the <HI>Iliad</HI> between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Menelaus,</HI> and re∣presents
these combatants engaging with the formality of two

When <HI>Telemachus</HI> speaks these words, he is to be suppos'd to turn

It must be allow'd that this is an artful piece of flattery in

<P>VERSE 82. Irus, <HI>alas! shall</HI> Irus <HI>be no more.</HI>] This is lite∣rally
translated: I confess I wish <HI>Homer</HI> had omitted these little
collusions of words: he sports with <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It is a low
conceit, alluding to the derivation of <HI>Irus,</HI> and means that he
shall never more be <HI>a messenger.</HI> The translation, tho' it
be verbal, yet is free from ambiguity, and the joke con∣cealed
in <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: this will be evident if we substitute another

<HI>Eustathius</HI> gives us an instance of the deep penetration of some
Critics, in their comments upon these words; they have found
in them the Philosophy of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and the transmigration of
Souls. The verse thus stands in <HI>Homer,</HI>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</Q>
which they imagine is to be understood after this manner; <HI>I
wish thou hadst never been born! and mayst thou never exist again,
or have a second being!</HI> To recite such an absurdity, is to refute
it. The verse when literally render'd bears this import; <HI>I wish
thou wert now dead, or hadst never been born!</HI> an imprecation
very natural to persons in anger, who seldom give themselves
time to speak with profound allusions to Philosophy.</P>

The tradition concerning <HI>Echetus</HI> stands thus: he was King
of <HI>Epirus,</HI> the son of <HI>Euchenor</HI> and <HI>Phlogea;</HI> he had a daugh∣ter
called <HI>Metopè,</HI> or as others affirm <HI>Amphissa;</HI> she being
corrupted by <HI>Aechmodicus, Echetus</HI> put out her eyes, and condem∣ned
her to grind pieces of iron made in the resemblance of corn,
and told her she should recover her sight when she had ground
the iron into flour. He invited <HI>Aechmodicus</HI> to an entertainment,
and cut off the extremities from all parts of his body, and cast
them to the dogs; at length being seiz'd with madness, he fed

I wonder how this last quotation escap'd the diligence of <HI>Eustathi∣us.
Dacier</HI> affirms, that no mention is made of <HI>Echetus</HI> by any
of the <HI>Greek</HI> Historians, and therefore she has recourse to another
tradition, preserv'd by <HI>Eustathius,</HI> who tells us, that <HI>Echetus</HI> was
contemporary with <HI>Homer,</HI> that the Poet had been ill us'd by
him, and therefore took this revenge for his inhumanity.</P>

But there is undoubtedly an error in <HI>Hesychius;</HI> instead of
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> we should read <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, <HI>meager,</HI> or a <HI>stomach

<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 165. <HI>Then hear my words, and grave them in thy mind.</HI>]
There never was a finer lecture of Morality read in any of the
schools of the Philosophers, than this which <HI>Ulysses</HI> delivers to
<HI>Amphinomus;</HI> he ushers it in with great solemnity, and speaks to
all mankind in the person of <HI>Amphinomus.</HI> It is quoted by a
variety of Authors; <HI>Pliny</HI> in his Preface to his natural History,
<HI>lib.</HI> 7. has wrote a dissertation on this sentence.
<Q><L>Of all that breathes or grov'ling creeps on earth</L>
<L>Most vain is Man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> quote it; and <HI>Plutarch</HI> twice refers
to it. <HI>Homer</HI> considers Man both with respect to the errors of the
mind, and the calamities incident to the body; and upon a re∣view
of all mortal creatures, he attributes to man the un∣happy
superiority in miseries. But indeed <HI>Homer</HI> is so plain
that he needs no interpretation, and any words but his own
must disgrace him. Besides, this speech is beautiful in ano∣ther
view, and excellently sets forth the forgiving temper of
<HI>Ulysses:</HI> He saw that all the sparks of virtue and humanity
were not extinguish'd in <HI>Amphinomus;</HI> he therefore warns him
with great solemnity to forsake the Suitors; he imprints con∣viction
upon his mind, tho' ineffectually, and shews by it that
when he falls by the hand of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the succeeding parts of
the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> his death is not a revenge, but a punishment.</P>

<DIV2 N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 163. <HI>For man is changeful as his bliss or woe.</HI>] Most

<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q>
They thus translate it, <HI>talis mens hominum, qualem deus suggerit;</HI>
or “Such is the mind of man, as Heav'n inspires:” but this
is an error, for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> cannot refer to <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, but to <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and the
sentence is thus to be render'd, <HI>Talis mens hominum, qualem diem
deus inducit;</HI> that is, “The mind of man changes with the com∣plexion
of the day, as heaven sends happiness or misery;” or
as in the translation,
<Q><L>For man is changeful as his bliss or woe,</L>
<L>Too high when prosp'rous, when distress'd too low.</L></Q>
The Reader will be convinc'd that the construction requires this
sense, by joyning the praeposition with the verb, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> with <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and rendring it, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; nothing being more fre∣quent
than such a division of the praeposition from the verb
amongst the <HI>Greeks.</HI> It must be allow'd, that <HI>Homer</HI> gives a
very unhappy, yet too just a picture, of human nature:
Man is too apt to be proud and insolent in prosperity, and
mean and abject in adversity; and those men who are most over∣bearing
in an happy state, are always most base and mean in
the day of affliction.</P>

<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 189. <HI>With flattering hopes the Suitors to betray.</HI>] The
<HI>Greek</HI> is very concise, and the expression uncommon, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;
that is, <HI>Penelope</HI> thus acted that she might
<HI>dilate the heart of the Suitors;</HI> meaning (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes)
that she might give them false hopes by appearing in their com∣pany:
for the heart shrinks and is contracted by sorrow and de∣spair,
and is again dilated by hope or joy: This is I believe lite∣rally
true, the spirits flow briskly when we are in joy, and
<PB N="231" REF="224"/>
a new pulse is given to the blood, which necessarily must dilate
the heart: On the contrary, when we are in sorrow the spirits
are languid, and the blood moves less actively; and therefore the
heart shrinks and contracts, the blood wanting vigour to dilate
and expand it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 191. <HI>Thy husband's wonder, and thy son's, to raise.</HI>]
This is solely the act of <HI>Minerva;</HI> for <HI>Penelope</HI> is ignorant that
she is to appear before her husband. This interview is excellent∣ly
manag'd by <HI>Homer: Ulysses</HI> is to be convinced of his wife's
fidelity; to bring this about, he introduces her upon the public
stage, where her husband stands as a common unconcerned spe∣ctator,
and hears her express her love for him in the warmest
terms: here is no room for art or design, because she is igno∣rant
that she speaks before <HI>Ulysses;</HI> and therefore her words must
be suppos'd to proceed from the heart. This gives us a reason
why <HI>Homer</HI> makes her dwell at large upon her passion for <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
and paint it in the strongest colours, <HI>viz.</HI> to evidence her cha∣stity,
and urge <HI>Ulysses</HI> to hasten the destruction of the Suitors,
by convincing him that she is able no longer to elude the mar∣riage
hour. But then it may be objected, if <HI>Penelope's</HI> sole de∣sign
was to give a false hope to the Suitors, does she not take
a very wrong method, by speaking so very tenderly of <HI>Ulysses?</HI>
is not this a more probable reason for despair, than hope? It is
true, it would have been so, if in the conclusion of her speech she
had not artfully added
<Q><L>But when my son grows man, the royal sway</L>
<L>Resign, and happy be thy bridal day!</L></Q>
So that <HI>Telemachus</HI> being now grown up to maturity, the Suitors
concluded that the nuptial hour was at hand. If then we consi∣der
the whole conduct of <HI>Penelope</HI> in this book, it must be al∣low'd
to be very refin'd and artful; she observes a due regard to∣wards
<PB N="232" REF="225"/>
<HI>Ulysses,</HI> by shewing she is not to be persuaded to marry;
and yet by the same words she gives the Suitors hopes that the
day is almost come when she intends to celebrate her nuptials;
she manages so dextrously, as to persuade without a promise;
and for this reason the words are put into the mouth of <HI>Ulysses,</HI>
and it is <HI>Ulysses</HI> who gives the hopes, rather than <HI>Penelope.</HI></P>

I am not certain that this is the exact sense of <HI>Homer; Dacier</HI> un∣derstands
him very differently. <HI>Eurynomè</HI> (observes that Author)
is not endeavouring to comfort <HI>Penelope</HI> because her son is now
come to years of maturity; her purpose is, to shew the necessity
she has to have recourse to art, to assist her beauty: For (adds
she) your son is grown a man; meaning that a Lady who has a
son twenty years old, must have lost her natural beauty, and
has occasion to be oblig'd to art to give her an artificial one.
This I confess is too true, but it seems a little too ludicrous
for Epic Poetry; I have follow'd a different sense, that gives us
a far nobler image; conformable to that verse of <HI>Horace.</HI>

The original says, <HI>resign the Palace to</HI> Telemachus: this is
spoken according to the customs of Antiquity: The wise, upon
her second marriage, being oblig'd to resign the house to the
heir of the family. This circumstance is inserted with great
judgment: the Suitors were determin'd to seize it upon marriage
with <HI>Penelope,</HI> as appears from the second <HI>Odyssey.</HI>
<Q><L>What mighty labours would he then create,</L>
<L>To seize his treasures, and divide his state,</L>

<HI>Penelope</HI> therefore by this declaration gives the Suitors to under∣stand,
that the Palace belong'd not to her, but <HI>Telemachus.</HI> This
assertion has a double effect; it is intended to make the Suitors
less warm in their addresses; or if they persist, to set the inju∣stice
done to <HI>Telemachus</HI> in open view. The beauty of all the
speeches of <HI>Penelope</HI> in this book is so obvious that it needs no
explanation; <HI>Homer</HI> gives her a very amiable character, she is good
in every relation of life, merciful to the poor and stranger, a ten∣der
mother, and an affectionate wife; every period is almost a
lecture of morality.

This conduct may appear somewhat extraordinary both in <HI>Pene∣lope</HI>
and <HI>Ulysses;</HI> she not only takes, but asks presents from per∣sons
whom she never intends to marry: Is not this a sign either
of avarice or falshood? and is not <HI>Ulysses</HI> equally guilty, who re∣joices
at it? But in reality, <HI>Penelope</HI> is no way faulty; she deceives
the Suitors with hopes of marriage by accepting these presents,
but it is for this sole reason that she accepts them; she intends to
give them false hopes, and by that method to defer the nuptial
hour: It is not injustice, but an equitable reprisal; they had vi∣olently
wasted her treasures, and she artfully recovers part of
them by a piece of refin'd management. <HI>Dacier</HI> defends her af∣ter
another method: she believes that <HI>Penelope</HI> thus acts, not out
of interest but honour; it was a disgrace to so great a Princess
to have so many admirers, and never to receive from their hands
such presents as custom not only allows, but commands; nei∣ther
is <HI>Ulysses</HI> blameable, who rejoices at his wife's policy. He un∣derstood
her intent, and being artful himself, smiles to see her
artfulness.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> in his treatise of reading Poems, vindicates <HI>Ulysses</HI> ve∣ry
much in the same way: If (says that Author) <HI>Ulysses</HI> rejoiced
at <HI>Penelope's</HI> art in drawing presents from the Suitors out of ava∣rice,
he discovers himself to be a sordid prostitutor of his wife;
but if thro' a wise foresight he hop'd by her acceptance of the
presents, to get the Suitors more into his power, by lulling them
into security, and laying all their suspicions asleep, thro' a sudden
prospect of marriage; if this occasion'd his joy, this joy arising
from her artful management, and from a full confidence in his
wife, is no way blameable, but proceeds from a sufficient and
laudable cause. In short, the Suitors were enemies, and nothing
<PB N="238" REF="231"/>
could be practis'd dishonourably against them, that either <HI>Ulysses</HI>

dignity of Epic Poetry: It is no defence to say that they are men∣tion'd

words are address'd to a Prince, and suppose that a skill in such
works was not unusual to persons of eminent stations; other∣wise
the challenge of <HI>Ulysses</HI> is ridiculously absurd. Who could for∣bear
laughing, if he should hear one of our beggars challenge a
Peer, to plow or mow with him all day without eating? The truth
is, the greatest persons follow'd such employments without any di∣minution
of their dignities; nay, a skill in such works as Agriculture
was a glory even to a King: <HI>Homer</HI> here places it upon a level with
military science, and the knowledge of the cultivation of the
ground is equall'd to glory in war. In the preface to the Pasto∣rals
of <HI>Virgil</HI> (but not written by Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>) there is a passage
that shews that the same simplicity of manners prevail'd amongst
the Ancient <HI>Latins,</HI> as amongst the Ancient <HI>Greeks:</HI> “It ought
not (says that Author) to surprize a modern writer, that Kings
laid down their first rudiments of government in tending their

strange that the master of the horse to King <HI>Latinus</HI> in the ninth

when news of the first skirmish between the <HI>Trojans</HI> and <HI>La∣tins</HI>

and shews that such employments were no dishonour to the

not taken from the ninth, but seventh <HI>Aeneid;</HI> nor is <HI>Tyrrheus,</HI>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE scene still continues in the Palace of <HI>U∣lysses;</HI>
but new persons are introduc'd to
carry on the action, and diversify the story;
This book opens with a repetition from the
sixteenth; the Ancients mark'd it with an
Asterism, without any Obelisk, to shew that
it was here inserted with propriety: As we
draw nearer to the conclusion of the Poem,
the repetitions are more frequent. <HI>Virgil</HI> has generally avoided them,
and indeed it may be observ'd, that these two Poets differ in nothing
more than the manner of their elocution; <HI>Virgil</HI> is full, but <HI>Homer</HI>
even overflows; and this agrees with their general characters. <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
is like those Painters of whom <HI>Apelles</HI> used to complain, that
they left nothing to be imagined by the spectator, and made too
accurate representations; but <HI>Virgil</HI> is like <HI>Timantes</HI> in <HI>Pliny. Ti∣manti
plurimum adfuit ingenii, in omnibus operibus ejus intelligitur
<PB N="292" REF="280"/>
plus semper quam pingitur:</HI> and again, <HI>ostendit etiam quae oc∣cultat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> observes, that the unexpected opportunity to remove
the arms in the absence of the Suitors, occasions this repetition;
In the sixteenth book <HI>Ulysses</HI> told <HI>Telemachus</HI> he would give a
sign when he should make the removal, despairing of an oppor∣tunity
to give a public direction, without danger from the Suitors;
he therefore wisely lays hold of the present hour which happily
favours his desires, and injoyns the arms to be remov'd imme∣diately.</P>

It is not without sufficient reason that <HI>Telemachus</HI> distrusts the
maids; many of them were in the interest of the Suitors; it
was therefore necessary to conceal the place to which the arms
were convey'd, lest they should betray the secret.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 38. <HI>Minerva—with her golden lamp</HI>—] The
office here ascrib'd to <HI>Minerva</HI> gave great offence to <HI>Rapin,</HI> and
he censur'd it as mean, and unworthy of the Goddess; but <HI>Eusta∣thius</HI>
fully vindicates <HI>Homer; Pallas</HI> is here an allegorical Deity
intended by the Poet to express the wisdom of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> he acts
with as much prudence as if <HI>Minerva</HI> herself guided him in all
his ways. We are to gather from this description, that <HI>Ulysses</HI>
form'd all the actions of this night with the utmost wisdom, or
according to the <HI>Greek</HI> proverb, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>counsels
of this night</HI> were regulated with the exactest prudence and secresy.
<HI>Spondanus</HI> observes, that <HI>Callimachus,</HI> a statuary in <HI>Athens,</HI> made
an image of <HI>Minerva</HI> according to this picture in <HI>Homer:</HI> She
<PB N="293" REF="281"/>
held a lamp of gold, which was fill'd with an oil of such an un∣wasting
nature, as not to want to be replenish'd in the space of
a whole year. See <HI>lib.</HI> 1. of <HI>Pausanias. Dacier</HI> judges, that tho'
a lamp was unknown in the days of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> yet it might not be
so in the days of <HI>Homer,</HI> and therefore he might speak of it; for
instance, the trumpet was not known in the <HI>Trojan</HI> war, yet <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
mentions it, because it was used in his age. But this is no
answer; for <HI>Homer</HI> does not say that the trumpet was used during
the siege of <HI>Troy;</HI> if he had, he would have been guilty of a gross
Anachronism, but he speaks of it by way of allusion, as a thing
well known in his time. Here therefore the case is different, for
<HI>Ulysses</HI> is the person who is suppos'd to make use of this lamp,
and <HI>Dacier</HI> allows that it was unknown in his age, and conse∣quently
he ought not to use it at all. It may therefore
perhaps be most probable, that <HI>Callimachus</HI> did not form his sta∣tue
from this original; or if this be not allow'd, that he fell in∣to
an error, and gave the Goddess a lamp instead of a torch.</P>
<P>I will only further add, that this office of <HI>Minerva</HI> may be
vindicated from all meanness, by observing that it is not the bare
act of carrying the torch which the Goddess here executes; she
improves it into a Miracle; the whole Palace is enlighten'd with a
celestial fire, and <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Telemachus</HI> gather full assurances of
her favour and success from that miraculous illumination: this
circumstance raises the description out of lowness into dignity.</P>

<P>VERSE 48. <HI>Some visitant of pure etherial race.] Eustathius</HI>
gives us a twofold explication of these words,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q>
They imply either that the Goddess <HI>Themis</HI> descended; or that it
is the custom of celestial powers to manifest themselves in such
illuminations, without appearing visibly. The latter interpretation
<PB N="294" REF="282"/>

it may therefore be said with great propriety that it is owing to

<Q><HI>Crete</HI>'s hundred cities pour forth all her sons.</Q>

judges that ten cities were built by the <HI>Dorians</HI> after the

<HI>Crete</HI> as having only ninety: But this opinion carries no
probability. Others affirm, that ten cities were demolish'd by the

The truth is, <HI>Homer</HI> does not affirm that there were an hundred
cities in the time of the war with <HI>Troy,</HI> but in his own age;
(for the Poet in that place speaks in his own person) if he had
put the words into the mouth of any one who had liv'd in the
time of the war, he would not have call'd it the Isle of the
hundred, but ninety cities, according to this description of <HI>Ulysses;</HI>
it being very improbable, that ten of the <HI>Cretan</HI> cities should be
destroy'd, either during the war, or after the return of <HI>Idome∣neus;</HI>

<P>VERSE 262, &amp;c. <HI>A robe of military purple,</HI> &amp;c.] This is
a remarkable passage, and gives us an exact description of the ha∣bit
of a King in the days of <HI>Homer,</HI> or perhaps still earlier in the
days of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> Purple seems anciently to have been appropria∣ted
to Kings, and to them on whom they bestow'd it; thus <HI>Judges</HI>
viii. 26. the sacred Historian mentions purple rayment that was on
the Kings of <HI>Midian.</HI> Thus <HI>Esther</HI> viii. 15. a garment of fine linnen
and purple is given to a favourite by King <HI>Ahasuerus;</HI> and 1 <HI>Mac∣cabees</HI>
xliii. the <HI>Jews</HI> made a decree, that <HI>Simon</HI> should wear
purple and gold, and that none of the people should wear pur∣ple
or a <HI>buckle</HI> of gold without his permission, in token that he
was the chief magistate of the <HI>Jews;</HI> thus also <HI>Mac.</HI> x. 89. <HI>A∣lexander</HI>
sent <HI>Jonathan</HI> a buckle of gold, as the use is to be given
to such as are of the King's blood. <HI>Ulysses</HI> is here drest much
after the same manner; he wears purple, and a buckle or clasp
of gold, as a sign of his regality. But what I would chiefly ob∣serve
is, that the art of embroidery was known in these early
ages, nay perhaps was in greater perfection than at this day;
the embroidery was of divers colours, as we may gather from the
epithet apply'd to the fawn, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Some persons indeed tell
us, that this was inwoven into the cloth, and was made in
the loom, but the words of <HI>Homer</HI> will admit of the other inter∣pretation,
and it is evident that embroidery was known amongst
the Orientals in the age of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> from <HI>Judges</HI> v. 20. <HI>Have
they not sped? have they not divided the prey, to Sisera a prey of
divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needle-work, of di∣vers
colours of needle-work on both sides, meet for the necks of
them that take the spoil?</HI> Here is evidently mention made of em∣broidery,
and perhaps such was this robe of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> but how∣ever
this be, it is manifest that all manner of creatures were fi∣gur'd
upon the habit of great personages, and that those creatures
were inwrought so naturally as to seem to be alive.</P>

<P>VERSE 363. <HI>Now wash the stranger,</HI> &amp;c.] This was one
of the first rites of hospitality observ'd towards strangers, amongst
the Ancients; the scriptures abound with instances of it: <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
offers water to wash the feet of the Angels whom he mustook
for strangers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There was also a bath for the stranger, but
this seems to have been a greater honour (as <HI>Dacier</HI> observes) than
that of washing the feet; this may be gather'd from the manner
in which it was perform'd; the daughters of the family, even
young Princesses, assisted at the bath; but the washing the feet
was an office committed to servants: Thus the daughter of <HI>Ne∣stor</HI>
in the third <HI>Odyssey</HI> bath'd <HI>Telemachus,</HI> but <HI>Ulysses</HI> being dis∣guis'd
like a beggar, <HI>Euryclea</HI> washes his feet. This agrees exactly
with another passage of scripture; when <HI>David</HI> sent to ask <HI>Aba∣gail</HI>
to wife. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxv. 41. she made answer, <HI>Let thine hand∣maid
be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my Lord.</HI> My
memory fails me, if there be any other passage, either in the <HI>Ili∣ad</HI>
or <HI>Odyssey,</HI> where this practice of washing the feet is directly
mentioned; the reason is, this was an office perform'd only to
inferior persons; the bath was for Heroes and Kings. Now both
<HI>Homer</HI>'s Poems are fill'd with the characters of such personages,
and therefore there was no room to mention it in other places:
'tis true, the word here is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and does not necessarily
<PB N="306" REF="296"/>
imply the washing of the feet, but washing in general: yet here

<P>VERSE 399. <HI>But if, in tract of long experience,</HI> &amp;c.] I will
have an old woman to wash me (says <HI>Ulysses.</HI>) The reason of this
request is not evident at first view; but <HI>Eustathius</HI> explains it
by shewing that <HI>Ulysses</HI> acts thus to avoid the insults and contempt
of the younger damsels of <HI>Penelope,</HI> who had sufficiently outrag'd
him in this and the preceding book; they would think them∣selves
degraded by performing such an office to a beggar. <HI>Eusta∣thius</HI>
remarks, that some ancient Critics rejected three verses here:
It is absurd, say they, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> should chuse <HI>Euryclea</HI> for this
office, who was the only person who could discover him, and ruin
his designs; he knew she was acquainted with the wound that
afterwards discovers him: But the truth is, <HI>Ulysses</HI> knew <HI>Eu∣ryclea</HI>
to be a person of wisdom, and he was in hopes to draw
her over to his interest, and make use of her in his affairs in
the future parts of the <HI>Odyssey;</HI> and this he does upon many im∣portant
occasions, in particular in locking up the Palace at the
time of the battle between him and the Suitors; so that by her
means he prevents the report of that great incident from being
<PB N="307" REF="297"/>
carried to their partizans abroad: here therefore he artfully brings
it about, that <HI>Euryclea</HI> should be assign'd to this office, not only
to avoid the insults of the other females, but to make use of
her faithfulness and wisdom to carry on his designs, and make
the way more easy to the Suitors' destruction. The choice there∣fore
was prudent; she was aged, and acquainted with human
miseries, not only by reason of her age, but had herself suffer'd
in all the afflictions of <HI>Penelope</HI> and <HI>Telemachus:</HI> we find she is
describ'd as a mother to the whole family, and she all along a∣dopts
the afflictions of it: <HI>Eustathius</HI> therefore may perhaps be
mistaken when he asserts this to be an instance of ill counsels
crown'd with good success. But then it may be ask'd, if <HI>Eury∣clea</HI>
was a person of such wisdom and fidelity, why does not <HI>U∣lysses</HI>
trust her with the secret of his return? The reason is plain,
it would not only have been contrary to his cautious nature, but
a breach of all decency to trust himself to <HI>Euryclea,</HI> and not to
<HI>Penelope;</HI> this would in some measure have raised the character
of the servant, above that of his wife and Queen. Part of this

<P>VERSE 423. <HI>She veils the torrent of her tearful eyes.] Dacier</HI>
observes that <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his third book of Rhetoric quotes this acti∣on
of <HI>Euryclea</HI> as an instance of a <HI>Paralogism</HI> familiar to <HI>Homer;</HI> and
again in his Poetics, he cites it to the same purpose: A Paralogism
consists in making use of false reasoning, and drawing a false con∣sequence
from true premisses: “All men, says <HI>Aristotle,</HI> are na∣turally
persuaded that where such a thing is, or is done, such
another must happen, we may therefore make them easily be∣lieve
that if the last is, the first must consequently be; but in
reality, the latter which we lay down as truth being often false,
the former is so more frequently, for it does not follow, that
because one thing is, another must necessarily be, but because
we are persuaded of the truth of the latter, we conclude falsely, that
the former is also true.” The Reader will enter into the mean∣ing
of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> and understand what a Paralogism is, by an ex∣ample
<PB N="308" REF="298"/>
of it; for instance, if we were to prove a man to be in
love, we bring it as an argument that he is pale: now this is
a false reasoning or Paralogism, because a person may be pale from
other reasons than love. Thus in the instance of <HI>Euryclea,</HI> “<HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
(says <HI>Aristotle</HI>) imposes upon his Reader, by mentioning
a sign that is known, to draw a consequence from it, to prove
a thing that is not known;” that is, <HI>Homer</HI> endeavours to prove
that the whole story concerning <HI>Euryclea</HI> is true, and that she
really hid her eyes when she wept, because this is a consequence
of passion, and because it is natural for persons to conceal their
eyes with their hands while they weep. This also is a Paralogism,
for every syllable concerning <HI>Euryclea</HI> may be a fiction of the
Poet, tho' such a gesture is natural to a person in her circum∣stances;
the imposition consists in this, namely, in the art of the
Poet in endeavouring to deceive us into a belief, that because
persons when they weep conceal their eyes, therefore it is true
that <HI>Euryclea</HI> thus actually wept; the latter may be evidently, tho'
the former be true: <HI>Aristotle</HI> brings this practice of <HI>Homer</HI> as an
example to all Poets how to tell lies as they ought, or agreeably.</P>

This story concerning the wound of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> may, I fear, in some
parts of it, seem somewhat tedious; it may therefore be necessary
to shew that it is introduced with judgment; and tho' not entire∣ly
entertaining, yet artful.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> in the eighth <HI>Chap.</HI> of his <HI>Poetics,</HI> speaking of the unity
of the action of the <HI>Odyssey,</HI> mentions this wound of <HI>Ulysses.
Homer,</HI> says he, who excell'd other Poets in all respects, seems per∣fectly
to have known this defect, (<HI>viz.</HI> that all the actions of an
Heroe do not constitute the unity of the action, but only such
as are capable to be united with the fable) for in composing his
<HI>Odyssey,</HI> he has not mention'd all the adventures of <HI>Ulysses:</HI> For
example, he has not joined the wound he receiv'd upon <HI>Par∣nassus</HI>
with the account of his feigned madness, when the <HI>Greeks</HI>
assembled their army; for because one of them happen'd, it was
neither necessary nor probable that the other should also happen;
but he has inserted all that could have respect to one and the
same action. Monsieur <HI>Dacier</HI> fully explains <HI>Aristotle;</HI> We have
in this precept (observes that Author) two remarkable events in
the life of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> his feign'd madness, and his wound receiv'd up∣on
<HI>Parnassus:</HI> The Poet mentions the wound, but is silent about
his madness: He saw that the latter had no connexion either in
truth or probability with the subject of his Poem, and therefore
he says not a word of it: he has acted otherwise with respect to
the wound receiv'd upon <HI>Parnassus;</HI> for altho' that wound was
no more to the matter of his Poem, than the madness, yet he
speaks of it, because he found an opportunity of inserting it
<PB N="311" REF="301"/>
so naturally into his principal action, that it becomes a necessary
part of it, since it causes a remembrance of his Heroe, that is,
since it is the occasion of <HI>Euryclea</HI>'s discovering <HI>Ulysses;</HI> so that
this History which is here related at length is no foreign Episode,
but a natural part of the subject, by being thus artfully united to it.
This fully teaches us of what nature the different parts which a
Poet uses to form one and the same action ought to be; name∣ly,
either necessary or probable consequences of one another, as
the remembrance of <HI>Ulysses</HI> was of this wound: every adventure
then that has not this connexion ought to be rejected as foreign,
and as breaking the unity of the action: And therefore <HI>Homer</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook care not to interrupt the unity of his <HI>Odyssey,</HI> by the Epi∣sode
of the feign'd madness of <HI>Ulysses;</HI> for that incident could
not be produced by any that were necessary or proper to the
Poem, nor produce any that had the least relation to it.</P>
<P><HI>Bossu</HI> fully agrees with <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Dacier,</HI> and gathers from
this Episode that some incidents which make not directly any
part of the action or the fable may be inserted into a Poem,
if those incidents are necessary to clear up any part of the fable
or action.</P>
<P>This <HI>remembrance,</HI> or discovery by the wound, is mention'd in
another place; see the twenty-first <HI>Odyssey. Aristotle</HI> in his seven∣teenth
<HI>Chap.</HI> of the <HI>Poetics</HI> prefers this remembrance to that there
made to <HI>Eumaeus;</HI> It is (observes that Author) here manag'd with
more address and art; it is done without design, and seems a
consequence of the story: There <HI>Ulysses</HI> himself discovers the
wound; here it arises from the subject, and a series of incidents:
there <HI>Ulysses</HI> has recourse to it, and it causes no surprize, because
there is no great art in shewing a mark, which we are willing
to have known. All remembrances therefore (says <HI>Aristotle</HI>) which
produce their effects by design have little ingenuity: Whereas
those which are brought about by chance, surprize us, and are
instances of the Poet's art and address.</P>

which literally run thus, “he surpass'd all men in swearing and
stealing:” a terrible character if it were to be understood
according to the letter: It has been imagin'd, that <HI>Homer</HI> com∣mends
<HI>Autolycus</HI> for his address in robbery, and making equivo∣cal
oaths; like the person (says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) who made a truce
with his enemies for several days, and immediately went and ra∣vag'd
their territories by night, and defended it, by telling them
that the truce was not made for the night but the day: or like
the person mention'd by <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> who stole a fish, and gave it
to his neighbour, and being question'd about it swore, that he
had it not himself, nor saw any other person steal it: but this is
not the meaning of <HI>Homer,</HI> for he calls <HI>Autolycus</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or a
<HI>good man,</HI> and adds that this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, was the gift
of a God. The truth is, the former word does not here signifie theft,
nor the latter perjury: the former signifies a laudable address in
concealing our own designs, and discovering those of our ene∣mies;
it consists in surprizing them, when they least expect us,
in beating up their quarters, carrying off their convoys, their
provisions, and in short in all manner of stratagems, authoriz'd
by the laws of war: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies fidelity in observing an
oath, and never violating the sanctity of it. <HI>Plato</HI> in his first book
<HI>de Repub.</HI> makes it plain, that this is the sense of <HI>Homer:</HI> He
there quotes this passage, and asserts that he is the best guardian

<PB N="313" REF="303"/>

by which we serve our friends, and bring detriment to
our enemies; but the answer there given to this assertion is, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
or, by no means: It must be understood with some re∣striction:
It is lawful to deceive an enemy in war, but in com∣mon
life criminal. The qualities therefore that <HI>Homer</HI> commends
in <HI>Autolycus,</HI> are his dexterity in discovering, penetrating and
preventing the designs of his enemies, and the religious obser∣vance
of his oaths, and not theft and perjury; <HI>Eustathius</HI> explains

<P><Q><L>VERSE 526. Then chaunting mystic lays, the closing wound</L>
<L>Of sacred melody confess'd the force.]</L></Q>
This is a remarkable instance of the antiquity of that idle supersti∣tion
of curing wounds by incantation or charms: yet <HI>Homer</HI> is
no way blameable for mentioning it; he wrote according to the
opinion of the age, which whether true or false vindicates him
as a Poet. Indeed almost all other Poets have spoken more bold∣ly
than <HI>Homer</HI> of the power of incantations; thus <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<Q><L>Carmina vel coelo possunt deducere lunam,</L>
<L>Carminibus Circè socios mutavit Ulyssei,</L>
<L>Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpitur anguis.</L></Q>
But we may defend <HI>Homer</HI> from <HI>Pliny,</HI> who has thought this
point, <HI>viz.</HI> whether charms are available physically, worthy of a
serious discussion; he refers to this passage in his natural History,
<HI>lib.</HI> 28. <HI>cap.</HI> 1. <HI>Dixit Homerus profluvium sanguinis vulnerato fe∣mine
Ulyxem inhibuisse carmine, Theophrastus, Ischiadicos sanari, Cato
prodidit Luxatis membris carmen auxiliary, Varro Podagris. Attalus</HI>
affirms, that if a man chance to spy a scorpion, and pronounce
the word <HI>duo,</HI> it will lie still, and never shoot his sting. I think
<PB N="315" REF="305"/>
these grave Authors outdo even the fictions of Poets; and I hard∣ly
believe that any of them would have ventur'd to provoke a
serpent, trusting to the charm. But we are to understand this
charm not merely as a form of words, but as joyn'd with musical
notes, and then it may appear more rational: for the cure of
the Sciatica, <HI>Theophrastus</HI> commends the <HI>Phrygian</HI> music, and <HI>A.
Gellius</HI> for giving ease to it; but adds, <HI>ut Memoriae proditum est.
Apollonius</HI> in his book <HI>de Miris,</HI> affirms from <HI>Theophrastus,</HI> that
Music cures many diseases both of mind and body, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
And the
same Author affirms, that many in his time, especially the <HI>The∣bans,</HI>
used the pipe for the cure of several sicknesses, which <HI>Galen</HI>
calls <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>super loco affecto tibiâ canere;</HI> or <HI>loca
dolentia decantare.</HI> I will not affirm that such charms of music
have no power in some maladies; every one knows what an ef∣fect
the harp of <HI>David</HI> had over the spirits of <HI>Saul;</HI> but we have
either lost, or not yet found out the art: A natural reason may
be assign'd for it, for as the musical notes move the air, so the
air moves the inward spirits, and they the humours of the body,
which are the seat of diseases; so that by this new motion they
may be condensed, ratified, dissipated or expelled, according as
they are agitated or influenced by the concussion of the musical
notes; but however this be, if other Poets may say that charms
have power to stop rivers in their courses, <HI>Homer</HI> is not to be
condemn'd for ascribing the power of stopping blood to incan∣tations.

<P>VERSE 544.—<HI>abrupt—my son!—my King!—she cry'd.</HI>]
It may seem incredible that this dialogue between <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Eu∣ryclea</HI>
could be held in the presence of <HI>Penelope,</HI> and she not hear
it: How is this to be reconcil'd to probability? I will answer in
the words of <HI>Eustathius:</HI> The Poet, says he, has admirably guar∣ded
against this objection; it is for this reason that he mentions
<PB N="316" REF="306"/>
the falling of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s leg into the water, the sound of the vessel
from that accident, the overturning of it, and the effusion of the
water: all these different sounds may easily be suppos'd to drown
the voice of <HI>Euryclea,</HI> so as it might not be heard by <HI>Penelope;</HI> it
is true, she could not but observe this confusion that happen'd
while <HI>Euryclea</HI> washes; but the age of <HI>Euryclea</HI> might naturally
make her believe that all this happen'd by accident thro' her fee∣bleness,
and <HI>Penelope</HI> might be persuaded that it was thus occasi∣oned,
having no reason to suspect the truth: besides, what is
more frequent on the Theatre than to speak to the audience,
while the persons on the stage are suppos'd not to hear? In re∣ality,
it is evident that <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Euryclea</HI> were at a proper di∣stance
from <HI>Penelope,</HI> probably out of decency while the feet
were washing; for as soon as that office is over, <HI>Homer</HI> tells us
that <HI>Ulysses</HI> drew nearer to the fire where <HI>Penelope</HI> sate, that he
might resume the conference.</P>

his very companions, who attended him in his voyages, possess'd
this virtue in so eminent a degree as to suffer themselves to be

the sorrow of <HI>Penelope,</HI> but the nature of it: It is not so
much intended to illustrate her grief, as her various agitations
and different thoughts compar'd to the different accents in the
mournful song of the nightingale; for thus <HI>Homer</HI> applies it.</P>
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</Q>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> adds, that <HI>Homer</HI> relates this story very differently from
later Authors: He mentions nothing of <HI>Progne, Tereus,</HI> or <HI>Pan∣dion,</HI>
unless that name be the same with <HI>Pandareus; Itylus</HI> like∣wise
is by them call'd <HI>Itys.</HI> The story is thus, according to
these writers: <HI>Philomela</HI> was the wife of <HI>Tereus</HI> King of <HI>Thrace,</HI>
she had a sister nam'd <HI>Progne,</HI> whom <HI>Tereus</HI> ravish'd and cut her
tongue out, that she might not discover the crime to <HI>Philomela;</HI>
but <HI>Progne</HI> betray'd it by weaving the story in a piece of embroi∣dery;
upon this <HI>Philomela</HI> slew her own son <HI>Itys</HI> or <HI>Itylus,</HI> and
serv'd up his flesh to the table of her husband <HI>Tereus;</HI> which be∣ing
made known to him he pursues <HI>Philomela</HI> and <HI>Prognè,</HI> who
are feign'd to be chang'd into birds for their swift flight into <HI>A∣thens,</HI>
by which they escap'd the revenge of <HI>Tereus. Philomela</HI> is
fabled to be turn'd into a nightingale, and <HI>Progne</HI> into a swallow;
it being observ'd by <HI>Pausanias,</HI> that no swallow ever builds in
<HI>Thrace,</HI> or nightingale is ever seen there, as hating the country of
<HI>Tereus.</HI> But <HI>Homer</HI> follows a different history: <HI>Pandareus</HI> son of
<HI>Merops</HI> had three daughters, <HI>Meropè, Cleothera,</HI> and <HI>Aëdon: Pan∣dareus</HI>
<PB N="318" REF="308"/>
married his eldest daughter <HI>Aëdon</HI> to <HI>Zethus</HI> brother of
<HI>Amphion,</HI> mention'd in the eleventh <HI>Odyssey;</HI> she had an only son
nam'd <HI>Itylus;</HI> and being envious at the numerous family of her
brother-in-law <HI>Amphion,</HI> she resolves to murther <HI>Amaleus</HI> the eld∣est
of her nephews; her own son <HI>Itylus</HI> was brought up with
the children of <HI>Amphion,</HI> and lay in the same bed with this <HI>Ama∣leus.
Aëdon</HI> directs her son <HI>Itylus</HI> to absent himself one night
from the bed, but he forgets her orders; at the time determin'd,
she conveys herself into the apartment, and murthers her own
son <HI>Itylus,</HI> by mistake, instead of her nephew <HI>Amaleus:</HI> upon this,
almost in distraction, she begs the Gods to remove her from the
race of humankind, they grant her prayer, and change her into

<P>VERSE 647. <HI>Immur'd within the silent bow'r of sleep,</HI> &amp;c.]
This seems to be a bold fiction, and Commentators have labour'd
hard to shew the reason of it: Some imagine, that by the horn
is meant a tunic of the eye, which is call'd horny; and that the
ivory represents the teeth; and that by these allusions the Poet in∣tended
to express that what we hear spoken may be false, but
what we see must infallibly be true: that is, according to this
fable, the ivory gate emits falshood, that of horn, truth. Others
explain <HI>Homer</HI> by referring to the nature of horn and ivory, horn be∣ing
pervious to the sight, and ivory impenetrable. <HI>Dacier,</HI> from
<HI>Eustathius,</HI> gives us a very different solution; by horn which is
transparent, <HI>Homer</HI> means the air, or heavens which are translu∣cent;
by ivory, he denotes the earth which is gross and opake:
Thus the dreams which come from the earth, that is, thro' the
gate of ivory, are false; those from heaven, or thro' the gate of
horn, true. But it may be thought that there are no grounds,
from the words of <HI>Homer,</HI> for such an interpretation. I ima∣gine
that this fable is built upon a real foundation, and that there
were places called the gates of falshood and truth: <HI>Diodorus Sicu∣lus</HI>
in his second book describing the ceremonies concerning the
<PB N="319" REF="309"/>
dead, mentions the gates of oblivion, of hatred and lamentati∣on;
and then adds, that there are other gates in the same place;
namely, in <HI>Memphis</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> that are called the gates of veri∣ty,
near which there is a statue of justice without an head; now
<HI>Homer</HI> in the twenty-fourth <HI>Odyssey</HI> places the region of dreams
in the way to the infernal shades, and it is past dispute that he bor∣rows
all these fables of <HI>Styx, Cocytus,</HI> (that is, of the gates of
hatred, lamentation,) <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and places them in hell,
after <HI>Orpheus,</HI> who adapted all his ceremonies according to the
rites of burial observ'd at <HI>Memphis,</HI> as <HI>Diodorus</HI> fully proves; if
therefore he borrows the fable of the gates of oblivion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from
<HI>Aegypt,</HI> why may he not the story of the gates of falshood and veri∣ty?
especially since he takes his whole relation concerning hell from
the customs of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and this region of dreams is pla∣ced
by him in the passage to hell: It may therefore not be im∣possible
but this story of the gates of sleep, may have a real
foundation, and be built upon the customs of the <HI>Aegyptians.</HI></P>
