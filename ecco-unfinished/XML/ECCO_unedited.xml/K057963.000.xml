<HEAD>THE RETORT COURTEOUS; OR CANDID APPEAL to the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>ON a supposition (I may venture to say a certainty) that the Proprietors of Drury-lane Theatre have not us'd me with that candour, which is unquestionably due to an Author, who many years ago contributed his MITE to the entertainment of the Town, I am in∣due'd to publish the following letters, by way of APPEAL to the Frequenters of the Theatres.</P>
<P>Some of my friends had repeatedly soli∣cited me to offer my tragedy of Dido to the Proprietors of Drury-lane House, as the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>part of the Heroine could be so admirably play'd by Mrs. SIDDONS: They at last, as <HI>Polonius</HI> says,
<Q><L>—"by laboursome petition</L>
<L>"Wrung from me my slow leave."</L></Q>I accordingly sent, above two years ago, the tragedy and a comedy to THOMAS I INLEY, Esquire, the Manager, and with them the following letter.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have taken the liberty of sending a tragedy and a comedy, both of which I flatter myself would make a respectable appearance on your stage. As to the tragedy there can be no doubt of its success; since it was received with applause above seventeen years ago, tho' it was got up in a very slovenly manner, and the Heroine play'd by a Lady, who was never very great in characters <HI>truly-pathetic</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This elegant Actress fell short of her usual excellence in tragic characters of the SOFTER call.</NOTE> I withdrew the piece on account of an unhap∣py quarrel with Mr. GARRICK, or it would probably, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er now, have afforded your cele∣brated Actress a farther opportunity of dis∣playing her great talents.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>As the Comedy has never appear'd its suc∣cess cannot be ascertain'd. However, from the (perhaps) flattering applause, bestow'd upon it by some acknowledg'd judges. I have no reason to doubt of its favourable reception, since the <HI>business</HI> of the piece, with less hu∣mour and character than it possesses, would secure its success—add to this, that it can be capitally play'd at your theatre.</P>
<P>I have by me several Dramas of the tragic and comic cas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, all of which have had such sanction, as makes me believe that none of them would do you stage the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> discredit.</P>
<P>When you have perused the Pieces, I should be proud of an interview; as, I think, it would be for the interest of your theatre to encourage an Author, whose situation is independent, and to whom stage-emoluments are only a secon∣dary consideration.</P>
<P>I shall, with pleasure, wait on you, when∣ever you shall favour me with a line to that purpose.</P>

<P>From the <HI>sudden</HI> return of the two pieces, I suspected that they had been sent back to me <HI>unread;</HI> as I had been previously informed that every manuscript play, offered to that theatre, was perused by <HI>each</HI> of the Proprietors, be∣fore it was accepted or rejected: in conse∣quence of which I wrote to ALL the Proprie∣tors as follows.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have received a billet, signed T. Westley, wherein the writer informs me he is directed
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>to acquaint me, the Proprietors of Drury-lane theatre are of opinion, that my two pieces cannot be produced with advantage to the theatre—I wish that one of you had favoured me with a line on the occasion; Mr. Westley would not then have been <HI>privy</HI> to your re∣fusal of the pieces, which may possibly be a means of their being rejected <HI>elsewhere.</HI> It is no new thing for a Manager, even without fair examination, to refuse a piece, that has been refused at a rival theatre. If any of you by letter, had offered a daughter as a bride, what would he think of that Gentleman, who, instead of a <HI>private</HI> answer, should send a <HI>ser∣vant</HI> to report his refusal?</P>
<P>Had your censure fallen singly on the Co∣medy, I might <HI>perhaps</HI> have thought it just; but, as poor Dido is involved in your anathe∣ma, I cannot help thinking my two dramatic Children are thus cruelly treated, on account of their literary Father. It was many years ago too-truly prophecied, that my quarrel with Mr. GARRICK would be an almost-insu∣perable obstacle to my success on the stage. However, as I can incontes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibly prove <HI>that</HI> gentleman used me most illiberally, it is ra∣ther hard that my dramatic Character should
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>suffer, thro' my lenity of not laying before the public his unjustifiable treatment.</P>
<P>It appears to me very unaccountable that a tragedy, which Mr. GARRICK'S <HI>secret in∣fluence was not able to damn,</HI> should be rejected, because it was withdrawn by the author, on <HI>promise</HI> that it should re-appear, when it could be exhibited agreeably to his wish.—The sto∣ry is concisely as follows.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick, for reasons too tedious to be told, objected to Dido; and, by his authority, kept it off the stage from the year 1761 to 1767. Even then he would not agree to its representation, but on the <HI>hard</HI> condition of bringing it out for Mr. <HI>Holland's</HI> benefit; hoping its first appearance as a <HI>benefit-play</HI> would effectually cripple it. I should never have consented to Dido's appearance in such <HI>disgraceful</HI> manner, if Mr. Garrick had not assured me, that a sufficient number of nights should be left open for its Run, and at the same time insinuated that another play, on the same subject, had been put into his hands, the success of which the author was willing to try at a benefit.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<P>While the play was in rehearsal, he saw to his <HI>great mortification</HI> that it <HI>would</HI> succeed, and on the day, preceding its first representa∣tion, he hurried off to Bath, having either written, or permitted to appear in the Public Advertiser (the then theatrical Gazette) a most scandalous copy of doggerel verses against the tragedy, and without having fixed the se∣cond night of its exhibition. Its first appear∣ance was on Saturday, and the only night, in the succeeding week unengaged for a benefit, was Thursday. After the play had met with such applause, I desired it might be given out for Thursday, to which Mr. <HI>George Garrick,</HI> the Deputy-manager, tenaciously objected; alledging he expected a COMMAND for that evening, and that he must hear from his Bro∣ther before he fixed the second night. He was, however, over-ruled by Mr. LACY. and the piece was play'd a second time. All the ensuing week was appointed for benefits, ex∣cept Thursday, and that evening the <HI>Earl of Warwick</HI> was to be play'd at the desire of the honourable CHARLES TOWNSEND, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer. On application to that Gentleman, he politely relinquished the requested play; but Mrs. YATES's illness prevented the exhibition of my piece. The
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>third night therefore could not be fixed till that day month, on account of Passion-week, and the intervening benefits.</P>
<P>After the second night applications were made to me for the purchase of the copy. I wrote to Mr. Garrick then at Bath. He sent me a seemingly-sincere letter, congratulated me on the success of the play, and dissuaded me from publication. He arrived in town before the third representation, and, though the part of Dido was obliged to be play'd by Mrs. William Barry, a second-rate actress, on account of Mrs. Yates's illness, the piece was re∣ceived with great applause. We then mutually agreed to postpone the farther representation (it being so late as the 14th of May) till the ensuing season, Mr. Garrick promising to get up the piece with all possible advantages; but a revolution happening from the purchase of Covent-Garden Theatre, Dido was deprived of Mr. <HI>Powel</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Yates.</HI></P>
<P>In October<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">November.</NOTE> following Mr. Garrick, with∣out ever consulting me, allotted the parts of Aeneas and Dido to Reddish and Mrs. <HI>William Barry.</HI> I objected, as Mr. BARRY and Mrs. DANCER were then engaged at Drury-lane.
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>Mr. Garrick, after some warm expressions, at length consented that the two parts should be given to Mr. Barry and Mrs. Dancer, and that the play should be brought out after Christ∣mas. Mr. Barry's affairs in Ireland were in so critical a situation, that he was obliged on a sew hours' notice to set out for Dublin. In his absence the part of Dido was given to Mrs. Dancer, who expressed a great liking to it. Mr. Barry, on his return, was applied to about studying Aeneas. He promised to do it, if I would put off the play to another season, alledging he had no leisure for study till the theatrical vacation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He afterwards studied a new part in <HI>Zenobia</HI> that season.</NOTE>. I would not consent, and desired a positive answer. He then told me he had neither read the part nor the play. I gave him a copy of the tragedy, and a meeting between us was appointed in his dressing-room the next time he played. We met accordingly. After many hesitations, shufflings, and ridiculous objections he de∣clined the part. His objections were easily refuted, and so confused was his behaviour, that I must have been blind, not to have seen he was influenced by Mr. Garrick. I then asked him if he had any objection to Mrs.
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>Dancer's playing Dido. He assured me she would never play the character, unless he was in the piece. The play was therefore with∣drawn on Mr. Garrick's <HI>promise</HI> that it should re-appear, whenever I should think it could be satisfactorily performed.</P>
<P>I was so highly irritated at Mr. Garrick's duplicity, that I wrote a narrative of our quar∣rel from its first rise, which happened in De∣cember 1759, on account of the REGISTER-OFFICE; containing all the Letters and Oc∣currences that passed between us. I should have published it, had I not been pressingly dissuaded by my friend Mr. Holland, who was at that time in expectation of purchasing a share in the theatre. I now repent that I suffered my self to be dissuaded, as the narrative would have excited the curiosity and atten∣tion of the literary world, and have convin∣ced the public of the illiberal usage, I met with from that great Actor and Manager. It may not yet be too late; for if Dido must be denied an appearance on the stage, its injured Author has surely a right to vindicate his dra∣matic character by Publication.</P>
<P>From the above true slate of the case, I would ask if a play, that succeeded against all
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>the uncandid practices of a great Manager—a play, that was got up in a careless and sloven∣ly manner—a play, that was exhibited with∣out a single new dress or seene—a play, that was keptlingering near <HI>seven</HI> weeks from its first to its third representation, and abused in the Manager's Paper <HI>before</HI> it made its appear∣ance on the stage—I say, Gentlemen, I would ask, if it can be fairly supposed that a play, which succeeded under all these disadvanta∣ges, could fail of success, when properly ex∣hibited?</P>
<P>Suffer me, Gentlemen, to relate one in∣stance of prepossession against Dido. The ce∣lebrated author of <HI>Tristram Shandy</HI> was at its first representation, and, when the cur∣tain dropp'd, being ask'd his opinion of the piece, replied in his humourous way, <Q>I “”look upon it as a theatrical Take-in.</Q> The Gentleman, who ask'd the question, answer'd, <Q>“I'm surpriz'd to hear this! you seem'd plea∣sed ”with the representation</Q>—<Q>And was “”truly so,</Q> return'd the Wit: <Q>I only ex∣pected “to see a <HI>mere benefit-play,</HI> and it has turned out one of the best new tragedies I ”ever saw.</Q></P>
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<P>You think, Gentlemen, that Dido cannot be produc'd with advantage to your theatre. Far be it from me to wish you should be losers by any performance of mine. I think there is a moral certainty, that Dido will have a Run of nine nights. If, therefore, you will produce the receipts of the managers' six nights, for any new tragedy you have exhi∣bited, since the commencement of your thea∣trical reign, I don't desire to pocket a shilling, till such sum has been received, though you should agree to get up the piece even in this parliamentary vacation. As parliament does not meet till late in January, depend on't, Gentlemen, you will have great need of no∣velty, much novelty, to bring good houses.</P>
<P>To guard you from every risk, I beg leave to propose a new plan. If you will fix a fair price for the use of your theatre nine nights in November, I should be glad to con∣tract with you. Nay. Gentlemen, I will even extend the number of nights to eighteen, and play Dido and a Comedy alternately. I have other comedies besides that you have seen. I will lodge in your hands Govern∣ment-Securities
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>to the amount of the stipu∣lated sum.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The Letter, sent to you from Drury-lane Theatre in the names of the Proprietors, was an official one, agreeable to a rule of that house, when any pieces, presented there for perfor∣mance, are returned. Mr. Westley is a person they confide in, and you may rely upon his secrecy respecting the business in ques∣tion.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
<P>As I found nothing could be done with Mr. Linley, I wrote as follows to ALBANY WAL∣LIS, Esquire, one of Mr. Garrick's Executors, on a supposition that he would shew my letter to the Proprietors.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Last night I resolved to write to my friend, Mr. J—H—, who has been long ac∣quainted with you, to accompany me to your house, as I have a matter of some consequence to impart to you: however, on farther rumi∣nation, it appeared to me more adviseable to open the business by letter, as the affair might, by that means, be kept the more secret.—But to the purpose.</P>
<P>On the 23d day of September, I sent to Mr. Linley a tragedy and a comedy, which were returned by Mr. Westley, the treasurer of Drury-lane theatre, with a short billet, in∣forming me the Proprietors were of opinion, that my pieces could not be produc'd with advantage to the theatre.—As Mr. Westley's letter was dated on the 25th of September, I think it was hardly possible that both pieces could be read (at least be duly and deliberately
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>read) by <HI>all</HI> the Proprietors. In short, I can∣not help thinking, that both the pieces were so <HI>hastily</HI> rejected, because they have the mis∣fortune to be <HI>mine.</HI>—I impute their rejection <HI>solely</HI> to an unhappy quarrel, which subsisted between the celebrated Roscius and me.—Nay. I am almost of opinion they were re∣turn'd to me <HI>unread.</HI></P>
<P>As to the comedy, I can only say, it has had the sanction of some acknowledged judges of the drama; and, were it not my own, I would not scruple to assert, it has equal, if not superior merit to any of the comic pieces produc'd at Drury-lane, since the commencement of their proprietorship; Mr. Sheridan's excepted.</P>
<P>As to the tragedy, viz. Dido, I may, with∣out the least imputation of vanity, stand up in its defence, because it has had the sanction of the Public. It was exhibited three nights above seventeen years ago, and received with applause, in spite of—I am sorry to add—<HI>Mr. Garrick's secret influence to cripple it.</HI> From your intimacy with that inimitable Actor, I must suppose you can∣not be a stranger to the cause of my withdraw∣ing Dido the ensuing winter.—Mr. Garrick's
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>behaviour was such, that I wrote a pamphlet, with the following title and motto: THEATRICAL DUPLICITY: OR A GENUINE NARRATIVE OF THE CONDUCT of DAVID GARRICK, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR> TO JOSEPH REED on his Tragedy of DIDO: CONTAINING All the Letters, and several Conversations, which pass'd between the Manager, Author, and Others. on that Subject.</P>

<L>Nothing extenuate,</L>
<L>Nor set down aught in <HI>malice.</HI></L>

<Q><L>Foul deeds will rise,</L>
<L>Tho' all the earth o'erwhelm them.</L>
<BIBL>HAMLET.</BIBL></Q>
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
<P>I read a great part of the narrative to Mr. Holland, who, in a very pressing manner, dis∣suaded me from publishing it. I now repent that I did not publish it at that time, at least not during Mr. Garrick's life, as I am sully per∣suaded my dramatic character hath greatly suffer'd, thro' my omission of laying before the world, a series of facts, which bear hard on Mr. Garrick's memory as a Manager. and which not a little affect it as a Man.</P>
<P>On the 30th of September I wrote to the Proprietors, and went to the Trea∣surer's office after the play, in expecta∣tion of seeing Mr. Westley, whose absence induced me to leave the letter with a young man, desiring him to give it to the Treasurer; with a charge to deliver it in the presence of <HI>all,</HI> at least a majority of the Proprietors. In my letter I dropp'd all defence of the come∣dy, but defended Dido in such a manner, as must have procur'd its exhibition, had not there been a strong prepossession against the play in the case. I made the Proprietors two offers; the first, to allow them to re∣cieve (before I pocketed one shilling) a sum equal to the amount of the Managers' six nights of any new tragedy they had produc'd;
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>the second, to hire, at a fair price, their theatre nine nights, for the exhibition of Dido; or eighteen, to play the tragedy, and a comedy alternately; with a proposal of lodging in their hands Government Securities to the amount of the stipulated sum—Both these offers they have rejected.</P>
<P>I am therefore under the disagreeable ne∣cessity of publishing the Narrative, to con∣vince the literary world, that I am not desti∣tute of abilities to contribute to the entertain∣ment of the Public.</P>
<P>You may possibly think that I have <HI>not</HI> written the pamphlet alluded to, and that I have only made mention of it <HI>in terrorem.</HI> If such your opinion, I will, whenever desir'd, read the Narrative to you, or to any person you shall appoint. I am sorry that no other alternative remains; but as I have dramatic pieces by me, which, if play'd with tolerable success, will bring me three thousand pounds, or upwards, my duty, as a father of three chil∣dren, (tho' I am in a state of independency) certainly obliges me to make use of such ex∣pedient.—When I publish the Narrative, I intend to publish Dido. I am not without
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>hopes of having permission to dedicate the tragedy to a Great Personage.</P>
<P>You may also think, that my publication of the Narrative will fail of credit, as Mr. Garrick is no more.—Don't deceive your∣self in that particular. His very letters (had I not living witnesses of his duplicity) would corroborate the facts, I have stated therein. I believe my friend H—will assure you, that my veracity is not to be question'd. How∣ever, to remove every doubt, I shall prefix to the Narrative an affidavit of the truth of its contents: Nay, probably, my late letter to the Proprietors of Drury-lane Theatre.</P>
<P>You may farther think, that an attack on so great a character as Mr. Garrick may make me many literary enemies.—Even in that case, how shall I be a loser? Mr. Garrick's con∣duct hath blasted my reputation, as a dramatic writer, and the far greater part of my pro∣ductions is dramatic. If, therefore, I have nothing to <HI>hope</HI> from the stage, I have surely nothing to <HI>fear</HI> from the partisans of Mr. Garrick.</P>
<P>If you are unacquainted with Mr. Garrick's disingenuous conduct, respecting Dido, I
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>could wish you would desire the Proprietors to shew you my letter, as it contains a concise account of his duplicity.—I ob∣serve from a recent advertisement,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the sale of Renter's Shares.</NOTE> that an intimacy exists between you.</P>
<P>You have been characteriz'd to me a sensi∣ble, and (what is still more to your credit) an honest man: And as you have been the tem∣porary guardian of Mr. Garrick's proper∣ty, you may prove a guardian to his charac∣ter. by preventing an injured Author's ap∣peal to the public; an appeal absolutely ne∣cessary to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ore his literary reputation, which is almost annihilated by Mr. Gar∣rick's disingenuous conduct.</P>
<P>You may ask <Q>How can I serve you in this “”affair?</Q>—The question answers itself.</P>

<P>I am extremely oblig'd to you, for procu∣ring a promise of a second perusal of Dido, but if the piece is to be submitted to the judg∣ment of the person, who has already read it, I must naturally suppose he will abide by his late opinion. A physician, who has declared

<P>As the Gentleman. who read Dido, has not particulariz'd his objections, it is impossible for me to refute them. It cannot be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Dido was received with applause: and, since its exhibition, I can truly assert that the
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>manuscript has been read by, at least, fifty Gentlemen of literary abilities; many of whom have paid me the highest compliments on its imagery, pathos, and simplicity of style. I can, therefore, only assign conjectural reasons for the censure, lately pass'd on the piece. The Gentleman was, probably, a <HI>warm ad∣mirer</HI> of Mr. Garrick: If so, he can hardly be a <HI>friend</HI> to me, on account of my (sup∣pos'd-blameable) conduct to that inimitable Actor. He may also be one of the many critics, who prefer a florid high-sounding style to a simple one. Dido will, therefore, hardly suit his critical taste. I hope I may be allow'd to assert, in defence of my tragedy, that Isa∣bella, Oroonoko, Jane Shore, and Venice Preserv'd owe their greatest success to simpli∣ty of diction.—Every tragic Author, who hopes to <HI>reach the heart,</HI> should have in view, that admirable precept of <HI>Horace,</HI></P>

Their characters, as judges of dra∣matic literature, are sufficiently known. I have not the least personal, or epistolary ac∣quaintance with either of them: it cannot therefore be suppos'd, they meant to flatter me by such extract. I should not have been able to produce it, if it had not yesterday been given me by a Gentleman, who visited me, on a report that Dido had been refus'd by the Drury-lane Managers. The extract runs thus: viz.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your letter, tho' dated on Saturday, did not reach me till Tuesday night. To be kept in suspense, till Mr. <HI>Sheridan's</HI> return to town, is a distressing circumstance. That Gentleman, if he would have taken the trouble of perusing Dido, might have put an end to the dispute. His judgment in dramatic composition is unquestionable. Tho' he has in his <HI>Critic</HI> so wittily ridicul'd tragedy, I am convinc'd, from his fine feelings, that he would not even wish to banish it from the stage. His omission of naming a person to peruse Dido, before he went into the coun∣try, has not a favourable appearance; as he can be no stranger to the anxiety, which must necessarily attend an Author, while he conti∣nues in a state of suspense.</P>
<P>From the decisive opinion, which the inge∣nious compilers of Biographia Dramatica have given of Dido. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would scarce appeal unna∣tural in me, to suppose the Proprietors have
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>rejected the tragedy, more on account of <HI>private</HI> dislike to the Author, than from a <HI>real</HI> dislike of the piece.</P>
<P>As I made no secret of declaring to many of my friends in the summer, that I should offer Dido to the proprietors of Drury-lane theatre this season, I am daily teiz'd with the disagreeable salutation, <Q>Can it be true that “”the Managers have rejected Dido?</Q>—The matter is therefore come to a crisis—The tragedy must either be play'd or publish'd this season, or my dramatic character (respecting the many pieces I have by me) is entirely blasted.</P>
<P>I told you I had some expectations of get∣ting my Narrative and Tragedy introduc'd to a GREAT PERSONAGE, and at the same time inform'd you of the means to effect it. A shorter (tho' apparently less-successful) mode has been pointed out to me, which is my send∣ing the tragedy to—<NOTE N="****" PLACE="foot">A COMMONER of great influence.—I am now almost convinc'd, that an application to the right honourable Gentleman would not have suc∣ceded. I have, therefore, suppress'd such part of the letter, as relates to Him, and the means by which I hop'd to interest Him in my favour.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
<P>As I mentioned an Epitaph, (which in all probability you have not read) I hope you will not think me impertinent in request∣ing your acceptance of such literary trifle. It may prove the fugitive entertainment of a few idle minutes, if a Gentleman of your profes∣sional engagements may be suppos'd to have any idle ones.</P>
<P>I have a copy of the tragedy. I therefore wish the piece to remain with you, that it may be ready for a perusal, in case the Proprietors should appoint another person to read it. However, as the season is advancing, I have no time to lose. It would hardly be prudent in me to remain <HI>unresolv'd</HI> and <HI>unprepar'd</HI> till Mr. <HI>Sheridan's</HI> arrival in town, as his stay in the country may be longer than he ex∣pected, and as transcript of the Narrative and Tragedy will take up no little time. The person, conditionally engaged for that purpose, must transcribe it <HI>in my own house.</HI> He can only attend occasionally an hour or two in the evenings: I must therefore reason∣ably suppose, he will not be able to finish the two pieces in less than a month. He shall not, however, make a beginning till Monday sen'night, in which interval, I have some hopes
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>of hearing the Proprietors' resolution, as you have kindly intimated in your letter, that you will speak to them about the tragedy.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude, without returning you my most sincere thanks for your endea∣vours to serve me—I also hope you will generously pardon the trouble, I have given you on this occasion.</P>

<P>Mr. Wallis acquainted me, that he had at∣tempted to procure the reading of the play, and intimated, that, if no better luck should attend him when Mr. <HI>Sheridan</HI> came to town, he should not be able to render me any ser∣vice—About a fortnight aster I wrote to him the following letter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I should have written to you the last week, if I had not determined to take the col∣lective opinions of some friends on this embarassing affair.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
<P>I am advised by all, to whom I opened my case, to commence literary hostilities on the Managers of Drury-lane theatre; but as I would yet willingly make them my friends, (and, if I am not extravagantly flatter'd, it will be their interest to secure my friend∣ship) I shall wait the issue of Mr. <HI>Sheri∣dan's</HI> coming to town.</P>
<P>It seems to some of my friends beyond a doubt, that the Proprietors are determined to clip my dramatic wings, or they would have soften'd their refusal of Dido and the Comedy, by an offer of looking at some other of my pieces. I could, among my other productions, furnish them with a greater va∣riety, than a single five-act piece could af∣ford. I mean a three act comedy and a mock-tragedy, which I was, a sew years age, advised to start against Mr. Sheridan's <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> However, as the Gentlemen seem to treat me so cavalierly, it would, I presume, be in vain to make them such offer.</P>
<P>Some of my friends have intimated, that if the Proprietor, had been willing to serve <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, they would have sent the piece to Mrs SID∣DONS, as a test of its merit, adding, if she should sufficiently sees the part of the heroine,
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>it is impossible the play should fail; especially as it would be so strongly supported by the characters of Aeneas, Narbal, and Achates. One Gentleman severely observed, that the fate of a late comedy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Piece was damn'd.</NOTE> (to mention no other theatrical miscarriages) was a convincing proof of the <HI>insufficiency</HI> of the critical abi∣lities of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>son, appointed for the pe∣rusal of pieces tender'd to Drury-lane thea∣tre. He even offered to wait on Mr. Linley in behalf of my tragedy, but, as I would not wish to give offence to that Gentleman, or his Brother-Proprietors, I declined the offer.</P>
<P>In short, it seems the general opinion of all the Gentlemen whom I have consulted, that the Proprietors. for some <HI>private</HI> rea∣sons, seem, at all events, determin'd on the non-admission of any of my pieces on their stage.</P>
<P>In consequence of my friends' advice, I am therefore determin'd to strain every nerve to have Dido exhibited, tho' I should even sacrifice the whole profits of the piece to ef∣fect it.</P>
<P>If I should be under the disagreeable ne∣cessity of publishing my Narrative, I am
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>advis'd, by way of preparing the Public, to print the letter I sent to the Proprietors. That letter, however, would be imperfect, unless it were followed by those I have written to you, with your answers; and, as your behaviour to me has been so open and liberal, I could not even reconcile to myself the idea of such proceeding, without having pre∣viously obtained your permission to lay them before the Public.</P>
<P>As Dido has been refus'd, I have certainly a right to know what have been the objec∣tions to the piece. Would Mr. Garrick have denied an Author that satisfaction? No: he would (if desir'd) have pointed out his objec∣tions, and endeavoured to have convinc'd him of the improbability of the success of the piece, Why then am I denied such satisfaction? The tragedy, above seventeen years ago, had the sanction of the Public. Is the Public, since that time, grown more sensible and re∣lin'd in tragic taste?—I apprehend not—The town, I may venture to assert, since Mr. Gar∣rick quitted the stage, has patiently suffered some tragedies to pass, which, while he conti∣nued Manager, would scarce <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ave been
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>suffered to have made their theatrical appear∣ance a second time, and which would have been a disgrace to Drury-lane theatre in his reign.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>P.S. I should be obliged to you for a line, when Mr. Sheridan has read, or procur'd a reading of Dido, till when it may remain in your hands.</P>
<P>Here ends the epistolary correspondence; to which I beg leave to add another public testimony of the merits of Dido, given by Mr. Garrick's biographer, Mr. Thomas Davies, whose judgment in dramatic composition was indisputable. In his life of the <HI>British</HI> Ros∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us, which was revis'd (some say partly written) by Dr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> he speaks thus of my tragedy.</P>
<P><Q>“Dido, a tragedy, written by Mr. Reed, a rope maker, was acted for the benefit of Mr. HOLLAND. It was thought an unusual favour, to give the <HI>first</HI> night of a new play to an Actor; nor does the public <HI>know,</HI> why
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>Dido was <HI>not</HI> play'd <HI>more</HI> than three nights. If the Managers pleaded, that the season was too far advanc'd to act it successively, as was usual in other new pieces, it might have been resum'd the next winter; and that it merited such favour, may be pre∣sum'd from the applause bestow'd upon it. The Author is certainly a man of genius—His farce of the Register-Office contains a variety of characters aptly drawn, and it has ”met with great, and deserved applause.</Q></P>
<P>Life of David Garrick, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Vol. 2. p. 120.</P>
<P>Tho' Mr. Davies says, <Q>Nor does the “Public <HI>know</HI> why Dido was <HI>not</HI> play'd ”<HI>more</HI> than three nights,</Q> yet Mr. Davies himself <HI>know</HI> very well why Dido was <HI>not</HI> play'd <HI>more</HI> than three nights.—The reader may naturally exclaim, <Q>Davies was univer∣sally “reputed an hones! man, then why did he leave the Public in the dark in that ”particular.</Q>—Let me offera conjectural ex∣cuse in favour of poor Davies—might he not thus reason with himself?—<Q>I am now “writing in praise of Mr. Garrick, and should I <HI>fairly</HI> acquaint the Public with the true cause of Dido's non-appearance the next
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>winter, I shall fix an indelible stigma on the ”character of my <HI>histrionic</HI> Hero.</Q></P>
<P>If the Register-Office deserve the above character, why have the Managers <HI>suppress'd</HI> its exhibition?—As Hamlet says, <Q>There “is something in this <HI>more than natural,</HI> if ”philosophy could find it out.</Q></P>
<P>To throw some small light on this mystery, I beg leave to inform my readers, that the Register-Office would have been <HI>got up</HI> a sew weeks ago, if its revival had not been un∣expectedly <HI>prohibited</HI> without any reason as∣sign'd. A whisper, circulated behind the Cur∣tain, ascribes the prohibition to Miss POPE'S excellence in the character of Mrs. <HI>Doggerel,</HI> as it might possibly he a means of lessening her theatrical consequence in TILBURIANA. If the revival of the farce has been prevented on such account, I must necessarily esteem the prohibition a very flattering compliment.</P>
<P>The person. who was to have transcribed the Narrative and Tragedy, was detain'd in the country till the middle of December; and three days before his arrival in town the Gentleman, through whose means I hop'd to get the two pieces introduc'd to MAJESTY,
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>had obtain'd <HI>leave of absence.</HI> I therefore dropp'd all thoughts of a fresh application, and determin'd to publish, in case the Manager, on the second reading of Dido, still resus'd its exhibition. On Mr. Sher<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lan's coming to town, I fully expected the promis'd reading would take place; but—I am quite in the dark for what reason such promise remains to this hour <HI>unfulfilled.</HI></P>
<P>From Mr. Linley's postponing the second reading of Dido, may it not be presurn'd that he was <HI>afraid</HI> such reading would turn out in favour of the piece? Has not this breach of promise a strong appearance of resentment. against me? But in what have I offended him? I can safely decline in nothing, unless by calling in question the abilities, or integri∣ty of his Favourite, the <HI>profound</HI> Critic. I am indeed of opinion, that the decline of drama∣tic genius, since Mr. Sheridan quitted the Ma∣nagement, and refus'd the inspection of pie∣ces offer'd to Drury-lane theatre, may be <HI>fairly</HI> ascrib'd to Mr. Linley's want of neces∣sary discernment in dramatic composition; but as I never publish'd my sentiments on that occasion, I cannot have given him any just cause of offence.—Suffer me to assigna
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>presumptive reason or two, in support of the above opinion.</P>
<P>As Mr. Linley confesses his own want of judgment in the drama, (a defect scarce-pardonable in a Manager) he must be ne∣cessitated to submit the fate of pieces, of∣fer'd to the stage, to the decision of a person of known, or presum'd abilities. But how can he be sure that such person (tho' a compe∣tent judge) will always act with due impartia∣lity? Private friendship, or private pique to an Author may either bias his judgment, or warp his integrity. That Mr. Linley has been unfortunate in his choice of a dramatic Cen∣sor is too-evident. Who, or what this Censor is I don't pretend to know, but it is highly probable that he must either be a Person, who writes for the Stage, or an Actor. If the former, the caution given by our im∣mortal Bard is not inapplicable: viz. <Q>Let “”no such man be trusted.</Q> His opinion ought not to be decisive: as he may reject a piece of real merit, through a principle of lite∣rary jealousy, or recommend a flimsy play, as a foil to his own productions. If the latter, he is equally improper for a Cenfor; for though the piece may contain a part fitted to his theatrical powers, it may also contain a character, in which another performer would
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>cut a more capital figure. In such case, it is natural to suppose that he will reject the play.</P>
<P>This was the sailing of our celebrated Ros∣cius. Among other piecos, he rejected <HI>Dou∣glas,</HI> and <HI>Cleone,</HI> on account of the superiority of the female characters. Nay, I am almost convine'd (and in such opinion I am not sin∣gular) that he resus'd Dido for a similar rea∣son. He remark'd, that <Q>the play was writ∣ten “”for the woman</Q> (Mrs. CIBBER) <Q>and “”that the men</Q>—I ask pardon for using the coarse expression—"were only Sh—ts—chs." Yet <HI>Powell, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Bensley</HI> found no want of applause in their respective parts—Let me observe, that Mr. Garrick play'd in <HI>new</HI> pieces, when Dido was first offer'd to him. Had he not seen the tragedy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his return from <HI>Italy,</HI> it is more than probable that he would not have rejected it.</P>
<P>I waited till the close of the season, in hope, of hearing from the Manager during the the∣atrical vacation. In the beginning of August, I patch'd up this Appeal, and resolv'd to pub∣lish it on the very day, announc'd for the opening of Drury-lane theatre, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my tragedy was not accepted.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
<P>About a week before the commencement of the last season, I visited Mr. Wallis, and told him I had prepared for an attack. He dissua∣ded me from publication, by telling me he would, on Mr. Sheridan's coming to town, talk the affair over with him—I even suf∣fer'd the season to slip over without any far∣ther application, so great is my dislike to so∣licit favours—I had seriously ruminated on the consequence of my intended publications—By printing the tragedy, I clearly saw it would become public property, and might be exhibited at any patent theatre, by (what is call'd) <HI>prescriptive right,</HI> by which I should be depriv'd of the emoluments of representa∣tion—This loss, however, I laid no great stress on—I was also apprehensive that the tra∣gedy would be, with the utmost severity, at∣tack'd by some hireling literary assassins. The <HI>profound</HI> Critic, on whose judgment Mr. Lin∣ley so blindly depends, and whom I have rea∣son to suppose my implacable enemy, would doubtless, in justification of his <HI>given</HI> opini∣on, make use of some expedient pecuniary, or theatrical<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The freedom of the House.</NOTE> to have the reputation of my tragedy decried, or blasted.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
<P>In such embarrassing situation I shew'd the manuscript of this pamphlet to a few Gen∣tlemen, on whose judgment and integrity I could rely; but even here I found a contra∣riety of opinions. Some strongly advis'd me to send it to the Press, by way of prelude to the publication of the Narrative and Tra∣gedy, as the affair between Mr. Linley and me was evidently the cause of the Public. Others dissuaded me, as it would probably make the Manager my enemy, and conse∣quently more averse to the reception of any other of my pieces, which might be offer'd to Drury-lane theatre.</P>
<P>I still continued irresolute, in hopes that matters might be accommodated; and, to leave no stone unturn'd for effecting such pur∣pose, I even <HI>condescended</HI> to request the Manager's permission that one of the prin∣cipal Performers might have Dido for a benefit. This I could do with no other view, than in hopes of <HI>convincing</HI> him, that the tra∣gedy had sufficient merit to establish its existence as a STOCK-PLAY. To this <HI>hu∣miliating</HI> Request, (though I did not even desire either new dress or scene) I am sorry to say Mr. Linley absolutely resus'd his
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>consent; which is perhaps a greater stretch of theatrical DESPOTISM, than has been exer∣cis'd by any Manager during the present century.</P>
<P>How striking the contrast between Mr. Linley's CRUELTY to me, and his PARTI∣ALITY to another Dramatist! It would almost puzzle an able Casuist to decide in which par∣ticular the Manager's conduct merits the se∣verer reprehension—Two years ago, a tra∣gedy and a comedy (each of five acts writ∣ten by the <HI>same</HI> Author) were brought our at Drury-lane theatre—Did Mr. Garrick, though a known dupe to flattery, ever grant a similar indulgence to any of his dramatic Sycophants? Never. He knew that such unwarrantable preference would be look'd upon as an opening to a monopoly of stage emoluments, by which genius would be dis∣courag'd, and an act of injustice to Authors, the representation of whose pieces would be thereby procrastinated—The <HI>true</HI> mo∣tive of Mr. Linley's partiality to this Gentle. man is not publicly known, though many shrewed remarks were made on it, little to the credit of either Author or Manager.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
<P>Notwithstanding Mr. Linley's unjustifia∣ble refusal of the above request, I should possibly still have hesitated in respect of publication, if a Gentleman of his acquain∣tance had not lately hinted to one of my friends, that Dido would not be accepted at Drury-lane theatre, on account of my quarrel with Mr. Garrick. My Friend indeed ascribes this piece of unparallelled injustice to the <HI>pro∣found</HI> Critic's influence over Mr. Linley. In either case, I can hardly suppose, after the Manager's obstinate perseverance in refusing the tragedy, that any real Well-wither to dra∣matic genius, and the cause of literary liberty will blame me for publication.</P>
<P>I might here close my APPEAL, in <HI>full assu∣rance</HI> that every impartial reader will ima∣gine, I have been treated with unprece∣dented cruelty in the ARBITRARY REJEC∣TION of my tragedy, to say nothing of the comedy. To convince the world that I do not assert this through the usual partiality of the Poet, I beg leave to produce a CON∣CLUSIVE AUTHORITY from a great dramatic Genius and able Manager.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
<P>Mr. COLMAN (we are assur'd in the preface to <HI>Albina</HI>) thus express'd himself on a simi∣lar occasion—<Q>Where an Author of re∣putation “thinks proper to bring me a Piece, I don't think I have a RIGHT to deliberate—I am only the Midwife, and give it a safe delivery to the world—Where one does not know a Writer it is dif∣ferent.”</Q></P>
