<P>DISSIPATION.</P>
<P>A COMEDY, IN FIVE ACTS; AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN DRURY-LANE.</P>
<P>BY MILES PETER ANDREWS, ESQ.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Comedy having abided the decision of the public, having undergone the strictures of criticism, and, notwithstanding its numerous errors, having fortunately met with general approbation, the author hopes he may, in conjunction with other disposers of the drama, be indulged with a few re∣marks of his own.</P>
<P>The great objection to this play has been the want of plot, an objection which the author will not pre∣tend to dispute; but then he begs it may be consi∣dered, that his chief aim in writing was to draw a lively picture of the manners of high life, characte∣rised by an easy indifference to the vissicitudes of fortune, and a kind of indolent acceptance of every fashionable enjoyment; he therefore imagined an in∣tricacy of plot would ill accord with the delineation of personages, who would not themselves undergo the fatigue of engaging in a multiplicity of bnsiness, to promote either their dearest interests, or their fondest pleasures. To supply this defect, the author has endeavoured to support, through five acts, a pleasant laughable dialogue, heightened by stage situ∣ation; an undertaking, in his opinion, full as diffi∣cult as the invention of fable. How far he has suc∣ceeded, is now submitted to the candid consideration of the reader.</P>
<P>Having said thus much concerning the reception of the play before the curtain, it may be necessary to mention the treatment it has met with behind.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, it must be confessed, has taken away several <HI>witty</HI> things from this comedy, which proba∣bly would have had a <HI>striking</HI> and <HI>very violent</HI> effect; but should he, in his <HI>great dearth</HI> of genius, ever venture to introduce them in any future production
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
of his own, and the audience should not immediate∣ly perceive the <HI>difference,</HI> the original author will cer∣tainly put in his claim to all the merit they possess.</P>
<P>But to be serious—To the proprietors of the thea∣tre all thanks are due for their care, attention, and liberality in getting up this play; and to Mr. Lin∣ley in particular, for his politeness in offering, and his skill in composing, the music introduced in the third act.</P>
<P>Of the performers, for their diligence and their un∣rivalled talents, the author cannot say enough; like Sir Andrew Acorn, in the comedy, it is impossible for him to do them justice, and, therefore, he won't undertake it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Abington's elegant deportment, her perfect knowledge of polished life, the graceful ease and na∣tural sprightliness with which she plays the part of Lady Rentless, can only be equalled by the chearful∣ness and affability with which she accepted it.</P>
<P>Mr. King's excellence may not be dwelt upon, lest from the recollection of Puff, in the Critic, the real tribute of applause might force an improper smile.</P>
<P>Mr. Parsons—but it is impossible to be serious about him—from the moment he appears on the stage to the end of the piece, he neither walks, looks, or speaks, without calling forth the risibility of the audience; the part may have some merit, but with such support, that character must be poorly drawn indeed that would not please.</P>
<P>Mr. Palmer, Mr. Baddeley, and the rest of the performers, are equally intitled to the gratitude of the author, but for the critic reason, hinted at above, he will not venture to enlarge further on their com∣mendation.</P>

<LG>
<L>WHAT a strange title this is—Dissipation!—</L>
<L>Ideal whim!—the author's wild creation!</L>
<L>In this romantic, sentimental age,</L>
<L>Exists there such a folly—off the stage?</L>
<L>The satire's false—Our bard has wander'd much—</L>
<L>We're wise and prudent, as our friends—the Dutch.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Look to our careful Commons, frugal Lords;</L>
<L>No waste there—Yes—some little waste—of words.</L>
<L>But more there are, who thrifty rhetoric shew,</L>
<L>The close, mum eloquence of—Aye and No:</L>
<L>They mark <HI>Don Whiskerandos</HI> to a letter,</L>
<L>"And if it must, the less is said, the better."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See too his Grace amid New-market Sirs,</L>
<L>That deep fraternity of boots and spurs!</L>
<L>View him full dress'd—half flannel and half leather,</L>
<L>Up to twelve stone—or sweated to a feather.</L>
<L>In no profusion is he known to sin;</L>
<L>He takes fair pains—and sometimes more—to win;</L>
<L>But should the faithful dice for once run cross,</L>
<L>Not he—"my little Premium paysh de losh."</L>
<L>No falling trees or ruin'd farms deplore him,</L>
<L>His sires, good men! have made all smooth before him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In gentler bosoms does this folly reign!</L>
<L>First, at Salt Hill, of all the hunting train,</L>
<L>Behold the <HI>broad brim'd Dian</HI> of the day,</L>
<L>Top five-bar gates, and shew the field the way?</L>
<L>"Sure," cries some bridling dame, for scandal ready,</L>
<L>"These leaps are not so prudent in a lady.</L>
<L>"No, Ma'am! why not?—Grant Miss should have a fall,</L>
<L>"A friendly settlement will cover all."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In short, the rage of Dissipation's o'er;</L>
<L>The very clubs have voted it a—bore.</L>
<L><HI>Their</HI> paper currency is under par;</L>
<L>For gold <HI>they</HI> mutiny—or cut the war.</L>
<L>Nay, tho' a grave divine's convenient plan,</L>
<L>Invites to take some twenty wives a man,</L>
<L>The prudent soul rejects the blessings sent him▪</L>
<L>And finds—I hear at least—one wife content him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
<L>But should our headstrong bard have dar'd to-night,</L>
<L>In bold contempt of precedent, to write</L>
<L>Five comic acts, with mournful scenes unblest,</L>
<L>And only entertaining at the best,</L>
<L>To draw from rakes reform'd no—moral speeches—</L>
<L>No decent sentiments from Miss—in breeches—</L>
<L>In short, should he have penn'd a laughing play,</L>
<L>And rashly thrown some idle wit away,</L>
<L>Pray, gentlemen—I beg no hesitation—</L>
<L>Damn him! and shew you hate all Dissipation.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Written by the AUTHOR.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>FASHION's the word—again at her command</L>
<L>To mark her sovereign sway I take my stand,</L>
<L>All ranks alike adore my potent queen</L>
<L>From proud St. James's Square, to Bethnal-Green,</L>
<L>The titled dame not more her head can toss</L>
<L>Than the ship captain's wife, at Ratcliff-Cross,</L>
<L>Nor more contemptuous frowns the birth-night belle</L>
<L>Than does the drawn-up Miss, of Clerkenwell;</L>
<L><HI>All</HI> would be <HI>fine,</HI> the difference only—what?</L>
<L>Her Grace thinks <HI>this</HI> genteel, and Madam <HI>that.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fair of high descent and noble blood</L>
<L>Esteems it vulgar to be understood,</L>
<L>Proud of the worth her ancestors bequeath her</L>
<L>She thinks the gifts of Nature far beneath her</L>
<L>Rejects low talents that disgrace her station;</L>
<L>And scorns the meanness of articulation.</L>
<L>In a half whisper thus, our minds we tell</L>
<L>How'ch you do!—'t see you—'p you're very well.</L>
<L>Sir John, an urchin just emerg'd from school,</L>
<L><HI>Disdains with</HI> Hoyden girls, <HI>to</HI> play the fool.</L>
<L>"O curse the women all! but those who play</L>
<L>"How do you like my buckles? Made by <HI>Gray."</HI></L>
<L>"Dancing's a bore—and love sad stuff at best is,</L>
<L>"Damn it, I hate all dancing, but the Vestris."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In humbler life still fashion is the word</L>
<L>Full as fantastic and yet more absurd.</L>
<L>The great fat wife of some great fat shopkeeper</L>
<L>Deep in court-mourning grey, and somewhat deeper,</L>
<L>Cramm'd in a Hackney-coach at Cutler's Hall</L>
<L>Takes three coarse misses to the Mile-end ball;</L>
<L>Then, waddling up the room roars out to spouse</L>
<L>"Here's no good company at all, I vows,"</L>
<L>And there's Miss Pumpkin, dizen'd out in red,</L>
<L>Why don't you knows? Knows what? Why knows who's dead.</L>
<L>Dead! Lord have mercy, who? Our great third cousin</L>
<L>Adolphus-Wolfus-Peter Herring Bussen."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus thro' the world 'tis still our constant aim</L>
<L>To ape the follies we affect to blame,</L>
<L>But hold—methinks improvidently wise</L>
<L>We rashly censure what we ought to prize,</L>
<L>Ladies, for us exert this darling passion</L>
<L>Do, ton it here, and make this play the fashion.</L>

<P>Oh! I recollect, de parlement d'Angleterre, have in∣vent one title exprès, and I am charge in de tax bill, as Maitre d'Hotel to my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUSTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, our nobility are much oblig'd to the parliament for taking the trouble to distinguish their ser∣vants: but if I mistake not, this means master of the house, and that's a strange employment surely for a French—you understand me, in the service of an English peer.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUSTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, times are sadly changed; formerly, indeed, a day in the artillery ground once a year, and a review of the orange regiment, with a march to dinner, was quite suf∣ficient for a sober citizen; but now my master is stark staring mad, and has been lock'd up three hours a day for these two months past, to learn to salute; at his years to learn to salute.</P>

<SPEAKER>COQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainement! never too late for dat!</P>

<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>TRUSTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And worse still, since your lord has thought proper to appoint him to a light infantry company in his own regi∣ment; he has totally discarded his sober snuff-colour'd frock, grey silk stockings, and smooth powder'd bob, for a short jacket, loose boots, and a little helmet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, would you not have de good citizen defend his country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Undoubtedly, at a proper time of life, nothing can be more honourable or praiseworthy; but I would not have my old master run about making anticks, when he should be thinking only of making his will. Then Miss Maria—</P>

<SPEAKER>COQUIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mademoiselle Maria, ver sweet creature, vat of her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUSTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, she's always in regimentals too, prancing about the streets on horseback, or firing pistols at our goods in the shop; I dare say she has shot a dozen red-herrings thro' the head within these ten days.</P>

<P>Pardon me, my Lady; I had imagined, that a member of the British senate, did not give his vote, or speak his public sentiments merely for his amusement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure he does not; sometimes it is for the amuse∣ment of other people. But you are immensely ignorant, my dear Charles. Do you really suppose we give our∣selves the trouble to understand every subject we debate upon? Ha! ha! ha! some things, indeed, one can't help being familiar with, such as the national debt, or the ruin of one's country, or naturalizing a Jew, or—</P>

<P>True, I suppose the old Baronet will arrive soon, <HI>en-fa∣mille;</HI> upon my word this will be an immense good match for you, Charles, that's poz. Sir Andrew Acorn, tho' a sad country clown, to say the truth, has a very fine estate, and is of a most encouraging age for a father-in-law.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and Miss, tho' a mere rustic, with her head full of love and conjugal affection, and so on; yet I have no doubt, my Lord, when she has liv'd a little among us, she will soon be wean'd from her absurdities.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, who, my dear Charles, says any such thing? But, wou'd you have this wife of yours distracted for you, whining for your absence, and jealous of every woman you speak to? Upon my honour, I don't know any thing half so troublesome—hah, Lady Rentless?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dreadful, my Lord! but Charles is so romantic: now do but observe how we live together. Is my Lord ever vexatiously uneasy on my account? Or am I ridiculously anxious on his? Yet, we are always chearful when met, and happy when separate: are not we, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, perfectly so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Charles, you must got quit of these vulgar no∣tions; you are as bad as Lady Pure: I'll tell you, my Lord; you know the Dowager, she is always dream∣ing about propriety; well, she teaz'd me to death the other night at the Festino, for a list of my next week's engage∣ments, wanting me to sit an evening with her, as she calls it.—Ma'am, says I, on Sunday I must be at Lady Brag's, Monday at the Pantheon, Tuesday and Wednes∣day, several private parties, Thursday we see masks, Fri∣day I go forty miles to play Venus in Lady Scribble∣dum's petite piece, on Saturday I return to the opera, and—But an't this a little inconsistant, cried she, with his Lord∣ship's unhappy situation? Unhappy situation, Lady Pure! you rave! my Lord is the gayest man in town; always alive; always in company; keeps the best table; runs the best matches; listened to in the House; ador'd by the wo∣men; respected by the men; full of wit; full of gallantry, 'twould do your Ladyship good to have a tête à téte with him; upon which up she started, and I never set eyes on her afterwards.</P>

A delightful figure he will out amongst my company! but I must humour the fel∣low, for between his roguery and my Lord's folly, I have been absolutely defrauded of my diamonds; but if I can fairly recover my own trinkets, and at the same time justly mortify my Lord's pride by a little innocent trea∣chery with this Jew, I am sure no woman of feeling or enterprize will blame me.

<P>Zounds! this is like an introduction to the Grand Sig∣nior! Well, child, I hope you are not fatigued with your journey, tho' a pretty good distance this from Acorn-hall, and might tire a stronger constitution than yours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I am not in the least fatigued, the novelty of every thing around me would prevent that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why true, child, every thing is new to you, and to me too, I think; I intended to have got here just before dinner, and breakfast is scarce over on our arrival. My

Lady Rentless, too, beginning to dress! Ah, I don't like this affectation of making good breeding inconsistent with good hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>These, I suppose, Sir, are trifling differences, that certain ranks will always indulge in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know that; but when certain ranks pride them∣selves only upon such distinctions, it shews me they have no better to boast of; but come, child, I won't be cen∣sorious; Lord and Lady Rentless are young, his father was a very intimate friend of mine, and on that account, as well as on yours, I have been induced to make this visit; but I hope Charles has not been corrupted by bad example.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I think it is impossible; and you, when you last saw him, was of the same opinion.</P>

<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, but times alter, and young men change. How∣ever, I am no croaker: but such a guardian as Lord Rentless, and such a school of education as London.—</P>

<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You said, Sir, you would not be censorious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you I am not censorious; have-n't I lived all my life in the country, and do you suppose I don't know the world? Mark me, I don't mean the world as it is, but the world as it should be. I hope, now, when you are married to Charles, notwithstanding your fortune will be large—I mean after my death—for don't imagine I will leave myself a beggar.</P>

<P>Believe me, my dear Sir, I have no such wish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so, but I hope that when you do marry, I say, that you will not think of keeping such a parade of

<P>Don't I tell you, I hate contradiction; remember, I tell you, a complying disposition is the foundation of matrimonial happiness.</P>

<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, my dear papa, that you have not seen in me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say I have, but marriage makes great alteration; I was sometimes apt to be a little fretted myself; but then your mother and I lived entirely in the country, and had a great deal of time upon our hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I must do you the justice to agree—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say that; we had our quarrels too, but then they made matrimony the sweeter, otherwise we should scarce have known the value of regard; and if it were not for interruption—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But sure, Sir,—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, but you do not; for I was going to assure you, that the stile of living, and the manners of Lord and Lady Rentless, which I see you disapprove, are as unpleasing to me as—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Charles, indeed I should be unhappy if—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, I foresaw your apprehensions. But rest assured, my dearest Harriot, that tho' Lord Rentless is my guardian, and it seem'd my father's will that I should live immediately under his Lordship's eye, yet I entirely dislike his mode of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, entirely, no doubt of it. Who would have imagined, when you came in a discreet manner to solicit the honour of my fair hand after our meeting at Scar∣bro', that the sentimental Charles Woodbine was the ward of one of the most fashionable libertines about town. Ought you not to be asham'd of cheating the heart of a poor simple girl into approbation? Mind, I only say approbation; nothing more.</P>

<P>O fye! And can you think that I, who propose to pass my life in a quiet, good, domestic way in the country, watching my flowering shrubs, nursing my birds, and, and—in short, do you imagine I will give my hand to a man who is wedded to this dissipated town? Oh, no.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good Lord, came early on purpose to look on you, and give you my <HI>passavant</HI> for the day. But how does your Ladyship? Favour me with your fin∣ger—Ah! bon, bon—Your Ladyship's pulse is in delicious order.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Doctor, I find myself greatly recovered from my yesterday's <HI>ennui.</HI> That nabob's wife, with her tawdry hangings, and gilt girandoles, quite overcame me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>The effect upon the animal spirits must indeed have been shocking. But your Ladyship seems somewhat <HI>abattû</HI> to-day. I fear you have not left off vanilla in your chocolate, and put amber in its place. Do you confine yourself to claret of the vintage seventy-five, carefully put up in champaigne bottles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Carefully put up in champaigne bottles! Pray, Sir, do you look on that of so much consequence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inexpressible—the smallest circumstance may dis∣order the whole nervous system. The thickness of a
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
phial, or the position of a cork, may destroy a pa∣tient inevitably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I be so bold as to ask, Sir, if you practise physic?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Physic! throw physic to the dogs. I am an admi∣rer of the art, an <HI>amateur</HI> as one may say: but my practice is confined to the sensations. I raise, or I as∣swage nervous sensibility—not but that I sometimes use more desperate remedies—there are instances where I have been known to prescribe essence of peaches, or the more poignant juice of pines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pines and peaches! One would swear he was a gardiner. I see, Sir, you have made botany your chief study.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Botany! Oh, no—Electricity! tepid baths, soft airs, beautiful objects, Lady Rentless! The exercise of hazard, my Lord, for the arms and lungs, and that of dancing for the legs and body, with now and then a gentle trill upon the lute—This is my art—these are my prescriptions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charming physician! Are you not in raptures, Sir Andrew?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, my Lady, I must say the <HI>materia medica</HI> is much alter'd of late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; such a method might not altogether suit your habit, for you are in a most dangerous state, Sir Andrew, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dangerous state! Me, Sir! Why I never was

ill in my life, but once with the small pox, and ano∣ther time when I was found amongst the dead in the service of my country at an election feast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the worse, Sir; so much the worse—You are indeed in a forc'd state of robustness, which some people denominate health; but here is my Lord, who, tho' as pale as a sheet, and has even paralytic tenden∣cies <STAGE>[Lord <HI>Rentless</HI> starts.]</STAGE> may outlive you. I would almost ensure his life for three months to come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, you and I, Sir Andrew, seem to be in a very hopeful situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you see how dangerous it is to live in the country and fancy yourself well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a forced state of robustness, Sir Andrew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure it's better to enjoy all the advantages of London, as pale as a sheet, with paralytic tendencies, my Lord—No, no, let physicians say what they please, I will fancy—no, I won't fancy—for I am certain I never was better in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive me, Sir Andrew; there seems a small irri∣tation upon your nerves, which inclines you to be a little positive or so, but I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I say, it is no such thing—</P>

<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Miss Uniform, there is not the least occa∣sion to be alarmed. Here's no danger in being seen here. People of the first fashion visit their acquaint∣ance at this hotel, and you may rely upon me, my ho∣nour.</P>

<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my Lord, but if you should forget <HI>your</HI> honour, what would become of <HI>mine?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! my charming apprehensive girl, believe me you are in perfect security; besides, I am a married man, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the more dangerous. You married men have a privilege from your situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but then you know we are always to be trust∣ed; for we are suppos'd at least to be attach'd to our wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what would be suppos'd, if we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re seen thus to∣gether?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to confess the truth, it was upon that account that I took the tender liberty of requesting a meeting at this hotel, merely on that account; as public walks are exposed; prudes censorious; and the world too apt to put wrong constructions on the best designs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but if any of the world should happen to ob∣serve us here, and put wrong constructions.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, my Lord—for if you should have ano∣ther conceit, and happen to hide them, I may perhaps not happen to find them out again; but as your Lordship seems conversant with all the doors in this house, will you

<P>Well, well, be quick. You are as long making me up as an old dowager on a birth day.</P>

<P>Thank God, all the reviews are over for this year—and a pretty dance I have had—crost the Thames fifteen times out of sport—charg'd thro' twenty thickets for diver∣sion, and gallopp'd over Chatham barracks to take a fly∣ing inspection.—But now for my sister, to enquire into her family regulations since I left town—I suppose Charles's marriage is all settled, and I have only just to step in to eat some wedding cake, and see whether the bride blushes on the occasion.</P>

<P>Ah, Trusty, I always told you, that orderly plan of his would produce nothing but confusion—But why tell me this nonsense?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROBE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very spirited, i'faith—But what is this for?</P>

<P>Why, Sir—(I hope nobody will hear us)—I under∣stand that my master, not finding my Lord at home, went to a hotel in pursuit of him, and there he caught his Lord∣ship and Miss together.</P>
</SP>

<P>How! But I hope nothing amiss had happen'd?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROBE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! how! Dissipation on all sides!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUSTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, it has made a fine confusion in the family. And it is whisper'd too, that my Lord has not been over scrupulous in the management of his ward's affairs—great deficiencies I hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROBE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You astonish me! But how again? Indeed certain

monies were left in his power to lay out for Charles's advantage—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUSTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, he has laid them out for somebody's advan∣tage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROBE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And there were estates to be sold to pay off some incum∣brances—</P>

<P>Instead of which, I fear, the incumbrances have encrea∣sed.</P>

<P>It can't happen, I tell you—it must be utterly impos∣sible, that a peer of this country, whose honour is his oath, can condescend to break through a solemn engage∣ment on any account whatever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TRUSTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It should be impossible, General—but great men get over difficulties—However, I must now hurry home to my master—he talks of speaking to this Lord in an ho∣nourable way too—the devil take such honour, I say.</P>

<P>Why, child, you know when I consented to this match of yours, that gentleman there informed me of his being immediately to possess a very large property, which I very readily believed, imagining that no person of character could—But I beg pardon.

<P>Yes, Sir, from being one of the most envied, I am now the most miserable of mankind.</P>

<P>I know, General, all your goodness, and therefore scru∣ple not to inform you, that my Lord Rentless dishonour∣ably abusing the trust that was reposed in him, has sacri∣ficed my fortune to his own purposes, while my total ig∣norance of this transaction has made me appear the mean mercenary cheat that wanted to impose upon the honour, the generosity, the love—I cannot proceed further.</P>

<P>Yes, Sir Andrew, there is one thing known and agreed upon every where, that no extravagance or necessity should tempt a man to violate his trust. But let us not be unkind; something may be allowed to the incaution of youth, and something to the too general dissipation of the times.</P>

<SPEAKER>ALDERMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dress to the right; if the General thinks so, my daughter shall be angry no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear, papa, I never was angry at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALDERMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold your tongue, child, I say you was. Well, old Labradore, remember I told you, though you had got into the line, you might pay for promotion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LABRADORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yesh, <HI>young</HI> Uniform; but I shall take the means to be <HI>repaid</HI> with interest immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Mr. Labradore, remember our bargain was only for hereafter, and I'm sure my Lord will in proper time fulfil the engagement—but let me do one piece of imme∣diate justice. Come, Sir Andrew, with your consent I'll place this hand where I know it will be most valued. <STAGE>[Taking Harriot.]</STAGE> Poor thing! it shan't go into the country to enjoy a <HI>téte-à-t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te</HI> with its papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles, I have done you wrong; and it shall be the business of my life to do you justice—no, that's impos∣sible, so I won't undertake it; therefore, Harriot, do you make him all the recompence you can.</P>

<SPEAKER>LABRADORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't hear a wordsh.</P>

<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Mr. Labradore, there was a time when I could persuade you to any thing—even to the parting with your securities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as I have undertaken to replace their value, your resentment should subside.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LABRADORE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, my Lorsh, if I recover my monish, I shall think less to loosh my daughter; so, Mounsheer, presherve your principles, and you shall come and be one of the goodsh short.</P>

<SPEAKER>ALDERMAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, Ephy, if you want to make your son a gentle∣man, put him on a jacket.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROBE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, my friends, as harmony seems again restored, we will now retire to celebrate the union of this deserving couple; and at the same time let us reflect, that the pre∣sent rage for dissipation, by treating lightly all the serious engagements of life, is at once the bane of filial affection, parental tenderness, and nuptial love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ANDREW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, my worthy friend, and should any here venture to dispute your assertions, I shall not hesitate to declare—But I beg pardon—I never contradict this company.</P>
