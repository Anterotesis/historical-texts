<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS Archaeological science most certainly excells Chinese gardening, and as a President of the Society of Anti∣quaries takes precedence (at least on English ground) of a Knight of the Polar star, I flatter myself, that in point of sub∣ject, and choice of the personage to whom I address myself, I may vie with the inimitable author of the celebrated <HI>Heroic Epistle</HI>. I shall, however, forbear to enter the lists with him as a poet, or march in the rear of his numerous host of imi∣tators: my modesty prevents the one, and my vanity the other. Instead therefore of writing heroically, I shall write Archaeologically; or, to speak more properly, Heroico-Ar∣chaeologically, employing a style and manner, of which there is at present only one exemplar in the known world, and of which, I trust, the following epistle will be found an abso∣lute <HI>facsimile</HI>. And I am the rather inclined to do this, be∣cause I am credibly informed, that many formidable critics are still attempting to disprove the authenticity of my origi∣nal. Now, should they succeed in this attempt, the reader easily perceives, that I may claim a kind of <HI>fee-simple</HI> right to this style by way of direct inheritance: for, should all the old chests in all the parish churches of the kingdom, after a
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
pregnancy of four centuries, choose to bring forth a tuneful progeny of pastorals, tragedies, epic poems, and what not, it cannot be imagined, that the said chests will ever pretend, that they were impregnated in the same wonderful manner, and by the same occult personage, with that of St. Mary Red∣clift. I must, therefore, if her pretty bantlings be proved suppositious, or illegitimate, necessarily rise up the first Ar∣chaeological Poet in Great Britain.</P>
<P>In this eventful moment, therefore, of literary suspence, let not any rash reader presume to say, that I imitate Rowley; for then another will as peremptorily answer, that I imitate Chatterton. And if, on the contrary, he asserts that I emu∣late Chatterton, the learned personage, whom I address, will be in gratitude bound to prove, that I emulate Rowley; which I own, indeed, I should like best, because then I should run a fair chance of excelling Homer, Theocritus, and the best poets of antiquity. But, be this as it may, I only say of myself simply and modestly, that I write Archaeological∣ly; and, as a most profound <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bryant's Observations, p. 29.</NOTE> etymologist has lately proved that a writer must know his own meaning (a comfortable truth to know, in an age, in which so many authors write without any meaning) resting on his great authority, and taking for granted that I do know my own meaning, I profess only to write in common plain English first, and afterwards to un∣spell it, and unanglicize it, by means of that elaborate glos∣sary, which Dr. Milles has fabricated for the use of the read∣ers
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
of my original. Pity! great pity, indeed, it is, that while he was doing this, he did not also fabricate another for his imitators. Had he done this, and placed the modern words before the Archaeological ones, it is certain the greatest part of my labour had been saved.</P>
<P>To supply this great desederatum, it is my intention (after my own fame is by my present production fully established) to write a complete Art of Archaeological poetry in the man∣ner of Mr. Bysshe; and not only this, but to add to it a com∣plete Anglo-Gothico-Saxonico-Chattertonic dictionary for the use of tiros. For this latter work I shall, however, order my bookseller to article with Dr. Johnson, or any other writer in the trade (the Doctor, having been a dictionary-maker, might perhaps be the fittest) who, for a specified sum, or sheet by sheet, as they shall agree, may transpose Dr. Milles's glossary in the way above-mentioned, so that for any given English word the Gothico-Saxonico-Chattertonic, or any thing but English synonyme, may be immediately found. When this dictionary is duly formed, I will be bold to say, that this mode of writing will be found so easy, that every miss and master in the kingdom will be enabled to puzzle not only our old Society of Antiquaries here in England, but also that new Scotch one, which either is, or is about to be founded under the auspices of the Earl of Buchan.</P>
<P>On hinting this scheme to one of my friends, he told me it was not likely that Dr. Johnson would undertake the task, because were this style to become the fashion, it would eclipse his own. The objection seemed plausible at first, but, on re∣flection,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
I can see little weight in it. The merit of the Doc∣tor's style is known to consist in his long words, hard words, and stiffly-constructed sentences. Now the style which I have the honour to recommend, although there are a few long words in it, such as <HI>amenused, cherisaunied</HI>, &amp;c. &amp;c. yet they are not nearly so long, or so numerous, as those of the Doctor's own coinage. Hard words too, I own, are to be found in it; but these only because they are obsolete, and not like his, brought in through affectation, but from sheer necessity. Then, as to the construction of whole sentences, nothing in the world is so totally dissimilar, as the Lexipha∣nic and Archaeologic manner: the one is <HI>swotie, mole</HI>, and <HI>fe∣tive</HI>; the other <HI>rugose, cacophonous</HI>, and <HI>dentifrangent</HI>.</P>
<P>Another reason, which my friend gave, why the Doctor would probably not undertake this employment, was, that he entertained heterodox notions concerning my Archetype, the immortal Rowley <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His reason for this heterodoxy is probably this, that Rowley having never had any life at all, there was do probability that any bookseller would ever pay him for becoming his biographer.</NOTE>. But what then? Did not the Doctor once entertain heterodox notions concerning the right of the Hanover succession? And if a pension from the Treasury could cure him of the latter, why may not a pension from my bookseller cure him of the former? My money is as good as a Prime Minister's, and as (according to the old proverb) money makes the mare to go, so will it make his spavined pen flounder over any ground, dirty or clean, provided only that it be excused from taking that road, which leads to the real interests of his Sovereign, or the constitutional liberty of
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
his fellow-subjects. Taking it, therefore, for granted that, if we come up to his price (which, I trust, the sale of the pre∣sent work will enable me to do) the Doctor will engage in the task, I shall point out, with much brevity, a few of the many advantages that will accrue to the rising generation of poets, if, quitting a mode of versifying already grown thread∣bare, they would adopt this, which both by example and ex∣hortation I here recommend to them. In the first place let me assure them, that they will hereby find rimes as plenty as blackberries: for as Archaeology introduces a whole regi∣ment of new-old words, and gives one leave either to use them or not, just as we please, it is plain that now it will be full as easy to write in rime as in blank verse, or even in plain prose. And, to shew that I do not make a false asser∣tion, I will produce one instance out of a thousand from my original, and that from the famous <HI>Songe to Aella</HI>. The poet had in one line written:
<Q>"Beesprengedd all the <HI>mees</HI> wythe gore."</Q>
In a subsequent stanza he writes:
<Q><L>"Orr seest the hatchedd stede</L>
<L>"Ypraunceyng o'er the <HI>mead</HI>."</L></Q>
Now <HI>mees</HI> being the Archaeological word, and <HI>mead</HI> the mo∣dern English one, it is plain he thought himself at liberty to write modern English, whenever rime required him to do so. Another benefit is, that the poet will be almost entirely emancipated from the vile shackles of grammar; a point so clear, that the reader has only to cast his eye on any page in my Exemplar, to find Priscian's head broken by the poet,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
and healed by his commentator with equal facility. As to or∣thography, there is only one rule, and that the most simple that can be imagined (which, however, it is not necessary constantly to regard) and this is, to put as many letters as you can possibly croud into a word, and then rest assured, that that word will look truly Archaeological.</P>
<P>But the last and best thing I shall mention is that great and unspeakable emolument, which the Anglo-Saxon prefix <HI>y</HI> brings to a necessitated versifier: as <HI>yprauncing</HI> for <HI>praunc∣ing, ymenging</HI> for <HI>menging</HI>, &amp;c. &amp;c. By having this always at his beck, that poet, who cannot write a smooth line in any given number of syllables, deserves, in my opinion, never to write a line at all. For this dear little <HI>y</HI> comes and goes just as one pleases, and may truly be called the Archaeological Poet's Toad-Eater. In short, with a little variation, we may apply that eulogy to it, which Dryden has given to St. Caeci∣lia's music: it hath
<Q><L>Enlarg'd the former narrow bounds,</L>
<L>And added length to <HI>any</HI> sounds.</L></Q>
Such, with a great many more, are the advantages, that at∣tend this style of poetry. It is not, therefore, I think, great∣ly to be wondered at, that either a priest of the fifteenth century, or that a boy at fifteen years of age (take which you please) should write with greater facility at least, if not greater spirit, than those miserable vernacular poets, who are so poor, comparatively, in point of rime, that they have not one to throw at a dog; who are tied so tight to the whip∣ping-post
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
of grammar, and fixed so fast in the stocks of or∣thography, that they have hardly an idea at liberty; and, which is worst of all, cannot eke out a halting line by any other method, than a totally different expression. Oh! if you reflect coolly on these things, my dear brethren of the quill, I am fully persuaded that all of you, like me, will turn Archaeologists.</P>
<P>Having thus cursorily shewn what great benefits this style confers upon writers, I might now proceed to prove what su∣perior delectation it affords to readers. But here I am fore∣stalled by the learned Dean, who, in his preliminary and all his other masterly dissertations on the works of my prede∣cessor, has irrefragably proved the point. Indeed, as presi∣dent of the Society of Antiquaries, and editor of their va∣luable <HI>Archaeologia</HI>, he has, I think, an absolute prescriptive right to dissert on this subject. I am not therefore without my hopes, that he will one day comment on the following epistle, which, if it want any thing, I am bold to say, wants only the illustrative notes of so sagacious an editor.</P>
<P>P. S. I have lately conceived that, as Dryden, Pope, &amp;c. employed their great talents in translating Virgil, Homer, &amp;c. that it would be a very commendable employment for the poets of the present age to treat some of the better sort of their predecessors, such as Shakspeare and Milton, in a simi∣lar manner, by putting them into Archaeological language. This, however, I would not call <HI>translation</HI>, but <HI>transmuta∣tion</HI>, for a very obvious reason. It is, I believe, a settled
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
point among the critics, with Dr. Johnson at their head, that the greatest fault of Milton (exclusive of his political tenets) is, that he writ in blank verse. See then and admire how easily this might be remedied.
<Q><BIBL>PARADISE LOST, Book I.</BIBL>
<L>Offe mannes fyrste bykrous volunde wolle I singe,</L>
<L>And offe the fruicte offe yatte caltysnyd tre</L>
<L>Whose lethal taste into thys worlde dydde brynge</L>
<L>Bothe morthe and tene to all posteritie.</L></Q>
How very near also (in point of dramatic excellence) would Shakspeare come to the author of <HI>Aella</HI>, if some of his best pieces were thus transmuted! As for instance the soliloquy of Hamlet, "<HI>To be, or not to be</HI>."

But I throw these trifles out, only to whet the appetite of the reader, for what he is to feast on in the subsequent pages.</P>

<L>O mighty Milles, who o'er the realms of sense</L>
<L>Hast spread that murky antiquarian cloud,</L>

<L>Which makes a beardless boy a monkish priest,</L>
<L>Makes Homer string his lyre, and Milton ape his jest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reverend Editor proves, in his manner, that numberless passages, in the Battle of Hastings, are not only borrowed from the original Greek of Homer, but also greatly im∣proved. In the same way he has, with peculiar sagacity, found out, "that the <HI>grave</HI> Milton, in his PENSEROSO, <HI>amused</HI> himself by <HI>reflecting</HI> on the <HI>buskin'd</HI> tale of Chaucer in these lines:
<Q><L>Or call up him that left half-told</L>

Just as Rowley had reflected on him before for not finishing his stories. See note on the Epistle to Mastre Canynge, p. 167.
