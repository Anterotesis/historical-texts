<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T length comes into the world, <HI>The first Volume of the History of the Rebellion, and Civil Wars in England, begun in the Year 1641, with the precedent Pas∣sages and Actions, that contri∣buted thereunto, and the Hap∣py End and Conclusion thereof, by the King's blessed Restora∣tion, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and Return, upon the 29<SUP>t</SUP>h of May in the Year 1660;</HI> Written by <HI>Edward Earl of Clarendon,</HI> once Lord High Chan∣cellor of <HI>England,</HI> and Chancellor of the Famous University of <HI>Oxford.</HI> The first of these great Dignities King <HI>Charles</HI> the second had conferr'd on him, whilst he was yet in Banishment with him; which he held, after the Restoration, above seven Years, with the Universal Approbation of the whole Kingdom, and the General Applause of all good Men, for his Justice, Integrity, sound Judgement, and Eminent Sufficiency in the discharge of that Office; a Praise, which none of his Enemies ever denied him, in any Time:
<PB N="II" REF="70"/>
The other he received from the Choice of the University; who, upon the Vacancy of that Place, by the death of the Marquis of <HI>Hert∣ford,</HI> then Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> judged they could not better mani∣fest their steddiness in the Cause, for which they had suffer'd, and their Resolutions of adhering to their old Principles, in support of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Ancient Monarchical Govern∣ment of this Kingdom, than in choosing to place the Protection of their Interest in both, under the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are of one, who had so early distinguished himself, even from the first Approaches of the Civil War, in asserting and maintaining the distressed Rights of the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Church and Crown.</P>
<P>This History was first begun by the express Command of King <HI>Charles</HI> the first; who, having a desire, that an account of the Calamities, God was pleased to inflict on the Unhappy part of his Reign, should be reported to Posterity by some worthy, honest, and knowing Man, thought he could not appoint any one, more adorn'd with such Qualifications, than this Author.</P>
<P>It is a difficult Province to write the History of the Civil Wars of a great and powerful Nation, where the King was engaged with one Part of his Subjects against the other, and both sides were <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> sufficiently inflamed: And the Necessity of speaking the Truth of several Great Men, that were engaged in the Quarrel on either side, who may still have very considerable Relations, descended from them, now alive, makes the Task Invidious, as well as Difficult.</P>
<P>We are not ignorant that there are Accounts, contained in this following History, of some Eminent Persons in those times, that do not agree with the relations we have met with of the same Persons, published in other Authors. But, besides that they who put forth this History, dare not take upon them to make any Al∣terations in a work of this kind, solemnly left with them to be <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> published, when ever it should be published, as it was delivered to them; they cannot but think the world will generally be of opi∣nion, that others may as likely have been mistaken in the grounds, and informations they have gone upon, as our Author; who will be esteem'd to have had opportunities, equal at least with any others, of knowing the truth; and, by the candor, and impartiality of
<PB N="III" REF="80"/>
what he relates, may be believed not to have made any wilful mistakes.</P>
<P>However, all things of this Nature must be submitted, as this is, with great deference to the judgement of the equal Reader; who will meet, in his progress through this work, with many Passages, that, he will judge, may disoblige the Posterity of even well mean∣ing Men in those days; much more then of such as were crafty, cunning, and wicked enough to design the mischiefs that ensued: But he shall meet with none of Malice, nor any but such as the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Author, upon his best information, took to be Impartially true. He could not be ignorant of the Rules of a good Historian (which, <HI>Cicero</HI> says, <HI>are such foundations, that they are known to every body) That he should Not dare to speak any False∣hood; and should dare to speak any Truth.</HI> And We doubt not, but through the whole progress of this History, he will be found to have given no occasion of suspecting his writings <HI>guilty of par∣tial favour, or unjust enmity;</HI> and we hope, that the repre∣senting the Truth, without any mixture of private Passion or Animosity, will be so far from giving offence to any Ingenuous Man <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of this time, that it will be received rather as an Instruction to the present Age, than a Reproach upon the last.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Tenderness that might seem due, out of Charity, good Manners, and good Nature, to our Country Men, our Neigh∣bours, or our Relations, hath been indulged a long space of time; and might possibly be abused, if it should not give way, at last, to the usefulness of making this work publick, in an Age, when so many Memoirs, Narratives, and pieces of History come out, as it were on purpose to justify the taking up Armes against that King, and to blacken, revile, and ridicule the sacred Majesty of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> an Anointed head in distress; and when so much of the Sense of Religion to God, and of Allegiance and Duty to the Crown, is so defaced, that it is already, within little more than fifty Years since the Murther committed on that Pious Prince, by some Men made a Mystery to judge, on whose side was the Right, and on which the Rebellion is to be charged.</P>
<P>We hope therefore it will be judged necessary as well as useful,
<PB N="IV" REF="90"/>
that an impartial Account of the most material Passages of those unhappy times should at last come out; and that We shall have the general Approbation, for having contributed thus far to Awaken Men to that Honesty, Justice, Loyalty, and Piety, which formerly English Men have been valuable for, and without which it is impossible any Government, Discipline, or Authority can be long maintain'd.</P>
<P>There is no doubt, but this good King had some Infirmities, and Imperfections; and might thereby be misled into some mistakes in Government, which the Nation, in Parliament represented, might <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> have reformed by moderate and peaceful Counsels. But the Re∣formation lost it's Name, and it's Nature too, when so many Acts, passed by him in Parliament, that did restrain the Prerogative of the Crown from doing the Mischiefs it had been taxed with, had not the effect they ought to have met with, of restraining the People too from farther demands; and when the inordinate Am∣bition, Anger, and Revenge of some of the great Leaders could not be limited within any Bounds, till they had involved the Na∣tion in Blood, destroyed many Thousands of their own Country Men, and fellow Citizens, and brought at last their own Soveraign to <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> lose his Head on a Scaffold, under a pretended form of an High Court of Jus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice, unprecedented from the Beginning of the World; and, to finish their work, had overthrown all the Laws of their own Country, in the defence of which, they would have had it thought, they had been obliged to draw their Swords.</P>
<P>Without question, every body, that shall duly consider the whole Account of these Transactions, will be able to impute mistakes, miscarriages, and faults enough to both sides: And we shall leave them to their own sedate and composed Reflections. But We can∣not omit making this one Observation, that where any King by ill <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Judgement, or ill Fortune, of his own, or those entrusted by him in the chief administration of his Government, happens to fall into an Interest contrary to that of his People, and will pursue that mistake, that Prince must have terrible conflicts in the course of his Reign, which way soever the Controversy ends: On the other hand, that People, who, tho' invaded and oppressed in their just Rights and
<PB N="V" REF="100"/>
Liberties, shall not rest satisfied with reasonable reparations and securities, but, having got power into their hands, will make un∣justifiable Use of it, to the utter Subversion of that Government they are bound in Duty and Allegiance to support, do but at last make Rods for their own Backs, and very often bring upon them∣selves, from other hands, a more severe Bondage than that they had shook off.</P>
<P>To demonstrate this General Observation, let it be consider'd in Particular, what was the Advantage this poor Nation gain'd <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> from all the Victories obtain'd over King <HI>Charles</HI> in the Field, and, afterwards, in the imprisoning, and prosecuting him to death: What amends did it make for the Infringement and Prejudice, they complain'd of, in their Rights and Liberties, to set up the Protector <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who, under a thousand Artifices and Cruelties, in∣tended no other Reformation, but, instead of Whips, to chastise the poor People with Scorpions; and, instead of their Idol Common-wealth, which some had vainly imagined to themselves, to make himself that very hated thing, a King, which had been so abomi∣nable in his own sight? And after him, what did all the other se∣veral <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> sorts of Government, set up sometimes to gratify the Am∣bition of one Party, and sometimes of another, end in, but so many several ways of Oppression; which, after many Years spent in exhausting the Blood and Treasure of their Country, at length made way for the happy Restoration of the Son, and Family of that King (whom they had so barbarously brought to an untimely end) with the utmost scorn and derision of all that had pretended to Rule in his stead?</P>
<P>Here We might descend into Particulars, to make out the other part of our Observation, by giving Instances, how some of our own <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Kings have, unhappily, been led into very dangerous mistakes in their Government; and how many Years have passed almost in one perpetual Strife, and unfortunate contention between the Prince and the People, in Points of the highest consequence; and especially those, which have brought the Prince, sometimes, under the disad∣vantageous suspicion of being inclined to the love of Arbitrary Power, and favouring the Popish Religion; than which the most
<PB N="VI" REF="110"/>
mortal Enemys to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> cannot possibly contrive, or wish, more miserable circumstances for it to be involved in. But We are rather desirous to draw a Veil over all the Calamities, that have proceeded from this Cause; as well because the impressions those mistakes have made, and the marks they have left behind them, will not easily be worn out; as that it might look like insult∣ing over Their misfortunes, who have been the Chief Losers by them; which We have, in no kind, the Inclination, or the Heart to do: Neither would we be thought to give Countenance, by what We write, to the opinions of those, who would Justify the rising <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> up in Armes of Subjects, to do themselves Right in any Controversy between them and their King.</P>
<Q><L>Non haec in foedera—</L></Q>
<P>The Nature of our excellent Government hath provided, in the Constitution of it, other remedies, in a Parliamentary way; where∣in both the Prerogative of the Crown, and the Rights of the Peo∣ple may be better secured: And besides, we know to whom Ven∣geance peculiarly belongs, and that he who challenges that power to Himself, will not suffer it to be communicated to any other. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>But We should think our selves very fortunate, if, in the Re∣flections we have been making on this Subject, We have represented the truth, on both sides, with that fairness and Impartiality, in the perplex'd condition of our own affairs, that all Princes may see and judge, that it can never turn to their advantage, to be in an Interest contrary to that of their People, nor to give their Subjects unreasonable Provocations. For (as in other Cases, where the Laws both of God and Man are too often broken, tho' very strict and positive, so in this point too) the People may not always be restrained from attempting by force to do themselves Right, tho' <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> they Ought not.</P>
<P>And we hope no less, that the People will be convinced, that it were wiser, and better for them, to obtain the redress of their grievances by such ways, as the ancient Laws of this Kingdom have provided: And that the Constitution of King, Lords, and Commons, is the happiest Composition of Government in the world;
<PB N="VII" REF="120"/>
and so suited to the Nature of English men generally, that tho' it be expelled for a time, yet it will return.</P>
<P>We would therefore heartily wish both for Prince and People, if either of them should be guilty of any irregular Deviations from their own Channels, that they who are injured would content themselves with gentle Applications, and moderate Remedies, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the last error be worse than the first: And above all, that whoso∣ever may have a thought of Ruling in this Land, may be throughly convinced in his own judgement, that it is a Crown of Briers and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Thorns that must be set on his head, without he can satisfy all reasonable Men, that it is his fixed Principle and Resolution, in∣violably to defend our Religion, and preserve our Laws.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, We have often wonder'd, and rest still amazed, that any Prince should care to govern a People against their Nature, their Inclinations, and their Laws. What Glory can it be to a Prince of a great Spirit, to subdue, and break the hearts of his own Subjects, with whom he should live properly as a Shepherd with his Flock? If two Lovers, who should pass their time in renewing, repeating, and returning all the Offices of Friend∣ship, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> kindness, tenderness, and love, were, instead of that, unluckily contriving always to cross, oppose, and torment one another, what could be the effect of such a Conversation, but Vexation and An∣guish in the beginning, a short lived Correspondence, and Hatred and Contempt in the Conclusion?</P>
<P>Our Constitution is the main Point ever to be regarded; which, God be praised, hath been preserved through so many Ages. For tho' there have been some Men often found, and of great parts too, who, for their private advantages, are aiding, sometimes the Mo∣narch, and sometimes the Party that would be a Common-wealth, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> under specious Pretences for the Publick Good, to exceed the Li∣mits the Constitution hath prescribed in this Country; yet the Na∣tion still finds, in all Ages, some truly Publick Spirits, that pre∣serve it from being long imposed upon. There is a craft and a per∣petual subtilty, that Men of private interest must work with to support their own designs: But the true Interest of the Kingdom is the plainest thing in the world: It is what every Body in <HI>England</HI>
<PB N="VIII" REF="130"/>
finds and feels, and knows to be Right, and they are not long a finding it neither. This is that Interest, that is supported <HI>Non tam fama, quam sua vi;</HI> it's own weight still keeps it steddy against all the Storms, that can be brought to beat upon it, either from the Ignorance of Strangers to our Constitution, or the Violence of any, that project to themselves wild Notions of appealing to the People out of Parliament (a Parliament sitting) as it were to a fourth Estate of the Realm; and calling upon them to come and take their share in the direction of the publick, and most important Consultations. This We conceive to be another way of under∣mining <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the ancient and true Constitution, but not like to be more effectual than some others, that have been tried before; since We have the experience that no violence, nor almost ruin, hath, hitherto, hinder'd it from settling again upon it's old foundation.</P>
<P>There hath been, within the compass of few years, much Talk, and, God knows, too many ill Effects too, of Factions in this King∣dom; and We have lived, in our days, to see the two great Par∣ties, of late known by the Names of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> directly change their ground; and those, who were formerly the Anti-Courtiers, become as pliant and obsequious, as ever They were, who <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> had been the most found fault with on that score. But We are humbly of opinion, that, at this time of day, neither of those Par∣ties have the Game in their hands, as they have formerly perhaps fancied to themselves. But they, who shall be so honest, and so wise, constantly to prefer the true Interest of <HI>England</HI> to that of any other Country or People, preserve the Religion and the Laws, protect and promote the Trade of the Nation, thriftily and provi∣dently administer the publick Treasure, and study to maintain the Soveraignty of our Seas, so naturally, so anciently, and so justly the true defence of this Kingdom; that Body, whomsoever it shall <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> be composed of, shall have the Weight of <HI>England</HI> on it's side; and if there can be any of another frame, they must, in the end, prove so many miserable rotten Reeds.</P>
<P>Well may other Princes, and States, whose Situation requires it for their own Security, find it their Interest, for the preserva∣tion of their Credit and Reputation amongst their Neighbours, to
<PB N="IX" REF="140"/>
keep constantly in pay great Numbers of Land Forces; in which they are still vying one with the other, and boasting who can raise his Thousands, and who his ten Thousands: but they will be found but young States-men for Our Government, who can think it ad∣viseable, that the Strength of this Island should be measured by Proportions so unsuitable to it's true Glory, and Greatness. As well might <HI>David</HI> have thought it requisite, when he was to en∣counter the great Giant of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> that He likewise must have had a Staff to his Spear like a Weavers Beam. But that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Man after Gods own heart</HI> thought it more expedient to his ad∣vantage over the Enemy, he was to contend with, to come against him with Armes that he had tried, and that he could weild. When <HI>Saul</HI> arm'd him with his own Armour, <HI>and put an Helmet of Brass on his head, and arm'd him with a Coat of Mail,</HI> David himself says, <HI>He could not go with these, for he had not proved them.</HI> Which makes us a little reflect on the cir∣cumstances of our own Nation, That, whereas the Fleet of <HI>England</HI> hath been renown'd, through so many Ages, for the ho∣nour and security of this Kingdom, in these latter days, by an un∣accountable <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> improvidence, our care has been more industriously ap∣plied to the raising great Numbers of Land Forces, than in main∣taining, and supporting the glorious ancient Bulwarks of our Coun∣try; and when We have to do with an Enemy, whom We so far excel in strength at Sea, that, with a little more than ordinary application, We might hope to restrain his exorbitant power by our Naval Expeditions, We have imploied our greatest industry, and a vast Expence, to attack him by Land in that part, where, by the strength of his numerous Garrisons, he must be, for many years, at least, invulnerable.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> But it is to be hoped the Great Allies themselves, to whom, We doubt not, the English Nation wishes all happiness and prospe∣rity, as being bound up with them in the same Interest, will at last be sensible, that this Kingdom cannot be useful to the Com∣mon Cause in any other way, so much as at <HI>Sea.</HI> The Situation of this Country adapts it for Advantages by <HI>Sea:</HI> The Trade of it enables it to go on with a War by <HI>Sea:</HI> And neither of them
<PB N="X" REF="150"/>
can long bear a great Expence of a War in a Forreign Land: The experience of former Successes at <HI>Sea</HI> makes the Nation ever fond of imploying it's Vigour <HI>there:</HI> and the perpetual jealousy that, some time or other, Endeavours may be used, by the encrease of Land Forces, to advance another Greatness, and another In∣terest, will fix the genius of the Nation still to depend on it's Great∣ness, and it's Security by <HI>Sea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Suadere Principi quod oporteat, magni laboris; assen∣tatio erga Principem quemcunque sine affectu peragitur,</HI> was a saying of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and one of those that is perpetually ve∣rified. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> For We see, in all times, how Compliance and Flattery gets the better of honesty, and plain dealing. All Men indeed love best those that dispute not with them; a misfortune, whilst it is amongst private Persons, that is not so much taken notice of; but it becomes remarkable, and grows a publick Calamity, when this uncomely obsequiousness is practiced towards great Princes, who are apt to mistake it for Duty, and to prefer it before such Advice as is really good for their Service; at least till the folly, and vanity of such proceedings comes to be seen through; and then the reward of their unseasonable Courtship frequently overtakes the miserable <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Authors, tho' the discovery come too late to preserve from ruin the Master, who hath been deluded.</P>
<P>An Eminent Poet of our own Nation calls this Flattery the food of Fools; and yet it is a plant so guarded and fenced about, so cherished and preserved in all Courts, that it never fails of bringing forth much wretched fruit; and will ever do so, till God Almighty shall send such a discerning Spirit into the hearts of Princes, as may enable them to distinguish between those, that serve to obtain their own ends, and those, who have only in their View the true Interest, and Honour of their Masters; and to punish, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> instead of encouraging, those bold Corrupters of all right Judgement, Justice, Honesty, and Truth.</P>
<P>If at any time it might be hoped this dangerous generation of Men should be discountenanced, one might be allowed to look for it in an Age, when a Revolution hath been thought necessary to make a Reformation: For where the Foundations of the Earth
<PB N="XI" REF="160"/>
were taken to be out of Course, more steddiness, a stricter Virtue, and a more unblameable Administration will be expected to come in the Room of it.</P>
<P>If Princes would bear it, it would be an Advantage to Them, as well as Happiness to their Subjects, to hear plain and bold Truths, when delivered with Duty and Decency and Privacy, from their faithful Servants, in their own life time; whilst they might yet redress, and correct any mistakes of their Judgement, or Will. But because they generally defend themselves from those <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Approaches by their Greatness, and the Awe they usually strike on those that come near them, the next best way to incline them to re∣flect duly upon themselves, is to get them to read the Memorials of Times past: Where They will see how those, who have once go∣vern'd the World, are treated, when they are dead and gone; and that it is the Priviledge, and Practice of all present Ages, to speak without restraint of those that are past: As, We may be confident, the next that comes after this We live in, will not forget to put their Stamp, and their Censure, on what they shall judge good, or bad, in any part of it. And this truth will be allowed in all times, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that a great King, who is known to govern in his own Person, who is not managed by his Ministers, but does Himself give the direction, the life, and determination to all his Commands, as he ought to have the Glory, and the Merit of his Conduct and Skill, brought to his own Account without a Rival, so he will have the misfortune of having the errors of his Reign, if any there be, imputed likewise to Himself.</P>
<P>We have been led, from one step to another, farther than the scope of a Preface to this History might properly have drawn Us, were it not that the observation of the miscarriages in former <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> times, continued down by degrees, as we conceive, from the like mistake, and the like root of animosity and discontent, had engaged us to make some remarks on the most eminent of them, and to lay them together in one view, for every Man's calm Judgement and Animadversion, as the best means, in our opinion, to prevent any such for the future. Which makes Us hope the Reader will not be of∣fended with some Excursions, upon publishing such a Work, that
<PB N="XII" REF="170"/>
hath so much of Information and Instruction in it, that it must fur∣nish to every one great variety of Reflections; and, amongst others, the observation of this particular, and almost continual Misfortune to all Princes, who are apt to think that, out of the great Num∣bers of their Subjects, and the Crowd of their Courtiers and Flat∣terers, they can never want a supply of just and faithful Servants; which makes them so little value, and so often throw away their best and ablest Ministers; whereas there is in truth nothing so diffi∣cult for a Prince, as to find a good, honest, just, well temper'd, and impartial Servant; and it is almost impossible to preserve him long. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> For whosoever comes to the Yoke of true painful drudgery in his Masters Service, from that moment creates to himself so many in∣dustrious Enemies, as he cannot gratify in all their several wild pretensions, to displace and destroy him. So that such a Man's Sta∣tion must be extreme slippery, and his favour oftentimes short lived, whose whole time being taken up in promoting the solid greatness of his Master, and the good of his Country, he cannot have lei∣sure to take care of Himself. For whilst he is watching the Ene∣mies of the State, and laying Foundations for the happiness of fu∣ture Times, as well as for the security of the present, and looking <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> after all the Parts of the Administration; that the Religion of the Land may be reverenced; the Justice of the Nation Unblemished; the Revenues of the Crown carefully and honestly collected, and distributed with an equal hand of generosity and good husbandry, according to the several occasions that may require either; How can such a Minister be watching the secret Machinations of the Envyers, and Underminers of his Credit and Honesty? And therefore he may be forgiven, if, being conscious to himself of his own Integrity towards the Publick, he contemns the little Arts of ill designing Men; by which however, from the first hour of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> his entering into the Service of his Master, he is continually pur∣sued, till he is at length hunted down, and unavoidably destroyed at Court.</P>
<P>We do not intend here to write the particulars of the Life of this Author; but We may say in short, that such a Figure as is here described of a great and Superiour Minister, and, in some
<PB N="XIII" REF="180"/>
degree, of a Favourite too, this excellent Man made, for about two years after the Restoration of the King his Master, who, during that time, relied entirely on his Advice, and Conduct. There were indeed some other Great and Wise Men, whom the King, for some considerable time, consulted in his weightiest Affairs. There was the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> then Lord High Trea∣surer of <HI>England,</HI> with whom our Author had always an entire and fast Friendship, and whom all Men, that knew him, honour'd for his great Abilities, and eminent Integrity. There was the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> then Lord General, who had the honour, and good Fortune of bringing most things, and Men at that time to bear together, for the Restoration of that King, and the Royal Family to the Seat of their Ancestors. There was the then Mar∣quis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> soon after his Majesty's Return made Lord Steward of the House-hold, and Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> who had, not only followed, but even graced his Masters Fortunes, in all the time of his Exile, with the Attendance of so eminent, and meritorious a Subject; who had often ventured his Person, and lost all his Large Estate in the steady pursuit of Loyalty and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Duty to the Crown, and Zeal for the true Religion. There was the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who had, when Admiral, and General at Sea, to his share the glorious part of bringing the Fleet of <HI>England,</HI> and the Body of the English Sea-men, to concur in the King's Re∣storation; and had, before that time, been very meritorious to∣wards his Majesty, as is mention'd at large in the ensuing parts of this History. These were the principal; and besides these, there was one more, who, tho' in a different rank, was admitted, at that time, into the most intimate Trust and Confidence, Old Se∣cretary <HI>Nicholas;</HI> who had served his two Masters, King <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Charles</HI> the first and second, with so much Faithfulness and Integrity, as to be justly entitled to a part in the most important Administration. But, without the least design of detracting from the Credit or Interest of these great, and honourable Persons, We may truly say, our Author had the preference of them all in the King's Favour and Esteem; and by his prudence, knowledge, and experience, in which he shared with the others, and his
<PB N="XIV" REF="190"/>
Indefatigable Labour and Pains, wherein, it is most certain, they did not share with Him, he had the Happiness, without their Envy, and with their Concurrence, to have the greatest share in disposing the minds of the People, and the King too, to agree then on such measures in Parliament, as laid the foundation of that Peace, Plenty, and Prosperity this Nation hath enjoyed since.</P>
<P>He had the happiness to have the greatest share in preserving the Constitution of our Government entire, when the Then pre∣sent Temper of the People, was but too ready to have gone into <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> any undue complyance with the Crown.</P>
<P>He had the happiness, amongst several other good Acts of Par∣liament, to have the greatest share in compassing and perfecting the Act of Oblivion, and Indemnity; the Act for confirming Judi∣cial Proceedings; and the Act of Uniformity; by which the Peo∣ple of <HI>England</HI> were quieted in their Minds, and settled in their Possessions; and the Church of <HI>England</HI> redeem▪d from the op∣pressions it had lain under, and established and set up by the Law of the Land, as it was also by our blessed Saviours promise to all those, that serve him in Holiness and Truth, on that Rock, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> against which the Gates of Hell were not to prevail. This is that Church, which desires to have her Doctrine understood, as well as obeyed; and which depends on the Infallibility of Scripture for her Guide, but never could be drawn to allow it to any Mor∣tal Men, whether in a single Person, or a greater Number; and which, of all the Churches in the World, does most rational∣ly inform her Members in the Practice of pure Religion and un∣defiled towards God, with Decency in Worship, without Af∣fectation, Superstition, or Ostentation; and Obedience to the King, with due Regard to the Constitution, and the Laws of the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Land. By Gods blessing on these means, our Author had the hap∣piness to leave lasting Monuments of his Judgement, and his Pie∣ty; of his Loyalty to his Prince; and his entire Love to his Country.</P>
<P>It was during the Ministry of this Person, and whilst he was in his greatest Credit, that memorable Expression was used, in one of
<PB N="XV" REF="200"/>
King <HI>Charles</HI> the seconds Speeches to both Houses: That in all his Deliberations and Actions, his principal Consideration should be, What will a Parliament think of them?</P>
<P>Every Body then knew, by whose Advice that King was in∣clined to make that wise Declaration. And certainly it had been happy for him, if he had always practised it; and all <HI>England</HI> hath Reason to wish, that all Ministers had continued, to this day, to give the like wholesome Counsel.
<Q><L>Hae tibi erunt Artes,</L></Q>
<MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> said our Author, to a King of <HI>England:</HI> Keep always well with your Parliaments. Let no vain whimsey of the Example of other Countries, but utterly impracticable in This, delude you. Keep always in the true Interest of the Nation; and a King of <HI>England</HI> is the greatest, and happiest Prince in the World.</P>
<P>How this Person came first to lessen in his Credit, and after∣wards, in the space of about five years, to fall quite out of that Kings favour, to be Disgraced, as the Language at Court is, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and Banished, must be a little touched; and We shall make an end. They who were then most concern'd in his Misfortunes, and felt the most sensible strokes of his Majesty's displeasure in their Family, have it not in their hearts to lay any thing hard at the Door of that King, once a most gracious, and indulgent Master to our Author, and who was certainly not of a Dispo∣sition to do harsh things to any Body; and who, as We have Rea∣son to believe, out of the sense of unkind Usage to the Father, did afterwards, by his own singular goodness and favour, much against the mind of some in Credit with him, draw his two Sons, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> who yet Survive, into a very great degree of Trust, and Confi∣dence near him; and particularly bestowed on the second, ex∣traordinary marks of Honour and Bounty, that are to descend to his Posterity.</P>
<P>We take them both to be men of so much Piety to their Father, and so much Spirit in themselves, that they would, by no means, be bribed to omit any thing upon this occasion, that might be of Use or
<PB N="XVI" REF="210"/>
Advantage to the honour of one they owe so much Duty to; if they could conceive, that there was need, at this time of day, to contri∣bute to the Justification of his Innocency. The world hath lasted long enough, since the Misfortunes of this honourable Person, to be throughly convinced, that there was nothing in all those Ar∣ticles exhibited against him in Parliament, that did in the least touch or concern him. One of his Sons, then of the House of Commons, offer'd in that House, that if they, who accused him, would but take the Pains to prove to the House any one of the Articles, and take which they would, if they made out but any <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> one of them all, Himself, and all his Friends, would acknowledge him guilty of all.</P>
<P>But there is no need now of the vindication of such a Man, whom every Body, in their consciences, do not only acquit of any crime, but all Good Men speak of with honour; and who still lives in the opinion of all true English Men, in as high a Repu∣tation as any Man to this day.</P>
<P>Yet, altho' We intend to decline all manner of Reflection on the Memory of that King, We may be allow'd to say, That that ex∣cellently well natured Prince, who did very few ill natured things <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in his Reign, was prevailed upon, in this case, not only to put out of his Service one of the most Faithful and Ancient Servants then alive to his Father, or Himself (which is not to be so much com∣plain'd of; for it would be a hard Tie indeed for a Prince to be, as it were, Married to his Servants for better, for worse) but to consent to an Act of Parliament, that obliged this his poor Servant to end his days in Banishment, with old Age and Infirmities to attend him: This might be thought a little hard-hearted to inflict upon a Man, who had the honour and happiness, in the more vi∣gorous part of his Life, to have led the King himself through his <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> own Exile, with Credit and Dignity, and in more Honour and Reputation, than usually attends Unfortunate Princes, that are deprived of their own Dominions; and at last, in the fulness of Gods own Time, had the happiness to have so considerable ashare in the Conduct of his Restoration. For it was by this Author principally, that the continual correspondence was kept up with
<PB N="XVII" REF="220"/>
the Loyal Party in <HI>England,</HI> in order to cultivate good thoughts of his Majesty in the minds of his People, and to bring them, in some sort, acquainted with his Temper and Disposition, before they could know his Person. This Author likewise framed, disposed, and drew those Letters and Declarations from <HI>Breda,</HI> which had so wonderful an Effect all over <HI>England,</HI> and were so generally approved here, that they were, almost all, turn'd into Acts of Parliament.</P>
<P>Many perhaps may not unreasonably believe, that the Mar∣riage <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of the then Duke of <HI>York</HI> with the Daughter of this Author might have been one great occasion, if not the Founda∣tion of his Fall; and tho' it be most undoubtedly true, that this very unequal Allyance was brought to pass entirely without the knowledge, or Privity of this Author, but so much the contrary, that when the King, at that time, made him more than ordi∣nary expressions of his Grace to him, with Assurances that this Accident should not lessen the Esteem, and Favour his Majesty had for him; yet his own good Judgement made him immediate∣ly sensible, and declare it too, to those he was intimate with, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that this must certainly be the occasion of the diminution of his Credit.</P>
<P>The continual dropping of Water does not more infallibly make an hollow in a Stone, than the perpetual Whispers of ill Men must make impression in the heart of any Prince, that will al∣ways lie open to hear them; nor can any Man's mind be suf∣ficiently guarded from the influence of continued Calumny, and Back-biting.</P>
<P>When the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had made this Marriage, it was not unnatural to those ill minded Men to suggest, that, for the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> time to come, that Minister would be contriving Advantages for the good of his own Posterity, to the prejudice of his Soveraign, and Master. What their wickedness, possibly, would have allow'd Them to practice, was ground enough to them for an Accusation of His Innocency.</P>
<P>It was true that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> was become the Chan∣cellor's Son in Law; and therefore they hoped to be believed,
<PB N="XVIII" REF="230"/>
when they said, that to satisfy his Ambition, he would forfeit his Integrity; which, God knows, was Not true.</P>
<P>Thus what <HI>Tacitus</HI> observes in the time of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> of <HI>Granius Marcellus,</HI> who was inform'd against to have spoken ill words of that Emperour, was here, in some sort, verified on our Author:</P>
<P>Inevitabile crimen, <HI>says</HI> Tacitus <HI>concerning those words,</HI> nam, quia vera erant, etiam dicta credebantur.</P>
<P>The Allyance was undeniable; there were Children born of it; and the King was not blessed with any from his Marriage. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> An inevitable crime laid on our Author. For, because it was true, that there were Children from one Marriage, and not from the other, it was suggested, that both Marriages had been so con∣trived by the Chancellor: tho' the King knew very well, that his own Marriage had not been first projected, or proposed by this Author; and that he had often told his Majesty, what suspicions there were in the world, that that great and virtuous Princess might prove unfruitful.</P>
<P>Another inevitable Misfortune, which was then laid as a Crime too on our Author, was a Report very falsely, but very <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> industriously spread abroad, that first begat a Coldness, and, by degrees, very much disinclined a great many of the Royal Party to him; a Report, that he should have instilled into the King's mind a Principle, that he must prefer his Enemies, and advance Them, to gain them to be his Friends; and for his Old Friends, it was no matter how he used Them, for They would be so still. To which very scandalous misrepresentation We must give this true Answer:</P>
<P>It fell out indeed, that every Man's Expectation, that had laboured all the heat of the day in the Vine-yard, who had re∣ceived <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> wounds in their Persons in the day of Battle, or suffer'd in their Fortunes or Liberties, for the preservation of a good conscience during the Usurpation of Tyranny and Anarchy, was not, and, alas! could not, be recompenced immediately according to their Merit, or the Hopes they had entertained: And be∣cause it was true that they were disappointed, it was believed
<PB N="XIX" REF="240"/>
by some of them, that our Author, being Minister at that time, had instilled this damnable Doctrine and Position, that it was no matter how the King used his Old Friends: and because it was true that they were not considered as they deserved, it must be believed, as they would have it, that He was the Author of that Advice.</P>
<P>It was true that the King, who was so wonderfully restored with all that Glory and Peace, more perhaps upon the confi∣dence of his Declarations and Promises from <HI>Breda,</HI> than any <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> other Humane means, and who had thought it necessary to re∣commend, in his most gracious Speech to both Houses, upon the passing the Act of Indemnity, that all marks of distinction and division amongst his Subjects, should be for ever buried and for∣gotten, did not think it for his Honour, and true Interest, to Reign over a Party only of his Subjects; and therefore, imme∣diately after his Restoration, in order to the Settlement of his Court, and Family, the then Earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> whose part every body remember'd to have been very eminent, in the time of the Rebellion, against King <HI>Charles</HI> the first, but who had in∣dustriously <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> applied himself several years to the King, to make re∣paration for his former Errors, and had been considerably ser∣viceable to him in several occasions, was honoured with the Of∣fice of Lord Chamberlain of the House-hold; to let the King∣dom see, how the King Himself began with practising what he exhorted his Subjects to, that admirable Art of Forgetful∣ness, when he put Such a person into so eminent a Station in the Government, near his own Person. And it was certainly of Advantage to the King, in the beginning of his settlement here, as well as a Mark of Justice in his Nature, to let his <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Subjects know and feel, that every one of them might capaci∣tate himself, by his future behaviour, for any Dignity and Pre∣ferment.</P>
<P>But it could never be in the Heart of a Man, who had been all along on the suffering side, to do his own Party so base an Office with the King, as this false Report did insinuate. He might be of opinion that the fatted Calf was to be killed, for the
<PB N="XX" REF="250"/>
entertainment of the Prodigal Son, whenever he returned; that there might be no distinction of Parties kept up among<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Us; but he could never forget the Birthright of the Eldest Son, who had served the King so many years, and had not at any time transgressed his commandment, and so well deserved that praise, and that reward, <HI>Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</HI> And yet this Calumny, false as it was, was another inevitable Crime, or at least Misfortune. For without that opinion, which some of the Royal Party had sucked in, that the Chancellor had abandon'd their Interest, it had been impossi∣ble <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to have engaged a Majority in that Parliament, to have con∣sented to that Act of Banishment.</P>
<P>God forgive the Inventors and Contrivers of that foul Ca∣lumny: But, by his Almighty Providence, who from Heaven re∣veals Secrets, it was not long before that Party was disabused. For, tho' the Chancellor, for some time, bore the blame, that they had not been more considered, it was quickly found, that it was not from Him, but from the mistaken Politicks of the new States∣men, that they were design'd to be neglected. Nor did they at all find themselves more taken notice of, after his Removal; nor have <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the several other Parties in the Kingdom, that have been che∣rished, and countenanced in opposition to this, much declined, as We conceive, to this day.</P>
<P>But after all, We are humbly of opinion, that it was neither of these above mention'd unavoidable Misfortunes, nor both toge∣ther, that gave the fatal, and last decisive blow to the fortune of this good Man. The King had too good a Judgement, and was too well natured, to have been imposed upon barely by such Attacks as these; which he knew very well himself, as to our Authors guilt in them, were Frivolous and Unjust. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>But there are always in Courts secret Engines, that Actually consummate the Mischiefs, that others, in a more publick way, have been long in bringing to pass: And in this case there were two principal ones:</P>
<P>The One, the Interest of some of the Zealots of the Popish Par∣ty, who knew this Minister had too much Credit in the Nation, tho'
<PB N="XXI" REF="260"/>
he should lose it with the King, to suffer the Projects, they perpe∣tually had, of propagating their Religion, to take effect, whilst he should be in the Kingdom:</P>
<P>The Other, the Faction of the Ladys, too prevalent at that time with the King, who were afraid of such a Mans being near him, as durst talk to him, as he had several times taken the Li∣berty to do, of the scandal of their lives, and reprove both the Master and the Mistresses, for their publick unlawful Con∣versations.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Thus these two Interests, joyning their Forces, were so power∣ful, that there was no resisting them, by a Man, who could not make Court to Either. And so he fell a Sacrifice to the Ambi∣tion, and Malice of all sorts of Enemies, who were desirous of getting new places to themselves in the Court, and of trying new Inventions in the State.</P>
<P>And yet it is to be observed, that that King, who was, almost all his Reign, ever labouring, with much pains to get a little Ease, which he might perhaps have attained with less trouble, and, no doubt, hoped, by getting rid of this old importunate Coun∣sellor, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to terrify any Man from presuming afterwards to tell him such bold Truths, had scarce ever after any Serenity in his whole Reign: But those very Women, or others in their places, and the Factions he himself had given countenance to, grew too hard for him, and tore him almost to pieces, sometimes in the favouring of one Party, and sometimes of another, without steady∣ness of his own, or confidence enough in any of his Servants, to guide him through those perplexities, that could not have been brought upon him, but by his own consent.</P>
<P>We dare say, there were some hours in his life, that he wish'd <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> he had had his old Chancellor again; who, he knew, was a more skilful Pilot than any of his new Sates-men;
<Q><L>(Tempus erit, magno cum optaverit emptum Intactum)</L></Q></P>
<P>And that he had not, by his too much eagerness to get rid of one old Servant, given too great an handle to have new Measures,
<PB N="XXII" REF="270"/>
and new Counsels, so often imposed upon him, throughout the whole remaining part of his life.</P>
<P>Thus We have finished our Preface, which We thought in∣cumbent on us to make, who had lived to be acquainted with this Author, and to have known his merit, that it might at∣tend the publishing this History, to give the present Age some in∣formation of the Character of him, they are to read. And as we desired to perform it with respect to his Memory, so, We hope, We have not exceeded the bounds of truth, and modesty, which he him∣self would have taken unkindly from those, that are doing this <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Office to him. Whatever Misfortunes he might have in his life; whatever Enemies he might have had; or whatever Errors he might have committed (which few Men in his high Stations escape quite clear of) We presume to think he deserves, from all im∣partial Men, the praise of an honest, just, and able Servant to the Church and Crown, and to be ranked amongst the great and good Ministers of State.</P>
<P><HI>And now We will conclude all, with a thanksgiving to God in Saint</HI> Luke, Glory be to God on high, and on Earth peace, good will, towards Men. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>For Gods name ought ever to be glorified in all his dispensa∣tions; whether they be attended with the Prosperities, or Ad∣versities of this present World. We speak it knowingly, that our Noble Author did so throughout the Course of his Misfortunes, and that he did adore, and magnify Gods holy Name, for all his Mercies so plentifully bestowed upon him; and particularly for giving him the Courage, and Virtue, constantly to act and suffer honourably through all the considerable Emploiments of his life; and, more especially, to endeavour to keep things even between the King and the People (the everlasting labour of a faithful Ser∣vant) <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> rather than advance his own favour, by unreasonably ad∣vancing the Prerogative on the one hand, or his credit, by court∣ing the Popular Interest, on the other; which We heartily wish, all Men, in the highest Authority under a King of <HI>England,</HI> may ever remember to practice.</P>
<P>And whoever are acquainted with the Sons of this Noble
<PB N="XXIII" REF="280"/>
Author, must do them this justice to own, they have often de∣clared, that they have found themselves as well the better Chri∣stians, as the better Men, for the afflicted, as well as prosperous parts of their Fathers Life; which hath taught them, to be the less surprised with the various turns, they have met with in the Course of their own. With Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> they <HI>have learnt to know how to be exalted, and how to be abased.</HI> This as Christians: And with <HI>Horace,</HI> who attributes more to Fortune, they have learnt to have always in their minds,
<MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <Q><L>Laudo manentem, si celeres quatit</L>
<L>Pennas, Resigno quae dedit.</L></Q></P>
<P>And having thus glorified God on high, that they may do all in them lies, towards promoting Peace on Earth, they do very heartily declare, and profess good Will towards all Men; and bear no unkindness to any, that were the Contrivers of the unde∣served Misfortunes of their Noble Father.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Preface</HI> of the Author.</NOTE> <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT Posterity may not be Deceived by the prosperous Wickedness of those times of which I write, into an Opinion, that nothing less than a general Combination, and universal Apo∣stacy in the whole Nation from their Religion, and Allegiance, could, in so short a time, have produced such a total and prodigious Altera∣tion, and Confusion over the whole Kingdom; And that the Memory of those, who, out of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Duty and Conscience, have opposed that Tor∣rent, which did overwhelm them, may not loose the recompence due to their Virtue, but having undergone the injuries and reproaches of This, may find a vindication in a better age: It will not be unuseful, for the information of the Judgement and Conscience of men, to present to the world a full and clear Narration of the Grounds, Circumstances, and Ar∣tifices of this Rebellion; not only from the time since the flame hath been visible in a Civil war, but, looking farther back, from those former passages and accidents, by which the Seed-plots were made and framed, from whence those mischiefs have successively grown to the height, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> they have since arrived at.</P>
<P>AND in this ensuing History, though the hand and judgement of God will be very visible, in infatuating a People (as ripe and prepared for Destruction) into all the perverse actions of folly and madness, making
<PB N="4" REF="310"/>
the Weak to contribute to the designs of the Wicked, and suffering even those, by degrees, out of a conscience of their guilt, to grow more wicked than they intended to be; letting the Wise to be imposed upon by men of small understanding; and permitting the Innocent to be possessed with laziness and sleep in the most visible article of danger; uniting the Ill, though of the most different opinions, opposite interests, and distant affections, in a firm and constant league of Mischeifs; and dividing those, whose opinions and interests are the same, into Faction and Emulation, more pernicious to the publick than the Treason of the others: whilst the poor People, under pretence of Zeal to Religion, Law, Liberty, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Parliaments (words of pretious esteem in their just signification) are fu∣riously hurried into actions introducing Atheism, and dissolving all the Elements of Christian Religion; cancelling all obligations, and destroy∣ing all foundations of Law and Liberty; and rendring, not only the Privileges, but the very Being of Parliaments desperate and impractica∣ble: I say, though the immediate finger and wrath of God must be ac∣knowledged in these perplexities and distractions; yet he who shall dili∣gently observe the distempers and conjunctures of Time, the ambition, pride and folly of Persons, and the suddain growth of Wickedness, from want of care and circumspection in the first impressions, will find all <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> these miseries to have proceeded, and to have been brought upon us from the same natural causes, and means, which have usually attended King∣doms swoln with long plenty, pride, and excess, towards some signal mortification, and castigation of Heaven. And it may be, upon the con∣sideration how impossible it was to foresee many things that have hap∣pen'd, and of the necessity of overlooking many other things, we may not yet find the cure so desperate, but that, by Gods mercy, the wounds may be again bound up; and then this prospect may not make the future Peace less pleasant and durable.</P>
<P>I HAVE the more willingly induced my self to this unequal task, out <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of the hope of contributing somewhat to that blessed end: and though a peice of this nature (wherein the infirmities of some, and the malice of others must be boldly look'd upon and mention'd) is not likely to be published in the age, in which it is writ, yet it may serve to inform my self, and some others, what we ought to do, as well as to comfort us in what we have done. For which work, as I may not be thought altoge∣ther an incompetent person, having been present as a Member of Parlia∣ment in those Councils before, and till the breaking out of the Rebellion, and having since had the Honour to be near two great Kings in some Trust, so I shall perform the same with all faithfulness, and ingenuity; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> with an equal observation of the faults and infirmities of both sides, with their defects and over<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ights in pursuing their own ends; and shall no otherwise mention small and light Occurrences, than as they have been Introductions to matters of the greatest Moment, nor speak of Persons otherwise, than as the mention of their Virtues or Vices is essential to the work in hand: In which I shall, with truth, preserve my self from the least sharpness, that may proceed from private provocation, and in the whole, observe the rules, that a man should, who deserves to be beleived.</P>
<P>I SHALL not then lead any man farther back in this journey for the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> discovery of the entrance into those dark ways, than the beginning of this Kings reign. For I am not so sharp-sighted as those, who have discerned this Rebellion contriving, from (if not before) the death of

Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and fomented by several Princes, and great Ministers of State in <HI>Christendom,</HI> to the time that it brake out. Neither do I look so far back as I do, because I believe the design to have been so long since formed, but that by viewing the Temper, Disposition, and Habit at that time of the Court and of the Country, we may discern the minds of men prepared, of some to Act, and of others to Suffer all that hath since happened; the Pride of this man, and the Popularity of that; the Le∣vity of one, and the Morosity of another; the Excess of the Court in the greatest Want, and the Parsimony and Retention of the Country <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> in the greatest Plenty; the spirit of Craft and Subtility in some, and the Unpolished Integrity of others, too much despising craft or art; all con∣tributing joyntly to this mass of Confusion now before us.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A View of the beginning of K. <HI>Charles I</HI> his Reign.</NOTE> <SEG REND="decorInit">K</SEG>ING <HI>James</HI> in the end of March 1625 died, leaving his Majesty that now is, engaged in a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> but unprovided with money to manage it; though it was undertaken by the consent and advice of Parlia∣ment: the People being naturally enough inclined to the War (having surfeited with the uninterrupted plea∣sures and plenty of 22 years Peace) and sufficiently inflamed against the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Spaniard; but quickly weary of the charge of it: And therefore, after an unprosperous and chargeable attempt in a voyage by Sea upon <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and as unsuccessfull, and more unfortunate one upon <HI>France</HI> at the Isle of <HI>Ree</HI> (for some difference had likewise about the same time begotten a War with that Prince) a general Peace was shortly concluded with both Kingdoms; the Exchequer being so exhausted with the debts of King <HI>James,</HI> the bounty of his Majesty that now is (who upon his first access to the Crown gave many costly instances of his favour to persons near him) and the charge of the War upon <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> that both the known, and casual Revenue being anticipated, the necessary Subsi∣stence <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of the household was unprovided for; and the King on the suddain driven to those streights for his own Support, that many ways were re∣sorted to, and inconveniencies submitted to for Supply; as selling the Crown-Lands, creating Peers for money, and many other particulars, which no access of power, or plenty since could repair.</P>
<P>PARLIAMENTS were Summoned, and again Dissolved in displeasure: and that in the fourth year (after the dissolution of the two former) was determined with a Profession, and Declaration, that, <Q>“”since for several ill ends the calling again of a Parliament was divulged, however his Majesty had shewed, by his frequent meeting with his People, his love <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to the use of Parliaments, yet the late abuse having, for the present, driven his Majesty unwillingly out of that course, he shall account it presumption for any to prescribe any time to his Majesty for Parlia∣ments.</Q> Which words were generally interpreted, as if no more Assem∣blies of that nature were to be expected, and that all men were prohi∣bited upon the penalty of censure, so much as to speak of a Parliament. And here I cannot but let my self loose to say, that no man can shew me a Source, from whence those waters of bitterness, we now taste, have more probably flowed, than from these unreasonable, unskilful, and precipitate Dissolutions of Parliaments; in which, by an unjust survey <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of the Passion, Insolence, and Ambition of particular persons, the Court measured the Temper and Affection of the Country; and by the same
<PB N="6" REF="330"/>
standard the People consider'd the Honour, Justice, and Piety of the Court; and so usually parted, at those sad seasons, with no other respect, and charity one toward the other, than accompanies persons who never meant to meet but in their own defence. In which the King had always the disadvantage to harbour Persons about him, who with their utmost Industry, false Information, and Malice, improved the faults, and in∣firmities of the Court to the People; and again, as much as in them lay, rendered the People suspected if not odious to the King.</P>
<P>I AM not alltogether a stranger to the passages of those Parliaments (though I was not a Member of them) having carefully perused the Jour∣nals <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of both Houses, and familiarly conversed with many, who had prin∣cipal parts in them. And I cannot but wonder at those Counsels, which perswaded the courses then taken; the habit and temper of mens minds, at that time, being, no question, very applicable to the Publick ends; and those ends being only discredited by the Jealousies, the People entertain'd from the manner of the prosecution, that they were other, and worse than in truth they were. It is not to be denied, that there were, in all those Parliaments, especially in that of the fourth year, several Passages, and distempered Speeches of particular persons, not fit for the dignity, and honour of those places, and unsuitable to the Reverence due to his <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Majesty and his Councils. But I do not know any formed Act of either House (for neither the Remonstrance, nor Votes of the last day were such) that was not agreeable to the Wisdome, and Justice of great Courts upon those extraordinary occasions. And whoever considers the Acts of power, and injustice of some of the Ministers, in those intervals of Parliament, will not be much scandalized at the warmth, and vivacity of those meetings.</P>
<P>IN the Second Parliament there was a mention, and intention de∣clared of granting five Subsidies, a proportion (how contemptible soever in respect of the pressures now every day imposed) scarce ever before <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> heard of in Parliament. And that Meeting being, upon very unpopular, and unplausible reasons, immediately Dissolved, those five Subsidies were exacted, throughout the whole Kingdom, with the same rigour, as if, in truth, an Act had passed to that purpose: Divers Gentlemen of prime quality, in several Countys of <HI>England,</HI> were, for refusing to pay the same, committed to Prison, with great rigour and extraordinary cir∣cumstances. And could it be imagined, that those men would meet again in a free convention of Parliament, without a sharp, and severe expostulation, and inquisition into their own Right, and the power that had imposed upon that Right? And yet all these Provocations, and many <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> other, allmost of as large an extent, produced no other Resentment than the Petition of Right (of no prejudice to the Crown) which was like∣wise purchased at the price of five Subsidies more, and, in a very short time after that Supply granted, that Parliament was likewise, with strange circumstances of passion on all sides, Dissolved.</P>
<P>THE abrupt, and unkind breaking off the Two first Parliaments was wholely imputed to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> and of the Third princi∣pally to the Lord <HI>Weston,</HI> then Lord high Treasurer of <HI>England;</HI> both in respect of the great power, and interest they then had in the affections of his Majesty, and for that the time of the Dissolutions happened to be <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> when some Charges, and Accusations were preparing, and ready to be preferred against those two great Persons. And therefore the Envy, and Hatred, that attended them thereupon, was Insupportable, and was
<PB N="7" REF="340"/>
visibly the cause of the Murther of the first (stabbed to the heart by the hand of a Villain, upon the meer impious pretence of his being odious to the Parliament) and made, no doubt, so great an impression upon the Understanding, and Nature of the other, that, by degrees, he lost that temper, and serenity of mind, he had been before master of, and which was most fit to have accompanied him in his weighty imployments: in∣somuch, as, out of indignation to find himself worse used than he de∣served, he cared less to deserve well, than he had done; and insensibly grew into that Publick hatred, that render'd him less useful to the Ser∣vice, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> that he only intended.</P>
<P>I WONDER less at the Errors of this nature, in the Duke of <HI>Bucking∣ham;</HI> who, having had a most generous Education in Courts, was utterly Ignorant of the Ebbs, and Floods of Popular Councils, and of the Winds that move those Waters; and could not, without the spirit of Indigna∣tion, find himself, in the space of a few weeks, without any visible cause intervening, from the greatest height of popular Estimation, that any person hath ascended to (insomuch as S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Coke</HI> blasphemously call'd him our Saviour) by the same Breath thrown down to the depth of Calumny, and Reproach. I say, it is no Marvail (besides that he was <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> naturally to follow such Counsels as were given him) that He could think of no better way, to be freed of these inconveniences, and troubles, the Passions of those Meetings gave him, than to Dissolve them, and pre∣vent their coming together: and that when they seemed to neglect the Publick Peace, out of Animosity to him, he intended his own Ease and Security in the first place, and easily beleived, the Publick might be otherwise provided for, by more Intent, and Dispassionate Counsels. But that the other, the Lord <HI>Weston,</HI> who had been very much, and very Popularly conversant in those Conventions, who exactly knew the Frame, and Constitution of the Kingdom, the temper of the People, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Extents of the Courts of Law, and the Jurisdiction of Parliaments, which at that time had seldom, or never committed any Excess of juris∣diction (Modesty and Moderation in Words never was, nor ever will be observed in Popular Councils, whose foundation is Liberty of Speech) that He should beleive, that the Union, Peace, and Plenty of the King∣dom could be preserved without Parliaments, or that the Passion, and Distemper gotten, and received into Parliaments, could be removed, and reformed by the more passionate Breaking and Dissolving them; or that that Course would not inevitably prove the most Pernicious to himself, is as much my Wonder, as any thing that hath since happened.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> THERE is a Protection very gracious, and just, which Princes owe to their Servants, when, in obedience to their just Commands, upon extra∣ordinary and necessary Occasions, in the execution of their Trusts, they swerve from the strict letter of the Law, which, without that Mercy, would be Penal to them. In any such Case, it is as Legal (the Law presuming it will allways be done upon great Reason) for the King to pardon, as for the Party to accuse, and the Judge to condemn. But for the Sove∣raign Power to interpose, and shelter an Accused Servant from answer∣ing, do's not only seem an obstruction of Justice, and lay an imputation upon the Prince of being privy to the Offence, but leaves so great a <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Scandal upon the Party himself, that he is generally concluded Guilty of whatsoever he is charged with; which is commonly more than the Worst man ever deserved. And it is worthy the Observation, that, as no Innocent man, who made his Defence, ever Suffer'd in those times
<PB N="$" REF="350"/>
by Judgement of Parliament, so many Guilty persons, and against whom the Spirit of the times went as high, by the wise managing their Defence, have been Freed from their Accusers, not only without Censure, but without Reproach; as the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> then Lord Keeper, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>H. Marten,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>H. Spiller;</HI> Men, in their several degrees, as little be∣holden to the Charity of that time, as any men since. Whereas scarce a man, who, with Industry and Skill, laboured to keep himself from be∣ing Accused, or by Power to stop or divert the Course of Proceeding, scaped without some Signal Mark of Infamy, or Prejudice. And the Reason is clear, for besides that, after the first Storm, there is some Com∣passion <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> naturally attends Men like to be in Misery; and besides the la∣titude of Judging in those places, whereby there is room for Kindness and Affection, and collateral Considerations to interpose; the truth is, those Accusations (to which this man contributes his Malice, another his Wit, all men what they Please, and most upon Hear-say, with a kind of Uncharitable Delight of making the Charge as Heavy as may be) are commonly stuffed with many odious Generals, that the Proofs seldom make good: and then a man is no sooner found less Guilty than he is ex∣pected, but he is concluded more Innocent than he is; and it is thought but a just Reparation for the Reproach that he deserved not, to Free him <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> from the Censure he deserved. So that, very probably, those two noble Persons had been happy, if they had stoutly submitted to the Proceed∣ings were designed against them; and, without question, it had been of soveraign Use to the King, if, in those Peaceable times, Parliaments had been Taught to know their own Bounds, by being suffer'd to Proceed as far as they could go; by which the Extent of their Power would quick∣ly have been Manifested: from whence no Inconvenience of moment could have Proceeded; the House of Commons never then Pretending to the least part of Judicature, or Exceeding the known verge of their own Privileges; the House of Peers observing the Rules of the Law <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and Equity in their Judgements, and proceeding Deliberately upon clear Testimony and Evidence of matter of fact; and the King retaining the sole power of Pardoning, and receiving the whole profit of all Penalties and Judgements; and indeed having so great an Influence upon the Body of the Peerage, that it was scarce known, that any Person of Ho∣nour was severely Censured in that House (before this present Parlia∣ment) who was not either immediately Prosecuted by the Court, or in evident Disfavour there; by which, it may be (as it usually falls out) some Doors were opened, at which Inconveniencies to the Crown have got in, that were not then enough Weighed and Considered. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>BUT the Course of Exempting Men from Prosecution, by Dissolving of Parliaments, made the power of Parliaments much more Formidable, as conceived to be without Limit; since the Soveraign Power seemed to be compelled (as unable otherwise to set Bounds to their Proceedings) to that rough Cure, and to determine their Beings, because it could not de∣termine their Jurisdiction. Whereas if they had been frequently Sum∣moned, and seasonably Dissolved, after their wisdom in applying Medi∣cines and Cures, as well as their industry in discovering Diseases, had been discerned, they would easily have been applied to the Uses for which they were first Instituted; and been of no less Esteem with the Crown, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> than of Veneration with the People. And so I shall conclude this Di∣gression, which, I conceived, was not unseasonable for this Place nor upon this Occasion, and return to the Time, when that brisk, and improvident
<PB N="9" REF="360"/>
Resolution was taken of declining those Conventions; all men being Inhibited (as I said before they generally took themselves to be) by the Proclamation at the Dissolution of the Parliament in the Fourth year, so much as to mention or speak as if a Parliament should be called.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The State of the Court a∣bout that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> AND here it will give much Light to that which follows, if we take a View of the State of the Court, and of the Council at that time; by which we may best see the Face of that time, and the Affections and Temper of the People in general.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rise of the Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of <HI>Buckingham.</HI></NOTE> FOR the better taking this Prospect, we will begin with a survey of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Person of that great man, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> (who was so bar∣barously murdered about this time) whose Influence had been unfortu∣nate in the Publick affairs, and whose Death produced a change in all the Counsels. The Duke was indeed a very extraordinary Person, and never any Man, in any Age, nor, I believe, in any Country, or Nation, rose, in so short a time, to so much greatness of Honour, Fame, and Fortune, upon no other advantage or recommendation, than of the Beauty and Gracefulness of his Per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on. I have not the least purpose of undervaluing his good Parts and Qualities (of which there will be occa∣sion shortly to give some testimony) when I say, that his first intro∣duction <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> into Favour was purely from the Handsomness of his Person.</P>
<P>HE was a younger Son of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Villiers,</HI> of <HI>Brookesby</HI> in the County of <HI>Leicester;</HI> a Family of an ancient extraction, even from the time of the Conquest, and Transported then with the Conqueror out of <HI>Normandy,</HI> where the Family hath still remained, and still continues with Lustre. After S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George</HI>'s first marriage, in which he had two or three Sons, and some Daughters, who shared an ample Inheritance from him; by a second marriage with a Lady of the Family of the <HI>Beaumonts,</HI> he had this Gentleman, and two other Sons and a Daughter, who all came afterwards to be raised to great Titles and Dignities. <HI>George,</HI> the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> eldest Son of this second bed, was, after the death of his Father, by the singular affection and care of his Mother, who enjoyed a good Joyn∣ture, in the account of that age, well brought up; and, for the improve∣ment of his Education, and giving an ornament to his hopeful Person, he was by Her sent into <HI>France;</HI> where he spent two or three years in attaining the Language, and in learning the exercises of Riding and Dancing; in the last of which he excelled most men, and returned into <HI>England</HI> by the time he was 21 years old.</P>
<P>KING <HI>James</HI> reigned at that time, and though he was a Prince of more Learning and Knowledge than any other of that age, and really <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> delighted more in Books, and in the conversation of Learned men, yet, of all Wise men living, he was the most delighted and taken with Hand∣some Persons, and with Fine Cloaths. He begun to be weary of his Fa∣vourite, the Earl of <HI>Somerset,</HI> who was the only Favourite that kept that Post so long, without any publick reproach from the People. But, by the instigation and wickedness of his Wife, he became, at least Privy to a horrible murder, that exposed him to the utmost severity of the Law (the Poysoning of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Overbury)</HI> upon which both He, and his Wife were condemned to dy, after a Tryal by their Peers, and many Persons of Quality were executed for the same.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> WHILST this was in agitation, and before the utmost discovery was made, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Villiers</HI> appeared in Court, and drew the Kings eyes upon him. There were enough in the Court, sufficiently angry, and in∣censed against <HI>Somerset,</HI> for being what themselves desired to be, and
<PB N="10" REF="370"/>
especially for being a <HI>Scots</HI>-man, and ascending, in so short a time, from being a Page, to the Height he was then at, to contribute all they could to promote the One, that they might throw out the Other: which being easily brought to pass, by the proceeding of the Law upon his aforesaid Crime, the Other found very little difficulty in rendring him∣self Gracious to the King, whose Nature and Disposition was very flow∣ing in affection towards persons so adorned. Insomuch that, in few days after his first appearance in Court, he was made Cup-bearer to the King, by which he was, of course, to be much in his Presence, and so admitted to that conversation and discourse, with which that Prince <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> always abounded at his meals.</P>
<P>His Inclinations to his new Cup-bearer disposed him to administer frequent occasions of discoursing of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and the transactions there, with which he had been so lately acquainted, that he could pertinently enlarge upon that Subject, to the Kings great de∣light, and to the gaining the esteem and value of all the standers by to Himself: which was a thing the King was well pleased with. He acted very few weeks upon this Stage, when he mounted Higher, and, being Knighted, without any other Qualification, he was at the same time made Gentleman of the Bed-chamber, and Knight of the Order of the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Garter, and in a short time (very short for such a prodigious ascent) he was made a Baron, a Viscount, an Earl, a Marquis, and became Lord high Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Ma∣ster of the Horse, and entirely disposed of all the Graces of the King, in conferring all the Honours and all the Offices of three Kingdoms with∣out a Rival; in dispensing whereof, he was guided more by the rules of Appetite, than of Judgement, and so, exalted allmost all of his own numerous Family, and Dependants; whose greatest Merit was their Al∣liance to Him; which equally offended the ancient Nobility, and the People of all conditions, who saw the Flowers of the Crown every day <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> fading, and withered; whilst the Demeasnes, and Revenue thereof were sacrificed to the enriching a private Family (how well soever original∣ly extracted) scarce ever heard of before to the Nation, and the expences of the Court so vast and unlimited, that they had a sad prospect of that Poverty, and Necessity which afterwards befell the Crown, allmost to the ruin of it.</P>
<P>MANY were of opinion, that King <HI>James</HI> before his death, grew weary of this Favourite, and that, if he had lived, he would have de∣prived him at least of his large, and unlimited Power. And this imagi∣nation so prevailed with some men, as the Lord Keeper <HI>Lincoln,</HI> the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Earl of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> Lord high Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> and other Gentle∣men of Name, though not in so high Stations, that they had the courage to withdraw from their absolute dependance upon the Duke, and to make some other Essays, which proved to the Ruin of every one of them; there appearing no mark or evidence, that the King did really lessen his affection to Him, to the hour of his death. On the contrary, as he created him Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> in his Absence, whilst he was with the Prince in <HI>Spain,</HI> so, after their Return, the Duke executed the same Authority in conferring all Favours and Graces, and in revenging himself upon those, who had manifested any unkindness towards him. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> And yet notwithstanding all this, if that Kings nature had equally disposed him to pull down, as to build and erect; and if his courage and severity in punishing and reforming, had been as great, as his gene∣rosity
<PB N="11" REF="380"/>
and inclination was to oblige, it is not to be doubted, but that he would have withdrawn his affection from the Duke entirely, before his death; which those Persons, who were admitted to any Privacy with Him, and were not in the Confidence of the Other (for before Those he knew well how to dissemble) had reason enough to expect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of Pr. <HI>Charles</HI>'s Journey into <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> FOR it is certain, that the King was never well pleased with the Duke, after the Prince's going into <HI>Spain,</HI> which was infinitely against his Will, and contrived wholely by the Duke: Who, out of Envy, that the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> should have the sole management of so great an Af∣fair <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> (as hitherto that Treaty had been wholely conducted by him in <HI>Spain,</HI> where he was Extraordinary Embassadour, and all Particulars upon the matter agreed upon) had one day insinuated to the Prince the common misfortune of Princes, that in so substantial a part of their Happyness in this world, as depended upon their Marriage, Themselves had never any part, but must receive only an account from others of the nature, and humour, and beauty of the Ladys they were to marry; and those reports seldom proceeded from persons totally Uninterested, by reason of the parts, they had acted towards such preparations. From hence he discoursed, how Gallant and how Brave a thing it would be, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> for his Highness to make a Journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> and to fetch home his Mistris; that it would put an end presently to all those Formalities, which (though all Substantial matters were agreed upon already) ac∣cording to the Style of that Court, and the slow progress in all things of Ceremony, might yet retard the Infanta's voyage into <HI>England</HI> many months; all which would be in a moment removed by his Highnesses own Presence; that it would be such an Obligation to the Infanta her self, as she could never enough value or requite, and being a Respect rarely paid by any other Prince, upon the like addresses, could proceed only from the high regard and reverence he had for her Person; that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in the great affair that only remained undetermined, and was not en∣tirely yeilded to, though under a very friendly deliberation, which was the Restoring the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> it was very probable, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> himself might choose, in the Instant, to gratify his Personal In∣terposition, which, in a Treaty with an Embassadour, might be drawn out in length, or attended with overtures of recompense by some new Concessions, which would create new Difficulties; However that the Mediation could not but be frankly undertaken by the Infanta her self, who would ambitiously make it her work to pay a part of her great Debt to the Prince, and that he might, with Her, and by Her, present <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to his Majesty the entire peace, and restitution of his Family; which by no other Humane Means could be brought to pass.</P>
<P>THESE discourses made so deep impression upon the mind and spirit of the Prince (whose nature was inclined to Adventures) that he was transported with the Thought of it, and most impatiently sollicitous to bring it to pass. The greatest difficulty in view was, how they might procure the Kings consent, who was very Quick-sighted in discerning difficulties, and raising objections, and very Slow in mastering them, and untying the knotts he had made; In a word, he knew not how to wrestle with desperate Contingencies, and so abhorred the being en∣tangled <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in Such. This was first to be attempted by the Prince himself, by communicating it to the King, as his earnest desire and suit, with this circumstance, that Since his doing, or▪ not doing what he most de∣sired, depended wholely and entirely upon his Majestys own approba∣tion
<PB N="12" REF="390"/>
and command, he would vouchsafe to promise Not to Communi∣cate the thing proposed, before he had first taken his Own resolution; and that this condition should be first humbly insisted on, before the Substantial Point should be communicated; and so, this approach be∣ing first made, the success and prosecution was to be left to the Dukes credit and dexterity. All things being thus concerted between his Highness, and the Duke (and this the beginning of an entire Confidence between them, after a long time of declared Jealousy and Displeasure on the Prince's part, and Occasion enough administred on the Other) they shortly found fit opportunity (and there were seasons when that King <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> was to be approached more hopefully than in others) to make their address Together. His Majesty cheerfully consented to the Condition, and being well pleased that all should depend upon his Will, frankly promised, that he would not, in any degree, Communicate to any per∣son the matter, before he had taken, and communicated to Them his Own resolutions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince Proposes his Journey to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Father.</NOTE> THE Prince then, upon his knees, declared his Suit and very impor∣tunate Request, the Duke standing a long time by, without saying a word, while the King discoursed the whole matter to the Prince, with less Passion than they expected, and then look'd upon the Duke, as in∣clined <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to hear what He would say; who spoke nothing to the point whe∣ther, in prudence, Advisable or Not; but enlarged upon the infinite Obligation, his Majesty would confer upon the Prince, by his Yeilding to the violent passion his Highness was transported with; and, after many exalted expressions to that purpose, concluded, that he doubted, that his Majesty, refusing to grant the Prince this his humble request, would make a deep Impression upon his spirits, and peace of mind; and that he would, he fear'd, look upon it as the greatest Misfortune and Affliction, that could befall him in this world. The Prince, then taking the opportunity, from the good Temper he saw his Father in, to en∣large <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> upon those two Points, which he knew were most Important in the Kings Own wishes and judgement, That this expedient would put a Quick end to this Treaty, which could not be Continued, after his Ar∣rival in that Court, but that his Marriage must presently ensue, which, he knew well enough, the King did most impatiently desire of all Blessings in the world: He said likewise, he would undertake (and he could not but be believed from the Reasonableness of it) that his Pre∣sence would, in a moment, Determine the Restitution of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> to his Brother and Sister; which was the Second thing, the King longed most passionately to see, before he should leave this world. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>James</HI> Consents to it.</NOTE> THESE discourses, urged with all the artifice and address imagina∣ble, so far wrought upon, and prevail'd with the King, that, with less haesitation, than his Nature was accustomed to, and much less than was agreeable to his great Wisdom, he gave his approbation, and promised that the Prince should make the journey, he was so much inclined to. Whether he did not upon the Suddain comprehend the consequences, which would Naturally attend such a rash undertaking, or the less con∣sider▪d them, because Provisions, which must be made for such a journey, both with reference to the expence, and security of it, would take up much time, and could not be done in such a secret way, but that the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Counsel it self might be Resumed, when new measures should be taken. But this imagination was too reasonable not to be Foreseen by them, and so they had provided themselves accordingly: And therefore, as soon

as they had the Kings promise upon the main, they told him, the Secu∣rity of such a design depended on the Expedition, without which there could be no Secresy observed or hoped for; That, if it were Deferred, till such a Fleet could be made ready, and such an Equipage prepared as might be fit for the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> so much time would be spent, as would Disappoint the principal Ends of the Journey; If they should send for a Pass to <HI>France,</HI> the Ceremony in the asking and granting it, and that which would flow from it, in his passage through that King∣dom, would be, at least, liable to the same objection of Delay: besides <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> that, according to the mysteries and intrigues of State, such a Pass could not in point of security be reasonably Depended upon; And therefore they had thought of an expedient, which would avoid all Inconve∣niencies and Hazards; and that it should be Executed before it should be Suspected; that it had never hitherto been, in the least degree, con∣sulted but between Themselves (which was really true) and therefore, if they now undertook the journey only with two servants, who should not know any thing till the moment they were to depart, they might easily Pass through <HI>France,</HI> before they should be Miss'd at <HI>Whitehall;</HI> which was not hard to be conceived, and so with the less disquisition <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> was consented to by the King; and the farther Deliberation of what was more to be done both in matter, and manner, and the Nomination of the Persons who should attend them, and the Time for their depar∣ture was deferr'd to the consultation of the next day.</P>
<P>WHEN the King, in his retirement, and by himself, came to Re∣volve what had been so loosely consulted before, as he had a wonderfull Sagacity in such Reflections, a thousand Difficulties and Dangers occurr'd to him, and so many Precipices, which could hardly be avoided in such a journey; besides those considerations, which the violent affection of a Father to his only Son, suggested to him, he thought how ill an in∣fluence <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> it might have on his People, too much disposed to murmur and complain of the least Inadvertency; and that they look'd upon the Prince as the Son of the Kingdom, as well as his Own. He consider'd the reputation he should lose with all Forreign Princes (especially if any Ill Accident should happen) by so much departing from his Dignity in exposing the immediate Heir of the Crown, his only Son, to all the Dangers, and all the Jealousies, which particular Malice, or that fa∣thomless abyss of Reason of State, might prepare and contrive against him; and then, in how desperate a condition Himself, and his King∣doms should remain, if the Prince miscarried by such an unparallel'd <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> weakness of his, contrary to the light of his Understanding, as well as the current of his Affections.</P>
<P>THESE Reflections were so Terrible to him, that they Robbed him of all Peace and Quiet of Mind; insomuch as when the Prince, and Duke came to him about the Dispatch, he fell into a great Passion with Tears, and told them, that he was Undone, and that it would break his heart, if they pursued their Resolution; that upon a true and dispassionate dis∣quisition, he had made with Himself, he was abundantly convinced, that, besides the allmost inevitable Hazards of the Prince's Person, with whom his life was bound up, and besides the entire Loss of the affections <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of his People, which would unavoidably attend this rash action, he foresaw, it would ruin the whole design, and irrecoverably Break the Match. For whereas all those Particulars, upon which he could positive∣ly and of right Insist, were fully Granted (for That, which concern'd the
<PB N="14" REF="410"/>
Prince Elector, who had unexcusably and directly against his Advice, incurr'd the Ban of the Empire in an Imperial Dyet, must be wrought off by Mediation and Treaty, could not be insilted on in Justice) nor could <HI>Spain</HI> make any new Demands, all the Overtures they had made being Adjusted; The Prince should no sooner arrive at <HI>Madrid,</HI> than all the Articles of the Treaty should be laid Aside, and New matter be proposed, which had not been yet mention'd, and could never be con∣sented to by him; That the Treaty of this Marriage, how well soever received, and how much soever desired by the King, and his cheif Mi∣nisters, was, in no degree, acceptable to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation in general, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and less to the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> where, though the new Pope seem'd more inclined to grant the Dispensation than his Predecessor had been, it was plain enough, that it proceeded only from the apprehension he had to Displease the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> not that he was less averse from the Match, it having been allways believed both in <HI>Spain,</HI> and in <HI>Rome,</HI> that this Marriage was to be attended with a full Repeal of all the Penal Laws against the Papists, and a plenary Toleration of the exercise of that Re∣ligion in <HI>England,</HI> which they now saw concluded without any signal or real Benefit, or Advantage to them. And therefore they might ex∣pect, and be confident, that when they had the Person of the Prince of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Wales</HI> in their hands, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> (though in his own nature and inclinations full of Honour and Justice) would be even Compell'd by his Clergy (who had allways a great influence upon the Counsels of that Kingdom) and the Importunities from <HI>Rome,</HI> who would tell him, that God had put it now into his hand to advance the Catholick Cause, to make new Demands for those of that Religion here; which, though he could never consent to, would, at best, interpose such Delays in the Marriage, that he should never live to see it brought to pass, nor probably to see his Son return again from <HI>Spain.</HI> Then he put the Duke in mind (whom he hitherto believed only to comply with the Prince, to Oblige <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> him, after a long alienation from his Favour) how inevitable his Ruin must be, by the effect of this Counsel, how Ungracious he was allready with the People, and how many Enemies he had, amongst the greatest Persons of the Nobility, who would make such use of this occasion, that it would not be in his Majestys Power to Protect him. And then he Con∣cluded with the Disorder and Passion, with which he begun, with Sighs and Tears, to conjure them, that they would no more press him to give his consent to a Thing, so contrary to his Reason, and Understanding, and Interest, the execution whereof would break his heart, and that they would give over any further pursuit of it. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THE Prince, and the Duke took not the pains to answer any of the Reasons, his Majesty had insisted on; his Highness only putting him in mind of the Promise he had made to him the day before, which was so Sacred, that he hoped he would not Violate it; which if he should, it would make him never think more of Marriage. The Duke, who better knew, what kind of arguments were of Prevalence with him, treated him more Rudely, told him, Nobody could Believe any thing he Said, when he retracted so soon the promise he had so solemnly made; that he plainly discern'd, that it proceeded from an other Breach of his Word, in communicating with some Rascal, who had furnish'd him with those <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Pittyfull Reasons he had alledg'd, and he doubted not but he should hereafter know who his Counsellor had been; That if he receded from what he had promised, it would be such a Disobligation to the Prince.

who had set his heart now upon the journey, after his Majesty's appro∣bation, that he could never Forget it, nor Forgive any man who had been the Cause of it.</P>
<P>THE Prince, who had allways express'd the highest Duty and Re∣verence towards the King, by his humble and importunate Entreaty, and the Duke, by his rougher Dialect, in the end prevailed so far (after his Majesty had Passionately, and with many Oaths renounced the having Communicated the matter with any Person living) that the debate was again resumed upon the journey, which they earnestly desired might <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> not be Deferr'd, but that they might take their Leaves of the King within two days, in which they would have all things ready that were neces∣sary, his Highness pretending to Hunt at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> and the Duke to take Physick at <HI>Chelsey.</HI></P>
<P>THEY told him, that being to have only Two more in their com∣pany, as was before resolved, they had thought (if he approved them) upon S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Francis Cottington,</HI> and <HI>Endymion Porter,</HI> who, though they might safely, should not be Trusted with the Secret, till they were even ready to be embarqued. The Persons were both Grateful to the King, the former having been long his Majestys Agent in the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and was now Secretary to the Prince; the other, having been bred in <HI>Madrid,</HI> after many years attendance upon the Duke, was now one of the Bedchamber to the Prince: So that his Majesty cheerfully approved the Election they had made, and wish'd, it might be presently imparted to them; saying that many things would occur to them, as necessary to the journey, that they two would never think of; and took that oc∣casion to send for S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Francis Cottington</HI> to come presently to him (whilst the other two remained with him) who being, of custome, waiting in the outward room, was quickly brought in; whilst the Duke whisper'd the Prince in the ear, that <HI>Cottington</HI> would be against the Journey, and his <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Highness answer'd he Durst not.</P>
<P>THE King told him, that he had allways been an Honest man, and therefore he was now to Trust him in an Affair of the highest Impor∣tance, which he was not, upon his life to Disclose, to any man alive; then said to him, <HI>Cottington</HI> here is Baby <HI>Charles</HI> and <HI>Stenny</HI> (an appel∣lation he allways used, of and towards the Duke) who have a great mind to go by Post into <HI>Spain,</HI> to fetch Home the Infanta, and will have but Two more in their company, and have chosen You for one. What think you of the journey? (He often protested since, that, when he heard the King, he fell into such a trembling, that he could hardly speak. But <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> when the King Commanded him to answer him, what He thought of the journey) he replyed that he could not think Well of it, and that he believ'd, it would render all that had been done towards the Match, Fruitless: for that <HI>Spain</HI> would no longer think themselves Obliged by those Articles, but that, when they had the Prince in their hands, they would make New overtures, which they believ'd more Advantageous to them; amongst which they must look for many, that would concern Religion, and the Exercise of it in <HI>Enlgand.</HI> Upon which the King threw himself upon his bed, and said, I told you this before, and fell in∣to new Passion, and Lamentation, that he was Undone and should Lose <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Baby <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P>THERE appear'd Displeasure and Anger enough in the Countenances both of the Prince and Duke; the latter saying that, as soon as the King sent for him, he whisper'd the Prince in the ear, that he would be against
<PB N="16" REF="430"/>
it; that he knew his Pride well enough; and that, because he had not been first advised with, he was resolv'd to dislike it; and therefore he reproach'd <HI>Cottington</HI> with all possible bitterness of Words, told him the King asked him only of the Journey, and which would be the best Way, of which he might be a competent counsellor, having made the way so often by Post; but that he had the presumption to give his advice upon Matter of State, and against his Master, without being call'd to it, which he should repent as long as he lived; with a thousand new re∣proaches, which put the poor King into a new Agony, on the behalf of a Servant, who he foresaw would Suffer for answering him Honestly. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Upon which he said, with some commotion, Nay, by God <HI>Stenny,</HI> you are very much to blame to use him so; he answer'd me directly to the Question I ask'd him, and very Honestly and Wisely▪ and yet you know he said no more, than I told you, before he was call'd in. However, after all this passion on both parts, the King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eilded; and the Journey was at that conference agreed on, and all directions given accordingly to S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Francis Cottington;</HI> the King having now plainly discover'd, that the Whole Intrigue was originally Contrived by the Duke, and so violently Pursued by His spirit and impetuosity.</P>
<P>THE manner, circumstances, and conclusion of that Voyage, with <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the Extraordinary Accidents that happen'd in it, will no doubt be at large remember'd by whosoever shall have the courage to write the transactions of that Time, with that Integrity he ought to do: in which it will manifestly appear, how much of the Prophet was in the wisdom of the King; and that that design'd Marriage, which had been so many years in Treaty, even from the Death of Prince <HI>Harry,</HI> and so near concluded, was solely Broken by that Journey; which, with the passages before mention'd, King <HI>James</HI> never Forgave the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> but retain'd as sharp a memory of it, as His nature could contain.</P>
<P>THIS Indisposition of the King towards the Duke was exceedingly <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> encreased, and aggravated, upon and after the Prince's return out of <HI>Spain.</HI> For though it brought infinite Joy and Delight to his Majesty, which he express'd in all imaginable Transport, and was the argument of the loudest, and most universal rejoycing over the whole Kingdom, that the Nation had ever been acquainted with; in which the Duke had so full a Harvest, that the Imprudence, and Presumption (to say no more) of carrying the Prince into <HI>Spain</HI> was totally Forgotten, or not remem∣ber'd with any Reference to him, and the high Merit and inestimable Obligation, in bringing him Home, was Remember'd, Magnified, and Celebrated by all Men in all Places; Yet the King was wonderfully <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> disquieted, when he found (which he had not, before their Return, suspected) that the Prince was totally Aliened from all thoughts of, or inclination to the Marriage, and that they were resolv'd to Break it with, or without his approbation, or consent. And in This the Duke resumed the same impetuosity, he had so much indulged to Himself in the debate of the journey into <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament is Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l'd af∣ter the Prince's Return.</NOTE> THE King had, upon the Prince's Return, issued out Writs to call a Parliament, which was in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> year of his Reign, thinking it neces∣sary, with relation to the perplexities he was in, for the Breach of this Match with <HI>Spain</HI> (which he foresaw must ensue) and the Sad condition <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of his Only Daughter in <HI>Germany,</HI> with her numerous Issue, to receive their grave Advice. By the time the Parliament could meet, the Prince's entire Confidence being reposed still in the Duke, as the King's seem'd to
<PB N="17" REF="440"/>
be, the Duke had wrought himself into the very great Esteem and Con∣fidence of the principal Members of both Houses of Parliament, who were most like to be the Leading Men, and had all a desire to have as much Reputation in the Court, as they had in the Country. It was very reasonably thought necessary, that as the King would, at the opening of the Parliament, make mention of the Treaty with <HI>Spain,</HI> and more at large of his Daughters being driven out of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> which would require their assistance and aid; so that the Prince and Duke should, afterwards, to one or both Houses, as occasion should be offer'd, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> make a Relation of what had pass'd in <HI>Spain,</HI> especially concerning the <HI>Palatinate:</HI> that so the Houses being put into some Method and Order of their future debate, they might be more easily regulated, than if they were in the beginning left to that Liberty, which they naturally affected, and from which they would not be restrain'd, but in such a manner, as would be grateful to Themselves.</P>
<P>THINGS being thus concerted, after the Houses had been three or four days together (for, in that time, some days were allways spent in the formality of naming Committees, and providing for common Occur∣rences, before they made an entrance upon more solemn Debates) the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Prince began to speak of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Affairs, and of his own Journey thither, and forgot not to mention the Duke with more than ordinary affection. Whereupon it was thought fit, that the whole Affair, which was likewise to be the principal Subject Matter of all their Consultations, should be stated and enlarged upon, in a Conference between the two Houses, which his Highness and the Duke were desired to manage. How little notice soever any body else could take of the Change, the Duke himself too well knew the hearty resentment the King had of what had pass'd, and the affection he still had for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Treaty: and therefore he had done, and resolv'd still to do, all he could, to make <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> himself grateful to the Parliament; and popular amongst the People; who, he knew, had allways detested the Match with <HI>Spain,</HI> or intruth any Alliance with that Nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince and Duke's Account of the Journey at a Confe∣rence be∣tween both Houses.</NOTE> So when, at the Conference, the Prince had made a short Intro∣duction to the business, and said some very kind things of the Duke, of his wonderful Care of him, whilst he was in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the great Dexte∣rity he used in getting him away; he referr'd the whole Relation to Him: Who said, <Q>“”That the true Ground of the Prince's Journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> which, he well knew, had begot such a terrible panting in the hearts of all good English-men, had been only to make a clear disco∣very <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of the Sincerity of the Spaniard, and, if his intentions were real, to put a speedy End to it by marrying of the Lady upon the place; if he found it otherwise, to put his Father, and Himself at li∣berty to dispose of Himself in some other place. That the Embassador in whose hands that great Affair was solely managed, when, in one Dispatch, he writ that all was Concluded, in the next, used to give an account of new Difficulties, and new Demands; And, when all things were Adjusted at <HI>Madrid,</HI> some unexpected Scruples discover'd them∣selves at <HI>Rome,</HI> with which the Councils in <HI>Spain</HI> seem'd to be sur∣prized, and appear'd to be confounded, and not to know what to say. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> These Ebbs and Floods made the Prince apprehend, that the purpose was to amuse Us, whilst They had other Designs in secret agitation. And thereupon, that his Highness had prevail'd with his Father (how unwilling soever) to permit him to make the Journey, that he might
<PB N="18" REF="450"/>
make that useful Discovery, which could not otherwise be made in any seasonable time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THAT they no sooner came to <HI>Madrid,</HI> than they Discover'd (though the Prince was treated with all the Respect due to his Great∣ness, and the Obligation he had laid upon that Nation) that there had never been any real purpose that the Infanta should be given to him: That, during so long an abode, as his Highness made there, they had never procured the Dispensation from <HI>Rome;</HI> which they might easily have done: And that at last, upon the death of the Pope, <HI>Gregory</HI> the 15<SUP>th</SUP>, the whole Process was to begin again, and would be transacted <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> with the Formalities, which they should find necessary to their other affairs. That, instead of Proceeding upon the Articles, which had been pretended to be Concluded, they urged nothing but New de∣mands; and, in matters of Religion, so Peremptorily, that the principal Clergy-men, and the most eminent of that King's Preachers, had fre∣quent Conferences with the Prince, to perswade him to change his Religion, and become a Papist. And, in order to move him the more successfully thereunto, they procured the Pope to write a Letter him∣self to his Highness, putting him in mind of the Religion of his Ance∣stours, and Progenitours, and conjuring him to Return to the same <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Faith; but that it had pleased God not only to give the Prince a con∣stant, and unshaken Heart in his Religion, but such wonderful abi∣lities to Defend the same in his Discourse, and Arguments, that they stood amazed to Hear him, and upon the matter confess'd that they were not able to Answer him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THAT they would not suffer the Prince to confer with, or so much as to speak to, hardly, and very rarely to see his Mistris, whom they pretended he should forthwith marry. That they could never obtain any better answer in the business of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> than that the Re∣storing it was not in the power of that King, though it had been taken <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> by the sole power of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army, under the Command of the Marquis <HI>Spinola,</HI> who was then in the entire Possession of it; but that his Catholick Majesty would use his Interposition, with all the credit he had with the Emperour, and Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> without whose joynt consent it could not be done, and whose consent he hoped to obtain; but that He was well assured, that there was no more real intention in that point of Restitution, than in the other of Marriage; and that the <HI>Palatinate</HI> could not be hoped to be recovered any other way than by Force,</Q> which would easily bring it to pass.</P>
<P>THROUGHOUT his whole discourse he made frequent Reflections <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> upon the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> as if he very well knew the Spaniards purpose in the whole, and concurr'd with them in it. <Q>“”That he was so much troubled, when he first saw the Prince, who alighted at his house, that he could not contain himself, but wish'd that his Highness were at Home again: That he had afterwards, when he found that his High∣ness liked the Infanta, perswaded him in private that he would become a Papist; and that, without changing his Religion, it would not be pos∣sible ever to compass that Marriage.</Q></P>
<P>HE told them, <Q>“”That the King had sent for the Earl to return Home, where he should be call'd to account for all his Miscarriages.</Q> Whereas <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in truth the King had recall'd him rather to assist him against the Duke, than to expose him to his malice, and fury; his Majesty having a great esteem of that Earl's Fidelity to him, and of his great Abilities.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Middlesex</HI> his Rise, and Fall.</NOTE> HIS Majesty had another Exception against the Duke, which touch'd him as near, and in which he enlarged himself much more. <HI>Lionel Cran∣feild,</HI> who (though extracted from a Gentleman's family) had been bred <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in the City, and, being a man of great wit and understanding in all the mysteries of Trade, had found means to work himself into the good opi∣nion, and favour of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> and, having shortly after married a near Relation of the Dukes, with wonderfull expedition was made a Privy-Counsellor, Master of the Wardrobe, Master of the Wards, and, without parting with any of these, was now become Lord high Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> and had gain'd so much Credit with the King (being in truth a man of great parts and notable dexterity) that, during the Duke's absence in <HI>Spain,</HI> he was not only negligent in the issuing out such sums of money, as were neces∣sary <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> for the defraying those unlimited Expences, and to correspond with Him with that deference he had used to do, but had the courage to dispute His commands, and to Appeal to the King, whose ear was allways inclined to him, and in Whom he begun to believe himself so far fastened, that he should not stand in need of the future support of the Favourite. And of all this the Duke could not be without ample infor∣mation, as well from his own creatures, who were near enough to ob∣serve; as from others, who, caring for Neither of them, were more scan∣dalized at so precipitate a Promotion of a person of Such an Education, and whom they had long known so Much their Inferiour, though it could <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> not be denied, that he Fill'd the Places he held, with great abilities.</P>
<P>THE Duke no sooner found the Parliament disposed to a good opi∣nion of him, and being well assured of the Prince's fast kindness, than he projected the Ruin of this bold Rival of his; of whom he saw clearly enough, that the King had so good an opinion, that it would not be in his sole power to crush Him, as he had done others, in the same, and as high a station. And so he easily procured some Leading Men in the House of Commons, to cause an Impeachment for several Corruptions and Misdemeanours to be sent up to the House of Peers against that great Minister, whom they had so lately known their Equal in that House; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> which (besides their natural Inclination to that kind of Correction) disposed them with great alacrity to this Prosecution. The wise King knew well enough the Ill Consequence, that must attend Such an acti∣vity; and that it would shake his Own Authority in the Choice of his
<PB N="20" REF="470"/>
Own Ministers, when they should find, that their Security did not de∣pend solely upon his Own Protection: Which Breach upon his Kingly power was so much without a Precedent (except one unhappy one made three years before, to gratify likewise a Private displeasure) that the like had not been practised in very many years.</P>
<P>WHEN this Prosecution was first enter'd upon, and that the King clearly discern'd it was contrived by the Duke, and that he had likewise prevail'd with the Prince to be well pleased with it; his Majesty sent for them, and, with much warmth and passion, disswaded them from appearing Farther in it; and conjured them <Q>“”to use all their interest and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> authority to restrain it, as such a Wound to the Crown, that would not be easily healed.</Q> And when he found the Duke unmov'd by all the considerations, and arguments, and commands, he had offer'd, he said, in greater choler, <Q>“”By God <HI>Stenny</HI> you are a Fool, and will shortly repent this folly, and will find, that, in this Fit of popularity, you are making a Rod,</Q> with which you will be scourged your Self: And turn∣ing in some anger to the Prince, told him, <Q>“”That he would live to have his belly full of Parliament Impeachments: and, when I shall be dead, you will have too much cause to remember, how much You have contributed to the Weak'ning of the Crown, by the Two Precedents, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> you are Now so fond of;</Q> intending as well the Engaging the Parlia∣ment in the War, as the Prosecution of the Earl of <HI>Middlesex.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Duke's power (supported by the Prince's countenance) was grown so great in the two Houses, that it was in vain for the King to interpose; and so (notwithstanding so good a Defence made by the Earl, that he was absolv'd from any notorious crime, by the impartial opi∣nion of many of those, who heard all the evidence) he was at last con∣demn'd in a great Fine, to a long and strict Imprisonment, and Never to sit in Parliament during his life: a clause of such a nature as was never before found in any Judgement of Parliament, and, intruth, not to be <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> inflicted upon any Peer but by Attainder.</P>

death many scandalous, and libellous Discourses were raised, without the least colour, or ground; as appear'd upon the strictest, and most malicious Examination that could be made, long after, in a time of Li∣cence, when nobody was afraid of offending Majesty, and when prose∣cuting the highest Reproaches, and Contumelies against the Royal Fa∣mily, was held very meritorious.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Charles</HI> succeeds him, the Duke con∣t nuing in Fa∣vour.</NOTE> UPON the death of King <HI>James, Charles</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> succeeded to the Crown, with as universal a Joy in the People, as can be imagin'd, and in a Conjuncture, when all the other Parts of <HI>Christendom,</HI> being <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> engaged in War, were very sollicitous for his Friendship; and the more, because he had allready discover'd an Activity, that was not like to suffer him to sit still. The Duke continued in the Same degree of Favour at the least, with the Son, which he had enjoyed so many years under the Father. A rare Felicity! seldom known, and in which the expectation of very many was exceedingly disappointed; who, knowing the great jealousy and indignation, that the Prince had heretofore conceiv'd against the Duke, for having been once very near Striking him, expected that he would Now remember that Insolence, of which he Then so often complain'd; without considering the opportunity the Duke had, by the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> conversation with the Prince, during his journey into <HI>Spain</HI> (which was so grateful to him) and whilst he was there, to wipe out the me∣mory of all former Oversights, by making them appear to be of a less magnitude, than they had been understood before, and to be excusable from other causes, still being severe enough to himself for his Unwary part, whatsoever excuses he might make for the Excess: and by this means to make new Vows for himself, and to ty new Knotts to restrain the Prince from future jealousies. And it is very true, his hopes in this kind never fail'd him; the new King from the death of the old, even to the death of the Duke himself, discovering the most entire Confidence in, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and even Friendship to Him, that ever King had shewed to any Subject: all Preferments in Church and State given by Him; all his Kindred, and Friends promoted to the degree in Honour, or Riches, or Offices, that He thought fit, and all his Enemies and Envyers discountenanced, as He appointed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Charles</HI>'s First Parlia∣ment call'd.</NOTE> BUT a Parliament was necessary to be call'd, as at the entrance of all Kings to the Crown, for the continuance of some Supplies and Revenue to the King, which have been still used to be granted in that season. And now he quickly found how Prophetick the last King's Predictions had proved, and were like to prove. The Parliament that had so rashly ad∣vanced <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the War, and so passionately adhered to his Person, was now no more; and though the House of Peers consisted still of the same men, and most of the principal men of the House of Commons were again elected to serve in this Parliament, yet they were far from wedding the War, or taking themselves to be concern'd to make good any Declaration made by the former: So that though the War was entred In, all hope of obtaining money to carry it On was even desperate; and the affection they had for the Duke, and confidence in him, was not Then so manifest, as the Prejudice they had Now, and animosity against him, was visible to all the world. All the Actions of his life ripp'd up, and survey'd, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and all malicious Glosses made upon all he had said, and all he had done: Votes and Remonstrances pass'd against him as an Enemy to the Publick; and his Ill Management made the ground of their Refusal to give the King that Supply, he had reason to expect, and was absolutely necessary

to the state he was in. And this kind of treatment was so ill suited to the Duke's great Spirit, which indeed might have easily been Bowed, but could very hardly be Broken, that it wrought contrary effects upon his high mind, and his Indignation, to find himself so used by the same Men. For they who flatter'd him most Before, mention'd him Now with the greatest bitterness and acrimony; and the same Men, who had call'd him our Saviour, for bringing the Prince safe out of <HI>Spain,</HI> call'd him now the Corrupter of the King, and Betrayer of the Liberties of the Peo∣ple, without imputing the least crime to him, to have been committed since the time of that exalted Adulation, or that was not then as much <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> known to them, as it could be now: so fluctuating and unsteady a testi∣mony is the Applause of Popular Councils.</P>

And many Persons, of the best quality and condition under the Peerage, were Committed to several Prisons, with circumstances unusual and unheard of, for re∣fusing to pay Money required by those extraordinary ways; and the Duke himself would passionately Say, and frequently Do many things, which only griev'd his Friends, and incensed his Enemies, and gave them as well the Ability, as the Inclination to do him much Harm.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Duke of Buc∣kingham</NOTE> JOHN <HI>Felton,</HI> an obscure man in his own person, who had been bred a Soldier, and lately a Lieutenant of a Foot company, whose Captain had been kill'd upon the Retreat at the Isle of <HI>Ree,</HI> upon which he con∣ceiv'd
<PB N="23" REF="500"/>
that the Company of right ought to have been conferr'd upon Him, and it being refused to him by the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> General of the Army, had given up his Commission of Lieutenant, and with∣drawn himself from the Army. He was of a melancholick nature, and had little conversation with any body, yet of a Gentleman's family, in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> of good fortune and reputation. From the time that he had quitted the Army, he resided in <HI>London;</HI> when the House of Commons, transported with Passion and Prejudice against the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> had accused him to the House of Peers for several Misdemeanours, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Miscarriages, and in some Declaration had styled him <Q>“”the cause of all the Evils the Kingdom suffer'd,</Q> and an Enemy to the Publick.</P>
<P>SOME Transcripts of such Expressions (for the late Licence of Print∣ing all mutinous, and seditious Discourses was not yet in fashion) and some general Invectives, he met with amongst the People, to whom that great Man was not grateful, wrought so far upon this melancholick Gen∣tleman, that by degrees, and (as he said upon some of his Examinations) by frequently hearing some popular Preachers in the City (who yet were not arrived at the Presumption, and Impudence, they have been Since transported with) he believ'd he should do God good service, if he <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Kill'd the Duke; which he shortly after resolv'd to do. He chose no other Instrument to do it with, than an ordinary Knife, which he bought of a common Cutler for a Shilling: and thus provided he repair'd to <HI>Ports∣mouth,</HI> where he arrived the Eve of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Bartholomew.</HI> The Duke was then there, in order to Prepare and make Ready the Fleet, and the Army, with which he resolv'd in few days to transport himself to the Relief of <HI>Rochel,</HI> which was then straitly befieged by the Cardinal <HI>Richelieu;</HI> and for the Relief whereof the Duke was the more obliged, by reason that, at his being at the Isle of <HI>Ree,</HI> he had receiv'd great Sup∣plies of Victuals, and some Companys of their Garrison from that Town, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the want of both which they were at this time very sensible of, and griev'd at.</P>
<P>THIS morning of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Bartholomew</HI> the Duke had receiv'd Letters, in which he was advertised that <HI>Rochel</HI> had Reliev'd it self; upon which he directed that his Break-fast might speedily be made ready, and he would make hast to acqnaint the King with the good news, the Court being then at <HI>Southwick,</HI> the House of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Daniel Norton</HI> five miles from <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> The chamber, wherein he was dressing himself, was full of company, of Persons of Quality, and Officers of the Fleet and Army.</P>
<P>THERE was Monsieur <HI>de Soubize</HI> Brother to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and other <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen, who were very sollicitous for the Em∣barcation of the Army, and for the Departure of the Fleet for the Relief of <HI>Rochel:</HI> and they were at that time in much trouble and perplexity, out of apprehension that the news the Duke had receiv'd that morning might slacken the preparations for the Voyage, which their Impatience, and Interest perswaded them were not advanced with expedition; and so they had then held much discourse with the Duke of the impossibility that his Intelligence could be true, and that it was contrived by the arti∣fice and dexterity of their Enemies, in order to abate the warmth and zeal, that was used for their Relief, the arrival of which Relief those <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Enemies had so much reason to apprehend; and a little longer Delay in sending it would ease them of that terrible apprehension, their Forts and Works toward the Sea, and in the Harbour, being allmost finish'd.</P>
<P>THIS discourse, according to the natural custom of that Nation, and
<PB N="24" REF="510"/>
by the usual Dialect of that Language, was held with that Passion, and Vehemence, that the standers by, who understood not <HI>French,</HI> did be∣lieve that they were angry, and that they used the Duke rudely. He being ready, and inform'd that his Break-fast was ready, drew towards the door, where the hangings were held up; and, in that very Passage, turning himself to speak with S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Fryar,</HI> a Colonel of the Army, who was then speaking near his ear, he was on the suddain Struck over his shoulder upon the Breast with a Knife; upon which, without using any other words, but, <HI>The Villain hath Kill'd me;</HI> and in the same mo∣ment pulling out the Knife himself, he fell down Dead, the Knife having <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> pierced his Heart.</P>
<P>No man had seen the Blow, or the Man who gave it, but in the confusion, they were in, every man made his own conjecture, and de∣clared it as a thing known; most agreeing that it was done by the <HI>French,</HI> from the angry discourse they thought they had heard from Them. And it was a kind of a Miracle, that they were not all Kill'd in that in∣stant; the Sober sort, that preserv'd them from it, having the same opi∣nion of their Guilt, and only reserving them for a more Judicial Exami∣nation and Proceeding.</P>
<P>IN the Crowd near the door there was found upon the ground a Hat, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in the inside whereof there was sow'd upon the crown a Paper, in which were writ four or five lines of that Declaration made by the House of Commons, in which they had styled the Duke an Enemy to the King∣dom; and under it a short Ejaculation or two towards a Prayer. It was easily enough concluded that the Hat belong'd to the Person, who had committed the Murther: but the difficulty remain'd still as great, Who that person should be? for the writing discover'd nothing of the Name, and whosoever it was, it was very natural to believe, that he was gone far enough, not to be found without a Hat.</P>
<P>IN this Hurry, one running one way, another another way, a Man <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> was seen walking before the door very composedly Without a Hat; whereupon one crying out, <HI>Here is the Fellow that Kill'd the Duke;</HI> upon which others run thither, every body asking, <HI>Which is He? Which is He?</HI> to which the Man without the Hat very composedly answer'd, <HI>I am He.</HI> Thereupon some of those who were most Furious, suddainly run upon the man, with their drawn swords to Kill him; but others, who were at least equally concern'd in the Loss, and in the Sense of it, defended him; Himself with open arms very calmly and chearfully ex∣posing himself to the Fury and Swords of the most enraged, as being very willing to fall a Sacrifice to their suddain Anger, rather than to be kept <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> for that deliberate Justice, which he knew must be executed upon him.</P>
<P>HE was now known enough, and easily discover'd to be that <HI>Felton,</HI> whom we mention'd before, who had been a Lieutenant in the Army: He was quickly carryed into a private room by the persons of the best condition, some whereof were in Authority, who first thought fit so far to dissemble, as to mention the Duke only grievously Wounded, but not without hope of Recovery. Upon which <HI>Felton</HI> smiled, and said, he knew well enough he had given him a Blow, that had Determin'd all their Hopes. Being then ask'd (which was the discovery principally aim'd at) by whose Instigation he had perform'd that horrid and wicked act; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> he answer'd them with a wonderful assurance, <Q>“”That they should not trouble themselves in that Enquiry; that no man living had credit or power enough with him to have engaged, or disposed him to such an
<PB N="25" REF="520"/>
action; that he had never intrusted his purpose and resolution to any man; that it proceeded only from Himself, and the impulse of his own Conscience; and that the Motives thereunto would appear, if his Hat were found, in which he had therefore fix'd them, because he believ'd it very probable that he might perish in the Attempt. He confess'd that he had come to the Town but the night before, and had kept his lodg∣ing, that he might not be seen, or taken notice of: and that he had come that morning to the Duke's lodging, where he had waited at the door for his coming out; and when he found, by the motions within, that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> he was coming, he drew to the door, as if he held up the hanging; and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Fryar</HI> speaking with the Duke, as hath been said, and being of a much lower stature than the Duke, who a little inclined towards him,</Q> he took the opportunity of giving the Blow over His shoulders.</P>
<P>HE spoke very frankly of what he had done, and bore the reproaches of those who spoke to him, with the temper of a man who thought he had not done amiss. But after he had been in Prison some time, where he was treated without any rigour, and with humanity enough; and be∣fore, and at his Trial, which was about four months after, at the Kings bench Bar, he behaved himself with great modesty and wonderful repen∣tance; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> being, as he said, convinced in his conscience, that he had done Wickedly, and ask'd the pardon of the King, and Duchess, and of all the Duke's Servants, whom he acknowledg'd to have offended; and very earnestly besought the Judges that he might have his hand struck off, with which he had perform'd that impious act, before he should be put to death.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's receiving the news of the Duke's death.</NOTE> THE Court was too near <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and too many Courtiers upon the place, to have this Murther (so barbarous in the nature and circum∣stances, the like whereof had not been known in <HI>England</HI> many ages) long conceal'd from the King. His Majesty was at the publick Prayers <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of the Church, when S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hippesly</HI> came into the room, with a troubled countenance, and without any pause, in respect of the Exercise they were performing, went directly to the King, and whisper'd in his ear what had fall'n out. His Majesty continued unmov'd, and without the least change in his countenance, till Prayers were ended; when he suddainly departed to his chamber, and threw himself upon his bed, la∣menting with much passion, and with abundance of tears, the Loss he had of an excellent Servant, and the horrid manner in which he had been deprived of him: and he continued in this melancholick discomposure of mind many days.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> YET his manner of receiving the news in Publick, when it was first brought him in the presence of so many (who knew of saw nothing of the passion he express'd upon his retreat) made many men believe, that the accident was not very ungrateful; at least, that it was very indiffe∣rent to him; as being rid of a Servant very ungracious to the People, and the prejudice to whose Person exceedingly obstructed all overtures made in Parliament for his service.</P>
<P>AND, upon this observation, Persons of all conditions took great li∣cence in speaking of the person of the Duke, and dissecting all his infirmi∣ties, believing they should not thereby incur any displeasure of the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> King's. In which they took very ill measures; for from that time allmost to the time of his own death, the King admitted very few into any de∣gree of trust, who had ever discover'd themselves to be Enemies to the Duke, or against whom he had manifested a notable prejudice. And
<PB N="26" REF="530"/>
sure never any Prince express'd a more lively regret for the Loss of a Servant, than his Majesty did for this great Man, in his constant favour and kindness to his Wife and Children; in all offices of grace towards his Servants; and in a wonderful sollicitous care for the Payment of his Debts; which, it is very true, were Contracted for his Majestys service; though in such a manner, that there remain'd no evidence of it, nor were any of the Duke's Officers intrusted with the knowledge of it, nor any record kept of it, but in the King's own generous memory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Character of the Duke</NOTE> THIS great man was a Person of a Noble nature, and Generous dis∣position, and of such other Endowments, as made him very capable of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> being a great Favourite to a great King. He understood the Arts of a Court, and all the Learning that is profess'd There, exactly well. By long practise in business, under a Master that discoursed excellently, and surely knew all things wonderfully, and took much delight in Indoctrinating his young unexperienced Favourite, who, he knew, would be allways look'd upon as the Workmanship of his Own hands, He had obtain'd a quick conception, and apprehension of Business, and had the habit of Speaking very gracefully, and pertinently. He was of a most flowing Courtesy and Affability, to all men who made any address to him; and so desirous to Oblige them, that he did not enough consider the Value of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the obligation, or the Merit of the person he chose to oblige; from which, much of his Misfortune resulted. He was of a Courage not to be daunted, which was manifested in all his Actions, and in his Contests with particu∣lar persons of the greatest reputation; and especially in his whole de∣meanour at the Isle of <HI>Ree,</HI> both at the Landing, and upon the Retreat; in both which no man was more fearless, or more ready to expose him∣self to the highest dangers. His Kindness, and Affection to his Friends was so vehement, that they were as so many marriages for better and worse, and so many leagues offensive and defensive; as if he thought him∣self obliged to love all his Friends, and to make war upon all They were <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> angry with, let the cause be what it would. And it cannot be denied, that he was an Enemy in the same excess; and prosecuted those he look'd upon as his Enemies, with the utmost rigour and animosity; and was not easily induced to reconciliation. And yet there were some examples of his receding in that particular. And when he was in the highest pas∣sion, he was so far from stooping to any Dissimulation, whereby his dis∣pleasure might be conceal'd and cover'd, till he had attain'd his revenge, (the low method of Courts) that he never endeavour'd to do any man an ill office, before he first told him what he was to expect from him, and reproach'd him with the injuries he had done, with so much generosity, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that the person found it in his power to receive surther satisfaction, in the way he would choose for himself.</P>
<P>IN this manner he proceeded with the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> a man of great Name in that time, and whom he had endeavour'd by many civil offices to make his Friend, and who seem'd equally to incline to the Friendship: when he discover'd (or as many thought but suspected) that the Earl was enter'd into some Cabal in Parliament against him; he could not be disswaded by any of his Friends, to whom he imparted his resolution, but meeting the Earl the next day, he took him aside, and after many reproaches for such and such ill offices, he had done him, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> for Breaking his Word towards him, he told him <Q>“”he would rely no longer on His Friendship, nor should He expect any further Friendship from him, but on the contrary, he would be for ever his Enemy, and
<PB N="27" REF="540"/>
do him all the mischief he could.</Q> The Earl, (who, as many thought, had not been Faulty towards him, was as Great-hearted as He, and thought the very Suspecting him to be an injury Unpardonable) with∣out any reply to the particular, declared <Q>“”that he neither cared for his Friendship,</Q> nor fear'd his Hatred; and from thence avowedly entred into the conversation, and confidence of Those, who were allways awake to Discover, and sollicitous to Pursue any thing, that might prove to his Disadvantage; which was of Evil consequence to the Duke; the Earl be∣ing of the most Ancient of the Nobility, and a man of great Courage, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and of a Family, which had in no time swerv'd from its Fidelity to the Crown.</P>
<P>S<SUP>r</SUP> FRANCIS <HI>Cottington,</HI> who was Secretary to the Prince, and not grown Courtier enough to dissemble his opinion, had given the Duke Of∣fence, before his journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> as is before touch'd upon, and Im∣proved that prejudice after his coming thither, by disposing the Prince all he could to the Marriage of the Infanta; and by his behaviour after his return, in justifying to King <HI>James,</HI> who had a very good opinion of him, the Sincerity of the <HI>Spantard</HI> in the Treaty of the Marriage, <Q>“”that they did intruth desire it, and were fully resolv'd to gratify his Majesty <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in the Business of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and only desired in the Manner of it, to gratify the Emperour, and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> all they could, which would take up very little time.</Q> All which being so Contrary to the Duke's purposes and resolutions, his Displeasure to <HI>Cottington</HI> was sufficiently manifest. And King <HI>James</HI> was no sooner dead, and the new Officers, and Orders made, but the Profits, and Privileges, which had used to be continued to him, who had been Secretary, till some other Promotion, were all retrench'd. And when he was one morning Attend∣ing in the Privy lodgings, as he accustom'd to do, one of the Secre∣taries of State came to him, and told him, <Q>“”that it was the King's Plea∣sure,</Q> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> he should no more presume to come into those Rooms; (which was the first instance, he had receiv'd of the King's Disfavour) and at the same instant the Duke entred into that Quarter: S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Francis Cotting∣ton</HI> address'd himself towards him, and desired <Q>“”he would give him leave to speak to him;</Q> upon which the Duke inclining his ear, moved to a window from the Company; and the other told him, <Q>“”that he receiv'd every day fresh Marks of his Severity;</Q> mention'd the Message, which had been then deliver'd to him, and desired only to know, <Q>“”Whether it could not be in his power, by all dutyful Application, and all possible Service, to be restored to the good Opinion, his Grace had once vouch∣safed <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to have of him,</Q> and to be admitted to Serve him? The Duke heard him, without the least commotion, and with a countenance se∣rene enough, and then answer'd him, <Q>“”That he would deal very clear∣ly with him, that it was utterly Impossible to bring that to pass, which he had Proposed: That he was not only firmly resolv'd Never to trust him, or to have to do with him, but that he was, and would be allways his declared Enemy: and that he would do allways, whatsoever should be in his power to Ruin and Destroy him, and of this he might be most assured:</Q> without mentioning any particular ground for his so heightned Displeasure.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> THE Other very Calmly replied to him (as he was Master of an in∣comparable Temper) <Q>“”That since he was resolv'd Never to do him Good, he hoped from his Justice, and Generosity, that he would not suffer himself to Gain by his Loss; That he had laid out, by his command,
<PB N="28" REF="550"/>
so much money for Jewels, and Pictures, which he had receiv'd: and that, in hope of his future Favour, he had once presented a Suit of Hangings to him, which cost him 800', which he hoped he would cause to be restored to him, and that he would not let him be so great a Looser by him. The Duke answer'd, "he was in the right; that he should the next morning go to <HI>Oliver</HI> (who was his Receiver) and give him a particular account of all the Money due to him, and he should presently pay him;</Q> which was done the next morning accordingly, without the least abatement of any of his demands.</P>
<P>AND he was so far Reconciled to him before his death, that being re∣solv'd <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to make Peace with <HI>Spain,</HI> to the end he might more vigorously pursue the War with <HI>France</HI> (to which his heart was most passionately fix'd) he sent for <HI>Cottington</HI> to come to him, and after conference with him, told him, <Q>“”the King would send him Embassadour thither, and that he should attend him at <HI>Portsmouth</HI> for his Dispatch.</Q></P>
<P>HIS single Misfortune was (which indeed was productive of many greater) that he never made a noble, and a worthy Friendship with a man so near his equal, that he would frankly advise him for his Honour, and true Interest, against the current, or rather the torrent of his Impe∣tuous Passions; which was partly the Vice of the Time, when the Court <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> was not replenish'd with great choice of Excellent Men; and partly the Vice of the Persons, who were most worthy to be applied to, and look'd upon his Youth, and his Obscurity before his Rise, as Obligations upon him to gain their Friendships by extraordinary Application. Then his Ascent was so quick, that it seem'd rather a Flight than a Growth, and he was such a Darling of Fortune, that he was at the Top, before he was well seen at the Bottom; and as if he had been Born a Favourite, he was Supreme the first Month he came to Court; and it was want of confi∣dence, not of credit, that he had not all at first, which he obtain'd after∣wards; never meeting with the least Obstruction from his Setting out, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> till he was as Great as he could be: So that he wanted Dependants be∣fore he thought he could want Coadjutors. Nor was he very Fortunate in the election of those Dependants, very few of his Servants having been ever qualified enough to Assist or Advise him; and they were intent only upon growing Rich under him, not upon their Master's growing Good, as well as Great: Insomuch as he was throughout his Fortune a much Wiser man, than any Servant of Friend he had.</P>
<P>LET the Fault or Misfortune be what, or whence it will, it may reasonably be believ'd that if he had been bless'd with One Faithful Friend, who had been qualified with Wisdom and Integrity, that great <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Person would have committed as few Faults, and done as transcendent worthy Actions, as any Man, who shined in such a Sphere in that Age in <HI>Europe.</HI> For he was of an excellent Disposition, and of a Mind very capable of Advice and Counsel: He was in his Nature just and candid, liberal, generous, and bountiful; nor was it ever known, that the temptation of Money sway'd him to do an unjust, or unkind thing. And though he left a very great Estate to his Heirs; considering the vast For∣tune he inherited by his Wife, the sole Daughter, and Heir of <HI>Francis</HI> Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> he owed no part of it to his Own Industry, or Sollici∣tation; but to the Impatient Humour of two Kings his Masters, who <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> would make his Fortune equal to his Titles, and the one as much above other men, as the other was. And he consider'd it no otherwise than as Theirs, and left it at his death engaged for the Crown, allmost to the value of it, as is touch'd upon before.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="560"/>
IF he had an immoderate Ambition, with which he was charged, and is a Weed (if it be a Weed) apt to grow in the best Soils; it doth not ap∣pear that it was in his Nature, or that he brought it with him to the Court, but rather found it there, and was a Garment necessary for that Air. Nor was it more in his power to be without Promotion, and Titles and Wealth, than for a healthy man to sit in the Sun, in the brightest Dog-days, and remain without any warmth. He needed no Ambition, who was so seated in the hearts of two Such Masters.</P>
<P>THERE are Two particulars, which ly heaviest upon his Memory, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> either of them aggravated by Circumstances very important, and which administer frequent occasions by their Effects to be remember'd.</P>
<P>THE First, his Engaging his old unwilling Master and the Kingdom in the War with <HI>Spain</HI> (not to mention the bold Journey thither, or the Breach of that Match) in a time when the Crown was so poor, and the People more inclined to a bold enquiry, How it came to be so, than duty∣ful to provide for its Supply: and this only upon Personal animosities be∣tween Him, and the Duke of <HI>Olivarez,</HI> the sole Favourite in that Court, and those animosities from very Trivial provocations, which flowed in∣deed from no other Fountain, than that the Nature and Education of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Spain</HI> restrain'd men from that Gayety, and Frolique humour, to which the Prince's Court was more inclined. And <HI>Olivarez</HI> had been heard to Censure very severely the Duke's Familiarity, and Want of Respect to∣wards the Prince (a Crime monstrous to the <HI>Spaniard)</HI> and had said, that <Q>“”if the Infanta did not, as soon as she was married, Suppress that Li∣cence,</Q> she would her Self quickly undergo the Mischief of it: Which gave the first alarum to the Duke to apprehend his own Rum in that Union, and accordingly to use all his endeavours to Break and Prevent it: and from that time he took all occasions to Quarrel with, and Reproach the Conde Duke.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> ONE morning the King desired the Prince to take the Air, and to visit a little House of Pleasure he had (the <HI>Prado)</HI> four miles from <HI>Ma∣dri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> standing in a Forrest, where he used sometimes to Hunt; and the Duke not being ready, the King and the Prince and the Infante Don <HI>Car∣los</HI> went into the Coach, the King likewise calling the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> in∣to that Coach to assist them in their Conversation, the Prince then not Speaking any <HI>Spanish;</HI> and left <HI>Olivarez</HI> to follow in the Coach with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> When the Duke came, they went into the Coach, accompanied with Others of both Nations, and proceeded very cheerful∣ly towards the overtaking the King; but when upon the way he heard, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> was in the Coach with the King, he broke out into a great Passion, reviled the Conde Duke as the Contriver of the Af∣front, reproach'd the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> for his Presumption, in taking the Place, which in all respects belong'd to Him, who was joyn'd with him as Embassadour extraordinary, and came last from the Presence of his Master, and resolv'd to go out of the Coach and to return to <HI>Madrid. Olivarez</HI> easily discover'd by the disorder, and the noise, and the tone, that the Duke was very Angry, without comprehending the Cause of it; Only found that the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> was often named with Such a tone, that he begun to suspect what in truth might be the cause. And there∣upon <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> he commanded a Gentleman, who was on Horseback, with all speed to overtake the King's Coach, and desire that it might stay; intimating that the Duke had taken some Displeasure, the ground whereof was not enough understood. Upon which the King's Coach stay'd, and when the
<PB N="30" REF="570"/>
other approach'd within distance, the Conde Duke alighted, and ac∣quainted the King with what he had observ'd, and what he conceiv'd. The King himself alighted; made great Compliments to the Duke, the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> Excusing himself upon the King's Command, that he should serve as Interpreter. In in end Don <HI>Carlos</HI> went into the Coach with the Favourite, and the Duke and the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> went with the King, and the Prince; and so they prosecuted their journey, and after Dinner return'd in the same manner to <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>THIS with all the Circumstances of it administred wonderful occa∣sion of Discourse in the Court and Country, there having never been <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> such a Comet seen in that Hemisphere; their submiss Reverence to their Princes being a vital part of their Religion.</P>
<P>THERE were very few days pass'd afterwards, in which there was not some manifestation of the highest Displeasure, and Hatred in the Duke against the Earl of <HI>Bristol.</HI> And when the Conde Duke had some eclaircisment with the Duke, in which he made all the Protestations of his sincere Affection, and his desire to maintain a clear, and faithful Friend∣ship with him, which he conceiv'd might be, in some degree, useful to both their Masters; the Other receiv'd his Protestations with all Con∣tempt, and declared, with a very unnecessary frankness, <Q>“”that he would <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> have no Friendship with him.</Q></P>
<P>THE next day after the King return'd from accompanying the Prince towards the Sea, where, at parting, there were all possible demonstra∣tions of mutual Affection between them; the King caused a fair Pillar to be erected in the Place, where they Last embraced each other, with Inscriptions of great Honour to the Prince; there being then in that Court not the least Suspicion, or Imagination, that the Marriage would not Succeed. Insomuch that afterwards, upon the news from <HI>Rome</HI> that the Dispensation was granted, the Prince having left the Desponsorios in the hands of the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> in which the Infante Don <HI>Carlos</HI> was <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> constituted the Prince's Proxy to Marry the Infanta on his behalf; She was treated as Princess of <HI>Wales,</HI> the Queen gave her place, and the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Embassadour had frequent Audiences, as with his Mistriss, in which he would Not be cover'd: Yet, I say, the very next day after the Prince's departure from the King, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Clark,</HI> one of the Prince's Bedchamber, who had formerly serv'd the Duke, was sent back to <HI>Madrid,</HI> upon Pre∣tence that somewhat was forgotten there, but, in Truth, with orders to the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> not to deliver the Desponsorios (which, by the Articles, he was obliged to do, within fifteen days after the arrival of the Dispensation) until he should receive further orders from the Prince, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> or King, after his Return into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>M<SUP>r</SUP> CLARK was not to deliver this Letter to the Embassadour, till he was sure the Dispensation was come; of which he could not be adver∣tised in the instant. But he lodging in the Embassadours house, and fall∣ing sick of a Calenture, which the Physicians thought would prove mor∣tal, he sent for the Earl to come to his Bed side, and deliver'd him the Letter before the arrival of the Dispensation, though long after it was known to be granted; upon which all those Ceremonies were perform'd to the Infanta.</P>
<P>BY these Means, and by this Method, this great Affair, upon which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the Eyes of <HI>Christendom</HI> had been so long fix'd, came to be Dissolv'd, without the least mixture with, or contribution from those Amours, which were afterwards so confidently discoursed of. For though the Duke
<PB N="31" REF="580"/>
was naturally carried violently to those Passions, when there was any grace or beauty in the Object, yet the Duchess of <HI>Olivarez,</HI> of whom was the talk, was then a Woman so old, past Children, of so abject a pre∣sence, in a word, so crooked and deform'd, that she could neither tempt his Appetite, nor magnify his Revenge. And whatsoever he did after∣wards in <HI>England</HI> was but <HI>tueri opus,</HI> and to Prosecute the Design he had, upon the Reason and Provocation aforesaid, so long before contrived during his abode in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>THE Other particular, by which he involv'd himself in so many Fa∣tal <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Intricacies, from which he could Never extricate himself, was, his running violently into the War with <HI>France,</HI> without any kind of Pro∣vocation, and upon a Particular Passion very unwarrantable. In his Em∣bassy in <HI>France,</HI> where his Person and Presence was wonderfully ad∣mired, and esteem'd (and in truth it was a Wonder in the eyes of all men) and in which he appear'd with all the Lustre, the Wealth of <HI>England</HI> could adorn him with, and Outshined all the bravery that Court could dress it self in, and Overacted the whole Nation in their own most pe∣culiar Vanities: He had the Ambition to fix his Eyes upon, and to de∣dicate his most violent Affection to a Lady of a very sublime Quality, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and to pursue it with most importunate Addresses; Insomuch as when the King had brought the Queen his Sister, as far as he meant to do, and deliver'd her into the hands of the Duke, to be by him conducted into <HI>England;</HI> the Duke, in his journey, after the departure from that Court, took a resolution once more to make a Visit to that great Lady, which he believ'd he might do with much privacy. But it was so easily dis∣cover'd, that Provision was made for his Reception; and if he had pur∣sued his Attempt, he had been without doubt Assassinated; of which he had only so much notice, as serv'd him to decline the Danger. But he Swore, in the instant, <Q>“”that he would See, and Speak with that Lady, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in Spight of the Strength and Power of <HI>France.</HI></Q> And from the time that the Queen arrived in <HI>England,</HI> he took all the ways he could to Un∣dervalue and Exasperate that Court and Nation, by causing all Those, who fled into <HI>England</HI> from the justice and displeasure of that King, to be receiv'd and entertain'd here, not only with ceremony and security, but with bounty and magnificence; and the more extraordinary the Persons were, and the more notorious their King's displeasure was to∣wards them (as in that time there were very many Lords, and Ladys in those circumstances) the more respectfully they were receiv'd, and esteem'd. He omitted no opportunity to Incense the King against <HI>France,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and to dispose him to assist the Hugonots, whom he likewise encouraged to give their King some trouble.</P>
<P>AND which was Worse than all this, he took great pains to Lessen the King's Affection towards his young Queen, being exceedingly jealous, lest Her Interest might be of force enough to Cross his other Designs: And in this Stratagem, he so far swerv'd from the Instinct of his Nature, and his proper Inclinations, that He who was compounded of all the ele∣ments of Affability, and Courtesy towards all kind of People, had brought himself to a habit of Neglect, and even of Rudeness towards the Queen.</P>
<P>ONE day, when he unjustly apprehended, that She had shewed some <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> disrespect to his Mother, in not going to her Lodging at an hour she had intended to go, and was hindred by a meer accident; he came into her Chamber in much Passion, and, after some Expostulations rude enough, he told her, <HI>She should Repent it;</HI> her Majesty answering with some
<PB N="32" REF="590"/>
quickness, he replied Insolently to her, <HI>that there had been Queens in</HI> England, <HI>who had lost their Heads.</HI> And it was universally known, that, during His life, the Queen never had any Credit with the King, with reference to any Publick Affairs, and so could not Divert the Reso∣lution of making a War with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THE War with <HI>Spain</HI> had found the Nation in a Surfeit of a long Peace, and in a disposition Inclinable enough to war with That nation, which might put an end to an Alliance the most ungrateful to them, and which they most fear'd, and from whence no other Damage had yet be∣fall'n them, than a Chargeable and Unsuccesful Voyage by Sea, without <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the loss of Ships or Men. But a War with <HI>France</HI> must be carried on at another rate, and expence. Besides, the Nation was weary and surfeited with the First, before the Second was entred upon; and it was very visi∣ble to Wise men, that when the general Trade of the Kingdom, from whence the Support of the Crown principally resulted, should be utterly extinguish'd with <HI>France,</HI> as it was with <HI>Spain,</HI> and interrupted or ob∣structed with all other Places (as it must be in a great measure, in a War, how Prosperously soever carried on) the Effects would be very Sad, and Involve the King in many Perplexities; and it could not but fall out accordingly. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>UPON the return from <HI>Cales</HI> without success, though all the Ships, and, upon the matter, all the Men were seen (for though some had so surfeited in the Vineyards, and with the Wines, that they had been left behind, the Generosity of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sent them all home again) and though by that Fleet's putting in at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> near two hundred miles from <HI>London,</HI> there could be but very Imperfect relations, and the news of Yesterday was contradicted by the Morrow; besides that the Expe∣dition had been undertaken by the Advice of the Parliament, and with an universal Approbation of the People, so that nobody could reasonably speak loudly against it; Yet, notwithstanding all this, the Ill Success was <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> heavily born, and imputed to Ill Conduct, the principal Officers of the Fleet and Army divided amongst themselves, and All united in their murmurs against the General, the Lord Viscount <HI>Wimbledon;</HI> who, though an old Officer in <HI>Holland,</HI> was never thought equal to the En∣terprise. In a word, there was Indisposition enough quickly discover'd against the War it self, that it was easily discern'd, it would not be pur∣sued with the vigour, it was entred into, nor carried on by any cheerful contribution of money from the Publick.</P>
<P>BUT the running into this War with <HI>France</HI> (from whence the Queen was so newly, and joyfully receiv'd) without any colour of Reason, or <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> so much as the formality of a Declaration from the King, containing the ground, and provocation, and end of it, according to custom and obliga∣tion in the like cases (for it was observ'd, that the Manifesto which was publish'd was in the Duke's own Name, who went Admiral and General of the Expedition) opened the mouthes of all men, to Inveigh against it with all Bitterness: and the suddain Ill Effects of it; manifested in the Return of the Fleet to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> within Such a distance of <HI>London,</HI> that nothing could be Conceal'd of the Loss sustain'd; in which, Most no∣ble Families found a Son, or a Brother, or near Kinsman wanting, with∣out such Circumstances of their deaths, as are usually the Consola∣tions, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and Recompenses of such Catastrophes. The Retreat had been a Rout without an Enemy, and the <HI>French</HI> had Their revenge by the Dis∣order, and Confusion of the <HI>English</HI> Themselves; in which, great num∣bers
<PB N="33" REF="600"/>
of Noble and Ignoble were crowded to death, or drowned without the help of an Enemy: and as some thousands of the Common men were wanting, so few of those Principal officers, who attain'd to a Name in War, and by whose Courage and Experience any war was to be con∣ducted, could be found.</P>
<P>THE effects of this overthrow did not at first appear in whispers, murmurs, and invectives, as the retreat from <HI>Cales</HI> had done; but pro∣duced such a general Consternation over the face of the whole Nation, as if all the armys of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> were united together, and had <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> cover'd the land. Mutinies in the Fleet and Army, under pretence of their want of Pay (whereof no doubt there was much due to them) but in truth, out of detestation of the Service, and the Authority of the Duke. The Counties throughout the Kingdom were so incensed, and their affections poison'd, that they refused to suffer the Soldiers to be billetted upon them; by which, they often underwent greater incon∣veniencies and mischiefs, than they endeavour'd to prevent. The en∣deavour to raise new men for the recruit of the Army, by Pressing (the usual method, that had commonly been practised upon such occasions) found opposition in many places; and the Authority by which it was <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> done not submitted to, as being counted illegal. This produced a resort to Martial Law, by which many were executed; which raised an aspe∣rity in the minds of more than of the common people. And this distem∣per was so universal, that the least spark still meeting with combustible matter enough to make a flame; all wise men look'd upon it as the Pre∣diction of the Destruction, and Dissolution, that would follow. Nor was there a Serenity in the Countenance of any man, who had age and expe∣rience enough to consider things to come; but only in those who wish'd the destruction of the Duke; and thought it could not be purchased at too dear a price; and look'd upon this flux of humours as an inevitable <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> way to bring it to pass.</P>
<P>AND it cannot be denied, that from these two Wars so wretchedly entred into, and the circumstances before mention'd, and which flowed from thence, the Duke's ruin took its date; and never left pursuing him, till that execrable act upon his person: the malice whereof was contracted by that sole evil Spirit of the time, without any partner in the Conspi∣racy. And the Venome of That season increased and got vigour; un∣till, from one Licence to another, it proceeded till the Nation was cor∣rupted to that monstrous degree, that it grew Satiated, and weary of the Government it self; under which it had enjoy'd a greater measure of Fe∣licity, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> than any Nation was ever possess'd of; and which could never be continued to them, but under the same Government. And as these cala∣mities Originally sprung from the Inordinate appetite and passion of this young man, under the too much Easiness of two indulgent Masters, and the concurrence of a thousand other accidents; So, if he had liv'd longer, the observation and experience he had gain'd, which had very much im∣proved his Understanding, with the Greatness of his spirit, and Jealousy of his Master's honour (to whom his Fidelity was Superior to any tem∣ptation) might have repair'd many of the Inconveniencies, which he had introduced, and would have prevented the Mischiefs which were <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the natural effects of those causes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An account of a Prediction of the Duke's death.</NOTE> THERE were many Stories scatter'd abroad at that time, of several Prophecies, and Predictions of the Duke's untimely and violent death. Amongst the rest there was one, which was upon a better foundation of
<PB N="34" REF="610"/>
credit, than usually such discourses are founded upon. There was an Officer in the King's Wardrobe in <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle, of a good reputation for honesty and discretion, and then about the age of fifty years or more: this man had, in his youth, been bred in a School, in the Parish where S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>George Villiers</HI> the father of the Duke liv'd; and had been much che∣rish'd and obliged, in that season of his age, by the said S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George,</HI> whom afterwards he never saw. About six months before the miserable end of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> about midnight, this man, being in his bed, at <HI>Windsor</HI> where his Office was, and in a very good health, there appear'd to him on the side of his bed, a man of a very venerable aspect, who drew <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the curtains of his bed, and, fixing his eyes upon him, ask'd him, If he knew him. The poor man, half dead with fear, and apprehension, be∣ing ask'd the second time, Whether he remember'd him? and having in that time call'd to his memory the presence of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Villiers,</HI> and the very cloaths he used to wear, in which at that time he seem'd to be ha∣bited, he answer'd him, That he thought him to be that person. He re∣plyed, <Q>“”he was in the right; that he was the same, and that he expected a service from him; which was, that he should go from Him to his son the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and tell him, if he did not somewhat to in∣gratiate himself to the People, or, at least, to abate the extream malice <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> they had against him,</Q> he would be suffer'd to live but a short time. After this discourse he disappear'd; and the poor man, if he had been at all waking, slept very well till morning, when he believ'd all this to be a dream, and consider'd it no otherwise.</P>
<P>THE next night, or shortly after, the same Person appear'd to him again in the same place, and about the same time of the night, with an aspect a little more severe than before; and ask'd him, Whether he had done, as he had required him? and perceiving he had not, gave him very severe reprehensions; told him, <Q>“”he expected more compliance from him; and that if he did not perform his commands, he should <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> enjoy no peace of mind,</Q> but should be allways pursued by him: upon which, he promised him to obey him. But the next morning waking out of a good sleep, though he was exceedingly perplex'd with the lively re∣presentation of all particulars to his memory, he was willing still to per∣swade himself, that he had only dream'd: and consider'd, that he was a person at such a distance from the Duke, that he knew not how to find any admission to his presence; much less had any hope to be believ'd in what he should say. So with great trouble and unquietness, he spent some time in thinking what he should do; and in the end resolv'd to do no∣thing in the matter. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THE same Person appear'd to him the third time with a terrible coun∣tenance, and bitterly reproaching him for not performing what he had promised to do. The poor man had by this time recover'd the courage to tell him, <Q>“”that in truth he had deferr'd the execution of his commands, upon considering, how difficult a thing it would be for him to get any access to the Duke, having acquaintance with no person about him; and if he could obtain admission to him, he should never be able to perswade him, that he was sent in Such a manner; but he should, at best, be thought to be mad, or to be set on and employ'd, by his own or the malice of other men, to abuse the Duke; and so he should be <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> sure to be undone. The Person replyed, as he had done before, "that he should never find rest, till he should perform what He required; and therefore he were better to dispatch it: that the access to his Son
<PB N="35" REF="620"/>
was known to be very easy; and that few men waited long for him; and for the gaining him credit, he would tell him two or three parti∣culars, which he charged him never to mention to any person living, but to the Duke himself; and He should no sooner hear them, but he would believe all the rest he should say:</Q> and so repeating his threats he left him.</P>
<P>IN the morning, the poor man, more confirm'd by the last Appearance, made his journey to <HI>London;</HI> where the Court then was. He was very well known to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ralph Freeman,</HI> one of the Masters of Requests, who <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> had married a Lady that was nearly allyed to the Duke, and was him∣self well receiv'd by him. To him this man went; and though he did not acquaint him with all particulars, he said enough to him to let him see there was somewhat extraordinary in it; and the knowledge he had of the sobriety, and discretion of the man, made the more impression in him. He desired, that, <Q>“”by His means he might be brought to the Duke; to such a place,</Q> and in such a manner, as should be thought fit: affirm∣ing <Q>“”that he had much so say to him; and of such a Nature, as would require much privacy,</Q> and some time and patience in the hearing. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ralph</HI> promised <Q>“”he would speak first with the Duke of him, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> then he should understand his pleasure:</Q> and accordingly, in the first opportunity, he did inform him of the reputation and honesty of the man, and then what he desired, and of all he knew of the matter. The Duke, according to his usual openness and condescension, told him, <Q>“”that he was the next day early to hunt with the King; that his horses should attend him at <HI>Lambeth</HI>-Bridge, where he would land by five of the clock in the morning; and if the man attended him there at that hour, he would walk,</Q> and speak with him, as long as should be necessary. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ralph</HI> carried the man with him the next morning, and presented him to the Duke at his landing; who receiv'd him courteously; and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> walk'd aside in conference near an hour, none but his own Servants be∣ing at that hour in that place; and they and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ralph</HI> at such a distance, that they could not hear a word, though the Duke sometimes spoke, and with great commotion; which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ralph</HI> the more easily observ'd, and per∣ceiv'd, because he kept his eyes allways fix'd upon the Duke; having pro∣cured the conference, upon somewhat he knew there was of extraordi∣nary. And the man told him in his return over the water, <Q>“”that when he mention'd those particulars, which were to gain him credit, the Substance whereof he said he durst not impart to him, the Duke's co∣lour changed, and he swore he could come to that knowledge only by <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the Devil; for that those particulars were known only to himself, and to one person more,</Q> who, he was sure, would never speak of it.</P>
<P>THE Duke pursued his purpose of hunting; but was observ'd to ride all the morning with great pensiveness, and in deep thoughts, without any delight in the exercise he was upon: and before the morning was spent, left the field, and alighted at his Mother's lodgings in <HI>White-hall;</HI> with whom he was shut up for the space of two or three hours; the noise of their discourse frequently reaching the ears of those, who attended in the next rooms: and when the Duke left her, his countenance appear'd full of trouble, with a mixture of anger; a countenance, that was never <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> before observ'd in him, in any conversation with Her, towards whom he had a profound reverence. And the Countess her self (for though she was married to a private Gentleman S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Compton,</HI> she had been created Countess of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> shortly after her Son had first assumed
<PB N="36" REF="630"/>
that Title) was, at the Duke's leaving her, found overwhelm'd in tears, and in the highest agony imaginable. Whatever there was of all this, it is a notorious truth, that when the news of the Duke's Murther (which happen'd within few months after) was brought to his Mother, she seem'd not in the least degree surprised; but receiv'd it as if she had fore∣seen it; nor did afterwards express such a degree of sorrow, as was ex∣pected from such a Mother, for the loss of such a Son.</P>
<P>THIS Digression much longer than it was intended, may not be thought alltogether improper in this Discourse. For as the mention of his Death was very pertinent, in the place, and upon the occasion, it hap∣pen'd <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to be made; so upon that occasion, it seem'd the more reasonable to Digress, upon the Nature, and Character, and Fortune of the Duke; as being the best mirroir to discern the temper, and Spirit of that Age; and the wonderful concurrence of many fatal accidents, to disfigure the Government of two excellent Kings; under whom their Kingdoms in general prosper'd exceedingly; and enjoy'd a longer Peace, a greater Plenty, and in fuller Security, than had been in any former age.</P>

He was a son of the Robe; his Fa∣ther having been a Judge in the Court of the Common Pleas: who took great care to breed him though his first born, in the study of the Com∣mon Law; by which he himself had been promoted to that degree; and in which, in the Society of the Inner Temple, his Son made a nota∣ble progress, by an early eminence in Practice, and Learning; insomuch <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> as he was Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> Sollicitor General, and King's Atturney before he was forty years of age. A rare ascent! All which Offices he discharged with great abilities, and singular reputation of Integrity. In the first year after the death of King <HI>James,</HI> he was advanced to be Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> (the usual advancement from the office of Atturney General) upon the removal of the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln:</HI> who, though a man of great wit, and good Scholastick learning, was ge∣nerally thought so very unequal to the Place, that his Remove was the only recompence and satisfaction, that could be made for his Promotion. And yet it was enough known, that the Disgrace proceeded only from <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the private displeasure of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> The Lord <HI>Coventry</HI> enjoy'd this place with an universal reputation (and sure Justice was ne∣ver better administred) for the space of about sixteen years; even to his
<PB N="37" REF="640"/>
death, some months before he was sixty years of age: which was another important circumstance of his Felicity; that great Office being so slip∣pery, that no man had died in it before, for near the space of forty years. Nor had his Successors, for some time after him, much better fortune. And he himself had use of all his strength, and skill (as he was an excel∣lent Wrestler in this kind) to preserve himself from falling, in two Shocks: the one given him by the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> Lord high Trea∣surer of <HI>England;</HI> the other by the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who had the greatest power over the affections of the King of any man of that time.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> HE was a man of wonderful Gravity, and Wisdom; and understood not only the whole Science, and Mystery of the Law, at least equally with any man, who had ever sate in that place; but had a clear con∣ception of the whole Policy of the Government both of Church and State, which, by the unskilfulness of some well meaning men, justled each the other too much.</P>
<P>HE knew the temper, disposition, and genius of the Kingdom most exactly; saw their Spirits grow every day more sturdy, inquisitive, and impatient: and therefore naturally abhorred all Innovations, which, he foresaw, would produce ruinous effects. Yet many, who stood at a di∣stance, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> thought that he was not active, and stout enough in opposing those Innovations. For though, by his place, he presided in all Publick Councils, and was most sharp-sighted in the Consequence of things; yet he was seldom known to Speak in matters of State, which, he well knew, were, for the most part, concluded, before they were brought to that Publick agitation: never, in forreign affairs; which the vigour of his Judgement could well have comprehended: nor indeed freely in any thing, but what immediately, and plainly concern'd the Justice of the Kingdom; and in that, as much as he could, he procured References to the Judges. Though, in his Nature, he had not only a firm Gravity, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> but a Severity, and even some Morosity; yet it was so happily temper'd, and his Courtesy, and Affability towards all men so transcendent, and so much without affectation, that it marvellously recommended him to all men of all degrees, and he was look'd upon as an excellent Courtier, with∣out receding from the native simplicity of his own manners.</P>
<P>HE had, in the plain way of speaking and delivery, without much ornament of Elocution, a strange power of making himself believ'd, the only justifiable design of Eloquence: so that though he used very frank∣ly to Deny, and would never suffer any man to depart from him, with an opinion that he was inclined to Gratify, when in truth he was not; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> holding that Dissimulation to be the worst of Lying: yet the Manner of it was so gentle, and obliging, and his Condescension such, to Inform the persons whom he could not Satisfy, that few departed from him with ill will, and ill wishes.</P>
<P>BUT then, this happy Temper, and these good Faculties, rather pre∣serv'd him from having many Enemies, and supplied him with some Well-wishers, than furnish'd him with any fast and unshaken Friends: who are allways procured in Courts, by more Ardour, and more vehe∣ment Professions, and Applications, than He would suffer himself to be entangled with. So that he was a man, rather exceedingly Liked, than <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> passionately Loved: insomuch that it never appear'd, that he had any one Friend in the Court, of Quality enough to prevent, or divert any dis∣advantage, he might be exposed to. And therefore it is no wonder, nor to be imputed to Him, that he retired within himself as much as he could;
<PB N="38" REF="650"/>
and stood upon his Defence, without making desperate sallies against growing mischiefs; which, he knew well, he had no power to hinder, and which might probably begin in his own Ruin. To conclude; his Se∣curity consisted very much in his having but little credit with the King; and he Died, in a season most opportune, in which a wise man would have pray'd to have finish'd his course, and which in truth crown'd his other signal prosperity in the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Lord Treasurer <HI>Weston,</HI> Earl of <HI>Portland.</HI></NOTE> SIR <HI>Richard Weston</HI> had been advanced to the White-staff, into the office of Lord high Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> some months before the death of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> and had, in that short time, so much dis∣obliged <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> him, at least disappointed his expectation, that many, who were privy to the Duke's most secret purposes, did believe, that if he had out∣liv'd that voyage in which he was engaged, he would have remov'd him, and made another Treasurer. And it is very true, that great Office too had been very slippery, and not fast to those, who had trusted themselves in it: Insomuch as there were at that time, five Noble persons alive, who had all Succeeded one another immediately in that unsteady Charge, without any other person intervening: the Earl of <HI>Suffolk;</HI> the Lord Viscount <HI>Mandevile,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Manchester;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Mid∣dlesex;</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who was removed under pretence <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of his age, and disability for the work (which had been a better reason against his Promotion, so few years before, that his infirmities were very little increased) to make room for the present Officer; who, though Ad∣vanced by the Duke, may properly be said to be Establish'd by his Death.</P>
<P>HE was a Gentleman of a very ancient extraction by Father and Mo∣ther. His Education had been very good amongst books and men. Af∣ter some years study of the Law in the Middle Temple, he travel'd into Forreign parts, and at an age fit to make Observations, and Reflections; out of which, that, which is commonly call'd Experience, is constituted. After this he betook himself to the Court, and liv'd there some years; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> at that distance, and with that awe, as was agreeable to the Modesty of the age, when men were Seen some time, before they were Known; and well known before they were Preferred, or durst pretend to it.</P>
<P>HE spent the best part of his Fortune (a fair one, that he inherited from his Father) in his attendance at Court; and involv'd his Friends in Securities with him, who were willing to run his hopeful fortune, be∣fore he receiv'd the least Fruit from it, but the Countenance of great men, and those in authority, the most natural, and most certain Stairs to ascend by.</P>
<P>HE was then sent Embassadour to the Arch-Dukes, <HI>Albert</HI> and <HI>Isa∣bella,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> into <HI>Flanders;</HI> and to the Dyet in <HI>Germany,</HI> to treat about the restitution of the <HI>Palatinate;</HI> in which Negotiation he behaved him∣self with great Prudence, and with the concurrent testimony of his be∣ing a Wise man, from all those Princes and Embassadours, with whom he treated.</P>
<P>UPON his return he was made a Privy Counsellor, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the place of the Lord <HI>Brooke,</HI> who was either per∣swaded, or put out of the place; which, being an office of Honour and Trust, is likewise an excellent Stage for men of parts to tread, and expose themselves upon; where they have occasions of all kinds to lay out, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> spread all their Faculties and Qualifications, most for their advantage. He behaved himself very well in this Function, and appear'd Equal to it; and carried himself so luckily in Parliament, that he did his Master much
<PB N="39" REF="660"/>
Service, and preserv'd himself in the good opinion, and acceptation of the House; which is a blessing not indulged to many by those High Powers. He did swim in those troubled and boisterous waters, in which the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> rode as Admiral, with a good grace; when very many who were about him, were drowned, or forced on shore with shrewd hurts, and bruises: which shewed, he knew well How and When to use his limbs, and strength to the best advantage; sometimes only to avoid sinking; and sometimes to Advance and get ground: and by this dexterity, he kept his credit with those who could do him good, and lost <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> it not with others, who desired the destruction of those upon whom he most depended.</P>
<P>HE was made Lord Treasurer in the manner, and at the time men∣tion'd before, upon the removal of the Earl of <HI>Malborough,</HI> and few months before the death of the Duke. The former circumstance, which is often attended by Compassion towards the Degraded, and Prejudice to∣wards the Promoted, brought him no disadvantage: For besides the de∣light that Season had in Changes, there was little reverence towards the Person removed; and the extream visible Poverty of the Exchequer shel∣ter'd that Province from the Envy, it had frequently created; and open'd <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> a door, for much Applause to be the portion of a wise, and provident Minister. For the other, of the Duke's death, though some, who knew the Duke's passions, and prejudice (which often produced rather suddain indisposition, than obstinate resolution) believ'd he would have been shortly cashier'd, as so many had lately been; and so that the death of his Founder was a greater Confirmation of him in the Office, than the delivery of the White-staff to him had been: yet many other wise men, who knew the Treasurer's talent in removing prejudice, and reconciling himself to wavering and doubtful affections, believ'd, that the Loss of the Duke was very Unseasonable; and that the aw, or apprehension of His <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> power, and displeasure, was a very necessary alloy for the Impetuosity of the new Officer's nature, which needed some restraint, and check, for some time, to his immoderate Pretences, and appetite of Power.</P>
<P>HE did indeed appear on the suddain wonderfully Elated, and so far threw off his old affectation to please Some very much, and to displease None, in which art he had excell'd; that in few months after the Duke's death, he found himself to succeed him in the publick displeasure, and in the malice of his Enemies, without succeeding him in his credit at Court, or in the affection of any considerable Dependents. And yet, though he was not superiour to all other men in the affection, or rather <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> resignation of the King, so that he might dispense favours, and disfavours according to his own election; he had a full share in his Master's esteem, who look'd upon him as a wise, and able Servant, and worthy of the trust he reposed in him; and receiv'd no other advice in the large busi∣ness of his Revenue: nor was any man so much his superiour, as to be able to lessen him in the King's affection by his power. So that he was in a Post, in which he might have found much ease, and delight, if he could have contain'd himself within the verge of his own Province, which was large enough, and of such Extent, that he might, at the same time, have drawn a great dependance upon him of very considerable men, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and have appear'd a very useful, and profitable Minister to the King; whose Revenue had been very loosely managed during the late years, and might, by industry, and order, have been easily improved: and no man better understood what method was necessary towards that good husban∣dry, than he.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="670"/>
BUT I know not by what frowardness in his Stars, he took more pains in examining, and inquiring into Other Mens offices, than in the dis∣charge of his Own; and not so much joy in what he Had, as trouble, and agony for what he had Not. The truth is, he had so vehement a desire to be the sole Favourite, that he had no relish of the power, he had: and in that contention he had many Rivals, who had credit enough to do him Ill offices, though not enough to satisfy their own Ambition; the King himself being resolv'd to hold the Reins in his own hands, and to put no further trust in others, than was necessary for the Capacity they serv'd in. Which Resolution in his Majesty was no sooner believ'd, and the Trea∣surer's <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Pretence taken notice of, than he found the number of his Ene∣mies exceedingly increased, and others to be less eager in the pursuit of his Friendship; and every day discover'd some Infirmities in him, which being before known to few, and not taken notice of, did now expose him both to publick Reproach, and to private Animosities: and even his Vices admitted those contradictions in them, that he could hardly enjoy the pleasant fruit of any of them. That which first exposed him to the publick jealousy, which is allways attended with publick reproach, was the concurrent suspicion of his Religion. His Wife, and all his Daughters were declared of the Roman Religion: and though He himself, and his <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Sons, sometimes went to Church, he was never thought to have Zeal for it; and his Domestick conversation and dependents, with whom only he used entire freedom, were all known Papists▪ and were believ'd to be Agents for the rest. And yet with all this disadvantage to himself, he ne∣ver had reputation, and credit with that Party; who were the only peo∣ple of the Kingdom, who did not believe him to be of their Profession. For the Penal Laws (those only excepted which were Sanguinary, and even those sometimes let loose) were never more rigidly executed, nor had the Crown ever so great a Revenue from them, as in his time; nor did they ever pay so dear for the favours, and indulgencies of his office <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> towards them.</P>
<P>No man had greater ambition to make his Family great, or stronger designs to leave a great Fortune to it. Yet his Expences were so prodi∣gious, especially in his House, that all the ways he used for supply, which were all, that occurr'd, could not serve his turn; insomuch that he contracted so great Debts (the anxiety whereof, he pretended, broke his mind, and restrain'd that attention, and industry, which was necessa∣ry for the due execution of his Office) that the King was pleased Twice to pay his Debts; at least towards it, to disburse forty thousand pounds in ready money out of his Exchequer. Besides, his Majesty gave him <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> a whole Forrest [<HI>Chute</HI> Forrest in <HI>Hampshire]</HI> and much other land be∣longing to the Crown; which was the more taken notice of, and Mur∣mur'd against, because, being the chief Minister of the Revenue, he was particularly obliged, as much as in him lay, to prevent, and even oppose such Disinherison; and because, under that obligation, he had avowedly, and sowrly cross'd the pretences of other men, and restrain'd the King's Bounty from being exercised allmost to any. And he had that advan∣tage (if he had made the right use of it) that his Credit was ample enough (seconded by the King's own experience, and observation, and inclina∣tion) to Retrench very much of the late unlimited Expences, and espe∣cially <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> those of Bounties; which from the death of the Duke ran in nar∣rower channels, and never so much overflow'd as towards himself, who stopp'd the current to other men.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="680"/>
HE was of an imperious nature, and nothing wary in disobliging and provoking other men, and had too much courage in offending and in∣censing them: but after having offended and incensed them, he was of so unhappy a feminine temper, that he was allways in a terrible fright and apprehension of them.</P>
<P>HE had not that application, and submission, and reverence for the Queen, as might have been expected from his wisdom and breeding; and often cross'd her pretences and desires, with more rudeness than was natural to him. Yet he was impertinently sollicitous to know what her <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Majesty said of him in private, and what Resentments she had towards him. And when by some Confidents who had their ends upon him from those offices, he was inform'd of some bitter expressions fall'n from her Majesty, he was so exceedingly afflicted, and tormented with the sense of it, that sometimes by passionate complaints, and representations to the King; sometimes by more dutiful addresses, and expostulations with the Queen, in bewailing his misfortune; he frequently exposed himself, and left his condition worse than it was before; and the eclaircisment commonly ended in the discovery of the persons, from whom he had receiv'd his most secret intelligence.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> HE quickly lost the character of a bold, stout, and magnanimous man, which he had been long reputed to be in worse times: and, in his most prosperous season, fell under the reproach of being a man of big looks, and of a mean, and abject spirit.</P>
<P>THERE was a very ridiculous Story at that time in the mouths of many, which, being a known truth, may not be unfitly mention'd in this place, as a kind of illustration of the Humour, and Nature of the man. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> was then Master of the Rolls, and had, inherent in his office, the indubitable right and disposition of the Six-Clarks places; all which he had for many years, upon any vacancy, bestow'd to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> such persons as he thought fit. One of those Places was become void, and design'd by the old man to his son <HI>Robert Caesar,</HI> a Lawyer of a good name, and exceedingly beloved. The Lord Treasurer (as he was vigilant in such cases) had notice of the Clark's expiration so soon, that he pro∣cured the King to send a message to the Master of the Rolls, expresly for∣bidding him to dispose of that Six-Clark's place, till his Majesty's pleasure should be further made known to him. It was the first Command of that kind, that had been heard of, and was felt by the old man very Sen∣sibly. He was indeed very old, and had outliv'd most of his Friends; so that his Age was an objection against him; many Persons of Quality be∣ing <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> dead, who had, for recompence of Services, procured the reversion of his Office. The Treasurer found it no hard matter so far to terrify him, that (for the King's service as was pretended) he admitted for a Six-Clark a person recommended by him (M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Fern</HI> a dependant upon him) who #aid six thousand pound ready money; which, poor man! he liv'd to re∣pent in a Jayl. This work being done at the charge of the poor old man, who had been a Privy-Counsellor from the entrance of King <HI>James,</HI> had been Chancellor of the Exchequer, and serv'd in other Offices; the depriving him of his Right made a great noise: and the condition of his Son (his Father being not likely to live to have the disposal of another <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> office in his power) who, as was said before, was generally belov'd, and esteem'd, was argument of great compassion; and was lively, and suc∣cessfully represented to the King himself; who was graciously pleased to promise, that, "if the old man chanced to die before any other of the
<PB N="43" REF="690"/>
Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in Marriage to the eldest Son) could not make him think himself Great enough. Nor could all the King's Bounties, nor his own large Accessions, raise a Fortune to his Heir; but after six or eight years spent in outward opulency, and inward murmur and trouble, that it was not greater; after vast summs of money and great wealth gotten, and rather consumed than enjoy'd; without any sense or delight in so great Prosperity▪ with the agony that it was no greater; He Died unla∣mented by Any; bitterly mention'd by Most who never pretended to love him; and severely censured, and complain'd of by Those, who ex∣pected <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> most from him, and deserv'd best of him; and left a numerous Fa∣mily, which was in a short time worn out, and yet outliv'd the Fortune he left behind him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Earl of <HI>Manchester ,</HI> Lord Privy Seal.</NOTE> THE next great Counsellor of State was the Lord Privy-Seal, who was likewise of a Noble extraction, and of a Family at that time very fortunate. His Grandfather had been Lord Chief Justice, and left by King <HI>Harry</HI> the Eighth one of the Executors of his last Will. He was the younger Son of his Father, and brought up in the study of the Law in the Middle Temple; and had pass'd, and, as it were, made a progress through all the eminent Degrees of the Law, and in the State. At the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> death of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> or thereabouts, he was Recorder of <HI>London;</HI> then the King's Serjeant at Law; afterwards Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Before the death of King <HI>James,</HI> by the Favour of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> he was raised to the Place of Lord High Treasurer of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> and within less than a year afterwards, by the withdrawing of that Favour, he was reduced to the allmost empty Title of President of the Council; and, to allay the sense of the dishonour, created Viscount <HI>Mandevile.</HI> He bore the Diminution very well, as he was a wise man, and of an excellent temper; and quickly recover'd so much grace, that he was made Earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> and Lord Privy-Seal, and enjoy'd <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that Office to his death; whilst he saw many Removes, and Degrada∣tions, in all the other Offices of which he had been possess'd.</P>
<P>HE was a man of great Industry, and Sagacity in Business, which he delighted in exceedingly; and preserv'd so great a vigour of Mind, even to his death (when he was very near eighty years of age) that some, who had known him in his younger years, did believe him to have much quicker Parts in his age, than before. His Honours had grown saster upon him than his Fortunes; which made him too sollicitous to ad∣vance the latter, by all the ways which offer'd themselves; whereby he exposed himself to some inconvenience, and many reproaches, and be∣came <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> less capable of serving the Publick by his Counsels, and Authority; which his known wisdom, long experience, and confess'd gravity, and ability, would have enabled him to have done; most men considering more the Person that speaks, than the Things he says. And he was un∣happily too much used as a Check upon the Lord <HI>Coventry;</HI> and when that Lord perplex'd their counsels, and designs, with inconvenient ob∣jections in Law, the Authority of the Lord <HI>Manchester</HI> who had trod the same paths, was still call'd upon; and he did too frequently gratify their unjustifiable designs, and pretences▪ a guilt and mischief, all men, who are obnoxious, or who are thought to be so, are liable to, and can hardly pre∣serve <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> themselves from. But his Virtues so far weigh'd down his Infirmi∣ties, that he maintain'd a good general reputation, and credit with the whole Nation, and People; he being allways look'd upon, as full of In∣tegrity, and Zeal to the Protestant Religion, as it was establish'd by Law,
<PB N="44" REF="700" MS="y"/>
and of unquestionable Loyalty, Duty, and Fidelity to the King; which two Qualifications will ever gather popular Breath enough to fill the Sails, if the Vessel be competently provided with Ballast. He Died in a lucky time, in the beginning of the Rebellion, when neither Religion, Loyalty, Law, nor Wisdom could have provided for any man's Security.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Earl of <HI>Arundel.</HI></NOTE> THE Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> was the next Officer of State, who, in his own Right, and Quality, preceded the rest of the Council. He was general∣ly thought to be a proud man, who liv'd allways within himself, and to himself, conversing little with any, who were in common conversation; so that he seem'd to live as it were in another Nation, his House being a <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> place, to which all people resorted who resorted to no other place; Strangers, or such who affected to look like Strangers, and dress'd them∣selves accordingly. He resorted sometimes to the Court, because There only was a greater man than himself; and went thither the seldomer, be∣cause there Was a greater man than himself. He liv'd towards all Fa∣vourites, and great Officers, without any kind of condescension, and ra∣ther suffer'd himself to be ill treated by their power and authority (for he was often in Disgrace, and once or twice Prisoner in the Tower) than to descend in making any application to them.</P>
<P>AND upon these Occasions he spent a great interval of his time in <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> several Journeys into forreign Parts, and, with his Wife and Family, had liv'd some years in <HI>Italy;</HI> the humour, and manners of which Na∣tion he seem'd most to like, and approve, and affected to imitate. He had a good fortune by Descent, and a much greater from his Wife, who was the sole Daughter upon the matter (for neither of the two Sisters left any Issue) of the great House of <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> but his Expences were without any measure, and allways exceeded very much his Revenue. He was willing to be thought a Scholar, and to understand the most my∣sterious parts of Antiquity, because he made a wonderful and costly Pur∣chase of excellent Statues, whilst he was in <HI>Italy,</HI> and in <HI>Rome</HI> (some <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> whereof he could never obtain permission to remove from <HI>Rome,</HI> though he had paid for them) and had a rare Collection of the most curious Me∣dals. As to all parts of Learning he was allmost illiterate, and thought no other part of History so considerable, as what related to his own Fa∣mily; in which, no doubt, there had been some very memorable Per∣sons. It cannot be denied that he had in his person, in his aspect, and countenance, the appearance of a great man, which he preserv'd in his gate, and motion. He wore and affected a Habit very different from that of the time, such as men had only beheld in the Pictures of the most con∣siderable Men; all which drew the eyes of most, and the reverence of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> many towards him, as the Image, and Representative of the Primitive Nobility, and Native Gravity of the Nobles, when they had been most Venerable: but this was only his out-side; his nature and true humour being much disposed to levity, and delights, which indeed were very de∣spicable and childish. He was rather thought not to be much concern'd for Religion, than to incline to this, or that Party of any: and had lit∣tle other affection for the Nation or the Kingdom, than as he had a great share in it, in which like the great Leviathan he might sport himself; from which he withdrew, as soon as he discern'd the repose thereof was like to be disturb'd, and died in <HI>Italy,</HI> under the same doubtful character <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of Religion, in which he liv'd.</P>

most universally belov'd and esteem'd of any man of that age: and, having a great Office in the Court, he made the Court it self better esteem'd, and more reverenced in the Country. And as he had a great number of Friends of the best men, so no man had ever the confidence to avow himself to be his Enemy. He was a man very well bred, and of excellent parts, and a graceful Speaker upon any subject, having a good proportion of Learning, and a ready Wit to apply it, and enlarge upon it: of a pleasant and facetious humour, and a disposition affable, generous, and magnificent. He was master of a great Fortune from his Ancestours, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and had a great addition by his Wife, another Daughter, and Heir of the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> which he enjoy'd during his life, she outliving him: but all serv'd not his Expence, which was only limited by his great mind, and occasions to use it nobly.</P>
<P>HE liv'd many years About the Court, before In it; and never By it: being rather regarded and esteem'd by King <HI>James,</HI> than lov'd and fa∣vour'd. After the foul Fall of the Earl of <HI>Somerset,</HI> he was made Lord Chamberlain of the King's House, more for the Courts sake, than his Own; and the Court appear'd with the more Lustre, because He had the Government of that Province. As he spent and liv'd upon his own For∣tune, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> so he stood upon his own Feet, without any other support than of his proper Virtue and Merit: and liv'd towards the Favourites with that decency, as would not suffer them to censure or reproach his Master's judgement, and election, but as with men of his own rank. He was ex∣ceedingly beloved in the Court, because he never desired to get that for Himself, which Others labour'd for, but was still ready to promote the pretences of worthy men. And he was equally celebrated in the Coun∣try, for having receiv'd no obligations from the Court which might cor∣rupt, or sway his affections, and judgement: so that all who were dis∣pleased, and unsatisfied In the Court, or With the Court, were allways <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> inclined to put themselves under his Banner, if he would have admitted them: and yet he did not so reject them, as to make them choose ano∣ther Shelter, but so far suffer'd them to depend on him, that he could restrain them from breaking out beyond private resentments, and mur∣murs.</P>
<P>HE was a great lover of his Country, and of the Religion, and Justice, which he believ'd could only support it; and his Friendships were only with men of those Principles. And as his Conversation was most with men of the most pregnant parts, and understanding, so towards any such, who needed support, or encouragement, though unknown, if fairly re∣commended <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to him, he was very liberal. Sure never man was planted in a Court, that was fitter for that Soil, or brought better qualities with him to purify that Air.</P>
<P>YET his memory must not be Flatter'd, that his virtues, and good in∣clinations may be Believ'd; he was not without some allay of Vice, and without being clouded with great Infirmities, which he had in too exor∣bitant a proportion. He indulged to himself the Pleasures of all kinds▪ allmost in all excesses. To Women, whether out of his natural constitu∣tion, or for want of his domestick content, and delight (in which he was most unhappy, for he paid much too dear for his Wife's Fortune, by <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> taking her Person into the bargain) he was immoderately given up. But therein he likewise retain'd such a power, and jurisdiction over his very appetite, that he was not so much transported with beauty, and outward allurements, as with those advantages of the mind, as manifested an extra∣ordinary
<PB N="46" REF="720" MS="y"/>
wit, and spirit, and knowledge, and administred great pleasure in the conversation. To these he sacrificed Himself, his precious time, and much of his fortune. And some, who were nearest his trust and friendship, were not without apprehension, that his natural vivacity, and vigour of mind begun to lessen, and decline by those excessive Indul∣gences.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time of the death of King <HI>James,</HI> or presently after, he was made Lord Steward of his Majesty's House; that the Staff of Cham∣berlain might be put into the hands of his Brother, the Earl of <HI>Montgo∣mery,</HI> upon a new contract of Friendship with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> after whose death, he had likewise such Offices of his, as he most affected, of honour and command; none of profit, which he cared not for: and within two years after, he died himself of an Apoplexy, after a full and chearful Supper.</P>
<P>A SHORT Story may not be unfitly inserted, it being very frequent∣ly mention'd by a Person of known integrity, whose Character is here undertaken to be set down, and who, at that time, being on his way to <HI>London,</HI> met at <HI>Maidenhead</HI> some Persons of Quality, of relation or de∣pendence upon the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> (S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Charles Morgan,</HI> commonly call'd General <HI>Morgan,</HI> who had commanded an Army in <HI>Germany,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> defended <HI>Stoad;</HI> D<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Feild,</HI> then Bishop of Saint <HI>Davids;</HI> and D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Chafin,</HI> the Earl's then Chaplain in his house, and much in his favour.) At Sup∣per one of them drank a health to the Lord Steward: upon which ano∣ther of them said, <Q>“”that he believ'd his Lord was at that time very Mer∣ry, for he had now outliv'd the day, which his Tutor <HI>Sandford</HI> had prognosticated upon his Nativity he would not outlive; but he had done it now, for that was his Birth-day, which had compleated his age to fifty years.</Q> The next morning, by the time they came to <HI>Colebrook,</HI> they met with the news of his Death.</P>
<P>HE Died exceedingly lamented by men of all qualities, and left many <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of his Servants and Dependents owners of good Estates, raised out of his employments, and bounty. Nor had his Heir cause to complain. For though his Expences had been very magnificent (and it may be the less consider'd, and his providence the less, because he had no Child to in∣herit) insomuch as he left a great Debt charged upon the Estate; yet considering the wealth he left in Jewels, Plate, and Furniture, and the Estate his Brother enjoy'd in the right of His Wife (who was not fit to manage it her self) during her long life, he may be justly said to have in∣herited as good an Estate from him, as He had from his Father, which was one of the best in <HI>England.</HI> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>

The former being a young man, scarce of age at the entrance of King <HI>James,</HI> had the good fortune by the comeliness of his person, his skill, and indefatigable industry in Hunting, to be the first, who drew the King's eyes towards him with affection; which was quickly so far improved, that he had the reputation of a Favourite. Before the end of the first, or second year, he was made Gentleman of the King's Bed-cham∣ber, and Earl of <HI>Montgomery;</HI> which did the King no harm: For be∣sides <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that he receiv'd the King's Bounty with more moderation than other men, who succeeded him; He was generally known, and as gene∣rally esteem'd; being the Son of one Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and younger Bro∣ther
<PB N="47" REF="730"/>
to another, who liberally supplied his expence, beyond what his annuity from his Father would bear.</P>
<P>HE pretended to no other qualifications, than to understand Horses and Dogs very well, which his Master loved him the better for (being, at his first coming into <HI>England,</HI> very jealous of those who had the repu∣tation of great Parts) and to be believ'd honest and generous, which made him many Friends, and left him then no Enemy. He had not sate many years in that Sun-shine, when a new Comet appear'd in Court, <HI>Robert Carr,</HI> a <HI>Scots</HI>-man, quickly after declared Favourite; upon whom <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the King no sooner fix'd his eyes, but the Earl, without the least mur∣mur, or indisposition, left all doors open for his entrance: (A rare tem∣per! and it could proceed from nothing, but his great perfection in loving Field-sports) which the King receiv'd as so great an Obligation, that he allways after loved him in the Second place, and commended him to his Son at his death, as a man to be relied on in point of Honesty and Fidelity; though it appear'd afterwards, that he was not strongly Built, nor had sufficient Ballast to endure a Storm; of which more will be said hereafter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Dor∣set.</HI></NOTE> THE other, the Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> was, to all intents, principles, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> purposes, another man; his Person beautiful and graceful, and vigorous; his Wit pleasant, sparkling, and sublime; and his other Parts of Learn∣ing, and Language, of that lustre, that he could not miscarry in the world. The Vices he had, were of the Age, which he was not stubborn enough to contemn, or resist. He was a Younger brother, Grandchild to the great Treasurer <HI>Buckhurst,</HI> created, at the King's first Entrance, Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> who outliv'd his Father, and took care, and delight in the Edu∣cation of his Grandchild, and left him a good Support for a Younger brother; besides a Wife, who was Heir to a fair Fortune. As his Person and Parts were such as are before mention'd, so he gave them full scope, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> without restraint; and indulged to his appetite all the Pleasures, that sea∣son of his life (the fullest of jollity, and riot of any, that preceded, or succeeded) could tempt, or suggest to him.</P>
<P>HE entred into a fatal Quarrel, upon a subject very unwarrantable, with a young Nobleman of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Bruce;</HI> upon which they both transported themselves into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and attended only by two Chirurgions placed at a distance, and under an obligation not to stir, but upon the fall of one of them, they Fought under the Walls of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where the Lord <HI>Bruce</HI> fell dead upon the place; and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Sack∣ville</HI> (for so he was then call'd) being likewise hurt, retired into the next <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Monastery, which was at hand. Nor did this miserable accident, which he allways exceedingly lamented, make that through impression upon him, but that he indulged still too much to those importunate, and insa∣tiate appetites, even of that individual Person, that had so lately em∣bark'd him in that desperate enterprize; being too much Tinder not to be inflamed with those Sparks.</P>
<P>HIS Elder brother did not enjoy his Grandfather's Titles many years, before they descended, for want of Heirs male, to the Younger brother. But in these few years the Elder, by an excess of expence in all the ways to which money can be applied, so entirely consumed allmost the whole <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> great Fortune that descended to him, that, when he was forced to leave the Title to his younger Brother, he left upon the matter nothing to him to support it; which exposed him to many difficulties, and inconve∣niencies. Yet his known great Parts, and the very good general Repu∣tation
<PB N="48" REF="740"/>
he had acquired, notwithstanding his defects (for as he was emi∣nent in the House of Commons, whilst he sate there; so he shined in the House of Peers, when he came to move in that sphere) inclined King <HI>James</HI> to call him to his Privy-Council before his death. And if he had not too much cherish'd his natural constitution, and propensity; and been too much griev'd, and wrung by an uneasy and streight Fortune; he would have been an excellent man of business; for he had a very sharp, discerning spirit; and was a man of an obliging nature, much honour, and great generosity, and of most entire fidelity to the Crown.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Earl of <HI>Carlisle.</HI></NOTE> THERE were two other Persons of much Authority in the Council, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> because of great Name in the Court; as they deserv'd to be, being with∣out doubt two as accomplish'd Courtiers, as were found in the Palaces of all the Princes in <HI>Europe;</HI> and the greatest (if not too great) improvers of that Breeding, and those Qualifications, with which Courts used to be adorn'd; the Earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Holland:</HI> both (though men of pleasure) by their long experience in Court well acquainted with the affairs of the Kingdom, and better versed in those abroad, than any other who sat then at that Board.</P>
<P>THE former, a Younger brother of a noble Family in <HI>Scotland,</HI> came into the Kingdom with King <HI>James,</HI> as a Gentleman; under no other <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> character, than a person well qualified by his breeding in <HI>France,</HI> and by study in humane Learning; in which he bore a good part in the enter∣tainment of the King, who much delighted in that exercise: and by these means, and notable gracefulness in his behaviour, and affability, in which he excell'd, he had wrought himself into a particular interest with his Master, and into greater affection and esteem with the whole <HI>English</HI> Nation, than any other of that Country; by choosing Their friendships, and conversation, and really preferring it to any of his Own: Insomuch as upon the King's making him Gentleman of his Bedchamber, and Viscount <HI>Doncaster,</HI> by his Royal mediation (in which office he was a <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> most prevalent Prince) he obtain'd the sole Daughter and Heir of the Lord <HI>Denny</HI> to be given him in marriage; by which he had a fair For∣tune in Land provided for any Issue he should raise, and which his Son by that Lady liv'd long to enjoy.</P>
<P>HE ascended afterwards, and with the expedition he desired, to the other Conveniencies of the Court. He was Groom of the Stole, and an Earl, and Knight of the Garter; and married a beautiful young Lady, Daughter to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> without any other approba∣tion of her Father, or concernment in it, than suffering Him and Her to come into his presence after they were married. He liv'd rather in a fair <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Intelligence than any Friendship with the Favourites; having credit enough with his Master to provide for his own interest, and he troubled not himself for that of other men; and had no other consideration of money, than for the support of his lustre; and whilst he could do that, he cared not for money, having no bowels in the point of running in debt, or borrowing all he could.</P>
<P>HE was surely a man of the greatest expence in his own person, of any in the age he liv'd; and introduced more of that expence in the excess of Cloaths and Diet, than any other man; and was indeed the Original of all those inventions, from which others did but transcribe Copies. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> He had a great universal understanding, and could have taken as much delight in any other way, if he had thought any other as pleasant, and worth his care. But he found Business was attended with more Rivals,
<PB N="49" REF="750"/>
and vexations; and, he thought, with much less pleasure, and not more innocence.</P>
<P>HE left behind him the reputation of a very fine Gentleman, and a most accomplish'd Courtier; and after having spent, in a very jovial life, above four hundred thousand pounds, which, upon a strict compu∣tation, he receiv'd from the Crown, he left not a House, nor Acre of Land to be remember'd by. And when he had in his prospect (for he was very sharp-sighted, and saw as far before him as most men) the gathering together of that Cloud in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which shortly after cover'd both <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Kingdoms, he Died with as much tranquillity of mind to all appearance, as used to attend a man of more severe exercise of Virtue; and with as little apprehension of death, which he expected many days.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was a younger Son of a Noble House, and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Earl of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> very fruitful Bed, which divided a numerous Issue between two great Fathers: the Eldest, many Sons and Daughters to the Lord <HI>Rich;</HI> the Younger, of both Sexes, to <HI>Mountjoy</HI> Earl of <HI>Devonshire.</HI> The reputa∣tion of his Family gave him no great advantage in the world, though his eldest Brother was Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and owner of a great Fortune; and his Younger Earl of <HI>Newport,</HI> of a very plentiful Revenue likewise. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> He, after some time spent in <HI>France,</HI> betook himself to the War in <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> which he intended to have made his Profession; where after he had made two or three Campaigns, according to the custom of the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Voluntiers, he came in the leisure of the Winter to visit his Friends in <HI>England,</HI> and the Court, that shined then in the plenty and bounty of King <HI>James;</HI> and about the time of the infancy of the Duke of <HI>Buc∣kingham</HI>'s favours, to whom he grew in a short time very acceptable. But his Friendship was more entire to the Earl of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> who was more of his nature, and humour, and had a generosity more applicable at that time to his fortune and his ends. And it was thought by many <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> who stood within view, that for some years he supported himself upon the Familiarity, and Friendship of the other; which continued mutual∣ly between them very many years, with little interruption to their death.</P>
<P>HE was a very handsome man, of a lovely, and winning presence, and gentile conversation; by which he got so easy an admission into the Court, and grace of King <HI>James,</HI> that he gave over the thought of fur∣ther intending the life of a Soldier. He took all the ways he could to en∣dear himself to the Duke, and to his confidence, and wisely declined the receiving any grace or favour, but as His donation; above all, avoided <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the suspicion that the King had any kindness for him, upon any account but of the Duke, whose Creature he desired to be esteem'd, though the Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI>'s Friend. And he prosper<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d so well in that Pretence, that the King scarce made more hast to advance the Duke, than the Duke did to promote the other.</P>
<P>HE first prefer'd him to a Wife, the Daughter and Heir of <HI>Cope,</HI> by whom he had a good Fortune; and amongst other things, the Mannor and Seat of <HI>Kensington,</HI> of which he was shortly after made Baron. And he had quickly so entire a confidence in him, that the Duke prevail'd with the King to put him about his Son the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and to be <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> a Gentleman of his Bedchamber, before the Duke himself had reason to promise himself any proportion of his Highness's grace, and protection. He was then made Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> Captain of the Guard, Knight of the Garter, and of the Privy-Council; sent the first Embassadour into <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="760"/>
to treat the marriage with the Queen, or rather privately to treat about the marriage before he was Embassadour. And when the Duke went to the Isle of <HI>Ree,</HI> he trusted the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> with the command of that Army with which He was to be recruited, and assisted.</P>
<P>IN this Confidence, and in this Posture he was left by the Duke when he was kill'd; and having the advantage of the Queens good opinion, and favour (which the Duke neither had, nor cared for) he made all possible approaches towards the obtaining His trust, and succeeding him in His power; or rather that the Queen might have solely that Power, and he only be Subservient to her; and upon this account, he made a continual <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> War upon the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> the Treasurer, and all others who were not gracious to the Queen, or desired not the increase of her Authority. And in this State, and under this Protection he receiv'd every day new Obligations from the King, and great Bounties,and continued to Flourish above any man in the Court, whilst the Weather was fair: but the Storm did no sooner arise, but he changed so much, and declined so fast from the Honour he was thought to be master of, that he fell into that Condition, which there will be hereafter too much cause to mention, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o enlarge upon.</P>

<P>Of these two Secretaries the Former was a man of a very narrow education, and a narrower nature; having continued long in the Uni∣versity of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where he had gotten Latin learning enough; and afterwards in the Country in the condition of a private Gentleman, till a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter he was fifty years of age; when, upon some reputation he had for Industry and Diligence, he was call'd to some painful employment in the office of the Navy, which he discharged well; and afterwards to be Mast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of Requests, and then to be Secretary of State, which he enjoy'd <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to a great age: and was a man rather unadorn'd with any parts of vi∣gour and quickness, and unindow'd with any notable virtues, than noto∣riou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for any weakness or defect of understanding, or transported with any virious inclinations, appetite to Money only excepted. His cardinal perfection was Industry, and his most eminent infirmity Covetousness. His long Experience had inform'd him well of the State and affairs of <HI>England;</HI> but of Forreign transactions, or the common interest of Chri∣stian Princes he was entirely undiscerning, and ignorant.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Dudley Carleton</HI> was of a quite contrary nature, constitution, and education, and understood all that related to Forreign employments, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and the condition of other Princes, and Nations very well; but was un∣acquainted with the Government, Laws, and Customs of his own Coun∣try, and the Nature of the People. He was a Younger son in a good
<PB N="51" REF="770"/>
Gentleman's Family, and bred in <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> in the University of <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he was a Student of the Foundation, and a young man of Parts, and towardly expectation. He went from thence early into <HI>France,</HI> and was soon after Secretary to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Nevil,</HI> the Embassadour there. He had been sent Embassadour to <HI>Venice,</HI> where he resided many years with good reputation; and was no sooner return'd from thence in∣to <HI>England,</HI> than he went Embassadour into <HI>Holland</HI> to the States Ge∣neral, and resided there when that Synod was assembled at <HI>Dort,</HI> which hath given the World so much occasion since for uncharitable Disputa∣tions, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> which They were call'd together to prevent. Here the Embassa∣dour was not thought so equal a Spectator, or Assessor, as he ought to have been; but by the infusions he made into King <HI>James,</HI> and by his own activity, he did all he could to discountenance that Party that was most Learned, and to raise the credit and authority of the Other; which hath since proved as inconvenient, and troublesome to their own Coun∣try, as to their Neighbours.</P>
<P>HE was once more Embassadour extraordinary in <HI>Holland</HI> after the death of King <HI>James,</HI> and was the last who was admitted to be Present, and to Vote in the General Assembly of the States, under that Character; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of which great Priviledge the Crown had been possess'd from a great part of the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and through the time of King <HI>James,</HI> to that moment; which administred fresh matter of Murmur for the giving up the Towns of the <HI>Brill,</HI> and <HI>Flushing,</HI> which had been done some years before by King <HI>James;</HI> without which men thought those States would not have had the courage so soon to have degraded the Crown of <HI>England</HI> from a Place in their Councils, which had prosper'd so eminently under the Shadow of that Power, and Support. As soon as he return'd from <HI>Holland,</HI> he was call'd to the Privy-Council. The making him Secretary of State, and a Peer of the Realm, when his <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Estate was scarce visible, was the last piece of Workmanship the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> liv'd to finish, who seldom satisfied himself with conferring a single obligation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rise of Arch-Bisho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Laud</HI>'s Power in the Church.</NOTE> THE Duke had observ'd, and discover'd, that the channel, in which the Church Promotions had formerly run, had been liable to some cor∣ruptions, at least to many reproaches; and therefore had committed the sole representation of those affairs, and the recommending to the Va∣cancies which should happen, to D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Laud,</HI> then Bishop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> and sworn of the Privy-Council. And the King, after the Duke's death, continued that trust in the same Hands, infinitely to the Benefit <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and Honour of the Church, though, it may be, no less to the Prejudice of the poor Bishop; who, too secure in a good Conscience, and most sin∣cere worthy Intention (with which no man was ever more plentifully replenish'd) thought he could manage, and discharge the place and of∣fice of the Greatest Minister in the Court (for he was quickly made Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury)</HI> without the least condescension to the Arts and Stratagems of the Court, and without any other Friendship, or Support, than what the splendour of a Pious life, and his unpolish'd Integrity would reconcile to him: Which was an unskilful measure in a Licentious age, and may deceive a good man in the best times that shall succeed; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> which exposed him to such a torrent of Adversity and Misery, as we shall have too natural an occasion to Lament in the following Discourse, in which it will be more seasonable to enlarge upon his singular Abili∣ties, and immense Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="780"/>
THERE were more (too many more) Honourable Persons in that time of the Privy-Council, whose Faculties were not notorious enough to give them any great part in the Affairs, nor had their Advice much Influence upon them. Other very notable Men were shortly after added to the Council, who will hereafter be remember'd in their proper Places and Seasons. What hath been said before contains Information enough of the Persons in Employment, and the State of the Court and Kingdom, when the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was taken from it; by which, and the lively Reflexions upon the Qualities, and Qualifications of the several Persons in Authority in Court, and Council, no man could expect that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the vigorous designs and enterprizes, undertaken by the Duke, would be pursued with equal resolution, and courage: but that much the greater part of them would be wholely intent upon their own accommodations in their Fortunes (in which they abounded not) or in their Ease, and Pleasure, which they most passionately affected; having, as hath been said, no other consideration of the Publick, than that no disturbance therein might interrupt their quiet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n their own days: And that the rest, who had larger hearts, and more publick spirits, would extend their la∣bour, activity, and advice, only to Secure the empire at Home by all Peaceable arts, and advancement of Trade, which might gratify the Peo∣ple, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and fill the empty Coffers of the impoverish'd Crown. To which end the most proper expedients were best understood by them, not to enlarge it, by continuing and propagating the War; the ways, and means whereof they knew not how to comprehend; and had all the desperate imaginations, and jealousies of the end and necessary consequences of it. And so they All concur'd (though in nothing else) in their unanimous Advice to the King <Q>“”to put the quickest Period, he could possibly, to the expensive War against the two Crowns:</Q> and, his Majesty following<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> their Advice, a Peace was made with both, upon Better terms, and con∣ditions, and in Less time, than from the known Impatience of the War <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> could reasonably have been expected, or hoped for And after some un∣quietness of the People, and unhappy assaults upon the Prerogative by<NOTE PLACE="marg">The t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d Parliament Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>olv'd</NOTE> the Parliament, which produced its Dissolution, and thereupon some fro∣ward and obstinate disturbances in Trade; there quickly follow'd so ex∣cellent a Composure throughout the whole Kingdom, that the like Peace, and Plenty, and universal Tranquillity for ten years was never enjoy'd by any Nation; and was the more visible and manifest in <HI>England,</HI> by the sharp and bloody War suddainly entred into between the two neigh∣bour Crowns, and the universal Conflagration that, from the Invasion of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> cover'd the whole Empire of <HI>Germany.</HI> And so we shall <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> return to the Discourse, to which this very long Digression hath given a greater interruption than was intended.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> THAT Proclamation, mention'd before, at the breaking up of the last Parl ament, and which was commonly understood <Q>“”to inhibit all men to Speak of another Parliament,</Q> produced two very Ill Effects of dif∣ferent natures.

<PB N="53" REF="790"/>
of such an Inquisition did not only encourage Ill men to all boldness and licence, but wrought so far upon Men less inclined to ill (though not built for Examples) that they kept not those strict guards upon them∣selves, they used to do; especially if they found themselves above the reach of ordinary Justice, and fear'd not extraordinary, they by degrees<NOTE PLACE="marg">Projects of all kinds</NOTE> thought that no Fault, which was like to find no Punishment. Supple∣mental Acts of State were made to supply defect of Laws; and so Ton∣nage, and Poundage, and other duties upon Merchandizes, were collected by Order of the Board, which had been positively refused to be settled by <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Act of Parliament, and new, and greater Impositions laid upon Trade: Obsolete Laws were revived, and rigorously executed, wherein the Sub∣ject might be taught how unthrifty a thing it was, by too strict a detain∣ing of what was His, to put the King as strictly to enquire what was his Own.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That of Knight-hood.</NOTE> BY this Ill husbandry the King receiv'd a vast Sum of money from all Persons of Quality, or indeed of any reasonable condition through∣out the Kingdom, upon the Law of Knighthood; which, though it had a foundation in Right, yet, in the circumstances of Proceeding, was very grievous. And no less unjust Projects of all kinds, Many ridiculous, Many <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> scandalous, All very grievous, were set on foot; the Envy, and Reproach of which came to the King, the Profit to other men: insomuch that, of two hundred thousand pound drawn from the Subject, by these ways, in a year, scarce fifteen hundred came to the King's use, or account. To re∣compence<NOTE PLACE="marg">That of re∣viving For∣rest Law<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> the damage the Crown sustain'd by the Sale of the old Lands, and by the Grant of new Pensions, the old Laws of the Forrest were re∣vived, by which not only great Fines were imposed, but great annual Rents intended, and like to be settled by way of Contract; which Bur∣then lighted most upon Persons of Quality and Honour, who thought themselves above ordinary oppressions, and were therefore like to re∣member <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> it with more sharpness. Lastly, for a Spring and Magazine that<NOTE PLACE="marg">That of Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p∣money.</NOTE> should have no bottom, and for an everlasting Supply of all occasions, a Writ was framed in a Form of Law, and directed to the Sheriff of every County of <HI>England,</HI> <Q>“”to provide a Ship of War for the King's service, and to send it,</Q> amply provided and fitted, by such a day, to such a place; and with that Writ, were sent to each Sheriff, Instructions, that, <Q>“”in∣stead of a Ship, he should levy upon his County such a Sum of Mo∣ney, and return the same to the Treasurer of the Navy for his Maje∣sty's use,</Q> with direction, in what manner he should proceed against such as refused: and from hence that Tax had the denomination of <HI>Ship∣money;</HI> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> a word of a lasting sound in the memory of this Kingdom; by which for some years really accrew'd the yearly Sum of two hundred thousand pounds to the King's Coffers: and it was in truth the only Pro∣ject, that was accounted to his Own service. And, after the continued receipt of it for about four years together, it was at last (upon the refu∣sal of a Private Gentleman to pay twenty or thirty Shillings as his share) with great solemnity publickly Argued before all the Judges of <HI>England</HI> in the Exchequer Chamber, and by much the major part of them, the King's right to Impose asserted, and the Tax adjudged Lawful; which Judgement proved of more advantage, and credit to the Gentleman con∣demn'd <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> (M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden)</HI> than to the King's service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The powers of the Council-Table and Star-Chamber enlarged</NOTE> FOR the better Support of these extraordinary ways, and to Protect the agents, and instruments, who must be employ'd in them, and to Dis∣countenance, and Suppress all bold enquiries, and opposers, the Council-Table,

and Star-Chamber enlarge their Jurisdictions to a vast extent, <Q>“”holding (as <HI>Thucydides</HI> said of the <HI>Athenians)</HI> for Honourable, that which Pleased,</Q> and for Just, that which Profited; and being the Same persons in Several rooms, grew both Courts of Law to determine Right, and Courts of Revenue to bring Money into the Treasury; the Council-Table by Proclamations enjoyning to the People, what was not enjoyn'd by the Law, and prohibiting that which was not prohibited; and the Star-Chamber censuring the breach, and disobedience to those Proclama∣tions by very great Fines, and Imprisonment; so that any disrespect to any Acts of State, or to the Persons of States-men, was in no time more <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> penal, and those Foundations of Right, by which men valued their Secu∣rity, to the apprehension and understanding of Wise men, never more in danger to be destroy'd.</P>
<P>AND here I cannot but again take the liberty to say, that the Circum∣stances, and Proceedings in those new extraordinary cases, stratagems, and impositions, were very Unpolitick, and even Destructive to the Ser∣vices intended. And if the business of Ship-money, being an Imposition by the State, under the notion of necessity, upon a prospect of danger, which private persons could not modestly think themselves qualified to discern, had been managed in the same extraordinary way, as the Royal <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Loan (which was the imposing the Five Subsidies after the second Par∣liament spoken of before) was; men would much easier have submitted to it; as it is notoriously known, that Pressure was born with much more chearfulness before the Judgement for the King, than ever it was after; Men before pleasing themselves with doing somewhat for the King's service, as a testimony of their Affection, which they were not bound to do; many really believing the necessity, and therefore think∣ing the Burthen reasonable; others observing, that the advantage to the King was of importance, when the damage to them was not considerable; and all assuring themselves, that when they should be weary, or unwil∣ling <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to continue the Payment, they might resort to the Law for relief, and find it. But when they heard this demanded in a Court of Law, as a Right, and found it, by sworn Judges of the Law, adjudged so, upon such grounds and reasons as every Stander by was able to swear was not Law, and so had lost the pleasure and delight of being Kind, and Dutiful to the King; and, instead of Giving, were required to Pay, and by a Logick, that left no man any thing, which he might call his Own; they no more look'd upon it as the Case of One man, but the Case of the King∣dom, nor as an Imposition laid upon them by the King, but by the Judges; which they thought themselves bound in Conscience to the pub∣lick <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Justice not to Submit to. It was an observation long ago by <HI>Thucy∣dides,</HI> <Q>“”that men are much more passionate for Injustice, than for Vio∣lence; because, says he, the one coming as from an equal, seems Ra∣pine; when the other proceeding from one stronger, is but the effect of Necessity.</Q> So, when Ship-money was transacted at the Council-Board, they look'd upon it as a work of that Power, they were all obliged to trust, and an effect of that Foresight, they were naturall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to rely upon. Imminent Necessity, and publick Safety, were convincing perswasions; and it might not seem of apparent ill consequence to them, that upon an emergent occasion the Regal power should fill up an <HI>hiatus,</HI> or supply <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> an Impotency in the Law. But when they saw in a Court of Law (that Law, that gave them Title to, and Possession of all that they had) Reason of State urged as Elements of Law, Judges as Sharp-sighted as Secretaries
<PB N="55" REF="810"/>
of State, and in the mysteries of State; Judgement of Law grounded upon matter of Fact, of which there was neither enquiry, nor proof; and no Reason given for the payment of the thirty Shillings in question, but what included the Estates of all the Standers by, they had no reason to hope that Doctrine, or the Promoters of it, would be contain'd within any bounds; and it was no wonder that They, who had so little reason to be pleased with their own condition, were no less sollicitous for, or apprehensive of, the inconveniencies that might attend any alteration.</P>
<P>AND here the damage and mischief cannot be express'd, that the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Crown and State sustain'd by the deserv'd reproach and infamy, that attended the Judges, by being made use of in this, and like acts of power; there being no possibility to preserve the dignity, reverence, and estima∣tion of the Laws themselves, but by the integrity and innocency of the Judges. And no question, as the exorbitancy of the House of Commons, in the next Parliament, proceeded principally from their contempt of the Laws, and that contempt from the scandal of that Judgement: so the concurrence of the House of Peers in that fury, can be imputed to no one thing more, than to the irreverence and scorn the Judges were justly in; who had been allways before look'd upon There as the Oracles <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of the Law, and the best Guides to assist that House in their opinions, and actions: And the Lords now thought themselves excused for swerving from the rules and customs of their Predecessors (who in altering, and making of Laws, in judging of Things and Persons, had allways observ'd the advice and judgement of those Sages) in not asking questions of Those, whom they knew nobody would believe; thinking it a just re∣proach upon them (who out of their Courtship had submitted the diffi∣culties, and mysteries of the Law, to be measured by the standard of what they call<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d General Reason, and explain'd by the Wisdom of State) that They themselves should make use of the Licence, which the Others <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> had taught them, and determine that to be Law, which they thought to be reasonable, or found to be convenient. If These men had preserv'd the simplicity of their Ancestors, in severely and strictly defending the Laws, Other men had observ'd the modesty of Theirs, in humbly and dutifully Obeying them.</P>
<P>UPON this Consideration it is very observable, that in the wisdom of former times, when the Prerogative went highest (as very often it hath been swoln above any pitch we have seen it at in our times) never any Court of Law, very seldom any Judge, or Lawyer of reputation, was call'd upon to assist in an Act of Power; the Crown well knowing the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> moment of keeping Those the objects of reverence, and veneration with the People: and that though it might sometimes make sallies upon them by the Prerogative, yet the Law would keep the People from any inva∣sion of it, and that the King could never suffer, whilst the Law, and the Judges were look'd upon by the Subject, as the <HI>Asylum</HI> for their Li∣berties, and Security. And therefore yon shall find the Policy of many Princes hath endured as sharp animadversions, and reprehensions from the Judges of the Law, as their Piety hath from the Bishops of the Church; as having no less influence upon the People, under the reputa∣tion of Justice, by the one, than under the tyes of Conscience and Reli∣gion, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> by the other.</P>
<P>TO extend this Consideration of the form, and circumstance of pro∣ceeding in Cases of an unusual nature a little farther; As it may be most behoveful for Princes in matters of grace, and honour, and in conferring
<PB N="56" REF="820"/>
of favours upon their People, to transact the same as Publickly as may be, and by Themselves, or their Ministers to dilate upon it, and improve the lustre by any addition, or eloquence of Speech (where, it may be, every kind word, especially from the Prince himself, is look'd upon as a new bounty); So it is as requisite in matters of judgement, punish∣ment, and censure upon Things, or Persons (especially when the Case, in the nature of it, is unusual, and the rules in Judging as extraordinary) that the same be transacted as Privately, and with as little noise, and pomp of words, as may be. For (as Damage is much easier born, and submitted to by generous minds, than Disgrace) in the business of Ship∣money, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and many other Cases in the Star-chamber, and at Council-Board, there were many impertinencies, incongruities, and insolencies, in the Speeches, and Orations of the Judges, much mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offensive, and much more scandalous than the Judgements, and Sentences themselves. Besides that mens minds and understandings were more instructed to discern the consequence of things, which before they consider'd not. And undoubtedly my Lord <HI>Finch</HI>'s Speech in the Exchequer-Chamber made Ship-money much more abhor'd, and formidable, than all the Commitments by the Council-Table, and all the Distresses taken by the Sherifs in <HI>England:</HI> the major part of men (besides the common uncon∣cernedness <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in other mens sufferings) looking upon those Proceedings with a kind of applause to themselves, to see other men Punish'd, for not doing as they had done; which delight was quickly determin'd, when they found their own interest, by the unnecessary Logick of that Argu∣ment, no less concluded than M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambdens.</HI></P>
<P>HE hath been but an ill observer of the Passages of those times we speak of, who hath not seen many sober men, who have been clear∣ly satisfied with the conveniency, necessity, and justice of many Sen∣tences, depart notwithstanding extreamly offended, and scandalized with the grounds, reasons, and expressions of Those who inflicted those <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> censures; when they found Themselves, thinking to be only Spectators of other mens sufferings, by some unnecessary Inference or Declaration, in probable danger to become the next Delinquents.</P>
<P>THEY who look back upon the Council-Books of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the Acts of the Star-Chamber then, shall find as high instances of Power, and Soveraignty upon the Liberty, and Property of the Sub∣ject, as can be since given. But the art, order, and gravity of those Proceedings (where short, severe, constant rules were set, and smartly pursued, and the party felt only the weight of the Judgement, not the passion of his Judges) made them less taken notice of, and so less <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> grievous to the Publick, though as intolerable to the Person: whereas, since those excellent rules of the Council-Board were less observ'd, and debates (which ought to be in private, and in the absence of the par∣ty concern'd, and thereupon the Judgement of the Table to be pro∣nounced by one, without the interposition of others, or reply of the party) suffer'd to be publick, questions to be ask'd, passions discover'd, and opinions to be promiscuously deliver'd; all advice, directions, repre∣hensions, and censures of those Places grew to be in less reverence, and esteem: so that, besides the delay, and interruption in dispatch, the ju∣stice, and prudence of the Counsels did not many times weigh down the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> infirmity, and passion of the Counsellors; and both Suitors, and Offen∣ders return'd into their Country, with such exceptions, and arguments against Persons, as brought, and prepared much prejudice to whatsoever
<PB N="57" REF="830"/>
should proceed from thence; and whatever Excuses shall be made, or Arguments given, that upon such extraordinary occasions there was a ne∣cessity of some pains, and care to convince men's understandings of the reasons and grounds of their Proceeding (which, if what was done had been only <HI>ad informandam Conscientiam</HI> without reproach, or penalty, might have been reasonable) it is certain the inconvenience and preju∣dice, that grew thereby, was greater than the benefit: and the reasons of the Judges being many times not the reasons of the Judgement, those might more satisfactorily, and more shortly have been put in the Sen∣tence <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> it self, than spread in the Discourses of the Censurers.</P>
<P>THESE Errors (for Errors they were in View, and Errors they are proved by the Success) are not to be imputed to the Court, but to the Spirit, and Over-activity of the Lawyers themselves; who should more carefully have preserv'd their Profession, and its Professors, from being profaned by those Services, which have rendred both so obnoxious to reproach. There were two Persons of that Profession, and of that time, by whose several, and distinct constitutions (the one knowing no∣thing of, nor caring for the Court; the other knowing, or caring for nothing else) those Mischiefs were introduced, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Noy,</HI> the Atturney <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> General, and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Finch,</HI> first, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and then Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Atturney General <HI>Noy.</HI></NOTE> THE First upon the great fame of his Ability, and Learning (and he was very Able and Learned) was, by great industry and importunity from Court, perswaded to accept that Place, for which all other men la∣bour'd (being the best, for Profit, that Profession is capable of) and so he suffer'd himself to be made the King's Atturney General. The Court made no impression upon his Manners; upon his Mind it did: and though he wore about him an affected morosity, which made him unapt to flat∣ter other men, yet even that morosity and pride rendred him the most <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> liable to be grosly flatter'd himself, that can be imagin'd. And by this means the great Persons, who steer'd the Publick affairs, by admiring his Parts, and extolling his Judgement as well to his face, as behind his back, wrought upon him by degrees, for the eminency of the Service, to be an Instrument in all their Designs; thinking that he could not give a clearer testimony, that his knowledge in the Law was greater than all other mens, than by making that Law, which all other men believ'd Not to be so. So he moulded, framed, and pursued the odious and cry∣ing Project of Soap; and with his own hand drew, and prepared the Writ for Ship-money; both which will be the lasting monuments of his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Fame. In a word, he was an unanswerable instance, how necessary a good Education and knowledge of Men is to make a wise man, at least a man fit for business.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of S<SUP>•</SUP></HI> John Finch.</NOTE> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Finch</HI> had Much that the other wanted, but Nothing that the other had. Having led a free life in a restrain'd fortune, and having set up upon the stock of a good Wit, and natural Parts, without the super∣structure of much knowledge in the Profession by which he was to grow; he was willing to use those Weapons in which he had most Skill, and so (being not unseen in the affections of the Court, but not having repu∣tation enough to guide, or reform them) he took up Ship-money where <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Noy</HI> left it; and, being a Judge, carried it up to that pinacle, from whence he allmost broke his own neck; having, in his journey thither, had too much influence on his Brethren to induce them to concur in a Judgement, they had all cause to repent. To which, his Declaration,
<PB N="58" REF="840"/>
after he was Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> must be added, upon a Demurrer put in to a Bill before him, which had no other Equity in it, than an Order of the Lords of the Council; <Q>“”that whilst He was Keeper, no man should be so sawcy as to dispute those Orders, but that the Wisdom of that Board should be allways ground enough for Him to make a Decree in Chancery;</Q> which was so great an aggravation of the Excess of that Table, that it receiv'd more prejudice from that act of un∣reasonable Countenance and Respect, than from all the Contempt could possibly have been offer'd to it. But of this no more.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> NOW after all this (and I hope I cannot be accused of much Flattery <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> in this Inquisition) I must be so Just as to say, that, during the whole time that these Pressures were exercised, and those new and extraordi∣nary Ways were run, that is, from the dissolution of the Parliament in the Fourth year, to the beginning of this Parliament, which was above twelve years, this Kingdom, and all his Majesty's Dominions (of the Interruption in <HI>Scotland</HI> somewhat shall be said in its due time and place) enjoy'd the greatest Calm, and the fullest measure of Felicity, that any People in any Age, for so long time together, have been bless'd with; to the wonder, and envy of all the other parts of <HI>Christendom.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> IN this Comparison I am neither unmindful of, nor ungrateful for <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the Happy times of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and King <HI>James.</HI> But for the for∣mer, the doubts, hazards, and perplexities, upon a total change and al∣teration of Religion, and some confident Attempts upon a farther altera∣tion by Those, who thought the Reformation not carry'd far enough; the charge, trouble, and anxiety of a long continued War (how pro∣sperous and successful soever) even during that Queens whole Reign; and (besides some domestick ruptures into Rebellion, frequently into Treason; and besides the blemish of an unparallel'd Act of Blood upon the Life of a Crown'd neighbour Queen and Ally) the fear, and appre∣hension of what was to come (which is one of the most unpleasant kinds <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of Melancholy) from an unknown, at least an unacknowledg'd Successor to the Crown, clouded much of that Prosperity then, which now shines with so much splendour before our eyes in Chronicle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> AND for the other under King <HI>James</HI> (which indeed were excellent times, <HI>bona si sua norint)</HI> the mingling with a Stranger Nation, for∣merly not very gracious with This; which was like to have more interest of Favour: the subjection to a Stranger Prince, whose nature and dispo∣sition they knew not: the discovery of a Treason, the most prodigious that had ever been attempted, upon his first entrance into the Kingdom: the Wants of the Crown not inferior to what it hath since felt (I mean <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> whilst it sate right on the head of the King) and the Pressures upon the Subject of the same nature, and no less complain'd of: the Absence of the Prince in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the sollicitude that his Highness should not be disposed in marriage to the Daughter of that Kingdom, rendred the Calm and Tranquillity of that time less equal, and pleasant. To which may be added the Prosperity and Happiness of the Neighbour Kingdoms not much inferior to that of this, which, according to the pulse of States, is a great diminution of their health; at least their Prosperity is much im∣proved, and more visible, by the Misery, and Misfortunes of their Neighbours. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THE Happiness of the times, I now mention, was invidiously set off by this distinction, that every other Kingdom, every other State were entangled, and some allmost destroy'd by the rage, and fury of Arms;
<PB N="59" REF="850"/>
those who were engaged in an ambitious Contention with their Neigh∣bours, having the view and apprehensions of the Miseries, and Desola∣tion, which they saw other States suffer by a Civil War; whilst the Kingdoms, we now lament, were alone look'd upon as the Garden of the world; <HI>Scotland</HI> (which was but the Wilderness of that Garden) in a full, entire, and undisturb'd Peace, which they had never seen; the rage and barbarism of their private Feuds being composed to the reverence, or to the awe of publick Justice; in a competency, if not in an excess of Plenty, which they had never hopes to see, and in a temper (which was <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the utmost that in those days was desired or hoped for) free from Rebel∣lion. <HI>Ireland,</HI> which had been a Spunge to draw, and a Gulph to swal∣low all that could be spared, and all that could be got from <HI>England,</HI> meerly to keep the reputation of a Kingdom, reduced to that good de∣gree of Husbandry, and Government, that it not only Subsisted of it¦self, and gave this Kingdom all that it might have expected from it; but really increased the Revenue of the Crown forty or fifty thousand pounds a year, besides a considerable advantage to the People by the Traffick, and Trade from thence; Arts, and Sciences fruitfully planted there; and the whole Nation beginning to be so Civilized, that it was a Jewel of great <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Lustre in the Royal Diadem.</P>
<P>WHEN these Outworks were thus fortified, and adorn'd, it was no wonder if <HI>England</HI> was generally thought secure, with the advantages of its own Climate; the Court in great plenty, or rather (which is the discredit of plenty) excess, and luxury; the Country rich, and which is more, fully enjoying the pleasure of its own wealth, and so the easier corrupted with the pride, and wantonness of it; the Church flourishing with learned, and extraordinary Men, and (which other good times had in some degree wanted) supplied with Oyl to feed those Lamps; and the Protestant Religion more advanced against the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> by <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Writing (without prejudice to other Useful, and Godly labours) especial∣ly by those two Books of the late Lord Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> his Grace, and of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> than it had been from the Reformation; Trade increased to that degree, that we were the Exchange of <HI>Christen∣dom</HI> (the Revenue from thence to the Crown being allmost double to what it had been in the best times) and the Bullion of neighbour King∣doms brought to receive a Stamp from the Mint of <HI>England;</HI> Forreign Merchants looking upon nothing so much their own, as what they had laid up in the Warchouses of this Kingdom; the Royal Navy, in num∣ber and equipage much above former times, very formidable at Sea; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and the reputation of the Greatness, and Power of the King, much more with Forreign Princes than any of his Progenitors: for those rough Courses, which made him perhaps less Lov'd at home, made him more Fear'd abroad; by how much the Power of Kingdoms is more reverenced than their Justice by their Neighbours: and it may be this Consideration might not be the least Motive, and may not be the worst Excuse for those Councils. Lastly for a complement of all these Blessings, they were enjoy'd by, and under the Protection of a King, of the most Harmless disposition, the most exemplary Piety, the greatest Sobriety, Chastity, and Mercy, that any Prince hath been endow'd with (God forgive those, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that have not been Sensible of, and Thankful for those endowments) and who might have said, that which <HI>Pericles</HI> was proud of, upon his death∣bed, concerning his Citizens, <Q>“”that no <HI>English</HI>-man had ever worn a Mourning Gown through His occasion.</Q> In a word, many Wise men
<PB N="60" REF="860"/>

<P>BUT all these Blessings could but enable, not compel us to be Hap∣py: we wanted That sense, acknowledgment, and value of our own Happiness, which All but We had: and took pains to make, when we could not find, our selves Miserable. There was in truth a strange ab∣sence of understanding in most, and a strange perverseness of under∣standing in the rest: the Court full of excess, idleness, and luxury; the Country full of pride, mutiny, and discontent; every man more troubled <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and perplex'd at that they call'd the Violation of one Law, than de∣lighted or pleased with the Observation of all the rest of the Charter; never imputing the Increase of their receipts, revenue, and plenty, to the wisdom, virtue, and merit of the Crown, but objecting every small Imposition to the exorbitancy, and tyranny of the Government; the growth of Knowledge and Learning being disrelish'd, for the Infirmi∣ties of some Learned Men, and the increase of Grace and Favour upon the Church more repined and murmur'd at, than the increase of Piety and Devotion in it, which was as visible, acknowledg'd, or taken notice of; whilst the Indiscretion and Folly of one Sermon at <HI>White-Hall</HI> was <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> more bruited abroad, and commented upon, than the Wisdom, Sobrie∣ty, and Devotion of a hundred.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied but there was sometimes Preach'd there Matter very unfit for the Place, and very scandalous for the Persons, who pre∣sumed often to determine things out of the verge of their own Profes∣sion, and, <HI>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</HI> gave unto Caesar, what Caesar re∣fused to receive, as not belonging to him. But it is as true (as was once said by a Man fitter to be believ'd in that point than I, and one not suspected for flattering of the Clergy) <Q>“”that if the Sermons of those times Preach'd in Court, were collected together, and publish'd, the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> world would receive the best bulk of Orthodox Divinity, profound Learning, convincing Reason, natural powerful Eloquence, and ad∣mirable Devotion, that hath been communicated in any Age since the Apostles time.</Q> And I cannot but say, for the honour of the King, and of Those, who were trusted by him in his Ecclesiastical collations (who have receiv'd but sad rewards for their uprightness) in those reproach'd, condemn'd times, there was not one Church-man, in any degree of fa∣vour, or acceptance (and this the Inquisition, that hath been since made upon them, a stricter never was in any Age, must confess) of a scanda∣lous insufficiency in Learning, or of a more scandalous condition of Life; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> but on the contrary, most of them of confess'd eminent parts in Know∣ledge, and of virtuous and unblemish'd Lives. And therefore Wise men knew, that That, which look'd like Pride in some, and like Petulance in others, would, by Experience in affairs, and Conversation amongst men, both of which most of them wanted, be in time wrought off, or, in a new Succession, reform'd, and so thought the vast advantage from their Learning, and Integrity, an ample recompence for any inconvenience from their Passion; and yet by the prodigious Impiety of those times, the latter was only look'd on with malice and revenge, without any re∣verence, or gratitude for the former. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's first Journey into <HI>Scotland</HI> to be Crown'd there.</NOTE> WHEN the King found himself possess'd of all that Tranquillity men∣tion'd before, that he had no reason to apprehend any Enemies from abroad, and less any Insurrections at home, against which no Kingdom
<PB N="61" REF="870"/>
in <HI>Christendom,</HI> in the constitution of its Government, in the solidity of the Laws, and in the nature and disposition of the People, was more Secure than <HI>England;</HI> that He might take a nearer view of those great Blessings which God had poured upon him, he resolv'd to make a Pro∣gress into the Northern parts of his Kingdom, and to be solemnly Crown'd in his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which he had never seen from the time he had first left it, when he was about two years old. In order to this Journey, which was made with great Splendour, and proportionable Expence, he added to the Train of his Court many of the greatest Nobi∣lity, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> who increased the Pomp of the Court at their own charge (for so they were required to do) and seem'd with alacrity to submit to the King's pleasure, as soon as they knew his desire; and so his Attendance in all respects was proportionable to the Glory of the greatest King.</P>
<P>THIS whole Progress was made from the first setting out, to the end of it, with the greatest Magnificence imaginable; and the highest excess of Feasting was then introduced, or, at least, Feasting was then carried to a height, it never had attain'd before, from whence it hardly declined afterwards, to the great damage and mischief of the Nation in their Estates, and Manners. All Persons of Quality and Condition, who liv'd <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> within distance of the Northern Road, receiv'd the great persons of the Nobility with that Hospitality, which became them; in which all cost was employ'd to make their Entertainments splendid, and their Houses capable of those entertainments. The King himself met with many en∣tertainments of that nature, at the charge of particular Men, who de∣sired the honour of his Presence, which had been rarely practised till then by the Persons of the best Condition, though it hath since grown in∣to a very inconvenient custom. But when he pass'd through <HI>Nottingham∣shire,</HI> both King and Court were receiv'd, and entertain'd by the Earl of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and at his own proper expence, in such a wonderful manner, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and in such an excess of Feasting, as had scarce ever before been known in <HI>England;</HI> and would be still thought very prodigious, if the same noble Person had not, within a year or two afterwards, made the King and Queen a more stupendious Entertainment; which (God be thanked) though possibly it might too much whet the appetite of others to Excess, no man ever after in those days Imitated.</P>
<P>THE great Offices of the Court, and principal places of Attendance upon the King's person, were then upon the matter equally divided be∣tween the <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>Scots;</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton</HI> Master of the Horse, and the Earl of <HI>Carlisle</HI> first Gentleman of the Bedchamber, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and allmost all the second rank of Servants in that place, being of that Kingdom; so that there was as it were an Emulation between the two Nations, which should appear in the greatest Lustre, in Cloaths, Horses, and Attendance: and as there were (as is said before) many of the prin∣cipal Nobility, of <HI>England,</HI> who attended upon the King, and who were not of the Court; so the Court was never without many <HI>Scotish</HI> Volun∣tiers, and their number was well increased upon this occasion in Nobi∣lity and Gentry, who were resolv'd to confute all those, who had be∣liev'd their Country to be very poor.</P>

<PB N="62" REF="880"/>
<HI>Lenox</HI> was then high Steward, and high Admiral of <HI>Scotland</HI> by Descent, as Others had the like possession of other Places; so that all the Tables of the House, which had been kept by the <HI>English</HI> Officers, were laid down, and taken up again by the <HI>Scots,</HI> who kept them up with the same order, and equal splendour, and treated the <HI>English</HI> with all the freedom and courtesy imaginable; as all the Nobility of that Nation did, at their own expence, where their Offices did not entitle them to Tables at the charge of the Crown, keep very noble Houses to entertain their new Guests; who had so often, and so well entertain'd them: and it cannot be denied, the whole behaviour of that Nation towards the <HI>English</HI> was <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> as generous, and obliging as could be expected; and the King appear'd with no less Lustre at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> than at <HI>White-Hall;</HI> and in this Pomp his Coronation pass'd with all the Solemnity, and evidence of publick Joy that could be expected, or that can be imagin'd; and the Par∣liament, then held, with no less demonstration of Duty, pass'd and pre∣sented those Acts which were prepared for them to the Royal Scepter; in which were some Laws restraining the extravagant power of the No∣bility, which, in many cases, they had long exercised, and the diminu∣tion whereof they took very heavily, though at that time they took little notice of it; the King being absolutely advised in all the Affairs of that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Kingdom then, and long before, and after, by the sole counsel of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who was, or at least, was then believ'd to be of the greatest Interest of any Subject in that Kingdom, of whom more will be said hereafter.</P>
<P>THE King was very well pleased with his Reception, and with all the Transactions there; nor indeed was there any thing to be blamed, but the luxury, and vast expence, which abounded in all respects of Feasting, and Cloaths with too much licence: which being imputed to the commendable zeal of the People, of all conditions, to see their King amongst them, whom they were not like to see there again, and so their <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> expence was to be but once made, no man had cause to suspect any mis∣chief from it: and yet the Debts contracted at that time by the Nobility, and Gentry, and the Wants and Temptations they found themselves ex∣posed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Commo∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s then s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n.</NOTE> to, from that unlimited Expence, did very much contribute to the kindling that Fire, which shortly after broke out in so terrible a combu∣stion: nor were the sparks of Murmur and Sedition then so well co∣ver'd, but that many discerning men discover'd very pernicious Designs to lurk in Their breasts, who seem'd to have the most chearful Counte∣nances, and who acted great parts in the Pomp, and Triumph. And it evidently appear'd, that They of that Nation, who Shined most in the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Court of <HI>England,</HI> had the least Influence in their own Country, except only the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> whose affection to his Master was even then suspected by the wisest Men in both Kingdoms; and that the im∣mense Bounties the King, and his Father had scatter'd amongst Those of that Nation, out of the Wealth of <HI>England,</HI> besides that he had sacrificed the whole Revenue of that Kingdom to Themselves, were not look'd upon as any benefit to that Nation, but as obligations cast away upon particular Men; many of whom had with it wasted their own Patri∣mony in their Country.</P>
<P>THE King himself observ'd many of the Nobility to endeavour to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> make themselves popular by speaking in Parliament against those things which were most grateful to his Majesty, and which still Pass'd notwith∣standing their contradiction; and he thought a little Discountenance
<PB N="63" REF="890"/>
upon those Persons would either suppress that Spirit within themselves, or make the Poyson of it less operative upon others. But as those acts of Discountenance were too often believ'd to proceed from the displeasure of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and by that means rather advanced, thau depress'd them, so they had an admirable dexterity in sheltering them∣selves from any of those Acts of discountenance, which they had no mind to own; when it hath been visible, and was then notorious, that many of the persons then, as the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and others, of whom the King had the worst opinion, and from whom he purposely with-held <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> any grace by never speaking to them, or taking notice of them in the Court, yet when the King was abroad in the Fields, or passing through Villages, when the greatest crouds of People flock'd to see him, those men would still be next him, and entertain him with some discourse, and pleasant relations, which the King's gentle disposition could not avoid, and which made those Persons to be generally believ'd to be most ac∣ceptable to his Majesty; upon which the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> was wont to say, <Q>“”that keeping of State was like committing Adultery, there must go Two to it:</Q> for let the proudest or most formal man resolve to keep what distance he will towards others, a bold and confident man instant∣ly <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> demolishes that whole Machine, and gets within him, and even obliges him to his own Laws of conversation.</P>
<P>THE King was allways the most punctual observer of all Decency in his Devotion, and the strictest promoter of the Ceremonies of the Church, as believing in his Soul the Church of <HI>England</HI> to be instituted the nearest to the Practice of the Apostles, and the best for the propagation and ad∣vancement of Christian Religion, of any Church in the world: and on the other side, though no man was more averse from the <HI>Romish</HI> Church than He was, nor better understood the motives of their Separation from us, and Animosity against us, he had the highest dislike, and prejudice to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that part of his own Subjects, who were against the Government esta∣lish'd, and did allways look upon them as a very dangerous, and sedi∣tious People; who would under pretence of Conscience, which kept them from submitting to the Spiritual Jurisdiction, take the first opportunity, they could find, or make, to withdraw themselves from their Temporal Subjection; and therefore he had, with the utmost vigilance, caused that Temper and Disposition to be watch'd and provided against in <HI>England;</HI> and if it were then in truth there, it lurk'd with wonderful secrecy. In <HI>Scotland</HI> indeed it cover'd the whole Nation, so that, though there were Bishops in Name, the whole Jurisdiction, and they Themselves were, upon <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the matter, subject to an Assembly, which was purely Presbyterian; no Form of Religion in practice, no Liturgy, nor the least appearance of any Beauty of Holiness: The Clergy, for the most part, corrupted in their Principles, at least, none countenanced by the great Men, or fa∣vour'd by the People, but Such; though it must be own'd their Univer∣sities, especially <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> flourish'd under many excellent Scholars, and very Learned men. Yet, though all the Cathedral Churches were total∣ly neglected with reference to those Administrations, over the whole Kingdom, the King's own Chappel at <HI>Holy-rood-house</HI> had still been maintain'd with the comeliness of the Cathedral Service, and all other <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Decencies used in the Royal Chappel; and the whole Nation seem'd, in the time of King <HI>James,</HI> well inclined to receive the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which that King exceedingly desired, and was so confident of, that they who were Privy to his Counsels, in that time, did
<PB N="64" REF="900"/>
believe, the bringing that Work to pass was the principal end of his Pro∣gress thither some years before his death; though he was not so well sa∣tisfied at his being there, two or three of the principal Persons trusted by him in the Government of that Kingdom, dying in, or about that very time; but though he return'd without making any visible attempt in that Affair, yet he retain'd still the purpose and resolution to his death to bring it to pass. However his two or three last years having been less pleasant to him, by the Prince's voyage into <HI>Spain,</HI> the Jealousies which, about that time, begun in <HI>England,</HI> and the high Proceedings in Par∣liament there, he thought it necessary to suspend any prosecution of that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Design, untill a more favourable conjuncture, which he liv'd not to see.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transactions about intro∣ducing a Li∣turgy into <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> THE King his Son, who with his Father's other Virtues, inherited that Zeal for Religion, proposed nothing more to himself, than to Unite his three Kingdoms in one Form of God's Worship, and publick Devo∣tions; and there being now so great a Serenity in all his Dominions as is mention'd before, there is great reason to believe, that in this journey into <HI>Scotland</HI> to be Crown'd, he carried with him the resolution to Finish that important business in the Church at the same time. To that end, the then Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Laud,</HI> attended on his Majesty throughout that whole Journey, which, as he was Dean of the Chappel, he was not <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> obliged to do, and no doubt would have been excused from, if that De∣sign had not been in view; to accomplish which he was no less sollicitous than the King himself, nor the King the less sollicitous for his advice. He Preach'd in the Royal Chappel at <HI>Edenborough</HI> (which scarce any <HI>English</HI>-man had ever done before in the King's presence) and principally upon the benefit of Conformity, and the reverend Ceremonies of the Church, with all the marks of approbation and applause imaginable; the great civility of that People being so notorious, and universal, that they would not appear unconformable to his Majesty's wish in any par∣ticular. And many Wise men were then, and still are of opinion, that, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> if the King had Then proposed the Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> to have been receiv'd and practised by that Nation, it would have been sub∣mitted to without opposition: but, upon mature consideration, the King concluded that it was not a good Season to promote that Business.</P>
<P>HE had Pass'd two or three Acts of Parliament, which had much lessen'd the Authority and Dependence of the Nobility, and great Men, and incensed, and disposed them proportionably to cross, and oppose any Proposition, which would be most grateful; and that overthwart hu∣mour was enough discover'd to rule in the breasts of many, who made the greatest professions. Yet this was not the Obstruction, which diverted <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the King: the Party that was averse from the thing, and abhor'd any thought of Conformity, could not have been powerful enough to have stop'd the progress of it; the mischief was, that They, who most desired it, and were most concern'd to promote it, were the men, who used all their credit to divert the Present attempting it; and the Bishops them∣selves, whose Interest was to be most advanced thereby, applied all their counsels secretly to have the matter more Maturely consider'd; and the whole Design was never consulted but Privately, and only some few of the great Men of that Nation, and some of the Bishops advised with by the King, and the Bishop of <HI>London;</HI> it being manifest enough, that <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> as the Finishing that great Affair must be very grateful to <HI>England,</HI> so the <HI>English</HI> must not appear to have a hand in the Contriving, and Pro∣moting it.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="910"/>
THE same Men, who did not only pretend, but really and heartily wish, that they might have a Liturgy to order, and regulate the Worship of God in their Churches, and did very well approve the Ceremonies esta∣blish'd in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and desired to submit to, and practice the same there, had no mind that the Very Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> should be proposed to, or accepted by them; for which they of∣fer'd two prudential Reasons, as their Observations upon the nature, and humour of the Nation, and upon the Conferences, they had often had with the Best men upon that Subject, which was often agitated in <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> discourse, upon what had been formerly projected by King <HI>James,</HI> and upon what frequently occur'd to Wise men in Discourses upon the thing it self, and the desirableness of it.</P>
<P>THE First was, that the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy, how piously and wisely so∣ever framed, and instituted, had found great Opposition: and though the matter of the Ceremonies had wrought for the most part only upon Light-headed, Weak men, whose satisfaction was not to be labour'd for; yet there were many Grave, and Learned men, who excepted against some Particulars, which would not be so easily answer'd; <Q>“”That the reading Psalms being of the old Translation were in many particulars <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> so different from the new, and better Translation, that many instances might be given of importance to the Sense,</Q> and Truth of Scripture. They said somewhat of the same nature concerning the Translation of the Epistles, and Gospels, and some other Exceptions against reading the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> and some other Particulars of less moment; <Q>and desired “”that in forming a Liturgy for Their Church, they might, by reforming those several Instances, give satisfaction to Good men, who would thereupon be easily induced to submit to it.</Q></P>
<P>THE other Reason, which no doubt was the principal, and took this in the way to give it the better introduction, was, <Q>“”that the Kingdom <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of <HI>Scotland</HI> generally had been long Jealous, that by the King's con∣tinued absence from them, they should by degrees be reduced to be but as a Province to <HI>England,</HI> and subject to their Laws, and Government, which they would never submit to; nor would any man of Honour, who lov'd the King best, and respected <HI>England</HI> most, ever consent to bring that Dishonour upon his Country. If the very Liturgy, in the terms it is constituted, and practised in <HI>England,</HI> should be offer'd to them, it would kindle, and inflame that Jealousy, as the Prologue, and Introduction to that Design, and as the first Range of that Ladder, which should serve to mount over all their Customs, and Priviledges, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and be opposed, and detested accordingly: whereas if his Majesty would give order for the preparing a Liturgy, with those few desirable Al∣terations, it would easily be done; and in the mean time They would so dispose the minds of the People for the reception of it, that they should even desire it.</Q> This Expedient was so passionately, and vehe∣mently urged even by the Bishops, that however they defer'd to the minds, and humours of other men, it was manifest enough, that the Ex∣ception, and Advice proceeded from the pride of their own hearts.</P>
<P>THE Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who was allways present with the King at these Debates, was exceedingly troubled at this Delay, and to find those <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> men the Instruments in it, who seem'd to him as Sollicitous for the ex∣pedition, as Zealous for the thing it self, and who could not but Suffer by the deferring it. He knew well how far any Enemies to Conformity would be from being satisfied with those small Alterations, which being
<PB N="66" REF="920"/>
consented to, they would with more confidence, though less reason, frame other Exceptions, and insist upon them with more obstinacy. He foresaw the Difficulties which would arise in rejecting, or altering, or adding to the Liturgy, which had so great Authority, and had, by the practice of near fourscore years, obtain'd great Veneration from all sober Protestants; and how much easier it would be to make Objections against any thing that should be New, than against the Old; and would there∣fore have been very glad that the former Resolution might be pursued; there having never been any thoughts in the time of King <HI>James,</HI> or the present King, but of the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy; besides that any Variation <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> from it, in how small matters soever, would make the Uniformity the less, the Manifestation whereof was that, which was most aim'd at, and desired.</P>
<P>THE King had exceedingly set his heart upon the matter, and was as much scandalized as any man at the Disorder, and Indecency in the exercise of Religion in that Church: yet he was affected with what was offer'd for a little Delay in the execution, and knew more of the ill hu∣mour, and practices amongst the Greatest Men of the Kingdom at that season, than the Bishop did, and believ'd he could better compose, and reduce them in a little time, and at a distance, than at the present, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> whilst he was amongst them. Besides he was in his nature much inclined to the <HI>Scotish</HI> Nation, having been born amongst them, and as Jealous, as any one of Them could be, of their Liberties and Priviledges, and as Careful they might not be Invaded by the <HI>English,</HI> who, he knew, had no great reverence for them: and therefore the Objection, <Q>“”that it would look like an Imposition from <HI>England,</HI> if a Form, settled in Parliament at <HI>Westminster,</HI> should without any Alteration be tender'd (though by Himself) to be submitted to,</Q> and observ'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> made a deep Impression in his Majesty.</P>
<P>IN a word, he committed the Framing, and Composing such a Li∣turgy, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> as would most probably be Acceptable to that People, to a select number of the Bishops there, who were very able and willing to under∣take it: and so his Majesty return'd into <HI>England,</HI> at the time he had de∣sign'd, without having ever proposed, or made the least approach in Publick, towards any Alteration in the Church.</P>
<P>IT had been very happy, if there had been then nothing done indeed, that had any reference to that Affair, and that, since it was not ready, nothing had been transacted to promote it, which accidentally alienated the affections of the People from it; and what was done, was imputed to the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who was like enough to be guilty of it; since <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> he did really believe, that nothing more contributed to the benefit, and advancement of the Church, than the promotion of Church-men to places of the greatest Honour, and offices of the highest Trust: This Opi∣nion, and the Prosecution of it (though his Integrity was unquestion∣able, and his Zeal as great for the good and honour of the State, as for the advancement and security of the Church) was the unhappy Foun∣dation of his own Ruin, and of the Prejudice towards the Church, the Malice against it, and allmost the Destruction of it.</P>

<PB N="67" REF="930"/>
where the Council of State and the Courts of Justice still remain'd, was but a Burrough Town within the Diocess of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Saint Andrews,</HI> and govern'd in all Church affairs by the Preachers of the Town; who, being chosen by the Citizens from the time of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Knox</HI> (who had a principal hand in the Suppression of Popery, with circum∣stances not very commendable to this day) had been the most turbulent, and seditious Ministers of Confusion, that could be found in the King∣dom; of which King <HI>James</HI> had so sad experience, after he came to age, as well as in his minority, that he would often say, <Q>“”that his access to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Crown of <HI>England</HI> was the more valuable to him, as it redeem'd him from the subjection to the ill manners, and insolent practices of those Preachers,</Q> which he could never shake off before. The King before his return from thence, with the full consent and approbation of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Saint Andrews,</HI> erected <HI>Edenborough</HI> into a Bishoprick; assign'd it a good and convenient Jurisdiction out of the nearest limits of the Diocess of <HI>Saint Andrews,</HI> appointed the fairest Church in the Town to be the Cathedral, settled a competent Revenue upon the Bishop out of Lands purchased by his Majesty himself from the Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> who sold it much the cheaper, that it might be con∣secrated <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to so Pious an end; and placed a very eminent Scholar of a good Family in the Kingdom, who had been educated in the University of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to be the first Bishop in that his new City; and made an∣other Person, of good Fame, and Learning, the first Dean of his new Cathedral, upon whom likewise he settled a proper Maintenance; hoping by this means the better to prepare the People of the Place, who were the most numerous and richest of the Kingdom, to have a due reverence to Order and Government, and, at least, to discountenance, if not sup∣press the Factious Spirit of Presbytery, which had so long ruled there. But this Application little contributed thereunto: the People generally <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> thought, that they had too many Bishops before, and so the increasing the number was not like to be very grateful to them.</P>
<P>THE Bishops had indeed very little Interest in the affections of that Nation, and less Authority over it; they had not power to Reform, or Regulate their own Cathedrals, and very rarely shew'd themselves in the Habit and Robes of Bishops; and durst not contest with the General Assembly in matters of Jurisdiction: so that there was little more than<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty prefers some Bishops in <HI>Scotland</HI> to Secular offices unseasonably.</NOTE> the Name of Episcopacy preserv'd in that Church. To redeem them from that Contempt, and to shew that they should be Considerable in the State, how little Authority soever they were permitted to have in the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Church, the King made the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Saint Andrews,</HI> a Learned, Wise, and Pious man, and of long Experience, Chancellor of the King∣dom (the greatest Office, and which had never been in the hands of a Church-man since the Reformation of Religion, and Suppressing the Pope's Authority) and four or five other Bishops of the Privy-Council, or Lords of the Session; which his Majesty presumed, by their Power in the Civil Government, and in the Judicatories of the Kingdom, would render them so much the more Reverenced, and the better enable them to Settle the affairs of the Church: which fell out otherwise too; and it had been better that invidious Promotion had been suspended, till by their <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> grave and pious deportment they had wrought upon their Clergy to be better disposed to obey them, and upon the People to like order and discipline; and till by these means the Liturgy had been settled, and re∣ceiv'd amongst them; and then the advancing some of them to greater Honour, might have done well.</P>

BUT this unseasonable accumulation of so many Honours upon them, to which their Functions did not entitle them (no Bishop having been so much as a Privy-Counsellor in very many years) exposed them to the universal Envy of the whole Nobility, many whereof wish'd them well, as to their Ecclesiastical qualifications, but could not endure to see them possess'd of those Offices and Employments, which they look'd upon as naturally belonging to Themselves; and then the number of them was thought too great, so that they Over-ballanced many Debates; and some of them by want of temper, or want of breeding, did not behave them∣selves with that Decency in their Debates, towards the greatest Men of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Kingdom, as in discretion they ought to have done, and as the others reasonably expected from them: so that instead of bringing any Advan∣tage to the Church, or facilitating the good Intentions of the King in settling Order and Government, it produced a more general Prejudice to it; though for the present there appear'd no sign of Discontent, or ill Will to them: and the King left <HI>Scotland,</HI> as he believ'd, full of Affection and Duty to him, and well inclined to receive a Liturgy, when he should think it seasonable to commend it to them.</P>

He had been Head, or Master of one of the poorest Colleges in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and had Learning sufficient for that Province He was a man of very morose manners, and a very sowr aspect, which, in that time, was call'd Gravity; and under the opinion of that Virtue, and by the recommendation of the Earl of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> the King's first <HI>Scotish</HI> Favourite, he was prefer'd by King <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> <HI>James</HI> to the Bishoprick of <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Litchfield,</HI> and presently after to <HI>London,</HI> before he had been Parson, Vicar, or Curate of any Parish-Church in <HI>England,</HI> or Dean, or Prebend of any Cathedral-Church; and was in truth totally ignorant of the true Constitution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the State and Interest of the Clergy; as sufficiently ap∣pear'd throughout the whole course of his life afterward.</P>
<P>HE had scarce perform'd any part of the office of a Bishop in the Dio∣cess of <HI>London,</HI> when he was snatch'd from thence, and promoted to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> upon the never-enough lamented death of D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bancrost</HI> that Metropolitan, who understood the Church excellently, and had allmost <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> rescued it out of the hands of the <HI>Calvinian</HI> Party, and very much sub∣dued the unruly Spirit of the Non-conformists, by, and after the Con∣ference at <HI>Hampton-Court;</HI> countenanced men of the greatest parts in Learning, and disposed the Clergy to a more solid course of Study, than they had been accustom'd to; and, if he had liv'd, would quickly have extinguish'd all that Fire in <HI>England,</HI> which had been kindled at <HI>Geneva;</HI> or if he had been succeeded by Bishop <HI>Andrews,</HI> Bishop <HI>Overal,</HI> or any man who understood, and loved the Church, that Infection would ea∣sily have been kept out, which could not afterwards be so easily expell'd.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Abbot</HI> brought none of this Antidote with him, and consider'd <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Christian Religion no otherwise, than as it abhor'd, and reviled Popery, and valued those men most, who did That the most furiously. For the strict observation of the Discipline of the Church, or the conformity to
<PB N="69" REF="950"/>
the Articles, or Canons establish'd, he made little enquiry, and took less care; and having himself made a very little progress in the Ancient, and Solid study of Divinity, he adhered only to the Doctrine of <HI>Calvin,</HI> and, for His sake, did not think so ill of the Discipline as he ought to have done. But if men prudently forbore a publick reviling, and railing at the Hierarchy, and Ecclesiastical Government, let their opinions, and pri∣vate practice be what it would, they were not only secure from any in∣quisition of his, but acceptable to him, and, at least, equally prefer'd by him. And though many other Bishops plainly discern'd the Mischiefs, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> which daily broke in to the Prejudice of Religion, by his defects and re∣missness, and prevented it in their own Diocesses as much as they could, and gave all their countenance to men of other Parts, and other Prin∣ciples; and though the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Laud,</HI> from the time of his Authority and Credit with the King had applied all the Remedies he could to those Defections, and, from the time of his being Chancellor of <HI>Oxford,</HI> had much discountenanced, and allmost suppress'd that Spirit, by encouraging another kind of Learning, and Practice in that Univer∣sity, which was indeed according to the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> yet that temper in the Arch-Bishop, whose House was a Sanctuary <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to the most Eminent of that Factious Party, and who Licensed their most Pernicious Writings, left his Successor a very difficult work to do, to Reform, and reduce a Church into Order, that had been so long neglected, and that was so ill fill'd by many weak, and more wilful Church-men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop Laud made Arch-Bishop: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Character</NOTE> IT was within one week after the King's return from <HI>Scotland,</HI> that <HI>Abbot</HI> died at his House at <HI>Lambeth.</HI> The King took very little time to consider who should be his Successor, but the very next time the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> (who was longer on his way home than the King had been) came to him, his Majesty entertain'd him very chearfully with this Com∣peliation, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> <HI>My Lord's Grace of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>You are very welcome,</HI> and gave order the same day for the dispatch of all the necessary forms for the Translation: so that within a month or thereabouts after the death of the other Arch-Bishop, he was compleatly invested in that high Digni∣ty, and settled in his Palace at <HI>Lambeth.</HI> This great Prelate had been before in great favour with the Duke of <HI>Buchingham,</HI> whose chief Con∣fident he was, and by him recommended to the King, as fittest to be trusted in the conferring all Ecclesiastical Preferments, when he was but Bishop of <HI>Saint Davids,</HI> or newly prefer'd to <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells;</HI> and from that time he entirely govern'd that province, without a rival: so that his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> promotion to <HI>Canterbury</HI> was long foreseen and expected; nor was it at∣tended with any increase of envy or dislike.</P>
<P>HE was a man of great Parts, and very exemplary Virtues, allay'd and discredited by some unpopular natural Infirmities; the greatest of which was (besides a hasty, sharp way of expressing himself) that he believ'd Innocence of heart, and Integrity of manners, was a guard strong enough to secure any man in his voyage through this world, in what Company soever he travell'd, and through what Ways soever he was to pass: and sure never any man was better supplied with that Provision. He was born of honest Parents, who were well able to provide for his educa∣tion <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in the Schools of Learning, from whence they sent him to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Johns</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> the worst endow'd at that time of any in that famous University. From a Scholar he became a Fellow, and then the President of the College, after he had receiv'd all the graces and degrees (the
<PB N="70" REF="960"/>
Proctorship, and the Doctorship) could be obtain'd there. He was all∣ways maligned, and persecuted by those who were of the <HI>Calvinian</HI> Faction, which was then very powerful, and who, according to their usual maxim and practice, call every man they do not love, Papist; and, under this senseless appellation, they created him many troubles and vexations; and so far suppress'd him, that though he was the King's Chaplain, and taken notice of for an excellent Preacher, and a Scholar of the most sublime Parts, he had not any Preferment to invite him to leave his poor College, which only gave him bread, till the vigour of his age was past; and when he was promoted by King <HI>James,</HI> it was but to a <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> poor Bishoprick in <HI>Wales,</HI> which was not so good a Support for a Bishop, as his College was for a private Scholar, though a Doctor.</P>
<P>PARLIAMENTS in that time were frequent, and grew very busy, and the party, under which he had suffer'd a continual Persecution, ap∣pear'd very powerful, and full of design, and They, who had the courage to Oppose them, begun to be taken notice of with approbation and countenance: under this Style he came to be first cherish'd by the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had made some experiments of the temper and spirit of the Other people, nothing to his satisfaction. From this time he prosper'd at the rate of his own wishes, and being transplanted out of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> his cold barren Diocess of <HI>Saint Davids,</HI> into a warmer Climate, he was left, as was said before, by that great Favourite in that great Trust with the King; who was sufficiently indisposed towards the Persons, or the Principles of <HI>Calvin's</HI> Disciples.</P>
<P>WHEN he came into great Authority, it may be, he retain'd too keen a memory of Those, who had so unjustly, and uncharitably Persecuted him before; and, I doubt, was so far transported with the same Passions, he had reason to complain of in his Adversaries, that, as they accused Him of Popery, because he had some doctrinal Opinions, which they liked not, though they were nothing ally'd to Popery; so he entertain'd <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> too much prejudice to some Persons, as if They were Enemies to the Discipline of the Church, because they concur'd with <HI>Calvin</HI> in some doctrinal Points; when they abhor'd his Discipline, and reverenced the Government of the Church, and pray'd for the Peace of it with as much zeal and fervency as any in the Kingdom; as they made manifest in their Lives, and in their Sufferings with it, and for it. He had, from his first entrance into the world, without any disguise or dissimulation, de∣clared his own opinion of that Classis of men, and, as soon as it was in his power, he did all he could to hinder the growth, and increase of that Faction, and to restrain Those, who were inclined to it, from doing the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> mischief they desired to do. But his Power at Court could not enough qualify him to go through with that difficult Reformation, whilst he had a Superior in the Church, who, having the Reins in His hand, could Slacken them according to his own humour and indiscretion; and was thought to be the more remiss, to irritate his cholerick disposition. But when he had now the Primacy in his own hand, the King being inspired with the same Zeal, he thought he should be to blame, and have much to answer for, if he did not make hast to apply Remedies to those Disea∣ses, which he saw would grow apace.</P>
<P>IN the end of <HI>September</HI> of the year 1633, he was invested in the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Title, Power, and Jurisdiction of Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and en∣tirely in possession of the Revenue thereof, without a Rival in Church or State; that is, no man Profess'd to oppose his Greatness; and he had
<PB N="71" REF="970"/>
never interposed or appear'd in Matters of State to this time. His first<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Juxon made Bishop of London.</NOTE> Care was, that the Place, he was removed from, might be supplied with a Man who would be vigilant to pull up those Weeds, which the <HI>London</HI> Soil was too apt to nourish, and so drew his old Friend and Companion D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Juxon,</HI> as near to him as he could. They had been Fellows together in one College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and, when he was first made Bishop of <HI>Saint Davids,</HI> he made him President of that College: when he could no longer keep the Deanery of the Chappel-Royal, he made him his Succes∣sor in that near Attendance upon the King: and now he was raised to be <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Arch-Bishop, he easily prevail'd with the King to make the other, Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> before, or very soon after he had been Consecrated Bishop of <HI>Hereford,</HI> if he were more than Elect of that Church.</P>
<P>IT was now a time of great Ease and Tranquillity; the King (as hath been said before) had made himself Superior to all those Difficul∣ties and Streights, he had to contend with the four first years he came to the Crown at Home; and was now Reverenced by all his Neigh∣bours, who needed his Friendship, and desired to have it; the Wealth of the Kingdom notorious to all the world, and the general Temper, and Humour of it, little inclined to the Papist, and less to the Puritan. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> There were some late Taxes and Impositions introduced, which rather angred than griev'd the People, who were more than repair'd by the Quiet, Peace, and Prosperity they enjoy'd; and the Murmur and Dis∣content, that was, appear'd to be against the Excess of Power exercised by the Crown, and supported by the Judges in <HI>Westminster</HI>-Hall. The Church was not repined at, nor the least inclination to alter the Govern∣ment, and Discipline thereof, or to change the Doctrine. Nor was there at that time any considerable number of Persons of any valuable Condi∣tion throughout the Kingdom, who did wish either; and the cause of so prodigious a Change in so few years after was too visible from the effects. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> The Arch-Bishop's heart was set upon the Advancement of the Church, in which he well knew, he had the King's full Concurrence, which he thought would be too powerful for any opposition; and that he should need no other assistance.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Nation generally, as was said before, was without any ill talent to the Church, either in the point of the Doctrine, or the Discipline, yet they were not without a jealousy that Popery was not enough discountenanced, and were very averse from admitting any thing they had not been used to, which they call'd Innovation, and were easily perswaded, that any thing of that kind was but to please the Papists. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Some doctrinal Points in Controversy had been, in the late years, agi∣tated<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warm Conten∣tions concern∣ing those call'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Points.</NOTE> in the Pulpits with more warmth and reflections, than had used to be; and thence the heat, and animosity increased in Books <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> upon the same Arguments: most of the popular Preachers, who had not look'd into the Ancient Learning, took <HI>Calvin's</HI> word for it, and did all they could to propagate his Opinions in those Points: they, who had studied more, and were better versed in the Antiquities of the Church, the Fathers, the Councils, and the Ecclesiastical Histories, with the same heat and passion in Preaching and Writing defended the contrary.</P>
<P>BUT because in the late Dispute in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Churches, those Opi∣nions <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> were supported by <HI>Jacobus Arminius,</HI> the Divinity Professor in the University of <HI>Leyden</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> the latter men, we mention'd, were call'd <HI>Arminians;</HI> though many of them had never read a word written by <HI>Arminius.</HI> Either side defended, and maintain'd the different Opinions
<PB N="72" REF="980"/>
as the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as the two great Orders in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> and <HI>Franciscans</HI> did at the same time, and had many hundred years before, with more vehemence and uncharitableness, maintain'd the same Opinions one against the other; either Party professing to adhere to the Doctrine of the Catholick Church, which had been ever wiser than to Determine the Controversy. And yet that Party here, which could least support themselves with Reason, were very sollicitous, according to the Ingenuity they allways practice to advance any of their Pretences, to have the People believe, that they who held with <HI>Arminius</HI> did intend to introduce Popery; and truly the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> other Side was no less willing to have it thought, that all, who adhered to <HI>Calvin</HI> in those Controversies, did in their Hearts likewise adhere to him with reference to the Discipline, and desired to change the Govern∣ment of the Church, destroy the Bishops, and to set up the Discipline that he had establish'd at <HI>Geneva;</HI> and so both Sides found such reception generally with the People, as they were inclined to the Persons; where∣as, in truth, none of the one side were at all inclined to Popery, and very many of the Other were most affectionate to the Peace and Pro∣sperity of the Church, and very Pious, and Learned men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> THE Arch-Bishop had, all his life, eminently opposed <HI>Calvin's</HI> Do∣ctrine <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in those Controversies, before the name of <HI>Arminius</HI> was taken notice of, or his Opinions heard of; and thereupon for want of another Name, they had call'd him a Papist, which nobody believ'd him to be, and he had more manifested the contrary in his Disputations, and Wri∣tings, than most men had done; and it may be the other found the more severe, and rigorous Usage from him, for their propagating that Calumny against him. He was a man of great Courage and Resolution, and being most assured within himself, that he proposed no end in all his actions and designs, but what was Pious and Just (as sure no man had ever a heart more entire to the King, the Church, or his Country) he never <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> studied the easiest ways to those ends; he thought, it may be, that any art or industry that way would discredit, at least make the Integrity of the end suspected, let the cause be what it will. He did court Persons too little; nor cared to make his designs, and purposes, appear as candid as they were, by shewing them in any other dress than their own natural beauty, though perhaps in too rough a manner; and did not consider enough what men said, or were like to say of him. If the Faults, and Vices were fit to be look'd into, and discover'd, let the Persons be who they would that were guilty of them, they were sure to find no conni∣vance of Favour from him. He intended the Discipline of the Church <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> should be felt, as well as spoken of, and that it should be applied to the greatest and most splendid Transgressors, as well as to the punishment of smaller Offences, and meaner Offenders; and thereupon call'd for, or cherish'd the discovery of Those, who were not careful to cover their own Iniquities, thinking they were above the reach of other Men, or their Power, or Will to chastise. Persons of Honour, and great Quality of the Court, and of the Country, were every day cited into the High-Commission Court, upon the fame of their Incontinence, or other Scan∣dal in their lives, and were there prosecuted to their Shame, and Punish∣ment: and as the Shame (which they call'd an Insolent Triumph upon <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> their Degree and Quality, and levelling Them with the common Peo∣ple) was never forgotten, but watch'd for revenge; so the Fines imposed there were the more question'd, and repined against, because they were
<PB N="73" REF="990"/>
assign'd to the rebuilding, and repairing S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church; and thought therefore to be the more Severely imposed, and the less Compassionately reduced and excused: which likewise made the jurisdiction, and rigour of the Star-Chamber more felt, and murmur'd against, and sharpned many mens humours against the Bishops, before they had any ill inten∣tion towards the Church.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pryn, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> Bartwick</NOTE> THERE were three Persons most notorious for their declared Malice against the Government of the Church by Bishops, in their several Books, and Writings, which they had publish'd to Corrupt the People, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> with circumstances very Scandalous, and in language very Scurrilous, and Impudent; which all men thought deserv'd very exemplary Punish∣ment: they were of the three several Professions which had the most influence upon the People, a Divine, a Common Lawyer, and a Doctor of Physick; none of them of interest, or any esteem with the worthy part of their several Professions, having been formerly all look'd upon under Characters of Reproach: yet when they were all Sentenced, and for the execution of that Sentence brought out to be Punish'd as common, and signal Rogues, exposed upon Scaffolds to have their Ears cut off, and their Faces and Foreheads branded with hot Irons (as the poorest, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> most mechanick Malefactors used to be, when they were not able to re∣deem themselves by any Fine for their Trespasses, or to satisfy and dama∣ges for the Scandals they had raised against the good name, and reputation of others) men begun no more to consider their Manners, but the Men; and each Profession, with anger and indignation enough, thought their Education, and Degrees, and Quality, would have secured them from such Infamous Judgements, and treasured up Wrath for the time to come.</P>
<P>THE remissness of <HI>Abbot</HI> and of other Bishops by his example, had introduced, or at least connived at a Negligence, that gave great scandal <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to the Church, and no doubt offended very many Pious men. The Peo∣ple took so little care of the Churches, and the Parsons as little of the Chancels, that, instead of beautifying, or adorning them in any degree, they rarely provided against the falling of many of their Churches; and suffer'd them at least to be kept so indecently, and slovenly, that they would not have endured it in the ordinary offices of their own Houses; the Rain and the Wind to infest them; and the Sacraments themselves to be administred where the People had most mind to receive them. This Prophane liberty and uncleanliness, the Arch-Bishop resolv'd to Reform with all expedition, requiring the other Bishops to concur with him in <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> so Pious a work; and the work sure was very Grateful to all men of De∣votion: yet, I know not how, the Prosecution of it with too much affe∣ctation of Expence, it may be, or with too much Passion between the Ministers and the Parishioners, raised an evil Spirit towards the Church, which the Enemies of it took much advantage of, as soon as they had an opportunity to make the worst use of it.</P>
<P>THE removing the Communion Table out of the body of the Church, where it had used to stand, and to be applied to all uses, and fixing it to one place in the upper end of the Chancel, which frequently made the buying a new Table to be necessary; the inclosing it with a Rail of Joiners <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> work, and thereby fencing it from the approach of Dogs, and all Servile uses; the obliging all Persons to come up to those Rails to receive the Sa∣crament, how acceptable soever to grave and intelligent Persons, who lov'd Order and Decency (for acceptable it was to such) yet introduced
<PB N="74" REF="1000"/>
first Murmurings amongst the People, upon the very Charge and Ex∣pence of it; and if the Minister were not a man of discretion and repu∣tation to compose, and reconcile those Indispositions (as too frequent∣ly he was not, and rather inflamed, and increased the Distemper) it be∣got Suits, and Appeals at Law. The opinion that there was no Necessi∣ty of doing any thing, and the complaint that there was too Much done, brought the Power and Jurisdiction, that imposed the doing of it, to be call'd in question, contradicted, and opposed. Then the manner, and gesture, and posture, in the Celebration of it, brought in new Disputes, and administred new subjects of Offence, according to the custom of the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Place, and humour of the People: and those Disputes brought in new words and terms (Altar, Adoration, and Genuflexion, and other expres∣sions) for the more perspicuous carrying on those Disputations. New Books were written for, and against this new Practice, with the same earnestness, and contention for Victory, as if the Life of Christianity had been at stake. Besides, there was not an equal Concurrence, in the pro∣secution of this matter, amongst the Bishops themselves; some of them proceeding more remissly in it, and some not only neglecting to direct any thing to be done towards it, but restraining those who had a mind to it, from meddling in it. And this again produced as inconvenient <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Disputes, when the Subordinate Clergy would take upon them, not on∣ly without the direction of their Diocesans, but expresly against their Injunctions, to make those Alterations and Reformations themselves, and by their own authority.</P>
<P>THE Arch-Bishop guided purely by his zeal, and reverence for the Place of God's Service, and by the Canons, and Injunctions of the Church, with the custom observ'd in the King's Chappel, and in most Cathedral-Churches, without considering the long intermission, and dis∣continuance, in many other Places, prosecuted this Affair more Passio∣nately than was fit for the season; and had Prejudice against Those, who <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> out of fear, or foresight, or not understanding the Thing, had not the same Warmth to promote it. The Bishops who had been prefer'd by his Favour, or hoped to be so, were at least as Sollicitous to bring it to pass in their several Diocesses; and some of them with more Passion, and less Circumspection, than they had his Example for, or than he Approved; prosecuting Those, who opposed them, very Fiercely, and sometimes Unwarrantably, which was kept in Remembrance. Whilst other Bi∣shops, not so many in number, or so valuable in weight, who had not been Beholding to him, nor had hope of being so, were enough contented to give Perfunctory orders for the doing it, and to see the Execution of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> those orders not minded; and not the less pleased to find, that the Prejudice of that whole Transaction reflected solely upon the Arch-Bishop.</P>
<P>THE Bishop of <HI>Lincoln (Williams)</HI> who had heretofore been Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> and generally unacceptable whilst he held that Office, was, since his disgrace at Court, and prosecution from thence, become very Popular; and having several Faults objected to him, the Punishment whereof threatned him every day, he was very willing to change the Scene, and to be brought upon the Stage for op∣posing these Innovations (as he call'd them) in Religion. It was an un∣lucky <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> word, and couzen'd very many honest men into apprehensions very Prejudicial to the King, and to the Church. He Publish'd a Di∣scourse and Treatise against the matter, and manner of the Prosecution
<PB N="75" REF="1010"/>
of that Business; a Book so full of good Learning, and that Learning so close, and solidly applied (though it abounded with too many light ex∣pressions) that it gain'd him reputation enough to be able to do Hurt; and shew'd that, in his retirement, he had spent his time with his Books very profitably. He used all the Wit, and all the Malice he could, to awaken the People to a jealousy of these Agitations, and Innovations in the exercise of Religion; not without Insinuations that it aim'd at greater Alterations, for which he knew the People would quickly find a name; and he was ambitious to have it believ'd, that the Arch-Bishop <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> was his greatest Enemy, for his having constantly opposed his rising to any Government in the Church, as a man, whose hot and hasty Spirit he had long known.</P>
<P>THOUGH there were other Books written with good learning, and which sufficiently answer'd the Bishop's book, and to men of equal, and dispassionate Inclinations, fully vindicated the Proceedings which had been, and were still very fervently carried on; yet it was done by Men, whose names were not much reverenced, and who were taken notice of, with great insolence and asperity to undertake the Defence of all things which the People generally were Displeased with, and who did not affect <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to be much Cared for, by those of their own Order. So that from this unhappy Subject, not in it self of that important value to be either entred upon with that Resolution, or to be carried on with that Passion, proceeded upon the matter a Schism amongst the Bishops themselves, and a great deal of Uncharitableness in the learned, and moderate Cler∣gy, towards one another: which, though it could not increase the ma∣lice, added very much to the ability and power of the Enemies of the Church to do it hurt, and also to the number of them. For without doubt, many who lov'd the establish'd Government of the Church, and the Exercise of Religion as it was used, and desired not a change in ei∣ther, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> nor did dislike the order and decency which they saw mended, yet they liked not any Novelties, and so were liable to entertain Jealousies that more was intended, than was hitherto proposed; especially when those Infusions proceeded from Men unsuspected to have any incli∣nations to Change, and known Assertors of the Government both in Church and State. They did observe the Inferior Clergy took more upon them, than they were wont, and did not live towards their Neighbours of Quality, or their Patrons themselves, with that Civili∣ty and Condescension, they had used to do; which disposed Them like∣wise to a withdrawing their good Countenance, and good Neighbour∣hood <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> from them.</P>
<P>THE Arch-Bishop had not been long in that Post, when there was an∣other great alteration in the Court by the Death of the Earl of <HI>Port∣land,</HI> High Treasurer of <HI>England;</HI> a man so jealous of the Arch-Bishop's credit with the King, that he allways endeavour'd to lessen it by all the arts and ways he could; which he was so far from effecting, that, as it usually falls out, when passion and malice make Accusation, by suggest∣ing many Particulars which the King knew to be Untrue, or believ'd to be no Faults, he rather confirm'd his Majesty's judgement of him, and prejudiced his own reputation. His death caused no grief in the Arch-Bishop;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI>'s death the Arch-Bishop made one of the Commis∣sioners of the Treasury</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> who was, upon it, made one of the Commissioners of the Trea∣sury, and Revenue, which he had reason to be sorry for, because it en∣gaged him in Civil business, and matters of State, wherein he had little experience, and which he had hitherto avoided. But being obliged to it
<PB N="76" REF="1020"/>
now by his Trust, he entred upon it with his natural earnestness and warmth, making it his principal care to advance, and improve the King's Revenue, by all the ways which were offer'd, and so hearken'd to all Informations and Propositions of that kind; and having not had expe∣rience of that Tribe of people, who deal in that Traffick (a confident, senseless, and for the most part a naughty people) he was sometimes mis∣led by them, to think better of some Projects than they deserv'd: but then he was so entirely devoted to what would be Beneficial to the King, that all Propositions and Designs, which were for the Profit (only or principally) of particular Persons how Great soever, were opposed, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> cross'd, and very often totally suppress'd, and stifled in their birth, by his Power, and Authority; which created him Enemies enough in the Court, and many of Ability to do Mischief, who knew well how to recompense Discourtesies, which they allways call'd Injuries.</P>
<P>THE Revenue of too Many of the Court consisted principally in En∣closures, and Improvements of that nature, which He still opposed pas∣sionately, except they were founded upon Law; and then, if it would bring Profit to the King, how old and obsolete soever the Law was, he thought he might justly advise the Prosecution. And so he did a little too much countenance the Commission concerning Depopulation, which <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> brought much charge and trouble upon the People, and was likewise cast upon His account.</P>
<P>HE had observ'd, and knew it must be so, that the Principal Offi∣cers of the Revenue, who govern'd the affairs of Money, had allways access to the King, and spent more time with him in Private than any of his Servants, or Counsellors, and had thereby frequent opportunities to do Good, or Ill offices to many men; of which He had Experience, when the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> was Treasurer, and the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> Chancellor of the Exchequer; neither of them being his Friends; and the latter still enjoying his Place, and having his former Access, and so <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> continuing a joint Commissioner of the Treasury with him, and under∣standing that Province much better, still Opposed, and commonly Car∣ried every thing against him: so that he was Weary of the toil, and vexation of that Business; as all other men were, and still are of the De∣lays, which are in all dispatches in that Office, whilst it is executed by Commission.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord Treasurer.</NOTE> THE Treasurer's is the greatest Office of Benefit in the Kingdom, and the Chief in Precedence next the Arch-Bishop's, and the Great Seal: so that the eyes of all men were at gaze who should have this great Office; and the greatest of the Nobility, who were in the chiefest Employ∣ments, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> look'd upon it as the Prize of one of them; such Offices com∣monly making way for more Removes, and Preferments: when on a suddain the Staff was put into the hands of the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> a man so unknown, that his Name was scarce heard of in the Kingdom, who had been, within two years before, but a private Chaplain to the King, and the President of a poor College in <HI>Oxford.</HI> This Inflamed more men than were Angry before, and no doubt did not only sharpen the edge of Envy and Malice against the Arch-Bishop (who was the known Architect of this new Fabrick) but most unjustly Indisposed many to∣wards the Church it self; which they look'd upon as the Gulph ready to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> swallow all the great Offices, there being Others in view, of that Robe, who were ambitious enough to expect the rest.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the Arch-Bishop himself was infinitely pleased with
<PB N="77" REF="1030"/>
what was done, and unhappily believ'd he had provided a stronger Sup∣port for the Church; and never abated any thing of his Severity, and Rigour towards men of all conditions; or in the Sharpness of his lan∣guage, and expressions, which was so natural to him, that he could not debate any thing without some Commotion, when the Argument was not of moment, nor bear Contradiction in debate, even in the Council, where all men are equally free, with that Patience, and Temper that was necessary; of which, They who wish'd him not well, took many Advan∣tages, and would therefore Contradict him, that he might be transported <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> with some Indecent Passion; which, upon a short recollection, he was allways Sorry for, and most readily, and heartily would make Acknow∣ledgement. No man so willingly made unkind use of all those Occasions, as the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> who, being a master of Temper, and of the most profound Dissimulation, knew too well how to lead him into a Mistake, and then drive him into Choler, and then Expose him upon the matter, and the manner, to the judgement of the Company; and he chose to do this most, when the King was present; and then he would Dine with him the next day.</P>
<P>THE King, who was excessively affected to Hunting, and the Sports <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of the Field, had a great desire to make a great Park for Red, as well as Fallow Deer, between <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> where he had large Wasts of his own, and great parcels of Wood, which made it very fit for the use he design'd it to: but as some Parishes had Commons in those Wasts, so, many Gentlemen, and Farmers, had good Houses, and good Farms intermingled with those Wasts of their own Inheritance, or for their Lives, or Years; and without taking of Them into the Park, it would not be of the largeness, or for the use proposed. His Majesty desired to purchase those Lands, and was very willing to buy them upon higher terms, than the People could sell them at to any body else, if they <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> had occasion to part with them, and thought it no unreasonable thing, upon those terms, to expect this from his Subjects; and so he employ'd his own Surveyor, and other of his Officers, to treat with the Owners, many whereof were his own Tenants, whose Farms would at last expire.</P>
<P>THE major part of the People were in a short time prevail'd with, but many very obstinately refused; and a Gentleman, who had the best Estate, with a convenient House, and Gardens, would by no means part with it; and the King being as earnest to compass it, it made a great noise, as if the King would take away mens Estates at his own pleasure. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> The Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> who was Treasurer, and the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> Chancellor of the Exchequer, were, from the first entring upon it, very averse from the Design, not only for the murmur of the People, but be∣cause the purchase of the Land, and the making a Brick-wall about so large a parcel of Ground (for it is near ten Miles about) would cost a greater Sum of money, than they could easily provide, or than they thought ought to be sacrificed to Such an occasion: and the Lord <HI>Cot∣tington</HI> (who was more sollicited by the Country people, and heard most of their murmurs) took the Business most to heart, and endeavour'd by all the ways he could, and by frequent importunities, to divert his Ma∣jesty <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> from pursuing it, and put all delays, he could well do, in the bar∣gains which were to be made; till the King grew very angry with him, and told him <Q>“”he was resolv'd to go through with it, and had all∣ready caused Brick to be burn'd, and much of the Wall to be built
<PB N="78" REF="1040"/>
upon his Own land:</Q> upon which <HI>Cottington</HI> thought fit to acquiesce.</P>
<P>THE building the Wall before People consented to part with their Land, or their Common, look'd to them as if by degrees they should be Shut out from both, and increased the murmur and noise of the People who were Not concern'd, as well as of them who were: and it was too near <HI>London</HI> not to be the common discourse. The Arch-Bishop (who desired exceedingly that the King should be possess'd as much of the Hearts of the People as was possible, at least that they should have no just cause to Complain) meeting with it, resolv'd to Speak with the King of it; which he did; and receiv'd such an Answer from him, that he <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> thought his Majesty rather not inform'd enough of the Inconveniencies, and Mischiefs of the thing, than positively Resolv'd not to desist from it. Whereupon one day he took the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> aside (being in∣form'd that he disliked it, and, according to his natural custom, spake with great warmth against it) and told him, <Q>“”he should do very well to give the King good Counsel, and to withdraw him from a Resolution, in which his Honour,</Q> and Justice was so much call'd in question. <HI>Cot∣tington</HI> answer'd him very gravely, <Q>“”that the thing design'd was very Lawful, and he thought the King resolv'd very well, since the Place lay so conveniently for his Winter exercise, and that he should by it <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> not be compell'd to make so long Journeys, as he used to do, in that Sea∣son of the year, for his Sport, and that nobody ought to disswade him from it.</Q></P>
<P>THE Arch-Bishop instead of finding a Concurrence from him, as he expected, seeing himself Reproach'd upon the matter for his Opinion, grew into much Passion, telling him, <Q>“”Such men, as he, would Ruin the King, and make him loose the Affections of his Subjects; that for his own part, as he had begun, so he would go on to disswade the King from proceeding in so Ill a counsel, and that he hoped it would appear who had been his Counsellor.</Q> <HI>Cottington</HI> glad to see him so soon hot, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and resolv'd to inflame him more, very calmly replied to him, <Q>“”that he thought a man could not, with a good Conscience, hinder the King from pursuing his Resolutions, and that it could not but proceed from want of affection to his Person, and he was not sure, that it might not be high Treason.</Q> The other, upon the wildness of his discourse, in great anger ask'd him, <Q>“”Why? from whence he had receiv'd that do∣ctrine? he said, with the same temper, "They who did not wish the King's health, could not love him; and they, who went about to hin∣der his taking recreation, which preserv'd his health, might be thought, for ought he knew,</Q> guilty of the highest Crimes. Upon which the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Arch-Bishop in great rage, and with many reproaches left him, and ei∣ther presently, or upon the next opportunity told the King, <Q>“”that he now knew who was his great Counsellor for making his Park, and that he did not wonder that men durst not represent any Arguments to the contrary, or let his Majesty know how much he Suffer'd in it, when such Principles in Divinity,</Q> and Law, were laid down to Terrify them; and so recounted to him the Conference he had with the Lord <HI>Cotting∣ton,</HI> bitterly inveighing against Him, and his Doctrine, mentioning him with all the sharp Reproaches imaginable, and beseeching his Majesty "that His counsel might not Prevail with him, taking some pains to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> make his Conclusions appear very False, and Ridiculous.</P>
<P>THE King said no more, but, <Q>“”My Lord, you are deceiv'd, <HI>Cotting∣ton</HI> is too hard for you; upon my word he hath not only Disswaded me
<PB N="79" REF="1050"/>
more, and given more Reason against this Business, than all the men in <HI>England</HI> have done, but hath really obstructed the Work by not doing his Duty, as I commanded him, for which I have been very much dis∣pleased with him: you see how Unjustly your Passion hath transported you.</Q> By which Reprehension he found how much he had been Abused, and Resented it accordingly.</P>
<P>WHATSOEVER was the Cause of it, this excellent Man, who stood not upon the advantage ground before, from the time of his Promotion to the Arch-Bishoprick, or rather from that of his being Commissioner <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of the Treasury, exceedingly provoked, or underwent the Envy, and Reproach, and Malice of men of all Qualities, and Conditions; who agreed in nothing else: all which, though well enough Known to him, were not enough Consider'd by him, who believ'd, as most men did, the Government to be so firmly Settled, that it could neither be Shaken from within, nor without, and that less than a general Confusion of Law and Gospel, could not hurt him; which was true too; but he did not Foresee how easily that Confusion might be brought to pass, as it proved shortly to be. And with this general Observation of the out∣ward visible Prosperity, and the inward reserv'd disposition of the People <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to Murmur, and Unquietness, we Conclude this First Book.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Scotland</HI> after the King's re∣turn thence, relating chiefly to the compo∣sing a Liturgy and Canons.</NOTE> <SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was towards the end of the Year 1633, when the King return'd from <HI>Scotland,</HI> having left it to the Care of some of the Bi∣shops there to provide such a Liturgy, and such a Book of Canons, as might best suit the nature and humour of the Better sort of that People; to which the rest would easily sub∣mit: and that, as fast as they made them ready, they should transmit them to the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to whose assi∣stance the King joyn'd the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Wren,</HI> who, by that time, was become Bishop of <HI>Norwich;</HI> a man of a severe, sowr nature, but very Learned, and particularly versed in the old Liturgies of the <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Churches. And after his Majesty should be this way certified of what was so sent, he would recommend, and enjoyn the Practice and Use of both to that his Native Kingdom. The Bishops there had somewhat to do, before they went about the preparing the Canons, and the Liturgy; what had pass'd at the King's being there in Parliament, had left bitter Inclinations, and unruly Spirits in many of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the most popular Nobility; who watch'd only for an opportunity to inflame the People, and were well-enough contented to see Combustible matter every day gather'd together, to contribute to that Fire.</P>
<P>THE promoting so many Bishops to be of the Privy-Council, and to sit in the Courts of Justice, seem'd at first wonderfully to facilitate all
<PB N="84" REF="1080"/>
that was in design, and to create an affection and reverence towards the Church, at least an application to and dependence upon the greatest Church-men. So that there seem'd to be not only a good preparation made with the People, but a general expectation, and even a desire that they might have a Liturgy, and more Decency observ'd in the Church. And this Temper was believ'd to be the more universal, because neither from any of the Nobility, nor of the Clergy, who were thought most averse from it, there appear'd any sign of Contradiction, nor that licence of Language against it, as was natural to that Nation; but an entire Ac∣quiescence in all the Bishops thought fit to do; which was interpreted <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to proceed from a conversion in their Judgement, at least to a submission to Authority: whereas in truth, it appear'd afterwards to be from the observation they made of the Temper, and Indiscretion of those Bishops in the greatest Authority, that they were like to have more Advantages administred to them by Their ill Managery, than they could raise by any Contrivance of their own.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Touching the <HI>Scotish</HI> Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></NOTE> IT was now two Years, or very near so much, before the Bishops in <HI>Scotland</HI> had prepared any thing to offer to the King towards their in∣tended Reformation; and then they Inverted the proper method, and first presented a body of Canons to precede the Liturgy, which was not yet <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> ready, they choosing to finish the shorter work first. The King refer'd the consideration of the Canons, as he had before resolv'd to do, to the Arch-Bishop, and the other two Bishops formerly named, the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Norwich;</HI> who, after their perusal of them, and some Alterations made, with the consent of those Bishops who brought them from <HI>Scotland,</HI> return'd them to the King; and his Ma∣jesty, impatient to see the good work entred upon▪ without any other Ceremony (after having given his Royal approbation) issued out his Pro∣clamation for the due Observation of them within his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>IT was a fatal Inadvertency that these Canons, neither before, nor af∣ter they were sent to the King, had been ever Seen by the Assembly, or any Convocation of the Clergy, which was so strictly obliged to the Observation of them; nor so much as Communicated to the Lords of the Council of that Kingdom; it being allmost impossible that any new Discipline could be introduced into the Church, which would not Much concern the Government of the State, and even trench upon, or refer to the Muncipal Laws of the Kingdom. And, in this consideration, the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> had allways declared to the Bishops of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> <Q>“”that it was Their part to be sure, that nothing they should pro∣pose <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to the King in the Business of the Church, should be contrary to the Laws of the Land, which He could not be thought to understand; and that they should never put any thing in execution, without the consent and approbation of the Privy-Council.</Q> But it was the unhappy Craft of those Bishops to get it believ'd by the King, that the work would be Grateful to the most considerable of the Nobility, the Clergy, and the People (which they could hardly believe) in order to the obtaining his Majesty's Approbation, and Authority for the execution of that, which they did really believe would not find Opposition from the Nobility, Clergy, or People, against his Majesty's express Power, and Will, which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> without doubt was then in great Veneration in that Kingdom; and so they did not, in truth, dare to submit those Canons to any other Exami∣nation, than what the King should direct in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="1090"/>
IT was, in the next place, as strange, that Canons should be publish'd before the Liturgy was prepared (which was not ready in a year after, or thereabouts) when three or four of the Canons were principally for the Observation of, and punctual Compliance with the Liturgy; which all the Clergy were to be sworn to submit to, and to pay all obedience to what was enjoyn'd by it, before they knew what it contain'd. Whereas if the Liturgy had been first publish'd with all due Circumstances, it is possible that it might have found a better reception, and the Canons have been less examin'd.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> THE <HI>Scotish</HI> Nation, how capable soever it was of being led by some Great men, and misled by the Clergy, would have been corrupted by neither into a barefaced Rebellion against their King, whose Person they lov'd, and reverenced his Government; nor could they have been wrought upon towards the lessening the one, or the other, by any other Suggestions, or Infusions, than such as should make them jealous, or ap∣prehensive of a design to introduce Popery; a great part of their Reli∣gion consisting in an entire detestation of Popery, in believing the Pope to be Antichrist, and hating perfectly the Persons of all Papists.</P>
<P>THE Canons now publish'd, besides (as hath been touch'd before) that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> they had pass'd no Approbation of the Clergy, or been Communicated to the Council, appear'd to be so many new Laws imposed upon the whole Kingdom by the King's sole Authority, and contrived by a few Private men, of whom they had no good opinion, and who were Strangers to the Nation; so that it was thought no other than a Subjection to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> by receiving Laws from thence, of which they were most jealous, and which they most passionately abhor'd. Then they were so far from being confined to the Church, and the matters of Religion, that they believ'd there was no part of their Civil Government uninvaded by them, and no Persons of what Quality soever unconcern'd, and, as they <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> thought, unhurt in them. And there were some things in some parti∣cular Canons, how rational soever in themselves, and how distant soever in the words and expressions from inclining to Popery, which yet gave too much advantage to Those who maliciously watch'd the occasion, to perswade Weak men that it was an Approach, and Introduction to that Religion, the very Imagination whereof Intoxicated all men, and de∣prived them of all faculties to Examine, and Judge.</P>
<P>SOME of the said Canons defined, and determin'd such an unlimited <Q>“”Power, and Prerogative to be in the King, according to the Pattern (in express terms) "of the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> and such a full Supremacy in <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> all Cases Ecclesiastical, as hath never been pretended to by their former Kings,</Q> or submitted to by the Clergy, and Laity of that Nation; which made impression upon men of all tempers, humours, and inclina∣tions; <Q>“”And that no Ecclesiastical Person should become Surety, or Bound for any man; that National, or General Assemblies should be call'd only by the King's Authority; that all Bishops, and other Ec∣clesiastical Persons, who dy without Children, should be obliged to give a good part of their Estates to the Church, and, though they should have Children, yet to leave somewhat to the Church, and for advance∣ment of Learning;</Q> which seem'd rather to be matter of State, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Policy, than of Religion; thwarted their Laws and Customs, which had been observ'd by them; lessen'd, if not took away the Credit of Church-men; and prohibited them from that liberty of Commerce in Civil affairs, which the Laws permitted to them; and reflected upon the
<PB N="86" REF="1100"/>
interests of Those who had, or might have a right to Inherit from Cler∣gy-men. <Q>“”That none should receive the Sacrament but upon their Knees; that the Clergy should have no private meetings for expound∣ing Scripture, or for consulting upon Matters Ecclesiastical; that no man should cover his head in the time of Divine Service; and that no Clergy-man should conceive Prayers <HI>ex tempore,</HI> but be bound to pray only by the Form prescribed in the Liturgy (which by the way was not seen nor framed)</Q> <Q>“”and that no man should teach a publick School, or in a private House, without a Licence first obtain'd from the Arch-Bishop of the Province,</Q> or the Bishop of the Diocess. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>ALL these were new, and things with which they had not been ac∣quainted; and though they might be fit to be commended to a regular, and orderly People piously disposed, yet it was too strong meat for In∣fants in Discipline, and too much nourishment to be administred at Once to weak, and queasy Stomachs, and too much inclined to nauseate what was most wholesome. But then, to apply the old terms of the Church, to mention <Q>“”the <HI>Quatuor tempora,</HI> and restrain all Ordinations to those four Seasons of the Year; to enjoyn a Font to be prepared in every Church for Baptism, and a decent Table for the Communion; and to direct, and appoint the places where both Font and Table should stand, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and decent Ornaments for either; to restrain any Excommunication from being pronounced, or Absolution from being given, without the approbation of the Bishop;</Q> to mention any practice of Confession (which they look'd upon as the strongest, and most inseparable Limb of Antichrist) and to enjoyn <Q>“”that no Presbyter should reveal any thing he should receive in Confession, except in such cases, where, by the Law of the Land,</Q> his own Life should be Forfeited; were all such mat∣ters of Innovation, and in their nature so Suspicious, that they thought they had reason to be Jealous of the worst that could follow; and the last Canon of all provided <Q>“”that no person should be receiv'd into Holy Or∣ders, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> or suffer'd to Preach, or Administer the Sacraments without first Subscribing to those Canons.</Q></P>
<P>IT was now easy for Them, who had those Inclinations, to suggest to men of all conditions that here was an entire new Model of Govern∣ment in Church and State; the King might do what he would upon them all, and the Church was nothing but what the Bishops would have it be: which they every day infused into the minds of the People, with all the Artifices which administer Jealousies of all kinds to those, who are liable to be disquieted with them: yet they would not suffer (which shew'd wonderful power, and wonderful dexterity) any disorder to break <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> out upon all this occasion, but all was quiet, except spreading of Libels against the Bishops, and propagating that Spirit as much as they could, by their Correspondence in <HI>England;</HI> where they found too many every day transported by the same Infusions, in expectation that these Seeds of Jealousy from the Canons would grow apace, and produce such a Re∣ception for the Liturgy as they wish'd for.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Touching the <HI>Scotish</HI> Li∣turgy</NOTE> IT was about the month of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1637, that the Liturgy (after it had been sent out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and perused by the three Bishops in <HI>England,</HI> and then approved and confirm'd by the King) was Publish'd, and appointed to be Read in all the Churches. And in this particular <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> there was the same affected and premeditated Omission, as had been in the preparation and publication of the Canons; the Clergy not at all con∣sulted in it, and, which was more strange, not all the Bishops acquainted
<PB N="87" REF="1110"/>
with it; which was less censured afterwards, when some of them re∣nounced their Function, and became ordinary Presbyters, as soon as they saw the current of the time. The Privy-Council had no other notice of it, than all the Kingdom had, the Sunday before, when it was declared, "that the next Sunday the Liturgy should be Read; by which they were the less concern'd to foresee, or prevent any Obstructions which might happen.</P>
<P>THE Proclamation had appointed it to be read the <HI>Easter</HI> before, but the Earl of <HI>Traquaire</HI> High Treasurer of <HI>Scotland</HI> (who was the on∣ly <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Counsellor or Layman relyed upon by the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in that business) perswaded the King to defer it till <HI>July,</HI> that some good preparation might be made for the more chearful Reception of it. And as this pause gave the discontented Party more heart, and more time for their seditious Negotiations, so the ill Consequences of it, or the Actions which were subsequent to it, made Him suspected to be Privy to all the Conspiracy, and to be an Enemy to the Church; though in truth there neither appear'd then, nor in all the very unfortunate part of his life af∣terwards, any just ground for that accusation, and suspicion; but as he was exceedingly obliged to the Arch-Bishop, so he was a man of great <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Parts, and well affected to the Work in hand in his own judgement; and if he had been as much depended upon, to have advised the Bishops in the Prosecution, and for the Conduct of it, as he was to assist them in the carrying on whatsoever They proposed, it is very probable, that either so Much would not have been undertaken together, or that it would have Succeeded better; for he was without doubt not inferior to any of that Nation in Wisdom, and Dexterity. And though he was often pro∣voked, by the Insolence of some of the Bishops, to a Dislike of their over∣much Fervour, and too little Discretion, his Integrity to the King was without blemish, and his Affection to the Church so notorious, that he <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> never deserted it, till both It and He were over-run, and trod under foot; and they, who were the most notorious Persecutors of It, never left Per∣secuting Him to the death.</P>
<P>NOR was any thing done which he had proposed, for the better Ad∣justing things in the time of that Suspension, but every thing left in the same state of Unconcernedness as it was before; not so much as the Coun∣cil's being better Inform'd of it; as if they had been sure, that all men would have Submitted to it for Conscience sake.</P>
<P>ON the Sunday morning appointed for the work, the Chancellor of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner how that Li∣turgy was re∣ceiv'd at <HI>E∣denborough.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Scotland,</HI> and others of the Council, being present in the Cathedral <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Church, the Dean begun to read the Liturgy, which he had no sooner entred upon, but a noise and clamour was raised throughout the Church, that no words could be heard distinctly, and then a shower of Stones, and Sticks, and Cudgels were thrown at the Dean's head. The Bishop went up into the Pulpit, and from thence put them in mind of the Sa∣credness of the Place, of their Duty to God and the King; but he found no more Reverence, nor was the clamour and disorder less than before. The Chancellor, from his Seat, commanded the Provost and Magi∣strates of the City to descend from the Gallery in which they sate, and by their Authority to Suppress the Riot; which at last with great Diffi∣culty <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> they did, by driving the Rudest of those who made the disturbance out of the Church, and shutting the Doors; which gave the Dean oppor∣tunity to proceed in the reading of the Liturgy, that was not at all at∣tended or hearkned to by those who remain'd within the Church; and if
<PB N="88" REF="1120"/>
it had, they who were turn'd out continued their barbarous Noise, broke the Windows, and endeavour'd to break down the Doors; so that it was not possible for any to follow their Devotions.</P>
<P>WHEN all was done that at that time could be done there, and the Council and Magistrates went out of the Church to their Houses, the Rabble follow'd the Bishops with all the opprobrious language they could invent, of bringing in Superstition and Popery into the Kingdom, and making the people Slaves; and were not content to use their Tongues, but employ'd their Hands too in throwing Dirt and Stones at them; and treated the Bishop of <HI>Edenborough,</HI> whom they look'd upon as most <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="line"/> Active that way, so Rudely, that with difficulty he got into a House, after they had torn his Habit, and was from thence removed to his own, with great hazard of his Life. As this was the Reception it had in the Cathedral, so it fared not better in the other Churches of the City, but was entertain'd with the same Hollowing and Out-cries; and threatning the Men whose office it was to read it, with the same bitter Execrations against Bishops and Popery.</P>
<P>HITHERTO no person of Condition or Name appear'd, or seem'd to countenance this seditious Confusion; it was the Rabble, of which no∣body was named, and which is more strange, not one apprehended: and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> it seems the Bishops thought it not of Moment enough to desire, or re∣quire any Help, or Protection from the Council; but without confer∣ring with them, or applying themselves to them, they dispatch'd away an Express to the King, with a full and particular Information of all that had pass'd, and a desire that He would take that course he thought best for the carrying on his Service.</P>
<P>UNTIL this Advertisement arrived from <HI>Scotland,</HI> there were very few in <HI>England</HI> who had heard of any Disorders there, or of any thing done there which might produce any. The King himself had been all∣ways so jealous of the Priviledges of that his Native Kingdom (as hath <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> been touch▪d before) and that it might not be dishonour▪d by a suspicion of having any Dependence upon <HI>England,</HI> that he never suffer▪d any thing relating to That to be Debated, or so much as Communicated to his Privy-Council in This (though many of that Nation were, without distinction, Counsellors of <HI>England)</HI> but handled all those affairs Him∣self with two or three <HI>Scots</HI>-men, who allways attended in the Court for the business of that Kingdom, which was upon the matter still dispatch'd by the sole advice and direction of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton.</HI></P>
<P>AND the truth is, there was so little curiosity either in the Court, or the Country, to know any thing of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or what was done there, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that when the whole Nation was sollicitous to know what pass'd weekly in <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> and all other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> no man ever en∣quired what was doing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor had that Kingdom a place or mention in one Page of any Gazette; and even after the Advertisement of this preamble to Rebellion, no mention was made of it at the Coun∣cil-Board, but such a Dispatch made into <HI>Scotland</HI> upon it, as express'd the King's dislike and displeasure, and obliged the Lords of the Council there to appear more vigorously in the Vindication of his Authority, and Suppression of those Tumults. But all was too little. That People, after they had once begun, pursued the business vigorously, and with all ima∣ginable <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Contempt of the Government; and though in the Hubbub of the first day there appear'd nobody of name or reckoning, but the Actors were really of the Dregs of the people, yet they discover'd by the coun∣tenance
<PB N="89" REF="1130"/>
of that day, that few men of Rank were forward to engage themselves in the quarrel on the behalf of the Bishops; whereupon more considerable Persons every day appear'd against them, and (as heretofore in the case of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 13. 50. <HI>the Jews stir'd up the devout and honourable Women</HI> the Women and Ladies of the best Quality declared themselves of the Party, and, with all the reproaches imaginable, made war upon the Bishops, as introducers of Popery and Superstition, against which they avowed themselves to be irreconcilable Enemies; and their Husbands did not long defer the owning the same Spirit; insomuch as <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> within few days the Bishops durst not appear in the Streets, nor in any Courts, or Houses, but were in danger of their Lives; and such of the Lords as durst be in their company, or seem'd to desire to rescue them from violence, had their Coaches torn in pieces, and their Persons as∣saulted▪ insomuch as they were glad to send for some of those great Men, who did indeed govern the Rabble, though they appear'd not in it, who readily came and redeem'd them out of their hands: so that by the time new Orders came from <HI>England,</HI> there was scarce a Bishop left in <HI>Eden∣borough,</HI> and not a Minister who durst read the Liturgy in any Church.</P>
<P>ALL the Kingdom flock'd to <HI>Edenborough,</HI> as in a general cause that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> concern'd their Salvation, and resolv'd themselves into a Method of Go∣vernment, erected several Tables, in which Deputies sate for the Nobi∣lity, the Gentlemen, the Clergy, and the Burgesses; out of either of which Tables a Council was elected to conduct their affairs, and a Peti∣tion drawn up in the names of the Nobility, Lairds, Clergy, and Bur∣gesses, to the King, complaining of the introduction of Popery, and many other Grievances. And if the Lords of the Council issued out any Order against them, or if the King himself sent a Proclamation for their repair to their Houses, and for the preservation of the Peace, presently some Nobleman deputed by the Tables published a Protestation against <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> those Orders and Proclamations, with the same confidence, and with as much formality, as if the Government were regularly in Their hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scotish</HI> Covenant.</NOTE> THEY call'd a General Assembly, whéther they summon'd the Bishops to appear before them, and for not appearing, Excommunicated them; and then they united themselves by Subscribing a Covenant, which they pretended with their usual confidence to be no other, than had been Sub∣scribed in the Reign of King <HI>James,</HI> and that his Majesty himself had Subscribed it; by which Imposition people of all degrees, supposing it might be a means to Extinguish the present Fire, with all alacrity en∣gaged themselves in it; whereas intruth, they had inserted a Clause ne∣ver <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> heard of, and quite contrary to the End of that Covenant, whereby they obliged themselves to pursue the Extirpation of Bishops, and had the confidence to demand the same in express terms of the King in an∣swer to a very gracious Message the King had sent to them. They pub∣lish'd bitter Invectives against the Bishops, and the whole Government of the Church, which they were not contented to send into <HI>England</HI> to kindle the same Fire there, but, with their Letters, sent them to all the Reform'd Churches, by which they raised so great a Prejudice to the King, that too many of them believ'd, that the King had a real de∣sign to change Religion, and introduce Popery.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> IT is very true, there were very many of the Nobility, and Persons of principal Quality of that Nation, and in <HI>Edengborouh</HI> at that time, who did not appear yet, and concur in this Seditious behaviour, or own their being yet of their Party; but on the contrary seem'd very much
<PB N="90" REF="1140"/>
to dislike their proceedings: but it is as true, that very few had the cou∣rage to do any thing in Opposition to them; or to concur in the Prose∣cution of any Regal Act against them; which did in some respects more advance their Designs, than if they had manifestly joyin'd with them. For these Men, many of whom were of the Council, by all their Let∣ters into <HI>England,</HI> exceedingly undervalued the Disorder, as being <Q>“”very easy to be Suppress'd in a short time, when the Peoples eyes should be open'd; and that the removing the Courts to some other place, and a gracious condescension in the King in offering Pardon for what was past, would suddainly Subdue them, and every body would return <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to his Duty:</Q> and the City of <HI>Edenborough</HI> it self writ an humble Letter to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> excusing the Disorders which had been raised by the Ignorance and Rudeness of the meanest of the People, and beseeching him "to intercede with his Majesty for the su∣spension of his Prejudice to them, till they should manifest their duty <Q>“”to him, by inslicting exemplary Punishment upon the chief Offenders, and causing the Liturgy to be receiv'd and submitted to in all their Churches;</Q> which they profess'd they would in a short time bring to pass. So that by this means, and the Interposition of all those of that Nation who attended upon his Majesty in his Bed-Chamber, and in seve∣ral <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Offices at Court, who all undertook to know by their Intelligences that all was Quiet, or would speedily be so; his Majesty (who well knew that they who appear'd most active in this Confederacy were much infe∣rior to Those who did not appear, and who profess'd great Zeal for his Service) hardly prevail'd with himself to believe that he could receive any Disturbance from thence, till he found all his Condescensions had raised their Insolence, all his Offers rejected, and his Proclamation of Pardon slighted and contemn'd; and that they were Listing men towards the raising an Army, under the obligation of their Covenant, and had allready chosen Colonel <HI>Lesly,</HI> a Soldier of that Nation of long Expe∣rience <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and eminent Command under the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> to be their General; who being lately Disobliged (as they call'd it) by the King, that is, denied somewhat he had a mind to have, had accepted of the Command. Then at last the King thought it time to resort to other Counsels, and to provide Force to Chastise them, who had so much despised all his gentler Remedies.</P>
<P>HE could now no longer defer the acquinting the Council-Board, and the whole Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> with the Indignities he had su∣stain'd in <HI>Scotland;</HI> which he did by Proclamations and Declararations at large, setting out the whole Proceedings which had been; and in the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> end of the Year 1638 declared his Resolution to raise an Army to Sup∣press their Rebellion, for which he gave present order.</P>
<P>AND this was the first Alarm <HI>England</HI> receiv'd towards any Trouble, after it had enjoy'd for so many Years the most uninterrupted Prosperity, in a full and plentiful Peace, that any Nation could be bless'd with: and as there was no apprehension of troubles from Within, so it was secured from Without, by a stronger Fleet at Sea then the Nation had ever been acquainted with, which drew reverence from all the neighbour Princes. The Revenue had been so well improved, and so warily managed, that there was Mony in the Exchequer proportionable for the undertaking <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> any noble Enterprize: nor did this first noise of War, and approach to∣wards Action, seem to make any impression upon the Minds of men, the <HI>Scots</HI> being in no degree either Lov'd or Fear'd by the People; and most
<PB N="91" REF="1150"/>
men hoped, that this would free the Court from being henceforth trou∣bled with Those men; and so they seem'd to embrace the Occasion with notable alacrity: and there is no doubt, but if all of that Nation who were united in the Rebellion (some of which staid yet in the Court) had march'd in their Army, and publickly Own'd the Covenant, which in their Hearts they adored, neither the King, nor the Kingdom, could have sustain'd any great Damage by them; but the monument of their Presumption and their Shame would have been raised together, and no other memory preserv'd of their Rebellion but in their memorable <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Overthrow.</P>
<P>GOD Allmighty would not suffer this discerning Spirit of Wisdom to govern at this time: the King thought it unjust to condemn a Nation for the transgression of a part of it, and still hoped to redeem if from the infamy of a General Defection by the exemplary Fidelity of a Superior Party, and therefore withdrew not his Confidence from any of Those who attended his Person, who, intruth, lay leiger for the Covenant, and kept up the spirits of their Country-men by Their intelligence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King raises an Ar∣my against the <HI>Scots:</HI></NOTE> THE King hastened the raising an Army, which was not long in do∣ing. He chose to make the Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> his General, a man who was <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> thought to be made choice of for his Negative Qualities: He did Not love the <HI>Scots;</HI> he did Not love the Puritans; which Qualifications were al∣lay'd by another Negative, he did Not much love Any body else: but he was fit to keep the State of it; and his Rank was such, that no man would decline the Serving under him.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was made Lievtenent-General of the Army, the most Popular man of the Kingdom, and the Darling of the Sword-men; who, between a hatred and a contempt of the <HI>Scots,</HI> had nothing like an affection for any man of that Nation; and therefore was so well pleased with his Promotion, that he begun to love the King the better for con∣ferring <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> it upon him, and entred upon the province with great Fidelity and Alacrity, and was capable from that hour of any Impression the King would have fix'd upon him.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was General of the Horse; who, besides the Obli∣gations he had to the Queen (who vouchsased to own a particular trust in him) was not then liable to the least Suspicion of want of affection, and zeal for the King's Service.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the Spring, which was in the Year 1639, an Ar∣my was drawn together of near six thousand Horse, and about that num∣ber in Foot, all very well disciplined Men, under as good and experienced <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Officers, as were to be found at that time in <HI>Christendom.</HI> With this Army abundantly supplied with a Train of Artillery, and all other Pro∣visions necessary, the King advanced in the beginning of the Summer towards the Borders of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and a Fleet.</NOTE> THIS was not all the Strength that was provided for the Suppressing that Rebellion, but the King had likewise provided a good Fleet, and had caused a body of three thousand Foot to be embark'd on those Ships, all which were put under the Command of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who was to infest the Country by Sea to hinder their Trade, and to make a descent upon the Land, and join with such Forces as the Loyal Party <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of that Nation should draw together to assist the King's, which his Own interest (as was believ'd) would give great life to, his Family be∣ing numerous in the Nobility, and united in an entire Dependence upon him.</P>

The Earl lost no time, but march'd day and night with great order and diligence; and every day met several <HI>Scots</HI>-men of Quality well known to him, and sent Expressly to the King, who all severally made him very particular relations of the Strength of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, the excellent Discipline that was observ'd in it, and the goodness of the Men, and that they were by that time pos∣sess'd of <HI>Berwick;</HI> and when he was within one days March of it, a Per∣son <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of principal Condition, of very near relation to the King's Service, (who pretended to be sent upon matter of high Importance to his Maje∣sty from Those who most intended his Service there) met him, and ad∣vised him very earnestly "not to advance farther with his Party, which, he said, <Q>“”was so much Inferior in number to those of the Enemy, that it would infallibly be cut off: that himself overtook the day before a strong Party of the Army, consisting of three thousand Horse and Foot with a Train of Artillery,</Q> all which he left at such a Place (which he named) <Q>“”within three hours March of <HI>Berwick,</HI> where they resolv'd to be the Night before, so that his proceeding farther must be Fruitless, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and expose him to inevitable Ruin.</Q> These Advertisements wrought no otherwise upon the Earl, than to hasten his Marches, insomuch that he came to <HI>Berwick</HI> sooner than he proposed to have done, entred the Place without the least Opposition, and by all the Enquiry he could make by sending out Parties, and other Advertisements, he could not discover that any of the Enemies Forces had been drawn that way, nor indeed that they had any considerable Forces together nearer than <HI>Eden∣borough.</HI></P>
<P>THE Earl being thus possess'd of his Post, lost no time in advertising the King of it, and sent him a very particular account of the Informa∣tions <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> he had receiv'd from so many Ear and Eye witnesses, who were all at that time in the Court, and very fit to be Suspected after the pub∣lishing of so many Falshoods; and these very Men had been constant in the same Reports, and as confident in reporting the Defeat of the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> and cutting off his Party, as they had been to Himself of the <HI>Scots</HI> March, and their being Masters of <HI>Berwick.</HI> The Joy was not conceal'd with which his Majesty receiv'd the News of the Earl's being in <HI>Ber∣wick,</HI> the Contrary whereof those men made him apprehend with much Perplexity; but they underwent no other reproach for their Intelligence, than that their Fears had multiplied their Sight, and that they had been <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Frighted with other mens Relations; which Remissness, to call it no worse, was an ill Omen of the Discipline that was like to be observ'd.</P>
<P>IF the War had been now vigorously pursued, it had been as soon ended as begun, for at this time they had not drawn three thousand men together in the whole Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor had intruth Arms com∣pleat for such a number, though They had the possession of all the King's Forts and Magazines there, nor had they Ammunition to supply their few Fire-Arms; Horses they had, and Officers they had, which made all their Shew. But it was the fatal Misfortune of the King, which pro∣ceeded from the Excellency of his Nature, and his Tenderness of Blood, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that he Defer'd so long his resolution of Using his Arms; and after he had taken that resolution, that it was not Prosecuted with more Vigour.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="1170"/>
HE more intended the Pomp of his Preparations than the Strength of them, and did still believe that the one would save the labour of the other. At the same time that he resolv'd to raise an Army, he caused en∣quiry to be made, what Obligations lay upon his Subjects to assist him, both as he went himself in Person, and as it was an Expedition against the <HI>Scots;</HI> which, in the ancient Enmity between the two Nations, had been provided for by some Laws; and in the Tenure which many men held their Estates by, he found that the Kings had usually when they went to make War in their own Persons, call'd as many of the Nobility <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to attend upon them, as they thought fit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King sum∣mons the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Nobility to attend kim</NOTE> THEREUPON he Summon'd most of the Nobility of the Kingdom, without any consideration of their Affections how they stood disposed to that Service, to Attend upon him by a day appointed, and throughout that Expedition; presuming that the glory of such a visible appearance of the whole Nobility would look like such an Union in the Quarrel, as wonld at once Terrify and Reduce the <HI>Scots;</HI> not considering that such kinds of Uniting do often produce the greatest Confusions, when more and greater Men are call'd together than can be united in Affections and Interests; and in the necessary Differences which arise from thence, they <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> quickly come to know each other so well, as they rather Break into se∣veral Divisions, than Join in any one Publick interest; and from hence have allways risen the most dangerous Factions, which have threatned and ruin'd the Peace of Nations: and it fell out no better here. If there had been none in the March but Soldiers, it is most probable that a noble Peace would have quickly ensued, even without Fighting; but the Pro∣gress was more illustrious than the March, and the Soldiers were the least part of the Army, and least consulted with.</P>
<P>IN this Pomp the King continued his journey to <HI>York,</HI> where he had a full Court, those Noblemen of the Northern Parts, and many others <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> who overtook not the King till then, joining all in that City; where his Majesty found it necessary to stay some days; and there the Fruit, that was to be gather'd from such a Conflux, quickly Budded out. Some Rules were to be set down for the Government of the Army; the Court was too Numerous to be wholely left to its own Licence; and the mul∣titude of the <HI>Scots</HI> in it, administred matter of Offence and Jealously to People of all conditions, who had too much cause to fear that the King was every day Betray▪d; the common Discourse by all the <HI>Scots</HI> being either to magnify the Good Intentions of their Country-men, and that they had all Duty for the King, or to undervalue the Power and interest <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of Those who discover'd themselves against the Church</P>
<P>IT was therefore thought fit by the whole body of the Council, that a short Protestation should be drawn, in which all men should <Q>“”profess their Loyalty and Obedience to his Majesty, and disclaim and renounce the having any Intelligence, or holding any Correspondence with the Rebels.</Q> No man imagin'd it possible that any of the <HI>English</HI> would re∣fuse to make that Protestation; and they who thought worrst of the <HI>Scots,</HI> did not think they would make any Scruple of doing the same, and con∣sequently that there would be no Fruit, or Discovery from that Test; but they were deceiv'd: the <HI>Scots</HI> indeed took it to a man, without grieving <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> their Conscience, or reforming their Manners. But amongst the <HI>English</HI> Nobility the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Brook</HI> (two Popular men, and most Undevoted to the Church, and, intruth, to the whole Govern∣ment) positively refused in the King's own Presence to make any such
<PB N="94" REF="1180"/>
Protestation. They said, <Q>“”If the King suspected their Loyalty he might proceed against them as he thought fit, but that it was Against the Law to impose any Oaths or Protestations upon them which were not En∣joyn'd by the Law; and, in that respect, that they might not Betray the common Liberty,</Q> they would not Submit to it. This administred matter of new Dispute in a very unseasonable time; and though there did not then appear More of the same mind, and they two were Com∣mitted, at least Restrain'd of their liberty, yet this discovered too much the Humour and Spirit of the Court in their dayly discourses upon that Subject; so that the King thought it best to dismiss those two Lords, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and require them to return to their Houses: and if all the rest who were∣not Officers of the Army, or of absolute Necessity about the King's per∣son, had been likewise Dismiss'd and sent home, the Business had been better Prosecuted.</P>

<P>THE Horse had out-march'd the Foot, which, by reason of the ex∣cessive Heat, was not able to use great expedition: besides there was some error in the Orders, and some accidents of the Night that had retarded them; so that when the Enemy appear'd first in view, the Foot and the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Artillery was three or four Miles behind.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl's Retreat from <HI>Dunce.</HI></NOTE> NOTHING can be said in the Excuse of the Counsel of that day, which Might have made the King a glorious King indeed. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was a man of Courage, and at that time not at all suspected to be Cor∣rupted in his Affections; and though he himself had not seen more of War then two or three Campaigns in <HI>Holland</HI> before his coming to the Court, he had with him many as good Officers as the War of that age, which was very active, had made, and men of unquestionable Courage and Military knowledge. As he might very safely have made a Halt at <HI>Dunce</HI> till his Foot and Artillery came up to him, so he might securely <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> enough have engaged his Body of Horse against their Whole inconsidera∣ble Army, there being neither Tree nor Bush to interrupt his Charge; but it was thought otherwise; and no question it was generally believ'd, by the placing and drawing out their Front in so conspicuous a place, by the appearance of other Troops behind them, and by the shewing great herds of Cattle at a distance upon the Hills on either side, that Their Army was very much Superior in number. And therefore as soon as the Earl came in view, he dispatch'd Messengers one after another to the King, with an account of what he heard and saw, or believ'd he saw; and yet thought not fit to stay for an Answer; but with the joint Con∣sent <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of all his chief Officers (for it was never after pretended that any one Officer of name Disswaded it, though they were still Ashamed of it) Retired towards his Foot, to whom he had likewise sent Orders not to Advance; and so Wearied and Tired by the length of the March, and more by the heat of the Weather, which was intolerable, they return'd to the Camp, where the King was; and the <HI>Scots</HI> drew a little back, to a more convenient Post for their residence.</P>
<P>THE Covenanters, who very well understood the Weaknesses of the Court, as well as their own Want of Strength, were very reasonably exalted with this Success, and scatter'd their Letters abroad amongst the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Noblemen at Court, according to the Humours of the men to whom they writ; there being upon the matter an unrestrain'd Intercourse be∣tween the King's Camp and <HI>Edenborough.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenan∣ters write to the three Ge∣neral Officers.</NOTE> THEY writ three several Letters to the three Generals, the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Holland.</HI> That to the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was in a dialect more Submiss than to the others; they said much to him of <Q>“”his own Fame and Reputation, which added to their Affli∣ction that He should be in Arms against them; That they had not the least imagination of entring into a War against <HI>England,</HI> their only thought and hope was to Defend their own Rights and Liberties, which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> were due to them by the Law of the Land, untill they might have Ac∣cess to his Majesty to expose their Complaints to him, from which they were hindred by the Power and Greatness of some of their own Coun∣try-men;</Q> being desirous the Earl should understand that their prin∣cipal
<PB N="96" REF="1200"/>
Grievance was the Interest of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who, they knew, was not in any degree acceptable to the Earl; and therefore de∣sired him <Q>“”to be ready to do them good offices to the King, that they might be admitted to his presence.</Q> The Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who was a pun∣ctual man in point of Honour, receiv'd this Address superciliously e∣nough, sent it to the King without returning any Answer, or holding any Conference, or performing the least Ceremony, with or towards the Messengers.</P>
<P>THE Earls of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> gave another kind of Reception to the Letters they receiv'd. To the former, after many professions of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> high Esteem of his Person, they enlarged upon <Q>“”their great Affection to the <HI>English</HI> Nation, and how they abhor'd the thought of a War be∣tween the two Nations; they besought him "to present their Suppli∣cation (which they inclosed, to the King, and to procure their Depu∣ties admission to his Majesty.</Q> The Earl used them with more Respect than was suitable to the office of a General, and made many professions of <Q>“”his desire to Interpose, and Mediate a good Peace between the Na∣tions:</Q> and it was confidently reported, and believ'd, that he had fre∣quently made those Professions by several Messages he had sent before into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and he had given Passes to many obscure Persons, to go <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> into and return out of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>THEIR Letter to the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was in a more Consident style, as to a man from whom they Expected all good offices. They sent him likewise a Copy of their Supplication to the King, and desired him <Q>“”to use his credit that a Treaty might be entred into, and that his Majesty would appoint men of Religion and of publick Hearts to manage the Treaty.</Q> From this time that Earl was found at least enough inclined to that interest; and the King's readiness to hear discourses of a Pacifi∣cation, and that Messengers would be shortly sent to him with Proposi∣tions worthy of his Acceptation, abated those Animosities, and appetite <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to war, which had made all the noise in the March.</P>
<P>INDEED the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Neighbourly residence with his Fleet and Foot Soldiers before <HI>Leith,</HI> without any shew of Hostility, or any care taken to draw his Friends and Followers together for the King's Service; on the other side, the Visits his Mother made him on board his Ship, who was a Lady of great Authority amongst the Covenanters, and most addicted to Them and their Covenant, her Daughters being like∣wise married to those Noblemen, who most furiously Persecuted the Church, and Presided in those Councils; the King's refusing to give leave to some Officers of Horse, who had offer'd to make Inroads into the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Country, and destroy the stock thereof, whereby they would be pre∣sently obliged to make Submission, and to ask Pardon; and lastly the re∣ception of the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> after his shameful Retreat, with so much Satisfaction and Joy as his Majesty had manifested upon his return (have¦ing after the first Messengers arrival from <HI>Dunce,</HI> when the Enemy was in view, sent him Orders not to Engage) made it then suspected, as it was afterwards believ'd by Those who stood nearest, that his Maje∣sty had intruth never any purpose to make the War in blood, but believ'd that by Shewing an Army to them which was able to Force them to any Conditions, they would have beg'd Pardon for the Contest they had <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> made, and so he should have Settled the Church, and all things else ac∣cording to his Pleasure: and sure he might have done so, if he had but State still, and been Constant to his own Interest, and positive in Denying
<PB N="97" REF="1210"/>
their insolent Demands. But the <HI>Scots</HI> in the Court had made Impression upon so many of the <HI>English</HI> Lords, that though at that time there were very few of them who had entred into an unlawful Combination against the King, yet there was allmost a general Dislike of the War, both by the Lords of the Court and of the Country; and they took this Oppor∣tunity to communicate their Murmurs to each other; none of the Per∣sons who were most maligned for their Power and Interest with the King being upon the place; and all men believing, that nothing could be ask▪d of the King but what must be satisfied at their charge, whose damage <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> they consider'd though it was to be procured at the expence of the King's honour. When the Covenanters understood by their Intelligence, that the Season was ripe, they sent their Supplication (of which they had scatter'd so many Copies) to the King, and found themselves so Welcome to all persons, that their modesty was not like to suffer any violence in offering the conditions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They Address to the King.</NOTE> THE <HI>Scots</HI> had, from the beginning, practiced a new sturdy style of Address, in which, under the Licence of accusing the counsel and carriage of Others, whom yet they never named, they bitterly and insolently Re∣proach'd the most immediate actions and directions of his Majesty him∣self; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and then made the greatest professions of Duty to his Majesty's per∣son that could be invented. The King had not, at that time, one Person about him of his Council who had the least consideration of his own Ho∣nour, or Friendship for those who sat at the Helm of affairs; the Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> only excepted: who was a Young man of small experience in affairs, though a man of great Honour, and very good Parts, and under the disadvantage of being look'd upon as a <HI>Scots</HI>-man; which he was not in his Affections at all, being born in <HI>England</HI> of an <HI>English</HI> Mother, and having had his Education there; and had indeed the manners and affe∣ctions of an <HI>English</HI>-man, and a duty and reverence for the King and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Church accordingly; and would never trust himself in those In∣trigues, as too mysterious for him.</P>
<P>THE rest who were about the King in any offices of attendance, were the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> whom we have had occasion to mention before in the first entrance upon this Discourse, and whom we shall have often oc∣casion hereafter to speak of; and therefore shall say no more of him now, than that he neither Lov'd the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> whom he believ'd the <HI>Scots</HI> intended to Revenge themselves upon; nor <HI>Wentworth</HI> the De∣puty of <HI>Ireland;</HI> nor the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> nor allmost any thing that was then done in Church or State. Secretary <HI>Coke,</HI> who had <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> all the Dispatches upon his hand, was near Eighty years of age; a man of gravity, who never had quickness from his Cradle; who lov'd the Church well enough as it was twenty years before; and understood no∣thing that had been done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and thought that nothing that was or could be done there, was worth such a Journey as the King had put himself to. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane</HI> was Comptroller of the House, and a busy and a bustling man; who had credit enough to do his business in all pla∣ces, and cared for no man otherwise than as he found it very conve∣nient for himself. There was no other of his Council of name but the General the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> who was allways true to the Character un∣der <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> which he has been deliver'd, and thought he had been General long enough. All the Lustre of the Court was in that part of the Nobility which attended upon Command, and at their Own charge; and therefore the more Weary of it. The Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> hath been forgotten, who
<PB N="98" REF="1220"/>
abhor'd the War as obstinately as he lov'd Hunting and Hawking, and so was like to promote all overtures towards Accommodation with great importunity: so the <HI>Scots</HI> found Persons to treat with according to their Own wish. The Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> still preserving his Grandeur and Punctual∣lity, positively Refused to meddle in the Treaty, or to be Communicated with, or so much as to be Present, or receive any Visits from the <HI>Scot∣tish</HI> Commissioners till after the Pacification was concluded.</P>
<P>THE Covenanters were firm, and adhered still to their old natural Principle, even in this their Address; <Q>justified all they had done to be “”according to Their native Rights, and for the better advancement of his <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Majesty▪s Service,</Q> which they had allwayes before their eyes; and de∣sired <Q>“”to have those receive exemplary punishment, who had done them ill offices and misrepresented their carrage to the King; and that some noble Lords might be appointed to treat upon all Particulars.</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> entred <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> And upon no other Submission than this, a Treaty was presently entred upon▪ and concluded.</P>
<P>WHOSOEVER will take upon him to relate all that pass'd in that Treaty, must be beholding to his own Invention: the most material matters having pass'd in Discourse, and very little commited to Writing. Nor did any Two who were present agree in the same Relations of what <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> was said, and done; and which was worse, not in the same Interpreta∣tion of the Meaning of what was comprehended in Writing. An Agree∣ment was made, if that can be call'd an Agreement in which nobody meant what others believ'd he did: <Q>“”The Armies were to be disbanded; an Act of Oblivion pass'd; the King▪s Forts and Castles to be restored; and an Assembly and Parliament to be call'd for a full Settlement; no persons reserv'd for Justice,</Q> because no Fault had been committed. The King's Army, by the very Words of the Agreement, was not to be dis∣banded untill all should be executed on Their part; and the King him∣self, at that time, resolv▪d to be present in the Assembly at least, if not <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> in the Parliament: but the Impatience of all was such for Peace, that the King's Army was presently Disbanded; his Majesty making all pos∣sible hast himself to <HI>London,</HI> and sending the Earl of <HI>Traquaire</HI> to <HI>Eden∣borough</HI> to prepare all things for the Assembly; whilst the <HI>Scots</HI> made all the Caresses to many of the <HI>English,</HI> and Both breath'd out in mutual con∣fidence their Resentments to each other.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>Hamilton</HI> (whether upon the fame of the Treaty, or sent for by the King, few knew) left his Fleet before <HI>Leith</HI> in a very peaceable posture, and came to <HI>the Berkes</HI> some hours after the Treaty was Sign'd; which was very convenient to Him, for thereby he was free <MILESTONE N="4$" UNIT="line"/> from the Reproach that attended it, and at liberty to find Fault with it; which he did freely to the King, and to some Others, whereby he preserv'd himself in credit to do more Mischief. Many were then of opinion, and still are, that the Marquis at that time was very Unac∣ceptable to his Country-men; and it is certain that the chief Managers at the Treaty did perswade the <HI>English</HI> in whom they most confided, that their principal aim was to remove Him from the Court; which was a design willingly heard, and universally grateful. But whatever state of grace he stood in when he came thither, he did himself so good offices before he parted, that he was no more in Their disfavour. The King's <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Army was presently Disbanded, and the <HI>Scots</HI> return'd to <HI>Edenborough</HI> with all they desired; having gotten many more Friends in <HI>England</HI> than they had before; kept all their Officers, and as many of their Men,
<PB N="99" REF="1230"/>
as they thought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it in Pay; and Prosecuted all those who had not shew'd the same Zeal in their Covenant as themselves with great rigour, as men whose Affections they doubted; and instead of Remitting any thing of their rage against their Bishops, they entred a publick Protestation, <Q>“”that they did not intend, by any thing contain'd in the Treaty, to Vacate any of the Proceedings which had been in the late General Assembly at <HI>Glasgow</HI> (by which all the Bishops stood Excommunicated) and re∣newed all their Menaces against them by Proclamation;</Q> and imposed grievous Penalties upon all who should presume to harbour any of them <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> in their Houses: so that, by the time the King came to <HI>London,</HI> it appear'd plainly, that the Army was disbanded without any Peace made, and the <HI>Scots</HI> in equal Inclinations, and in more Reputation, to Affront his Ma∣jesty than ever. Upon which a Paper publish'd by Them, and avow'd to contain the matter of the Treaty, was Burn'd by the Common Hang∣man; every body disavowing the Contents of it, but nobody taking upon him to publish a Copy that they own'd to be True.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ill Conse∣quences of it.</NOTE> THE Mischief that befell the King from this wonderful Atonement cannot be express'd, nor was it ever discover'd what prevail'd over his Majesty to bring it so Wofully to pass: all men were Ashamed who had <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> contributed to it; nor had he dismiss'd his Army with so obliging cir∣cumstances as was like to incline them to come willingly together again, if there were occasion to use their service. The Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who had merited very well throughout the whole Affair, and had never made a false step in Action or Counsel, was discharged in the Croud, without or∣dinary Ceremony; and an accident happening at the same time, or very soon after, by the death of the Lord <HI>Aston,</HI> whereby the Command of the Forrest of <HI>Needwood</HI> fell into the King's disposal, which lay at the very door of that Earl's Estate, and would infinitely have gratified him, was denied to Him, and bestow'd upon Another: all which wrought very <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> much upon his high Nature, and made him susceptible of some Im∣pressions afterwards, which otherwise would not have found such casy admission.</P>
<P>THE Factions and Animosities at Court were either greater, or more visible, than they had been before. The Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> (who was Governour to the Prince, and one of the most Valuable men in the King∣dom, in his Fortune, in his Dependences, and in his Qualifications) had, at his Own charge, drawn together a goodly Troop of Horse of two hun∣dred; which for the most part consisted of the best Gentlemen of the North, who were either Allied to the Earl, or of immediate Dependence <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> upon him, and came together purely upon His account; and call'd this Troop <HI>the Prince of</HI> Wales<HI>'s Troop;</HI> whereof the Earl himself was Captain. When the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> march'd with that Party into <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> accompanied him with that Troop, and upon occasion of some Orders, desired that Troop, since it belong'd to the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> might have some Precedence; which the General of the Horse refused to grant him, but required him to march in the rank he had prescribed; and the other obey'd it accordingly, but with resent∣ment; imputing it to the little kindness that was between them. But as soon as the Army was Disbanded, he sent a Challenge to the Earl of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Holland,</HI> by a Gentleman very punctual, and well acquainted with those Errands; who took a proper season to mention it to him, without a pos∣sibility of suspicion. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was never suspected to want Courage, yet in This occasion he shew'd not that alacrity, but that the
<PB N="100" REF="1240"/>
delay exposed it to notice; and so, by the King's Authority, the matter was Composed; though discoursed of with liberty enough to give the whole Court occasion to express their Affections to either Party.</P>
<P>THE King himself was very Melancholick, and quickly discern'd that he had lost Reputation at home and abroad; and those Counsellors who had been most Faulty, either through want of Courage or Wisdom (for at that time few of them wanted Fidelity) never afterwards re∣cover'd Spirit enough to do their Duty, but gave themselves up to Those who had so much Over-witted them; every man shifting the Fault from himself, and finding some Friend to excuse him: and it being yet neces∣sary, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> that so Infamous a matter should not be cover'd with absolute Oblivion, it fell to Secretary <HI>Coke's</HI> turn (for whom nobody cared) who was then near fourscore years of age, to be made the Sacrifice; and, upon pretence that he had Omitted the writing what he ought to have done, and Inserted somewhat he ought Not to have done, he was put out of his Office; and within ashort time after, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane</HI> (who was Treasurer of the House) by the dark Contrivance of the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and by the open and visible Power of the Queen, made Secretary of State; which was the only thing that could make the Removal of the other old man Censured and Murmur'd at: and this was attended again with a de∣clared <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and unseasonable Dislike and Displeasure in the Queen against the Lievtenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> newly made Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> who out of some kindness to the old man, who had been much trusted by him and of use to him, and out of contempt and detestation of <HI>Vane,</HI> but principally out of a desire to have that Miscarriage exp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated by a greater Sacrifice, opposed the Removal of Secretary <HI>Coke</HI> with all the interest he could, got it Suspended for some time, and put the Queen to the exercise of her full power to Perfect her work; which afterwards produced many sad Disasters. So that this unhappy Pacification kindled many Fires of Contention in Court and Country, though the Flame broke out first <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> again in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>ON the other side, the <HI>Scots</HI> got so much Benefit and Advantage by it, that they brought all their other mischievous Devices to pass, with ease, and a prosperous Gale in all they wentabout. They had before little Cre∣dit abroad in any Forreign parts, and so could procure neither Arms nor Ammunition; and though they could lead the People at Home, out of the hatred and jealousy of Popery, into unruly Tumults, yet they had not Authority▪ enough over them to engage them in a firm resolution of Rebellion: the Opinion of their unquestionable Duty and Loyalty to the King, was that which had given them reputation to Affront him: nor <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> durst they yet attempt to lay any Tax or Imposition upon the People, or to put them to any Charge. But, after this Pacification, they appear'd much more Considerable abroad and at home; Abroad, where they were not so much consider'd before, now that they had brought an Army into the Field against the King, and gain'd all they pretended to desire without reproach or blemish, <HI>France,</HI> their old Ally, look'd upon them as good Instruments to disturb their Neighbours; and Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> (who had never look'd upon the Defeat and Overthrow at the Isle of <HI>Ree,</HI> as any reparation for the Attempt and Dishonour of the Invasion) was very glad of the opportunity of Disturbing a Rest and Quiet, which had not <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> been favourable to His designs; and sent an Agent privately to <HI>Eden∣borough,</HI> to cherish and foment their Unpeaceable Inclinations; and re∣ceiv'd Another from thence, who sollicited Supplies, and communicated
<PB N="101" REF="1250"/>
Counsels: he sent them Arms and Ammunition, and promised them Encouragement and Assistance proportionable to any Enterprize they should frankly engage themselves in. <HI>Holland</HI> entred into a closer cor∣respondence with them; and they found Credit there for a great stock of Arms and Ammunition, upon Security of payment within a Year; which Security they easily found a way to give. And thus Countenanced, and Supplied, they quickly got Credit and Power over the people at Home; and as soon as they had form'd some Troops of those who had been listed by them under good Officers (whereof store resorted to them of that Na∣tion <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> out of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Sweden)</HI> and assign'd Pay to them, they made no longer scruple to Impose what Money they thought fit upon the Peo∣ple, and to levy it with all Rigour upon them who refused, or express'd any unwillingness to submit to the Imposition; and made the residence of any amongst them very uneasy, and very insecure, who were but suspected by them not to wish well to their Proceedings: and so they renew'd all those Forms for the Administration of the Government, which they had begun in the beginning of the Disorders, and which they disclaim'd upon making the Pacification; and refused to suffer the King's Governour of the Castle of <HI>Edenborough</HI> (which was put into his hands <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> about the same time) either to repair some Works which were newly fall'n down, or so much as to buy Provision in the Town for the food of the Garrison.</P>
<P>BUT that which was the greatest Benefit and Advantage that accrew'd to them from the Agreement, and which was worth all the rest, was the conversation they had with the <HI>English</HI> with so much Reputation, that they had perswaded very many to believe, that they had all manner of Fidelity to the King, and had too much cause to complain of the hard Proceedings against them by the Power of some of their own Country∣men; and the Acquaintance they made with some particular Lords, to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that degree, that They did upon the matter agree what was to be done for the future, and how to obstruct any Opposition or Proceedings by those who were look'd upon as Enemies by both Sides: for none in <HI>Scot∣land</HI> more Disliked all that was done in Court, and the chief Actors there, than Those Lords of <HI>England</HI> did; though They were not so well pre∣pared for an Expedient for the cure.</P>
<P>THE People of <HI>Scotland</HI> being now reduced by Them to a more im∣plicit Obedience, and nobody daring to oppose the most extravagant pro∣ceedings of the most violent persons in Power, they lost no time, as hath been said, to make all preparations for a War they meant to pursue. Most <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of the King's Privy-Council and great Ministers, who (though they had not vigorously perform'd their duty in support of the Regal Power) till now had been so reserv'd that they Seem'd not to approve the Disor∣derly Proceedings, now as frankly wedded that Interest as any of the Leaders, and quickly became the Chief of the Leaders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> Joins with the Co∣venanters, notwithstand∣ing his great Obligations to the King.</NOTE> As the Earl of <HI>Argyle:</HI> who had been preserv'd by the King's im∣mediate Kindness and full Power, and rescued from the Anger and Fury of his incensed Father; who, being provoked by the Disobedience and Insolence of his Son, resolv'd so to have disposed of his Fortune, that little should have accompanied the Honour after his death. But by the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> King's interposition, and indeed imposition, the Earl, in strictness of the Law in <HI>Scotland,</HI> having need of the King's grace and protection, in regard of his being become Roman-Catholick, and his Majesty grant∣ing all to the Son which he could exact from the Father, the old man
<PB N="102" REF="1260"/>
was in the end compell'd to make over all his Estate to his Son; re∣serving only such a provision for Himself, as supported him according to his Quality during his Life, which he spent in the parts beyond the Seas. The King had too much occasion afterwards to remember, that in the close, after his Majesty had determin'd what should be done on either part; the old Man declared <Q>“”he would submit to the King's Pleasure, though he believ'd he was hardly dealt with,</Q> and then with some Bit∣terness put his Son in mind of his Undutyful carriage towards him, and charged him <Q>“”to carry in his mind how Bountiful the King had been to him;</Q> which yet, he told him, he was sure he would forget: and there <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> upon said to his Majesty <Q>“”Sir, I must know this Young man better than you can do; you have brought Me low, that you may raise Him; which I doubt you will live to repent; for he is a man of craft, subtilty, and falshood, and can love no man; and if ever he finds it in his power to do You a mischief,</Q> he will be sure to do it. The King consider'd it on∣ly as the effect of his Passion, and took no other care to prevent it but by heaping every day new obligations upon him; making him a Privy-Counsellor, and giving him other Offices and power to do Hurt, thereby to Restrain him from doing it; which would have wrought upon any Ge∣nerous Nature the Effect it ought to have done. The Earl (for his Father <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> was now dead) came not to <HI>Edenborough</HI> during the first Troubles; and though he did not dissemble his Displeasure against the Bishops, because one of them had Affronted him, intruth, very Rudely, yet he renew'd all imaginable professions of Duty to the King and a readiness to en∣gage in his Service, if those Disorders should continue: but after the Pa∣cification, and Disbanding of the King's Army, and the Covenanters de∣claring that they would adhere to the Acts of the Assembly at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> he made hast to <HI>Edenborough</HI> with a great train of his Family and Fol∣lowers; and immediately sign'd the Covenant, engaged for the provi∣sion of Arms, and raising Forces; and in all things behaved himself like <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> a man that might very safely be confided in by that Party.</P>
<P>THERE wanted not persons still who perswaded the King <Q>“”that all might yet be ended without Blood; that there were great Divisions amongst the chief Leaders, through emulations and ambition of com∣mand; and that the access of the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> to that Party, would drive others as considerable from it, who never did, nor ever would unite with Him in any design; and therefore advised "that his Majesty would require them to send some persons intrusted by their Body to attend him,</Q> and give an account of the Reasons of their Proceedings. They demanded a safe Conduct for the security of the persons they should <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> employ; which was sent accordingly: and thereupon some persons of the Nobility, and Others, were Commission'd to wait on the King; amongst which the Lord <HI>Lowden</HI> was principally relied on for his Parts and Abilities; a man who was better known afterwards, and whom there will hereafter be so often occasion to mention, as it will not be necessary in this place further to enlarge upon him.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter in∣tercepted from some of the <HI>Scottish</HI> No∣bility to the <HI>French</HI> King</NOTE> AT this time the King happen'd to intercept a Letter, which had been sign'd by the chief of the Covenanters, and particularly by the Lord <HI>Lowden,</HI> written to the <HI>French</HI> King; <Q>in which they complain'd “”of the Hardness and Injustice of the Government that was exercised over them; put him in mind of the Dependence this Kingdom former∣ly had upon that Crown; and desired him now to take them into His Protection, and give them Assistance; and that his Majesty would give entire credit to one <HI>Colvil,</HI> who was the Bearer of that Letter, and well instructed in all Particulars:</Q> and the Letter it self was seal'd, and di∣rected <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Au Roy;</HI> a style only used from Subjects to their natural King. This Letter being seen and perused by the Lords of the Council, and the Lord <HI>Lowden</HI> being examin'd, and refusing to give any other answer, than <Q>“”that it was writ before the Agreement, and thereupon reserv'd and never sent; that if he had committed any offence, he ought to be Question'd for it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and not in <HI>England;</HI> and insisting upon his safe Conduct,</Q> demanded liberty to return: All men were of opi∣nion that so soul a Conspiracy and Treason ought not to be so Slightly excused; and that both the Lord <HI>Lowden,</HI> and <HI>Colvil</HI> (who was likewise found in <HI>London</HI> and apprehended) should be committed to the Tower: <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> which was done accordingly; all men expecting that they should be brought to a speedy Tryal.</P>
<P>THIS Discovery made a very deep Impression upon the King; and perswaded him that such a foul Application could never have been thought of, if there had not been more Poyson in the heart than could be expell'd by easy Antidotes; and that the strongest Remedies must be provided to root out this Mischief: thereupon he first advised with that Committee of the Council which used to be consulted in Secret affairs, What was to be done? That Summers action had wasted all the Money that had been carefully laid up; and to carry on that vast Expence, the <MILESTONE N="$0" UNIT="line"/> Revenue of the Crown had been Anticipated; so that, though the raising an Army was visibly Necessary, there appear'd no means How to raise that Army. No Expedient occurr'd to them so proper as a Parliament, which had been now intermitted near twelve years. And though those Meetings had of late been attended by some Disorders, the effects of Mu∣tinous Spirits; and the last had been Dissolv'd (as hath been said before) with some circumstances of Passion and Undutifulness, which so far In∣censed the King that he was less inclined to those Assemblies; yet this long Intermission, and the general Composure of mens minds in a happy Peace, and universal Plenty over the whole Nation (superior sure to <MILESTONE N="$0" UNIT="line"/> what any other Nation ever enjoy'd) made it reasonably believ'd, not∣withstanding the murmurs of the People against some exorbitancies of the Court, that Sober men, and such as lov'd the Peace and Plenty they were possessd of, would be made choice of to serve in the House of Com∣mons; and then the temper of the House of Peers was not to be appre∣hended: but especially the opinion of the Prejudice and general Aversion over the whole Kingdom to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Indignation they had at Their presumption in their design of Invading <HI>England,</HI> made it believ'd that a Parliament would express a very sharp sense of their Insolence and carriage towards the King, and provide Remedies proportionable.</P>

<P>THAT it might appear that the Court was not at all apprehensive of what the Parliament would, or could do; and that it was Convened by his Majesty's grace and inclination, not by any motive of necessity; it proceeded in all respects in the same Unpopular ways it had done; Ship-money was levied with the same severity; and the same rigour <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> used in Ecclesiastical Courts, without the least compliance with the hu∣mour of any man; which look'd like Steadiness; and, if it were Then well pursued, degenerated too soon afterwards.</P>

<P>THE House met all ways at eight of the Clock, and rose at twelve; which were the old Parliament hours; that the Committees, upon whom the greatest burden of the business lay, might have the afternoons for Their preparation and dispatch. It was not the Custom to enter upon <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> any Important business in the first Fortnight; both because many Mem∣bers used to be absent so long; and that time was usually thought neces∣sary for the appointment and nomination of Committees, and for other Ceremonies and Preparations that were usual: but there was no regard Now to that Custom; and the appearance of the Members was very great, there having been a large time between the issuing out of the Writs and the meeting of the Parliament, so that all Elections were made, and return'd, and every body was willing to fall to the Work.</P>

Very many call'd <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> him to the Bar; and the Sollicitors Discourse was thought to have so much Weight in it, that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Peard</HI> very hardly escaped a severe Re∣prehension: which is mention'd only that the temper and sobriety of that House may be taken notice of, and their Dissolution, which shortly after fell out, the more lamented.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Parliament had not fate above six or seven days, and had managed all their Debates, and their whole Behaviour with won∣derful order and sobriety, the Court was Impatient that no advance was yet made towards a Supply; which was foreseen would take up much time, whensoever they went about it, though never so cordially; and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The House of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> therefore they prevail'd with the House of Peers, which was more en∣tirely at the King's disposal, that they would demand a Conference with the House of Commons, and then propose to them, by way of advice, <Q>“”that they would begin with giving the King a Supply, in regard of the urgency and even necessity of his affairs, and afterwards proceed upon their Grievances,</Q> or any thing else as they thought fit▪ and the House of Peers accordingly did give their advice to this purpose at a Conference. This Conference was no sooner reported in the House of Commons, than their whole Temper seem▪d to be shaken. It was the undoubted Funda∣mental priviledge of the Commons in Parliament, that all Supplies <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> should have their rise and beginning from Them; this had never been infringed, or violated, or so much as question'd in the worst Times; and that now after so long intermission of Parliaments, that all Priviledges might be forgotten, the House of Peers should begin with an action their Ancestors never attempted, administred too much cause of Jealousy of somewhat else that was intended; and so with an unanimous consent<NOTE PLACE="marg">This voted a Breach of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Commons.</NOTE> they declared it to be <Q>“”so high a Breach of Priviledge, that they could not proceed upon any other matter untill they first receiv'd Satisfaction and Reparation from the House of Peers;</Q> and which the next day they demanded a Conference. The Lords were sensible of their error; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> which had been foreseen, and disswaded by many of them; they <Q>“”ac∣knowledg▪d the Priviledge of the Commons as fully as they demanded it, and hoped they had not broken it by offering their advice to them
<PB N="107" REF="1310"/>
without mentioning the nature of the Supply, the proportion or man∣ner of raising it,</Q> which they confess'd belong'd entirely to Them: in fine, they desired them, <Q>“”that this might be no occasion of wasting their time, but that they would proceed their Own way, and in their Own method,</Q> upon the affairs of the Kingdom. This gave no satisfaction; was no reparation; and serv'd Their turn who had no mind to give any Supply without discovering any such dissatisfaction, which would have got them no credit, the House generally being exceedingly disposed to please the King, and to do him service. But this Breach of Priviledge, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> which was craftily enlarged upon as if it swallow▪d up all their other Pri∣viledges, and made them wholely subservient to the Peers, was univer∣sally resented. A Committee was appointed to examine Presidents of for∣mer times, in case of violation of their Priviledges by the Lords, though not of that magnitude, and thereupon to prepare a Protestation to be sent up to the House of Peers, and to be entred into their own Journal; and in the mean time no proceedings to be in the House upon any publick business, except upon some report from a Committee.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King▪s Proposition t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the House of Commons:</NOTE> AFTER some days had pass'd in this manner, and it not being in view when this debate would be at an end, the King thought of another expe∣dient, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and sent a message in writing to the Commons by S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> who was now both Secretary of State and Treasurer of the Houshold, and at that time of good credit there; wherein his Majesty took notice, <Q>“”that there was some difference between the two Houses, which re∣tarded the transaction of the great affairs of the Kingdom, at a time when a forreign Army was ready to invade it: That he heard the pay∣ment of Ship-money, notwithstanding that it was adjudged his right, was not willingly submitted to by the People; to manifest therefore his good affection to his Subjects in general, he made this Proposition, That if the Parliament would grant him twelve Subsidies to be paid <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in three years, in the manner proposed (that was, five Subsidies to be paid the first year, four the second, and three to be paid the last year) his Majesty would then release all his title or pretence to Ship-money for the future,</Q> in such a manner as his Parliament should advise.</P>
<P>THOUGH Exceptions might have been taken again in point of Pri∣viledge, because his Majesty took notice of the difference between the two Houses; yet that Spirit had not Then taken so deep root: so that they resolv'd to enter, the next day after the delivery of it, upon a full debate of his Majesty's message; they who desired to obstruct the giving any Supply, believing they should easily prevail to reject this proposition, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> upon the greatness of the sum demanded, without appearing not to favour the Cause in which it was to be employ'd, which they could not have done with any advantage to themselves, the number of that Classis of men being then not considerable in the House. It was about the first<NOTE PLACE="marg">This debated</NOTE> day of <HI>May</HI> that the Message was deliver▪d, and the next day it was re∣sumed about nine of the Clock in the Morning, and the debate continued till four of the Clock in the Afternoon; which had been seldom used be∣fore, but afterwards grew into custom. Many observ'd <Q>“”that they were to purchase a release of an Imposition very Unjustly laid upon the King∣dom, and by purchasing it, they should upon the matter confess it had <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> been Just;</Q> which no man in his heart acknowledg'd; and therefore wish'd <Q>“”that the Judgment might be first examin'd, and being once de∣clared Void, what they should present the King with, would appear a Gift,</Q> and not a Recompence: but this was rather modestly insinuated,
<PB N="108" REF="1320"/>
than insisted upon; and the greater number reflected more on the Pro∣portion demanded, which some of those who were thought very well to understand the state of the Kingdom, confidently affirm'd to be more than the whole stock in Money of the Kingdom amounted to; which ap∣pear▪d shortly after to be a very gross Miscomputation. There were very few, except those of the Court (who were ready to give all that the King would ask, and indeed had little to give of their own) who did not be∣lieve the Sum demanded to be too great, and wished that a less might be accepted, and therefore were willing, when the day was so far spent, that the Debate might be adjourn▪d till the next morning; which was <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> willingly consented to by all, and so the House rose. All this agitation had been in a Committee of the whole House, the Speaker having left the Chair, to which M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lenthall,</HI> a Lawyer of no eminent account, was call▪d. But there was not, in the whole day, in all the variety of contra∣dictions, an offensive or angry word spoken: except only that one private Country Gentleman little known, said, <Q>“”he observ▪d that the Supply was to be employ▪d in the supporting <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llum Episcopale,</HI> which he thought the Bishops were fittest to do themselves:</Q> but as there was no reply, or notice taken of it, so there was nobody, who seconded that en∣vious reflexion, nor any other expression of that kind. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THE next day as soon as the House met, and Prayers were read, it resolv'd again into a Committee of the whole House, the same Person being again call'd to the Chair: it was expected, and hoped, that there would have been some new message from the King, that might have fa∣cilitated the debate; but nothing appearing of that kind, the Proposition was again read, and men of all sides discoursed much of what had been said before, and many spoke with more reflection upon the Judgment of Ship▪money than they had done the day past, and seem'd to wish, <Q>“”that whatsoever they should give the King should be a free testimony of their affection and duty, without any release of Ship money, which de∣deserv▪d <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> no consideration,</Q> but in a short time would appear void and null. And this seem▪d to agree with the sense of so great a part of the House, that M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Hambden</HI> the most Popular man in the House (the same who had defended the Suit against the King in his own name, upon the Ille∣gality of Ship-money▪ thought the matter ripe for the Qnestion, and de∣sired the Question might be put, <Q>“”Whether the House would consent to the Proposition made by the King,</Q> as it was contain'd in the message? which would have been sure to have found a Negative from all who thought the Sum too great, or were not pleased that it should be given in recompence of Ship-money. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>WHEN many call▪d to have this Question, Serjeant <HI>Glanvile</HI> the Speaker (who sate by amongst the other Members whilst the House was in a Committee, and had rarely used to speak in such seasons) rose up, and in a most pathetical Speech, in which he excell▪d, endeavour'd to per∣swade the House <Q>“”to comply with the King's desire, for the good of the Nation, and to reconcile him to Parliaments for ever, which this sea∣sonable testimony of their affections would infallibly do.</Q> He made it manifest to them how very inconsiderable a Sum twelve Subsidies amounted to, by telling them, <Q>“”that he had computed what he was to pay for those twelve Subsidies,</Q> and when he named the Sum, he be∣ing <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> known to be possess'd of a great estate, it seem'd not worth any far∣ther Deliberation. And in the warmth of his Discourse, which he plain∣ly discern'd made a wonderful impression upon the House, he let fall some
<PB N="109" REF="1330"/>
sharp expressions against the Imposition of Ship-money, and the Judg∣ment in the point, which he said plainly <Q>“”was against Law, if he under∣stood what Law was (who was known to be very Learned) which expression,</Q> how necessary and artificial soever to reconcile the affections of the House to the matter in question, very much irreconciled him at Court, and to Those upon whom he had the greatest dependence.</P>
<P>THERE was scarce ever a Speech that more gather'd up and united the inclinations of a Popular Council to the Speaker: and if the Que∣stion had been presently put, it was believ'd the number of the Dissenters <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> would not have appear'd great. But after a short silence, some men, who wish'd well to the Main, express'd a dislike of the Way, so that other men recover'd new courage, and call'd again with some earnestness, <Q>“”that the Question formerly proposed by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden</HI> should be put;</Q> which seem'd to meet with a concurrence. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> then stood up, <Q>and desired “”that Question might not be put; said, it was a Captious question, to which only one sort of men could clearly give their Vote, which were They who were for a rejection of the King's Proposition, and no more resuming the debate upon that Subject: but that They who desired to give the King a Supply, as he believ'd most did, though not in such a <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> Proportion, nor, it may be, in that Manner, could receive no Satis∣faction by that question; and therefore He proposed, to the end that every man might frankly give his Yea, or his No▪ that the question might be put only, upon the giving the King a Supply, which being carried in the Affirmative, another question might be upon the Pro∣portion, and the Manner; and if the first were carried in the Negative, it would produce the same effect, as the other question proposed by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden</HI> would do.</Q></P>
<P>THIS method was receiv'd by some with great approbation, but op∣posed by others with more than ordinary Passion, and diverted by other <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Propositions, which being seconded took much time, without pointing to any Conclusion. In the end Serjeant <HI>Glanvile</HI> said, <Q>“”that there had been a Question proposed by his Country man, that agreed very well with His sense, and moved that the Gentleman might be call'd upon to propose it again.</Q> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> stated the case again as he had done, an∣swer'd somewhat that had been said against it, and moved <Q>“”that Question might be put.</Q> Whereupon for a long time there was nothing said, but a confused clamour, and call, <HI>M</HI><SUP>r</SUP> Hambden's <HI>Question,</HI> <HI>M</HI><SUP>r</SUP> Hyde's <HI>Que∣stion;</HI> the call appearing much stronger for the last, than the former: and it was generally believ'd that the Question had been put, and carried <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> in the Affirmative, though it was positively opposed by <HI>Herbert</HI> the Sol∣licitor General, for what reason no man could imagine, if S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane</HI> the Secretary had not stood up, and said, <Q>“”that, as it had been all∣ways his custom to deal plainly and clearly with that House in all things, so he could not but now assure them, that the putting, and car∣rying that Question, could be of no use; for that he was most sure, and had Authority to tell them so, that if they should pass a Vote for the giving the King a supply, if it were not in the Proportion and Manner proposed in his Majesty's message, it would not be accepted by him; and therefore desired that Question might be laid aside;</Q> which being <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> again urged by the Sollicitor General upon the Authority of what the other had declared, and the other Privy-Counsellors saying nothing, though they were much displeased with the Secretaries averment, the business was no more press'd: but it being near five of the Clock in the
<PB N="110" REF="1340"/>
afternoon, and every body weary, it was willingly consented to that the House should be adjourn'd till the next morning.</P>
<P>BOTH S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> and the Sollicitor General (whose opinion was of more weight with the King than the others) had made a worse repre∣sentation of the humour and affection of the House than it deserv'd, and undertook to know, that if they came together again, they would pass such a Vote against Ship-money, as would blast that Revenue and other branches of the Receipt; which Others believ'd they would not have had the confidence to have Attempted; and very Few, that they would have had the credit to have Compass'd. What follow'd in the next Par∣liament, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> within less than a year, made it believ'd, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane</HI> acted that part Maliciously, and to bring all into Confusion; he being known to have an implacable hatred against the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> Liev∣tenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whose destruction was then upon the anvil. But what transported the Sollicitor, who had none of the ends of the other, could not be imagin'd, except it was his pride, and peevishness, when he found that he was like to be of less Authority there, than he look'd to be; and yet he was heard with great attention, though his Parts were most pre∣valent in puzzling and perplexing that discourse he meant to cross. Let their motives be what they would, they Two, and they only, wrought <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> so far with the King, that without so much Deliberation as the affair was worthy of, his Majesty the next morning, which was on the Fifth of <HI>May,</HI> near a month after their first meeting, sent for the Speaker to at∣tend him, and took care that he should go directly to the House of Peers, upon some apprehension that if he had gone to the House of Commons, that House would have entred upon some ingrateful discourse; which they were not inclined to do: and then sending for that House to at∣tend<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment dissolv'd.</NOTE> him, the Keeper, by his Majesty's command, Dissolv'd the Par∣liament.</P>
<P>THERE could not a greater damp have seised upon the Spirits of the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> whole Nation, than this Dissolution caused; and men had much of the Mi∣sery in view, which shortly after fell out. It could never be hoped that more sober and dispassionate men would ever meet together in that place, or fewer who brought ill purposes with them; nor could any man ima∣gine what offence they had given, which put the King upon that reso∣lution. But it was observ'd, that in the countenances of Those who had most opposed all that was desired by his Majesty, there was a marvellous Serenity; nor could they conceal the Joy of their hearts: for they knew enough of what was to come, to conclude that the King would be short∣ly compell'd to call another Parliament, and they were as sure, that so <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> many, so unbiass'd men, would never be elected again.</P>
<P>WITHIN an hour after the dissolving, M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> met M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Saint-John,</HI> who had naturally a great cloud in his Face, and very seldom was known to smile, but Then had a most chearful aspect, and seeing the other me∣lancholick, as intruth he was from his heart, ask'd him, <Q>“”What troubled him?</Q> who answer'd, <Q>“”That the same that troubled Him, he believ'd troubled most Good men; that in such a time of Confusion, so wise a Parliament, which alone could have found Remedy for it, was so un∣seasonably dismiss'd:</Q> the other answer'd with a little warmth, <Q>“”That all was well; and that it must be Worse, before it could be Better; and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that this Parliament could never have done, what was necessary to be done:</Q> as indeed it would not, what He and His friends thought ne∣cessary.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's trouble for it afterwards.</NOTE> THE King, when he had better reflected upon what was like to fall out, and was better inform▪d of the temper and duty of the House of Commons, and that they had voted a Supply, if S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane</HI> had not hindred it by so positive a declaration that his Majesty would refuse it, was heartily Sorry for what he had done; declared with great anger, <Q>“”that he had never given him such Authority; and that He knew well that the giving him any Supply would have been welcome to him, be∣cause the reputation of his Subjects assisting him in that conjuncture, was all that he look'd for and consider'd.</Q> He consulted the same day, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> or the next, whether he might by his Proclamation recall them to meet together again: but finding that impossible, he fell roundly to find out all expedients for the raising of Money, in which he had so wonderful success, that, in less than three weeks, by the voluntary loan of the par∣ticular Lords of the Council, and of other Private Gentlemen about the City, some relating to the Court, and others strangers to it, there was no less than three hundred thousand pounds paid into the Exchequer to be issued out as his Majesty should direct: a Sum that sufficiently mani∣fests the plenty of that Time, and greater than most Princes in <HI>Europe</HI> could have commanded in so short a time; and was an unanswerable evi∣dence, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that the hearts of his Subjects were not then alien'd from their duty to the King, or a just jealousy for His honour.</P>
<P>ALL diligence was used in making Levies, in which few of the Ge∣neral<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Army raised.</NOTE> Officers which had been employ'd the year before were made use of; though it was great pity that the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was not again taken in; which had infallibly preserv'd him from swerving from his Duty, and he would have discharged his trust with Courage and Fidelity, and there∣fore probably with Success: but he was of a haughty Spirit, and did not think his last Summers Service so well requited, that he was earnestly to sollicit for another Office; though there is no doubt but he would have <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> accepted it if it had been offer'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Northumber∣land</HI> made Ge∣neral.</NOTE> A GENERAL was appointed, the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> and the Lord <HI>Conway</HI> General of the Horse: which made the great Officers of the former year, the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> (who thought themselves free from any Oversights that had been committed) more capable of Infusions by those who were ready to work according to the Occurrences upon their several constitutions. But the reputation of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who had indeed arrived at a wonderful general estimation, was believ'd to be most instrumental in it: and the Lord <HI>Conway</HI> was thought an able Soldier, and of great <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Parts. Besides, the Earls of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> were thought less go∣vernable by those Councils to which the main was then to be intrusted, the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> bearing a part in them; to whom the first was very averse, and the latter irreconcileable.</P>
<P>DISPATCHES were sent into <HI>Ireland</HI> to quicken the Preparations there, which the Earl had left in a great forwardness, under the care of the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> his Lievtenant General: Moneys issued out for the levies of Horse and Foot there, and for the making a Train: all which were as well advanced, as, considering the general Discomposure, could be reasonably expected.</P>

<PB N="112" REF="1360"/>
and esteem in many Worthy men of very different qualifications. He had been born a Soldier in his Father's Garrison of the <HI>Brill,</HI> when he was Governour there; and bred up, in several Commands, under the par∣ticular care of the Lord <HI>Vere,</HI> whose Nephew he was; and though he was married young, when his Father was Secretary of State, there was no Action of the <HI>English</HI> either at Sea or Land, in which he had not a con∣siderable Command; and allways preserv▪d a more than ordinary Reputa∣tion, in spight of some great Infirmities, which use to be a great allay to the credit of active men; for he was a voluptuous man in eating and drinking, and of great licence in all other excesses, and yet was very ac∣ceptable <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to the strictest, and the gravest men of all conditions. And which was stranger than all this, he had allways (from his Pleasure, to which his nature excessively inclined him, and from his Profession, in which he was diligent enough) reserv'd so much time for his Books and Study, that he was well versed in all parts of Learning, at least appear'd like such a one in all occasions, and in the best companies. He was of a very pleasant and inoffensive Conversation, which made him generally very accepta∣ble: so that the Court being at that time full of Faction, very few loving one another, or those who resorted to any who were not lov'd by them, He alone was even domestick with all, and not suspected by either of the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Lords or the Ladies factions.</P>
<P>THE War was generally thought to be as well provided for, as, after the last years miscarriage, it could be, by His being made General of the Horse; and no man was more pleased with it, than the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who had contracted an extraordinary opinion of this man, and took great delight in his company, he being well able to speak in the affairs of the Church, and taking care to be thought by him a very zea∣lous defender of it; when they who knew him better, knew he had no kind of sense of Religion, and thought all was alike. He was sent down with the first Troops of Horse, and Foot, which were levied, to the Bor∣ders <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to attend the motion of the Enemy, and had a Strength sufficient to stop them if they should attempt to pass the River, which was not fordable in above one or two places, there being good Garrisons in <HI>Berwick</HI> and <HI>Carlisle.</HI> And in this posture he lay near <HI>Newburn</HI> in the out-skirts of <HI>Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P>WHILST these things were thus publickly acted, private agitations were not less vigorously intended. The Treaty and Pacification of the former year, had given an opportunity of forming Correspondences, and contriving Designs, which before had been more clandestine; and the late meetings in Parliament had brought many together, who could not <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> otherwise have met, and discover'd humours and affections, which could not else have been so easily communicated. The Court was full of Fa∣ction and Animosity, each man more intending the ruin of his Adver∣sary, and satisfying his private Malice, than advancing his Master's Ser∣vice, or complying with his Publick duty, and to that purpose directing all their endeavours, and forming all their intercourse; whilst every man unwisely thought him whom he found an Enemy to his Enemies, a Friend to all his other affections; or rather by the narrowness of his understanding, and extent of his passion, contracted all his other affections to that one of Revenge. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>AND by this means those Emissaries and Agents for the Confusion which was to follow, were furnish'd with opportunity and art to Intangle all those (and God knows they were a great many) who were transported
<PB N="113" REF="1370"/>
with those vulgar and vile Considerations: cheap, senseless Libels were scatter'd about the City, and six'd upon Gates and publick remarkable places, traducing and vilifying Those who were in highest trust and em∣ployment: Tumults were raised, and all licence both in actions and words taken; insomuch as a Rabble of mean, unknown, dissolute persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tumult about <HI>Lam∣beth</HI> House.</NOTE> to the number of some thousands, attempted the House of the Lord Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> with open profession and protestation, "that they would tear him in pieces; which (though one of that Rabble, a Saylor, was apprehended and executed in <HI>Southwark,</HI> upon an Indict∣ment <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of High Treason) was so just a cause of Terrour, that the Arch-Bishop, by the King's command, lodged for some days and nights in <HI>White-Hall;</HI> which place likewise was not unthreatned in their seditious meetings and discourses. This infamous, scandalous, headless Insurre∣ction, quash'd by the deserv'd death of that Varlet, was not thought to be contrived or fomented by any persons of Quality: yet it was di∣scoursed after in the House of Commons by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Strode</HI> (one of those <HI>Ephori</HI> who most avow'd the curbing and suppressing of Majesty) with much pleasure and content; and it was mention'd in the first draught of the first Remonstrance (when the same was brought in by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym)</HI> not <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> without a touch of approbation, which was for that reason somewhat al∣ter'd, though it still carried nothing of censure upon it in that piece.</P>
<P>THINGS standing thus both in Court and City, and the <HI>Scots</HI> preparing with great industry for Invasion, and we, at least, for a Defence, on a sud∣dain the Lord <HI>Lowden</HI> (who before was said to be committed for desiring protection and aid from the <HI>French</HI> King, by a Letter under his hand) was discharged from his Imprisonment; without imparting that resolu∣tion to the Council; and after a few days admittance and kind reception at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> was dismis'd into <HI>Scotland;</HI> his authority and power with that People being as considerable as any man's and his conduct as <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> necessary for the enterprizes they had in hand. This Stratagem was ne∣ver understood; and was then variously spoken of: many believing he had undertaken great matters for the King in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to quiet that Distemper: others, that it was an act entirely compass'd by the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who was like to stand in need of great Supporters, by that extraordinary obligation to endear himself with that Nation; or to com∣municate somewhat to that Nation, if his condition before were so good that it needed no endearment. They who publish'd their thoughts least, made no scruple of saying, <Q>“”that if the policy were good and necessary of his first commitment, it seem'd as just and prudent to have coutinued <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> him in that restraint.</Q></P>
<P>THE progress in the King's advance for <HI>Scotland,</HI> was exceedingly hindred by the great and dangerous sickness of the Earl of <HI>Northumber∣land</HI> the General, whose recovery was either totally despair'd of by the Physician, or pronounced to be expected very slowly; so that there would be no possibility for him to perform the Service of the North: whereupon he sent to the King, to desire that he would make choice of another General. And though the Lord <HI>Conway</HI> in all his Letters sent advertisement, <Q>“”that the <HI>Scots</HI> had not advanced their Preparations to that degree that they would be able to march that Year,</Q> yet the King <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> had much better Intelligence that they were in readiness to move; and so concluded that it was necessary to send another General; and design'd the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> for that Command, and to leave the Forces in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> which were raised to make a diversion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be govern'd
<PB N="114" REF="1380"/>
by the Earl of <HI>Ormond.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was scarce recover'd from a great sickness, yet was willing to undertake the charge, out of pure indignation to see how few men were forward to serve the King with that vigour of mind they ought to do; but knowing well the mali∣cious designs which were contrived against himself, he would rather serve as Lievtenant-General under the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> than that He should resign his Commission: and so, with and under that qua∣lification, he made all possible hast towards the North, before he had strength enough for the journey.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Conway</HI> routed at <HI>Newburn</HI></NOTE> BUT before he could arrive with the Army, that infamous irrepara∣ble <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Rout at <HI>Newburn</HI> was fall▪n out; where the Enemy march'd at a time and place, when and where they were expected, through a River deep though fordable, and up a Hill, where our Army was ranged to receive them: through those difficulties and disadvantages, without giving or taking any Blows (for the five or six men of ours who were kill'd, fell by their Canon, before the passing of the River) they put our whole Army to the most shameful and confounded Flight that was ever heard of; our Foot making no less hast from <HI>Newcastle,</HI> than our Horse from <HI>Newburn;</HI> both leaving the Honour, and a great deal of the Wealth of the Kingdom, arising from the Coal-mines, to Those who had not confi∣dence <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> enough (notwithstanding the evidence they had seen of our fear) to possess that Town in two days after; not believing it possible that such a place, which was able to have maintain'd the War alone some time, could be so kindly quitted to them: The Lord <HI>Conway</HI> never after turning his face towards the Enemy, or doing any thing like a Com∣mander, though his Troops were quickly brought together again, without the loss of a dozen men, and were so ashamed of their flight, that they were very willing as well as able to have taken what revenge they would upon the Enemy, who were possess'd with all the fears imaginable, and would hardly believe their own success, till they were assured that the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Lord <HI>Conway</HI> with all his Army rested quietly in <HI>Durham,</HI> and then<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tee <HI>Scots</HI> Ar∣my enter <HI>Newcastle:</HI></NOTE> they presumed to enter into <HI>Newcastle.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it seem'd afterwards to be a full vindication of the Honour of the Nation, that, from this infamous Defeat at <HI>Newburn,</HI> to the last en∣tire Conquest of <HI>Scotland</HI> by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Army scarce perform'd one signal action against the <HI>English,</HI> but were allways beaten by great inequality of numbers as oft as they encountred, if they were not sup∣ported by <HI>English</HI> Troops.</P>
<P>IN this posture the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> found the Army about <HI>Dur∣ham,</HI> bringing with him a body much broken with his late sickness, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> which was not clearly shaken off, and a mind and temper confessing the dregs of it, which being marvellously provoked and inflamed with in∣dignation at the late Dishonour, render'd him less gracious, that is, less inclined to make himself so, to the Officers, upon his first entrance into his charge; it may be, in that mass of disorder, not quickly discerning to whom kindness and respect was justly due. But those who by this time no doubt were retain'd for that purpose, took that opportunity to incense the Army against him; and so far prevail'd in it, that in a short time it was more inflamed against Him than against the Enemy; and was willing to have their want of courage imputed to excess of Con∣science, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and that their being not satisfied in the grounds of the Quarrel was the only cause that they fought no better. In this Indisposition in all parts, the Earl found it necessary to retire with the Army to the
<PB N="115" REF="1390"/>
skirts of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and himself to <HI>York</HI> (whither the King was come)<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Army retreat∣ing towards <HI>York.</HI></NOTE> leaving <HI>Northumberland</HI> and the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham</HI> to be possess'd by the Victors; who being abundantly satisfied with what they never hoped to possess, made no hast to advance their new Conquests.</P>
<P>IT was very much wonder'd at, that the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> upon his first arrival at the Army, call'd no persons to a Council of War for that shameful business of <HI>Newburn,</HI> or the more shameful quitting of <HI>New∣castle</HI> (where were not ten barrels of Musquet-Bullets, nor Moulds to make any; the Enemy having been long expected there, and our Army <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> not less than a Month in that Town; time enough, if nothing had been done before, to have made that place tenable for a longer time than it could have been distress'd). Whether the Earl saw that it would not have been in His power to have proceeded finally and exemplarily upon that inquisition, and Therefore chose rather not to enter upon it; or whe∣ther he found the Guilt to be so involv'd, that though some were more Obnoxious, few were unfaulty; or whether he plainly discern'd to what the Whole tended, and so would not trouble himself further in discover∣ing of that, which, instead of a Reproach, might prove a Benefit to the per∣sons concern'd; I know not: but publick Examination it never had.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> THE <HI>Scots</HI> needed not now advance their Progress; their Game was in the hands (no prejudice to their skill) of better Gamesters. Besides, they were not to make the least inroad, or to do the least trespass to their Neighbours of <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> who were as sollicitous, that by any access or concurrence of the strength of that large County, they should not be driven farther back; and therefore instead of drawing their Train'd Bands together (which of themselves would have been a greater or better Army than was to contend with them) to defend their County, or the Person of the King then with them, they prepared Petitions of advice and good counsel to him to call a Parliament, and to remove all other Grievances <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> but the <HI>Scots.</HI> At the same time some Lords from <HI>London</HI> (of known, and since publish'd affections to that Invasion) attended his Majesty at <HI>York</HI> with a Petition, sign'd by others, eight or ten in the whole, who were craftily perswaded by the Leigers there, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Saint-John,</HI> to concur in it, being full of duty and modesty enough; without considering that nothing else at that time could have done mischief; and so suffer'd themselves to be made Instruments to∣wards those Ends which intruth they abhor'd.</P>
<P>IN these distractions and discomposures, between an Enemy proud and insolent in success, an Army corrupted, or at least disheartned, a <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> County mutinous and inclined to the Rebels, at least not inclined to re∣duce them, and a Court infected with all three, the King could not but find himself in great straits; besides that his Treasure, which had hither∣to kept that which was best from being worse, was quite spent. The raising and disbanding the first Army so unfortunately and wretchedly, had cost full three hundred thousand pounds, which the good husbandry of the Ministers of the Revenue had treasured up for an emergent occa∣sion: and the borrowing so much money for the raising and supplying this latter Army, had drawn assignments and anticipations upon the Re∣venue to that degree, that there was not left wherewithall to defray the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> necessary expence of the King's Houshold. A Parliament would not be easily thought of, on this consideration, that it could not come together speedily enough to prevent that mischief to which it should be chiefly applied: for if we were not then in a condition to defend our selves, in
<PB N="116" REF="1400"/>

The Arch-Bishop, besides the sole disposal of whatsoever concern'd the Church, which was an invidious province, having been from the death of the Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> (at which time he was made Commissioner of the Treasury) more engaged in the Civil busi∣ness, than I am perswaded he desired to be; and throughout the whole business passionately concern'd for the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and so, con∣versant in those transactions: by all which means, besides that he had usually about him an uncourtly quickness, if not sharpness, and did not sufficiently value what men said or thought of him; a more than ordi∣nary <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Prejudice and Uncharitableness was contracted against him; to which the new Canons, and the circumstances in making them, made no small addition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of Strafford,</NOTE> THE Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> had for the space of allmost six years entirely govern'd <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he had been compell'd, upon reason of State, to exercise many acts of Power; and had indulged some to his own ap∣petite and passion, as in the cases of the Lord Chancellor, and the Lord <HI>Mount-Norris;</HI> the first of which was <HI>satis pro imperio,</HI> but the latter, if it had not concern'd a person notoriously unbelov'd, and so the more unpitied, would have been thought the most extravagant peice of Sove∣raignty, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that in a time of Peace had been ever executed by any Sub∣ject. When and why he was call'd out of <HI>Ireland</HI> to assist in Council here, I have touch'd before. He was a man of too high and severe a de∣portment, and too great a contemner of ceremony to have many Friends at Court, and therefore could not but have Enemies enough: hehad Two that profess'd it, the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane;</HI> thefirst could never forget or forgive a sharp suddain Saying of his (for I cannot call it counsel or advice) when there had been some difference a few years before between his Lordship and the Lord <HI>Weston,</HI> in the ma∣naging whereof the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was confined to his House, <Q>“”that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the King should do well to cut off his head.</Q> which had been aggra∣vated (if such an injury were capable of aggravation) by a succession of Discountenances mutually perform'd between them to that time. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane</HI> had not far to look back to the time that the Earl had with great earnestness opposed his being made Secretary, and prevail'd for above a months delay; which, though it was done with great reason and justice by the Earl, on the behalf of an old Fellow-servant, and his very good Friend, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Coke</HI> (who was to be, and, afterwards, was re∣mov'd to let Him in) yet the justice to the One, lessen'd not the sense of unkindness to the Other: after which, or about the same time (which <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> it may be made the other to be the more virulently remembred) being tobe made Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> he would needs in that Patent have a new creation of a Barony, and was made Baron of <HI>Raby,</HI> a House belonging to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> and an Honour he made account should belong to himself; which was an act of the most unnecessary provocation (though he contemn'd the man with marvellous scorn) that I have known, and I believe was the chief occasion of the loss of his head. To these a Third adversary (like to be more pernicious than the other Two) was added, the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> naturally enough disinclined to his Person, his Power, and his Parts, upon some rough carriage of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>'s to∣wards <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the late Earl of <HI>Saint Albans,</HI> to whom he had a friendship, and therefore openly profess'd to be revenged. Lastly he had an Enemy more terrible than all the other, and like to be more fatal, the whole
<PB N="119" REF="1430"/>
<HI>Scotish</HI> Nation, provoked by the Declaration he had procured of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> and some high carriage and expressions of his against them in that Kingdom. So that He had reason to expect as hard measure from such Popular Councils as he saw were like to be in request, as all those Dis∣advantages could create towards him. And yet no doubt his confidence was so great in Himself, and in the form of Justice (which he could not suspect would be so totally confounded) that he never apprehended a greater censure than a Sequestration from all Publick Employments, in which it is probable he had abundant satiety: and this considence <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> could not have proceeded (considering the full knowledge he had of his Judges) but from a proportionable stock of, and satisfaction in, his own Innocence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI></NOTE> THE Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> though he was a very wise man, yet having spent the greatest part of his life in <HI>Spain,</HI> and so having been allways subject to the unpopular imputation of being of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Faction; in∣deed was better skill'd to make his Master great abroad, than gracious at home; and being Chancellor of the Exchequer from the time of the Dissolution of the Parliament in the Fourth year, had his hand in many hard shifts for Money; and had the disadvantage of being suspected at <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> least a Favourer of the Papists (though that Religion thought it self no∣thing beholding to him) by which he was in great umbrage with the People: and then though he were much less hated than either of the other two, and the less, because there was nothing of kindness between the Arch-Bishop and him; and indeed very few particulars of moment could be proved against him: yet there were two objections against him, which render'd him as odious as any to the great Reformers; the one, that he was not to be reconciled to or made use of in any of their designs; the other, that he had two good Offices, without the having of which their Reformation could not be perfect: for besides being Chancellor of the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Exchequer, he was likewise Master of the Wards, and had raised the Re∣venue of that Court to the King to be much greater than it had ever been before His administration; by which husbandry all the rich Fami∣lies of <HI>England,</HI> of Noblemen and Gentlemen, were exceedingly in∣censed, and even indevoted to the Crown, looking upon what the Law had intended for their Preservation, to be now applied to their De∣struction; and therefore resolv'd to take the first opportunity to ravish that Jewel out of the Royal Diadem, though it were fasten'd There by the known Law, upon as unquestionable a Right, as the Subject enjoy'd any thing that was most his Own.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marquis of <HI>Hamilton.</HI></NOTE> THE Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> if he had been then weigh'd in the Scales of the People's hatred, was at that time thought to be in greater danger than any one of the other; for he had more Enemies, and fewer Friends, in Court or Country, than any of the other. His interest in the King's affection was at least equal, and thought to be superior, to any man's; and he had receiv'd as invidious instances, and marks of those affections. He had more out-faced the Law in bold Projects and Pressures upon the People, than any other man durst have presumed to do, as especially in the projects of Wine and Iron; about the last of which, and the most gross, he had a sharp contest with the Lord <HI>Coven∣try</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> (who was a good Wrestler too) and at last compell'd him to let it pass the Seal: the entire profit of which allways reverted to Himself, and to such as were his Pensioners. He had been the sole manager of the business of <HI>Scotland</HI> till the Pacification; the readiest man, though Then
<PB N="120" REF="1440"/>
absent, to advise that Pacification, and the most visible Author of the breach of it. Lastly, the Discoveries between the Lord <HI>Mackey</HI> and <HI>David Ramsay,</HI> by which the Marquis was accused of designing to make himself King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were fresh in many mens memories, and the late passages in that Kingdom had revived it in others; so that He might reasonably have expected as ill a presage for himself from those Fortune tellers, as the most Melancholick of the other: but as he had been allways most careful and sollicitous for Himself, so he was most likely to be apprehensive on his Own behalf, and to pro∣vide accordingly. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>AND here I cannot omit a Story which I receiv'd from a very good hand, by which his great subtilty and industry for himself may appear, and was indeed as great a piece of Art (if it were Art) as I believe will be found amongst the modern Politicians. After the call∣ing the Council of the Peers at <HI>York</HI> was resolv'd upon, and a little before the time of their apearance, the Marquis came to the King, and with some cloudiness (which was not unnatural) and trouble in his countenance, he desired his Majesty to give him leave to Travel; the King surprized was equally troubled at it, and demanded his rea∣son: he told him, <Q>“”he well foresaw a Storm, in which His shipwrack <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> was most probable amongst others; and that he, never having any thing before his eyes but his Majesty's Service, or in his vows, but an entire simple obedience to His commands, might happily by his Own unskilfulness in what was fit by any other rule, be more obnoxious than other men; and therefore, that with his Majesty's leave, he would withdraw himself from the hazard at least of that Tempest.</Q> The King, most graciously inclined to him, bid him <Q>“”be most confi∣dent, that though he might (which he was resolv'd to do) gratify his People with any reasonable indulgence, he would never fail his good Servants in that protection which they had equal reason to expect <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> from him. The Marquis with some quickness replied, "that the knowledge of that gracious disposition in his Majesty, was the prin∣cipal cause that he besought leave to be absent; and that otherwise he would not so far desert his own Innocence, which he was sure could be only sullied and discredited with Infirmities and Indiscre∣tions, not tainted or defaced with Design and Malice. But (said he) I know your Majesty's goodness will interpose for me to your Own prejudice: and I will rather run any fortune, from whence I may again return to serve you, than be (as I foresee I should be) so im∣mediate a cause of damage and mischief to so Royal a Master.</Q> He <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> told him, <Q>“”that he knew there were no less fatal arrows aim'd at the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> than at him∣self; and that he had advertised the first, and advised the last, to take the same course of withdrawing whereby He meant to secure himself: but (he said) the Earl was too great-hearted to Fear, and he doubted the other was toobold to Fly.</Q></P>
<P>THE King was much disturb'd with the probability and reason of what was said; which the other as soon observing, <Q>“”There is (said he) one way by which I might secure my self without leaving the King∣dom, and by which your Majesty, as these times are like to go, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> might receive some advantage; but it is so contrary to my nature, and will be so scandalous to my honour in the opinion of men, that, for my own part,</Q> I had rather run my fortune. His Majesty, glad
<PB N="121" REF="1450"/>
that such an expedient might be found (as being unwilling to hazard his safety against so much reason as had been spoken, by compelling him to stay; and as unwilling, by suffering him to go, to confess an apprehension that he might be imposed upon) Impatiently ask'd <Q>“”What that way was?</Q> The Marquis replied, <Q>“”That he might endear him∣self to the other Party by promising his Service to them, and seem∣ing to concur with them in Opinions and Designs; the which he had reason to believe the principal Persons would not be averse to, in hope that his supposed interest in his Majesty's opinion might be <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> look'd upon as of moment to them for their particular Recommen∣dations. But, he said, this he knew would be look'd upon with so much Jealousy by other men, and shortly with that Reproach, that he might by degrees be lessen'd even in his Majesty's own trust; and therefore it was a province he had no mind to undertake:</Q> and so re∣new'd his Suit again very earnestly for leave to travel.</P>
<P>THE King, for the reasons aforesaid, much delighted with this Ex∣pedient, and believing likewise, that intruth he might by this means frequently receive Informations of great use, and having a singular esteem of the Fidelity and Affection of the Marquis, told him positive∣ly, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”That he should not leave him; that he was not only contented, but commanded him to Ingratiate himself by any means with the other People,</Q> and assured him <Q>“”that it should not be in any body's power to infuse the least jealousy of him into his Royal breast.</Q> The which resolution his Majesty observ'd so constantly, that the other en∣joy'd the liberty of doing whatsoever he found necessary for his own behoof: and with wonderfull craft and low condescensions to the ends and the appetites of very inferior people, and by seasonable insinua∣tions to several leading persons (of how different inclinations soever) of such particulars as were grateful to them, and seem'd to advance <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> their distinct and even contrary Interests and Pretences, he grew to have no less credit in the Parliament than with the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commis∣sioners; and was with great vigilance, industry, and dexterity, pre∣serv'd from any Publick Reproach in those charges which serv'd to ruin other men, and which with more reason and justice might have been applied to Him than any other; and yet for a long time he did not incur the jealousy of the King; to whom he likewise gave many advertisements, which if there had been persons enough who would have concurr'd in prevention, might have proved of great use.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de∣clares to the great Council at <HI>York</HI> his resolutions to call a Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> IN this state and condition were Things and Persons when the Lords came to <HI>York</HI> to the great Council in <HI>September;</HI> and the first day of their meeting (that the counsel might not seem to arise from them who were resolv'd to give it, and that the Queen might receive the honour of it, who, the King said, had by a Letter advised him to it; as his Majesty exceedingly desired to endear her to the People) the King declared to them, <Q>“”that he was resolv'd to call a Parliament to assemble at <HI>Westminster</HI> the third day of <HI>November</HI> following;</Q> which was as soon as was possible.

the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and as passionate hope of the Presidentship of the North which the Earl had, made applicable to any end; but other∣wise a person of so ill a fame, that many desired not to mingle in coun∣sels with him.

This Petition, full of as much Submission as a Victory it¦self could produce (as was urged by some Lords) could not but beget a Treaty, and a Treaty was resolved on speedily to be at <HI>Rippon,</HI> a place in the King's Quarters: but then, special care was taken, by caution given to his Majesty, that no such ungracious persons might be intrusted <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> by him in this Treaty as might beget Jealousies in the <HI>Scots,</HI> and so ren∣der it fruitless: and therefore the Earls of <HI>Hertford, Bedford, Pem∣broke, Salisbury, Essex, Holland, Bristol,</HI> and <HI>Berkshire,</HI> the Lords <HI>Mandevile, Wharton, Dunsmore, Brook, Savile, Paulet, Howard</HI> of <HI>Escrick</HI> (the Lord <HI>Say</HI> being sick, and so not present at <HI>York)</HI> were chosen by the King; all Popular men, and not one of them of much in∣terest in the Court, but only the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who was known to be fit for any counsel that should be taken against the Earl of <HI>Straf∣ford,</HI> who had among them scarce a Friend or person civilly inclined towards him. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>

The <HI>Scots</HI> applied themselves most particularly to the Earls of <HI>Bedford, Essex, Holland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Mandevile,</HI> though in publick they seem'd e∣qually to caress them all; and besides the duty they profess'd to the King in the most submiss expressions of reverence that could be used, they made great and voluminous expressions <Q>“”of their affection to the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Kingdom and People of <HI>England;</HI> and remembred the infinite obli∣gations they had from time to time receiv'd from this Nation; espe∣cially the assistance they had from it in their reformation of Religion, and their attaining the light of the Gospel; and therefore as it could never fall into Their hearts to be ungrateful to it,</Q> so they hoped that the good People of <HI>England</HI> would not entertain any ill opinion of <Q>“”their coming into this Kingdom at this time in a Hostile manner, as if they had the least purpose of doing wrong to any particular person, much less to alter any thing in the Government of the Kingdom; pro∣testing that they had the same tenderness of Their Laws and Li∣berties, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and Priviledges, as of their Own; and that they did hope, as the Oppressions upon their native Country, both in their Civil and Spiritual Rights, had obliged them to This manner of Address to the
<PB N="123" REF="1470"/>
King, to whom all access had been denied them by the power of their Enemies; so, that this very manner of their coming in might be for the good of This Kingdom, and the benefit of the Subjects thereof, in the giving them opportunities to vindicate their own Liberties and Laws; which, though not Yet so much invaded as those of <HI>Scotland</HI> had been, were enough infringed by Those very men who had brought so great Misery and Confusion upon that Kingdom; and who in∣tended, when they had finish'd their work There, and in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to establish the same slavery in <HI>England</HI> as they had brought upon the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> other two Kingdoms. All which would be prevented by the Removal of three or four Persons from about the King; whose Own gra∣cious disposition and inclination would bountifully provide for the Happiness of all his Dominions, if Those ill men had no influence upon his Counsels.</Q></P>
<P>THERE was not a man of all the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners to whom this kind of discourse was not grateful enough, and who did not pro∣mise to Himself some convenience that the Alterations which were like to happen might produce. And with those Lords with whom they de∣sired to enter into a greater confidence, they conferr'd more openly and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> particularly, of the three Persons towards whom their greatest prejudice was, the Arch-Bishop, the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and the Marquis of <HI>Ha∣milton</HI> (for in their whole discourses they seem'd equally at least in∣censed against Him, as against either of the other two) whom they re∣solv'd should be removed from the King. They spake in confidence <Q>“”of the excess of the Queen's power, which in respect of her Religion, and of the Persons who had most interest in her, ought not to prevail so much upon the King as it did in all affairs. That the King could never be happy, nor his Kingdom flourish, till he had such Persons about him in all Places of trust, as were of Honour and Experience in <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> affairs, and of good Fortunes and Interests in the affections of the Peo∣ple; who would allways inform his Majesty that his own greatness and happiness consisted in the execution of Justice, and the happiness of his Subjects; and who are known to be zealous for the preserva∣tion and advancement of the Protestant Religion, which every honest man thought at present to be in great danger, by the exorbitant power of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and some other Bishops who were govern'd by him.</Q> It was no hard matter to insinuate into the Persons with whom they held this discourse, that They were the very men who they wish'd should be in most credit about the King; and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> they concluded that their affections were so great to this Kingdom, and they so desired that all Grievances might be redress'd here, that though they should receive present Satisfaction in all that concern'd Themselves, they would not yet return, till provision might likewise be made for the just interest of <HI>England,</HI> and the reformation of what was amiss There in reference to Church and State.</P>
<P>THIS appear'd so hopeful a Model to most of the King's Commis∣sioners (who having no method perscribed to them to treat in, were in∣deed sent only to hear what the <HI>Scots</HI> would propose, the King him∣self then intending to determine what should be granted to them) they <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> never consider'd the Truth of any of their allegations, nor desired to be inform'd of the Ground of their proceedings; but patiently hearkned to all they said in publick, of which they intended to give an account to the King; and willingly heard all they said in private, and made such
<PB N="124" REF="1480"/>
use of it as they thought most conduced to their Own ends. The <HI>Sco∣tish</HI> Commissioners proposed, <Q>“”that for the avoiding the effusion of Christian blood, there might be some way found to prevent all acts of Hostility on either side; which could not possibly be done, except some order was given for the payment of Their Army, which was yet restrain'd to close and narrow Quarters.</Q> And the truth is, they were in daily fear that those Quarters would have been beaten up, and so the ill Courage of those men too easily discover'd, who were more taught to sing Psalms, and to Pray, than to use their Arms; their hopes of pre∣vailing being, from the beginning, founded upon an assurance that they <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> should not be put to Fight.</P>
<P>THERE had been in that infamous rout at <HI>Newburn</HI> two or three Officers of Quality taken Prisoners, who, endeavouring to charge the Enemy with the courage they ought to do, being deserted by their Troops could not avoid falling into the <HI>Scots</HI> hands; two of which were <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who was Commissary-General of the Horse, and <HI>O Neal</HI> who was Major of a Regiment; both Officers of name and reputation, and of good esteem in the Court with all Those who were incensed against the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> towards whom they were both very indevoted. These Gentlemen were well known to several of the principal Com∣manders <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in the <HI>Scots</HI> Army (who had serv'd together with them in <HI>Hol∣land</HI> under the Prince of <HI>Orange)</HI> and were treated with great civi∣lity in their Camp; and when the Commissioners came to <HI>Rippon,</HI> they brought them with them, and presented them to the King by his Com∣missioners, to whom they were very acceptable; and did those who deliver'd them more Service by the Reports they made of them in the Army when they return'd to their Charges, and in the Court, than they could have done by remaining Prisoners with them; and contri∣buted very much to the irreconciling the Army to the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> who was to command it. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>AFTER few days the Commissioners return'd to the King at <HI>York,</HI> and gave him an account of what had pass'd, and of the extraordinary affection of the <HI>Scots</HI> to his Majesty's Service; and <HI>Wilmot</HI> and <HI>O Neal</HI> magnified the good discipline and order observ'd in the Army, and made their numbers to be believ'd much superior to what in truth they were.</P>

The Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> was young, and used to discourse with his Majesty in his Beb-chamber rather than at the Council-Board, and a man of Honour and Fidelity in all <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> places; and in no degree of confidence with his Country-men, because he would not admit himself into any of their Intrigues. The Marquis had leave to be wary, and would give his Enemies no new advantages.</P>

NOR indeed was there any man's advice of much credit with the King, but that of the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> who had no reason to declare his opinion upon so nice a subject in the presence of the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane;</HI> and thought there was only one way to be pur∣sued (which was not to be communicated at the Council) and that was to drive the <HI>Scots</HI> out of the Kingdom by the Army: and without con∣sidering what was done at the Treaty (which had not yet agreed upon any Cessation) he sent a good Party of Horse, commanded by Major <HI>Smith,</HI> to fall upon a <HI>Scotish</HI> Quarter in the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> defeated two or three of their Troops and took all their Officers Pri∣soners, and made it manifest enough that the Kingdom might be rid of the rest, if it were vigorously pursued; which the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> heartily intended. But <HI>Lesly,</HI> the <HI>Scotish</HI> General, complain'd <Q>“”that He himself had forborn to make any such attempt out of respect to the Treaty;</Q> and the <HI>English</HI> Commissioners thought Themselves neglected, and affronted by it. And when it was found that the Officer who con∣ducted that enterprize was a Roman-Catholick, it made more noise; and they prevail'd with the King to restrain his General from giving out any more such Orders.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> THE King begun so far to dislike the temper of his Commissioners, that he thought the Parliament would be more jealous of his Honour, and more sensible of the Indignities he suffer'd by the <HI>Scots,</HI> than the Commissioners appear'd to be; and therefore he sent them back to <HI>Rip∣pon</HI> again to renew the Treaty, and to conclude a Cessation of Arms upon as good terms as they could; so that the <HI>Scots</HI> Army might not ad∣vance into <HI>Yorkshtre,</HI> nor enlarge their Quarters any way beyond what they were already possess'd of: and this concession being agreed to, they should not enter upon any other particulars, but adjourn the Treaty to <HI>London;</HI> which was the only thing the <HI>Scots</HI> desired, and without <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> This they could never have brought their designs to pass. When the other Lords return'd to <HI>Rippon,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> (as a man of a great fortune, and at that time very popular) was sent with two or three other Lords to <HI>London,</HI> with a Letter from the King, and a subscription from the Lords Commissioners of the Treaty (which was then more powerful) to borrow two hundred thousand pounds from the City, for the payment of both Armies whilst the Cessation and Treaty should con∣tinue; <Q>“”which they hoped would quickly be at an end, and the <HI>Scots</HI> return into their own Country.</Q> The City was easily perswaded to furnish the money, to be repaid out of the first that should be raised by <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the Parliament; which was very shortly to meet.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Cessatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> agreed on.</NOTE> THE Commissioners at <HI>Rippon</HI> quickly agreed upon the Cessation; and were not unwilling to have allow'd fifty thousand pounds a month for the support of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, when they did assign but thirty thousand pounds a month for the payment of the King's; and to have taken the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners words for their Musters, which made their numbers so much superior to the other: but that sum of fifty thousand pounds a month was afterwards reduced to about five and twen∣ty thousand; and the whole amounting to above fifty thousand pounds a month, was a sum too great for the Kingdom to pay long, as was <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> then generally believ'd. It was pretended that two months would put an end to the Treaty; so that the two hundred thousand pounds, which the City had supplied, would discharge all the Disbanding: and in this hope the King confirm'd the Cessation, and sent a safe Conduct for such
<PB N="126" REF="1500"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> Commissioners as the <HI>Scots</HI> should think fit to send to <HI>London</HI> for the carrying on the Treaty.</P>
<P>ALL which being done, the King and the Lords left <HI>York,</HI> that they might be at <HI>London</HI> before the beginning of the Parliament; the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> staying still in the North to put the Army into as good a posture as he could, and to suppress the Mutinous spirit it was inclined to; and if it were possible, to dispose that great County (of which he had the entire command) to a better temper towards the King's Service, and to a greater indignation towards the <HI>Scots;</HI> of whom they did not use to have too charitable an opinion. But in both these applications he <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> underwent great mortifications; the Officers of the Army every day asking his leave to repair to <HI>London,</HI> being chosen to serve in Parlia∣ment; and when he denied to give them Passes, they went away with∣out them: and the Gentlemen of the Country who had most depended upon him, and been obliged by him, withdrawing their application and attendance, and entring into combination with his greatest Enemies against him.</P>
<P>IT is not to be denied, the King was in very great Straits, and had it not in his power absolutely to choose which way he would go; and well foresaw, that a Parliament in that conjuncture of affairs would not <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> apply natural and proper Remedies to the Disease: for though it was not imaginable it would run the courses it afterwards did, yet it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enough he must resign very much to their affections and appe∣tite (which were not like to be contain▪d within any modest bounds) and therefore no question his Majesty did not think of calling a Parlia∣ment at first, but was wrought to it by degrees: Yet the great Coun∣cil could not but produce the other; where the unskilfulness and passion of some for want of discerning Consequences, and a general sharpness and animosity against Persons, did more mischief than the power or ma∣lice of Those who had a form'd design of Confusion: for without doubt <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that Fire at that time (which did shortly after burn the whole King∣dom) might have been cover'd under a bushel. So as intruth there was no Counsel so necessary then, as for the King to have continued in his Army, and to have drawn none thither but such as were more afraid of dishonour than danger; and to have trusted the justice and power of the Law with suppressing of Tumults, and quieting Disorders in his rear.</P>
<P>IT is strange, and had somewhat of a Judgment from Heaven in it, that all the industry and learning of the late years had been bestow'd in finding out and evincing, that in case of Necessity any extraordinary <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> way for Supply was Lawful; and upon that ground had proceeded when there was No necessity; and now when the Necessity was appa∣rent, Money must be levied in the ordinary course of Parliament, which was then more extraordinary than the other had been; as <HI>York</HI> must be defended from an Enemy within twenty five miles of it, by Money to be given at <HI>London</HI> six Weeks after, and to be gather'd within six Months. It had been only the season and evidence of Necessity that had been question'd; and the view of it in a Perspective of State at a di∣strance that no eyes could reach, denied to be ground enough for an Imposition: as no man could pull down his neighbours house because it <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> stood next Furse, or Thatch, or some combustible matter which might take fire; though he might do it when that combustible matter was really a fire. But it was never denied that <HI>flagrante bello,</HI> when an Ene∣my
<PB N="127" REF="1510"/>
had actually invaded the Kingdom, and so the Necessity both seen and felt, all mens goods are the goods of the Publick, to be applied to the Publick safety, and as carefully to be repair'd by the Publick stock. And it is very probable (since the Factions within, and the Correspon∣dence abroad was so apparent, that a Parliament then call'd would do the business of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and of Those who invited them hither) that if the King had positively declared, that he would have no Parliament as long as that Army staid in <HI>England,</HI> but as soon as they were re∣tired into their own Country he would summon one, and refer all mat∣ters <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to Their advice, and even be advised by Them in the composing the distractions of <HI>Scotland:</HI> I say, it is probable, that they would ei∣ther willingly have left the Kingdom, or speedily have been compell'd; there being at that time an Army in <HI>Ireland</HI> (as was said before) ready to have visited <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>NEITHER would the Indisposition of the King's Army (which was begot only by those Infusions, that there must of necessity be a Par∣liament, which would prevent farther Fighting) have lasted, when they found those Authors confuted; for the Army was constituted of good Officers, which were more capable of being deceiv'd by their <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Friends, than imposed upon by their Enemies; and they had their Sol∣diers in good devotion, and the business of <HI>Newburn</HI> would rather have spurr'd them on than restrain'd them And it had been much the best course that could have been taken, if, after the fright at <HI>Newburn,</HI> the King as well as the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> had made hast to <HI>Durham</HI> and kept that Post, without staying at <HI>York;</HI> and after some exemplary Justice and Disgrace upon the chief Officers who were Faulty, till the Army had recover'd their Spirits (which in a very short time it did with shame and indignation enough) had march'd directly against the <HI>Scots;</HI> by which they would have speedily dispossess'd them of their new <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Conquest, and forced them to have run distracted into their own Coun∣try; as may be reasonably concluded from their behaviour whenever they were assaulted afterwards by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>AND it is as strange that the experience of the last Summer, when the attendance of so great a number of the Nobility (who had no mind to the War, and as little devotion to the Court) was the true ground and cause of that ridiculous Pacification, did not prevail with the King never to convene the same company to him again; which could do him very little good if they had desired it; and could not but do him more harm than even the worst of them at that time intended to do: <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> For it might very easily have been foreseen, that the calling so many dis∣contented, or disobliged, or disaffected men together, with a liberty to consult and advise, very few whereof had that inclination and reve∣rence for the Person of the King they ought to have had, though scarce any of them had at that time that mischief in their hearts which they afterwards discover'd against him, or indeed had the least pur∣pose to Rebel: I say the calling such men together, could not but make men much worse than they came, and put worse thoughts into their heads than they brought with them, when the Miscarriage as well as the Misfortune of the Court would be the common argument and di∣scourse; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and when they would quickly discern, that it was like to be in every one of Their powers to contribute to the Destruction, at least to the Disgrace, of Men they had no kindness for, and most of them great animosity against.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="1520"/>
BuT the King was without the presence and attendance of any man in whose judgment and wisdom he had a full confidence; for the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was at the Army; and they who first proposed the call∣ing the Peers, knew well enough that the King knew Parliaments too well to be inclined to call one if they should propose it; and there∣fore They proposed another expedient, which he knew not; and so was surprized with the advice (which he thought could do no harm) and gave direction for the issuing out of the Writs, before he enough consi∣der'd whether it might not intruth produce some mischief he had not well thought of; as he quickly found. Nor did the <HI>Scots</HI> themselves re∣solve <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to give him more disquiet in the ensuing Parliament, than the major part of his great Council that he brought together resolv'd to con∣cur with them in: and with that disposition, which they could never have contracted if they had remain'd by themselves, they all hasten'd to the place where they might do the Mischief they intended.</P>
<P>THE next Error to this was, that at the meeting of the great Coun∣cil at <HI>York,</HI> and before any consent to the Treaty at <HI>Rippon,</HI> there was not a state made, and information given of the whole Proceedings in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and thereupon some debate and judgment by the whole Coun∣cil before the Sixteen departed, for their information and instruction: <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and this had been strangely omitted before at the Pacification, inso∣much as many who had been employ'd in that first at <HI>the Berkes,</HI> and in the last at <HI>Rippon,</HI> confess'd that none of them (and they were of the Prime Quality) then did, or ever after, know any thing of the Laws and Customs of that Kingdom (by which they might have judged whe∣ther the King had exceeded his just power, or any thing of the mat∣ter of fact in the several transactions) but what they had receiv'd at those meetings from the persons who were naturally to make their own defence, and so by accusing others to make their own case the more plausible; in which it could not be expected they would mention any¦thing <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to their own disadvantage.</P>
<P>BY Them they weretold <Q>“”of a Liturgy imposed upon them by their Bishops, contrary to, or without Act of Parliament, with strange cir∣cumstances of Severity and Rigour: of some clauses in that Liturgy, different from that of the Church of <HI>England,</HI></Q> with pretty smart com∣ments of advice, and animadversions upon those Alterations: <Q>“”of a Book of Canons, in which an extraordinary and extravagant power was asserted to the Bishops: of a High Commission Court, which ex∣ceeded all limits, and censured all degrees of men: of the insolent Speeches of this Bishop to that Nobleman, and of the Ill Life of ano¦ther: <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of their Own great Humility and Duty to their sacred Sovereign, without whose Favour and Protection they would not live:</Q> and last∣ly, <Q>“”of their several most submiss Addresses, by Petition and all other ways to his Majesty; being desirous, when their Grievances were but heard, to lay Themselves and their Complaints at his Royal Feet, and to be most entirely disposed by him in such manner, as to His wis∣dom alone should be thought fit: but that by the power and inter∣position of their Adversaries, all their Supplications had been rejected, and They never yet admitted to be heard.</Q></P>
<P>WITH these and the like Artifices the good Lords were so wrought upon, and transported, that they easily Consented to whatsoever was <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> proposed: nor was there any Proposition made and insisted on by them at the first or second Treaty, which was not for the matter fully Con∣sented
<PB N="129" REF="1530"/>
to: whereas, if their Lordships had been fully advertised of the whole truth (though there had been some Inadvertencies and Inco∣gitancy in the circumstances of the transaction) his Majesty had full power, by the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> then in force, to make that Reformation he intended. All their Petitions and Addresses had found most gracious acceptance, and receiv'd most gracious answers. But on the contrary, They had invaded all the Rights of the Crown, alter'd the Government, affronted the Magistrates and Ministers of Justice, and his Majesty's own Regal Authority, with unheard of Insolences and Contempts; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> rejected all his offers of Grace and Pardon, and without cause or provo∣cation denounced War against him; besieged and taken the Castle of <HI>Edenborough,</HI> and other Places which held for his Majesty. I say, if This had been made as evident to them as surely it might have been made, it is not possible but those Noble persons would have preserv'd themselves from being deluded by them; at least many of the Inconve∣niences which after ensued would have been prevented, if the form and method of their Proceedings had been prescribed, or better look'd into.</P>
<P>BUT it must be confess'd, that in that conjuncture such necessary Evi∣dence <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and Information could very hardly be given: for though it must not be doubted that there were many particular Persons of Honour of that Nation who abhor'd the Outrages which were committed, and retain'd within their own breasts very Loyal wishes for his Majesty's Prosperity; yet it cannot be denied that those persons, who by the Places they held (of King's Advocate, and other Offices) ought to have made that Information of matter of Law, and matter of Fact, were Themselves the most active Promoters of the Rebellion; and the Defe∣ction was so general, and so few declared, or were active on his Ma∣jesty's behalf, that they who were not corrupted in their inward Fidelity, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> were so Terrified, that they durst not appear in any Office that might provoke Those who solely had the power and the will to destroy them.</P>
<P>THE last and most confounding Error was the removing the Trea∣ty to <HI>London,</HI> and upon any terms consenting that the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commis∣sioners should reside there before a Peace concluded. By which means, they had not only opportunity to publish all their Counsels and Dire∣ctions in their Sermons to the People (who resorted thither in incredible numbers) and to give their Advice, from time to time, to Those of the <HI>English</HI> who knew not so well yet to compass their Own ends, but <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> were ready (when any business was too big and unweildy to be managed by the few who were yet throughly engaged) to interpose in the name of Their Nation, and with reference to Things or Persons to make such demands from and on the behalf of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as under no other style would have receiv'd any countenance: and this brought that universal Terror with it (as will appear to the life in the process of this History) upon Those of nearest relation to the King's Ser∣vice, as well as Those at a greater distance, who clearly discern'd and detested the Villany and Wickedness of those transactions, that their wariness and wisdom could not be great enough to preserve them, if they <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> did not stupidly look on without seeming to understand what they could in no degree controul or prevent.</P>
<P>IN all Conspiracies there must be great secrecy, consent, and union; yet it can hardly be conceiv'd, with what entire Confidence in each
<PB N="130" REF="1540"/>
other, the numerous and not very rich Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> (for of the Common People, who are naturally very dependent on the other, there can be no wonder) concurr'd in the carrying on this Rebellion: their strange Condescension and Submission to their ignorant and inso∣lent Clergy, who were to have great Authority because they were to inflame all sorts of men upon the obligations of Conscience; and in or∣der thereunto, and to revenge a little Indiscretion and Ill Manners of some of the Bishops, had liberty to erect a Tribunal the most Ty∣rannical over all sorts of men, and all the Families of the Kingdom: so that the Preacher reprehended the Husband, govern'd the Wife, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> chastised the Children, and insulted over the Servants, in the Houses of the Greatest men. They refer'd the management and conduct of the whole Affair to a Committee of a few, who had never before exercised any Office or Authority in the Publick, with that perfect resignation and obedience, that nobody presumed to enquire What was to be done, or to murmur at, or censure any thing that Was done; and the Ge∣neral himself, and the Martial affairs, were subject to this <HI>Regimen</HI> and Discipline as well as the Civil: yet They who were intrusted with this Superiority, paid all the Outward respect and reverence to the person of the General, as if all the power and disposal had been in Him <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> alone.</P>
<P>THE few <HI>English</HI> (for there were yet but very few who were in∣trusted from the Beginning of the enterprize, and with all that was Then projected) were men of reserv'd and dark natures, of great indu∣stry and address, and of much reputation for probity and integrity of life, and who trusted none, but those who were contented to be trusted to that degree as they were willing to trust them, without being in∣quisitive into more than they were ready to communicate, and for the rest depended upon their discretion and judgment; and so prepared and disposed, by second and third hands, many to concur and contri∣bute <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to several preparatory actions, who would never have con∣sented to the conclusions which naturally resulted from those pre∣mises.</P>
<P>THIS united strength, and humble and active temper, was not en∣counter'd by an equal providence and circumspection in the King's Councils, or an equal temper and dutiful disposition in the Court; nor did they who resolv'd honestly and stoutly to discharge the offices of good Servants and good Subjects to the utmost opposition of all un∣lawful attempts, communicate their purposes to men of the same Inte∣grity, that so they might unite their counsels as well in the manner <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and way, as their resolutions in the end. But every one thought it enough to preserve his own innocence, and to leave the Rest to those who should have authority to direct. The King was perplex'd and irreso∣lute, and according to his natural constitution (which never disposed him to jealousy of any man of whom he had once thought well) was full of hope, that his condition was not so bad as it seem'd to be. The Queen wish'd much better to the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> than to the Arch-Bishop or the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> neither of Them being in any de∣gree acceptable to her; so that she was little concern'd for the dan∣ger that threatned them: but when she saw the King's Honour and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Dignity invaded in the prosecution, she withdrew her favour from the Earl of <HI>Holland:</HI> but then she was perswaded, by those who had most credit with her, to believe, that by the removal of the great
<PB N="131" REF="1550"/>
Ministers, Her power and authority would be encreased, and that the prevailing Party would be willing to depend upon her; and that by gratifying the principal Persons of them with such Prefer∣ments as they affected, she would quickly reconcile all ill humours: and so she hearkned to any overtures of that kind; which were allways carried on without the consent or privity of those who were con∣cern'd, who intruth more disliked Her absolute power with the King, than any other Excess of the Court, and look'd upon it as the greatest Grievance. Every man There consider'd only what application would <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> be most like to raise his Own fortune, or to do Those harm with whom he was angry, and gave himself wholely up to those Artifices which might promote either. To preserve themselves from the displea∣sure and censure of the Parliament, and to render themselves gracious to Those who were like to be powerful in it, was all men's business and sollicitude. And in this very unequal and disproportion'd condition and temper, was the King's and the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army, the Court and the Country, when the Parliament met.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ment met <HI>November</HI> the Third <HI>1640.</HI></NOTE> <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Parliament met upon the Third of <HI>No∣vember</HI> 1640, with a fuller appearance than could be reasonably expected, from the short time for Elections after the issuing out the Writs; insomuch as at the first not many Members were absent. It had a sad and a malancholick aspect upon the first entrance, which presaged some unusual and unnatural events. The King himself did not ride with <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> his accustom d Equipage nor in his usual ma∣jesty to <HI>Westminster,</HI> but went privately in his Barge to the Parliament Stairs, and after to the Church, as if it had been to a return of a pro∣rogued or adjourn'd Parliament. And there was likewise an untoward, and intruth an unheard of accident, which broke many of the King's measures, and infinitely disorder'd his Service beyond a capacity of repa∣ration. From the time the calling a Parliament was resolv'd upon, the King design'd S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Gardiner,</HI> who was Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> to be Speaker in the House of Commons; a man of gravity and quickness, that had somewhat of authority and gracefulness in his person and pre∣sence, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and in all respects equal to the Service. There was little doubt but that he would be chosen to serve in one of the four places for the City of <HI>London,</HI> which had very rarely rejected their Recorder upon that occasion; and lest that should fail, diligence was used in one or two other places that he might be elected. The opposition was so great, and the Faction so strong, to hinder his being elected in the City, that four
<PB N="136" REF="1580"/>
others were chosen for that Service, without hardly mentioning his name: nor was there less industry used to prevent his being chosen in other places; Clerks were corrupted not to make out the Writ for one place, and ways were found out to hinder the Writ from being executed in another, time enough for the return before the meeting: so great a fear there was, that a man of entire affections to the King, and of prudence enough to manage those affections, and to regulate the contrary, should be put into the Chair. So that the very morning the Parliament was to meet, and when the King intended to go thither, he was inform'd that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Gardiner</HI> was not return'd to serve as a Member in the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> House of Commons, and so was not capable of being chosen to be Speaker; so that his Majesty deferr'd his going to the House till the afternoon, by which time he was to think of another Speaker.</P>
<P>UPON the perusal of all the Returns into the Crown Office, there were not found many Lawyers of eminent Name (though many of them proved very Eminent men afterwards) or who had serv'd long in former Parliaments, the experience whereof was to be wish'd; and men of that Profession had been most commonly thought the most proper for that Service, and the putting it out of that Channel at that time was thought too hazardous: so that, after all the deliberation the shortness <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of that time would admit, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lenthall,</HI> a Bencher of <HI>Lincolns</HI>-Inn (a Lawyer of competent practice, and no ill reputation for his affection to the Government both of Church and State) was pitch'd upon by the King, and with very great difficulty rather prevail'd with than per∣swaded to accept the charge. And no doubt a Worse could not have been deputed of all that Profession who were then return'd; for he was a man of a very narrow, timorous nature, and of no experience or conver∣sation in the affairs of the Kingdom, beyond what the very drudgery in his Profession (in which all his design was to make himself rich) en∣gaged him in. In a word, he was in all respects very unequal to the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Work, and not knowing how to preserve his Own dignity, or to restrain the licence and exorbitance of Others, his Weakness contributed as much to the growing Mischiefs, as the Malice of the principal contrivers. However, after the King had that afternoon recommended the distracted condition of the Kingdom (with too little Majesty) to the wisdom of the two Houses of Parliament, to have such reformation and remedies ap∣plied as They should think fit, proposing to them, as the best rule for their Counsels, <Q>“”that all things should be reduced to the practice of the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI></Q> the House of Commons no sooner return'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Lenthall</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Speaker.</NOTE> to their House, than they chose M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lenthall</HI> to be their Speaker; and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> two days after, with the usual ceremonies and circumstances, presented him to the King, who declared his acceptation; and so both Houses were ready for the Work.</P>
<P>THERE was observ'd a marvellous elated countenance in many of the Members of Parliament before they met together in the House; the same men who six months before were observ'd to be of very moderate tempers, and to wish that gentle remedies might be applied, without opening the wound too wide and exposing it to the air, and rather to cure what was amiss than too strictly to make inquisition into the causes and original of the malady, talk'd Now in another dialect both of Things <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and Persons; and said <Q>“”that they must now be of another temper than they were the last Parliament; that they must not only sweep the House clean below, but must pull down all the Cobwebs which hung
<PB N="137" REF="1590"/>
in the top and corners, that they might not breed dust, and so make a foul House hereafter; That they had now an opportunity to make their Country happy, by removing all Grievances, and pulling up the Causes of them by the Roots,</Q> if all men would do their duties; and used much other sharp discourse to the same purpose: by which it was discern'd, that the warmest and boldest counsels and overtures, would find a much better reception than those of a more temperate allay; which fell out accordingly: and the very first day they met together, in which they could enter upon business, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym,</HI> in a long, form'd di∣scourse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Pym</HI> be∣gins the de∣bate of Grie∣vances.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> lamented the miserable state and condition of the Kingdom, ag∣gravated all the particulars which had been done amiss in the Govern∣ment, as <Q>“”done and contrived maliciously, and upon deliberation, to change the whole Frame, and to deprive the Nation of all the Liberty and property which was their Birthright by the Laws of the Land, which were now no more consider'd, but subjected to the arbitrary power of the Privy-Council, which govern'd the Kingdom according to Their will and pleasure; these Calamities falling upon us in the reign of a pious and virtuous King, who lov'd his People, and was a great lover of Justice.</Q> And thereupon enlarging in some specious com∣mendation <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of the nature and goodness of the King, that he might wound him with less suspicion, he said, <Q>“”We must enquire from what Foun∣tain these Waters of bitterness flow'd; what persons They were who had so far insinuated themselves into his Royal affections, as to be able to pervert his excellent Judgment, to abuse his Name, and wickedly apply His authority to countenance and support their Own corrupt de∣signs. Though he doubted there would be Many found of this <HI>classis,</HI> who had contributed their joint endeavours to bring this misery upon the Nation; Yet he believ'd there was One more signal in that admi∣nistration than the rest, being a man of great parts and contrivance, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and of great industry to bring what he design'd to pass; a man, who in the memory of many present, had sate in that House an earnest vin∣dicator of the Laws, and a most zealous assertor and champion for the Liberties of the People; but that it was long since he turn'd Apo∣state from those good affections, and according to the custom and na∣ture of Apostates, was become the greatest Enemy to the Liberties of his Country, and the greatest promoter of Tyranny that any age had produced.</Q> And then he named <Q>“”the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> Lord Lievte∣nant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and Lord President of the Council establish'd in <HI>York</HI> for the Northern Parts of the Kingdom; who, he said, had in <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> both Places, and in all other Provinces wherein his service had been used by the King, raised ample monuments of his Tyrannical nature; and that he believ'd, if they took a short survey of his actions and behaviour, they would find him the principal Author and Promoter of all those Councils which had exposed the Kingdom to so much ruin:</Q> and so instanced in some high and imperious actions done by him in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>Ireland,</HI> some proud and over confident expres∣sions in discourse, and some passionate advices he had given in the most secret Councils and debates of the affairs of State; adding some lighter passages of his vanity and amours; that they who were not in∣flamed <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> with anger and detestation against him for the former, might have less esteem and reverence for his prudence and discretion: and so concluded, <Q>“”That they would well consider how to provide a Remedy proportionable to the Disease, and to prevent the farther Mischiefs

they were ro expect from the continuance of this great man's power and credit with the King, and his influence upon His counsels.</Q></P>
<P>FROM the time that the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was named, most men be∣liev'd, that there would be some Committee appointed to receive infor∣mation of all his miscarriages, and that, upon report thereof, they would farther consider what course to take in the examination and prosecu∣tion thereof: but they had already prepared and digested their business to a riper period.</P>
<P>M<SUP>r</SUP> PYM had no sooner finish'd his discourse, than S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Clotwor∣thy</HI> (a Gentleman of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and utterly unknown in <HI>England,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> was, by the contrivance and recommendation of fome powerful persons, return'd to serve for a Burrough in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> that so he might be enabled to act This part against the Lord Lievtenant) made a long and confused relation <Q>“”of his Tyrannical carriage in that Kingdom; of the Army he had raised there to invade <HI>Scotland;</HI> how he had threatned the Parliament, if they granted not such Supplies as he required; of an Oath he had framed to be administred to all the <HI>Scotish</HI> nation which inhabited that Kingdom, and his severe proceedings against some Persons of Quality who refused to take that Oath;</Q> and that he had with great pride and passion publickly declared at his leaving that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”Kingdom, If ever he should return to that Sword, he would not leave a <HI>Scotish</HI>-man to inhabit in <HI>Ireland:</HI></Q> with a multitude of very exalted expressions, and some very high actions in his administration of that Go∣vernment, in which the Lives as well as the Fortunes of men had been disposed of out of the common road of Justice: all which, made him to be look'd upon as a man very terrible, and under whose authority men would not choose to put themselves.</P>
<P>SEVERAL other Persons appearing ready to continue the discourse, and the morning being spent, so that, according to the observation of Parliament hours, the time of rising was come, an Order was suddainly <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> made <Q>“”that the door should be shut, and nobody suffer'd to go out of the House;</Q> which had rarely been practised: care having been first taken, to give such advertisement to some of the Lords that that House might likewise be kept from rising; which would otherwise very much have broken their measures.</P>
<P>THEN S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> and some other <HI>Yorkshire</HI> men, who had re∣ceiv'd some disobligation from the Earl in the Country, continued the Invective, mentioning many particulars of his imperious carriage, and that he had, in the face of the Country, upon the execution of some il∣legal Commission, declared, <Q>“”that they should find the little finger of the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> King's Prerogative heavier upon them than the loyns of the Law;</Q> which expression, though upon after-examination it was found to have a quite contrary sense, marvellously increased the Passion and Prejudice towards him.</P>
<P>IN conclusion, after many hours of bitter inveighing, and ripping up the course of his life Before his coming to Court, and his actions Af∣ter, it was moved, according to the the secret Resolution taken before, "that he might be forthwith Impeach'd of High Treason; which was no sooner mention'd, than it found an universal approbation and consent from the whole House: nor was there, in all the debate, one person <MILESTONE N="5$" UNIT="line"/> who offer'd to stop the Torrent by any favourable testimony concerning the Earl's carriage, save only that the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> (who was very well known to be far from having any kindness for him) when the Pro∣position
<PB N="139" REF="1610"/>
was made for the Present accusing him of High Treason, mo∣destly desired the House to consider, <Q>“”Whether it would not suit better with the gravity of their Proceedings, first to digest many of those particulars which had been mentioned, by a Committee, before they sent up to accuse him? declaring himself to be abundantly satisfied that there was enough to charge him:</Q> which was very ingenuously, and frankly answer'd by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym,</HI> <Q>“”That such a delay might probably blast all their hopes, and put it out of their power to proceed farther than they had done already; that the Earls power and credit with <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the King, and with all those who had most credit with King or Queen, was so great, that when he should come to know that so much of his Wickedness was discover'd, his own Conscience would tell him What he was to expect; and therefore he would undoubtedly procure the Parliament to be Dissolv'd, rather than undergo the Justice of it, or take some other desperate course to preserve Himself, though with the hazard of the Kingdom's ruin: Whereas, if they presently sent up to impeach him of High Treason before the House of Peers, in the Name and on the Behalf of all the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> who were repre∣sented by them, the Lords would be obliged in Justice to commit him <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> into safe custody, and so sequester him from resorting to Council, or having access to his Majesty; and then they should proceed against him in the usual form with all necessary expedition.</Q></P>
<P>TO those who were known to have no kindness for him, and seem'd to doubt whether all the particulars alledged, being proved, would amount to High Treason, it was alledged, <Q>“”That the House of Com∣mons were not Judges, but only Accusers, and that the Lords were the proper Judges whether such a complication of enormous crimes in one person did not amount to the highest offence the Law took notice of, and therefore that it was fit to present it to Them.</Q> These reasons <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of the hast they made, so clearly deliver'd, gave that universal satis∣faction, that without farther considering the Injustice and Unreasonable∣ness of it, they voted unanimously (for ought appear'd to the contrary by any avow'd contradiction) <Q>“”that they would forthwith send up to<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Common<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> im<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each the Earl of <HI>Straf∣ford</HI> of High Treason.</NOTE> the Lords and accuse the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> of High Treason, and seve∣ral other Crimes and Misdemeanours, and desire that he might be presently sequestred from the Council,</Q> and committed to safe custody; and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> was made choice of for the Messenger to perform that office. This being determin'd, the doors were open'd, and most of the House accompanied him on the Errand.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> IT was about three of the Clock in the afternoon, when the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> (being infirm, and not well disposed in his health, and so not having stirr'd out of his house that morning) hearing that both Houses still sate, thought fit to go thither. It was believ'd by some (upon what ground was never clear enough) that he made that haste then to ac∣cuse the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> and some others, of having induced the <HI>Scots</HI> to in∣vade the Kingdom; but he was scarce entred into the House of Peers, when the message from the House of Commons was call'd in, and when M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> at the Bar, and in the Name of all the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> impeach'd <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> (with the addition of all his other <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Titles) of High Treason, and several other heinous Crimes and Misde∣meanours, of which he said the Commons would in due time make proof in form; and in the mean time desired in Their name, that he might be sequestred from all Councils, and be put into safe custody: and
<PB REF="1620"/>
so withdrawing, the Earl was, with more clamour than was suitable to the gravity of that Supream Court, call'd upon to Withdraw, hardly obtaining leave to be first heard in his place, which could not be de∣nied him.</P>
<P>HE then lamented <Q>“”his great Misfortune to lie under so heavy a charge; profess'd his Innocence and Integrity, which he made no doubt he should make appear to them; desired that he might have his Li∣berty, untill some Guilt should be proved; and desired them to consi∣der, what mischief they should bring upon Themselves, if upon such a general charge, without the mention of any one crime, a Peer of the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Realm should be committed to Prison, and so deprived of his Place in that House, where he was summon'd by the King's Writ to assist in their Counsels; and of what consequence such a Precedent might be to their Own Priviledge and Birthright:</Q> and then withdrew. The<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl is committed to the Black-red.</NOTE> Peers with very little debate resolv'd <Q>“”he should be committed to the custody of the Gentleman Usher of the Black-rod, there to remain un∣till the House of Commons should bring in a particular Charge against him: which determination of the House was pronounced to him at the Bar upon his Knees, by the Lord Keeper of the great Seal, upon the Wool-sack: and so being taken away by <HI>Maxwell,</HI> Gentleman <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Usher, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> was call▪d in, and inform'd what the House had done; after which (it being then about four of the Clock) both Houses adjourn'd till the next day.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN this work was so prosperously over, they begun to consider, that notwithstanding all the Industry that had been used to procure such Members to be chosen, or return'd though not chosen, who had been most refractory to the Government of the Church and State; yet that the House was so constituted, that when the first heat (which allmost all men brought with them) should be a little allay'd, violent counsels would not be long hearkned to: and therefore, As they took great care <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> by the Committee of Elections to remove as many of those Members as they suspected not to be inclinable to their Passions, vpon pretence "that they were not regularly chosen, that so they might bring in others more pliable in Their places; in which no rule of Justice was so much as pretended to be observ▪d by them; insomuch as it was often said by leading men amongst them, <Q>“”that they ought in those cases of Ele∣ctions to be guided by the fitness and worthiness of the Person, what∣soever the desire of those was, in whom the Right of Election re∣main▪d;</Q> and therefore one man hath been admitted upon the same rule by which another hath been rejected: So they declared, <Q>“”That no <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> person, how Lawfully and Regularly soever chosen and return'd, should be and sit as a Member with them, who had been a party or fa∣vourer of any Project, or who had been employ'd in any Illegal Com∣mission.</Q></P>
<P>BY this means (contrary to the Customs and Rights of Parliament) many Gentlemen of good Quality were removed, in whose places com∣monly others were chosen of more agreeable dispositions: but in this likewise there was no rule observ'd; for no person was hereby removed, of whom there was any hope that he might be applied to the violent courses which were intended. Upon which occasion the King charged <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> them in one of his Declarations, <Q>“”that when, under that notion of Pro∣jectors, they expell'd many, they yet never question'd S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Mild∣may,</HI></Q> or M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Laurence Whitaker;</HI> who had been most scandalously en∣gaged
<PB N="141" REF="1630"/>
in those Pressures, though since more scandalously in all enter∣prizes against his Majesty; to which never any answer or reply was made.</P>
<P>THE next art, was to make the Severity and Rigour of the House as formidable as was possible, and to make as many men apprehend them∣selves obnoxious to the House, as had been in any trust or employ∣ment in the Kingdom. Thus they pass'd many general Votes concern∣ing Ship-money, in which, all who had been High Sheriffs, and so col∣lected it, were highly concern'd. The like sharp Conclusions were made <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> upon all Lords Lievtenants and their Deputies, which were the prime Gentlemen of Quality in all the Counties of <HI>England.</HI> Then upon some disquisition of the Proceedings in the Star-chamber, and at the Coun∣cil-Table, all who concurr'd in such a Sentence, and consented to such an Order, were declared Criminal, and to be proceeded against. So that, in a moment, All the Lords of the Council, All who had been Deputy-Lievtenants, or High Sheriffs, during the late years, found themselves within the mercy of these grand Inquisitors: and hearing new terms of art, that a complication of several Misdemeanours might grow up to Treason, and the like, it was no wonder if men desired by all means <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to get Their favour and protection.</P>
<P>WHEN they had sufficiently startled men by these Proceedings, and upon half an hour's debate, sent up an Accusation against the Lord<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch-Bi∣shop of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI> ac∣cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of High Treason.</NOTE> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> of High Treason, and so removed Him like∣wise from the King's Council, they rested satisfied with their general Rules, Votes, and Orders, without making hast to proceed either against Things or Persons; being willing, rather to keep men in Suspense, and to have the advantage of their Fears, than, by letting them see the Worst that could befall them, lose the benefit of their Application. For this reason they used their utmost skill to keep off any debate of Ship∣money, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that that whole business might hang like a Meteor over the heads of those that were in any degree faulty in it; and it was observable, when, notwithstanding all their endeavours to divert it, that business was brought into debate, and upon that (which could not be avoided) the Lord <HI>Finch</HI> named as an avow'd Factor and Procurer of that odious Judgement; who, if Their rule were true, <Q>“”that an endeavour to alter the Government by Law, and to introduce an Arbitrary Power, were Treason,</Q> was the most notoriously and unexcusably guilty of that crime of any man that could be named; Before they would endure the mention of an accusation of High Treason, they appointed a Committee, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> with great deliberation and solemnity, to bring in a charge Formally prepared (which had not been done in the case of the Lord Arch-Bishop, or the Earl of <HI>Strafford)</HI> and then gave him a day to be heard for himself at the House of Commons Bar, whereby, against all order, he was to take notice of what was handled in the House concerning him∣self; and then finding that, by their own Rules, He would be likewise ac∣cused of High Treason, they continued the Debate so long, that the Lords House was risen, so that the Accusation was not carried up till the next morning; and before that time, the Lord Keeper (being well<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord Keeper <HI>Finch</HI> withdrew be∣yond Sea.</NOTE> inform'd of what had pass'd) had withdrawn himself; and shortly af∣ter <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> went into <HI>Holland:</HI> the Lord <HI>Littleton,</HI> then Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, being made Keeper of the great Seal of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> in his place.</P>
<P>ABOuT the same time, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Francis Windebank,</HI> one of the Principal
<PB N="142" REF="1640"/>
Secretaries of State, and then a Member of the House of Commons, was accused of many transactions on the behalf of the Papists, of several natures (whose extraordinary Patron indeed he was) and he being then present in the House, several Warrants under his own hand were pro∣duced for the discharge of Prosecutions against Priests, and for the release of Priests out of Prison: whereupon, whilst the matter should be de∣bated, according to custom he was order'd to Withdraw, and so went in∣to the usual place, the Committee-Chamber; immediately whereupon, the House of Commons went to a Conference with the Lords upon some other occasion, and returning from that Conference, no more resumed <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the debate of the Secretary, but having consider'd some other business rose at their usual hour; and so the Secretary had liberty to go to his own house; from whence, observing the disposition of the House, and well knowing what they were able to say against him, he had no more<NOTE PLACE="marg">as did like∣wise Secretary <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndebank.</HI></NOTE> mind to trust himself in that company, but the same night withdrew himself from any place where enquiry might be made for him, and was no more heard of till the news came of his being landed in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>SO that within less than six weeks, for no more was yet elapsed, these terrible Reformers had caused the two greatest Counsellors of the Kingdom, and whom they most fear'd, and so hated, to be removed <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> from the King, and imprison'd, under an accusation of High Treason; and frighted away the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> and One of the Principal Secretaries of State, into Forreign Kingdoms, for fear of the like; besides the preparing all the Lords of the Council, and very many of the principal Gentlemen throughout <HI>England,</HI> who, (as was said before) had been High Sherriffs, and Deputy Lievtenants, to expect such measure of Punishment from Their general Votes and Reso∣lutions, as their future Demeanour should draw upon them, for their past Offences: by which means, they were like to find no vigorous Re∣sistance or Opposition in their farther designs. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>I COULD never yet learn the true reason, why they suffer'd Secretary <HI>Windebank</HI> to escape their Justice (for the Lord <HI>Finch,</HI> it was visible he was in their favour, and they would gladly have preserv'd him in the place) against whom they had more pregnant testimony of Offences within the verge of the Law, than against any person they have accused since this Parliament, and of some that, it may be, might have proved Capital, and so their appetite of Blood might have been satisfied: For, besides his frequent Letters of intercession in his Own name, and signi∣fication of his Majesty's Pleasure, on the behalf of Papists and Priests, to the Judges, and to other Ministers of Justice; and Protections granted <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> by Himself to Priests, that nobody should molest them; He harbour'd some Priests in his own House, knowing them to be such; which, by the Statute made in the Twenty ninth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> is made Felony: and there were some Warrants under his Own hand for the release of Priests out of <HI>Newgate,</HI> who were actually attainted of Trea∣son, and condemn'd to be hang'd, drawn, and quarter'd; which by the strict Letter of the Statute, the Lawyers said, would have been very Penal to him.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER one Story brought into the House concerning him, that administred some mirth; A Messenger (I think his name was <HI>New∣ton)</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> who principally attended the service of apprehending Priests, came one day to him in his Garden, and told him, <Q>“”that he had brought with him a Priest, a stirring and active person, whom he had appre∣hended
<PB N="143" REF="1650"/>
that morning; and desired to know, to what Prison he should carry him.</Q> The Secretary sharply ask'd him, <Q>“”Whether he would never give over this Blood-thirsty humour?</Q> and in great anger calling him Knave, and taking the Warrant from him by which he had ap∣prehended him, departed without giving any other direction. The Mes∣senger appall'd, thought the Priest was some person in favour, and therefore took no more care of him, but suffer'd him to depart. The Priest, freed from this fright, went securely to his Lodgings, and within two or three days was arrested for Debt, and carried in execution to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Prison. Shortly after, Secretary <HI>Windebank</HI> sent for the Messenger, and ask'd him, <Q>“”What was become of the Priest he had at such a time brought before him? he told him, "that he conceived his Honour had been offended with the apprehension of him, and therefore he had look'd no farther after him.</Q> The Secretary in much Passion told him, <Q>“”the discharging a Priest was no light matter, and that if he spee∣dily found him not, he should answer the default with his life; that the Priest was a dangerous Fellow, and must not escape in that fa∣shion.</Q> The Messenger, besides his natural inclination to that exercise, terrified with those threats, left no means untried for the discovery, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and at last heard where the man was in execution in Prison: thither he went and demanded the Priest (who was not there known to be such) as his Prisoner formerly, and escaped from him; and by virtue of his first Warrant took him again into his custody, and immediately carried him to the Secretary; and within few days after, the Priest was dis∣charged, and at liberty. The Jaylor, in whose custody he had been put for debt, was arrested by the Parties griev'd, and he again sued the Mes∣senger, who appeal'd for Justice to the House of Commons against the Secretary.</P>
<P>THIS Case had been presented to the Committee, and was ready to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> be reported, with all those Warrants under his own hand before men∣tion'd, at the time when Secretary <HI>Windebank</HI> was in the House. Be∣sides that, he was charged by the Lords, by Message or at a Conference, for Breach of Priviledge at the Dissolution of the last Parliament, and signing Warrants for the searching the Studies and Papers of some Mem∣bers; for which, according to the Doctrine then receiv'd, he might have been put into the custody of the Serjeant of the House. But, as the last occasion was not laid hold of, because it would have inevitably in∣volv'd his brother Secretary S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> who was under the same charge, and against whom indeed That charge was aim'd: So it seems, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> they were contented he should make an escape from any Trial for the rest; either, because they thought his Place would be sooner void by his Flight than by his Trial, which would have taken up some time, and required some formality, they having design'd that Place to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hollis;</HI> or, that they thought he would, upon any examination, draw in some∣what to the Prejudice of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> whom they were to protect: and so they were well content with his Escape.</P>
<P>HAVING made their first entrance upon business with this vigour, they proceeded every day with the same fervour; and he who exprest most Warmth against the Court and the Government, was heard with <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the most Favour; every day producing many form'd elaborate Ora∣tions, against all the Acts of State which had been done for many years preceding. That they might hasten the Prosecution of the Earl of <HI>Straf∣ford,</HI> which was their First great design, they made a close Committee
<PB N="144" REF="1660"/>
of such Members, as they knew to be most for their purpose, who should, under an obligation of Secrecy, prepare the heads of a charge against him; which had been seldom or never heard of before in Par∣liament: and that they might be sure to do their business effectually, they sent a message to the House of Peers, to desire them <Q>“”to nominate a select Committee likewise of a few, to examine upon oath such Wit∣nesses, as the Committee of the House of Commons for preparing the Charge against the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> should produce before them, and in their Presence and upon such Interrogatories as they should offer;</Q> which, though it was without Precedent, or example, the Lords pre∣sently <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> consented to, and named such men as knew well What they had to do▪ Then they caused Petitions to be every day presented, by some who had been Griev'd by any severe Sentences in the Star-Chamber, or Committed by the Lords of the Council; against Lords Lievtenants of Counties, and their Deputy-Lievtenants, for having levyed Money upon the Country, for conducting and clothing of Soldiers, and other actions of a Martial nature (which had been done by those Officers so qualified, from the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and was practised through∣out her Reign) and against Sheriffs, for having levied Ship-money. Upon all which Petitions (the matter being press▪d and aggravated still <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> upon every particular by some Member of note and authority, upon which) all the acts how formal and judicial soever, without so much as hearing the Sentences or Judgements read, were voted <Q>“”to be Ille∣gal, and against the Liberty and Property of the Subject; and that all who were guilty of such Proceedings, should be Prosecuted for their presumption, and should likewise pay Damages to the persons injured.</Q></P>
<P>BY which general Votes (all pass'd within a short time after the sit∣ting of the Parliament) they had made themselves so terrible, that all Privy-Counsellors, as well for what they had done at the Board, as in <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Star-chamber (where indeed many notable Sentences had pass'd, with some excess in the Punishment) all Lords Lievtenants, who for the most part were likewise Counsellors, whereof all were of the House of Peers; and then all who were Deputy-Lievtenants, or had been She∣riffs since the first issuing out of Writs for the collection of Ship-money, whereof very many were then of the House of Commons; found them∣selves involv'd under some of those Votes, and liable to be proceeded against upon the first Provocation; whereby they were kept in such aw, both in the one House, and the other, as if they were upon their good behaviour, that they durst not appear to dislike, much less to oppose <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> whatsoever was proposed.</P>
<P>ALL persons imprison'd for Sedition by the Star-Chamber upon the most solemn examination and the most grave deliberation, were set at liberty, that they might prosecute their appeals in Parliament. In the mean time, though there were two Armies in the bowels of the King∣dom, at so vast an expence, care was taken only to provide money to Pay them, without the least mention that the one should return into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the other be disbanded, that so that vast expence might be determin'd: but on the contrary, frequent insinuations were given, <Q>“”that many great things were first to be done before the Armies could <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> be disbanded;</Q> only they desired the King <Q>“”that all Papists might be forthwith cashier'd out of his Army,</Q> which his Majesty could not deny; and so some Officers of good account were immediately dismiss'd.</P>

<P>THE First, <Q>“”for a Committee to be settled of both Houses for the taking Preparatory Examinations.</Q> Thus the Allegation was, <Q>“”That the Charge against the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was of an extraordinary na∣ture, being to make a Treason evident out of a complication of several <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> ill acts; That he must be traced through many dark paths, and This Precedent seditious Discourse, compared with That Subsequent outra∣gious Action, the Circumstances of both which, might be equally con∣siderable with the Matter it self; and therefore that before this Charge could be so directly made and prepared as was necessary (for he was hitherto only accused generally of Treason) "it was requisite, that a Committee should be made of both Houses to examine some Witnesses upon Oath, upon whose Depositions, his Impeachment would easily be framed.</Q> This was no sooner proposed in the House of Commons, than consented to; and upon as little debate yielded to by the Lords; and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the Committee settled accordingly: without considering that such an Inquisition (besides that the same was contrary to the Practice of former times) would easily prepare a Charge against the most Innocent man alive; where that liberty should be taken to examine a man's whole life; and all the light, and all the private discourses had past from him, might be tortured, perverted, and applied, according to the conscience and the craft of a Diligent and Malicious Prosecution.</P>
<P>THE Second was, <Q>“”for the Examining upon Oath Privy-Counsel∣lors, upon such matters as had pass'd at the Council-Table.</Q> The Alle∣gation for this was, <Q>“”That the principal Ingredient into the Treason <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> with which the Earl was to be charged, was, a purpose to Change the Form of Government; and, instead of That settled by Law, to intro∣duce a Power meerly Arbitrary. Now this design must be made Evi∣dent, as well by the Advices which he gave, and the Expressions he utter'd upon Emergent Occasions, as by his Publick Actions; and Those could not be discover'd, at least not proved, but by Those who were Present at such consultations, and They were only Privy-Coun∣sellors.</Q> As it was alledged, <Q>“”That at his coming from <HI>Ireland</HI> the Earl had said in Council there; That if ever he return'd to that Sword again, he would not leave a <HI>Scotish</HI>-man in that Kingdom: and at his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> arrival in this Kingdom; the Lord Mayor and some Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> attending the Board about the Loan of Moneys, and not giving that Satisfaction was expected, that He should pull a Letter out of his pocket, and shew what course the King of <HI>France</HI> then took for the raising of Money; and that He should tell the King, That it would never be well till he hang'd up a Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> in the City to terrify the rest.</Q></P>
<P>THERE was no greater difficulty to satisfy the House of Commons with the Reasonableness of this, than of the former; but the Compassing it, was not like to be easy: for it was visible, that though the Lords <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> should join with them (which was not to be despair'd) the Privy-Coun∣sellors would insist upon the Oath they had taken, and pretend <Q>“”that without the King's consent they might not discover any thing that had pass'd at that Board; so that the greatest difficulty would be, The pro∣curing
<PB N="154" REF="1760"/>
the King's consent for the betraying Himself: but This must be insisted on, for God forbid that it might be safe for any desperate wic∣ked Counsellor to propose and advise at that Board (which in the intervals of Parliaments wholely disposed the affairs of State) "courses destructive to the health and being of the Kingdom; and that the Sove∣raign Physician, the Parliament (which had the only skill to cure those contagious and epidemical diseases) should be hindred from pre∣serving the Publick, because no Evidence must be given of such cor∣rupt and wicked Counsels.</Q> And so provided with this specious Ora∣tory, they desire the Lords <Q>“”to concur with Them for this necessary <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Examination of Privy-Counsellors;</Q> Who, without much debate (for the Persons concern▪d knew well their Acts were visible and publick enough, and therefore consider'd not much what Words had pass'd) con∣sented; and appointed some to attend the King for His consent: Who, not well weighing the Consequence; and being in Publick Council unani∣mously advised <Q>“”to consent to it: and that the not doing it would lay some taint upon his Council, and be a tacit consession, that there had been agitations at that place which would not endure the light;</Q> Yielded that they should be examin▪d: which was speedily done accordingly, by the Committee of both Houses appointed for that purpose. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THE Damage was not to be express▪d, and the Ruin that last act brought to the King was irreparable; for, besides that it serv'd Their turn ▪which no question they had discover'd before) to prove those words against the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane</HI> so punctually remem∣ber'd (as you shall find at the Earl's Trial) and besides, that it was mat∣ter of horror to the Counsellors, to find that They might be arraign'd for every rash, every inconsiderate, every imperious expression or word they had used There; and so made them more engaged to servile ap∣plications: it banish'd for ever all future freedom from that Board, and those Persons, from whom his Majesty was to expect advice in his greatest <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> streights: all men satisfying themselves, <Q>“”that they were no more obliged to deliver their opinions There freely, when they might be Impeach'd in another place for so doing;</Q> and the evincing this so useful Doctrine, was without doubt more the design of those grand Managers, than any hope they had, of receiving further Information thereby, than they had before.</P>
<P>AND for my part I must ask leave of those Noble Lords, Who af∣ter the King▪s consent gave themselves liberty to be Examin'd, to say; that if they had well consider'd the Oath they had taken when they were admitted to that Society, which was <HI>[To keep Secret all matters com∣mitted <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and reveal▪d to them, or that should be treated of secretly in Council▪</HI> they would not have believ'd, that the King Himself could have dispensed with that Part of their Oath. It is true, there is another clause in their Oath, that allows them with the King's consent to reveal a matter of Council: but that is, Only what shall touch another Counsel∣lor; which they are not to do without the leave of the King, or the Council.</P>
<P>IT was now time to mind Themselves, as well as the Publick, and to Repair, as well as Pull Down; and therefore, as the principal reason (as was said before) for the accusing those Two great Persons of High Trea∣son <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> (that is, of the general Consent to it before any Evidence was re∣quired) was, that they might be removed from the King's Presence and his Counsels, without which they conceiv'd Theirs would have no power
<PB N="155" REF="1770"/>
with him; so That being compass'd, care was taken to infuse into the King by Marquis <HI>Hamilton</HI> (Who you heard before was licensed to take care of Himself; and was now of great intimacy with the Governing and Undertaking Party) <Q>“”that his Majesty having declared to his Peo∣ple, that He really intended a Reformation of all those Extravagancies which former necessities, or occasions, or mistakes, had brought into the Government of Church or State: He could not give a more lively and demonstrable Evidence, and a more gracious Instance of such his intention, than by calling such Persons to his Council, Whom the Peo∣ple <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> generally thought most inclined to, and intent upon, such Refor∣mation: Besides, that this would be a good means to preserve the di∣gnity and just power of that Board, which might otherwise, on the account of the late excess and violation, be more subject to inconve∣nient attempts for the Future.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers new Privy-Coun∣sellors sworn of the Popu∣lar Party.</NOTE> HEREuPON in one day were sworn Privy-Counsellors, much to the publick joy, the Earl of <HI>Hertford</HI> (whom the King afterwards made Marquis) the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> the Lord <HI>Savile,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Kimbolton;</HI> and within two or three days after, the Earl of <HI>Warwick:</HI> being All persons at that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> time very gracious to the People, or to the <HI>Scots,</HI> by whose election and discretion the People chose; and had been All in some umbrage at Court, and Most in visible disfavour there. This act the King did very chear∣fully; heartily inclined to Some of them, as He had reason; and not ap∣prehending any Inconvenience by that act from the Other, whom he thought this light of his grace would Reform, or at least Restrain.</P>
<P>BuT the calling and admitting men to that Board is not a work that can be indifferent: the Reputation, if not the Government of the State depending on it. And though, it may be, there hath been too much Cu∣riosity heretofore used to discover men's humours in particular points, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> before they have receiv'd that Honour; whereas possibly such differences were rather to have been desired than avoided: yet there are certain Opinions, certain Propositions, and general Principles, that Whosoever does not hold, and does not believe, is not, without great danger, to be accepted for a Privy-Counsellor. As, Whosoever is not fix'd to Monar∣chical grounds, the preservation and upholding whereof is the chief End of such a Council: Whosoever doth not believe that in order to that great End, there is a Dignity, a Freedom, a Jurisdiction most essential to be preserv'd In, and To that place; and takes not the Preservation there∣of to heart; ought never to be receiv'd there. What in prudence is to be <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> done towards that End, admits a latitude that honest and wise men may safely and profitably differ in; and those Differences (which I said before there was too much unskilful care to prevent) usually produce great advantages in knowledge and wisdom: but the End it self, that which the Logicians call the <HI>Terminus ad quem,</HI> ought allways to be a <HI>postulatum,</HI> which Whosoever doubts, destroys: and Princes cannot be too strict, too tender, in this consideration, in the constituting the body of their Privy-Council; upon the Prudent doing whereof, much of their Safety; more of their Honour and Reputation (which is the Life it self of Princes) both at home and abroad necessarily depends: and the In∣advertencies <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in this Point, have been, mediately or immediately, the Root and the Spring of most of the Calamities that have ensued.</P>
<P>TWO Reasons have been frequently given by Princes for Oversights, or for Willful Breaches, in this important dispensation of their Favours.
<PB N="156" REF="1780"/>
The first, "that such a man can do no harm; when, God knows, few men have done more harm than Those who have been thought to be able to do least; and there cannot be a greater error than to believe, a man whom we see qualified with too mean parts to do good, to be therefore incapable of doing hurt: there is a supply of Malice, of Pride, of Indu∣stry▪ and even of Folly, in the Weakest, when He sets his heart upon it, that makes a strange progress in Mischief. The Second▪ <Q>“”when Per∣sons of ordinary faculties, either upon importunity, or other collateral respects, have been introduced There, that it is but a place of Ho∣nour,</Q> and a general testimony of the King's affection; and so it hath <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> been, as it were reserv'd, as a preferment for Those, who were fit for no other preferment. As amongst the Jesuits they have a Rule, That they▪ who are unapt for greater Studies, shall study cases of Conscience. By this means the Number hath been increased, which in it self breeds great Inconveniences; since a Less number are fitter both for Counsel and Dispatch, in matters of the greatest moment, that depend upon a quick execution, than a Greater number of men equally honest and wise: and for That, and other reasons of Unaptness and Incompetency, Commit∣tees of dexterous men have been appointed out of the Table to do the business of it; and so men have been no sooner exalted with the Honou∣rable <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> title, and pleased with the obligation of being made Privy-Coun∣sellors, than they have check▪d that delight with discerning that they were not fully trusted; and so have been more incensed with the Re∣proachful distinction At, than obliged with the Honourable admission To that Board, where they do not find all persons equally Members. And by this kind of Resentment, many sad Inconveniences have befallen the King; and Those men, Who have had the honour and misfortune of those secret trusts.</P>
<P>THE truth is, the sinking and near desperate condition of Monar∣chy in this Kingdom can never be buoy'd up, but by a prudent and stea∣dy <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Council attending upon the virtue and vivacity of the King; nor be preserv'd and improved when it is up, but by cherishing and preserving the wisdom, integrity, dignity, and reputation, of that Council: the lustre whereof allways reflects upon the King himself; who is not thought a Great Monarch when he follows only his Own Reason and Ap∣petite; but when, for the informing his Reason, and guiding his Actions, he uses the service, industry, and faculties, of the Wisest men. And though it hath been, and will be, allways necessary to admit to those Counsels some men of great Power, who will not take the pains to im∣prove their great parts▪ yet the Number of the whole should not be too <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> great; and the Capacities and Qualities of the most should be fit for busi∣ness; that is, either for Judgement, and Dispatch; or for One of them at least: and for Integrity above all.</P>
<P>THIS Digression ▪much longer than was intended) will not appear very impertinent, when the great disservice shall appear, which befell the King by the swearing those Lords formerly mention'd (I speak but of some of them) Privy-Counsellors. For instead of exercising them∣selves in their new Province, and endeavouring to preserve and vindi∣cate that Jurisdiction; they look'd upon themselves as preferr'd thither, by their reputation in Parliament, not by the kindness and esteem of the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> King; and so resolv▪d to keep up principally the greatness of that Place, to which they thought they ow'd their Own greatness. And therefore when the King required the Advice of his Privy▪Council, in those mat∣ters
<PB N="157" REF="1790"/>
of the highest importance which were then every day incumbent on Him, the new Privy-Counsellors positively declared, <Q>“”that They might not (that was, that nobody might) give his Majesty any advice in matters depending in the two Houses, which was not agreeable to the sense of the two Houses; which They call'd his Great Council, by Whose wisdom he was entirely to guide himself.</Q> As this doctrine was insipid∣ly and perniciously urged by some; so it was supinely and stupidly sub∣mitted to by others: insomuch as the King, in a moment found him∣self bereav'd of all Publick assistance and advice, in a time when he <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> needed it most; and his greatest, and, upon the matter, his only business, being prudently to weigh and consider What to Consent to, and What to Deny, of such things as should be Proposed to him by the two Houses: He was now told, "that He was only to be Advised by Them; which was as much as to say, that He must do whatsoever They desired of him.</P>
<P>WHEREAS in truth, it is not only Lawful for the Privy-Council, but their Duty, to give faithfully and freely Their advice to the King upon all matters concluded in Parliament, to which his Royal assent is ne∣cessary, as well as upon any other subject whatsoever. Nay a Privy-Counsellor, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> as Such, is bound to disswade the King from consenting to that which is Prejudicial to the Crown; at least to make that Prejudice manifest to him; though as a private person he could wish the matter consented to. And therefore, by the constitution of the Kingdom, and the constant practice of Former times, all Bills after they had pass'd both Houses, were deliver'd by the Clerk of the Parliament to the Clerk of the Crown; and by him brought to the Atturney General; who pre∣sented the same to the king sitting in Council; and having read them, declared what Alterations were made by those Bills to former Laws; and what Benefit or Detriment, in Profit or Jurisdiction, would accrew <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> thereby to the Crown: and then upon a full and free debate by his Coun∣sellors, the King resolv'd accordingly upon such Bills as were to be enacted into Laws; and respited the other that he thought not fit to con∣sent to. As this hath been the known Practice, so the Reason is very vi∣sible; that the Royal Assent being a distinct and essential part towards the making a Law, there should be as much care taken to inform the Understanding and Conscience of the King upon those occasions; as Theirs, who prepare the same for his Royal assent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great licence in Preaching and Printing.</NOTE> THAT it might appear that what was done Within the Houses, was agreeable to those who were Without; and that the same Spirit reign'd <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> in Parliament, and People; all possible licence was exercised in Preach∣ing, and Printing any old Scandalous Pamphlets, and adding New to them against the Church: Petitions presented by many Parishioners against their Pastors, with Articles of their Misdemeanours and Beha∣viours; most whereof consisted, <Q>“”in their Bowing at the name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and obliging the Communicants to come up to the Altar (as they en∣viously call'd it)</Q> that is, to the Rails which enclosed the Communion-Table, "to receive the Sacrament.

<PB N="158" REF="1800"/>

<P>THERE had been Three persons of several Professions some years be∣fore Censured in the Star-chamber, <HI>William Pryn</HI> a Barrester of <HI>Lin∣coln</HI>'s▪Inn, <HI>John Bastwick</HI> a Doctor of Physick, and <HI>Henry Burton</HI> a Mi∣nister and Lecturer of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>THE First, not unlearn▪d in the Profession of the Law, as far as Learning is acquired by the meer reading of Books; but being a person of great Industry, had spent more time in reading Divinity; and which marr'd that Divinity, in the conversation of Factious and Hot-headed Divines: and so, by a mixture of all three, with the rudeness and arro∣gance of his Own nature, had contracted a Proud and Venemous Dislike <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to the discipline of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and so by degrees (as the Progress is very natural) an equal Irreverence to the Government of the State too; both which he vented in several absurd, petulant, and su∣percilious Discourses in Print.</P>
<P>THE Second, a half-witted, crackbrain'd Fellow, unknown to either University, or the College of Physicians; but one that had spent his time abroad, between the Schools and the Camp (for he had been in, or pass'd through Armies) and had gotten a Doctorship, and Latin; with which, in a very flowing style, with some wit and much malice, he In∣veigh'd against the Prelates of the Church in a Book which he printed <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in <HI>Holland,</HI> and industriously dispersed in <HI>London,</HI> and throughout the Kingdom; having presumed (as their Modesty is all ways equal to their Obedience) to Dedicate it <HI>to the Sacred Majesty of the King.</HI></P>
<P>THE Third, had formerly a kind of relation by Service to the King; having, before he took Orders, waited as Closet-keeper, and so attended at Canonical hours with the Books of Devotion upon his Majesty when he was Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> and a little before the death of King <HI>James</HI> took Orders: and so his Highness coming shortly to be King; the va∣pours of Ambition fuming into his head that he was still to keep his Place, he would not think of less than being Clerk of the Closet to the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> new King, which Place his Majesty conferr'd upon, or rather continued in, the Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> Doctor <HI>Neyl,</HI> who had long serv'd King <HI>James</HI> there. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Burton</HI> thus disappointed, and, as He call'd it, despoil'd of his Right, would not, in the greatness of his heart, sit down by the af∣front; but committed two or three such weak, sawcy indiscretions, as caused an Inhibition to be sent him, <Q>“”that he should not presume to come any more to Court:</Q> and from that time he resolv'd to Revenge himself of the Bishop of <HI>Durham,</HI> upon the whole Order; and so turn'd Lecturer and Preach'd against Them; being endued with Malice and Boldness, instead of Learning and any tolerable Parts. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THESE Three persons having been for several follies and libelling humours, first gently Reprehended; and after, for their Incorrigibleness, more severely Censured and Imprison'd; found some means in Prison
<PB N="159" REF="1810"/>
of Correspondence, which was not before known to be between them; and to combine themselves, in a more Pestilent and Seditious Libel than they had ever before vented; in which the Honour of the King, Queen, Counsellors, and Bishops, was with equal licence blasted and traduced; which was faithfully dispersed by their Proselytes in the City. The Authors were quickly and easily known, and had indeed too much inge∣nuity to deny it; and were thereupon brought together to the Star∣chamber <HI>ore tenus;</HI> where they behaved themselves with marvellous In∣solence; with full confidence demanding <Q>“”that the Bishops who sate <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> in the Court (being only the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the Bi∣shop of <HI>London)</HI></Q> <Q>“”might not be present, because they were their Ene∣mies, and so Parties:</Q> which, how scandalous and ridiculous soever it seem'd then There; was good Logick and good Law two years after in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and serv'd to banish the Bishops of that Kingdom both from the Council-Table and the Assembly. Upon a very patient and solemn Hearing, in as full a Court as ever I saw in that place, without any dif∣ference in opinion or dissenting voice, they were all Three censured as Scandalous, Seditious, and Infamous persons, <Q>“”to lose their Ears in the Pillory, and to be imprison'd in several Jayls during the King's <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> pleasure:</Q> all which was executed with Rigour and Severity enough. But yet their itch of Libelling still broke out; and their Friends of the City found a line of Communication with them. Hereupon the Wis∣dom of the State thought fit, that those Infectious Sores should breath out their Corruption in some Air more remote from that catching City, and less liable to the contagion: and so, by an Order of the Lords of the Council, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pryn</HI> was sent to a Castle in the Island of <HI>Jersey;</HI> D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bastwick</HI> to <HI>Silley;</HI> and M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Burton</HI> to <HI>Guernsey;</HI> where they remain'd un∣consider'd, and truly I think unpitied (for they were men of no virtue or merit) for the space of Two years, till the beginning of this pre∣sent <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Parliament.</P>
<P>SHORTLY upon that, Petitions were presented by their Wives or Friends, to the House of Commons, expressing <Q>“”their heavy Censures and long sufferings; and desiring, by way of Appeal, "that the justice and rigour of that Sentence might be review'd and consider'd; and that their Persons might be brought from those remote and desolate places to <HI>London,</HI> that so they might be able to facilitate or attend their own business.</Q> The sending for them out of Prison (which was the main) took up much consideration: for though very Many who had no kind∣ness, had yet compassion for the men; thinking they had suffer'd enough; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and that though they were scurvy Fellows, they had been scurvily used: and Others, had not only affection to their Persons as having suf∣fer'd for a Common cause; but were concern'd to revive and improve their useful faculties of Libelling and reviling Authority; and to make those ebullitions of their malice not thought noisom to the State: Yet a Sentence of a supreme Court, the Star-chamber (of which they had not Yet spoke with Irreverence) was not lightly to be blown off: but, when they were inform'd, and had consider'd, that by that Sentence the Pe∣titioners were condemn'd to some Prisons in <HI>London;</HI> and were after∣ward removed thence by an Order of the Lords of the Council; they <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> look'd upon that Order as a violation of the Sentence: and so made no scruple to order <Q>“”that the Prisoners should be removed from those for∣reign Prisons,</Q> to the Places to which they were regularly first commit∣ted. And to that purpose, Warrants were sign'd by the Speaker, to the
<PB N="160" REF="1820"/>
Governours and Captains of the several Castles, <Q>“”to bring them in safe custody to <HI>London:</HI></Q> which were sent with all possible expedition.</P>
<P>PRYN and <HI>Burton</HI> being Neighbours (though in distinct Islands) landed at the same time at <HI>Southampton;</HI> where they were receiv'd and entertain'd with extraordinary demonstrations of Affection and Esteem; attended by a marvellous conflux of Company; and their Charges not only born with great magnificence, but liberal Presents given to them. And this method and ceremony kept them company all their journey, great herds of People meeting them at their entrance into all Towns, and waiting upon them out with wonderful acclamations of joy. When <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> they came near <HI>London,</HI> multitudes of People of several conditions, some on Horseback, others on Foot, met them some miles from the Town; very many having been a days journey: and they were brought, about two of the Clock in the afternoon, in at <HI>Charing-cross,</HI> and carried into the City by above ten thousand persons, with Boughs and Flow∣ers in their hands; the Common People strewing Flowers and Herbs in the ways as they pass'd, making great noise, and expressions of joy for their Deliverance and Return; and in those acclamations, mingling loud and virulent exclamations against the Bishops, <Q>“”who had so cruel∣ly prosecuted such Godly men.</Q> In the same manner, within five or six <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> days after, and in like Triumph, D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bastwick</HI> return'd from <HI>Silley;</HI> land∣ing at <HI>Dover:</HI> and from thence bringing the same testimonies of the Affections and Zeal of <HI>Kent,</HI> as the others had done from <HI>Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Surrey,</HI> was met before he came to <HI>Southwark</HI> by the good People of <HI>London,</HI> and so conducted to his lodging likewise in the City.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not have wasted thus much time in a discourse of this nature, but that it Is, and was Then evident, that this Insurrection (for it was no better) and Frenzy of the People, was an effect of great Indu∣stry and Policy, to try and publish the Temper of the People; and to sa∣tisfy Themselves, in the activity and interest of their Tribunes, to whom <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that province of Shewing them was committed. And from this time, the licence of Preaching and Printing increased; to that degree, that all Pulpits were freely deliver'd to the Schismatical and Silenced Preach∣ers, who till then had lurk'd in corners, or liv'd in <HI>New-England;</HI> and the Presses at liberty for the publishing the most Invective, Seditious, and Scurrilous Pamphlets, that their Wit and Malice could invent. Whilst the Ministers of the State, and Judges of the Law, like men in an Extasy, surprized and amazed with several Apparitions, had no Speech or Motion; as if, having committed such an Excess of Jurisdiction (as men upon great Surfeits are enjoin'd for a time to eat nothing) they had <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> been prescribed to exercise no Jurisdiction at all. Whereas, without doubt, if either the Privy-Council, or the Judges and the King's learned Council, had assumed the courage to have Question'd the Preaching, or the Printing, or the Seditious Riots upon the Triumph of those three Scandalous men, before the uninterruption and security had confirm'd the People in all three; it had been no hard matter to have destroy'd those Seeds, and pull'd up those Plants, which being neglected, grew up and prosper'd to a full Harvest of Rebellion and Treason. But this was yet but a rudeness and rankness Abroad, without any visible countenance or approbation from the Parliament: all seem'd Chast within those Walls. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THE first Malignity that was apparent There (for the Accusation of the Arch-Bishop and the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> were look'd upon as acts of Passion, directed against particular Persons, who were thought to have

deserv'd some extraordinary measures and proceeding) was against the Church: First, in their Committee for Religion; which had been assumed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the latter times of King <HI>James,</HI> though seldom or never any such thing had Before been heard of in Parliament; where, under pre∣tence of receiving Petitions against Clergy-men, they often debated Points, beyond the verge of Their understanding: Then, by their chear∣ful<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Declaration of some Mini∣sters, and a Petition of some Citizens, against the Government of the Church by Bishops.</NOTE> reception of a Declaration of many Sheets of Paper, against the whole Government of the Church; presented by ten or a dozen Mini∣sters, at the Bar; and pretended to be sign'd, by several Hundreds of the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Ministers of <HI>London</HI> and the Countries adjacent: and a Petition, pre∣sented by Alderman <HI>Pennington,</HI> and alledged to be subscribed by Twen∣ty Thousand men, Inhabitants within the City of <HI>London;</HI> who re∣quired, in plain terms, "the total Extirpation of Episcopacy. Yet the House was Then so far from being possess'd with that Spirit, that the ut∣most that could be obtain'd, upon a long debate upon that Petition, was, "that it should not be rejected; against which the Number of the Pe∣titioners, was urged as a powerfull Argument; only it was suffer'd to remain in the hands of the Clerk of the House, with direction, <Q>“”that no Copy of it should be given.</Q> And for the Ministers Declaration, one <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Part only of it, was Insisted on by them, and Read in the House; which concern'd the exercise of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and the Excess of Their Courts: the other parts were Declined by Many of them, and e∣specially Order'd, <Q>“”to be Seal'd up by the Clerk, that they might be perused by no man.</Q> So that all that Envy and Animosity against the Church, seem'd to be resolv'd into a desire, <Q>“”that a Bill might be framed to Remove the Bishops from their Votes in the Lords House, and from any Office in Secular affairs,</Q> which was the utmost men pretended to wish: and to such a purpose, a Bill was shortly after prepared, and brought into the House; of which, more shall be said in its proper <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Disin∣genuity used in procuring Pe∣titions.</NOTE> IT was a strange Disingenuity, that was practised in the Procuring those Petitions; which continued ever after, in the like Addresses. The course was, First to prepare a Petition very modest and dutiful, for the Form; and for the Matter, not very unreasonable; and to communicate it at some Publick Meeting, where care was taken it should be received with Approbation: the Subscription of very Few hands fill'd the Paper it self, where the Petition was written, and therefore many more Sheets were annex'd, for the reception of the Number, which gave all the credit, and procured all the countenance to the Undertaking. When a <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Multitude of Hands was procured, the Petition it Self was cut off; and a New One framed, suitable to the design in hand, and annex'd to the long List of Names which were Subscribed to the Former. By this means, Many men found Their hands Subscribed to petitions, of which, They before had never heard. As several Ministers, whose Hands were to the Petition and Declaration of the <HI>London</HI> Ministers before men∣tion'd, have profess'd to many Persons, <Q>“”that They never saw That Pe∣tition or Declaration before it was presented to the House; but had sign'd Another, the Substance of which was, Not to be Compell'd to take the Oath enjoin'd by the New Canons:</Q> and when they found, in∣stead <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of That, their Names set to a desire of an Alteration of the Government of the Church, <Q>They with much trouble went to M<SUP>r</SUP> “”<HI>Marshall,</HI> with whom they had intrusted the Petition and their Hands; who gave them no other Answer, but that it was thought fit by Those
<PB N="162" REF="1840"/>
who understood Business better than They, that the Latter Petition should rather be preferr'd than the Former.</Q> And when He found, they intended by some publick act to Vindicate themselves from that Ca∣lumny: Such persons, upon Whom they had their greatest dependence, were engaged, by threats and promises to prevail with them, to Sit still, and to pass by that Indirect proceeding</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaints a∣gainst <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> particular B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣shops</NOTE> FOR the better facilitating and making way for those virulent at∣tempts upon the Church, Petitions and Complaints were exhibited a∣gainst the Exorbitant Acts of some Bishops; especially against the Bishops of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> and <HI>Ely;</HI> who, they alledged, <Q>“”had with great Pride <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and Insolence, provoked All the Gentry, and Most of the Inhabitants<NOTE PLACE="marg">And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the New <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</NOTE> within their Diocesses.</Q> And the New Canons were insisted on, <Q>“”as a most palpable Invasion by the Whole Body of the Clergy, upon the Laws and Liberty of the People.</Q></P>
<P>I SAID before, that after the Dissolution of the former Short Par∣liament, the Convocation was continued by special Warrant from the King; and by his Majesty, in a solemn message sent to them by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Har∣ry Vane</HI> then Principal Secretary, <Q>“”required to proceed in the making of Canons,</Q> for the better Peace and Quiet of the Church. Notwith∣standing this Command, the Chief of the Clergy, well knowing the Spi∣rit <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of Bitterness that was contracted against them; and many obsolete Pamphlets against their Jurisdiction and Power, being, since the Com∣motions in <HI>Scotland,</HI> revived and publish'd with more freedom; desired his Majesty, <Q>“”that the Opinions of the Judges might be known and declared, Whether They might then Lawfully Sit, the Parliament be∣ing Dissolv'd, and proceed in the making of Canons; as likewise, upon other Particulars in Their Jurisdiction, which had been most Inveigh'd against?</Q></P>
<P>ALL the Judges of <HI>England,</HI> upon mature debate, in the presence of the King's Council, under their Hands asserted, <Q>“”the Power of the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Convocation in making Canons, and those other parts of Jurisdiction, which had been so Enviously question'd.</Q> Hercupon, They proceeded; and having composed a Body of Canons, presented the same to his Majesty, for his Royal Approbation. They were then again debated at the Council-Board; not without notable Opposition: for upon some les∣sening the Power and Authority of their Chancellors, and their Com∣missaries▪ by those Canons, the Professors of that Law took themselves to be Disobliged; and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Martin</HI> (who was not likely to over∣see any advantages) upon several days of Hearing at the Council-Table, with his utmost skill Objected against them: but in the end, by the en∣tire <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and unanimous Advice of the Privy-Council, the Canons were Con∣firm'd by the King, under the Great Seal of <HI>England;</HI> and thereby en∣join'd to be observ'd. So that whatsoever they were, the Judges were at least as Guilty of the First Presumption in Framing them; and the Lords of the Council, in Publishing and Executing them; as the Bishops, or the rest of the Clergy, in Either.</P>
<P>YET the Storm fell wholely on the Church: and the Matter of those Canons, and the Manner of making them, was insisted on, as a pregnant testimony of a Malignant Spirit in the very Function of the Bishops. The truth is, the season in which that Synod continued to Sit <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> (as was observ'd before) was in so Ill a Conjuncture of time (upon the Dissolution of a Parliament, and allmost in an Invasion from <HI>Scotland)</HI> that nothing could have been transacted There, of a Popular and Pre∣vailing
<PB N="163" REF="1850"/>
influence. And then, some sharp Canons against Sectaries; and some Additionals in point of Ceremonies, countenancing, though not enjoining what had not been long practised; infinitely inflamed Some, and troubled Others: Who jointly took advantage of what strictly was amiss; as the making an Oath, the Matter of which was conceiv'd In∣congruous; and enjoining it to many of the Laity, as well as the Clergy; and likewise the Granting of Subsidies.</P>
<P>So that the House of Commons (that is, the major part) made no<NOTE PLACE="marg">which are condemn'd by the House of Commons.</NOTE> scruple, in that Heat, to declare, <Q>“”that the Convocation-House had no <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Power at all of making Canons:</Q> notwithstanding that it was apparent by the Law, and the uncontradicted Practice of the Church, that Ca∣nons had never been otherwise made: <Q>“”and that those Canons contain▪d in them, matter of Sedition and Reproach to the Regal Power; pre∣judicial to the Liberty and Property of the Subject; and to the Privi∣ledges of Parliament.</Q> By the extent of which notable Vote and De∣claration, they had involv'd allmost the whole Clergy under the guilt of Arbitrary Proceedings; as much as they had done the Nobility and Gentry before, under their Votes against Lords Lievtenants, Deputy Lievtenants, Privy▪Counsellors, and Sheriffs; and of which they made <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the same use: as shall be remembred in its proper place.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, the two Armies were necessarily to be provided<NOTE PLACE="marg">Money bor∣row'd of the City by the two Houses, for supplying the two Ar∣mies.</NOTE> for, lest the Countries where their Quarters were, should come to be oppress'd by free quarter; which would not only raise a very inconve∣nient noise, but introduce a necessity of disbanding the Armies, which They were in no degree ready for: and Money not being to be raised soon enough in the regular way, by Act of Parliament, which would re∣quire some time in the passing; besides, that the Manner and Way of raising it had not been enough consider'd; and the Collecting it would require much time, even after an Act of Parliament should be pass'd: <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Therefore, for the present supply, it was thought fit to make use of Their Credit with the City; to Whom a formal Embassy of Lords and Commons was sent; which were carefully chosen of Such Persons as carried the business of the House before them, that the performing the Service, might be as well imputed to Their particular reputation and in∣terest, as to the affection of the City: and these men in their Orations to the Citizens, undertook <Q>“”that their Money should be repaid with In∣terest by the Care of the Parliament.</Q> And This was the First Intro∣duction of the Publick Faith; which grew afterwards to be applied to all Monstrous purposes.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> THIS Expedient succeeded twice or thrice for such Sums as They thought fit to require; which were only enough to carry on their affairs, and keep them in motion; not proportionable to discharge the Debt due to the Armies, but to enable them to Pay their Quarters: it being fit to keep a considerable Debt still owing, lest they should appear too ready to be disbanded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A now Com∣mon▪Council of the Party chosen.</NOTE> THEY had likewise another Design in this Commerce with the City; Which, allways upon the loan of Money, used to recommend some such thing to the Parliament, as might advance the Designs of the Party; <Q>as “”the Proceeding against Delinquents;</Q> or <Q>“”some Reformation in the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Church:</Q> which the Managers knew well what Use to make of upon any emergency. When They had set this Traffick on foot in the City, and so brought their Friends There into more reputation and activity; Then, at Their Election for Common-Council men (which is every year
<PB N="164" REF="1860"/>
before <HI>Christmas;</HI> and in which, New men had rarely used to be chosen, except in case of Death, but the Old still continued) all the grave and substantial Citizens were left out; and Such chosen, as were most emi∣nent for opposing the Government, and most disaffected to the Church, though of never so mean Estates: which made a present, visible altera∣tion, in the Temper of the City (the Common▪Council having so great a share in the management of affairs There) and even in the Govern∣ment it self.</P>
<P>OTHER Ways were now to be thought of for getting of Money, which was, once at least every Month, call'd for very importunately by <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners; which caused the same provision to be made for the <HI>English</HI> Forces. The next Expedient was, <Q>“”That in so great an Exigence, and for the Publick Peace; that the Armies might not enter into Blood, by the determination of the Cessation, which want of Pay would inevitably produce; The several Members of the House would lend Money, according to their several abilities; or that Such as had no Money, would become Bound for it: and upon these terms enough could be borrow▪d.</Q> This was no sooner Proposed, but Con∣sented to, by all the eminent Leaders; and by many Others, in order to make themselves the more acceptable to Those; and some did it for <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Their Own convenience, there being little hazard of their Money, and full Interest to be receiv▪d, and believing it would facilitate the Dis∣banding of the Armies; to Which, all Sober men's hearts were di∣rected.</P>
<P>AND now, to support Their stock of Credit, it was time to raise Money upon the People by Act of Parliament; which they had an Ex∣cuse for not doing in the usual way, <Q>“”of giving it immediately to the King, to be paid into the Exchequer; because the Publick Faith was so deeply engaged to the City for a great Debt; and so Many parti∣cular Members in the Loan of Moneys, and in being Bound for the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Payment of great Sums, for which their Estates were liable: and Therefore it was but reason, that for Their Indemnity, the Money that was to be raised, should be paid into the hands of Particular Mem∣bers of the House, named by Them; who should take care to Di∣scharge<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>es▪ the House of Com∣mons naming Commissioners to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Money</NOTE> all Publick Engagements.</Q> The first Bill they pass▪d being but for two Subsidies, which was not sufficient to discharge any considerable part of the money borrow'd, They inserted in the Bill the Commis∣sioners Names, who were to Receive and Dispose the money. And the King made no pause in the Passing it: Himself not considering the Con∣sequence of it; and None about him having the courage to Represent it <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The same me∣thod after∣wards conti∣nued</NOTE> FROM that time, there was no Bill pass'd for the raising of Money, but it was disposed of in the same, or the like manner; that none of it could be applied to the King's use, or by His direction. And They like∣wise took notice, <Q>“”that from the time of his Majesty's coming to the Crown, He had taken the Customs and Impositions upon Merchandize as his Own Right, without any Act of Parliament; which, They said, no King had ever before done;</Q> insinuating withal, <Q>“”that They meant to make a further Enquiry into Those, who had been the chief Mi∣nisters in that Presumption.</Q> They said, <Q>“”Nobody could imagine, but <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that They intended to grant the Same to his Majesty, in the same man∣ner, for His Life, as had been done to his Progenitors by former Parliaments: But, that they found such an Act could not be Presently
<PB N="165" REF="1870"/>
made ready: because the Book of Rates now in practice (besides that it had not been made by Lawful Authority) contain'd many Exces∣ses, and must be Reform'd in several particulars; in preparing which, they would use all possible diligence, and hoped to effect it in a short time: however, that the continuance of the Collection in the manner it was in, without any Lawful Title, and during the very Sitting of the Parliament, would be a Precedent of a very Ill consequence, and make the Right of giving it the more Question'd; at least the less Valued. And therefore it would be fit, that either all the present Col∣lection <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> should be discontinued, and cease absolutely; which was in the power of the Merchants themselves to do, by refusing to pay any Du∣ties which there was no Law to compel them to: or, that a short Act should be presently pass'd, for the continuance of those Payments for a short time; against the expiration whereof, the Act for granting them for Life,</Q> with the Book of Rates, would be prepared, and ready. There were many Inconveniences discover'd in the First, in disconti∣nuing the Collection and Payment of Duties, <Q>“”which would not be so easily revived again, and reduced into order: and that the Last would without prejudice to Either, both vindicate the Right of the Subject, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and secure the King▪s Profit:</Q> and so they prepared (with all the ex∣pressions of Duty and Affection to the King that can be imagin'd) and presented a Grant of those Duties for some few Months. In which there was a preamble, <Q>“”disapproving and condemning All that had been done in That particular, from his Majesty's first coming to the Crown, to that time; and asserting His whole Right to those Payments, to depend upon the Gift of his Subjects:</Q> and concluded with <Q>“”most severe Pe∣nalties to be inflicted upon Those, who should presume hereafter to Collect or Receive them otherwise, than as they were, or should be, granted by Act of Parliament:</Q> which had never been in any other Act <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of Parliament declared: which the King likewise pass'd. So all the Re∣venue He had to live upon, and to provide him meat, and which he had reason to expect should have been more certainly continued to him, was taken into Their Hands; in order to take it from Him too, whenever they should think it convenient to their other designs: of which, he shortly after found the mischief.</P>
<P>THOUGH, as hath been observ'd, there was not hitherto one Penny of money given to the King, or receiv'd by His Ministers; yet, be∣cause Subsidies were raised upon the People, according to the Formality of Parliaments; and as if all that great Supply had been to the King's <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> own Coffers; It was thought necessary, that the People should be re∣fresh'd with some behooveful Law, at the same time that they found themselves charged with the payment of so many Subsidies. And under that consideration, together with the Bill for Subsidies, Another was sent up to the Lords, for a Triennial Parliament: Both which, quickly pass'd that House, and were transmitted to the King.</P>
<P>IN that for the Triennial Parliament (though the same was grounded<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill for a Triennial Par∣liament pass'd.</NOTE> upon Two former Statutes in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, "That there should be Once every Year a Parliament) there were some clauses very derogatory to Monarchical Principles; as <Q>“”giving the Peo∣ple <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Authority to assemble together,</Q> if the King fail'd to call them; and the like: Yet his Majesty, really intending to make those Conven∣tions frequent, without any great hesitation, enacted those two Bills together; so much to the seeming Joy and Satisfaction of Both Houses,
<PB N="166" REF="1880"/>
that they pretended <Q>“”to have sufficiently provided for the Security of the Common wealth; and that there remain'd nothing to be done, but such a return of Duty and Gratitude to the King, as might Testify their Devotions;</Q> and that their only End was to make Him glorious: But those Fits of Zeal and Loyalty, never lasted long.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Edward Littleton</HI> made Lord Keeper</NOTE> THE Lord <HI>Finch</HI>'s flight, made not only the Place of Keeper vacant, but begot several other Vacancies.

<P>BANKS, the Atturney General, was weary enough of the Inquisi∣tion that was made into the Kings Grants, and glad to be promoted to the Common Pleas. <HI>Herbert,</HI> the Sollicitor General, who had sate all this time in the House of Commons, aw'd and terrify'd with their Temper; applying himself to M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Hambden,</HI> and two or three of the Other, with∣out interposing or crossing them in any thing; long'd infinitely to be <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> out of that Fire: and so the Office of Atturney General, which at any other time had been to be wish'd, was now the more grateful, as it removed him from the other attendance: it not being usual in those times for the Atturney General to be a Member of the House of Com∣mons: and he was call▪d by Writ to attend the House of Peers, where he Sits upon the Wooll-Sack at the back of the Judges.</P>
<P>FROM the time that there was no more Fear of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> nor the Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> nor of any particular men who were like to succeed Them in Favour; All who had been active in the Court, or in any Service for the King, being totally dispi∣rited, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and Most of them to be disposed to any Ill Offices against him; The great Patriots thought they might be able to do their Country bet∣ter Service, if they got the Places and Preferments of the Court for Themselves, and so prevent the Evil Counsels which had used to spring from thence. For which purpose, They had then a fast Friend there, the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton;</HI> Who could most dextrously put such an affair into agitation, with the least noise, and prepare both King and Queen to hearken to it very willingly: and in a short time all particulars were well adjusted for every man's accommodation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Offices design'd for some Heads of the Party.</NOTE> THE Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> was to be Treasurer: in order to which, the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Bishop of <HI>London</HI> had already desired the King <Q>“”to receive the Staff in∣to His hand, and give him leave to retire to the sole care of his Bi∣shoprick;</Q> by which, he wisely withdrew from the Storm, and enjoy'd the greatest Tranquillity of any man of the Three Kingdoms, through∣out the whole Boisterous and Destroying Time that follow'd; and liv'd to see a Happy and Blessed End of them, and died in great Honour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bishop of <HI>London</HI> re∣signing the Staff, the Treasury is put into Com∣mission.</NOTE> And so the Treasury was for the present put into Commission.

These Two were engaged to procure the King's Revenue <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to be liberally provided for, and honourably increased and settled.</P>
<P>AND that this might be the better done, the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> pre∣vail'd with the King, upon the Removes mentioned before, to make

<HI>Oliver Saint-John</HI> (who hath been often, and will be oftner mention'd in<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saint-John</HI> made Sollici∣tor General.</NOTE> this Discourse) his Sollicitor General; which his Majesty readily con∣sented to: hoping, that being a Gentleman of an Honourable Extraction (if he had been Legitimate) he would have been very useful in the pre∣sent exigence to support His Service in the House of Commons, where his Authority was then great; at least, that he would be ashamed ever to appear in any thing that might prove prejudicial to the Crown. And he became immediately possess'd of that Office of great trust; and was so well qualified for it, at that time, by his fast and rooted malignity a∣gainst <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Government, that he lost no credit with his Party, out of any apprehension or jealousy that he would change his Side: and he made good their confidence; not in the least degree abating his malignant Spirit, or dissembling it; but with the same obstinacy, opposed every thing which might advance the King's Service, when he was his Sollici∣tor, as ever he had done before.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Say</HI> was to be Master of the Wards; which Place the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> was likewise to surrender for his own quiet and secu∣rity. And <HI>Denzil Hollis</HI> was to be Secretary of State, in the place of Secretary <HI>Windebank.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> THUS far the Intrigue for Preferments was entirely complied with: and it is great pity that it was not fully executed, that the King might have had Some able men to have advised or assisted him; which pro∣bably These very men would have done, after they had been so through∣ly engaged: whereas, the King had None left about him in any Imme∣diate Trust in business (for I speak not of the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and some very Few men more about his Person, who allways behaved themselves Honourably) who either did not Betray, or Sink under the Weight or Reproach of it.</P>
<P>BuT the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> was resolv'd, that he would not enter into <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Treasury, till the Revenue was in some degree settled; at least, the Bill for Tonnage and Poundage pass'd, with all decent circumstances, and for Life; which both He and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> did very heartily labour to effect; and had in Their thoughts, Many good Expedients, by which they intended to raise the Revenue of the Crown. And none of them were very sollicitous to take their Promotions, before some other Ac∣commodations were provided for some of the rest of their chief Compa∣nions: who would be neither well pleased with Their so hasty advance∣ment before them, nor so Submissive in the future to follow their dictates.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> HAMBDEN was a man they could not leave unprovided for; and therefore there were several Designs, and very far driven, for the Satis∣faction and Promotion of Him; and <HI>Essex,</HI> and <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and Others; though not so fully concluded, as Those before mention'd. For the King's great End was, by these Compliances, to save the Life of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and to preserve the Church from Ruin: for Nobody thought the Arch-Bishop in danger of His life. And there were Few of the Per∣sons mention'd before, who thought their Preferments would do them much good, if the Earl were suffer'd to live; but in that of the Church, the Major Part even of Those Persons would have been willing to have <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Satisfied the King: the rather, because they had no reason to think the Two Houses, or indeed Either of them, could have been induced to have pursued the contrary.

Most of them in their Private Discourse said, <Q>“”that there was Money enough to be Lent, if men saw there would be like to be an End of Borrow∣ing; but that it was an universal Discomfort and Discouragement, to all men of Estates and Discretion, to see Two great Armies still kept on foot in the Kingdom, at so vast a Charge, when there remain'd no fear of a War; and that if a time were once appointed for the Dis∣banding <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> them, there should not want Money for the doing all that should be necessary in order to it.</Q> This Answer satisfied Them in all respects: and the next day, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> reported the Success of their Em∣ployment; <Q>“”that they had conferr'd with most of the Substantial, and Best Reputed men of the City; Who, by Themselves and their Friends, had promised to supply the Money which was desired.</Q> And then He enlarged upon <Q>“”the Temper they understood the City to be in, by the reports of Those who might be reasonably supposed to know it best; That It was indeed very much troubled aud disheartned, to see two Armies kept on foot at so vast a Charge within the bowells of the King∣dom, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> when God be thank'd all the danger of a War was removed; and that They who were very able to make good what they promised, had frankly undertaken, That if a peremptory day was appointed for
<PB N="169" REF="1910"/>
being rid of those Armies, there should not be want of Money to dis∣charge them.</Q></P>
<P>THE Report was receiv'd with great Applause by the Major part of the House; as was reasonably collected by their Countenance: but it was as apparent, that the Governing Party was exceedingly Perplex'd with it, and knew not on a suddain What to say to it: If they Embraced the opportunity, to procure a supply of Money which was really wanted, it would be too great a Countenance to the Persons who had procured it; whose Reputation they were willing to Depress: Besides, it would im∣ply <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Their Approbation of what had been said of the Disbanding; at least, would be a ground of often mentioning and pressing it; and which, how grateful soever to Most other men, was the thing They most ab∣hor'd. After a long Silence, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden</HI> said, <Q>“”that the worthy Gen∣tlemen were to be much Commended for the Pains they had taken; of which, He doubted not, good Use would be made: and so proposed, That it might be well thought of, and the debate resumed the next day;</Q> which could not be denied. The next day, Alderman <HI>Penning∣ton</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">but discou∣raged and de∣feated by the Party.</NOTE> (a man in highest confidence with the Party; and one, who insi∣nuated all things to the Common-Council which he was directed should <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> be started There) begun the discourse; and said, <Q>“”that the Gentlemen who had been last in the City to borrow Money, had made a fair Re∣port, but that in the End of it, there was <HI>Colloquintida:</HI> that He could not find with what Persons They had conferr'd about the Tem∣per of the City; nor that any Considerable people troubled themselves with Designing or Wishing what the Parliament should do, which they knew to be Wise enough, to know What and When they were to do that which was Best for the Kingdom; and they acquiesced in Their grave Judgment:</Q> and concluded, <Q>“”that the Money that the House stood in need of, or a greater Sum, was ready to be paid to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> whomsoever They should appoint to receive it.</Q> The House made it¦self very Merry with the Alderman's <HI>Colloquintida,</HI> and call'd upon him "to Explain it; and so the Debate ended: all Sober men being well Pleased to see the Disorder they were in, and the Pains they had taken to Free Themselves from it; which every day was renew'd upon them, as the subject matter afforded occasion; and they visibly lost much of the Reverence, which had been formerly paid them.</P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> they begun to make Preparations<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Committee from <HI>Ireland,</HI> in order to the Prosecution of the Earl of <HI>Strafford.</HI></NOTE> for the Trial of the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> who had then been about Three Months in Prison, under the accusation of High Treason: and by this <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> time, for the better supply in this Work, a Committee was come from the Parliament in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to sollicite Matters concerning that King∣dom. This Committee (most of them being Papists, and the Principal Actors since in the Rebellion) was receiv'd with great kindness; and, upon the matter, added to the Committee for the Prosecution of the Earl of <HI>Strafford.</HI> So that now, <HI>Ireland</HI> seem'd no less intent upon the Ruin of that unfortunate Lord, than <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> there being such a Correspondence settled, between <HI>Westminster</HI> and <HI>Dublin,</HI> that Whatsoever was practised in the House of Commons Here, was soon af∣ter done likewise There: and, as S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>George Ratcliff</HI> was accused Here <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of High Treason, upon pretence of being a Confederate with the Earl in his Treasons; but intruth that he might not be capable of giving any Evidence on the Behalf of him, and Thereupon sent for into this King∣dom: So All, or Most of the other Persons, who were in any Trust
<PB N="170" REF="1920"/>
with the Earl, and so Privy to the Grounds and Reasons of the Counsels There▪ and only able to make Those apparent, were accused by the House of Commons in that Kingdom of High Treason; under the gene∣ral Impeachment, of <Q>“”endeavouring to subvert the Fundamental Laws of that Kingdom,</Q> and to introduce an Arbitrary Power: which serv'd the turn There, to Secure their Persons, and to Remove them from Coun∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t had done Here.</P>
<P>WHAT Seeds were then sown for the Rebellion, which within a year after broke out in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the great Liberty and Favour that Com∣mittee found; who, for the good Service against that Lord, were <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> hearkned to in all things that concern'd that Kingdom; shall be observ'd, and spoken of at large, hereafter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> MuCH time was spent in consideration of the Manner of the Trial; for they could find no Precedent would fit their case: <Q>“”Whether it should be in the House of Peers? which Room was thought too little, for the Accusers, Witnesses, Judges, and Spectators: Who should Pro∣secute? Whether Members chosen of the Commons, or the King's Council?</Q> Whether the Bishops (which were Twenty four in number, and like to be too tender-hearted in matter of Blood, and so either to Convert many, or increase a Dissenting Party too much) <Q>“”should have <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Voices in the Trial? Whether those who had been created Peers since the Accusation was carried up,</Q> should be admitted to be Judges? And lastly, <Q>“”Whether the Commoners who were to be present at the Trial, should sit Uncover'd? and, Whether any Members of the House of Commons should be Examin'd at the Trial on the behalf of the Earl? who had sent a List of Names, and desired an Order to that purpose.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER much debate it was agreed, <Q>“”that the Trial should be in <HI>Westminster</HI>-Hall, where Seats should be built for the reception of the whole House of Commons, which together with the Speaker should <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> be present:</Q> for they Then foresaw, that they might be put to another kind of Proceeding than That they pretended; and (though with much ado) they consented to sit uncover'd, lest such a little circumstance might disturb the whole design.</P>
<P>FOR the Prosecution, they had no mind to trust the King's Coun∣cil; who neither knew their Secret Evidence, nor, being inform'd, were like to apply and press it, so vigorously as the business would require: and therefore, they appointed <Q>“”that Committee which had prepared the Charge, to give in the Evidence, and in the name of all the Com∣mons of <HI>England,</HI> to Prosecute the Impeachment.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>FOR the Bishops: after many bitter Invectives; and remembring the Faults of Particular persons; and the Canons which seem'd to involve the Whole Body; with Sharpness and Threats: they took the case to be so clear upon an old Canon (the Only one they acknowledged for Or∣thodox) that <HI>Clericus non debet interesse Sanguini,</HI> that they were con∣tent <Q>“”to refer That to the House of Peers, as proper only for Their determination.</Q> And this they did, not upon any Confidence they had in the Matter it self, whatever Law, or Reason, or Canon they pre∣tended; or in the Lords, the major part of whom, when any difference of opinion was, allways dissented from Their designs: but that they <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> had a trick of doing their business by Intimation; and had a sure Friend amongst the Bishops, who had promised them seasonably to free them of that trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="1930"/>
THEY would not trust their Lordships own Inclinations with the other point, of the new Barons, which they knew would be contro∣verted; but in plain terms demanded, <Q>“”that no Peer, created since the day upon which the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was Impeach'd of High Treason, because They were involv'd as Commoners in the making that Accu∣sation, should sit as Judges at his Trial.</Q></P>
<P>FOR the Earl's demand, <Q>“”of an Order to Examine some Members on his behalf,</Q> upon matters of fact, at his Trial; after a long Debate, they left it only in the Power of the Persons Themselves who were no∣minated, "to be Examin'd if they would (not without some smart Animadversions, "that they should take heed What they did) and re∣sused to Enjoin them; though the same had been done at Their desire, for the Lords of the Council: but that was Against the Earl, and so the Less to be consider'd.</P>
<P>THE Lords, in the absence of the Lord Keeper, who was very Sick, made choice of the Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> to Preside and Govern the Court; being a person notoriously Disaffected to the Earl of <HI>Strafford.</HI></P>
<P>AND for the great business of the Bishops, they were saved the labour of giving any Rule (which it may be would have troubled them) by <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="line"/> the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s standing up, and moving, on the behalf of Him∣self and his Brethren, <Q>“”that They might be Excused from being present at the Trial, being Ecclesiastical Persons, and so not to have Their hands in Blood;</Q> and such other Reasons, as, when they are examin'd, will not be found of very great weight.</P>
<P>THIS Bishop had been, by several Censures in the Star-chamber, Im∣prison'd in the Tower, where he remain'd till after the beginning of this Parliament, and was then set at Liberty upon the desire of the Lords; who knew him to be a mortal and irreconcileable Enemy to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury:</HI> and indeed, he had allways been a Puritan so <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> far as to love None of the Bishops, and to have used Many learned Church▪men with great Contempt and Insolence: and yet he left no way unpractised to assure the King, <Q>“”that he would do great matters in Par∣liament for His Service,</Q> if he might be at Liberty. The next day after He came to the House of Peers, the Lord <HI>Say</HI> made that Speech, which he since Printed; taking notice <Q>“”of some Imputations laid on him by the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI></Q> That he should be a Sectary; which nobody can doubt, that reads that Speech: Yet he had no sooner done, than that Bishop rose, and made a large Panegyrick in his Praise, and profess'd, <Q>“”that he allways believ'd his Lordship to be as far from <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> a Sectary,</Q> as Himself. And when he found the great desire of the House of Commons, to be freed from the Bishops Votes in that Trial; he never left Terrifying them with the Censure that hung over Their heads for making the Canons, till he Perswaded them to Ingratiate them∣selves, by desiring to be Excused in that matter, before an Order should be made for their Absence.</P>
<P>THIS Example of the Bishops, prevail'd with some Lords, who had been created since the Accusation, to quit Their Right of Judging; and amongst them the Lord <HI>Littleton</HI> (who had been made a Baron upon the desire of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> for that only reason, that he pro∣fess'd, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”If he were a Peer, he would (and indeed he could) do Him notable Service) was the First who quitted his right to Judge,</Q> because he had been a Commoner when the Accusation was first brought up: but they who Insisted upon their Right (as the Lord <HI>Seymour,</HI> and others)
<PB N="172" REF="1940"/>
and demanded the Judgement of the House, were no more disturb'd, but exercised the same Power to the end, as any of the other Lords did; and so, no doubt, might the Bishops too, if they would: For, though there might be some reason for Their absence, when the Trial was ac∣cording to Law, Before and by his Peers only; Yet, when that Judge∣ment was waved, and a Bill of Attainder brought up against him, Their Votes in that Bill were as Necessary and Essential, as of any Other of the Lords. And it may be, their Unseasonable, Voluntary, Unjust quit∣ting it Then, made many men less sollicitous for the Defence of Their Right Afterwards. But of that in its place. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> ALL things being thus prepared, and settled; On <HI>Monday,</HI> the Twen∣ty second of <HI>March,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was brought to the Bar in <HI>Westminster</HI>-Hall; the Lords sitting in the Middle of the Hall in their Robes; and the Commoners, and some Strangers of Quality, with the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners, and the Committee of <HI>Ireland,</HI> on either Side; there being a close Box made at one End, at a very convenient distance for Hearing, in which the King and Queen sate untaken notice of: His Majesty, out of Kindness and Curiosity, desiring to hear All that could be alledged: of which, I believe, he afterwards repented himself; when "His having been Present at the Trial, was alledged and urged to <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> him, as an Argument for the Passing the Bill of Attainder.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Charge <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> AFTER the Earls Charge was read, and an Introduction made by M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Pym,</HI> in which he call'd him <HI>the Wicked Earl;</HI> some Member of the House of Commons, according to Their parts assign'd, being a Law∣yer, Applied and press'd the Evidence, with great licence and sharpness of language; and, when the Earl had made his Defence, Replied with the same liberty upon whatsoever he said; taking all occasions of bitterly Inveighing against his Person: which Reproachful way of carriage was look▪d upon with so much Approbation, that one of the Managers (M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Palmer)</HI> lost all his Credit and Interest with them, and never recover'd <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> it, for using a Decency and Modesty in his carriage and language towards him; though the Weight of His Arguments press'd more upon the Earl, than all the Noise of the Rest.</P>
<P>THE Trial lasted Eighteen days; in which, <Q>“”all the Hasty or Proud Expressions, or Words, He had utter'd at any time since he was first made a Privy-Counsellor; all the acts of Passion or Power that he had exercised in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> from the time that he was first President there▪ his engaging himelf in Projects in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as the sole making of Flax, and selling Tobacco in that Kingdom; his billetting of Soldiers, and exercising of Martial Law there; his extraordinary way of Pro∣ceeding <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> against the Lord <HI>Mountnorris,</HI> and the Lord Chancellor <HI>Lof∣tus;</HI> his assuming a Power of Judicature at the Council-Table, to determine Private Interests, and matter of Inheritance; some rigorous and extrajudicial Determinations in cases of Plantations; some high Discourses at the Council-Table in <HI>Ireland;</HI> some casual and light Di∣scourses at his Own Table, and at Publick Meetings; and lastly, some Words spoken in secret Council in this Kingdom, after the Dissolution of the last Parliament,</Q> were urged and press'd against him, to make good the General Charge, of <Q>“”an Endeavour to Overthrow the Funda∣mental Government of the Kingdom, and to Introduce an Arbitrary <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Power.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> THE Earl behaved himself with great shew of Humility and Sub∣mission; but yet, with such a kind of Courage, as would lose no advan∣tage;
<PB N="173" REF="1950"/>
and, intruth, made his Defence with all imaginable Dexterity; an∣swering This charge, and evading That, with all possible Skill and Elo∣quence: and though he knew not, till he came to the Bar, upon what Parts of his Charge they would proceed against him, or what Evidence they would produce, he took very little time to Recollect himself, and left nothing unsaid that might make for his own Justification.</P>
<P>FOR the business of <HI>Ireland;</HI> He complain'd much, <Q>“”that by an Or∣der from the Committee which prepared his Charge against him, all his Papers in that Kingdom, by which he should make his Defence, <MILESTONE N="1$" UNIT="line"/> were seiz'd and taken from him; and by virtue of the same Order, all his Goods, Houshold-stuff, Plate, and Tobacco (amounting, as he said, to Eighty Thousand pounds) were likewise seiz'd; so that he had not money to subsist in Prison: that all those Ministers of State in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> who were most Privy to the Acts for which he was Question'd, and so could give the best Evidence and Testimony on his behalf, were Imprison'd under the charge of Treason. Yet he averr▪d, That he had behaved himself in that Kingdom, according to the Power and Au∣thority granted by his Commission and Instructions; and according to the Rules and Customs observ'd by former Deputies and Lieutenants. <MILESTONE N="2$" UNIT="line"/> That the Monopolies of Flax and Tobacco, had been undertaken by Him for the Good of that Kingdom, and Benefit of his Majesty: the Former establishing a most beneficial Trade and good Husbandry, not before practised There; and the Latter bringing a Revenue of above Forty Thousand pounds to the Crown, and advancing Trade, and bringing no damage to the Subject.</Q> That Billetting of Soldiers (which was alledged to be Treason, by a Statute made in <HI>Ireland</HI> in the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth) <Q>“”and the exercising of Martial Law, had been allways practised by the Lieutenants and Deputies of that Kingdom;</Q> which he proved, by the Testimony and Confession of the Earl of <HI>Cork,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and the Lord <HI>Wilmot;</HI> neither of which, desired to say more for his behoof, than inevitably they must. He said, <Q>“”the Act of Parliament mention'd, of <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, concern'd not Him; it comprehending only the Inferior Subjects, and making it Penal to Them to billet Sol∣diers, not the Deputy, or Supreme Commander; if it did, that it was Repeal'd by <HI>Poyning</HI>▪s Act, in the Eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the Se∣venth: However, if it were not, and that it were Treason still, it was Treason only in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and not in <HI>England;</HI> and therefore, that he could not be Tried Here for it,</Q> but must be transmitted Thither. He said, <Q>“”the Council-Table in <HI>Ireland,</HI> had a Large, Legal Jurisdiction, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> by the Institution and Fundamental Customs of that Kingdom; and had, in all times, Determin'd matters of the Same nature, which it had done in His time: and that the Proceedings There upon Plantations, had been with the Advice of the Judges, upon a clear Title of the Crown, and upon great Reason of State: and that the Nature and Dis∣position of that People, required a Severe Hand and Strict Reins to be held upon them, which being loosed, the Crown would quickly feel the Mischief.</Q></P>
<P>FOR the several Discourses, and Words, wherewith he was charged; he Denied many, and Explain'd and put a Gloss upon others, by the rea∣sons <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and circumstances of the Debate. One particular, on which They much insisted, though it was spoken twelve years before, <Q>“”that He should say in the Publick Hall in <HI>York,</HI> That the Little Finger of the Pre∣rogative shouldly heavier upon them than the Loins of the Law,</Q> he
<PB N="174" REF="1960"/>
directly Inverted; and proved, by two or three Persons of Credit, <Q>“”that he said and the occasion made it probable,</Q> being upon the business of Knighthood, which was understood to be a Legal Tax) <Q>“”the Little Finger of the Law was heavier than the Loins of the Prerogative;</Q> that Imposition for Knighthood, amounting to a much higher rate, than any Act of the Prerogative which had been exercised. "However, he said, <Q>“”he hoped no Indiscretion, or Unskilfulness, or Passion, or Pride of Words, would amount to Treason; and for Misdemeanours, he was ready to Submit to their Justice.</Q></P>
<P>HE made the least, that is, the worst Excuse, for those Two Acts <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> against the Lord <HI>Mountnorris,</HI> and the Lord Chancellor; which indeed were Powerful Acts, and manifested a nature excessively Imperious; and no doubt, caused a greater Dislike and Terror, in Sober and Dispassionate Persons, than All that was alledged against him. A Servant of the Earl's, one <HI>Annesley</HI> (Kinsman to <HI>Mountnorris</HI> attending on his Lord during some Fit of the Gout (of which he often labour'd) had by accident, or negligence, suffer▪d a Stool to fall upon the Earl's Foot; enraged with the Pain whereof, his Lordship with a small Cane struck <HI>Annesley:</HI> this being merrily spoken of at dinner, at a Table where the Lord <HI>Mount∣norris</HI> was (I think, the Lord Chancellor's) He said, <Q>“”the Gentleman <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> had a Brother that would not have taken such a Blow.</Q> This coming some months after to the Deputies hearing, he caused a Council of War to be call'd; the Lord <HI>Mountnorris</HI> being an Officer of the Army; where, upon an Article <Q>“”of moving Sedition, and stirring up the Sol∣diers against the General,</Q> He was charged with those Words formerly spoken at the Lord Chancellor's Table. What Defence he made, I know not; for he was so surprized, that he knew not what the matter was, when he was Summon'd to that Council: but the Words being proved, he was deprived of his Office (being then Vice-Treasurer) and his Foot-Company; committed to Prison; sentenced, "to lose his Head. The <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Office, and Company, were immediately disposed of; and He imprison'd, till the King sent him over a Pardon, by which he was discharged, with his Life; all the other parts of the Sentence being▪ fully exe∣cuted.</P>
<P>THIS seem'd to all men a most Prodigious course of Proceeding; that in a time of full Peace, a Peer of the Kingdom and a Privy-Counsellor; for an Unadvised, Passionate, Mysterious Word (for the Expression was capable of many Interpretations) should be call▪d before a Council of War, which could not reasonably be understood to have Then a Juris∣diction over Such Persons, and in Such Cases; and without any Pro∣cess, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> or Formality of Defence, in two hours should be Deprived of his Life and Fortune: the Injustice whereof, seem'd the more formidable, for that the Lord <HI>Mountnorris</HI> was known, for some time before, to stand in great Jealousy and Disfavour with the Earl: which made it look'd on as a pure act of Revenge; and gave all men warning, how they trusted themselves in the Territories where He commanded.</P>
<P>THE Earl, discharged Himself of the rigour and severity of the Sen∣tence, and laid it upon <Q>“”the Council of War; where he Himself not only forbore to be Present, but would not suffer his Brother, who was an Officer of the Army,</Q> to Stay there: he said, <Q>“”he had conjured the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Court, to proceed without any respect of favour or kindness to Him∣self; and that, assoon as He understood the Judgement of the Council, which was Unanimous, he declared publickly (as he had likewise done
<PB N="175" REF="1970"/>
before) That a hair of his head should not perish; and immediately wrote an earnest Letter to his Majesty, for the procuring his Pardon; which was by his Majesty, upon his Lordships recommendation and mediation, granted accordingly; and thereupon, the Lord <HI>Mountnor∣ris</HI> was set at Liberty: though, it is true, He was, after his enlarge∣ment,</Q> not suffer'd to come to <HI>England.</HI> He concluded, <Q>“”that the Lord <HI>Mountnorris</HI> was an Insolent person; and that he took This course to humble him: and that he would be very well content, that the Same course might be taken to reform Him; if the same Care might like∣wise <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> be, that it might prove no more to His prejudice, than the other had been to that Lord.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the Standers by, made another Excuse for him: <Q>“”The Lord <HI>Mountnorris</HI> was a man of great Industry, Activity, and Experience, in the affairs of <HI>Ireland;</HI> having raised himself from a very private, mean condition (having been an inferior Servant to the Lord <HI>Chiche∣ster)</HI></Q> <Q>“”to the degree of a Viscount, and a Privy-Counsellor, and to a very ample Revenue in Lands and Offices; and had all ways, by Ser∣vile Flattery and Sordid Application, wrought himself into Trust and Nearness with all Deputies, at their first entrance upon their Charge, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> informing them of the Defects and Oversights of their Predecessors; and, after the determination of their Commands, and return into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> informing the State here, and those Enemies they usually con∣tracted in that time, of whatsoever they had done, or suffer'd to be done, amiss; whereby, they either suffer'd Disgrace, or Damage, assoon as they were recall'd from those Honours. In this manner, He be∣gun with his own Master, the Lord <HI>Chichester;</HI> and continued the same arts, upon the Lord <HI>Grandison,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> who suc∣ceeded; and upon that score, procured Admission and Trust with the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> upon His first admission to that Government: So <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that this <HI>Dilemma</HI> seem'd unquestionable, That either the Deputy of <HI>Ireland</HI> must destroy my Lord <HI>Mountnorris,</HI> whilst he continued in his Office, or my Lord <HI>Mountnorris</HI> must destroy the Deputy, assoon as his Commission was determin'd.</Q> And upon this Consideration; be∣sides, that his no virtue made him unpitied; many look'd with less con∣cernedness upon that Act, than the matter it Self deserv'd.</P>
<P>THE Case of the Lord Chancellor, seem'd, to Common Understand∣ings, an act of less Violence, because it concern'd not Life; and had some shew of Formality at least, if not Regularity in the Proceeding; and that which was Amiss in it, took its growth from a nobler Root than the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> other. The endeavour was, to compell the Lord Chancellor to settle more of his Land, and in another manner, upon his eldest Son, than he had a mind to, and than he could Legally be compell'd to: This the Earl, upon a Paper Petition preferr'd to him by the Wise of that Son (a Lady, for whom the Earl had so great a value and esteem, that it made his Justice the more suspected) press'd, and in the end order'd him to do. The Chancellor refused; was committed to Prison; and shortly af∣ter, the Great Seal taken from him, which he had kept with great repu∣tation of Ability for the space of above Twenty years. In the pressing this Charge, many things of Levity, as certain Letters of great Affection <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and Familiarity from the Earl to that Lady, which were found in her Cabinet after her death; others of Passion, were exposed to the publick view: to procure Prejudice rather to his Gravity and Discretion, than that they were in any degree Material to the business.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="1980"/>
THE Earl said little more to it, than <Q>“”that he hoped, what Passion soever, or what Injustice soever, might be found in that Proceeding, and Sentence, there would be no Treason: and that, for his part, he had yet reason to believe, what he had done was very Just; since it had been review'd by his Majesty, and his Privy-Council here, upon an Appeal from the Lord Viscount <HI>Ely</HI> (the degraded Lord Chancellor) and upon a solemn hearing There, which took up many days, it had receiv'd a Confirmation.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the truth is, That rather accused the Earl of an Excess of Power than absolv'd him of Injustice; for most men that weigh'd the whole <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> matter, believ'd it to be a high act of Oppression; and not to be without a mixture of that Policy, which was spoken of before in the Case of the Lord <HI>Mountnorris:</HI> For the Chancellor, being a person of great Expe∣rience, Subtilty, and Prudence, had been all ways very Severe to de∣parted Deputies; and not over agreeable, nor in any degree Submiss, to Their full Power; and taking Himself to be the Second person in the Kingdom, during the holding of his Place, thought himself little less than Equal to the First, who could naturally hope but for a term of Years in that Superiority: neither had he ever before met with the least Check, that might make him suspect a Diminution of his Authority, or <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Interest.</P>
<P>THAT which was with most Solemnity and expectation alledged against the Earl, as the Hinge upon which the Treason was principally to hang, was a Discourse of the Earl's in the Committee of State (which They call'd <HI>the Cabinet Council)</HI> upon the Dissolution of the former Parliament. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane</HI> the Secretary of State, gave in Evidence, <Q>“”That the King at that time calling that Committee to him, ask'd them, Since he fail'd of the assistance and supply he expected by Subsidies, what Course he should now take? that the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> answer'd, Sir, You have now done Your Duty, and your Subjects have fail'd <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in Theirs; and therefore you are absolv'd from the Rules of Govern∣ment, and may supply your self by Extraordinary Ways; You must prosecute the War Vigorously; You have an Army in <HI>Ireland,</HI> with which you may reduce this Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Northumber land</HI> being Examin'd, for the confirmation of this Proof, remember'd only, <Q>“”that the Earl had said, You have done your Duty,</Q> and are now absolv'd from the Rules of Government; but not a word of the Army in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or reducing this Kingdom. The Lord Marquis <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Lord Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> being likewise Examin'd, answer'd upon their Oaths, <Q>“”that <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> they heard none of those words spoken by the Earl.</Q> And These were the only Persons present at that Debate, save only the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and Secretary <HI>Windebank,</HI> neither of which could be Exa∣min'd, or would be Believ'd.</P>
<P>THE Earl positively denied the Words; <Q>alledged much Animosity“” to be in S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane</HI> towards him; and observ'd, "that not one of the other Witnesses, who were likewise present, and as like to Re∣member what was spoken, as the Secretary, heard one word of the <HI>Irish</HI> Army, or reducing this Kingdom: that if he had spoken those words, it could not be understood to be spoken of <HI>England,</HI> but of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of which the Discourse was, and for which that Army was known to be raised.</Q> He concluded, <Q>“”that if the words were spoken by him, which he expresly denied, they were not Treason; and if they were
<PB N="177" REF="1990"/>
Treason, that by a Statute made in <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth's time, one Wit∣ness was not sufficient to prove it, and that here was but one.</Q></P>
<P>SEVENTEEN days being spent in the whole progress of this Trial;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earls conclusion of his Defence.</NOTE> the Earl, having defended himself with wonderful dexterity and abi∣lity, concluded, <Q>“”that if the whole Charge (in which he hoped he had given their Lordships satisfaction of his Loyalty and Integrity, how great soever his Infirmities were) was proved, that the Whole made him not guilty of High Treason,</Q> and to that purpose desired, <Q>“”that his Learned Council might be heard;</Q> and most pathetically conjured <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="line"/> their Lordships, <Q>“”that for Their Own sakes, they would not, out of Dis∣pleasure or Disfavour towards His Person, create a Precedent to the Prejudice of the Peerage of <HI>England,</HI> and Wound Themselves through His Sides:</Q> which was good Counsel; and hath been since (though too late) acknowledged to be so.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Council heard, as to matters of Law.</NOTE> THE next day, his Council was heard in the same place to the matter of Law. And here I cannot pass by an Instance of as great Animosity, and Indirect Prosecution, in that circumstance of assigning him Coun∣cil▪ as can be given. After the House of Peers had assign'd him such Council as he desired, to assist him in matter of Law (which never was, <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="line"/> or can justly be denied to the most scandalous Felon, the most inhu∣man Murtherer, or the most infamous Traitor) the House of Commons, upon some occasion, took notice of it with Passion and Dislike, somewhat unskilfully, "that Such a thing should be done without Their consent; which was no more, than that the Judge should be directed by the Prosecutor, in what manner to proceed and determine: Others, with much Bitterness, inveighing against <Q>“”the Presumption of those Lawyers, that durst be of Counsel with a Person accused by Them of High Trea∣son;</Q> and moving, <Q>“”that They might be sent for, and Proceeded against for that Contempt:</Q> Whereas, They were not only Obliged to it, by <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the honour and duty of their Profession; but had been Punishable for refusing to submit to the Lords Orders. The matter was too Gross to re∣ceive any Publick Order, and so the Debate ended; but serv'd (and no doubt that was the Intention) to let those Gentlemen know, how Wari∣ly they were to demean themselves, lest the Anger of that terrible Congregation should be kindled against them.</P>
<P>BuT truly I have not heard that it made any Impression upon those<NOTE PLACE="marg">M <HI>Lane</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> Persons; it did not, I am sure, upon M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lane,</HI> who argued the matter of Law for the Earl. The Matters which were by Him principally In∣sisted on, and Averr'd with such Confidence as a man uses who believes <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> himself, were These:</P>
<P N="1">1.<Q>“”THAT by the Wisdom and Tenderness of Parliaments, which knew that there could not be a greater Snare for the Subject, than to leave the nature of Treason undefined and unlimited, All Treasons were particularly mention'd and set down in the Statute of the 25 <HI>Edw▪</HI> III <HI>de Proditionibus.</HI> That nothing is Treason, but what is com∣prehended within that Statute; all Treasons before that Statute, as Killing the King's Unkle, his Nurse, Piracy, and divers others, being restrain'd and taken away by the Declaration of that Act. And that no Words or Actions, in any of the Articles of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>s <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Charge,</Q> did amount to Treason within that Statute.</P>
<P N="2">2.<Q>“”THAT by reason of the Clause in that Statute, of declaring Trea∣son in Parliament, divers actions were declared to be Treasons in Par∣liament, in the time of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, to the great Pre∣judice
<PB N="178" REF="2000"/>
of the Subject: It was therefore specially Provided, and Enacted, by a Statute in the First year of the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, Chapter the Tenth, which is still in force, That nothing should be declared and adjudged Treason, but what was ordain'd in that Statute of the 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. by which Statute, all Power of declaring New Treasons in Parliament, was taken away; and that no Precedent of any Such Declaration in Parliament can be shew'd since that time: All New Treasons, made by any Act of Parliament in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, being by the Statute of the First year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> Chapter the First, taken away, and restrain'd to the 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and that likewise by another Statute of the First year of Queen <HI>Ma∣ry,</HI> Chapter the Tenth, All Trials of Treasons ought to be according to the Rules of the Commnon Law,</Q> and not otherwise.</P>
<P N="3">3.<Q>“”THAT the Foundation upon which the Impeachment was framed, was Erroneous; for that (besides that it was confess'd on all hands, the Laws of the Kingdom were Not subverted) an Endeavour to Subvert the Fundamental Laws and Statutes of the Realm, by Force attempted, is not Treason, being only made Felony by the Statute of the First year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> Chapter the Twelfth; which is likewise expired. That Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> in the Thirty third year of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, was indicted only of a Premunire, for an En∣deavour to bring in the Imperial Laws into this Kingdom. And that an Endeavour, or Intention, to levy War, was made Treason, only by a Statute of the 13<SUP>th</SUP> <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (a time very Inquisitive for Trea∣son)</Q> which expired with Her life.</P>
<P N="4">4.<Q>“”LASTLY, That if any thing was alledged against the Earl which might be Penal to him, it was not Sufficiently and Legally proved; for that by the Statute of the First year of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, Chapter the Twelfth, No man ought to be Arraign'd, Indicted, or Con∣demn'd, of any Treason, unless it be upon the Testimony of Two <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Lawful and Sufficient Witnesses, produced in the Presence of the Par∣ty accused; unless the party Confess the same: and if it be for Words, within Three Months after the same spoken, if the Party be within the Kingdom: Whereas there was in this Case only One Witness, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane,</HI></Q> and the words spoken Six Months before.</P>
<P>THE Case being thus stated on the Earl's behalf, the Judgement of the Lords, in Whom the Sole Power of Judicature was conceiv'd to be, was by all men expected; the House of Commons having declared, <Q>“”that They intended not to make any Reply to the Argument of Law made by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lane,</HI> it being below Their Dignity to contend with a <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Private Lawyer.</Q> Indeed They had a more convincing way to proceed<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill of Attainder brought into the House against the Earl.</NOTE> by; for the next day after that Argument, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur Haslerig</HI> (Bro∣ther in Law to the Lord <HI>Brook)</HI> an absurd, bold man, brought up by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym,</HI> and so employ'd by that Party to make any attempt, preferr'd a Bill in the House of Commons, <Q>“”for the Attainder of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> of High Treason:</Q> it being observ'd, that by what the Earl had said for himself in the matter of fact and in matter of prudence, of the Consequence of such an extraordinary Proceeding; and by what had been said for him in the point of Law; most Sober men, who had been, and still were, full enough of Dislike and Passion against the Earl, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> were not at all satisfied in the Justice of the Impeachment, or in the Man∣ner of the Prosecution: and therefore, that the House of Peers, which consisted of near one Hundred and Twenty, besides the Bishops, and of
<PB N="179" REF="2010"/>
whom Fourscore had been constantly attending the Trial, were not like to take upon Them the Burthen of such a Judgement as was expected.</P>
<P>THE Bill was receiv'd with wonderful alacrity, and immediately read the first and the second time, and so Committed: which was not usual in Parliaments, except in matters of great concernment and conve∣niency in the particular; or of little importance or moment in the ge∣neral. Those who at First consented, upon slight information, to his Im∣peachment, upon no other reason, but (as hath been said before) be∣cause <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> They were only to Accuse, and the Lords to Judge, and so thought to be troubled no more with it, being Now as ready to Judge, as they had been to Accuse; finding some new reasons to satisfy themselves, of which one was, "They had gone too far to Sit still, or Retire.</P>
<P>A DAY or two before the Bill of Attainder was brought into the House of Commons, there was a very remarkable Passage, of which, the Pretence was, <Q>“”to make One Witness, with divers Circumstances, as good as Two;</Q> though I believe it was directed Intruth to an End very forreign to that which was proposed. The words of the Earl of <HI>Straf∣ford,</HI> by which, <Q>“”his endeavour to alter the frame of Government, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> his intention to levy War,</Q> should principally appear, were proved Singly by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane;</HI> which had been often averr'd, and promised, should be proved by Several Witnesses; and the Law was clear, <Q>“”that less than Two Witnesses ought not to be receiv'd in case of Treason.</Q></P>
<P>To make this Single Testimony appear as Sufficient as if it had been confirm'd by more, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> inform'd the House of Commons, <Q>“”of the Grounds upon which he first advised that Charge, and was satisfied that he should sufficiently Prove it. That some months before the be∣ginning of this Parliament, He had visited young S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> eldest Son to the Secretary, who was then newly recover'd from an <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Ague; that They being together, and Condoling the sad condition of the Kingdom, by reason of the many Illegal Taxes and Pressures, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry</HI> told him, If he would call upon Him the next day, He would shew him somewhat that would give him much trouble, and inform him, What Counsels were like to be follow'd to the Ruin of the King∣dom; for that He had, in perusal of some of his Father's Papers, accidentally met with the Result of the Cabinet Council upon the Dissolution of the last Parliament, which comprehended the Resolu∣tions then taken.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THE next day He shew'd him a little Paper of the Secretary's own <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> writing; in which was contain'd the day of the Month, and the Results of several Discourses made by several Counsellors; with several Hic∣roglyphicks, which sufficiently express'd the Persons by whom those Discourses were made. The matter was of so Transcendent a Nature, and the Counsel so Prodigious, with reference to the Common-wealth, that he desired he might take a Copy of it; which the young Gen∣tleman would by no means Consent to, fearing it might prove Prejudi∣cial to his Father. But when M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> inform'd him, That it was of extream Consequence to the Kingdom, and that a time might proba∣bly come, when the Discovery of This, might be a Soveraign means <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to Preserve both Church and State, he was contented that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> should take a Copy of it; which he did, in the presence of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane;</HI> and having examin'd it, together with him, deliver'd the Ori∣ginal again to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry.</HI> That he had carefully kept this Copy by him,
<PB N="180" REF="2020"/>
without communicating the same to any body, till the beginning of this Parliament, which was the time he conceiv'd fit to make use of it; and that then, meeting with many other Instances of the Earl's Ill Disposition to the Kingdom, it satisfied him to move whatsoever he had moved, against that great Person.</Q></P>
<P>HAVING said thus much, he read the Paper in his hand; in which the day of the Month was set down, and his Majesty to be present, and stating the Question to be, <Q>“”What was now to be done? since the Parliament had Refused to give Subsidies for the supply of the War a∣gainst <HI>Scotland</HI></Q> There were then written, two <HI>LLs</HI> and a <HI>t</HI> over, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> an <HI>I</HI> and an <HI>r,</HI> which was urged, <Q>“”could signify nothing but <HI>Lord Liev∣tenant of Ireland;</HI></Q> and the Words written and applied to that Name, were, <Q>“”Absolv'd from Rules of Government;—Prosecute the War vi∣gorously;</Q>—An Army in <HI>Ireland</HI> to subdue this Kingdom—;which was urged, "to comprehend the matter of the Earl's Speech and Advice: that Paper, by Fractions of Words (without mentioning any Form'd Speech) containing only the Results of the several Counsellors Advice. Before those Letters which were order'd to signify the Lievtenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> were an <HI>A.B.C.G.</HI> which might be understood to signify, <HI>the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury his Grace;</HI> and at those Letters, some short <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> sharp expressions against Parliaments, and thereupon, fierce advice to the King. Next in the Paper, was an <HI>M</HI> with an <HI>r</HI> over, and an <HI>Ho,</HI> which were to be understood for Marquis <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who was <HI>Master of the Horse;</HI> and the words annex'd thereunto seem'd to be rough, but without a Supplement signified nothing. Then there was an <HI>L,</HI> an <HI>H,</HI> and an <HI>A,</HI> which must be interpreted <HI>Lord High Admiral,</HI> which was the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> and from that Hieroglyphick proceeded only a few words, which implied advice to the King, <Q>“”to be Advised by his Parliament.</Q> Then there was <HI>L<SUP>•</SUP> Cott.</HI> (which would easily be be∣liev'd to signify <HI>the Lord Cottington)</HI> with some expressions as sharp as <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> those applied to the Lievtenant of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he had read this Paper, he added; <Q>“”That though there was but One Witness directly in the point, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane</HI> the Secretary, whose Hand-writing that Paper was, whereof this was a Copy; Yet he conceiv▪d, those Circumstances of His; and young S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane'</HI>s having Seen those Original Results, and being ready to Swear, that the Paper read by Him was a true Copy of the other; might reasonably amount to the validity of Another Witness: and that it was no won∣der, that the Other persons mention'd in that Writing, who had given as bad Counsel, would not remember, for their Own sakes, what had <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> pass'd in that Conference; and that the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> (who was the only Good Counsellor in the pack) had remember'd Some of the words,</Q> of a high nature, though he had forgotten the Other.</P>
<P>WHEN M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> had ended, young S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane</HI> rose, in some seem∣ing Disorder; confess'd all that the Other had said; and added, <Q>“”That his Father being in the North with the King the Summer before, had sent up his Keys to his Secretary, then at <HI>White-Hall;</HI> and had Writ∣ten to Him (his Son) that He should take from him those Keys which open'd his Boxes where his Writings and Evidences of his Land were, to the end, that he might cause an Assurance to be perfected <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> which concern'd his Wife; and that He having perused those Evi∣dences, and dispatch'd what depended thereupon, had the curiosity to see what was in a red Velvet Cabinet which stood with the other
<PB N="181" REF="2030"/>
Boxes; and thereupon required the Key of that Cabinet from the Se∣cretary, as if he still wanted somewhat towards the business his Father had directed; and so having gotten the Key, he found, amongst other Papers, That mention'd by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym;</HI> which made that Impression in him, that he thought himself bound in Conscience to communicate it to some Person of better Judgement than himself, who might be more able to Prevent the Mischiefs that were threatned therein; and so shewed it to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym;</HI> and being confirm'd by Him, that the sea∣sonable Discovery thereof might do no less than Preserve the King∣dom, <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="line"/> had consented that He should take a Copy thereof; which, to His knowledge, he had faithfully done: and thereupon, had laid the Origi∣nal in its proper place again, in the red Velvet Cabinet. He said, He knew this Discovery would prove little less than his Ruin, in the good opinion of his Father; but having been induced, by the tender∣ness of his Conscience towards his Common Parent his Country, to Trespass against his natural Father, He hoped he should find Compas∣sion from that House, though he had little hopes of Pardon else∣where.</Q></P>
<P>THE Son no sooner sate down, than the Father (who, without any <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> counterfeiting, had a natural appearance of Sternness) rose, with a pret∣ty Confusion; and said, <Q>“”That the Ground of his Misfortune was N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w discover'd to him; that He had been much amazed, when he found himself press'd by such Interrogatories, as made him Suspect some Discovery to be made, by some Person as conversant in the Counsels as Himself: But he was now satisfied to Whom he ow'd his Misfor∣tunes; in which, He was sure, the Guilty Person should bear his share. That it was true, being in the North with the King; and that Un∣fortunate Son of his, having married a Virtuous Gentlewoman (Daugh∣ter to a worthy Member then present) to Whom there was some∣what <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in Justice and Honour due, which was not sufficiently settled; He had sent his Keys to his Secretary; not well knowing in what Box the material Writings lay; and directed him▪ to suffer his Son to look after those Evidences which were necessary: that by this occasion it seem'd, those Papers had been examin'd and perused, which had be∣got much of this trouble. That for His part, after the Summons of this Parliament, and the King's return to <HI>London,</HI> he had acquainted his Majesty, that he had many Papers remaining in his hands, of such transactions as were not like to be of further use; and therefore, if his Majesty pleased, he would Burn them, lest by any accident they <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> might come into hands that might make an ill use of them: to which his Majesty consenting, he had burn'd many; and amongst them, the Original Results of those Debates, of which, that which was read was pretended to be a Copy: that to the Particulars, He could say no∣thing more, than what he had upon his Examination express'd, which was exactly true, and he would not deny; though by what he had heard that afternoon (with which he was surprized and amazed) he sound himself in an Ill condition upon that Testimony.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Scene was so well acted, with such Passion and Gestures, be∣tween the Father and the Son, that many Speeches were made in com∣mendation <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of the Conscience, Integrity, and Merit, of the Young man, and a motion made, <Q>“”that the Father might be enjoin'd by the House to be Friends with his Son:</Q> but for sometime there was, in Publick, a great Distance observ'd between them.</P>
<P><PB N="$82" REF="2040"/>
MANY men wonder▪d very much at the unnecessary relation of this Story; which would visibly appear very Ridiculous to the world, and could not but inevitably produce much Scandal and Inconvenience to the Father, and the Son; who were too wise to believe, that those Cir∣cumstances would add any thing to the Credit of the former single Testi∣mony: neither was there ever after any mention of it in Publick, to move the Judgement of Those, who were concern'd to be Satisfied in what they were to do: and therefore Some who observ'd the Strata∣gems used by that Party to compass their own private ends, believ'd, that This occasion was taken to publish those Results, Only to give the Lord <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Cottington</HI> notice in what Danger he was, that so he might wisely quit his Mastership of the Wards to the Lord <HI>Say;</HI> who expected it, and might be able, by that obligation, to Protect him from farther Prosecution: and so that they meant to Sacrifice the Reputation of the Secretary, to the ambition of the Lord <HI>Say.</HI> But without doubt (though this last con∣sideration was very powerful with them) the true reason of the com∣munication of this Passage, was, that they found it would be impossible to Conceal their having receiv'd the Principal Information from the Secretary, for their Whole Prosecution; by reason of someof the Com∣mittee, who were intrusted to prepare the Charge against the Earl of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Strafford,</HI> and consequently were privy to that Secret, were fallen from them; at least from their Ends; and therefore they thought fit to Publish this History of the Intelligence, that it might be rather imputed to the Conscience, and Curiosity of the Son, than to the Malice of the Father.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The names of the Commo∣ners Dissent∣ing from the Bill, exposed under the Ti∣tle of Straf∣fordians.</NOTE> THE same day, as a Better Argument to the Lords speedily to Pass the Bill, the nine and fifty Members of the House of Commons, who (as is said before) had Dissented from that Act, had their Names written in pieces of Parchment or Paper, under this Superscription, STRAF∣FORDIANS, <HI>or Enemies to their Country;</HI> and those Papers fix'd upon <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Posts, and other the most visible places about the City; which was as great and destructive a Violation of the Priviledges and Freedom of Par∣liament, as can be imagin'd: yet, being Complain'd of in the House, not the least Countenance was given to the Complaint; or the least Care taken for the Discovery.</P>
<P>THE Persons who had still the Conduct of the Designs, began to find, that their Friends abroad (of whose help they had still great need, for the getting Petitions to be brought to the House; and for all Tumul∣tuous appearances in the City; and Negotiations with the Common Council) were not at all satisfied with them, for their want of Zeal in <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the matter of Religion: and, though they had Branded as many of the Bishops, and Others of the Prelatical party, as had come in their way; and receiv'd all Petitions against the Church, with encouragement: Yet, that there was Nothing done, or visibly in Projection to be done, to∣wards Lessening their Jurisdiction; or Indulging any of that Liberty to their Weak Brethren, which They had from the beginning expected from them.

<P>BuT the Truth is, They who had made in their hearts the most De∣structive Vows against the Church, never durst Communicate their <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Bloody Wishes to their best Friends, whose Authority gave Them their greatest Credit. For besides, that their Own Clergy, whose hands they produced in great numbers, to complain against the Innovations, which had (as They said) been introduced; and against the Ceremonies, which had been in constant practice Since the Reformation, as well as Before; were far from being of one Mind in the Matter or Manner of what they wish'd should be alter'd; as appear'd, when ever they came before the House, or a Committee, when any of them were ask'd Questions they did not expect: There was Less Consent amongst their Lay Friends, in Ecclesiastical affairs, than amongst the other.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> THE Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> had no desire that there should be any Altera∣tion in the Government of the Church; and had allways liv'd, towards my Lord of <HI>Canterbury</HI> himself, with all Respect and Reverence, and frequently visited and dined with him; Subscribed liberally to the Re∣pair
<PB N="184" REF="2060"/>
of S <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, and Seconded all Pious undertakings: though, it is true, he did not discountenance notoriously, those of the Clergy who were Unconformable.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> was rather Displeased with the Person of the Arch-Bishop, and some other Bishops, than Indevoted to the Function; and towards some of them, he had great Reverence and Kindness, as Bishop <HI>Moreton,</HI> Bishop <HI>Hall,</HI> and some other of the less Formal, and more Popular Prelates: and He was as much Devoted as any man to the Book of Common-Prayer, and obliged all his Servants to be constant∣ly present with him at it; his Houshold Chaplain, being allways a most <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Conformable man, and a good Scholar.</P>
<P>IN truth, in the House of Peers, there were only at that time taken notice of, the Lords <HI>Say</HI> and <HI>Brooke,</HI> as Positive Enemies to the Whole Fabrick of the Church, and to desire a Dissolution of that Government; the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> himself, having never discover'd any Aversion to Episcopacy, and much profess'd the Contrary.</P>
<P>IN the House of Commons, though of the chief Leaders, <HI>Natha∣niel Fiennes,</HI> and young S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> and shortly after M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden</HI> (who had not before own'd it) were believ'd to be for Root and Branch; which grew shortly after a common Expression, and Discovery of the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> several Tempers: Yet, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> was not of that mind, nor M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hollis,</HI> nor any of the Northen men, or those Lawyers who drove on most furiously with them; All who, were pleased with the Government it Self of the Church.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Bill <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> THE First Design that was entertain'd against the Church; and which was receiv'd in the House of Commons, with a visible Countenance and Approbation of many, who were neither of the same Principles nor Purposes; was a short Bill that was brought in, <Q>“”to take away the Bishops Votes in Parliament; and to leave them out in all Commissions of the Peace,</Q> or that had relation to any Temporal affairs. This was con∣trived, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> with great Deliberation and Preparation, to dispose men to Con∣sent to it: And to this, many of the House of Peers were much dis∣posed; and amongst Them, none more than the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and all the Popular Lords; who observ'd, <Q>“”that they seldom carried any thing, which directly opposed the King's interest, by reason of the number of the Bishops, who, for the most part, unanimously concurr'd against it, and opposed many of their other designs: and they believ'd, that it could do the Church no harm, by the Bishops having fewer Diver∣sions from their Spiritual Charges.</Q></P>
<P>IN the House of Commons, they used That, and other Arguments, to <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> remove the Prejudice from it; and, As there were Many who were perswaded, that the Passing that Bill would be no Prejudice; and were as unwilling, that the Bishops should be Justices of the Peace, or in any other Secular Commissions, as the Lords were, that they should Sit with them: So they prevail'd with Others, who heartily desired that there might be no such Diminution of Their Honour and Authority, by perswading Them, <Q>“”That there was so great a Concurrence towards the Passing this Bill; and so great a Combination throughout the Na∣tion against the whole Government of the Church, and a Resolution to Destroy it absolutely: in which the <HI>Scots</HI> were so resolutely en∣gaged, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that They discoursed in all Companies, That it was Impossible for a firm Peace to be preserv'd between the Nations, if Bishops were not taken away; and that the Army would never march out of the
<PB N="185" REF="2070"/>
Kingdom, till that were brought to pass: But that if this Bill were once Pass'd, a greater number in Both Houses would be so well Satis¦fied, that the Violenter Party would be never able to prosecute Their Designs.</Q> And this reason did prevail over many men of excellent Judgements, and unquestionable Affections; who did intruth at that time believe, <Q>“”that the Passing this Act, was the only expedient to Pre∣serve the Church:</Q> insomuch, as when it was brought into the House, it found a better reception than was expected; and some men, who, others thought, would have opposed it, spoke on its behalf, expressing <MILESTONE N="1$" UNIT="line"/> their desire "that it might Pass.</P>
<P>THERE was a Difference in Opinion in this Debate, between Two persons, who had been never known to differ in the House, and the en∣tire Friendship they had for each other was very remarkable; which ad∣ministred much Pleasure to very many who loved neither of them. When the Bill was put to the Question, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> (who was from the be∣ginning known to be an Enemy to it) spoke very earnestly <Q>“”for the Throwing it out; said, "It was Changing the whole Frame and Con∣stitution of the Kingdom; and of the Parliament it Self: That from the time that Parliaments begun, there had never been one Parliament, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> where the Bishops were not part of it: That if They were taken out of the House, there would be but Two Estates left; for that They as the Clergy were the Third Estate, and being taken away, there was Nobody left to represent the Clergy: which would introduce Ano∣ther piece of Injustice, which no Other part of the Kingdom could Com∣plain of, who were All represented in Parliament, and were there∣fore bound to Submit to all that was Enacted, because it was upon the matter with their Own consent: Whereas, if the Bishops were taken from Sitting in the House of Peers, there was Nobody who could pre∣tend to represent the Clergy; and yet They must be bound by Their <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> determinations.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN He had done; the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> who allways sate next to him (which was so much taken notice of, that, if they came not into the House together, as usually they did, every body left the place for him that was absent) suddainly stood up, and declared himself <Q>“”to be of Another opinion; and that, As he thought the thing it self to be ab∣solutely necessary for the Benefit of the Church, which was in so great Danger; So he had never heard, that the Constitution of the King∣dom would be Violated by the Passing that Act; and that He had heard Many of the Clergy protest, That they could Not acknowledge <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that They were represented by the Bishops. However we might pre∣sume, That if they could make that appear, that They were a Third Estate, that the House of Peers (amongst whom They sat, and had Yet their Votes)</Q> would Reject it. And so, with some Facetiousness, an∣swering some other particulars, concluded, "for the Passing the Act</P>
<P>THE House was so marvellously Delighted, to see the Two insepara∣ble Friends Divided in so Important a point, that they could not con∣tain from a kind of Rejoycing; and the more, because they saw M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> was much Surprized with the Contradiction; as intruth he was; having never discovered the least Inclination in the Other, towards Such <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> a compliance: and therefore they entertain'd an Imagination, and Hope that they might work the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> to a Farther Concurrence with them. But they quickly found themselves Disappointed; and that, As there was not the least Interruption of cloth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> between the
<PB N="186" REF="2080"/>
other Two; So, when the same Argument came again into Debate, about six months after, the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> Changed his opinion, and gave them all the Opposition he could: nor was he reserv'd in acknowledging, that he had been Deceiv'd, and by Whom; and confess'd to his Friends, with whom he would deal freely, <Q>“”that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden</HI> had assured him, that if That Bill might Pass, there would be nothing More attempted to the Prejudice of the Church:</Q> which He thought, as the world Then went, would be no Ill composition.</P>
<P>THIS Bill, for taking away the Bishops Votes out of the House of Peers, produced another Discovery, which cast the Conductors farther <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Behind, than they were Advanced by their conquest amongst the Com∣mons; and Disquieted them much more, than the other had Exalted them. How currently soever it had pass'd in the Lower House; when it was brought to the Upper, the Lords gave it not so gracious a re∣ception as was expected: Many of the greatest men of that House, grew Weary of the Empire which the Others had exercised over them; and Some, who had gone with them, upon their observation that they had Worse Designs than they own'd, fell from them, and took the opportu∣nity to discover themselves, upon the Debate of this Bill; against which, they Inveigh'd with great Sharpness; and Blamed the House of Com∣mons, <MILESTONE N="2$" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”for Presuming to meddle with an affair, that so immediately concern'd Themselves: That if they might send up a Bill This day, at Once to take out one whole Bench from the House, as they would do the Bishops, they might to Morrow send Another, to take away the Barons,</Q> or some other degree of the Nobility: with many more Ar∣guments, as the nature of the thing would easily administer; with such Warmth, and Vigour, as They had not before express'd: Insomuch as, though the other Party, which had not hitherto been withstood, set up Their Rest upon the carrying it; supplying their other Arguments with that, <Q>“”How much the House of Commons, which best knew the tem∣per <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and expectation of the Nation, would Resent their Not concurring with them, in a Remedy they judged so necessary; and what the Consequence might be, of such a Breach between the Two Houses, they trembled to think; since the Kingdom had no hope of being Preserv▪d but by Their Union, and the effects of their Wisdom, in Removing all Things, and all Persons, out of the way, which were like to Ob∣struct such a through Reformation,</Q> as the Kingdom needs and expects▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">The House of Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Bill</NOTE> All which, had so little effect, that the House could not be prevail'd with, so much as to Commit the Bill (a countenance, they frequently give to Bills they never intend to pass) but at the Second reading it, they <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> utterly cast it out.</P>
<P>THIS unexpected, and unimagin'd act, cast such a Damp upon the Spirits of the Governing Party, in both Houses, that they knew not what to do: the Mischiefs which were in view, by this discovery of the tem∣per of the House of Peers, had no bottom; they were not now sure, that they should be able to carry any thing; for the major part, which threw out this Bill, might cross them in any thing they went about: besides the Influence it would have in the House of Commons, and every where else; for they knew very well, how Many of their followers Therefore follow'd Them, because they believ'd They would carry all before them. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>HOWEVER, that Their Spirits might not be thought to fail, they made hast to proceed in all the angry▪ and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hol▪ rick things before them:

<P>THE Opposition in the Lords House, and the frequent Contradiction in the House of Commons, had allay'd much of the Fury which had so much prevail'd; and all men impatiently desired that the Armies might be discharged; when all men believ'd, better quarter would be kept: but no progress would be made towards that, till the Earl of <HI>Straf∣ford's</HI> business could be dispatch'd; the <HI>Scots,</HI> being bound to gratify <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> their <HI>English</HI> Friends in that particular, as if it were their Own work.

proceeded with more Passion in many things, than he ought to have done, by which he had render'd himself Useless to His Service for the future; and therefore He was well content, that he might be made Incapable of any Employment for the time to come; and that he should be Banish'd or Imprison'd for his life, as They should choose: That if they would take his Death upon Them, by their Own Judica∣tory▪ He would not Interpose any act of his Own Conscience: But since they had declined That way, and meant to proceed by an Act of Parliament, to which He himself must be a Party, that it could not consist with His Conscience, ever to give his Royal Assent to that Act; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> because,</Q> having been present at the whole Trial (as he had been, in a Box provided on purpose, <HI>Incognito,</HI> though Conspicuous enough) <Q>“”and heard all the Testimony they had given against him, He had heard no∣thing Proved, by which he could believe that he was a Traitor, ei∣ther in Fact, or in Intention: and therefore his Majesty did most ear∣nestly desire, that the two Houses would not bring him a Bill to Pass, which in Conscience he could not,</Q> and would not Consent to.</P>

<P>HE shook his head, and answer'd, <Q>“”Stone Dead hath no Fellow: that if he were judged Guilty in a Premunire, according to the Precedents cited by Him; or Fined in any other way; and Sentenced to be Im∣prison'd during his life; the King would presently grant him his Par∣don, and his Estate, release all Fines, and would likewise give him his Liberty, as soon as He had a mind to receive his Service; which would be assoon as the Parliament should be ended.</Q> And when M<SUP>r</SUP> <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Hyde</HI> was ready to reply to him; the Earl told him Familiarly, <Q>“”that He had been Tired that afternoon upon that Argument, and therefore desired him to continue the discourse no longer Then; assuring him, He would be ready to Confer with him upon it at any other time.</Q></P>
<P>SHORTLY after, M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> took another opportunity to speak freely with him again concerning it, but found him upon his guard; and though he heard all the Other would say, with great patience, yet he did not at all enlarge in his answers, but seem'd fix'd in his resolution: and when he was press'd, <Q>“”how Unjustifiable a thing it was, for any man to do any thing which his Conscience inform'd him was Sinful; that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> He knew him so well, that if He were not Satisfied in his Own Con∣science, of the Guilt of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> the King could never be able to oblige him to give his Vote for that Bill; and therefore He wonder'd, how he could urge the King, to do an act which He de∣clared to be so Much against his Conscience, that he neither could, nor would, ever give his Royal Assent to that Bill:</Q> The Earl an∣swer'd more at large, and with some commotion (as if he were intruth possess'd with that opinion himself) <Q>“”That the King was obliged in Conscience, to conform Himself, and his own Understanding, to the Advice and Conscience of his Parliament:</Q> which was a Doctrine new∣ly <MILESTONE N="3$" UNIT="line"/> resolv'd by Their Divines, and of great Use to them for the pursuing their future Counsels.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all this, the Bill had not that warm reception in the House of Peers, that was expected; but, after the First reading, rested many days; and being then read the Second time, depended long at the Committee: few men believing, upon consideration of the Af∣fections and Parts of the Several Lords, that of the Fourscore, who were present at the Trial, above Twenty would ever have Consented to that Act: Besides, it was not believ'd, now the Formal Trial and way of Ju∣dicature was waved, the Bishops would so Stupidly (to say no worse) <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Exclude themselves from Voting in a Law, which was to be an Act of parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Accidents that contribu∣ted much to∣wards Passing the Bill against the Earl of <HI>Strafford:</HI></NOTE> BUT there happen'd about that time Two Accidents, which (though not Then, or it may be Since, taken notice of, as of any moment or re∣lation to That business) contributed strangely to the Passing that Bill; and so to the Fate of that great Person.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> SOME Principal Officers of the Army, who were Members of the House of Commons, and had been Caress▪d, both before and after the Be∣ginning of the Parliament, by the most Popular Agents of both Houses; and had intruth Contributed more to Their Designs, than was agree∣able to their Duty, and the Trust reposed in them by the King; found themselves Now not so Particularly consider'd as they expected, by that Party; and their Credit in other places, and particularly in the Army, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to be lessen'd: for that there was visibly much more Care taken, for the Supply of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army, than of the King's; insomuch, that sometimes money that was assign▪d and paid for the use of the King's Army, was again taken away, and disposed to the Other: and yet, that the Parliament much presumed, and depended, upon their Interest in, and Power to dispose, the Affections of that Army.</P>
<P>THEREFORE to redeem what had been done amiss, and to ingra∣tiate themselves in his Majesty's favour, they bethought themselves how to dispose, or at least to pretend that they would dispose, the Army, to some such expressions of Duty and Loyalty towards the King, as <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> might take away all hope from other men, that it might be applied to His disservice: and to that purpose, they had Conference, and Commu∣nication, with some Servents of a more immediate trust and relation to Both their Majestics▪ through Whom they might convey their Inten∣tions and Devotions to the King, and again receive his Royal Pleasure, and Direction, How they should demean themselves. For ought I could ever observe, by what was afterwards reported in the House of Com∣mons; or could learn, from Those who were most Conversant with all the Secrets of That design; there was never the least intention of work∣ing farther upon the Affections of the Army, than to Preserve them <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> from being Corrupted, or made use of, for the Imposing Unjust and Unreasonable things upon the King: and all that the King ever so much as Consented should be done by Them, was, that as most Counties in <HI>England,</HI> or rather, the Factious and Seditious persons in most Counties, having been induced to Frame and Subscribe Petitions to the Parlia∣ment, against the Establish'd Government of the Church, with other Clauses, Scandalous to the Government of the State too; So the Officers of the Army too, should Subscribe this following Petition; which was brought Ingross'd to his Majesty for his Approbation, before they would presume to recommend it to any for their Subscription. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>

But that which begets the Trouble and Disquiet of Our loyal hearts, at this present, is, that we hear Those ill affected Persons, are back'd in their Vio∣lence, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> by the Multitude and the Power of raising Tumults; that Thousands flock at Their call, and beset the Parliament, and <HI>White-Hall</HI> it self; not only to the Prejudice of that Freedom which is necessary to great Councils and Judicatories, but possi∣bly

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The true mat∣ter of fact con∣cerning that Petition.</NOTE> HIS Majesty having read this Petition, and conceiving that the Au∣thority of the Army might seem of as great Importance for the good re∣ception of so much Reason and Justice, as the Subscription of a Rab∣ble had been alledged often to be, for the Countenance of what intruth was Mutinous and Seditious, said, <Q>“”that He approved well enough of it, and was content that it might be Subscribed by the Officers of the Ar∣my, if They desired it.</Q> The Officer who presented the Draught to his Majesty, told him, <Q>“”that very Few of the Army had yet seen it: and that it would be a great Countenance to it, if, when it was carried to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Principal Officers who were first to Sign it, any evidence might be given to them, that it had pass'd his Majesty's approbation; other∣wise they might possibly make Scruple for fear of offending Him.</Q> Thereupon, his Majesty took a Pen, and writ at the bottom of the Peti∣tion <HI>C.

<P>THE Meetings continuing, between those Officers of the Army and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> some Servants of his Majesty's, to the Ends aforesaid; Others of the Army, who had express'd very brisk resolutions towards the Service, and were of eminent Command and Authority with the Soldiers, were by special direction introduced into those Councils (all persons obliging themselves by an Oath of Secrecy, not to communicate any thing that should pass amongst them) for the better executing what should be agreed.</P>
<P>AT the first meeting, One of the Persons that was so introduced, after he had heard the calm Propositions of the rest, and that <Q>“”Their de∣sign was, only to observe and defend the Laws, that Neither the Ar∣guments <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of the <HI>Scots,</HI> nor the Reputation of their Army, might com∣pell the King to Consent to the Alteration of the Government of the Church, nor to remove the Bishops out of the House of Peers, which
<PB N="195" REF="2170"/>
would, in a great degree, produce an Alteration; Or the Power of any Discontented Persons, by their Tumultuary Petitions, Impose upon, or Diminish, the Just Legal Power of the King: told them, "Those Resolutions would produce very little effects for his Majesty's Service; That there was but One way to do his Majesty notable Service, which was by bringing up the Army presently to <HI>London,</HI> which would so Aw the Parliament, that they would do any thing the King com∣manded.</Q> There was not (as I have been credibly inform'd) a man in the company, that did not perfectly abhor (or seem'd so do) that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> odious Proposition; but contented themselves with making such Ob∣jections against it, as render'd it Ridiculous and Unpracticable: and so the Meeting, for that time, dissolv'd.</P>
<P>WHETHER the Person that proposed this desperate advice, did it on∣ly as a Bait, to draw an opinion from other men (for he had a perfect dislike and malice to some of the company) or whether the Disdain to see his Counsel rejected, and the Fear that it might be discover'd to his Disadvantage, wrought upon him, I know not; But the same, or the next day, He discover'd All, and More than had pass'd, to some of Those who seem'd to take most care for the Publick; intimated to them, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”how He was Startled with the horrour of the design, and how Faith∣fully He resolv'd to serve the Common-wealth, or to lose his Life in the attempt:</Q> Yet, at the same time, acted his part at Court, with all possible demonstration of Abhorring the Proceedings of the Parlia∣ment, to that degree, that he offer'd, <Q>“”to undertake with a Crew of Of∣ficers and good Fellows (who, he said, were at His disposal) to Rescue the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> from the Lievtenant of the Tower, as he should bring him to his Trial, and so to enable him to make an escape in∣to Forreign parts.</Q></P>
<P>THE Discovery being thus made, to the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> the Lord <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Say,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and no doubt by Them communicated to their chief Associates; as Dangerous as the design was Afterwards al∣ledged to be, it was not Publish'd in three Months after to the Houses, against Whom the design was intended; nor till long after the death of the Earl of <HI>Bedford:</HI> who, no doubt rather desired to bind up those Wounds which were made, than to make them wider, by entertaining new Jealousies between King and People; and would not consent to the extending and extorting Conclusions, which did not naturally flow from the Premises; without which, This so useful a Treason to them, could not have been made up.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> BUT as They thought not fit (as I said before) to publish this Whole Discovery till near three months after, so they made extraordinary Use of it by Parts, from the Instant that they found the Secret; it be∣ing allways their custom, when they found the Heat and Distemper of the House (which they endeavour'd to keep up, by the sharp mention and remembrance of former Grievances and Pressures) in any degree Al∣lay▪d, by some gracious Act, or gracious Profession of the King's to warm and inflame them again with a Discovery, or Promise of a Disco∣very, of some notable Plot and Conspiracy against Themselves, <Q>“”to Dis∣solve the Parliament by the Papists:</Q> or some other way, in which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> they would be sure that somewhat allways should reflect upon the Court. Thus they were sometimes informing, <Q>“”of great multitudes of Papists gathering together in <HI>Lancashire;</HI></Q> then <Q>“”of Secret Meetings in Caves, and under ground in <HI>Surrey;</HI> Letters from beyond Sea, of

And in this Progress, there sometimes happen'd strange Accidents for the confirmation of their credit.</P>
<P>WHILST they were full of Clamour against the Papists, upon the in∣stances of some Insolences and Indiscretions committed by them, during <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the late intervals of Parliament (and mention▪d before) especially upon a great Alacrity express'd, and Contribution raised, the year before, for advancing the War with <HI>Scotland;</HI> an Order was made, <Q>“”that the Justices of Peace of <HI>Westminster</HI> should carefully examine, what Stran∣gers were lodg'd within their Jurisdiction; and that they should ad∣minister the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to all suspected for Recusancy,</Q> and proceed according to those Statutes.

And though, for ought I could ever hear, it proceeded only from the rage of a sullen Varlet (formerly suspected to be Crazed in his understanding) without the least Confederacy or Combination with any other; Yet it was a great Coun∣tenarce to Those, who were before thought over Apprehensive and In∣quisitive into Dangers; and made Many believe it rather a Design of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> All the Papists of <HI>England,</HI> than a Desperate Act of One man, who could never have been induced to it, if he had not been promised Assistance by the rest.</P>

<P>SUCH a Committee was appointed to Examine, and such a Message <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> sent to his Majesty, as was desired. But in the mean time, some Persons who had been at the Tavern, and talk'd of raising men for <HI>Portugal;</HI> and Others who had been at the Conference before mention'd, where the Proposition was for bringing up the Army; finding that what had pass'd so Privately, and amongst Themselves, had been Discover'd; and was like to pass a very Severe Inquisition, from Them who made Glosses and Comments as they pleased, upon what other men spoke or did; and not knowing how much More than the Truth had been inform'd, or what Interpretation should be made of that which was the Truth; re∣solv'd not to trust themselves with Such Judges (whose formality was <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> first to Imprison, and after, at Their leisure, to Examine) and so fled into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was no sooner known and publish'd, than it gave great Credit and Reputation to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI>'s Vigilancy and Activity; for it now ap∣pear'd, there was some notable Mischief intended, upon the Disovery whereof, some Eminent men were Fled. And in this Disorder and Trou∣ble of mind, men Fearing according as they were directed, the Bill of Attainder found the easier passage in the House of Commons.</P>
<P>HAVING gotten thus much ground; and the Bill then depending (and like long to depend) with the Lords; M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> told them in the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> House of Commons, <Q>“”that it appear'd by the Flight of such Considera∣ble Persons, that what he had before imparted to them was of Mo∣ment, and that his Fears were not groundless; that it concern'd Their Service, that he should not Yet impart the whole matter to them, since the Danger was prevented, which they should shortly understand at large: in the mean time, he did assure them, That God had mira∣culously Preserv'd them from a most Prodigious Conspiracy, in which all their Priviledges and Liberties should have been swallow'd up: That though This attempt was Disappointed, yet he fear'd there might be some New device;</Q> and therefore He proposed, <Q>for the better evi∣dence <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of their Union and Unanimity (which would be the greatest Dis∣couragement to all who wish'd Ill to them) that some Protestation might be entred into by the Members of Both Houses, for the Defence of their Priviledges, and the Performance of those Duties to God and the King, which they were obliged to, as good Christians and good Subjects; and that a Committee might be appointed speedily, to with∣draw and prepare such a Protestation.</Q></P>
<P>THE Motion was entertain'd with general Approbation; insomuch as they who were apprehensive enough of the Ill Designs of those who advanced This, and of the Ill consequence of such Voluntary Protesta∣tions, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> thought fit rather to watch the Matter and Words, than to op∣pose the Thing it self; which, it was evident, it was to no purpose to do: and therefore they were well contented with the naming Such Per∣sons for the Committee, as were not like to submit to any Unlawful or

<P>THIS was immediately taken by the Speaker of the House of Com∣mons, and by all the Members then present; and sent up to the Lords, who all likewise took the same, except the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> who positively refused it, alledging, <Q>“”There was no Law that enjoin'd it, and the Consequence of such Voluntary Engage∣ments,</Q> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> might produce Effects that were not then intended: Which without doubt was very wisely consider'd; and had not been press'd in the House of Commons, for Two reasons; It being visibly Impossible to Dissuade the thing, the House being awaken'd by the discourse, men∣tion'd before, of a Plot against the Parliament, the Poyson of which, this soveraign Antidote was to Expell and Discover; But especially, for that well affected Persons, who were jealous of no other design than the Alteration of the Government of the Church, thought they had obliged those rigid Reformers from any such Attempt, when They had once Bound themselves <Q>“”to Maintain and Defend the Protestant Religion ex∣press'd <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> in the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England;</HI></Q> there being no other Scheme of the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than the Thir∣ty nine Articles, of which one is, <Q>“”to preserve the Government of the Church by Bishops.</Q></P>
<P>WHEREAS the other Party was abundantly gratified, with having an Oath of their Own making, to entangle the People (so like a Cove∣nant, by which such admirable things had been compass'd by their Neighbours) and upon which they could make what Gloss they pleased, when they had occasion; as they did within two days after: For the Protestation being taken on <HI>Monday</HI> the Third of <HI>May,</HI> the <HI>Wednesday</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> following, some of their own Party took occasion to inform the House, <Q>“”that it was apprehended by many well affected Persons abroad, who were of notable and exemplary devotions to the Parliament, That if

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The other Ac∣cident that contributed towards the Bill of At∣tainder, was the Death of the Earl of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaford.</HI></NOTE> THE other Accident that fell out during the time that the business of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was agitated, and by which He receiv'd much Prejudice, was the Death of the Earl of <HI>Bedford.</HI> This Lord was the greatest person of Interest in all the Popular Party, being of the best Estate, and best Understanding, of the whole Number; and therefore most like to Govern the Rest. He was besides, of great Civility, and of much more Good Nature than any of the Other. And therefore the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> King resolving to do his business with that Party by Him, resolv'd to make him Lord High Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> in the place of the Bishop of <HI>London;</HI> who was as willing to lay down the Office, as any body was to take it up. And to gratify him the more; at His desire, intended
<PB N="200" REF="2220"/>
to make M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> Chancellor of the Exchequer, as he had done M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Saint-John</HI> his Sollicitor General (all which hath been touch'd before) as al∣so, that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hollis</HI> was to be Secretary of State, the Lord <HI>Say</HI> Master of the Wards, and the Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> to be Lord Privy-Seal after the death of his Father, who then held that place. Others were to be placed about the Prince, and to have Offices when they fell.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> secretly undertook to his Majesty, that the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>▪s life should be preserv'd; and to procure His Revenue to be settled, as amply as any of his Progenitors; the which he in∣tended so really, that, to My knowledge, he had it in design to endea∣vour <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to obtain an Act for the setting up the Excise in <HI>England,</HI> as the only natural means to advance the King▪s profit. He fell Sick, within a week after the Bill of Attainder was sent up to the Lords House; and Died shortly after, much Afflicted with the Passion and Fury which he perceiv▪d his Party inclined to: insomuch as he declared, to some of near trust with him, <Q>“”that He fear'd, the Rage and Madness of this Par∣liament, would bring more Prejudice and Mischief to the Kingdom than it had ever sustain▪d by the long Intermission of Parliaments.</Q> He was a wise man, and would have proposed and advised Moderate courses; but was not incapable, for want of Resolution, of being carried into <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Violent ones, if His Advice were not submitted to: and therefore Many, who knew him well, thought his Death not unseasonable, as well to his Fame, as his Fortune; and that it rescued him as well from some pos∣sible Guilt, as from those visible Misfortunes, which all men of all con∣ditions have Since undergone.</P>
<P>As soon as the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> was dead, the Lord <HI>Say</HI> (hoping to receive the reward of the Treasurer-ship) succeeded him in his under∣taking, and faithfully promised the King, <Q>“”that he should not be press'd in the matter of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>▪s Life;</Q> and under that promise got credit enough, to perswade his Majesty to whatsoever He said <MILESTONE N="3$" UNIT="line"/> was necessary to that business. And thereupon, when the Bill was de∣pending with the Lords, and when there was little suspicion that it would Pass, though the House of Commons every day by Messages en∣deavour▪d to quicken them, He perswaded the King <Q>“”to go to the House of Peers, and according to custom to send for the House of Com∣mons, and then to declare himself, That He could not, with the safe∣ty of a good Conscience, ever give his Consent to the Bill, that was there depending before them concerning the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> if it should be brought to him, because He was not satisfied in the point of Treason: But He was so fully Satisfied that the Earl was Unfit ever <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to serve Him more, in any condition of Employment, that He would join with Them in any Act, to make him utterly Incapable of ever bearing Office, or having any other Employment in any of his Ma∣jesty's Dominions;</Q> which he hoped would Satisfy them.</P>
<P>THIS Advice, upon the Confidence of the giver, the King resolv'd to follow: But when his Resolution was imparted to the Earl, He im∣mediately sent his Brother to him, beseeching his Majesty <Q>“”by no means to take that way, for that he was most assured it would prove very Pernicious to him; and therefore desired, he might depend upon the Honour and Conscience of the Peers, without his Majesty▪s in∣terposition. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> The King told his Brother, "that he had taken that Re∣solution by the Advice of his Best Friends; but since he liked it not, he would decline it.</Q> The next morning the Lord <HI>Say</HI> came again

to him, and finding his Majesty alter'd in his Intention, told him, <Q>“”If he took that course He advised him, he was sure it would prevail; but if he declined it, He could not promise his Majesty what would be the issue, and should hold himself absolutely disengaged from any un∣dertaking.</Q> The King observing his Positiveness, and conceiving his Intentions to be very Sincere, suffer'd himself to be guided by him; and went immediately to the House, and said as the other had advised. Whether that Lord did Intruth believe, the discovery of his Majesty's Conscience in That manner, would produce the Effect he foretold; or <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> whether he advised it Treacherously, to bring on those Inconveniences which afterwards happen'd; I know not: But Many who believ'd his Will to be much Worse than his Understanding, had the Uncharitable∣ness to think, that he intended to Betray his Master, and to put the Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of the Earl out of question.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tumults about the House of Peers.</NOTE> THE Event proved very Fatal; for the King no sooner return'd from the House, than the House of Commons, in great Passion and Fury, de∣clared this last act of his Majesty's, to be <Q>“”the most unparallel'd Breach of Priviledge, that had ever happen'd; That if his Majesty might take notice what Bills were passing in either House, and declare His <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Own opinion, it was to forejudge Their Counsels, and they should not be able to supply the Common-wealth with wholesom Laws, suit∣able to the Diseases it labour'd under; That This was the greatest Ob∣struction of Justice, that could be imagin'd; That They, and Whoso∣ever had taken the late Protestation, were bound to maintain the Pri∣viledges of Parliament, which were now too grossly Invaded and Violated:</Q> with many Sharp Discourses to that purpose.</P>
<P>THE next day, great multitudes of People came down to <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI> and crowded about the House of Peers, exclaiming with great Outcries, "that they would have Justice; and publickly reading the <MILESTONE N="3$" UNIT="line"/> Names of those who had dissented from that Bill in the House of Com∣mons, as Enemies to their Country; and as any Lord pass'd by, call'd <HI>Justice, Justice;</HI> and with great Rudeness and Insolence, pressing upon, and thrusting, those Lords whom they suspected not to favour that Bill; professing aloud, <Q>“”That they would be govern'd and disposed by the Honourable House of Commons, and would defend Their Privi∣ledges according to their late Protestation.</Q> These unheard of acts of Insolence and Sedition continued so many days, till many Lords grew so really apprehensive of having their Brains beaten out, that they ab∣sented themselves from the House; and Others, finding what Seconds <MILESTONE N="4$" UNIT="line"/> the House of Commons was like to have to compass whatever they de∣sired, changed their minds; and so in an afternoon, when of the Four∣score<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill of Attainder Pass'd the House of Lords.</NOTE> who had been present at the Trial, there were only Six and Forty Lords in the House (the good People still crying at the doors for Ju∣stice) they put the Bill to the question, and Eleven Lords only dissent∣ing, it Pass'd that House, and was ready for the King's assent.</P>
<P>THE King continued as Resolved as ever, Not to give his consent. The same Oratory then attended Him at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> which had pre∣vail'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tumults about <HI>White-Hall</HI></NOTE> at <HI>Westminster;</HI> and a Rabble of many Thousand people besieged that place, crying out, <HI>Justice, Justice; that they would have Justice;</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> not without great and insolent Threats and Expressions, what They would do if it were not speedily granted. The Privy-Council was call'd together, to advise what course was to be taken to Suppress these Trai∣terous Riots. Instead of considering how to Rescue their Master's Ho∣nour
<PB N="202" REF="2240"/>
and his Conscience from this Infamous Violence and Constraint,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Privy-Council and some of the Bishops ad∣vise the King to Pass the Bill.</NOTE> They press the King to Pass the Bill of Attainder, saying, <Q>“”there was no other way to preserve Himself and his Posterity than by so doing; and therefore that He ought to be more tender of the Safety of the Kingdom,</Q> than of any One Person how Innocent soever: not one Counsellor interposing his opinion, to support his Master's Magnanimi∣ty and Innocence; They who were of that mind, either Suppressing their Thoughts through Fear, upon the new Doctrine establish'd then by the new Counsellors, <Q>“”that no man ought to presume to advise any thing in That place,</Q> contrary to the sense of Both Houses; Others sad∣ly <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> believing, the Force and Violence offer'd to the King, would be, be∣fore God and man, a Just Excuse for whatsoever he should do,</P>
<P>HIS Majesty told them, <Q>“”that what had been proposed to him to do, was directly contrary to his Conscience, and that being so, he was sure they would not perswade him to it, though Themselves were ne∣ver so well satisfied. To that point, they desired him, "to confer with his Bishops, who, they made no question, would better inform his Conscience.</Q> The Arch-Bishop of <HI>York</HI> was at hand; who, to his Argu∣ment of Conscience, told him, <Q>“”That there was a Private and a Pub∣lick Conscience; that his Publick Conscience as a King, might not on∣ly <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> dispense with, but oblige him, to do that which was against his Private Conscience as a Man: and that the Question was not, Whether He should Save the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> but, Whether he should Perish with him: That the Conscience of a King to preserve his Kingdom, the Conscience of a Husband to preserve his Wife, the Conscience of a Father to preserve his Children (all which were now in danger) weigh'd down abundantly all the considerations, the Conscience of a Master, or a Friend could suggest to him, for the preservation of a Friend, or Servant.</Q> And by such Unprelatical, Ignominious Arguments, in plain terms advised him, "even for Conscience sake, to Pass that Act. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THOUGH this Bishop acted His part with more prodigious Boldness and Impiety, Others of the same Function (for whose Learning and Sin∣cerity the King and the World had greater reverence) did not what might have been expected from their Calling or their Trust; but at least forbore to Fortify and Confirm a Conscience, upon the Courage and Piety of which, the Security of their Persons and their Order, did ab∣solutely, under God, depend.</P>
<P>DURING these Perplexities, the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> taking notice of the Straits the King was in, the Rage of the People still increasing (from whence he might expect a certain Outrage and Ruin, how constant so∣ever <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the King continued to him; and it may be, knowing of an Under∣taking (for such an Undertaking there was) by a great Person, who had then a Command in the Tower, <Q>“”that if the King refused to Pass the Bill,</Q> to free the Kingdom from the hazard it seem'd to be in, He<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> him∣self writes to his Majesty to Pass it</NOTE> would cause his Head to be stricken off in the Tower) writ a most pa∣thetical Letter to the King, full of acknowledgment of his Favours; but lively representing <Q>“”the Dangers, which threatned Himself and his Posterity,</Q> by the King's persevering in those Favours; and therefore by many Arguments conjuring him, <Q>“”no longer to defer his Affent to the Bill, that so His Death might free the Kingdom from the many <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Troubles it apprehended.</Q></P>
<P>THE delivery of this Letter being quickly known, new Arguments were applied; <Q>“”that this free consent of his Own, clearly absolv'd the
<PB N="203" REF="2250"/>
King from any scruple that could remain with him;</Q> and so in the end<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King signs a Com∣mission for the Passing it.</NOTE> they extorted from him, to sign a Commission to some Lords to Pass the Bill: which was as valid as if he had pass'd it himself; though they comforted him even with That circumstance, <Q>“”that His Own hand was not in it.</Q></P>
<P>IT may easily be said, that the Freedom of the Parliament, and His own Negative voice, being thus Barbarously invaded, if his Majesty had, instead of Passing that Act, come to the House and Dissolv'd the Par∣liament; or if he had withdrawn himself from that Seditious City, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> put himself in the head of his own Army; much of the Mischief, which hath Since happen'd, would have been prevented. But whoever truly considers the state of Affairs at that time; the Prevalency of that Fa∣ction in Both Houses; the Rage and Fury of the People; the Use that was made by the Schismatical Preachers (by whom the Orthodox were generally silenced) of the late Protestation, in their Pulpits; the Fears and Jealousies They had infused into the minds of many sober men, upon the discourse of the late Plot; the Constitution of the Council-Table, that there was scarce and Honest man durst speak his Conscience to the King, for fear of his Ruin; and that those whom he thought most <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> True to him, Betray'd him every hour, insomuch as his Whispers in his Bed-chamber were instantly convey'd to Those against whom those whispers were; so that he had very Few men to whom he could breath his Conscience and Complaints, that were not Suborn'd against him, or Averse to his opinions: That on the other side, if some Expedient were not speedily found out, to Allay that Frantick Rage and Combina∣tion in the People, there was reason enough to believe, their Impious hands would be lifted up against his own Person, and (which He much more apprehended) against the person of his Royal Consort: and last∣ly, that (besides the difficulty of getting thither) he had no ground to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> be very confident of his own Army: I say, Whoever sadly Contemplates this, will find cause to confess, the Part which the King had to act, was not only harder than any Prince, but than any Private Gentleman had been exposed to; and that it is much easier, upon the Accidents and Occurrences which have Since happen'd, to determine what was Not to have been done, than at That time to have Foreseen, by what means to have Freed himself from the Labyrinth in which he was involv'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl Be∣headed, <HI>May</HI> the 12<SUP>th</SUP> <HI>1641.</HI></NOTE> ALL things being thus transacted; to conclude the Fate of this great Person, He was on the Twelfth day of <HI>May</HI> brought from the Tower of <HI>London</HI> (where he had been a Prisoner near six Months) to the Scaf∣fold <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> on Tower-Hill; where, with a composed, undaunted Courage, he told the People, <Q>“”He was come thither to Satisfy them with his Head; but that he much fear'd, the Reformation which was begun in Blood, would not prove so Fortunate to the Kingdom, as They expected, and He wish'd: and after great expressions "of his Devotion to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Protestant Religion established by Law, and profess'd in that Church; of his Loyalty to the King, and Affection to the Peace and Welfare of the Kingdom;</Q> with marvellous Tran∣quillity of mind, he deliver'd his Head to the Block, where it was sever'd from his Body at a Blow.

<P>THUS Fell the Greatest Subject in Power, and little inferior to any in Fortune, that was at that time in any of the Three Kingdoms; Who
<PB N="204" REF="2260"/>
could well remember the time, when He Led those People, who then Parsued Him to his Grave. He was a man of great Parts, and extraor∣dinary Endowments of Nature; not unadorn d with some addition of Art and Learning, though that again was more improved and illustrated by the other; for he had a readiness of Conception, and sharpness of Expression, which made his Learning thought more than intruth it was. His first inclinations and addresses to the Court, were only to establish his Greatness in the Country; where he apprehended some acts of Power from the Lord <HI>Savile,</HI> who had been his Rival allways There, and of late had strengthen▪d himself, by being made a Privy-Counsellor, and Of∣ficer <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> at Court: but his first attempts were so prosperous, that He con∣tented not himself with being secure from that Lord's power in the Country, but rested not, till he had bereav'd his adversary of all power and place in Court; and so sent him down, a most Abject, Disconsolate old man, to his Country, where He was to have the Superintendency over him too, by getting himself at that time made Lord President of the North. These Successes, applied to a nature too Elate and Haughty of it self; and a quicker progress into the greatest Employments and Trust; made him more transported with Disdain of other men, and more Contemning the Forms of business, than happily he would have been, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> it he had met with some Interruptions in the beginning; and had pass'd in a more leisurely gradation to the office of a States-man.</P>
<P>HE was no doubt of great observation, and a piercing judgement, both in Things, and Persons; but this too good skill in Persons, made him judge the worse of Things: for it was his Misfortune, to be in a time wherein very few Wise men were equally employ'd with him; and scarce any (but the Lord <HI>Coventry,</HI> whose Trust was more confined) whose Faculties and Abilities were equal to His: So that upon the matter he relied wholely upon Himself; and discerning many Defects in most men, he too much neglected what they said or did. Of all his Passions, his <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Pride was most predominant: which a moderate exercise of Ill Fortune might have corrected and reform'd; and which was by the hand of Heaven strangely Punish'd, by bringing his Destruction upon him by Two things that he most despised, the People and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane.</HI> In a word, the Epitaph which <HI>Plutarch</HI> records that <HI>Sylla</HI> wrote for him∣self, may not be unfitly applied to him, <Q>“”That no man did ever exceed him, either in doing Good to his Friends, or in doing Mischief to his Enemies;</Q> for his acts of both kinds were most notorious.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">At the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> TOGETHER with that of Attainder of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> another Bill was Pass'd by the King, of allmost as Fatal a Consequence both <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to the King and Kingdom, as that was to the Earl, <Q>“”the Act for the Per∣petual Parliament;</Q> as it is since call'd.</P>
<P>THE vast Charge of the two Armies, was no other way supplied (for I have told you before the reason why they were so slow in granting of Subsidies) than by borrowing great Sums of money from the City or Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> upon the Credit of Particular persons. The Emis∣saries in that Negotiation, about the time the Act of Attainder pass'd the Commons, return'd, <Q>“”That there was no more hope of Borrowing in the City; that men had Before chearfully lent their Estates, upon their confidence in the Honour and Justice of the two Houses; but <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> they had Now consider'd, how desperate that Security must prove, if the two Houses should be Dissolv'd.</Q> Which consideration, begun to have an universal Influence upon all Those who were Personally Bound

for moneys already borrow'd; <Q>“”for that Their Persons and Fortunes must answer those Sums which had been paid for the Publick be∣nefit, if the Parliament should be Dissolv'd before any Act pass▪d for their Security. That their Fears and Apprehensions that this might happen, were much advanced by the late discovery of the Plot against the Parliament; for though the particulars thereof were not yet pub∣lish'd, they discern'd there was not that good meaning to the Parlia∣ment, as it deserv'd.</Q> This was no sooner offer'd, than the Reasonable∣ness of the objection was enforc'd; and the Necessity of finding some <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Expedient <Q>“”to Satisfy the People of the gracious Intention and Resolu∣tions of the King;</Q> which were most unquestionable (for in all those articles of time, when They were to demand some unreasonable thing from him, they spared no dutiful mention of the Piety and Goodness of his own Princely nature; or large promises what demonstrations of Duty they would shortly make to him) No way could be thought of so sure, as an Act of Parliament, <Q>“”that This Parliament should not be Ad∣journ'd, Prorogued, or Dissolv'd, but by Act of Parliament; which, upon this occasion,</Q> his Majesty would never deny to Pass.</P>
<P>IT is not credible, what an universal reception and concurrence this <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Motion met with (which was to remove the Landmarks, and to de∣stroy the Foundation of the Kingdom) insomuch, as a Committee was immediately appointed to withdraw, and to prepare a short Bill to that purpose; which was within a short time (less than an Hour) brought into the House, and immediately Twice read, and Committed; an ex∣pedition scarce ever heard of before in Parliament; and the next day, with as little agitation, and the contradiction of very few voices, In∣gross'd, and carried up to the Lords: with them it had some Debate, and Amendments, which were deliver'd at a Conference, the principal whereof was, that the time should be limited and not left indefinite, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”and that it should not be Dissolv'd within two years, except by con∣sent of Both Houses;</Q> that time being sufficient to provide against any accidents that were then apprehended.</P>
<P>THESE Alterations were highly resented in the House of Commons, as argument of Jealousy between the King and the Parliament, <Q>“”that it should be imaginable the Members of both Houses, who resided from their houses and conveniences at great charge for the service of the Publick, would desire to continue longer together than the necessity of that Service should require; without considering, that it was more unlikely that the King (who had condescended so far to them, and had <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> yet intruth receiv'd no fruit from their meeting) would Dissolve them, as long as they intended that for which they were summon'd toge∣ther, and contain'd themselves within the bounds of Duty and Mo∣deration.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the Commons stoutly insisted on their own Bill; and the Lords, in that hurry of Noise and Confusion, when the meetings of the Peo∣ple were so frequent, kindly Consented likewise to it: and so, by the unportunity, and upon the undertaking of persons He then most trusted, in the agony of the other dispatch, the King was induced to include that Bill in the Commission with the Act of Attainder, and they were <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Both Pass'd together.</P>
<P>AFTER the Passing these two Bills, the temper and spirit of the Peo∣ple, both within and without the walls of the two Houses, grew mar∣vellous calm and composed; there being likewise, about that time, Pass'd
<PB N="206" REF="2280"/>
by the King, the two Bills, for the taking away the Star-chamber Court, and the High Commission: So that there was not a Grievance or In∣convenience, Real or Imaginary, to which there was not a through Re∣medy applied; and therefore all men expected, that both Armies would be speedily Disbanded; and such returns of Duty and Acknowledgment be made to the King, as might be agreeable to Their professions, and to the Royal Favours he had vouchsafed to his People.</P>
<P>BUT what provisions so ever were made for the Publick, Particular persons had receiv'd no satisfaction. The Death of the Earl of <HI>Bedford;</HI> and the high Proceedings in all those cases in which the King was most <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> concern'd; left all Those who expected Offices and Preferments, desperate in their hopes: And yet an Accident happen'd, that might have been look'd upon as an Earnest or Instance of some encouragement that way.</P>
<P>BESIDES the Lord <HI>Say</HI>'s being invested in the Mastership of the Wards, in the place of the Lord <HI>Cottington</HI> (who was every day threatned, upon the Secretary's Paper of Results, to be accused of High Treason, till, like a wise man, he retired from the Offices which begot his trou∣ble; and for a long time after, till he again embark'd himself in Publick employments, enjoy'd himself without the least disturbance) At a Com∣mittee in the House of Lords, in the Afternoon, in some Debate, Pas∣sion <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> arose between the Earl of <HI>`Pembroke,</HI> who was then Lord'Chamber∣lain of the Houshold, and the Lord <HI>Mowbray,</HI> eldest Son of the Earl of <HI>Arundel;</HI> and from angry and disdainful Words, an offer or attempt of Blows was made; for which misdemeanour, they were the next day<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King takes the Staff of Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> and g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the Earl of Essex.</NOTE> Both sent to the Tower by the House of Lords.

<P>IT was thought this extraordinary grace to the most Popular person <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of the Kingdom, would have had a notable Influence upon the whole Party, which made Him believe it depended very much on Him: But it was so far from having That effect, as they look'd upon that favour, ra∣ther as a mark of Punishment and Revenge upon the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> for his affection to Them, and for giving his Suffrage against the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> (which he had often profess'd to the King he could never in Conscience do) than of Esteem and Kindness to the Earl of <HI>Essex;</HI> and so they were intruth more offended and incensed with the Disgrace and Disobligation to the One, than they were pleased with the Prefer∣ment of the Other: therefore whatever concern'd the King in Right; or <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> what he might naturally expect from the compliance and affection of the House; or what was any way recommended by his Majesty to them, found little or no Respect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The truth of the case of Tonnage and Poundage.</NOTE> HIS Revenue was so far from being advanced (as had been gloriously promised) that it was, both in dignity and value, much lessen'd from what it was: For shortly after the beginning of the Parliament, great Complaint had been made, <Q>“”that Tonnage and Poundage (which is the duty and subsidy paid by the Merchant upon Trade) had been taken by the King without consent of Parliament; the case whereof intruth is this: This Duty had been constantly given</Q> to the Succeeding King, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> ever since the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, for his Life, in the First Parliament they held after their coming to the Crown: Before that time, it had been granted for Years; and was originally intended for the
<PB N="207" REF="2290"/>
support of the Navy, whereby the Merchant might be freed from dan∣ger of Pirates; and upon the death of every King since that time, his Successor commonly receiv'd it, without the least interruption, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l the next Parliament; in the beginning whereof it was allways without scru∣ple granted: So that, though it was, and must allways be acknowledg'd as the free gift of the People (as all other Subsidies are) yet it was look'd upon as so Essential a part of the Revenue of the Crown, that it could not be without it: and as the King is not less King Before his Co∣ronation than he is After, so this Duty had been still enjoy'd as freely <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Before, as it was After an Act of Parliament to that purpose; neither had there been ever any Exception taken in Parliament (which sometimes was not in a year after the death of the former King) that the Crown had continued the receipt of it; which it did, till the time of a new Grant.</P>
<P>THUS, after the death of King <HI>James,</HI> his Majesty receiv'd it, till the First Parliament was Summon'd; and, That and Two more being un∣fortunately Dissolv'd (as was said before) in which his Ministers were not sollicitous enough for the passing that Act for Tonnage and Poun∣dage, continued the receipt of it till this present Parliament; Then (that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> is, many weeks after the beginning of it) it was directed, <Q>“”that a Bill should be speedily prepared for the granting it, as had been usual, lest the Crown might, by so long enjoying, in a manner prescribe to it of Right,</Q> without the donation of the People; which the King allways disclaim'd to do. Shortly after (no man presuming to intimate, that it should be granted in any other manner than of course it had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een) it was alledg'd, <Q>“”that the Bill could not be so speedily prepared as were to be wish'd, by reason that there were many just Exceptions made by the Merchants to the Book of Rates, which had been lately made by the Farmers of the Customs, in the time and by the direction of the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Earl of <HI>Portland</HI> (Circumstances that carried Prejudice enough to whatsoever they were applied)</Q> and therefore it was proposed, for the present, as the best expedient to continue his Majesty's Supply, and to preserve the Right of giving in the People, <Q>“”that a Temporary Bill should pass, for the granting the same to his Majesty for two Months only, in which time a new Book of Rates should be made, more ad∣vantagious to his Majesty in point of profit (which was allways pro∣fess'd) "and then a Compleat Act might pass.</Q></P>
<P>TO this purpose a Bill was accordingly brought in, the Preamble whereof <Q>“”renounced and declared, against not only any Power in the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Crown of levying the Duty of Tonnage and Poundage, without the express consent of Parliament, but also any power of Imposition upon any Merchandizes whatsoever,</Q> and in any case whatsoever; which had been constantly practised in the best times by the Crown; had the countenance of a solemn judgment in the Exchequer-Chamber; and though often agitated in Parliament, had never been Yet declared against: Yet This quietly pass'd Both Houses, as a thing not worth considering. And so in expectation and confidence, that they would make glorious Additions to the State and Revenue of the Crown, his Majesty suffer'd himself to be Stripp'd of All that he had left; and of the sole stock of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Credit he had to Borrow moneys upon: for though intruth, men knew That Revenue was not Legally vested in the King till an Act of Parlia∣ment, yet all men look'd upon it as unquestionable to Pass; and so it was not only a competent proportion for the present support of his House,

But This was no sooner moved, <Q>“”as Seasonable in order to Their Own professions, and <MILESTONE N="1$" UNIT="line"/> in a degree Due to the King, after so many reiterated expressions of Favour and Affection to his People, by so many excellent Laws, and other Condescensions; Than They objected, "the Odiousness of the late Plot against the Parliament, which was not yet fully discover'd: That notwithstanding those gracious demonstrations of Favour from the King, in the Laws and other acts mention'd, They had great cause to apprehend, some Ill affected persons had still an Influence upon his Majesty, to the Disservice of the Parliament, and to beget Jealousies in Him towards them; for that they had plainly discover'd (which they should in a short time be able to present fully to the House) that <MILESTONE N="2$" UNIT="line"/> there had been a Design, not only to Poyson the Affections of the Army towards the Parliament, by making them believe that They were reglected, and the <HI>Scots</HI> preferr'd much before them; but to bring up that Army to <HI>London,</HI> with a purpose to AW the Parliament: That there was a resolution to Seize the Tower, and to make it a Curb upon the City: That there had been an attempt to prevail with the Officers of the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army, at least to Sit still as Neuters, whilst the Others acted this Tragedy: That the Confederates in this design had taken an Oath, to Oppose any course that should be advised for the Re∣moving the Bishops out of the House of Peers; to Preserve and De∣fend <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the King's Prerogative, to the utmost extent that any of his Pro∣genitors had enjoy'd; and to Settle his Majesty's Revenue: That They had reason to fear, his Majesty's own Concurrence, at least his Ap∣probation, in this design (which, if not prevented, must have proved so Pernicious and Fatal to the Kingdom) for that, besides that the Per∣sons principally engaged in it, were of the nearest Trust about the King and Queen▪ They had clear Proof, that a Paper had pass'd his Maje∣sty's perusal, in which were contain'd, many sharp Invectives against the Parliament; a desire that they might have the exercise of Martial Law the mention whereof,</Q> was the most Unpopular and Odious thing <MILESTONE N="4$" UNIT="line"/> that could be imagin'd) <Q>“”and an offer of Service to Defend his Maje∣sty's person, which was an implication as if it had been in Danger: and that this Paper should have been Sign'd by All the Officers of the Ar∣my; for their better encouragement wherein, the King himself had written a <HI>C.</HI></Q> and an <HI>R.</HI> as a testimony that He approved of it.</P>
<P>THIS Discourse, so Methodically and Confidently averr'd, made a strange Impression (without reserving themselves till the Evidence should be produced) in the minds of most men; who believ'd, that such Particulars could never have been with that Solemnity inform'd, if the Proofs were not very clear; and serv'd, not only to Blast whatsoever <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> was moved on his Majesty's behalf, but to Discountenance, what, till then, had been the most Popular motion that could be made, which was, the Disbanding both Armies, and the <HI>Scots</HI> return into their own Country.

<P>AFTER that act, the King might have been reasonably awaked, from any extraordinary confidence in the Loyalty, Honour, or Justice, of Both Houses. And without doubt, when Posterity shall recover the Cou∣rage, and Conscience, and the old Honour, of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, it will <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="line"/> not with more Indignation and Blushes contemplate any action of this Seditious and Rebellious age, than that the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> who were not guilty of the Treason, should recompense an In∣vasion from a Forreign Nation, with whatever Establishments They pro∣posed in their own Kingdom, and with a Donative of Three Hundred Thousand pounds, over and above all Charges, out of the bowels of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> which will yet appear the more prodigious, when it shall be con∣sider▪d, that not a Fifth part of those who were Accessaries to that In∣famous Prodigality, were either Favourers of Their Ends, or great Well∣wishers to their Nation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="$0" UNIT="line"/> BUT very Many gave themselves leave, Unfaithfully, to be Absent from those Debates, when the Wealth and Honour of their Country was to be transplanted into a strange Land; Others look'd upon it as a good Purchase, to be Freed of the payment of Fourscore thousand pounds the month (which was the charge of Both Armies) by an entire Sum of three hundred thousand pounds; and Some pleased themselves with an assurance, that the Scandal, and Unreasonableness of the Sum, would provoke the People to a Hatred and Revenge, and so that the Brother∣hood would not be Supported, but Destroy'd by that extravagant Boun∣ty: Yet these were only short Ejaculations to Please themselves for <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> the time; for many of those, who had no other reason to consent to that vast Sum but that they might be rid of them, were so inflamed and transported with the Tale of the Plot, that they had Then no mind to let them go; and had so far swallow'd and digested an assurance that it was True, that they reserv'd no Distinguishing or Judging faculties for the time when the Evidence and Proof should be presented to them.</P>
<P>AFTER they had play'd with this Plot, and given the House heats and colds, by applying Parts of it to them upon emergent occasions, for the space of near three months; and finding, that though it did them <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> many notable Services, in advancing Their Own Reputations, and Ca∣lumniating the King's Honour, yet, that it had not a Through Effect at Court for their Preferment; They resolv'd to shew All their Ware, and to produce the Whole Evidence: for the perfecting whereof, they had <Q>“”a late mark of God's great favour towards them, in his furnishing them with Evidence for the compleat Discovery of the whole mis∣chief, from one that was a principal Contriver of it.</Q></P>
<P>WE said before, <Q>“”that upon the first motion in the House of Com∣mons, by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym,</HI> for a Committee of Examination, and for an Ad∣dress to the King, that he would grant no Passes to any of his Servants <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to go beyond Seas, some Persons, of near relation to his Trust, im∣mediately absented themselves;</Q> which were M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Peircy,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jer∣myn:</HI> now the latter of these, without interruption, transported himself into <HI>France;</HI> but M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Peircy,</HI> delaying his journey upon some occasions

<P>IT was generally believ'd afterwards, that finding the Sea-Ports shut, and Watches set for his apprehension in all those places, whereby the Transporting himself into Forreign Parts was very difficult, he found means to return to <HI>London,</HI> and to put himself into his Brother's Pro∣tection; where it is thought he was harbour'd, till his hurt was cured; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the strictness of the enquiry, over; and, till he had prepared that Letter to his Brother, the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> which serv'd, as far as in Him lay, to destroy all his Companions, and furnish'd the Commit∣tee, with that which They call'd "a Double Evidence: for They had no sooner receiv▪d that Letter from the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> than they told the House, "They were Now Ready for a compleat Discovery; and thereupon, produced the Evidence of Colonel <HI>Goring,</HI> and the Letter from M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Peircy;</HI> both which agreed upon the relation, <Q>“”of a meeting at M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Peircy</HI>'s Chamber; and of a discourse of the Parliament's Neglect of the King's, and Favouring the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army; the taking an Oath <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of Secrecy;</Q> and some other particulars: all which had been positive∣ly Denied, by those of them that were Members of the House of Com∣mons, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Wilmot,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pollard,</HI> upon their Exa∣minations upon Oath.</P>
<P>IT will hardly be believ'd hereafter (but that the Effects of such Im∣postures have left such deep Marks) that the Evidence Then given, could, in so Grave and Judging an Assembly, as a High Court of Parlia∣ment, till then, had allways been, have brought the least Prejudice upon the King: or indeed, Damage to any person accused: there being, in all the Testimonies produced, so little shew of Proof, of a Real Design, or <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Plot, to bring up the Army (which was the chief matter alledg'd) to Aw the Parliament, that intruth it was very evident, there was No Plot at all; Only a Free Communication between persons (the major part whereof were of the House) <Q>“”of the Ill Arts that were generally used to Corrupt the Affections of the People; and of some Expedient, where by,</Q> in that so publick Infection, the Army (in which they had all con∣siderable Commands, two of them being General Officers) "might be "preserv'd from being wrought upon and corrupted: in which discourse, Colonel <HI>Goring</HI> himself, as appear▪d by his own Examination, only pro∣posed wild and extravagant overtures, <Q>“”of bringing up the Army, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> surprizing the Tower; which was, by all the rest, with manifest dis∣like, rejected: That all this had pass'd at one meeting, in which, They who met were so ill satisfied in one another, that they never would come together again: That when the bringing up the Army to <HI>Lon∣don</HI> was once talk'd of before the King, his Majesty would not hear of it, but only desired, That, their Affections might be kept entire for his Service, as far as was consistent with the Laws of the Land, which were in danger to be invaded.</Q></P>

So that this Plot serv'd, to produce their First Protestation; to inflame the People against the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and in a degree to compass Their Ends upon that great Person, as hath been before observ'd; to procure the Bill for the Continuance <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of This Parliament, the Foundation, or the Fountain, of all the Publick Calamities; to hinder and cross all overtures made for the Revenue of the King, and to lessen the general Reverence and Duty to Both their Majesties; to continue the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army within the Kingdom, and consequently, to hinder the King's from being Disbanded; to incense both Houses against the Bishops, as if the design had been principally for Their protection (there being one Witness who said, <Q>“”he had been told, that the Clergy would Raise and Pay one thousand Horse, to be employ'd against the Parliament)</Q> to blast the reputation of the Earl of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> whose zeal to his Majesty's Service was most remarkable, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> as if He had been to have Commanded the Army; and lastly, to ad∣vance Their own Credit and Estimation with the People, as if They were the only Patriots, that intended the Preservation of Religion, Law, and Liberty.</P>
<P>AND having made this use of it (which is a sufficient argument what opinion they had of Their Own evidence) They never Proceeded a∣gainst any of the Persons who were in their power, though they patient∣ly attended and importuned a Trial above a year after their accusa∣tion: for They well knew, there must be Then a more Exact and Strict weighing of the Proofs; and that the Persons accused, would not on∣ly <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Vindicate Themselves from the aspersions which were laid upon them, but could Recriminate upon the principal Prosecutors with such charges, as they would not so easily be freed from; and this was the reason, that, even during the heat and noise of the Accusation, They receiv'd very civil offices, visits, and addresses, from the Chief of Those who were trusted with the Prosecution.</P>
<P>THE sending that Letter of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Peircy</HI>'s to the House of Commons; or rather, the procuring that Letter to be writ (in which, such Insinua∣tions were made, to the Prejudice of the King and Queen) was the first visible instance of the Defection of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> from his Majesty's Service; which wrought several Ill Effects in the minds of many: For, as the Earl then had the most Esteem'd and Un∣blemish'd Reputation, in Court and Country, of any person of his rank throughout the Kingdom; So They who knew him well, discern'd,
<PB N="212" REF="2340"/>
that the greatness of that Reputation, was but an effect of the singu∣lar Grace and Favour shew'd to him by his Majesty; who, immediate∣ly upon the death of his Father, had taken this Earl (being then less than Thirty years of age) into His immediate and eminent care; first made him a Privy-Counsellor; then Knight of the Order of the Gar∣ter; then (that he might fit him by degrees for the greatest Trust and Employments sent him Admiral into the Narrow Seas, of a Royal Navy; and after a Summer spent in that exercise▪ made him Lord high Admiral of <HI>England;</HI> and to the very minute of which we speak, pro∣secuted him with all manner and demonstration of Respect and Kind∣ness; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and (as I heard his Majesty himself say) <Q>“”courted him as his Mistress, and conversed with him as his Friend, without the least interruption or intermission of any possible favour and kindness.</Q> And therefore many, who observ▪d this great Earl purchase this opportu∣nity of Disserving the King, at the price of his Brother's honour, and of his Own gratitude, concluded, that he had some notable tempta∣tion in Conscience, and that the Court was much Worse than it was believ▪d to be.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that after his Brother▪s being accused of High Trea∣son; and then, upon his hurt in <HI>Sussex,</HI> coming directly to <HI>Northum∣berland</HI>-House <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to shelter himself; the Earl being in great trouble how to send him away beyond the Seas after his wound was cured, ad∣vised with a confident Friend then in Power, whose affection to him he doubted not, and who, innocently enough, brought M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> into the Council, who over-witted them Both, by frankly consenting, <Q>“”that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Peircy</HI> should escape into <HI>France,</HI></Q> which was all the care the Earl had; but then obliged him, <Q>“”First to draw such a Letter from him, as might by the Party be applied as an Evidence of the rea∣lity of the Plot,</Q> after he was escaped; and in this manner the Let∣ter was procured; which made a lasting Quarrel between the two Bro∣thers; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and made the Earl more at the Disposal of Those persons whom he had trusted so far, than he had been before.</P>
<P>AFTER the Act for the Continuance of the Parliament, the House of Commons took much more upon them, in point of their Privi∣ledges, than they had done; and more undervalued the concurrence of the Peers; though that Act, neither Added any thing to, nor Ex∣tended their Jurisdiction: which Jurisdiction, the Wisdom of Former times kept from being Limited or Defined; there being Then no dan∣ger of Excess; and it being much more agreeable to the nature of the Supream Court to have an Unlimited Jurisdiction. But Now, that <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> they could not be Dissolv'd without Their Own consent (the Appre∣hension and Fear whereof, had allways Before kept them within some bounds of Modesty) they call▪d any Power they pleased to assume to Themselves, "a Branch of their Priviledge; and any Opposing or Que∣stioning that Power, "a Breach of their Priviledges: which all men were bound to Defend by Their late Protestation; and They were the Only Proper Judges of Their Own Priviledges.</P>
<P>HEREuPON, They call▪d whom they pleased, <HI>Delinquents;</HI> receiv'd Complaints of all kinds; and committed to Prison whom they pleased: which had been never done, nor attempted, before This Parliament; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> except in some such apparent Breach, as the Arresting a Priviledg'd person, or the like. And, as if Theirs had swallow'd up all other Pri∣viledges, of Peers, and the King himself, upon the Lords rejecting a
<PB N="213" REF="2350"/>
Bill sent up to them, "to compell all persons (without distinction of Quality; and without distinction of Punishment or Proceeding, upon their refusal) "to take the late Protestation; and two Lords of great credit (the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Roberts)</HI> having re∣fused to take the same; the House of Commons in great Fury, and with many expressions of Contempt, by a Vote declared, <Q>“”that the Protestation made by Them, was fit to be taken by every person that was well affected in Religion, and to the good of the Common-wealth; and therefore, that what person soever should not take the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Protestation,</Q> was unfit to bear Office in the Church or Common-wealth; and directed farther, <Q>“”that that Vote should be Printed, and that the Knights and Burgesses should send down Copies of it, to the several Places for which they serv'd:</Q> which was the most unparal∣lel'd Breach of Priviledge; and the highest and most insolent Affront, to the Lords, to the King, and to the Justice of the Kingdom; and the most Destructive to Parliaments, that any Age had been guilty of. And yet, when some of the Peers nobly resented it, on the behalf of the Peerage and the Liberty of the Subject, and press'd resolutely for Reparation, means was found out, to engage the King to inter∣pose <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="line"/> his Royal mediation with those Lords, to the end, they might quietly pass by that publick Violation and Indignity, without further insisting on it.</P>
<P>ALL this time the two Armies were continued at a vast Charge, many men whispering (but so that it might be spoken of) <Q>“”that the <HI>Scots</HI> would not retire,</Q> till the Bill against Episcopacy was pass'd: Whereupon, the King sent them word, about the beginning of <HI>July,</HI> <Q>“”that he desired all speed might be used for the Disbanding both Ar∣mies; for the better, and more orderly doing whereof, he had con∣stituted the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> General of his Army (the Earl of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Northumberland,</HI> by reason of his Indisposition in health, or some other reason, having laid down his Commission) and intended forth∣with to send him down thither: That his Majesty himself, accord∣ing to a former Resolution, and Promise made to his Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> meant to visit that his native Kingdom, for the better per∣fecting the Peace there; and appointed the day (about fourteen days after) he resolv'd to begin his Progress; and therefore wish'd them, against that time, to Prepare and Finish any such Acts, as they de∣sired might receive his Majesty's Approbation, for the good of the Kingdom, if there yet remain'd any thing to be ask'd of him.</Q> Not∣withstanding <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> which message, they spent most of their time upon the Bill for extirpation of Bishops, Deans, and Chapters; without either finishing the Act of Pacification between the two Nations, or giving order for the Disbanding the Army.</P>
<P>IT was wonder'd at by many, and sure was a great Misfortune to the King, that he chose not rather, at that time ▪though the business was only to Disband) to constitute the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> General of his Army, than the Earl of <HI>Holland;</HI> for (besides that it would have been an act of much more grace and satisfaction to the People, and to the Soldiery) his Majesty having lately given him so great an earnest of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> his trust, as the making him Chamberlain of his House, he ought in Policy to have pursued that work, by any seasonable accumulation of Favour, till he had made him his perfect Creature; which had been very easy, if skilfully attempted: for his Pride and Ambition, which
<PB N="214" REF="2360"/>
were not accompanied with any habit of Ill Nature▪ were very capable of Obligations; and he had a Faithfulness and Constancy in his na∣ture, which had kept him allways Religious in matter of trust; Then, he was allmost a declared Enemy to the <HI>Scotish</HI> Nation; and would have been very Punctual in all Formalities and Decencies, which had any relation to his Master's Honour, or the Honour of the Nation.

<P>WHEREAS, by making the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> General, his Majesty much Disobliged the Other, who expected it, and to whom it had been in a manner offer'd; and made him apprehend some Distrust in the King towards him; and that his former Favour in his Office had been conferr'd on him, rather because no man else had been able to bear the Envy of Displacing the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> than that his Own Merit and Service was valued. Besides, the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> upon whom he conferr'd that Honour, had formerly disappointed him, and of en in∣curr'd his displeasure; and wore some marks of it; and was of no other Interest or Reputation with the Party which could do mischief, than <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> as a person Obnoxious to them, in the misexecuting his great and ter∣rible Office of Chief Justice in Eyre, by which he had vex'd and op∣press'd most Counties in <HI>England,</HI> and the most Considerable persons in those Counties; and in other particulars; that they knew he durst not offend them, and would purchase Their protection and good opinion at any price: As it fell out; for within few days after the King was gone through that Army, in his way to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Earl wrote a Let∣ter, which was communicated to both Houses, in which he mystical∣ly express'd <Q>“”some new Design to have been set on foot for Corrupting the Army;</Q> for which there was never after the least colour given; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> but serv'd them, to heighten the old Jealousies, and to bespeak a Mis∣understanding, for whatsoever should be proposed on his Majesty's be∣half during his absence.</P>
<P>MEN now believ'd, that they would be very forward in Dismissing the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army, and Disbanding the other, which cost the King∣dom so vast a Sum of money every month; and they had already voted a Brotherly assistance to the <HI>Scots</HI> of three hundred thousand pounds, for the Service They had perform'd; and an Act was already prepared for the raising the Sum: but They had yet no mind to part with their Beloved Brethren. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THE Commissioners who treated with the <HI>Scots,</HI> had agreed, <Q>“”that the King should be present in his Parliament in <HI>Edenborough,</HI> by such a day in <HI>July,</HI> to Pass the Act for Pacification between the two Kingdoms, and such other Acts as his Parliament there should pro∣pose to him;</Q> and his Majesty prepared to begin his Progress, soon enough to be in <HI>Scotland</HI> by the time; and they resolv'd on all sides, <Q>“”that the one Army should be drawn out of the Kingdom, and the other totally Disbanded, before the King should arrive in the Northern parts, for many reasons.</Q> As They had lost all confidence in the af∣fections of the <HI>English</HI> Army, so there were many Jealousies arisen a∣mong <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the <HI>Scots;</HI> both in their Army, and amongst their greatest Coun∣sellors: notwithstanding all which, instead of making hast to the Dis∣banding, They publish'd much Jealousy and Dissatisfaction to remain
<PB N="215" REF="2370"/>
with them, of the Court; <Q>“”There were some evil Counsellors still about the King, who obstructed many gracious acts, which would otherwise flow from his goodness and bounty towards his People; and made ill impressions in him,</Q> of the Parliament it self, and its prodeedings.</P>
<P>THEIR design was to remove the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> from the King; both because they had a mind to have his Office of Warden of the Cinque-Ports from him, that it might be conferr'd on the Earl of <HI>War∣wick;</HI> and as He was allmost the Only man of great Quality and Con∣sideration about the King, who did not in the least degree stoop, or <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> make court to them, but cross'd them boldly in the House; and all other ways pursued his Master's Service, with his utmost vigour and in∣tentness of mind: They could not charge him with any thing like a Crime, and therefore only intended by some Vote to Brand him, and make him Odious; by which they presumed, they should at last make him willing to ransom himself by quitting that Office: For which, there was some underhand treaty, by persons who were sollicitous to Prevent farther Inconveniences; and as they found any thing like to suc∣ceed in that, they slacken'd or advanced their discourse of Evil Coun∣sellors.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> ONE day they were very warm upon the Argument, and had a pur∣pose to have named Him directly, which they had hitherto forborn to do, when M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> stood up, and said, <Q>“”He did really believe that there yet remain'd some Evil Counsellors, who did much harm about the King; and that it would be much better to Name them, than to Amuse the House so often with the general mention of them, as if we were afraid to name them: He proposed, "that there might be a day appointed, on which, upon due reflections upon Those who had been most notorious in doing Mischief to the Publick, we might most probably find, Who they were who stood still in the same paths, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and might Name them accordingly; and that for His part, if a day were appointed for that discovery, He would be ready to name One, who, by all the marks we could judge by, and by his former course of life, might very reasonably be believ'd to be an Evil Coun∣sellor.</Q></P>
<P>THEY were exceedingly apprehensive that he meant the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton</HI> (who, for the reasons aforesaid, was very dear to them) that thenceforward, though they desisted not from prosecuting the Duke, till at last they had compell'd him to quit the Cinque-Ports to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> They no more urged the Discovery of Evil <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Counsellors. And all the Familiar Friends of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde,</HI> were impor∣tuned to move him, <Q>“”not to endeavour to do any Prejudice to the Mar∣quis of <HI>Hamilton;</HI></Q> and even the King himself, was prevail'd with to send to him to that purpose: So Industrious was that People, to Preserve Those, whom for private ends they desired to preserve, as well as to Destroy Those, who they desired should be destroy'd.</P>

<P>THE First day the Committee sate full seven hours, <Q>and determin'd “”that every day, assoon as the House was resumed, the Chairman should report the several Votes of that day to the House, which should determine them before it rose;</Q> which was without any Precedent, and very Prejudicial to the grave transaction of the business: For, be∣sides that it was a Prejudging the House in its judgement, who, upon Report of the Committee, should have regard to the whole Bill in the Amendments made by them, which They were precluded from, by having confirm'd the several days Votes; It was so late every day before <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the House was resumed (the Speaker commonly leaving the Chair a∣bout nine of the Clock, and never resuming it till Four in the After∣noon) that it was very thin; They only, who prosecuted the Bill with impatience, remaining in the House, and the Others, who abhor'd it, growing weary of so tiresome an attendance, left the House at Din∣ner time, and afterwards follow'd their Pleasures: So that the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> was wont to say, <Q>“”that They who hated Bishops, hated them worse than the Devil, and that They who lov'd them, did not love them so well as their Dinner.</Q></P>
<P>HOWEVER, the Chairman gave some stop to their hast; For, besides <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that at the end of his report every day to the House, before the House put the Question for the concurrence in the Votes, He allways en∣larged himself against every one of them, and so spent them much time; When They were in the heat and passion of the Debate, they oftentimes were entangled in their questions; so that when He reported to the House the work of the day, he did frequently report two or three Votes directly contrary to each other, which, in the heat of their debate, they had unawares run into. And after near Twenty days spent in that manner, they found themselves very little advanced towards a Conclusion, and that they must Review all that they had done; and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>the King being resolv'd to begin his journey for <HI>Scotland,</HI> They were forced to discontinue their belov'd Bill, and let it rest; S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur Haslerig</HI> declaring in the House, <Q>“”That he would never hereafter put an Enemy into the Chair:</Q> nor had they ever after the courage to resume the consideration of the Bill, till after the War was entred into.</P>
<P>THE time being come▪ within two or three days (according to his former Declaration) for the King's Journey into <HI>Scotland,</HI> the House of Commons thought it time to lay aside their Disputes upon the Church, which every day grew more involv'd, and to intend the per∣fecting <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the Act of Pacification, and the Order for Disbanding; both which were thought necessary to be dispatch'd, before his Majesty should begin his Progress; and might have been long since done. On a sud∣dain,
<PB N="217" REF="2390"/>
the House of Commons grew into a perplex'd Debate, concerning the King's Journey into <HI>Scotland</HI> (which had been long before known, and solemnly promised by his Majesty to the Commissioners of <HI>Scot∣land;</HI> where preparation was made for his reception, and the Parlia∣ment summon'd there accordingly) and express'd many dark and doubt∣ful apprehensions of his Safety; not without some glances, <Q>“”that if his Majesty were once with his Army, he might possibly enter upon new Counsels,</Q> before he consented to Disband it; and in the end concluded, <Q>“”to desire the Lords to join with them, in a Request to <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="line"/> the King, to defer his journey into <HI>Scotland,</HI> till the Act of Pacifica∣tion was pass'd, the Armies disbanded, and till such other Acts were prepared,</Q> as should be thought necessary for the good of the King∣dom; without mentioning any time, against which those things should be ready: which, though it was an unreasonable request, yet, most men having no mind the King should go into <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was con∣sented to by Both Houses; and thereupon, an Address was made to his Majesty to that purpose: who return'd his Answer, <Q>“”that He was sor∣ry, the Houses having had so long notice of his intentions for that Journey (which could not but appear very reasonable to them) had <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> neglected to prepare all such things, as were necessary to be dispatch'd by him before he went; That, though his presence in <HI>Scotland</HI> was depended upon, by such a day, and the Disappointment might beget some Prejudice to him, yet, he was content to satisfy Their desires so far, as to defer his Journey for Fourteen days; within which time they might make all things ready that were of importance, and be∣yond which time it would not be possible for him to make any stay.</Q></P>
<P>THIS time being gotten, They proceeded but slowly in the Directions for Disbanding (though the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was gone down to the Army) <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> or in the Act of the Pacification; but continued their men∣tion <Q>“”of Fears and Jealousies of the Peace of the Kingdom; of an In∣vasion from Forreign parts; and an Insurrection of the Papists in <HI>Eng∣land:</HI> against all which, they said, there was not yet Sufficient Pro∣vision,</Q> by the Laws and Constitution of the Kingdom. And there∣fore one day, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur Haslerig</HI> (who, as was said before, was used<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur Haslerig</HI> pre∣fers a Bill for Settling the Militia</NOTE> by that Party, like the Dove out of the Ark, to try what Footing there was) preferr'd a Bill <Q>“”for the Settling the Militia of the Kingdom, both by Sea and Land,</Q> in Such persons as They should nominate; with all those Powers and Jurisdictions, which have been Since granted <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> or S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> by Land, or to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> by Sea. There were in the Bill no Names, but Blanks to receive them, when the matter should be pass'd; though men were assured, that the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> was their Confident by Land, and the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> by Sea: and yet the inclination to the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> would have begot some disturbance, if the matter had come then to be press'd.</P>
<P>WHEN the Title of this Bill was read, it gave so general an Offence<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sollicitor <HI>Saint-John</HI> seconds it.</NOTE> to the House, that it seem'd inclined to throw it out, without suffering it to be read▪ not without some Reproach to the person that brought <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> it in, "as a matter of Sedition; till M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Saint-John,</HI> the King's Solli∣citor, rose up, and spoke to it, and (having, intruth, Himself drawn the Bill) said, <Q>“”He thought That Passion and Dislike very unseasona∣ble, Before the Bill was read; That it was the highest Priviledge of

As for the Matter, which by the Title that Bill seem'd to comprehend, He was of opinion, that somewhat was necessary to be done in it; for He was sure, that such Power, as might be necessary for the Security of the Kingdom, over the Militia, was not yet by Law vested in any person; or in the Crown it self: That They had lately by their Votes Blasted and Condemn'd the Power of Lords Lieutenants, and their Deputies, which had been long exercised, and submitted to by the People▪ That, since <MILESTONE N="1$" UNIT="line"/> that was determin'd, it was necessary to substitute Such in their room, as might be able to Suppress any Insurrection, or Resist any Invasion: And therefore, that it was fit to hear the Bill read; and if any sitting expedient was proposed in it to that purpose, to embrace it; other∣wise, to think of a better. For the Nomination of Persons, it would not be seasonable to speak of it, till the Power and Jurisdiction were first settled and constituted; and then, if it seem'd too great for any Subject, it might be devolv'd upon the Crown; which Yet was not sufficiently possess'd of a Legal Power to the purposes asoresaid.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bill read <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> UPON this Discourse, by a person of the King's sworn Council, the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Bill was read; but with so universal a Dislike, that it was never call'd upon the Second time, but slept, till long after the matter of it was di∣gested in Ordinances.</P>
<P>THE peremptory day again drawing very near, for the King's jour∣ney into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and very little done towards the Publick, since the time they had prevail'd with his Majesty to suspend it, On a <HI>Saturday,</HI> in the Afternoon (the Progress being to begin on <HI>Monday)</HI> They again fell into violent Passion against the King's going into <HI>Scotland:</HI> the which they thought of so great importance to be hinder'd, that they re∣solv'd (and prevail'd with the Lords to do the like) to Sit the next <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> day, being <HI>Sunday;</HI> which had scarce ever before been known, since the first institution of Parliaments; and which they thought fit to excuse by a short Declaration, that the People might not be thereby encou∣raged to Prophane the Sabbath.</P>
<P>WHEN they found the King constant to his former Resolution, and that all They could alledge could prevail no farther with him, than, whereas he intended to go on <HI>Monday</HI> after dinner, to stay till <HI>Tues∣day</HI> morning, They very earnestly proposed, <Q>“”that He would leave a Commission with some Persons, to Pass such Acts as should be pre∣pared and pass both Houses in his absence▪ and to make a <HI>Custos Regni,</HI> <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> to supply the place of Government till his return:</Q> with many other Extravagances, which Themselves understood not. But when they found that no such Commission could be Legally granted, to Consent to any Acts that were not consented to by Both Houses at the date of the Commission; and that both the Person and the Power of a <HI>Custos Regni,</HI> would be duly weigh'd, and would take up much consideration, if the King were willing to satisfy them; They were contented with a Commission to the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> of Lievtenant-General on that side<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Act of Pa∣cification be∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> King begins <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to∣wards Scot∣land.</NOTE> <HI>Trent:</HI> which his Majesty having granted; and confirm'd the Act of Pa∣cification between the two Kingdoms (which in great hast was trans∣acted <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in both Houses, as if it had been only matter of Form) he took his journey from <HI>London</HI> towards <HI>Scotland</HI> toward the middle of <HI>August,</HI> leaving both Houses sitting at <HI>Westminster.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="2410"/>
THE unexpected Passion and Importunity to hinder his Majesty's journey into <HI>Scotland,</HI> was not well understood; and the less, for that the Governing Party was divided upon it: Some of them, with trouble equal to what they had at any time express'd, insisting upon his not going; Others alledging, <Q>“”that his Majesty was so far engaged in it, that he could not in honour recede from it:</Q> Whilst the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commis∣sioners, who were often appeal▪d and referr'd to in the Debate, an∣swer'd so mysteriously, as argued rather a conveniency, and expectation of the Journey it self, than any necessity in point of time. Neither <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> was the ground of his Majesty's so positive and unalterable resolution of going thither, sufficiently clear to Standers by; who thought he might have transacted the business of that Kingdom (where he could not rea∣sonably expect any great reverence to his Person) better at a distance; and that his Presence might be more necessary in This.</P>
<P>BUT, as his Majesty's impatiency to see both Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es disbanded, and this Kingdom freed from the Invasion (both which he heartily de∣sired and his desire to refresh himself, from the vexation which the Two Houses, or One of them, or Some in one of them, daily gave him; hurried him to that Expedition, without well weighing and preparing <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> how to comport himself through it: So no doubt, that opposition and instance against it (besides the continued desire they had to remove the King from any fix'd resolution) was design'd partly, to procure an excuse for the hasty passing the Bill of Pacification; which they had pur∣posely retarded (foreseeing there were many particulars in it, that if weigh'd, would never have been consented to) till they might be so straitned in time, that whosoever objected against what was offer▪d, might seem to hinder the Disbanding, and to necessitate the King's longer stay: but principally they hoped, that his Majesty, rather than defer his Journey on which he was resolv'd, would consent to any unreasona∣ble <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> qualifying Such persons whom They should name, with Power in his absence: and moreover probably there was some real Jealousy of the <HI>Scots</HI> at that time, and between the <HI>Scotish</HI> Commissioners them∣selves (as was conceiv'd by some) by reason of great addresses made to the King by the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> the principal and governing person of that Nation, and some insinuation of favour from his Majesty to him; so that they did in earnest desire to put off that Journey, for fear of di∣sturbance There.</P>
<P>THE truth is, the King was well satisfied with the Promises made to him by that Earl; who desired to live in this Court, and was to have <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> been shortly made Gentleman of the Bed chamber, and was in hope to marry a great and wealthy Lady: And it is certain, the King ex∣pected, by His help and interest, to have found such a Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as would have been more tender of His honour than they after express'd themselves; and did allways impute the failing thereof to the absence of that Earl, who being sick at the King's going from <HI>London,</HI> within six weeks after died. But Others believ'd, He had been so far guilty of what had been done amiss, that he would neither have been able, nor willing, to preserve the foundation of that Power, which might hardly have forgotten by what means it had been oppress'd.</P>

<PB N="220" REF="2420"/>
not that use for which it was raised (which was, to have visited <HI>Scot∣land▪</HI> and finding often mention, enviously and maliciously, made of that Army, in the House of Commons; and having from thence (by the advice of the Committee for <HI>Ireland)</HI> receiv▪d some Addresses for that pur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se; resolv▪d to Disband them: and to that end, signified his Plea∣sure to the Lords Justices of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> his L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nant▪General of that Army; directing withall (according to the last ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice he had receiv▪d from the Earl of <HI>Strafford)</HI> <Q>“”that any Of∣ficers of the Army, should have free leave to transport what men they could get of that Army, for the service of any Prince in amity with <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> this Crown:</Q> and shortly after, upon the earnest desire of <HI>Don Alon∣so de Cardenas,</HI> Embassador from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> his Majesty con∣sented, that four thousand Soldiers of that Army should be transported for the service of that King into <HI>Flanders;</HI> at the same time permit∣ting as many as desired the same, to be transported for the service of the <HI>French</HI> King. This was no sooner known, but the House of Commons interposed, with their accustom▪d confidence and distemper, <Q>“”to be∣seech his Majesty to revoke that Licence;</Q> and, by impertinent and slight reasons, boldly urged and insisted on, as they did in every thing else, prevail▪d with the King, <Q>“”to inhibit the transporting any of those <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Soldiers out of that Kingdom, for the service of any Prince what∣soever.</Q></P>
<P>MANY were of opinion that this activity in a business of which They had not the least connusance, proceeded from the instigation of the Embassador of the <HI>French</HI> King; who was very conversant with the principal persons of that Faction, and no doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omented those humors out of which the Publick Calamities were bred; and some said bold∣ly, and one or two have since affirm'd it, as upon their knowledge, <Q>“”that M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> receiv▪d five thousand pound from that <HI>French</HI> Minister, to hinder that Supply to <HI>Spain.</HI></Q> Others believ▪d, that it proceeded <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> only from that proud and petulant spirit which possess'd them, to lessen the reputation of the King▪ and to let the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and all other Princes see the Power They had, to oppose and cross His resolutions in the most pure acts of Soveraignty. But I believe, though there might be a mixture of Both the other reasons, the principal motive that induced them to that Interposition, was the advice and desire of the Committee from the Parliament of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whose counsel was entire∣ly follow'd in Whatsoever concern▪d that Kingdom; and who no doubt might have some Prospect of the Rebellion that shortly after broke out, which could hardly have taken effect, it that Body of men had <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> been removed out of the Kingdom, according to the King's direction.

<P>ASSOON as the King begun his Journey for <HI>Scotland,</HI> all Orders, and what else was necessary, were dispatch'd for the Disbanding; and a Resolution taken, <Q>“”to send a Committee of Lords and Commons to attend his Majesty (that is, to be a Spy upon him) in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to be present when the Act of Pacification should be transacted in that Parliament, and to preserve the good Intercourse and Correspon∣dence which was begun between the two Nations:</Q> but intruth, to lay the Scene how the next Year should be spent; and to bespeak new <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Laws for This Kingdom, by the Copies of what should be consented to for That</P>

<P>BUT of late, it cannot be denied, that, by the great Power of some Bishops at Court, it had much overflow'd the Banks which should have contain'd it; not only in meddling with things that intruth were not properly within Their connusance; but extending their Sentences and Judgements in matters tryable before them, beyond that degree that was Justifiable; and grew to have so great a Contempt of the Common Law, and the Professors of it (which was a Fatal Unskilfulness in the Bishops, who could never have Suffer'd whilst the Common Law had been Preserv'd) that Prohibitions from the Supream Courts of Law, <MILESTONE N="5$" UNIT="line"/> which have, and r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust have, the Superintendency over all Inferior Courts, were not only Neglected, but the Judges Reprehended for granting them (which without Perjury They could not deny) and the Lawyers Discountenanced for moving for them (which They were
<PB N="222" REF="2440"/>
obliged in Duty to do) So that thereby, the Clergy made allmost a Whole Profession, if not their Enemies, yet very Undevoted to them.</P>
<P>THEN, it was grown from an Ecclesiastical Court, for the reforma∣tion of Manners, to a Court of Revenue; and imposed great Fines upon those who were culpable before them; sometimes above the degree of the Offence, had the jurisdiction of Fining been unquestionable: which it was not. Which course of Fining was much more frequent, and the Fines heavier, after the King had granted all that Revenue (whatso∣ever it should prove to be) to be employ'd for the Reparation of S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Paul</HI>▪s Church; which, though it were a glorious work, and worthy <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Piety of Those who advanced it, and the Greatness of His mind who principally intended it, made the Grievance the heavier.</P>
<P>BY these means (besides the Conflux and Influence of That part of the Clergy then in Town, which had formerly been Obnoxious, and Suppress▪d by the Bishops: Which I do not mention as any piece of Their Exorbitancy; for I do not know that ever any Innocent Clergy-man Suffer▪d by any Ecclesiastical Censure; though, it may be▪ the Guilty were More Severely proceeded against, and with Less Politick circumstances▪ than the nature of that time required) that Court had very few Friends; and having many Enemies, the Proposition for Abo∣lishing <MILESTONE N="2$" UNIT="line"/> it was easily hearkn'd to; of which the Violent Party readily taking notice, they who prepared the Bill inserted Clauses, that not only took away the High Commission Court, which was intended, but, upon the matter, the whole Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction; and, under pre∣tence of Reforming the great Abuses by the Oath <HI>ex Officio,</HI> and Ex∣commun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cation, Destroy'd and Cancell▪d all Coercive Power whatsoever in those Courts, which was never intended: Yet, in that hurry, it made a progress through Both Houses, and attended the Royal assent. But, when his Majesty understood the Extent thereof▪ and how far the Body of the Bill exceeded the Title; and that, instead of Reformation, <MILESTONE N="3$" UNIT="line"/> it was opening a door to the most Scandalous Offences, and leaving Adultery and Incest as Unpunishable, as any other acts of good Fellow∣ship; He made a pause in the Consenting to it, till Both Houses might review whether the Remedy were proportionable to the Disease.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY the Fire was kindled against the Bishops, as the Only Obstacles to any Reformation; with some Passionate insinuations, <Q>“”that, since They opposed a due Regulation of their Power, there would be no way but to cut them off Root and Branch.</Q> And thereupon, some Bishops themselves were again made instruments; and Others who pretended to take care of the Church, persuaded the King, <Q>“”for <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the Bishops sake,</Q> to confirm that Bill: whilst the Designers were much pleased to find that Logick prevail; little doubting, but when they had taken away their Jurisdiction in the Church, by that Bill, and their Dignity in the State, by moving them out of the House of Peers, They should find it no hard matter to abolish Their Names, and Titles out of the Kingdom; and to enjoy the goodly Lands and Revenues, which could Only make the Reformation perfect and compleat. And in this manner that Law was enacted.</P>

from Riots, Perjury, and the most notorious Misdemeanours, to an Asserting all Proclamations, and Orders of State; to the Vindi∣cating Illegal Commissions, and Grants of Monopolies (all which were the chief Ground-works of their late Proceedings) no man could hope to be longer free from the Inquisition of that Court, than he resolv'd to submit to those, and the like extraordinary courses.

<P>IT could not meet with any Opposition in the House of Peers. All who had been Judges There, having their several Judgements hanging like Meteors over their Heads; and the Rest, being either Grieved, or Frighted, by it: and so, being brought to his Majesty, receiv'd his Royal assent.</P>

<P>DuRING the time of the King's abode at <HI>York,</HI> which was not many days, the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> Lord General, made a suit to him for the making a Baron; which, at that time, might have been worth to him ten thousand pounds, Whether the King apprehended the making an unfit man, who might disserve him in the House of Peers; or whether <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> he resolv'd to contain himself from enlarging that number, except upon an extraordinary relation to his Own Service; I know not: but he thought not fit, at that time, to gratify the Earl: by which He took himself to be highly Disobliged (as the Courtiers of that time look'd upon whatsoever was Denied to them, as Taken from them) and having receiv'd some Information, from S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jacob Ashley</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Coniers,</HI> of some Idle Passages in the late tampering with the Army to Petition, which had not been before heard of; assoon as the King was gone to∣wards <HI>Scotland</HI> (though his Majesty hath since told me, <Q>“”that he thought

And, as upon those, and the like light occasions, They grew to a licence of Language, without the least respect of Persons, of how Venerable estimation soever; so they departed from all Orders of Regularity in Debate; or Rules and Measures in Judging; the chief Ru∣lers amongst them, first designing what They thought Fit to be done, and the Rest concluding any thing Lawful, that They thought, in order to the doing and compassing the same: in which neither Laws nor Customs could be admitted to signify any thing against Their sense. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>I REMEMBER, about that time, in the providing Money for the Disbanding the Armies, upon which they were marvellously sollicitous, from the time that the King went towards the North, there arose a Question, <Q>“”Whether <HI>Wilmot, Ashburnham,</HI> and <HI>Pollard,</HI> should receive their Pay due to them upon their several Commands, lying under the Charge of the Plot,</Q> for bringing up, and Corrupting the Army; very many Passionately alledging, <Q>“”that Such men ought not to receive their Pay,</Q> who had Forfeited their Trust: Yet there wanted not many who alledg'd, <Q>“”that They had the Security of an Act of Parliament for their Payment, and that in Justice it could not be detain'd from them; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that, though they lay under the Displeasure of the House, they were so far from a Judgment yet, that there was not so much as a Charge against them, but that they were at liberty under Bail; and therefore, they could not be said to have Forfeited any thing that was their own.</Q> In this debate the House seem'd equally divided, till One, who well knew what he said, told them <Q>“”That there could not be any Reasonable Pretence for Detaining their due, as well for the Reasons that had been given, as, that they were absolutely Pardon'd by the late Act of Oblivion,</Q> and Pacification, between the two Kingdoms: the which was no sooner said, than many of Those who were before in∣clined <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to the Gentlemen, changed their opinions, and, without so much as calling to have the Statute read, declared, <Q>“”That They could have no Benefit by that Act of Parliament, because then, the Same might
<PB N="231" REF="2510"/>
be as well applied to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></Q> And so, without further weighing the Law, or the Reason, it was thought sufficient, not only to exclude them from that Benefit, but to bar them from their Money; lest They might be thought to be admitted to it for That rea∣son, which might prove an advantage to Another, to Whom They had no inclination to be Just. And no question, They had been overseen in the Penning that Statute; the Words, in their true and genuine signi∣fication and extent, comprehending as well the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI> as Those, who at that time had no contempt of the Security they <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> reap'd thereby.</P>
<P>SOON after the King went into <HI>Scotland,</HI> there being some motion "to Adjourn the Houses till after <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> which seem'd to be ge∣nerally inclined to, very many of both Houses, being willing to refresh themselves, after so long absence from their homes (the Summer being far spent, and the Plague increasing; of which some Members had died; and others were in danger, having been in infected houses) and conceiv∣ing, that there was no more to be done till the return of the King, saving only the procuring Money to finish the Disbanding; went into the Country: and others who staid in the Town, were less sollicitous <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to attend the Publick Service; but betook themselves to those exercises and refreshments which were pleasanter to them: insomuch, as within twenty days after the King's remove, there were not above Twenty Lords, nor much above a Hundred Commoners, in Both Houses. But This was the advantage look'd for; Those Persons continuing (especial∣ly in the House of Commons) to Whose care and managery the Whole Reformation was committed, They Now entred upon the consultation of the highest matters, both in Church and State; and made attempts and entries upon those Regalities and Foundations, which have been Since more evident, in wider and more notorious Breaches.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> FROM the liberty and success of advising what was Fit to be done out of the Kingdom, with reference to the Levies for <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> They assumed the same freedom, of consulting and determining what was Not fit, within the walls of the Church; and finding their numbers to be so thin, that they might, by art or accident, prevail with the ma∣jor part to be of Their mind; and to gratify the more Violent Party of the Reformers (who, with great impatience, suffer'd themselves to be contain'd within any bounds or limits, by Those who knew better how to conduct their business) They entred upon debate of the Book of Common-Prayer (which sure, at that time, was much reverenced <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> throughout the Kingdom) and proposed, <Q>“”in regard (they said) many things in it gave offence, at least umbrage to tender Consciences, That there might be liberty to Disuse it.</Q> which Proposition was so un∣gracious, that, though it was made in a thin House; and press'd by Those who were of the greatest Power and Authority; It was so far from being consented to, that, by the major part (the House consisting then of about Sixscore) it was Voted, "That it should be duly observ'd.</P>

But the major part of the Lords being much scan∣dalized, that the House of Commons should not only unseasonably, and irregularly, interpose in a matter wherein they had not the least juris∣diction; but should presume to disturb the Peace of the Church, and in∣terrupt the Settled and Legal Government thereof, by such Schisma∣tical presumption; not only refused to join with them, but instead there∣of, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> directed an Order, formerly made by the House of Peers (on the Sixteenth of <HI>Jannuary</HI> before) to be Printed, to this effect, <Q>“”That the Divine Service should be perform'd, as it is appointed by the Acts of Parliament of this Realm; and that all Such as shall Disturb that Wholesom Order▪</Q> shall be Severely Punish'd according to Law; and acquainted the Commons therewith: Who, nothing satisfied, pursued their former Order; and <Q>“”commanding all the Commons of <HI>England</HI> to Submit to Their direction, declared, That the Order of the Lords was made by the Consent but of Eleven Lords, and that Nine other Lords did Dissent from it; and therefore, that No Obedience should <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> be given thereunto.</Q> Whereas, the Order had been made in Full Par∣liament, seven months before; and was Seasonably order'd to be Pub∣lish'd, by the Major Part present, upon that Important occasion. And Such an Arraigning the House of Peers, for Publishing an Order in main∣tainance of the Laws establish'd; by Those who had no Authority to declare what the Law was; nor a Jurisdiction over Those who should infringe the Law; was so transcendent a Presumption, and Breach of Pri∣viledge, that there was great expectation what the Lords would do in their own Vindication.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> THERE was one Clause in the Act of Pacification, <Q>“”that there should <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> be a Publick and Solemn Day of Thanksgiving for the Peace be∣tween the two Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> But no day being appointed for that act of Indevotion, the Lords and Commons assumed the Power to themselves of directing it; and to that purpose, made an Ordinance (as they call'd it) <Q>“”that it should be observ'd on the Seventh of <HI>September</HI> following, throughout the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> and Dominion of <HI>Wales.</HI></Q> Which was done accordingly; the Factious Mi∣nisters in all Pulpits, taking occasions then to magnify the Parliament, and the <HI>Scots;</HI> and to infuse as much Malignity into the People, against Those who were not of that Faction, as their Wit and Malice could sug∣gest. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> The House of Commons celebrating that day in the Chappel at <HI>Lincoln</HI>▪s-Inn; because the Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> as Dean of <HI>Westminster,</HI> had form'd a Prayer for that occasion, and enjoin'd it to be read on that day, in those Churches where He had Jurisdiction; which They liked not: both as it was a Form; and form'd by Him; and so avoided coming there.</P>

And that They might be the better prepared to keep up the Prejudice to the King, and the Keenness against the Court, till the coming together of both Houses; when, they had reason to believe, the observation of Their crooked and indirect Courses, and their visible, unwarrantable Breaches, upon the Church, and the Religion establish'd <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> by Law, would render men less devoted to them; his Lordship fur∣nish'd them with many Informations of what had pass'd in the late Ar∣my, which might be wrested to the King's disadvantage: told them whatsoever the King himself had said to him, when He look'd upon him as a Person True to him, and when, it is very probable, He was not much delighted with the Proceedings at <HI>Westminster;</HI> and of all the par∣ticulars, which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jacob Ashley</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Coniers</HI> had inform'd him, when they took him to be of entire Trust with his Majesty, and whole∣ly under that consideration (whereupon, They were afterwards exa∣min▪d, and compell▪d to testify That in Publick, which they had before <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> imparted to Him in the greatest Secrecy) and added to all this, what∣ever information he had receiv'd by the Lady <HI>Carlisle,</HI> of Words or Actions, spoken or done by the Queen, which might increase Their Jea∣lousy or Malice to her Majesty.

<P>THE short Recess of the Parliament, though it was not much above the space of a Month, was yet a great Refreshment, to Those who had <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Sate near a full Year, Mornings and Afternoons, with little or no inter∣mission; and in that warm region, where Thunder and Lightning was made. Some very Unwarrantable Proceedings, by the Committee that
<PB N="235" REF="2550"/>
Sate during the Recess; or M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym,</HI> who sate in the Chair of that Com∣mittee, and issued out those Orders concerning the Church; gave so much Offence, and Scandal, that the Members were like to meet toge∣ther with more Courage, and less inclinations to Novelties, than they had parted with. But there were several Accidents fell out, some from very little, and some from very great Causes, which had that Influ∣ence upon the Nature and Spirit of men, and upon the Actions of that time, that, for the better understanding some particular Passages, which will appear pertinent, it will be even necessary, briefly, and it shall be <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> but very briefly, to mention some of those Particulars.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A small Com∣mittee of Both Houses at∣tended the King in <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></NOTE> WHEN the King went into <HI>Scotland;</HI> for the better preserving the Correspondence between the two Kingdoms, as was pretended; and to see all things perform▪d, which were to be done in the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Act of Pacification; a small Committee (as hath been before said) was appointed by the two Houses, consisting of one Lord, and two Commons, to Attend (as the Phrase was) upon his Majesty: but, intruth, to be Spies upon him; and to give the same assistance to the Parliament There, upon any emergent occasion, as the <HI>Scotish</HI> Com∣missioners had done Here.</P>

<P>THE Latter hath been mention'd before, as a man of great Under∣standing, and Parts; and of great Sagacity in discerning mens natures and manners; and he must, upon all occasions, still be mention'd, as a per∣son of great Dexterity and Abilities, and Equal to any trust or employ∣ment, good or bad, which he was inclined to undertake.</P>
<P>THE Other, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Stapleton,</HI> was a proper man of a fair extra∣ction; but, being a Branch of a Younger Family, inherited but a mode∣rate <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Estate, about five hundred pounds a year, in <HI>Torkshire;</HI> and, accord∣ing to the custom of that Country, had spent much time in those de∣lights which Horses and Dogs administer. Being return'd to serve in Parliament, He concurr'd with his Neighbours, <HI>Hotham,</HI> and <HI>Cholmond∣ley;</HI> being much younger than they, and govern'd by them in the Pro∣secution of the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> and so was easily receiv'd into the Company and Familiarity of that whole Party, which took that work to heart; and in a short time, appear▪d a man of Vigour in body and mind; and to be rather Without good Breeding, than not Capable of it; and so He quickly outgrew his Friends and Country-men, in the Con∣fidence <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of those who govern'd: They looking upon him, as worth the getting entirely to them; and not averse from being gotten; and so join'd him with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden</HI> in this their first employment (and the First, that ever a Parliament had of that kind) to be initiated

under so great a Master; whose Instruction He was very capable of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> THERE had been, even from the time the <HI>Scotish</HI> Army came into <HI>England,</HI> many Factions, and Jealousies, amongst the Principal Persons of that Nation; but none so much taken notice of, as that between the two Earls, of <HI>Montross,</HI> and <HI>Argyle.</HI> The Former took himself to have Deserv▪d as much as any man, in contributing more, and appear∣ing sooner, in Their first approach towards Rebellion; as indeed he was a man of the best Quality, who did so soon discover himself: and it may be he did it the sooner, in Opposition to <HI>Argyle;</HI> who, being then of the King's Council, he doubted not, would be of his Majesty's Party. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> The People look▪d upon them Both, as Young men of unlimited Am∣bition; and used to say, <Q>“”That they were like <HI>Caesa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Pompey,</HI> the One would endure no Superior,</Q> and the Other would have no Equal. True it is, that from the time that <HI>Argyle</HI> declared himself against the King (which was immediately after the First Pacification) <HI>Montross</HI> appear▪d with less vigour for the Covenant; and had, by underhand and secret insinuations, made proffer of his Service to the King. But now, after his Majesty's arrival in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the introduction of M <HI>Wil∣liam Murray</HI> of the Bed-chamber, He came privately to the King; and inform▪d him of many Particulars, from the beginning of the Rebellion; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and <Q>“”that the Marquis of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> was no less Faulty, and False to∣wards his Majesty, than <HI>Argyle;</HI> and offer▪d "to make Proof of all in the Parliament;</Q> but rather desired, "to have them Both made away; which He frankly undrtook to do: but the King, abhorring that ex∣pedient, though for his own Security, advised, <Q>“”that the Proofs might be prepared for the Parliament.</Q> When suddainly, on a <HI>Sunday</HI> morn∣ing, the City of <HI>Edenborough</HI> was in Arms; and <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Argyle,</HI> both gone out of the Town to their own Houses; where they stood upon their guards; declaring publickly, <Q>“”That they had withdrawn themselves, because they knew that there was a design to Assassinate <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> them; and chose rather to absent themselves, than by standing upon their Defence in <HI>Edenborough</HI> (which they could well have done) to hazard the Publick Peace,</Q> and Security of the Parliament; which thunder▪d on their behalf.</P>
<P>THE Committee at <HI>Edenborough</HI> dispatch▪d away an Express to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> with a dark and perplex'd account, in the morning that the two Lords had left the City; with many doubtful expressions, <Q>“”what the end of it would be:</Q> not without some dark insinuations, as if the De∣sign might look farther than <HI>Scotland.</HI> And these Letters were brought to <HI>London,</HI> the day before the Houses were to come together, after the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Recess; all That Party taking pains to Perswade Others, <Q>“”that it could not but be a Design, to Assassinate More men than those Lords at <HI>Edenborough.</HI></Q></P>

Their design upon <HI>Dublin</HI> was miraculously discover'd, the night before it was to be executed; and so the Surprizal of that Castle pre∣vented; and the principal Conspirators, who had the charge of it, appre∣hended. In the other parts of the Kingdom, They observ'd the time <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> appointed, not hearing of the Misfortunes of their Friends at <HI>Dublin.</HI> A general Insurrection of the <HI>Irish</HI> spread it self over the whole Coun∣try; in such an Inhumane and Barbarous manner, that there were Forty or Fifty Thousand of the <HI>English</HI> Protestants murther'd, before they suspected themselves in any danger; or could provide for their De∣fence, by drawing together into Towns, or strong Houses.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Dublin,</HI> the Lords Justices, and Council, dispatch'd their Let∣ters by an Express (the same man who had made the Discovery, one <HI>Oconelly,</HI> who had sormerly been a Servant to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Clotworthy)</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Leicester,</HI> then Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland.</HI> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> From the Parts of the North, and <HI>Ulster,</HI> an Express was sent to the King himself, at <HI>Edenborough;</HI> and the King's Letters from thence, to the two Houses, arrived within less than two days, after the Messenger from <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>IT was upon a <HI>Sunday</HI> night, that the Letters from <HI>Dublin</HI> came to the Earl of <HI>Leicester;</HI> who immediately caused the Council to be sum∣mon▪d, and as soon as it was met, inform'd them of the condition of <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> that is, so much as those Letters contain'd: which were written, when little more was known than the Discovery at <HI>Dublin;</HI> and what the Conspirators had confess'd upon their examinations. The House of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Peers had then adjourned it self to the <HI>Wednesday</HI> following; but the House of Commons were to meet on the next day, <HI>Monday</HI> morning; and the Council resolv'd, <Q>“”that they would in a Body go to the House of Commons,</Q> assoon as it Sate, and inform them of it; which they did; notice being first given to the House, <Q>“”that the Lords of the Coun∣cil had some matters of Importance to impart to them, and were above in the Painted Chamber ready to come to them:</Q> whereupon, Chairs were set in the House for them to repose themselves, and the Ser∣jeant sent to conduct them.

Letters, to impart them to that House;</Q> and so referr'd the business to the Lord Lieutenant; who, without any inlargement, only read the Letters he had receiv d, and so the Lords departed from the House.</P>
<P>THERE was a deep Silence in the House, and a kind of Consterna∣tion; most mens heads having been Intoxicated from their First meeting in Parliament, with imaginations of Plots, and Treasonable Designs, through the Three Kingdoms. The affair it self seem'd to be out of their cognisance; and the communication of it, serv▪d only to prepare their thoughts, what to do when more should be known; and when they should hear what the King thought fit to be done. And when the King's <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Letters arrived, they were glad the news had come to him, when he had so good Council about him to advise him what to do.</P>
<P>THE King was not then inform▪d of what had been discover'd at <HI>Dublin;</HI> but the Letters out of <HI>Ulster</HI> (which he sent to the Parlia∣ment) gave him notice <Q>“”of a general Insurrection in the North; and of the Inhumane Murthers committed there, upon a multitude of the Protestants; and that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Phelim O Neil</HI> appear'd as their General, and Commander in chief.</Q></P>

<P>THIS fell out to their wish; and thereupon, they made a Committee of Both Houses, <Q>“”for the consideration of the affairs of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> providing for the supply of Men, Arms, and Money, for the Suppres∣sing that Rebellion;</Q> the Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland</HI> being one of the Committee; which sate every morning in the Painted Chamber; and the Lord Lieutenant first communicated all the Letters he receiv'd, to Them to be consulted on, and to be thence reported to the two Houses; which were hereby possess'd of a large Power, and Dependence; all men applying themselves to Them, that is to the chief Leaders, for their Preferments in that War: the Mischief whereof, though in the be∣ginning little taken notice of, was afterwards felt by the King very sensibly. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THESE concurrent Circumstances, much alter'd and suppress'd that good humour and spirit the Houses were well disposed to meet in; and the Angry men, who were disappointed of the Preferments they ex∣pected, and had promised themselves, took all occasions, by their Emis∣saries, to insinuate into the minds of the People, <Q>“”that this Rebellion in <HI>Ireland,</HI> was contrived and fomented by the King; or at least by the Queen, for the advancement of Popery; and that the Rebels pub∣lish▪d and declared, That they had the King▪s Authority for all they did:</Q> which Calumny, though without the least Shadow or Colour of Truth, made more Impression upon the minds of Sober and Moderate <MILESTONE N="5$" UNIT="line"/> men (who, till that time, had much disliked the Passionate Proceedings of the Parliament) than could be Then imagin▪d; or can Yet be believ'd.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons offended at it.</NOTE> ASSOON as the House of Commons heard of this designation of his Majesty's (having then newly the Second time sent up to the House of Peers, their Bill to remove Bishops from thence) They were much
<PB N="240" REF="2600"/>
troubled, that at a time when They resolv'd to take away the Old, the King should presume to make New Bishops; and to create so many Voices to assist the other; and therefore, They urged very earnestly, <Q>“”That the Lords might be moved to join with them, in sending to the King, to make no new Bishops, till the Controversy should be ended about the Government of the Church:</Q> which appear'd so Unreasona∣ble, that the Wisest of Them who wish'd it, apprehended no Possibi∣lity that the Lords would join with them; or if They did, that the King would be prevail'd with. However, being glad to find their Compa∣nions had so much mettal, after a long Debate, the major part carried it, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”That a Committee should be appointed, to draw up Reasons to give the Lords,</Q> to concur with Them in that desire to the King: but, after that, moved that Stone no further.</P>
<P>IN all Debates of this nature, where the Law, Reason, and Common Sense, were directly Opposite to what they proposed, They suffer'd Those who differ'd from them in opinion, and purposes, to say what they thought fit in opposition; and then, without vouchsafing to endea∣vour their satisfaction, call'd importunately for the Question; well knowing, that They had a Plurality of Voices to concur with them, in whatsoever they desired. I remember, in this last business, when it <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> was voted that a Committee should be named to draw up Reasons, many of Those who had during the Debate positively argued Against the thing, were call'd upon to be of that Committee; and amongst them, the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde:</HI> who stood up, and <Q>“”desired to be Ex∣cused from that Service, where they could be of no Use; having given so many reasons against it, that they could not apprehend any could be given for it; therefore thought, the work would be better done, if Those who had satisfied Themselves with the Reasonableness of what they wish▪d, would undertake the converting and disposing of Other men.</Q> There was a Gentleman who sate by (M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bond</HI> of <HI>Dorchester;</HI> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> very Severe, and Resolv▪d, against the Church and the Court) who, with much Passion, and Trouble of mind, said to them, <Q>“”For God's sake be of the Committee,</Q> You know none of Our side can give Reasons; which made Those that over-heard him Smile: though he spoke it sud∣dainly; and upon observation that the Leaders were not then in the House. Otherwise, it cannot be denied, Those who conducted them, and were the Contrivers of the Mischief, were men of great Parts; and un∣speakable Industry; and their Silence in some Debates, proceeded part∣ly from Pride, that it might appear, Their Reputation and Interest, had an Influence upon the Sense of the House, against any Rhetorick or <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Logick; but principally, from the Policy they were obliged to use: for, though they could have given a pregnant reason for the most extrava∣gant overture they ever made, and evinced it, that it was the proper way to Their end; yet, it not being time to discover their purposes (how apparent soever they were to discerning men) they were necessarily to give no reasons at all; or such as were not the true ones.</P>
<P>THIS Stratagem failing, of stopping the creation of the new Bishops; They endeavour, by all means, to hasten the House of Peers to di∣spatch the work before them, before they should be qualified (their Ele∣ctions, Confirmations, and Consecrations, and other Ceremonies, spend∣ing <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> much time) to increase the number of the Opposers; and, for the better doing thereof, with great confidence, They demand of the Lords, <Q>“”That no Recusant Lord, or any Bishop, might have a Vote in the
<PB N="241" REF="2610"/>
passing that Act: the last being Parties; and the other not supposed competent Judges on the behalf of the Kingdom.</Q> But, when they found that Logick could not prevail (the demand being indeed so Scan∣dalous, that the House of Peers, if they had not been fatally misled, must have resented it as a high Presumption, and insolent Breach of Pri∣viledge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with more Formality and Colour, though as Unreasonably, They press'd, <Q>“”That those Thirteen Bishops, whom They had before Impeach'd, for making the late Canons; and upon whom their Lord∣ships themselves had pass'd Severe Votes (such indeed as were fitter for <MILESTONE N="1$" UNIT="line"/> Accusers than Judges, Unparliamentary and Unprecedented) might be Sequestred from the House,</Q> till they should be brought to Judgement. And for this, They found Lawyers in their House, who, prostituting the Dignity and Learning of their Profession, to the cheap and vile af∣fectation of Popular Applause, were not ashamed, to aver Custom and Law for their Senseless Proposition. But the House of Peers was not Yet deluded enough, or terrified (though too many amongst them paid an implicit devotion to the House of Commons) to comply in this un∣reasonable demand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os∣t es at tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time between some great Lawyers and some Church-men produced great Mis∣chiefs.</NOTE> AND here I cannot but with grief and wonder remember, the Viru∣lency <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and Animosity express'd at that time, upon all occasions, by Many of good knowledge in the excellent and wise Profession of the Com∣mon Law, towards the Church, and Church-men; taking all opportu∣nities, uncharitably, to improve Mistakes, into Crimes; and, unrea∣sonably, to transfer and impute the Follies and Faults of Particular men, to the Malignity of their Order and Function; and so, whet and sharpen the edge of the Law, to wound the Church in its Jurisdiction; and at last to cut it up by the Roots, and demolish its Foundation. It can∣not be denied, that the Peevish spirits of some Clergy-men, have taken great pains to alienate that Profession from them; and Others, as un∣skilfully <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> (finding, that in former times, when the Religion of the State was a Vital part of its Policy, many Church-men were employ'd emi∣nently in the Civil Government of the Kingdom) imputed Their want∣ing those Ornaments their Predecessors wore, to the Power and Pre∣valency of the Lawyers; of Whom, some Principal men, in all times, They could not but observe to have been their avow'd Enemies: and so believ'd, the Straitning and Confining the Profession of the Common Law, must naturally Extend and Enlarge the Jurisdiction of the Church. Thence arose Their bold and unwarrantable Opposing and Protesting against Prohibitions, and other Proceedings at Law on the behalf of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Ecclesiastical Courts; and the procuring some Orders and Priviledges from the King, on the behalf of the Civil Law; even with an exclu∣sion of the other: as the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> prevail'd with the King to direct, <Q>“”that half the Masters of the Chancery should be all∣ways Civil Lawyers; and to declare, "that no Others, of what condi∣tion soever,</Q> should serve him as Masters of Request. All which was a great mistake: For, besides the stopping Prohibitions was an envious Breach upon the Justice of the Kingdom▪ which, at some time or other, will still be too hard for the strongest Opposers and Oppressors of it: I could never yet know, Why the Doctors of the Civil Law, were more <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of Kin to the Bishops, or the Church, than the Common Lawyers were. To say, that Their Places were in the Bishops disposal, as Chan∣cellors, Commissaries, and the like; and therefore, that their Persons were more like to be at Their disposal too; at least, to pay them greater
<PB N="242" REF="2620"/>
Reverence; concludes nothing: for the Clergy had opportunity enough, to oblige and create an equal dependence from the Profession of the Common Law; and I am perswaded, the Stewardships to B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shops, and of the Lands of the Church, which were to be managed by the Rules of the Common Law, were not much inferior in Profit to all the Chan∣cellorships in <HI>England.</HI> And then, if, where the Policy may consist with Justice, it is no ill measure in making Friendships, to look into, and compare, the Power of doing Hurt, or doing Good; it is apparent, that the Civil Law in this Kingdom, had not, in the least degree, the abi∣lity to Help, or to Hurt the Church, in any exigency; as the Common <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Law had: Whose Professors had allways, by their Interests, Experience, and Reputation, so great an Influence upon the Civil State, upon Court and Country▪ that they were notable Friends or Enemies. And the Dependence of the Church, as to their Inheritance, and Estates (except their minute Tythes) was entirely upon this Law; being only deter∣minable by those Rules, by which They have seldom receiv'd eminent Injustice. And truly, I have never yet spoken with one Clergy-man, who hath had the experience of both litigations, that hath not inge∣nuously confess'd, <Q>“”he had rather, in the respect of his trouble, charge, and satisfaction to his understanding, have Three Suits depending <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in <HI>Westminster</HI>-Hall, than One in the Arches, or any Ecclesiastical Court.</Q></P>
<P>THE Particulars above-mention'd, were, I confess, to Vulgar minds, great Provocations and Temptations to Revenge: and therefore, I do not at all wonder, that, in the great herd of the Common Lawyers, many Pragmatical spirits, whose thoughts and observations have been con∣tracted to the narrow limits of the few Books of that Profession; or within the narrower circle of the Bar Oratory; should go along with the Stream, in the Womanish art of Inveighing against Persons, when they should be Reforming Things: and that some, by degrees, having found <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Benefit of being of that Opinion (for we all remember, when Pa∣pist and Puritan Lawyers got more money than their Neighbours, for the Private Opinions they were of; not what they deliver'd in publick) grew, at last, to have Fits of Conscience in earnest; and to believe, that a Parity in the Church was necessary to Religion; and not like to produce a Parity in the State: of which Doctrine if they had been then suspected, they would quickly have been ashamed of such Divinity.</P>
<P>BUT, that Learned and Unbiass'd (I mean Unprovoked) men, in that Science of our Law; who knew the Frame and Constitution of the Kingdom, and that the Bishops were no less the Representative Body of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the Clergy, than the House of Commons was of the People; and con∣sequently, that the depriving Them of voice in parliament, was a Vio∣lence, and removing Landmarks; and not a Shaking (which might Settle again) but Dissolving Foundations; which must leave the Build∣ing unsafe for habitation: That Such men, who knew the Ecclesiastical and Civil State was so wrought and interwoven together, and, in∣truth, so incorporated in each other, that the one could not long conti∣nue in Prosper<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty without the other; and that the Professors of the Law were never at so great a height, as even in This time that They so unjustly envied the greatness of the Church: And lastly, That They, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> who might well know, that the great unweildly Body of the Clergy, consisting of such different tempers, humours, inclinations, and abili∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es; and which inevitably will have so strong an Influence upon the na∣ture
<PB N="243" REF="2630"/>
and affections of the People; could never be Regulated and Go∣vern'd by any Magistrates but of Themselves; nor by any Rules, but of such Power as the Bishops exercised; Whom (besides all arguments of Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, and submission to Antiquity) the experience of the Blessed Times Since the Reformation, not to be parallel'd in any Nation under Hea∣ven, declared to be the most Happy Managers of that Power, what∣soever rankness and excrescence might have proceeded from some Branches: I say, that these Knowing and Discerning men (for Such I must confess there have been) should believe it possible for Them to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> flourish; or that the Law if self would have the same respect and vene∣ration from the People, when the well disposed Fabrick of the Church should be rent asunder (which, without Their activity and skill in Con∣fusion, could never have been compass'd) hath been to me an Instance of the Divine Anger against the Pride of Both, in suffering them to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Fatal Engines of Breaking one another: whereas Neither could have been oppress'd by any other Strength or Power but Their Own.</P>
<P>AND I cannot but say, to the Professors of that great and admira∣ble mystery, the Common Law (upon which, no man looks with more affection, reverence, and submission) Who seem Now, by the Fury <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and Iniquity of the Time, to stand upon the ground they have won, and to be Masters of the Field; and, it may be, Wear some of the Tro∣phies and Spoils They have ravish'd from the Oppress'd; that They have Yet but sharpen'd Weapons for Others to wound them; and that Their Own Arguments and Eloquence, may be, one time or other, ap∣plied to Their Own Destruction. And therefore, if they have either Piety, to repent and redeem the Ill that they have wrought; or Policy, to Preserve their own condition from Contempt; and Themselves from being Slaves to the most abject of the People; They will, at length, wind up the Church and the Law into one and the same Interest; and, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> by a firm and steady pursuit, endeavour to fix Both on the Same Foun∣dation, from whence they have been so violently disturb'd.</P>
<P>BY this time the King was as weary of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as he had been impatient to go thither; finding all things proposed to him, as to a van∣quish'd person, without consideration of his Honour, or his Interest; and having not one Counsellor about him, but the Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> (who from the beginning carried himself by the most exact rules of Honour, Gratitude, and Fidelity to him) and very few followers; who had either affection to his Person, or respect to his Honour.</P>
<P>THAT which should have been an Act of Oblivion, was made a De∣fence <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and Justification of whatsoever They had done: Their first Tu∣mults, and erecting their Tables, in Opposition to, and at last Suppres∣sing, both Courts of Justice and Session; and the Acts and Orders of those Tables; declared to be <Q>“”the effects of their Duty to his Majesty; and according to the Law of the Land:</Q> And so all Those, who, accord∣ing to their Allegiance, had opposed and resisted them on the behalf of his Majesty, and were qualified by his Majesty's Commissions, were adjudg'd Criminal; and the only persons Excepted from Pardon, and Exempted from the Benefit of that Oblivion.</P>
<P>THE Seditious Acts of that Assembly, which had Expell'd all Bishops, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and the Canonical Clergy, from being Members of that Assembly; and affirm'd Themselves to have a Power, <Q>“”to inflict the Censures of the Church upon his Majesty himself; were declared "to be Lawful, and according to the Constitution of the Kingdom; and the Government

<P>IN consideration of the King's necessary Absence from that his Native Kingdom, it was thought fit, <Q>“”that the Full and Absolute Govern∣ment thereof, should be committed to the Lords of the Secret Coun∣cil; who were likewise made "Conservators of the Peace of the two Kingdoms, during the intervals of Parliaments;</Q> and those Lords, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Conservators, <Q>“”were then, and still, to be named by Parliament; which was once in three years to assemble upon a day certain, without any Summons from the King,</Q> if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e neglected to publish such Summons; and, upon the same reason, <Q>“”all great Officers, as Chancellor, Trea∣surer▪ Secretary, and the rest, nominated by Parliament; and in the in∣ter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al by the Lords of the Secret Council;</Q> without so much as be∣ing concern'd to have his Majesty's approbation.</P>
<P>ALL which Acts, and whatsoever else They were pleased to present to him, concerning Church or State, the King confirm'd; and there∣by, made the Lord <HI>Lowden,</HI> who had been the Principal Manager of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the Rebellion, Chancellor of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and created him likewise an Earl; and conferr'd the other great Offices, as he was directed: Then, he made the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> (for he was still trusted with conferring of Ho∣nours<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Marquis; Their great General, <HI>Lesly,</HI> Earl of <HI>Leven;</HI> and their Lieutenant-General, Earl of <HI>Calender;</HI> and conferr'd other Honours on Persons, according to the capacity and ability they had in doing him Mischief: And lastly (leaving all his Own Party barely to Live; for he had procured a Pardon for them from the Parliament, upon condi∣tion <Q>“”They came not near the King's presence; nor receiv'd any Be∣nefit from him;</Q> without Their approbation) his Majesty gave all the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Lands of the Church▪ which had been devolv'd to Him by Its ruin; and whatsoever He had else to give, in that Kingdom; to Those, who had discover'd it not to be in good hands before: So that he seem'd to have made that Progress into <HI>Scotland,</HI> only that he might make a perfect Deed of Gift of that Kingdom; which he could never have done, so ab∣solutely, without going thither. And so, having nothing more to do There, He begun his journey towards <HI>England</HI> about the middle of <HI>No∣vember.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be doubted, in consideration of those Extravagant Con∣cessions, They made as Extravagant Promises to the King; That by <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Their Loyal and Dutiful comportment, his Majesty should find no dimi∣nution of his Power: That He should have the entire obedience of that Nation, to preserve his full Rights and Regalities in <HI>England;</HI> and to reduce <HI>Ireland:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Leven</HI> telling him (as Marquis <HI>Hamilton</HI> assured me; in His hearing) <Q>“”that he would not only never more serve Against him; but that whenever his Majesty would require his Service, He should have it;</Q> without ever asking what the cause was. And many of them whispering in his ear, and assuring him, <Q>“”that as-soon as the troubles of the late Storm could be perfectly calm'd, They would Reverse and Repeal whatsoever was now unreasonably ex∣torted <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> from him.</Q> And his Majesty having never receiv'd any consi∣derable Profit from <HI>Scotland,</HI> cared the less for what he parted with There: and, it may be, being resolv'd They should be no more Charge

<P>BUT his Majesty never consider'd, or not soon enough, that They could not reasonably hope to keep, what they had so ill got, but by the same arts by which they were such gainers; and there cannot be a <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> surer evidence of the Continuance of an Enemy, than the having receiv'd Injuries from him, of a nature that do not use to be forgiven. Nei∣ther did he sufficiently weigh the unspeakable Encouragement; and, in some particulars, the reasonable Pretence the Factious Party here would have, from the Prosperous Wickedness of Those there. And, it is cer∣tain, their number from thenceforth increas'd wonderfully: the Ene∣mies of the Church presuming Their work was more than half done, when the King himself had declared (for his Consent to that Act They would easily make appear to be such) <Q>“”that the Government by Arch-Bishops, and Bishops, was against the Word of God, and the Propaga∣tion <MILESTONE N="2$" UNIT="line"/> of Religion.</Q> Many concluding the King would at last Yield to any thing, put themselves in company of the boldest and most positive Askers; and Some, who in their hearts abhor'd what the <HI>Scots</HI> had done, yet disdaining to be overwitted by them; and that They should get more for Themselves, and receive a greater argument of the King's trust, than We of this Nation; out of pure Malice to Them, resolv'd to do the same things with them; and so join'd and concurr'd in any Exorbi∣tancies.

And as they went out of the House, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> as'kd <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> <Q>“”Whether there had been a Debate? to which He answer'd, "he would take His word another time; and whisper'd him in the ear, with some asseveration, "that if the Remonstrance had been rejected, He would have sold all he had the next morning, and never have seen <HI>England</HI> more; and He knew, there were many other honest men of the same resolution.</Q> So near was the poor Kingdom at that time to its Deliverance.</P>
<P>HOWEVER They got this victory, they did not in a long time re∣cover the spirits they lost, and the agony they had sustain'd, whilst it was in suspense; and they discern'd well enough, that the House had not <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> at that time half its Members present; though They had provided, that not a man of Their Party was absent; and that they had even carried it by the hour of the night, which drove away a greater number of old and infirm Opposers, than would have made Those of the Negative Superior in number: So that They had little hope, in a Fuller House, to Prevail in any of their Unjust designs, except they found some other expedient, by hopes or fears, to work upon the affections of the several Members.</P>
<P>IN order to which, They spent most part of the next day in their Private consultations, how to Chastise some of Those who offended <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> them the day before; and resolv'd in the first place, not to suffer that Precedent to be introduced into the House, <Q>“”that men should Protest against the Sense of the House:</Q> which, it is true, had not been used in the House of Commons, This Subject was the more grateful to them, because they should heartily take Revenge upon M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde,</HI> whom they perfectly hated; and to whose activity, they imputed the trouble they had sustain'd the day before; and He was the First who made the Pro∣testation, that is, ask'd leave to do it; which produced the other sub∣sequent clamour, that was indeed in some disorder. But here they dif∣fer'd amongst themselves; all the Leading violent men, who bore the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> greatest sway, were most glad of the occasion, as it gave them opportu∣nity to be rid of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde;</HI> which they passionately desired: but S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham, Cholmondley,</HI> and <HI>Stapleton</HI> (who never sever'd, and had a numerous Train attending their motions) remember'd the Service M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> had done against the Court of <HI>York</HI> (the overthrowing where∣of was Their peculiar glory) and would not consent that they should question Him; but were ready to concur with them in the Prosecution of any other of the Protestors; whereof there was number enough. This made so great a Difference amongst them, that for the present they a∣greed no further, than <Q>“”that they would that Afternoon only provide, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that the next morning they would fall upon that matter▪</Q> and then they might consult together at night, what person they would Sacrifice.</P>
<P>ABOUT Three of the Clock, when the House met, M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> <Q>“”la∣mented the Disorder of the night before, which, he said, might pro∣bably
<PB N="248" REF="2680"/>
have engaged the House in Blood, and had proceeded principal∣ly from the offering a Protestation; which had been never before of∣fer'd in That House; and was a Transgression that ought to be severe∣ly Examin'd, that Mischief might not result hereafter from that Pre∣cedent: and therefore proposed. That the House would the next morn∣ing enter upon that Examination; and in the mean time, men might recollect themselves, and They who used to take Notes, might peruse their Memorials; that the Persons who were the chief causes of the Disorder,</Q> might be named, and defend themselves the best they could: and with this resolution the House arose; the vexation of the night be∣fore, <MILESTONE N="1$" UNIT="line"/> being very visible in the looks and countenance of many. Nei∣ther that nights deliberation; nor all the Artifice or Importunity that could be used, could remove the obstinate Northern men from their re∣solution; They declared positively, <Q>“”That if they Prosecuted M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Hyde,</HI> They,</Q> and all their Friends, would engage in his Defence: which made the Others resolve, not to incur the danger or inconvenience of such a Schism; and so they unanimously agreed upon Another person, whom they would accuse.</P>
<P>THE next morning, They first enlarged upon the Offence it self; <Q>“”of the Mischief it had like to have produced; and would unavoidably <MILESTONE N="2$" UNIT="line"/> produce, if the custom or liberty of it were ever admitted; That it was the First time it had ever been offer'd in That House; and that care ought to be taken, that it should be the Last; by severe Judge∣ment of the House, upon Those persons who had begun the Pre∣sumption.</Q></P>
<P>M<SUP>r</SUP> HYDE, who had then known nothing of the Private consulta∣tion; and had many reasons to believe Himself to be design'd; stood up (notwithstanding some Signs made to him at a distance by his Northern Friends, which he understood not) and said, <Q>“”It concern'd him to Ju∣stify what he had done, being the First man who mention'd the Prote∣station: <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> upon which, there was a general Noise and Clamour "to Withdraw; and as great, "to Speak: He proceeded, and said, "He was not old enough to know the Ancient Customs of That House; but, that He well knew, it was a very Ancient Custom in the House of Peers; and Leave was never denied There to any man, who ask'd that he might Protest, and enter his Dissent, against any Judgement of the House, to which he would not be understood to have given his Con∣sent: That He did not understand any reason, why a Commoner should not have the same Liberty, if he desired not to be involv'd in any Vote, which he thought might possibly be Inconvenient to him. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> That He had not offer'd his protestation against the Remonstrance, though he had opposed it all he could, because it remain'd still within those Walls; That he had only desired leave to Protest against the Printing it; which He thought, was not in many respects Lawful for Them to do;</Q> and might prove very Pernicious to the Publick Peace,</P>
<P>THEY were very much offended with all he said, and his assurance in speaking; and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Strode</HI> could not contain himself from saying, <Q>“”that That Gentleman had confess'd that He had First proposed the Pro∣testation;</Q> and therefore desired, He might Withdraw; which many Others likewise call'd for: till S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> appear'd with some <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> warmth against it; and young <HI>Hotham,</HI> his Son, <Q>accused <HI>Jeffery Palmer</HI> “”of giving the cause of Disorder, by saying, <HI>I do Protest,</HI> without asking the Leave of the House; and encouraging Others to cry out

every man,</Q> <HI>I do Protest:</HI> whereupon, They all fell into great Noise and Confusion; and so, without much more discourse, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Palmer</HI> was call'd upon "to Explain; which, as He was about to do, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> (who lov'd him much; and had rather have suffer'd Himself, than that He should) spoke, to the Orders of the House; and said, <Q>“”That it was Against the Orders and Practice of the House, that any man should be call'd upon to Explain, for any thing he said in the House Two days before; when it could not be presumed, that his Own Memory could Recollect all the words he had used; or, that any body else could Charge <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> him with them; and appeal'd to the House, whether there was any Precedent of the like.</Q> And there is no doubt, there never had been; and it was very Irregular. But They were too positively resolv'd to be diverted; till, after two hours Debate, He himself desired, <Q>“”that, to save the House further trouble,</Q> he might Answer, and Withdraw; which he did. When it drew towards Night, after many hours Debate, it was order'd, "that he should be committed to the Tower; the an∣gry men pressing, with all their power, <Q>“”that he might be Expell'd the House;</Q> having born him a long grudge, for the civility He shew'd in the Prosecution of the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> that is, that He had not used <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the same reproachful language which the Others had done: but They were at last glad to compound for his bare commitment to the Tower; from whence he was within few days enlarged, and return'd again to the House.

<P>THEY remember'd him <Q>“”of Charging the Kingdom by Billetting of Soldiers, and by raising of Coat and Conduct money for those Soldiers, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> in the Second and Third years of his Reign; of his Dissolving the Parliament, in h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Second year, after Their declaration of an intent to grant Five Subsidies; and the exacting those five Subsidies after∣wards by a Commission of Loan; upon the refusal whereof, divers Gen∣tlemen were Imprison'd, whereof some Died, by the Diseases they contracted in that Imprisonment; of great Sums raised by Privy-Seals:</Q> and of an attempt to set the Excise on foot.</P>

<P>THEY repeated <Q>“”the extravagant Censures of the Star-chamber, whereby the Subject had been oppress'd, by Fines, Imprisonments, Stigmatizing, Mutilations, Whippings, Pillories, Gags, Confinements, Banishments; the Severe and Illegal Proceedings of the Council-Ta∣ble, and Other new erected Judicatories; and the Suspensions, Ex∣communications, and Deprivations, of Learned and Pious Ministers, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> by the H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh Commission Court; which grew to that Excess of Sharp∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss and Severity, that They said it was not much less than the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Inquisition,</Q></P>

<P>THEN They magnified Their own Services: <Q>“”That having found the Kingdom groaning under these Difficulties, which seem'd to be insuperable, They had, by the Divine Providence, overcome them all; That They had abolish'd Ship-money, and all Monopolies; and had taken away that which was the Root of all those Evils, the Arbitrary <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Power of Taxing the Subject, pretended to be in the King: That the Living Grievances▪ the Evil Counsellors, were so quell'd, by the Justice done to the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> the Flight of the Lord <HI>Finch,</HI> and Secretary <HI>Windebank;</HI> the Accusation and Imprisonment of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and other Delinquents; that it was not like to be only an Ease to the Present Times, but a Preservation to the Future.</Q></P>

<PB N="252" REF="2720"/>
undertook the charge of the Army, which cost above fifty thousand pounds a month, It was given to the King, for that it was his Majesty's Army, and the Commanders and Soldiers under contract with Him; and that, when They undertook to Pay their Brethren of <HI>Scotland</HI> three hundred thousand pounds, It was to repair the Damages and Losses They had sustain'd by his Majesty and his Ministers; and that those particulars,</Q> amounted to above Eleven hundred thousand pounds.</P>
<P>THEN They negligently and perfunctorily pass'd over his Majesty's Graces and Favours; <Q>“”as being little more than in Justice He was obliged to grant; and of no considerable Loss and Damage to Himself: and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> promised the good People shortly Ease in the matter of Protections, (by which, the Debts from Parliament men, and their Followers and Dependents, were not recoverable) and speedily to pass a Bill to that purpose.</Q></P>

For, by this means, a Handful of men, much inferior in the beginning, in number and interest, came to give Laws to the Major part; and to shew that Three Diligent persons, are really a Greater and more Significant number, than Ten Unconcern'd, They, by Plurality of Voices, in the end, converted or reduced the Whole Body to Their opinions. It is true, Men of Activity and Faction, in any design, have many Advantages, that a Composed and Settled Council, though indu∣strious <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> enough, usually have not; and some, that Gallant men cannot give themselves leave to entertain: for, besides Their through consider∣ing and forming their Counsels before they execute them; They con∣tract a habit of Ill Nature and Disingenuity necessary to Their assairs, and the temper of Those upon whom they are to work, that Liberal minded men would not perswade themselves to entertain, even for the Pre∣vention of all the Mischief the Others intend. And whosoever observes, the Ill Arts by which These men used to prevail upon the People in general; Their absurd, ridiculous Lying, to win the affections, and cor∣rupt the understandings, of the Weak; and the bold Scandals, to con∣firm <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Wilful; the boundless Promises They presented to the Ambi∣tious; and Their gross, abject Flatteries, and Applications, to the Vul∣gar Spirited; would hardly give himself leave to use those Weapons, for the Preservation of the Three Kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE King had at that time a greater Disadvantage (besides the con∣currence of ill and extraordinary accidents) than Himself, or any of his Progenitors, had ever had before; having no Servant, of the House of Commons, of Interest, Ability, and Reputation, and of Faithfulness and Affection to his Service: S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Jermyn,</HI> who was very Honest to him, and of good Abilities, through his indisposition of health, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> trouble of mind for his Son's misfortune, having left the House, and the Court, and being retired into the Country; and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Harry Vane</HI> (who was the other only Privy-Counsellor) having committed those Faults to the King, he knew could not be forgiven; and those Faults to the Country, could not be forgotten; gave himself entirely to the disposi∣tion of his new Masters: and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Saint-John,</HI> who at the beginning was made Sollicitor General; and thereby, had obliged himself by a par∣ticular Oath, <Q>“”to Defend his Majesty's Rights; and in no case to be of Counsel,</Q> or give Advice, to the Prejudice of the King, and the Crown; was the Chief Instrument, to Devise and Contrive all the Propositions, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and Acts of Undutifulness towards him. So that, whilst These men, and Their Consorts, with the greatest deliberation, consulted, and disposed themselves to compass Confusion; They, who out of the most abstracted Sense of Loyalty to the King, and Duty to their Country, sever'd from
<PB REF="2740"/>
any relations to the King's service, or hopes from the Court, preserv'd their own Innocence, and endeavour'd to uphold the good old frame of Government, receiv'd neither countenance nor conduct, from Those who were naturally to have taken care of that province. And sure, the Raging and Fanatick Distemper of the House of Commons (to which all other distempers are to be imputed) must most properly be attributed, to the Want of Such good Ministers of the Crown in that Assembly, as being Unaw'd by any Guilt of their Own, could have watch'd Other men's; and inform'd, encouraged, and influenced Those, who stood well inclined to the Publick Peace. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>TO which purpose, if that Stratagem (though none of the best) of winning men by Places, had been practised, assoon as the resolution was taken at <HI>York</HI> to call a Parliament (in which, it was apparent, dan∣gerous attempts would be made; and that the Court could not be able to resist those attempts) and if M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Pym,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hollis,</HI> had been then Preferr d, with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Saint-John;</HI> before they were despe∣rately embark'd in their desperate designs; and had Innocence enough about them, to trust the King, and be trusted by him; having yet contracted no Personal animosities against him: it is very possible, that They might either have been made Instruments to have done good <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Service; or at least been restrain'd, from endeavouring to Subvert the Royal Building, for supporting whereof They had been placed as prin∣cipal Pillars.</P>
<P>BUT the Rule the King gave himself (very reasonable at any other time) that They should First do Service, and compass this or that thing for him, before they should receive Favour, was Then very unseasona∣ble: since, besides that They could not intruth do him that Service without the qualification, it could not be expected They would desert that Side, by the Power of which They were sure to make themselves considerable, without an unquestionable mark of interest in the Other, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> by which They were to keep up their Power and Reputation: and so, whilst the King expected They should manifest their inclinations to His Service, by their Temper and Moderation in those Proceedings that most offended him; and They endeavour'd, by doing all the Hurt they could, to make evident the Power They had to do him Good; He grew so far Disobliged, and provoked, that he could not in Honour Gratify them; and They so Obnoxious, and Guilty, that they could not think themselves Secure in his Favour: and thence, according to the Policy and Method of Injustice, continued to Oppress that Power They had In∣jured; and to raise a Security for Themselves, by Disabling the King <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to question their transgressions.</P>

But to their Petition, He told them, <Q>“”That if They would make that Wicked and Malignant Party, whereof they complain'd, known to his Majesty, He would be as ready to Suppress and Punish it, as They could Be to Complain; That by <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> those Counsellors whom He had exposed to Trial, He had given suffi∣cient testimony, that there was no man so near him, in place or af∣fection, whom he would not leave to the Justice of the Law, if They should bring sufficient Proofs, and a particular Charge against him; in the mean time, He wish'd them to forbear such general Aspersions, as since they named None in Particular, might reflect upon All his Council; That for the Choice of his Counsellors, and Ministers of State, it was the natural Liberty all Freemen have, and the undoubted Right of the Crown, to call Such to his Secret Council, and Publick Employment, as He should think fit; yet He would be careful, to <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> make election of Such, as should have given good testimonies of their Abilites and Integrity, and against Whom, there could be no just cause of Exception; That for the depriving the Bishops of their Votes in Parliament, They should consider, that Their Right, was grounded upon the Fundamental Law of the Kingdom, and constitution of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR what concern'd Religion, Church Government, and the re∣moving unnecessary Ceremonies, if the Parliament should advise him to call a National Synod, He should consider of it, and give them due Satisfaction therein; declaring His resolution, to maintain the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Doctrine and Discipline establish'd by Law▪ as well against all invasions of Popery, as from the irreverence of Schismaticks and Separatists; wherewith, of late, this Kingdom and this City abounds, to the great dishonour and hazard both of Church and State; for the Suppression of whom,</Q> his Majesty required Their timely and active assistance.</P>
<P><Q>“”TO Their desire concerning <HI>Ireland,</HI> He told them, He much doubted, whether it was Seasonable to declare resolutions of that nature, before the events of the War were seen; however, He thank'd them for their advice; and conjured them, to use all possible diligence and expedition in advancing the Supplies thither; the Insolence and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Cruelty of the Rebels daily increasing.</Q></P>
<P>THE graciousness and temper of this Answer, made no impression on them; but They proceeded in their usual manner; framing and en∣couraging, underhand, those whispers, by which the Rebellion in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> might be understood to receive some extraordinary countenance from the Court of <HI>England;</HI> the scandal whereof, They knew, would quickly fall upon the Queen.</P>
<P>AT this time, the diligence and dexterity of the Lord Mayor, caused an Address to be prepared to his Majesty, from the Court of Aldermen; which was sent by the two Sheriffs, and two Others of that Body; by <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> which, "his Majesty was humbly desired to reside at <HI>White-Hall:</HI> which angred the Governing Party, as much as Their kind reception had done.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affair<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>Ireland</HI></NOTE> THE Letters out of <HI>Ireland</HI> were very importunate for relief, of Men, Money, and Provisions; the Rebels very much increasing and taking courage, from the slow proceeding Here for their suppression: which indeed was not advanced equal to mens expectations; though the King, upon his first coming to the Houses after his return from <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> with great earnestness recommended it to them. Only, the Pro∣positions made from <HI>Scotland,</HI> <Q>“”for the sending ten thousand men from Thence, into <HI>Ulster,</HI></Q> to be paid by the Parliament, were consented to; whereby some Soldiers were dispatch'd thither, to defend Their <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Own Plantation; and did intruth, at Our Charge, as much Oppress the <HI>English</HI> that were There, as the Rebels could have done; and had upon the matter the sole Government of that Province committed to them, the chief Towns and Garrisons which were kept by <HI>English</HI> being deli∣ver'd into Their hands.

It cannot be supposed, that there could be Then a Scarcity of Men, or that it could be hard, within three Months after the Disband∣ing the Northern Army, to bring together as Many men as they had oc∣casion to use: but Their business was to get Power, not Men; and therefore, this Stratagem was used, to transfer the Power of Pressing men from the King, to Themselves; and to get the King, that He might be Now Able to raise men for <HI>Ireland,</HI> to Disable himself from Pres∣sing, upon any Other occasion. For, in the Preamble of this Bill which They sent up to the Lords (as They had done before, the first Act for Tonnage and Poundage) They declared, <Q>“”That the King had in no case, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> or upon any occasion, but the Invasion from a Forreign Power, Au∣thority to Press the Free-born Subject; which could not consist with the Freedom and Liberty of his person.</Q></P>

And the Atturney General took the Courage, <Q>“”to desire the Lords (as He should often have done in other cases) "that He might be heard, on the King's behalf, before They consented to a Clause so <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Prejudicial to the King's Prerogative.</Q> This necessary stop was no sooner made, than the Commons laid aside the consideration of <HI>Ireland▪</HI> order'd their Committee, "to meet no more about that business; the Levies which were then making of Voluntiers, stood still; and They de∣clared,

<P>IN the mean time, Letters came every day from <HI>Ireland,</HI> passionate∣ly bemoaning Their condition; and multitudes of Men, Women, and Children, who were despoil'd of their Estates, and forced into this King∣dom for want of Bread, spoke more lamentably than the Letters.

and agreement; and that his Majesty ought not to pro∣pound any condition, provision, or limitation, to any Bill, or Act, in debate or preparation, in Either House of Parliament; or to declare His consent or dissent, His approbation or dislike, of the same, before it be presented to him in due course of Parliament. They declared, That all those Priviledges had been lately broken, to Their great sor∣row and grief, in that Speech which his Majesty had made to them; wherein He took notice of a Bill for Pressing of Soldiers, not yet a∣greed upon; and offer'd a <HI>Salvo Jure,</HI> and provisional clause, to be added <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to it, before it was presented to him: and therefore They besought him, by his Regal Power to Protect them, in Those and the Other Pri∣viledges of his High Court of Parliament; and that He would not, for the time to come, break or interrupt them; and that, for the Re∣paration of them in that Their Grievance and Complaint, He would declare and make known the Name of such Person, by whose Mis∣information, and Evil Counsel, his Majesty was induced to the same, that he might receive condign Punishment. And this They did de∣sire, and as his greatest and most faithful Council did advise, his Maje∣sty to perform; as a great advantage to him, by procuring and con∣firming <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> a Confidence and Unity betwixt his Majesty and his Peo∣ple▪ &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>AND having deliver'd this Petition, They no more consider'd <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> till this manifest Breach should be repair'd; which They resolv'd nothing should do, but the Passing the Bill: and therefore, when the King offer'd, by a message sent by the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> <Q>“”That He would take care, by Commissions which He would grant, that ten thousand <HI>English</HI> Voluntiers should be speedily raised, for the service of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI></Q> if the Houses would declare that They would Pay them; the overture was wholely rejected: They neither being willing that such a <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> body of men should be raised by the King's direction (which would pro∣bably be more at His devotion than They desired) nor in any other way than They proposed: and so in the end (after other Ill Accidents<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whereupon, the Bill con∣cerning Pres∣sing, Pass'd.</NOTE> intervening, which will be remembred in order) He was compell'd to Pass the Bill concerning Pressing which They had prepared.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, for all This, and the better, it may be, for all this; the King, upon his arrival at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> found Both his Houses of Parlia∣ment of a much better Temper than They had been; Many having great Indignation, to see his Majesty so Ill treated by his Own Servants, and Those, who were most obliged to his bounty and magnificence; and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> likewise to discern, how much Ambition and Private Interest, was co∣ver'd under Publick Pretences. They who were Intruth zealous, for the Preservation of the Laws, the Religion, and True Interest of the Na∣tion, were sollicitous, to Preserve the King's Honour from any indigni∣ty, and his Regal Power from violation; and so allways opposed Those who intrench'd upon Either, and who could compass Their ends by no other means than by trampling upon Both. So that, intruth, That which was call'd the King's Party, in Both Houses, was made up of Per∣sons who were Strangers, or without any Obligation, to the Court; of the best Fortunes, and the best Reputation, in their several Countries <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> where they were known; as having allways appear'd very Zealous in the maintainance of their Just Rights, and Opposed, as much as in Them lay, all Illegal and Grievous Impositions: whilst His own Privy-Coun∣cil (Two or Three only excepted) and much the greater number of all
<PB N="260" REF="2800"/>
his own Servants, either Publickly Opposed, or Privately Betray'd him; and so much the more virulently abhor'd all Those who now appear'd to carry on His Service, because They presumed to undertake, at least endeavour (for They undertook nothing, nor look'd for any Thanks for their labour) to do That which Themselves ought to have done; and so They were upon this Disadvantage, that whenever They press'd any thing in the House, which seem'd immediately to advance the King's Power and Authority, some of the King's Council, or his Servants, most opposed it, under the notion <Q>“”of being Prejudicial to the King's In∣terest:</Q> whilst They who had used to govern and impose upon the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> House, made a shew of being more modest, and yet were more insolent; and endeavour'd, by setting new Counsels on foot, to entangle, and en∣gage, and indeed to over-reach the House; by cozening them into Opinions which might hereafter be applicable to Their Ends, rather than to pursue Their old Designs, in hope to obtain in the end a Success by their Authority. The Night of the Remonstrance had humbled them in that point: and from that time, They rather contrived ways to Si∣lence Those who opposed them; by traducing them Abroad, or taking advantage against them in the House, for any Expressions They used in Debate which might be misinterpreted; and so calling them to the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Bar, or committing them to the Tower: which did intruth strike such a Terrour into the minds of many, that They forbore to come to the House, rather than expose themselves to many Uneasinesses there.</P>

<P>THE House kept a long Silence after the motion, the newness of it amusing most men, and few intruth understanding the meaning of it; un∣till one, and another of the Members, who were least taken notice of, seeming to be moved by the weight of what had been said, enlarged upon the same argument: and in the end it was proposed, <Q>“”That a Com∣mittee might be appointed, to consider of the Present State of the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Militia, and the Power of it; and to prepare such a Bill for the Settling it, as might provide for the Publick Peace, and for the Suppressing any Forreign Enemy,</Q> or Domestick Insurrection.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This debated.</NOTE> HEREUPON, They were inclined to nominate a Committee, to pre∣pare such a Bill as should be thought necessary: Upon which, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> spoke against the making any such Committee; said, <Q>“”There could be no doubt, that the Power of the Militia resided in the King, in Whom the Right of making War and Peace was invested; that there had never Yet appear'd any Defect of Power, by which the Kingdom had <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> been in Danger, and we might reasonably expect the same Secu∣rity for the future.</Q> With which the House seem'd well satisfied, and composed, and inclined to go on upon some other Debate; untill <HI>Saint-John,</HI> the King's Sollicitor, and the Only man in the House of his

<P>IT was now evident enough, that the Debate was not begun by chance, but had been fully deliberated; and what Use They would make upon occasions, of those Volumes of Votes, They had often poured <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> out upon all accidental Debates; and no man durst take upon him to Answer all that had been alledg'd, by saying, all those Votes were of no Validity; and that the King's Right was, and would be, judg'd the same it had been before, notwithstanding those Votes; which is very true: But this being urged by the King's own Sollicitor, They appointed Him<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is appoint∣ed to bring in a Bill to Settle that matter;</NOTE> "to bring in and prepare such a Bill as He thought necessary; few men imagining, that such a Sworn Officer would not be very careful and tender of all his Master's Prerogatives, which He was expresly Sworn to Defend.</P>

<P>HEREUPON, the Lords send again to the House of Commons, to join with them in their Declaration; and many Members of that House complain'd, <Q>“”that they could not come with safety to the House; and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> that some of them had been assaulted, and very ill entertain'd, by those People that crowded about the door.</Q> But this Conference could not be procured; the Debate being still put off to some other time; after se∣veral Speeches had been made in Justification of them, and Commenda∣tion of their affections: Some saying, <Q>“”They must not Discourage their Friends,</Q> This being a time They must make use of All friends; M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> himself saying, <Q>“”God forbid the House of Commons should pro∣ceed, in any way, to Dishearten people to obtain their Just Desires in Such a way.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords di∣rect a Writ so be issued out to appoint Watches.</NOTE> IN the end, the Lords required the advice of the Judges, <Q>“”what <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> course was Legally to be taken, to Suppress and Prevent those Disor∣ders;</Q> and thereupon, directed the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, <Q>“”to issue out a writ, upon the Statute of <HI>Northampton,</HI> to the Sheriff and Justices, to appoint strong Watches in such places as They judg'd most convenient,</Q> to hinder that unlawful conflux of People to <HI>West∣minster,</HI> to the disturbance of Their consultations.

<P>UPON this encouragement, all the Factious and Schismatical People <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> about the City and Suburbs, assembled themselves together with great licence; and would frequently, as well in the night as the day, convene themselves, by the sound of a Bell, or other token, in the Fields, or some convenient place, to consult, and receive Orders from Those by whom they were to be disposed. A meeting of this kind being about the time we speak of in <HI>Southwark,</HI> in a place where their Arms and Ma∣gazine for that Burrough was kept; the Constable, being a sober man, and known to be an Enemy to those acts of Sedition, went among them, to observe what they did; he was no sooner espied, but he was reproach'd with disdainful words, beaten, and dragg'd, in so barbarous <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> a manner, that he hardly escaped with his life.

<P>THESE Insurrections by this means were so Countenanced, that no industry or dexterity of the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Richard Gour∣ney,</HI> could give any Check to them; but instead thereof, Himself (with great and very notable courage Opposing all Their Fanatick humours, both in the Court of Aldermen and at the Common Council) grew to be reckon'd in the First Form of the <HI>Malignants</HI> (which was the term <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> They imposed upon all Those They meant to render Odious to the Peo∣ple) insomuch, as His House, was no less Threatned and Disquieted by the Tumults, than the House of Lords: and when He apprehended some of Those who were most notorious in the Riot, and committed them to the custody of Both the Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> in Person, to be car∣ried to <HI>Newgate,</HI> They were, by the power and strength of their Com∣panions, Rescued from Them in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> and the Two Sheriffs com∣pelled to Shift for their own safety.

<P>ALL this time the King (who had been with great Solemnity invited by the City of <HI>London,</HI> and desired to make his Residence nearer to Them than <HI>Hampton-Court)</HI> was at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> where, besides his or∣dinary Retinue, and menial Servants, many Officers of the late Dis∣banded Army, who Sollicited Their remainder of Pay from the Two Houses, which was secured to Them by Act of Parliament, and expected some farther imployment in the War with <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon observation, and view of the Insolence of the Tumults, and the Danger, that they might possibly bring to the Court, offer'd themselves for a Guard to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Officers Repell the Rabble about <HI>White-Hall.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> his Majesties Person; and were with more Formality, and Ceremony entertained by Him, than upon a just computation of all distempers, was by many conceived Seasonable. And from these Officers warm with indignation at the Insolences of that vile Rabble, which every day passed by the Court, first Words of great Contempt, and then, those words commonly finding a Return of equal Scorn, Blows were fastened upon some of the most Pragmatical of the Crew. This was looked upon by the House of Commons like a Levying War by the King, and much pity expressed by Them, that the poor People should be so used, who came to Them with Petitions (for some few of them had received <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> some Cuts, and Slashes, that had drawn Blood) and that made a great argument for Reinforcing their Numbers.

They were Both of great Authority in the House; neither of them of any re∣lation to the Court; and therefore what They said made the more Im∣pression; and They were frequent Speakers. The Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> was
<PB N="268" REF="2880"/>
wonderfully beloved by all who knew him, as a man of Excellent Parts, of a Wit so Sharp, and a Nature so Sincere, that nothing could be more Lovely. The Other was generally esteemed as a good Speaker, being a man of an Universal Understanding, a Quick Comprehension, a Won∣derful Memory, who commonly Spoke at the end of the Debate; when he would recollect all that had been said of Weight on all sides with great exactness, and express his own Sense with much clearness, and such an application to the House, that no man more gathered a general Concurrence to his Opinion than he; which was the more notable, be∣cause his Person, and manner of Speaking were ungracious enough; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> so that He prevailed only by the strength of his Reason, which was inforced with Confidence enough.</P>
<P>THE King knew Them to be of good Esteem in the House, and good Affections to his Service, and the quiet of the Kingdom; and was more easily perswaded to bestow those Preferments upon Them, than the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> was to accept that which was designed to him. No mancould be more Surprized than He was, when the first Intimation was made to him of the King's purpose: He had never proposed any Such thing to himself, nor had any Veneration for the Court, but only Such a Loyalty to the King as the Law required from him. And He had naturally a <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Wonderful Reverence for Parliaments, as believing them most Solli∣citous for Justice, the Violation whereof in the least degree he could not forgive any Mortal Power: and it was only his Observation of the Disin∣genuity, and want of Integrity in this Parliament, which lessened that Reverence to it, and had disposed him to cross, and oppose Their designs: He was so totally unacquainted with business, and the forms of it, that He did believe really he could not Execute the Office with any Sufficien∣cy. But there were Two Considerations that made most Impression upon him; the One, lest the world should believe, that his own Ambition had procured this Promotion, and that he had therefore appeared Signally <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in the House to Oppose those Proceedings, that he might thereby ren∣der himself gracious to the Court: The Other, lest the King should expect such a Submission, and Resignation of himself, and his own rea∣son, and judgment to his Commands, as he should never give, or pre∣tend to give; for he was so severe an adorer of Truth, that he could as easily have given himself leave to Steal as to Dissemble; or to Suf∣fer any Man to think that he would do any thing, which he Resolved not to do; which he thought a more mischeivous kind of lying, than a positive averring, what could be most easily contradicted.</P>
<P>IT was a very difficult task to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde,</HI> who had most credit with <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Him, to perswade Him to Submit to this purpose of the King's chear∣fully, and with a just Sense of the Obligation, by Promising that in those Parts of the Office, which required most Drudgery, he would help him the best he could. But above all he prevailed with him, by inforcing the Ill consequence of his refusal to take the Office, which would be inter∣preted to his dislike of the Court, and his Opinion, that more would be required from him than he could Honestly comply with, which would bring great Prejudice to the King. On the other hand, the great Benefit that probably would redound to the King, and the Kingdom, by his accepting such a Trust in such a general defection, by which he <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> would have opportunity to give the King a truer Information of his own Condition, and the State of the Kingdom, than it might be presumed had been given to him, and to prevent any Counsels or Practice, which
<PB N="269" REF="2890"/>
might more alienate the affections of the People from the Government; and then, that by this Relation He would be more able to do the King Service in the House, where He was too well known to have it believed, that He Attained to it by any unworthy Means or Application. In the end, He was perswaded to Submit to the King's good Pleasure, tho' he could not be prevailed with to accept it with so good a grace, as might raise in the King any Notable Expectation of his departing from the Severity of his own Nature.</P>
<P>THUS, He and <HI>Colepepper</HI> were both invested in those Offices, to the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> no small displeasure of the Governing Party, which could not dissemble their Indignation, that any of Their Members should Presume to re∣ceive those Preferments, which they had designed otherwise to have disposed of. They took all opportunities to express their dislike of Them, and to Oppose any thing they Proposed to Them. And within few days there came a Letter out in Print, pretended to be Intercepted, as written from a Roman Catholick to another of the same Profession, in which he gives an account, <Q>“”That They had at last, by the interest of their Friends, procured those two Honourable Persons (before men∣tioned) "to be preferred to those Offices, and that they were well as∣sured <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that they would be ready to do Them, and all their Friends, all good Offices.</Q> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Colepepper</HI> thought fit to take notice of it in the House, and to make those Professions of his Religion, which he thought necessary. But the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> chose rather to Contemn it, with∣out taking notice of the Libell, well knowing that he was Superior to those Calumnies, as indeed he was; all of that Profession knowing that He was most Irreconcilable to their Doctrine, tho' He was always Ci∣vil to their Persons. However grievous this Preferment was to the angry part of the House, it was very grateful to all those, both within and without the House, who wished well to the King, and the Kingdom.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> THE King at the same time Resolved to remove another Officer, who did disserve him notoriously, and to Prefer M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> to that place, with which his Gracious intentions his Majesty acquainted him, but he positively refused it, and assured him, <Q>“”That He should be able to do much more Service in the condition he was in, than he should be, if that were improved by any Preferment, that could be conferred upon him at that time; and he added, "that he had the Honour to have much Friendship with the two Persons, who were very Seasona∣bly advanced by his Majesty, when his Majestys Service in the House of Commons, did intruth want some Countenance, and Support; and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> by his conversation with Them, he should be so well instructed by Them, that he should be more useful to his Majesty, than if it were under a nearer relation and dependence. The King, with a very Gra∣cious Countenance, told him, "that he perceived he must, for sometime, defer the laying any Obligation upon him; but bid him be assured he would find both a Proper Time, and a Suitable Preferment for him, which he should not refuse. In the mean time, he said, he knew well the Friendship between the two Persons, whom he had taken to his Council, and him; which was not the least motive to him to make that choice; and that he would depend as much upon His Advice, as <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> upon either of Theirs; and therefore wished that all Three would Con∣fer together, how to Conduct his Service in the House, and to advise his Friends how to carry themselves most to the advantage of it, and to give him constant Advertisement of what had Passed, and Counsel
<PB N="270" REF="2900"/>
when it was fit for him to do any thing; and Declared, that He would do nothing, that in any degree concerned, or related to his Service in the House of Commons, without their joynt Advice, and exact Communication to them of all his own Conceptions;</Q> which, without doubt, his Majesty did at that time stedfastly Resolve, tho' in very few days he did very Fatally swerve from it.</P>
<P>BY what hath been said before, it appears that the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was much trusted by the King, and he was of great familiarity, and friend∣ship with the other Three, at least with Two of Them; for he was not a Man of that Exactness, as to be in the entire Confidence of the Lord <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Falkland,</HI> who looked upon his infirmities with more Severity than the other Two did; and he liv'd with more Frankness towards those Two, than he did towards the Other: Yet even between those two there was a free Conversation, and Kindness to each other. The Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was a man of very Extraordinary parts by Nature and Art, and had surely as good and excellent an Education as any man of that Age in any Coun∣try: A Graceful and Beautiful Person; of great Eloquence and Becom∣ingness in his discourse save that sometimes he seemed a little affected) and of so Universal a Knowledge, that he never wanted Subject for a dis∣course: He was equal to a very good part in the greatest Affairs, but the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> unfittest man alive to conduct them, having an ambition, and vanity Superior to all his other parts, and a confidence in himself, which some∣times intoxicated, and transported, and exposed him. He had from his Youth, by the disobligations his Family had undergone from the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and the great men who succeeded him, and some sharp reprehension himself had met with, which obliged him to a Country Life, contracted a prejudice, and ill will to the Court; and so had in the beginning of the Parliament, engaged himself with that Party, which discovered most aversion from it, with a Passion and Animosity equal to theirs, and therefore very acceptable to Them. But when he was <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> weary of their violent Counsels, and withdrew himself from them with some circumstances, which enough provoked them, and made a Re∣conciliation, and mutual Confidence in each other for the future, mani∣festly impossible amongst them; he made private and secret offers of his Service to the King, to whom in so general a defection of his Ser∣vants, it could not but be very agreeable; and so his Majesty being sa∣tisfied both in the Discoveries he made of what had passed, and in his Professions for the future, removed him from the House of Commons, where he had rendred himself marvellously ungracious, and called him by Writ to the House of Peers, where he did visibly Advance the King's <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Service, and quickly rendred himself grateful to all those, who had not thought too well of him before, when he deserved less; and men were not only pleased with the Assistance he gave upon all Debates, by his Judgment and Vivacity, but looked upon him, as one, who could de∣rive the King's Pleasure to them, and make a lively representation of their good demeanour to the King, which he was very luxuriant in pro∣mising to do, and officious enough in doing as much as was Just.</P>
<P>HE had been instrumental in promoting the Three Persons above mentioned to the King's favour; and had himself intruth so great an Esteem of them, that he did very frequently, upon Conference toge∣ther, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> depart from his own Inclinations and Opinions, and Concurred in Theirs; and very few men of so great parts were, upon all occasions, more Counsellable than he; so that he would seldom be in danger of running
<PB N="271" REF="2910"/>
into great Errors, if he would communicate, and expose all his own thoughts, and inclinations to such a disquisition; nor was he uninclina∣ble in his Nature to such an entire communication in all things, which he conceived to be difficult. But his Fatal infirmity was, that he too often thought difficult things very easy; and considered not possible con∣sequences, when the Proposition administred somewhat that was delight∣ful to his Fancy, by pursuing whereof he imagined he should reap some Glory to himself, of which he was immoderately Ambitious; So that if the consultation were upon any Action to be done, no man more impli∣citly <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> entred into that Debate, or more chearfully resigned his own con∣ceptions to a joynt determination: But when it was once affirmatively resolved (besides that he might possibly reserve some impertinent cir∣cumstance, as he thought, the imparting whereof would change the na∣ture of the thing) if his Fancy suggested to him any particular, which himself might perform in that Action, Upon the imagination that every body would approve it if it were proposed to them, he chose rather to Do it, than Communicate it, that he might have some Signal part to himself in the Transaction, in which no other Person might claim a share.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> BY this unhappy temper he did often involve himself in very un∣prosperous Attempts. The King himself was the unfittest Person alive to be served by Such a Counsellor, being too easily inclined to suddain Enterprizes, and as easily Startled when they were entred upon. And from this unhappy composition in the One, and the Other, a very un∣happy Counsel was proposed, and resolution taken, without the least communication with either of the Three, who had been so lately ad∣mitted to an entire Trust.</P>
<P>THE Bishops, who had been, in the manner before spoken of, driven, and kept from the House of Peers, and not very Secure in their own, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> could not have the patience to Attend the Dissolution of this Storm, which in wisdom They ought to have done: but considering Right and Reason too abstractly, and what in Justice was due, not what in Pru∣dence was to be expected; suffer'd Themselves implicitly to be guided by the Arch-Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> who was of a restless, and overweening Spirit, to such an Act of indiscretion, and disadvantage to Themselves, that all their Enemies could not have brought upon Them. This Bishop, as it is said, was a man of a very Imperious and fiery Temper; D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Williams,</HI> who had been Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> in the time of King <HI>James.</HI> After his removal from that Charge, He <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> had lived Splendidly in his Diocess, and made himself very popular amongst those, who had no reverence for the Court; of which he would frequently, and in the presence of many, speak with too much Free∣dom, and tell many Stories of Things and Persons upon his own former Experience; in which, being a man of great Pride and Vanity, He did not all ways confine himself to a precise Veracity, and did often presume in those unwary discourses, to mention the Person of the King with too little Reverence. He did affect to be thought an Enemy to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> whose Person he seemed exceedingly to contemn, and to be much displeased with those Ceremonies and Innovations, as <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> they were then called, which were countenanced by the Other; and had himself published, by his own Authority, a Book against the using those Ceremonies, in which there was much good Learning, and too lit∣tle Gravity for a Bishop. His Passion and his Levity, gave every day
<PB N="272" REF="2920"/>
great advantages to those who did not love him, and He provoked too many, not to have those advantages made use of: So that, after several Informations against Him in the Star-Camber, He was Sentenced, and Fined in a great sum of money to the King, and committed Prisoner to the Tower, without the pity, or compassion of any, but those, who, out of hatred to the Government, were sorry that they were without so useful a Champion; For He appeared to be a man of a very corrupt Nature, whose Passions could have transported Him into the most un∣justifiable Actions.</P>
<P>HE had a Faculty of making relations of things done in his own <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Presence, and discourses made to himself, or in his own hearing, with all the circumstances of answers, and replies, and upon Arguments of great Moment; all which, upon Examination, were still found to have nothing in them, that was Real, but to be the pure effect of his own Invention. After He was Sentenced in the Star-Chamber, some of his Friends resorted to him, to lament, and condole with him for his mis∣fortune, and some of them seemed to wonder that in any Affair of such a Nature, He had not found means to have made some Submission, and Composition, that might have prevented the publick Hearing, which proved so much to his Prejudice in point of Reputation, as well as Pro∣fit. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> He answered them with all the formality imaginable, <Q>“”that they had reason indeed to wonder at him upon the Event; but when they should know how he had governed himself, He believed they would cease to think him worthy of blame. And then related to them, "that assoon as Publication had passed in his Cause, and the Books were taken out, he had desired his Council (who were all able men, and some of them very Eminent) in the Vacation time, and they at most leasure, to meet together, and carefully to look over, and peruse all the Evidence, that was taken on Both sides; and that then they would attend him such a morning, which he appointed upon their consent, at his own <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> House at <HI>Westminster:</HI> That they came at the time appointed; and being then shut up in a Room together, He asked them, whether they had sufficiently perused all the Books, and were throughly informed of his Case? To which they all answered, that they had not only read them all over together, but had severally every man by himself perused them again, and they believed they were all informed of the whole. That He then told them he had desired this Conference with them, not only as his Council, by whose opinion he meant to govern himself, but as his particular Friends, who, he was sure, would give him their best Advice, and perswade him to do every thing as they would do them∣selves, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> if They were in His Condition. That he was now offer'd to make his Peace at Court, by such an humble Submission to the King, as he was most inclined, and ready to make; and which he would make the next day after his Cause was Heard, tho' he should be Declared to be Innocent, of which he could make no doubt; But that which troubled him, for the present, was, that the Infamousness of the Charge against him, which had been often Exposed, and Inlarged upon in several mo∣tions, had been so much taken notice of through the Kingdom, that it could not consist with his Honour to divert the Hearing, which would be imputed to his want of Confidence in his Innocence, since men did <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> not suspect his Courage, if he durst rely upon the other; but that he was Resolved, as he said before, the next day after he should be Vindi∣cated from those Odious Aspersions, he would cast himself at the King's
<PB N="273" REF="2930"/>
feet, with all the humility, and submission, which the most Guilty man could make profession of. It was in this point he desired their Advice, to which he would, without adhereing to his own Inclina∣tion, entirely conform himself; and therefore desired them, Singly in order, to give him their Advice. He repeated the Several, and Distinct discourse every man had made, in which he was so Punctual, that he applied those Phrases, and Expressions, and Manner of Speech to the Several men, which they were all taken notice of Frequently to use; as many men have some Peculiar Words in discourse, which they <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> are most delighted with, or by custom most addicted to: and in Con∣clusion, that they were Unanimous in their judgments; that he could not, with the preservation of his Honour, and the opinion of his Integrity, decline the Publick Hearing; where he must be un∣questionably declared innocent; there being no Crime, or Misd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mea∣nour proved against him in Such a manner, as could make him liable to Censure: they All commended his resolution of Submitting to the King assoon as he had made his Innocence to appear; and they All advised him to pursue that Method. This, he said, had S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yed him: and made him decline the Other Expedient, that had been pro∣posed <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to him.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Relation wrought upon Those, to whom it was made, to raise a Prejudice in them against the Justice of the Cause, or the Reputation of the Council, as they were most inclined; whereas there was not indeed the least shadow of Truth in the whole Relation; except that there was Such a Meeting, and Conference, as was mentioned, and which had been consented to by the Bishop upon the joint desire, and importunity of all the Council; Who, at that Conference, Unan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mously advised and desired him <Q>“”to use all the Means and Friends he could, that the Cause might Not be brought to Hearing: but that he should <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> purchase his Peace at any Price; for that if it were Heard, he would be Sentenced very grievously; and that there were many things Proved against him, which would so much reflect upon his Honour, and Reputation, and the more for being a Bishop, that all his Friends would abandon him; and be for ever after Ashamed to appear on his behalf. Which Advice with great Passion,</Q> and Reproaches upon the Several Persons for their presumption, and ignorance in matters so much above Them, he utterly and Scornfully rejected. Nor indeed was it possible, at that time, for him to have made his Peace; for tho', upon some former Addresses, and Importunity on his behalf by some <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Persons of Power, and Place in the Court, in which the Queen her self had endeavoured to have done him good Offices, the King was inclined to have saved him, being a Bishop, from the Infamy he must undergo by a Publick Trial; yet the Bishops Vanity had, in those conjunctures, so far transported him, that he had done all he could to have insinuated, <Q>“”that the Court was ashamed of what they had done; and had pre∣vailed with some of his Powerful Friends to perswade him to that composition:</Q> upon which the King would never hear more Any per∣son, who Moved on His behalf.</P>
<P>IT had been once mentioned to Him, whether by Authority, or no, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> was not known, <Q>“”that his Peace should be made, if he would resign his Bishoprick, and Deanery of <HI>Westminster</HI> (for he had That in Com∣mendam) "and take a good Bishoprick in <HI>Ireland;</HI> which he positively refused; and said, "he had much to do to defend himself against the
<PB N="274" REF="2940"/>
Arch-Bishop Here; but if he was in <HI>Ireland,</HI> There was a Man (mean∣ing the Earl of <HI>Strafford)</HI> who would cut off his Head within one Month.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Bishop had been for some years in the Tower, by the Sentence of the <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> before this Parliament met; when the Lords, who were the most Active and Powerful, presently resolved to have him at Liberty. Some had much Kindness for him; not only as a known Enemy to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> but as a Supporter of Those Opinions and Those Persons, which were against the Church it self. And he was no sooner at Liberty, and brought into the House, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> but, as has been before mention'd, he defended, and seconded the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> when he made an Invective with all the malice, and bitterness imaginable, against the Arch-Bishop then in Prison; and when he had concluded, that Bishop said; <Q>“”that he had long known that noble Lord, and had all ways believed him to be as well affected to the Church as Himself;</Q> and so he continued to make all his Address to that Lord, and Those of the same party. Being now in full Liberty, and in some Credit, and Reputation, he applied himself to the King; and made all possible professions of Duty to his Majesty, and Zeal to the Church; protesting <Q>“”to have a perfect Detestation of Those Persons, who ap∣peared <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to have no Affection or Duty towards his Majesty, and of all evil intentions against the Religion Establish'd; and that the Civility he had expressed towards them, was only out of gratitude for the good will They had shewed to Him; and especially that he might the bet∣ter promote his Majestys Service.</Q> And it being his Turn shortly after, as Dean of <HI>Westminster,</HI> to Preach before the King; he took oc∣casion to speak of the Factions in Religion; and mentioning the Presby∣terian Discipline, he said, <Q>“”it was a Government only fit for Taylors, and Shoemakers, and the like:</Q> not for Noblemen, and Gentlemen: which gave great Scandal, and Offence to his great Patrons; to whom <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> he easily reconciled himself, by making Them as merry with some Sharp Sayings of the Court, and by performing more Substantial Offices for them.</P>
<P>WHEN, upon the Trial of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> it was resolved to decline the Judgment of the House of Peers, and to proceed by Bill of Attainder; and there upon it was very unreasonably Moved, <Q>“”that the Bishops might have no Vote in the passing that Act of Parliament; because they pretended it was to have their hand in Blood, which was against an old Canon;</Q> This Bishop, without communicating with any of his Brethren, very Frankly declared his opinion, <Q>“”that they ought <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> not to be present;</Q> and offered, not only in his own Name, but for the rest of the Bishops, <Q>“”to withdraw allways when That business was enter'd upon:</Q> and so betrayed a Fundamental Right of the whole Or∣der; to the great Prejudice of the King, and to the taking away the life of that Person, who could not otherwise have Suffer'd.</P>
<P>AND shortly after, when the King declared, that he neither would, nor could in Conscience, give his Royal Assent to that Act of Attainder; when the Tumults came about the Court with noise and clamour for Justice; the Lord <HI>Say</HI> desired the King to confer with his Bishops for the Satisfaction of his Conscience; and desired him to to speak with That <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Bishop in the point. After much discourse together, and the King in∣sisting upon many particulars, which might induce others to consent; but were known to Himself to be False; and therefore he could never
<PB N="275" REF="2950"/>
in conscience give his own consent to them; The Bishop, as hath been mentioned before, amongst other Arguments, told him; <Q>“”that he must consider, that as he had a Private Capacity, and a Publick, so he had a Publick Conscience as well as a Private; that though his Pri∣vate Conscience, as a Man, would not permit him to do an Act con∣trary to his own Understanding, Judgment, and Conscience; yet his Publick Conscience, as a King, which obliged him to do all things for the Good of his People, and to preserve his Kingdom in Peace for Himself and his Posterity, would not only Permit him to do That, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> but even Oblige, and Require him. That he saw in what Commo∣tion the People were; that his own Life, and that of the Queens, and the Royal Issue might probably be Sacrificed to that Fury; and it would be very strange, if his Conscience should prefer the life of one Single Private Person how Innocent soever, before all those other Lives, and the preservation of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was the argumentation of that unhappy Casuist; who truely, it may be, did believe himself; for towards the end of the War, and when the King's power declined; he, being then an Arch-Bishop, did in Person assist the Rebels to take a Castle of the King's; in which there <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> was a Garison, and which was taken by a long Siege; because he might thereby the better enjoy the Profits of his own Estate, which lay thereabouts.</P>
<P>UPON all these great Services He had performed for the Party, he grew every day more Imperious; and after the King thought it neces∣sary to make him Arch-Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> which, as the time then was, could not qualify him to do more harm, and might possibly dispose, and oblige him to do some good; he carried himself so Insolently, in the House and out of the House, to all persons, that he became much more Odious universally, than ever the other Arch-Bishop had been; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> having sure more Enemys than He, and few or no Friends, of which the Other had abundance. And the great hatred of this Man's Person and Behaviour, was the greatest invitation to the House of Commons so irregularly to Revive that Bill to remove the Bishops; and was their chief incouragement to hope, that the Lords, who had rejected the Former, would now Pass, and consent to this Second Bill.</P>
<P>THIS was one of the Bishops, who was most rudely treated by the Rabble; who gathered themselves together about the House of Peers, crying out <HI>No Bishops, No Bishops:</HI> and his Person was assaulted, and Robes torn from his back; upon which, in very just displeasure, he re∣turned <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to his house, the Deanery at <HI>Westminster;</HI> and sent for all the Bishops, who were then in the Town (it being within very few days of <HI>Christmass)</HI> of which there were Twelve or Thirteen; and, in much Passion, and with his Natural Indignation, he proposed as absolutely necessary; <Q>“”that they might Unanimously, and Presently prepare a Protestation, to send to the House, against the Force, that was used upon them; and against all the Acts, which were, or should be done during the time, that They should by Force be kept from doing their Dutys in the House.</Q> And Immediately, having Pen and Ink ready. Himself prepared a Protestation; which being read to them, they all <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> approved; depending upon His great experience in the Rules of the House, where he had sate so many years, and in some Parliaments in the place of Speaker, whilst he was Keeper of the Great Seal; and so presuming, that He could commit no errour in Matter or Form: and
<PB N="276" REF="2960"/>
without further communication, and advice, which both the Impor∣tance of the Subject, and the Distemper of the time did require; and that it might have been considered as well what was Fit, as what was Right; without further delay, than what was necessary for the fair Writing, and Ingrossing the Instrument, they had prepared; they all set their hands to it. Then the Arch-Bishop went to <HI>White-Hall</HI> to the King, and presented the Protestation to Him; it being directed to his Majesty with an Humble Desire, that He would send it to the House of Peers, since They could not present it Themselves; and that he would command, that it should be Enter'd in the Journal of the House. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> His Majesty casting his eye perfunctorily upon it, and believing it had been drawn by Mature Advice, no sooner received it, than he delivered it to the Lord Keeper, who unfortunately happened to be likewise pre∣sent, with his command that he should deliver it to the House as soon as it met: which was to be within two hours after. The Petition con∣tained these words,</P>
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Petition and Protesta∣tion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King and House of Lords</NOTE> To the King's most excellent Majesty; and the Lords and Peers now assembled in Parliament.</L></Q>

<P>IT was great pity, that, tho' the Arch-Bishops Passion transported him, as it usually did; and his Authority imposed upon the rest, who had no affection to his Person, or reverence for his Wisdom; his Ma∣jesty did not take a little time to consider of it, before he put it out of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> his Power to alter it, by putting it out of his Hands. For it might easily have been discerned by Those, who were well acquainted with the Humour, as well as the Temper of both Houses, that some advantage, and Ill Use would have been made of some Expressions contained in it; and that it could produce no Good Effect. But the same Motive and Apprehension, that had precipitated the Bishops to so hasty a Resolution (which was, that the House of Peers would have made that use of the Bishops being kept from the House, that they would in that time have passed the Bill it self for taking away their Votes) had its effects like∣wise with the King; who had the same imagination, and therefore <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> would lose no time in the transmission of it to the House. Whereas it is more probable, the Lords would never have made use of that very Season, whilst the Tumults still continued, for the Passing Act of that importance; and the Scandal, if not Invalidity of it, would have been an Unanswerable ground for the King to have refused his Royal Assent to it.</P>
<P>ASSOON as this Protestation, which, no doubt, in the time before the House was to meet, had been communicated to Those who were prepared to speak upon it, was Delivered by the Lord Keeper with his Majestys Command, and Read; the Governing Lords manifested a great <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Satisfaction in it; Some of them saying, <Q>“”that there was <HI>`Digitus `Dei</HI> to bring That to pass, Which they could not Otherwise have com∣passed;</Q> and without ever Declaring any Judgment or Opinion of their own upon it, which they ought to have done, the matter only having

The House of Com∣mons took very little time to consider of the matter; but, within half an hour, they sent up to the Lords; and, without further Examination,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> accused them all, who had Subscribed the Protestation, of High-Trea∣son; and, by this means, they were all, the whole Twelve of them, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> committed to Prison; and remained in the Tower till the Bill for the putting them out of the House was Passed, which was not till many Months after.</P>
<P>WHEN the Passion, Rage, and Fury of this time shall be forgotten, and Posterity shall find, amongst the Records of the Supream Court of Judicature, so many Orders, and Resolutions in vindication of the Li∣berty of the Subject against the Imprisoning of any man, tho' by the King Himself, without assigning Such a Crime as the Law hath deter∣mined to be worthy of Imprisonment; and in the Same Year, by this high Court, shall find Twelve Bishops, Members of This Court, com∣mitted <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to Prison for High-Treason, for the Presenting This Protestation; Men will surely wonder at the Spirit of that Reformation: and even that Clause of Declaring all Acts Null, which had been, or should be done in Their Absence, in defence of which no man Then durst open his Mouth, will be thought good Law, and good Logick; not that the Presence of the Bishops in that time was so Essential, that no Act should Pass without them; which had given them a Voice, upon the matter, as Negative as the Kings; and Themselves, in their Instrument, Dis∣claimed the least Pretence to Such a qualification; but because a Vio∣lence, offer'd to the Freedom of any One Member, is a Violation to all <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Rest: as if a Council consist of Threescore, and the door to that Council be kept by Armed men, and all Such, whose Opinions are not liked, kept out by force; no doubt the Freedom of Those Within is in∣fringed, and all Their Acts as Void and Null, as if they were Locked in, and kept without meat till they alter'd their Judgments.</P>
<P>AND therefore you shall find in the Journals of the most Sober Par∣liaments, that, upon any eminent Breach of Their Priviledges, as all∣ways upon the Commitment of any Member for any thing Said or Done in the House, sometimes upon less occasions, that House, which appre∣hended the Trespass, would sit mute, without Debating, or Handling <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> any business, and then Adjourn; and this hath been practised many days together, till they had Redress or Reparation. And their Reason was, because their Body was Lame; and what was befallen One Member, threaten'd the Rest; and the consequence of one Act might extend it self to many other, which were not in view; and this made their Pri∣viledges of so tender, and nice a temper, that they were not to be Touch∣ed, or in the least degree Trenched upon; and therefore that in so ap∣parent an Act of Violence, where it is not more clear that they were committed to Prison, than that they durst not then Sit in the House, and when it was Lawful in the House of Peers for every dissenter in <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the most Trivial debate, to enter his Protestation against that sense he liked not, tho' he were Single in his opinion; That it should Not be Lawful for Those, who could not Enter it Themselves, to Present this
<PB N="279" REF="2990"/>
Protestation to the King, to whom they were accountable under a Pe∣nalty for their Absence; and unlawful to that degree, that it should render them culpable of High-Treason; and so forfeit their Honour, their Lives, their Fortunes, expose their Names to perpetual Infamy, and their Wives and Children to Penury, and want of bread; will be looked upon as a Determination of that Injustice, Impiety, and Horrour, as could not be believ'd without those deep marks, and prints of Con∣fusion that followed, and attended That Resolution.</P>
<P>AND yet the Indiscretion of Those Bishops, swayed by the Pride, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and Passion of that Arch-Bishop, in applying that Remedy at a time, when they saw all Forms and Rules of Judgment impetuously declined; and the power of their Adversaries so great, that the Laws themselves submitted to their Oppression; that They should, in Such a Storm, when the best Pilot was at his prayers, and the Card, and Compass lost, with∣out the advice of one Mariner, put themselves in such a Cock-boat, and to be severed from the good Ship, gave that Scandal and Offence to all those, who passionately desired to preserve their Function, that they had no compassion, or regard of their Persons, or what became of them; insomuch as in the whole Debate in the House of Commons, there was <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> only one Gentleman, who spoke on their behalfs, and said; <Q>“”he did not believe they were guilty of High-Treason, but that they were Stark Mad;</Q> and therefore desired they might be sent to <HI>Bedlam.</HI></P>
<P>THIS high, and extravagant way of proceeding brought no Prejudice to the King; and tho' it made their Tribunal more terrible to men who laboured under any Guilt, yet it exceedingly lessened the Reve∣rence and Veneration, that formerly had been entertained for Parlia∣ments: and this last Accusation, and Commitment of so many Bishops at Once, was looked upon by all Sober men with Indignation. For whatever Indiscretion might be in the thing it self, tho' some Expres∣sions <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in the matter might be Unskilful and Unwarrantable, and the Form of presenting and transmitting it, Irregular and Unjustifiable (for all which the House of Peers might punish their Own Members, according to their discretion) yet every man knew there could be no Treason in it; and therefore the end of their Commitment, and the use all men saw would be made of it, made it the more Odions; and the Members, who were absent from both Houses, which were Three parts of Four, and many of those who had been present, Abhorred the Proceedings, and attended the Houses more diligently; so that the Angry Party, who were no more treated with, to abate their Fury, would have been com∣pelled <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to have given over all their Designs for the Alteration of the Go∣vernment both in Church, and State; if the Volatile, and Unquiet Spi∣rit of the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> had not prevailed with the King, contrary to his Resolution, to have given Them some New Advantage; and to depart from his purpose of doing nothing, without very mature Deliberation.</P>
<P>THO' S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Balfour,</HI> who is allready mentioned, had, from the beginning of this Parliament, forgot all his Obligations to the King; and had made himself very Gracious to those people, whose glory it was to be thought Enemies to the Court; and, whilst the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was his Prisoner, did many Offices not becoming the Trust he had from the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> King, and contributed much to the Jealousy, which that Party had of his Majesty; upon which there had been a long resolution to remove him from that Charge; but to do it with his own Consent, that there might be no manifestation of Displeasure; yet it was a very unseasonable

Conjuncture, which was taken to execute it in; and this whole Trans∣action was so secretly carried, that there was neither notice nor suspi∣tion of it, till it was heard, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Lunsford</HI> was Sworn Lieute∣nant of the Tower; a man, who, tho' of an ancient Family in <HI>Sussex,</HI> was of a very small, and decayed Fortune, and of no good Education; having been few years before, compelled to fly the Kingdom, to avoid the hand of Justice for some riotous Misdemeanour; by reason whereof, he spent some time in the service of the King of <HI>France,</HI> where he got the reputation of a Man of Courage, and a good Officer of Foot; and in the beginning of the Troubles here had some Command in the King's <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Army; but so much inferior to many others, and was so little known, except upon the disadvantage of an Ill Character, that, in the most Duti∣ful time, the Promotion would have appeared very ingrateful. He was utterly a Stranger to the King, and therefore it was quickly understood to proceed from the Single election of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> to whom he was likewise very little known; who had intruth designed that Office to his Brother S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Lewis Dives,</HI> against whom there could have been no exception, but his Relation: but He being not at that time in Town, and the other having some secret Reason to fill that place in the Instant, with a man who might be trusted; he suddainly resolved upon this <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Gentleman, as one, who would be Faithful to him for the obligation, and execute any thing he should desire, or direct; which was a reason he might easily have foreseen would provoke more powerful Opposi∣tion: which errour, as is said before, was repaired by the suddain change, and putting in S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>John Byron;</HI> tho▪ it gave little satisfaction, and the less, by reason of another more inconvenient Action, which changed the whole Face of Affairs, and caused This to be more reflected upon.</P>

<P>THE House of Peers was somewhat appalled at this Alarum; but took time to consider of it, till the next day, that they might see how their Masters the Commons would behave themselves; the Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> being present in the House, and making great professions of his Inno∣cence; and no Lord being so hardy to press for his Commitment on the behalf of the King▪</P>
<P>AT the same time, a Serjeant at Arms demanded to be Heard at the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Arms de¦mands the five M m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Commons</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> House of Commons from the King; and being sent for to the Bar, de∣manded the Persons of five of their Members to be delivered to him in his Majestys Name, his Majesty having accused them of High-Treason. But the Commons were not much surprized with the Accident; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or be∣sides that they quickly knew what had passed with the Lords, some Ser∣vants of the King, by especial Warrant, had visited the Lodgings of some of the accused Members, and Sealed up their Studies and Trunks; upon information whereof, before that Serjeant came to the House, or Publick notice was taken of the accusation, an Order was made by the Com∣mons; <Q>“”that if any person whatsoever should come to the Lodgings of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> any Member of that House, and there offer to Seal the Doors, Trunks, or Papers of such Members, or to Seize upon their Persons; that then such Member should require the aid of the next Constable, to keep such persons in safe Custody, till the House should give further Order: that if any person whatsoever should offer to Arrest or Detain any Member of that House, without first acquainting that House therewith, and receiving further Order from thence; it should be lawful for such Member to stand upon his Guard, and make Resistance, and for any person to assist him, according to the Protestation taken to defend the Priviledges of Parliament.</Q> And so, when the Serjeant had delivered <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> his Message, he was no more called in; but a Message sent to the King, <Q>“”that the Members should be forth coming assoon as a Legal Charge should be preferred against them;</Q> and so the House Adjourned till the next day, every one of the accused persons taking a Copy of that Order, which was made for Their Security.</P>
<P>THE next day in the Afternoon, the King, attended only by his own<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King goes to the House of Commons to demand the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</NOTE> usual Guard, and some few Gentlemen, who put themselves into their company in the way, came to the House of Commons; and command∣ing all his Attendants to wait at the Door, and give offence to no man; Himself, with his Nephew, the Prince Elector, went into the House, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to the great amazement of all: and the Speaker leaving the Chair, the King went into it; and told the House, <Q>“”he was sorry for that occasion of coming to them; that yesterday he had sent his Serjeant at Arms to Apprehend some, that, by his command, were accused of High-Treason;
<PB N="282" REF="3020"/>
whereunto he expected Obedience, but instead thereof he had received a Message. He declared to them, that no King of <HI>England</HI> had been ever, or should be more careful to maintain their Priviledges, than He would be; but that in Cases of Treason No man had privi∣ledge; and therefore he came to see if any of those persons, whom he had accused, were There; for he was resolved to have them, where∣soever he should find them: and looking then about, and asking the Speaker whether they were in the House, and he making no answer, he said, he perceived the <HI>Birds were all Flown,</HI> but expected they should be sent to him, assoon as they returned thither; and assured <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> them in the Word of a King, that he never intended any Force, but would proceed against them in a Fair, and Legal way;</Q> and so re∣turned to <HI>White-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>THE accused persons, upon information and intelligence what his Majesty intended to do, how secretly soever it was carried at Court, having withdrawn from the House about half an hour before the King came thither: the House in great disorder, assoon as the King was gone, Adjourned till the next day in the Afternoon; the Lords being in so great apprehension upon notice of the King's being at the House of Com∣mons, that the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> expressed a tender sense he had of the In∣conveniences▪ <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> which were like to ensue those Divisions; and moved, <Q>“”that the House of Peers, as a work very proper for them, would inter∣pose between the King and his People; and Mediate to his Majesty on the behalf of the persons accused;</Q> for which he was reprehended by his Friends, and afterwards Laughed at himself, when he found how much a stronger Defence they had, than the best Mediation could prove on Their behalf.</P>
<P>HOW secretly soever this Affair was carried, it was evident that the King's resolution of coming to the House had been discovered, by the Members withdrawing themselves, and by a Composedness, which ap∣peared <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in the countenances of many, who used to be disturbed at less Surprising Occurrences; and tho▪ the purpose of accusing the Members was only consulted between the King and the Lord <HI>Digby;</HI> yet it was generally believed, that the King's purpose of going to the House, was communicated to <HI>William Murry</HI> of the Bed-Chamber, with whom the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> had great Friendship; and that it was discovered by Him. And that Lord, who had promised the King to move the House for the Commitment of the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> assoon as the Atturney General should have accused him (which if he had done would probably have raised a very hot Dispute in the House, where many would have joyned <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> with him) never spoke the least word; but, on the contrary, seemed the most surprized, and perplexed with the Atturney's Impeachment; and sitting at that time next the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> with whom he pre∣tended to live with much Friendship, he whispered him in the ear with some commotion (as he had a rare talent in Dissimulation) <Q>“”that the King was very Mischievously advised; and that it should go very hard, but he would know, whence that Counsel proceeded; in order to which, and to prevent further Mischief, he would go immediately to his Majesty▪ and so went out of the House.</Q></P>
<P>WHEREAS He was the Only Person, who gave the Counsel, Named <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the Persons, and particularly the Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> (against whom less could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e said, than against many others, and who was more generally beloved) and undertook to prove that the said Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> told the

Rabble, when they were about the Parliament House, that they should go to <HI>White-Hall.</HI> When he found the ill success of the Impeachment in both Houses, and how unsatisfied all were with the proceeding; he advised the King the next Morning to go to the <HI>Guild Hall,</HI> and to in∣form the Mayor and Aldermen of the Grounds of his Proceedings; which will be mentioned anon. And that People might not believe, that there was any dejection of mind, or sorrow for what was done; the same Night, the same Council caused a Proclamation to be prepared for the stopping the Ports; that the accused persons might not escape out of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Kingdom; and to forbid all persons to receive, and harbour them; when it was well known, that they were all together in a house in the City, without any fear of their Security. And all this was done with∣out the least communication with any body, but the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who advised it; and it is very true, was so willing to take the utmost hazard upon himself; that he did offer the King, when he knew in what house they were together, with a select company of Gentlemen, who would accompany him, whereof S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Lunsford</HI> was one, to Seize upon them, and bring them away Alive, or leave them Dead in the place; but the King liked not such Enterprizes.</P>

And they were not disap∣pointed; for in spight of all the Lord Mayor could do to compose their distempers (who like a very wise, and stout Magistrate bestirred him∣self) the City was that whole night in Arms; some people, designed to that purpose, running from one Gate to another, and crying out, <Q>“”that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the <HI>Cavaliers</HI> were coming to fire the City; and some saying▪ "that the King himself was in the head of them.</Q></P>

And in his passage through the City, the Rude People flocked together, and cryed out, <HI>Priviledge of Parlia∣ment, Priviledge of Parliament;</HI> some of them pressing very near his <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> own Coach, and amongst the rest one calling out with a very loud Voice, <HI>Toyour Tents O Israel.</HI> However the King, tho' much Mortified, con∣tinued his Resolution, taking little notice of the Distempers; and, having Dined at the Sheriffs, returned in the Afternoon to <HI>White-Hall;</HI> and
<PB N="284" REF="3040"/>
published, the next day, a Proclamation, for the Apprehension of all those, whom he had accused of High Treason, forbidding any person to Harbour them; the Articles of their Charge being likewise printed, and dispersed.</P>
<P>WHEN the House of Commons next met, none of the Accused Mem∣bers appearing, They had Friends enough, who were well instructed to aggravate the late Proceedings, and to put the House into a thousand Jealousies, and Apprehensions; and every slight Circumstance carried weight enough in it to disturb their minds. They took very little no∣tice of the Accusing the Members; but the King's Coming to the House, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> which had been Never known before, and Declaring, <Q>“”that he would take Them, Wherever he Found Them, was an Evidence, "that he meant Himself to have brought a Force into the House to Apprehend them,</Q> if they had been there; and was looked upon as the highest Breach of Priviledge, that could possibly be imagined. They who spoke most Passionately, and probably meant as Maliciously, behaved them∣selves with Modesty, and seemed only concerned in what concerned them All; and concluded, after many Lamentations, <Q>“”that they did not think themselves Safe in that House, till the minds of men were better Composed; that the City was full of Apprehensions, and was <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> very Zealous for their Security; and therefore wished, that they might Adjourn the Parliament to meet in some place in the City.</Q> But that was found not Practicable▪ since it was not in their own power to do it, without the Consent of the Peers, and the Concurrence of the King; who were Both like rather to choose a place more distant from the City.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> So, with more Reason, in the end they concluded, <Q>“”that the House should Adjourn it self for two or three days, and name a Committee, who should sit both Morning and Afternoon in the City; and All who came to have Voices:</Q> and <HI>Merchant-Taylors-Hall</HI> was appointed for the place of their meeting; They who Served for <HI>London,</HI> under∣taking, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> "that it should be ready against the next Morning: no man op∣posing or contradicting any thing that was said; They, who formerly used to appear for all the Rights and Authority, which belonged to the King, not knowing what to say, between Grief and Anger, that the Violent Party had by these late Unskilful actions of the Court, gotten great Advantage, and recovered new Spirits: and the Three Persons be∣fore named, without whose Privity the King had Promised, that he would enter upon no Counsel, were so much displeased and dejected, that they were inclined, never more to take upon them the Care of any thing to be transacted in the House; finding allready, that they could <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> not avoid being looked upon as the Authors of those Counsels, to which they were so absolute Strangers, and which they so perfectly Detested.</P>

<P>IT was very well known where the Accused Persons were, all toge∣ther in one House in <HI>Coleman-Street,</HI> near the place where the Com∣mittee sate; and whither persons trusted passed to and fro to commu∣nicate, and receive Directions; but it was not Seasonable for them Yet to appear in Publick, and to come, and sit with the Committee, or to own the believing, that they thought themselves safe from the Vio∣lence, and the Assaults of the Court; the Power whereof they exceedingly Contemned, whilst they seemed to Apprehend it; nor was it yet time to Model in what manner their Friends in the City, and the Country, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> should appear concerned for them, in preparing whereof no time was lost.</P>
<P>AGAINST the day the House was to meet, the first Adjournment not being for above two or three days, the Committee had prepared Matter
<PB N="286" REF="3060"/>
enough for a Report; a Relation of all they had discovered upon their Examinations, and such Votes, as they thought fit to offer upon the breach of their Priviledge; that they might thereby discover the Af∣fections of the House, of which they could not yet take any measure, seeing there had been no Debate since those Accidents, which could dis∣cover the General Temper; which, they well enough knew, was not before to their Advantage. In the mean time, they used all the ways they could to Asperse those, who used to Oppose them, as the Contrivers of the late Proceedings; and were willing they should know it; which they imagined, would restrain them from taking the same Liberty, they <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> had used to do.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Votes of the House of Commons upon their fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st meeting again.</NOTE> AND so at Their meeting in the House, upon the Report of the Committee, they declared, <Q>“”that the King's Coming to the House, and Demanding the Persons of divers Members thereof to be delivered unto him, was a high Breach of the Rights and Priviledges of Par∣liament▪ and Inconsistent with the Liberty and Freedom thereof; and therefore that they could not with the Safety of their own Persons, or the Indemnity of the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, Sit there any longer, without a full Vindication of so high a Breach, and a sufficient Guard, wherein they might Confide; and for that reason, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> did order, that their House should be again Adjourned for four days; and that the Committee should meet in the same place, to Consider and Resolve of all things, that might concern the Good and Safety of the City, and the Kingdom; and particularly, How their Priviledges might be Vindicated, and their Persons Secured; and should have power to Consult and Advise with any person, or persons touching the Premises.</Q> And, this Order and Declaration being made, they Ad∣journed: the last Clause being intended to bring their Members to them.</P>
<P>At the Meeting of the House, the Committee had informed them, First of the great Civilities, they had received from the City in all the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> particulars, that they might have Order to return the thanks of the Whole House, which they easily obtained; and, at their return, they took more Examinations than they had formerly; by which they made a fuller Relation of the King's Coming to the House▪ and his Carriage and Words there. And because it was Visible to all men, that the King was so far from bringing any Force with him, which they desired it should be believed he had brought, that he had only his Guard of Hal∣berdiers, and fewer of them, than used to go with him on any ordi∣nary Motion; and that fewer of his Gentlemen Servants were Then with him, than usually attended him, when he went but to walk in the Park; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and had only their Little Swords; they were very Punctual in men∣tioning any Light or Loose words, which had fallen from any man, that it might be believed, that there was more in the Matter. As they carefully inserted in their Relation, that one of the Waiters, as he walked very near his Majesty through the Hall, said, <Q>“”he had a good Pistol in his Pocket;</Q> and that another, as they were walking up the Stairs to∣wards the House of Commons, called out, <HI>Fall on;</HI> from which they would have it believed, that there had been very Bloody Intentions.</P>
<P>THEN they proposed some Votes to be offer'd to the House, in which they Voted <Q>“”the Relation, which was made, to be true; and thereupon, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that the King▪s Coming to the House was the highest Breach of the Priviledge of Parliament, that could be made; and that the Arresting, or endeavouring to Arrest, any member of Parliament was a high
<PB N="287" REF="3070"/>
B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each of their Priviledge; and that the Person, who was so Arrested, might lawfully Rescue, and Redeem himself; and that all, who were Present, and saw the Priviledge of Parliament so Violated, might, and Ought to assist the Injured person in his Defence, and to procure his Liberty with Force.</Q> And these Votes the House confirmed, when they were Reported. Tho', in the Debate, it was told them, <Q>“”that they m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st take heed, that they did not out of Tenderness of their Priviledge, which was, and must be very precious to every man, extend it fur∣ther, than the Law would suffer it to be extended: that the House had <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> allways been very severe upon the Breach of any of their Priviledges, and in the Vindicating those Members, who were Injured; but that the disposing men to make Themselves Judges, and to rescue them∣selves or others, might be of evil Consequence, and produce ill Ef∣fects▪ at least if it should fall out to be, that the persons were arrested for Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, or Felony, or Breach of the Peace; in either of which Cases,</Q> there could be no Priviledge of Parliament. This, tho' a known Truth to any, who knew any thing of the Law, was received with Noise and Clamour, and with wonderful evidence of Dislike, and some faint Contradictions, <Q>“”that no Such thing ought to be done, whilst a Parlia∣ment <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> was Sitting:</Q> and then, falling upon the late Action of the King, and the Merit of those persons, and without much Contradiction, which was found to be Ingrateful, the House Confirmed all that the Committee had Voted; and then Adjourned again for some days, and Ordered the Committee to meet again in the City; which they did Morning and Afternoon; and prepared other Votes of a brighter Allay, and more in the face of the King, and the Law, every day adding to the Fury and Fierceness of the precedent. The House met and Sate, only to Confirm the Votes which were passed by the Committee, and to prosecute Such Matters, as were by Concert brought to them, by Petition from the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> City; which was ready to Advance any thing, they were directed; and so whilst the Members yet kept themselves Concealed, many particu∣lars of great Importance were transacted in those Short Sittings of the House.</P>
<P>THE King about this time, having found the Inconvenience and Mis∣chief to himself of having no Servant of Interest and Reputation, and who took his business to Heart, in the House of Commons, had made the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> both Members of that House, and of unblemished Reputations and confessed Abilitys, of his Privy-Council; and the one, the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> his Principal Secretary of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> State, and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> Chancellor of the Exchequer; as is said before. And so, having now gotten two Counsellors about him, who durst Trust one another, and who were Both fit to be Trusted by Him, which he had been without above a Year past, to His, and the King∣doms irreparable Disadvantage; he thought fit to Publish a Declaration to all his Subjects, in Answer to the Remonstrance, he had lately received from the House of Commons, and was dispersed throughout the Kingdom. In which, without the least Sharpness or return of the Lan∣guage, he had received; he took notice "of the Fears, and Jealousies<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer to the House of Com∣mon's former Remonstrance.</NOTE> (for those were the New words, which served to Justify all Indisposi∣tions, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and to excuse all Disorders) <Q>“”which made Impression in the minds of his People, with reference to their Religion, their Liberty, or their Civil Interests.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”As to their Religion, He observed the Fears to be of Two sorts;
<PB N="288" REF="3080"/>
either as Ours here established might be invaded by the Roman Party; or as it was accompanied with some Ceremonies, at which some ten∣der Consciences, or Really were, or Pretended to be Scandalized. For the first, as there might be any suspition of Favour or Inclination to the Papists, he said, he was willing to Declare to all the World, that, as he had been brought up from his Childhood in, and practised that Religion, which was Established in the Church of <HI>England;</HI> so he be∣lieved he could, having given a good part of his time and pains to the Examination of the Grounds of it, as it Differ'd from that of <HI>Rome,</HI> maintain the same by Unanswerable Reasons; and hoped he should be <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> ready to Seal it with the effusion of his Blood, if it should please God to call him to that Sacrifice: and that nothing could be so acceptable to him, as any Proposition, which might contribute to the Advance∣ment of it Here, or the Propagation of it Abroad; this being the greatest means to draw down a Blessing from God upon himself, and this Nation; and if this Profession of his was wanting to his People, he thought himself extreamly Unfortunate, for that his constant Pra∣ctice in his own Person had allways been, without Ostentation, as much to evidence his Care and Duty therein, as he could possibly tell how to express.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P><Q>“”AS for matters of Ceremony, He said, he would, in Tenderness to any number of his loving Subjects, be willing to comply with the ad∣vice of his Parliament, that some Law should be made for the exem∣ption of tender Consciences from punishment or prosecution for neglect∣ing such Ceremonies; and in Such Cases, which by the judgment of most men are held to be matters Indifferent, and of some to be abso∣lutely Unlawful. Provided, that that Case should be attempted, and pursued with that Modesty, Temper, and Submission, that in the mean time the Peace, and Quiet of the Kingdom should not be disturbed, the Decency, and Comeliness of God's Service not discountenanced; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> nor the Pious, Sober, and Devout actions of those Reverend persons, who were the first Labourers in the blessed Reformation, or of that time, be Scandalized, and Defamed. For, he said, he could not with∣out Grief of Heart, and without some Tax upon himself and his Mi∣nisters for the not executing of the Laws, look upon the bold Licence of some men in Printing of Pamphlets, in Preaching and Printing of Sermons so full of bitterness and malice against tbe present Govern∣ment, against the Laws Established; so full of Sedition against his own Person, and the Peace of the Kingdom; that he was many times amazed to consider by what Eyes those things were Seen, and by what <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Ears they were Heard.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”CONCERNING the Civil Liberties and Interests of the Subjects, He said, he should need say the less, having erected so many lasting Monuments of his Princely and Fatherly care of his People, in those excellent Laws passed by him this Parliament; which, with very much Content to himself, he said, he conceived to be so Large and Ample, that very many Sober men had little left to wish for of that Kind. He told them, he very well understood the Rights and parti∣cular Advantages, he had Departed from in many of the Acts he had passed;</Q> and therefore he had reason to hope, as he had taken all Oc∣casions <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to render Their condition most Comfortable and Happy; <Q>so “”They would, in grateful and dutiful return, be allways ready with equal Tenderness and Alacrity to advance His Rights, and prefer His
<PB N="289" REF="3090"/>
Honour, upon which their own Security and Subsistence so much de∣pended; and no Particular should be presented unto him for the com∣pleating, and establishing that Security, to the which he would not with the same readiness contribute his best Assistance. He said, if those Resolutions were the effects of his present Counsels, and he took God to Witness that they were such, and that his Subjects might con∣fidently expect the Benefit of them from him, certainly no ill Design upon the Publick could accompany Such resolutions; neither could there be great cause of Suspicion of any Persons preferred by him to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> degrees of Honour, and places of Trust and Imployment, since this Par∣liament: and therefore, that amongst his Misfortunes he reckoned it not the Least, that, having not retained in his Service, nor Protected any One person, against whom the Parliament had Excepted, during the whole Sitting of it, and having in all that time scarce vouchsafed to any man an instance of his Favour or Grace, but to Such, who were under some eminent Character of estimation amongst the People, there should so soon be a misunderstanding or jealousy of their Fidelity and Uprightness; especially in a time, when he took all occasions to De∣clare, that he conceived himself capable of being served only by Honest <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> men, and in Honest ways.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HOWEVER if He had been mistaken in such his Election, the Par∣ticular should no sooner be discovered to him, either by His own ob∣servation, or other certain Information, than he would leave them to Publick Justice, under the marks of his Displeasure. If notwithstand∣ing this, any Malignant Party should take heart, and be willing to Sa∣crifice the peace and happiness of their Country to their own Sinister ends and Ambitions, under what pretence of Religion and Conscience soever; if they should endeavour to lessen his Reputation and Interest, and to weaken his Lawful power and Authority with his good Sub∣jects; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> if they should go about, by discountenancing the present Laws, to loosen the bonds of Government, that all disorder and Confusion might break in, he doubted not, but God in His good Time would discover them; and the wisdom, and courage of his High-Court of Parliament would joyn with him in their Suppression, and Punish∣ment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HAVING said all He could, to express the clearness and uprightness of his Intentions, and done all he could to manifest those intentions, he said, he could not but confidently believe, all his good Subjects would acknowledge His part to be fully performed, both in Deeds past, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and present Resolutions to Do, what with Justice might be required of him; and that their Quiet and Prosperity now depended wholely on Themselves, and was in Their own power, by yielding all Obedience and due reverence to the Law; which is the Inheritance of every Sub∣ject, and the only Security he can have for his Life, Liberty, and Estate; and the which being neglected or disesteemed, under what Specious shews soever, a great measure of Infelicity, if not an irreparable Con∣fusion, must without doubt fall upon them. And he doubted not, it would be the most acceptable Declaration a King could make to his Subjects, that he was not only resolved to keep the Laws himself, but <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to maintain them against what Opposition soever, tho' with the hazard of his Being. He hoped the Loyalty, and good affections of all his Subjects, would concur with him in the constant preserving a good Un∣derstanding between him and his People; and that their own Interest,
<PB N="290" REF="3100"/>
and compassion of the lamentable condition of the poor Protestants in <HI>Ireland,</HI> would invite them to a fair Intelligence and Unity amongst themselves; that so they might, with one heart, intend the relieving, and recovering that unhappy Kingdom; where those barbarous Re∣bels practised such inhuman and unheard of Outrages upon the mi∣serable People, that no Christian ear could hear without horrour, or Story parallel. He concluded with conjuring all his good Subjects, of what Degree or Quality soever, by all the bonds of Love, Duty, and Obedience, that are precious to Good men, to joyn with him for the recovery of the Peace of That Kingdom, and the preservation of the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Peace of This; to remove all the doubts and fears, which might in∣terrupt their affection to Him, and all their Jealousies and Apprehen∣sions, which might lessen their Charity to each other; and then, he said, if the Sins of the Nation had not prepared an inevitable Judg∣ment for all, God would make him a great and glorious King over a Free, and Happy People.</Q></P>
<P>THO' this Declaration had afterwards a very good influence upon the People, to his Majesty's advantage; yet for the present it gave no allay to their Distempers. Their Seditious Ministers were dispatched to in∣flame the Neighbour Counties, and all possible art was used to inflame <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the City of <HI>London;</HI> which prevailed so far, that not withstanding all the opposition the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> the Recorder, and the gravest and most substantial Aldermen could make, the Major part of the Com∣mon Council prevailed to send a Petition to the King, in the name of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of <HI>London;</HI> which was the next Sunday Morning delivered to him, with great So∣lemnity, at <HI>White Hall</HI> by a Number chosen of that Body: Represent∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s the King.</NOTE> <Q>“”the great dangers, fears, and Distractions, the City then was in, by reason of the prevailing progress of the bloody Rebels of <HI>Ireland;</HI> the putting out of persons of Honour and Trust from being Constable and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Lieutenant of the Tower, especally in those times, and the prepara∣tions there lately made; the fortifying <HI>White-Hall</HI> with Men, and Ammunition in an unusual manner; some of which men abused, and wounded divers Citizens passing by; the calling in divers Cannoneers, and other assistance into the Tower; the discovery of divers Fireworks in the hands of Papists, and the misunderstanding between his Majesty, and the Parliament. That their fears were exceedingly increased by his Majestys late going into the House of Commons, attended by a multitude of Armed men, for the apprehending of divers Members of that House, to the indangering his own Person, and the persons, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Priviledges of that Honourable Assembly. That the effects of those fears tended not only to the overthrow of the whole Trade of that City and Kingdom, which they felt allready in a deep measure, but threaten'd the utter ruin of the Protestant Religion, and the Lives and Liberties of all his Subjects; and therefore they prayed his Majesty, that by the advice of his great Council in Parliament, the Protestants in <HI>Ireland</HI> might be speedily relieved; the Tower put into the hands of Persons of trust; that by removal of doubtful and unknown per∣sons from about <HI>White-hall,</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> a known and approved Guard might be appointed for the safety of his Majesty, and the Par∣liament; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and that the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the Five Members of the House of Commons lately accused, might not be restrained of Liberty, or otherwise proceeded against, than according to the Priviledges of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="3110"/>
THE King very well understood from what Spirit this Petition <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the inconvenience of giving so much countenance to it, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry receiving it was, if he could have avoided it. But the Torrent was too strong to be resi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted by any direct strength he could raise against it; and therefore he resolved to endeavour to divide and reduce them, by the most gracious descending to their pretended fears, and Apprehen∣sions; and the same day, gave them this Answer; <Q>“”That for the sad<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> business of <HI>Ireland,</HI> he could not possibly express a greater sense than he had done, there being nothing left on His part Unoffer'd, or Un∣done. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> For the Tower, he wonder'd that having removed a Servant of trust from that Charge, only to satisfy the fears of the City▪ and put in another of unquestionable reputation and known ability, the Pe∣titioners should still entertain those Fears; and whatsoever preparation of strength was there made was with as great an eye of Safety and ad∣vantage to the City, as to his own Person, and should be equally im∣ployed to both.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the fortifying <HI>White-Hall</HI> with Men, and Ammunition in an unusual way, He doubted not, that they had observed the strange pro∣vocation he had received to entertain that Guard; that, by the disor∣derly <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and tumultuous conflux of People at <HI>Westminster</HI> and <HI>White-Hall,</HI> his great Council was not only disquieted, but his own Royal Person in Danger; most Seditious language being uttered even under his own windows. And if any Citizens had been wounded, or ill treated, he was confidently assured, that it had happened by their own evil and corrupt Demeanours. For the Fireworks in the hands of a Papist, he knew nothing, nor understood Whom, or What They mean<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR his going to the House of Commons, when his Attendants were no otherwise armed than as Gentlemen with Swords, He was <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> perswaded, that if they knew the clear grounds, upon which Those Persons stood accused of High-Treason, and what would be proved against them, with which they should in due time be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e acquainted, and considered the Gentle way he took for their Apprehension (which he preferred before any course of Violence, tho' that way had been very Justifiable; since it was notoriously known that no Priviledge of Par∣liament can extend to Treason, Felony, or breach of Peace) they would believe his going thither was an Act of grace and favour to that House, and the most peaceable way of having that necessary Service performed; there being such Orders made for the resistance of what <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Authority soever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for their Apprehension: and for the proceedings against those persons, he ever intended the same should be with all justice and favour, according to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm; to which all Innocent men would chearfully submit. And this extra-ordinary way of satisfying a Petition of so unusual a Nature, he said, he was confident would be thought the greatest instance, could be given, of his clear intentions to his Subjects; and of the singular esteem he had of the good affections of that City, which he hoped in Grati∣tude would never be wanting to his just commands and service.</Q></P>
<P>IT was no wonder, that they, who at Such a time could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e corrupted <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to frame, and deliver Such a Petition, would not be reformed by such an Answer. Neither will it be here unseasonable, to spend a little time in considering how the affections and tempers of so rich and opulent a City, which could naturally expect to prosper only by Peace, and
<PB N="292" REF="3120"/>
agreement, were wrought upon, and transported, to that degree, as to be the chief Instruments of its own, and the Kingdoms destruction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The state and temper of the City of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> at t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me.</NOTE> THE City of <HI>London,</HI> as the Metropolis of <HI>England,</HI> by its Situation the most capable of trade, and by the most usual residence of the Court, and the fixt Station of the Courts of Justice for the publick administra∣tion thereof throughout the Kingdom, the chief seat of trade, was, by the successive countenance and favour of Princes, strengthen'd with great Charters and Immunities, and was a Corporation governed within it self; the Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen, Sheriffs, chosen by themselves; several Companies incorporated within the great Corporation; which, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> besides notable Priviledges, enjoyed Lands, and perquisites to a very great revenue. By the incredible increase of Trade, which the distra∣ctions of other Countries, and the Peace of this brought, and by the great licence of resort thither, it was, since the King's access to the Crown, in Riches, in People, in Buildings marvellously increased, insomuch as the Suburbs were allmost equal to the City; a Reformation of which had been often in contemplation, never pursued, wise men foreseeing that such a Fulness could not be there, without an Emptiness in other places; and whilst so many persons of Honour and Estates were so de∣lighted with the City, the Government of the Country must be neglect∣ed, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> besides the excess, and ill husbandry, that would be introduced there∣by. But such foresight was interpreted a Morosity, and too great an oppression upon the Common Liberty; and so, little was applied to pre∣vent so growing a Disease.</P>
<P>AS it had these, and many other advantages and helps to be Rich, so it was looked upon too much of late time as a Common Stock not easy to be exhausted, and as a body not to be grieved by ordinary Acts of injustice; and therefore as it was a place of resort, in all cases of ne∣cessity, for the suddain borrowing great sums of money, in which they were commonly Merchants too good for the Crown, so it was become a <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> practice, upon any specious pretences, to void the Security, that was at any time given for money so borrowed.</P>
<P>THUS after many questionings of their Charter, which were ever re∣moved by considerable sums of money, a Grant made by the King in the beginning of his Reign (in consideration of great sums of money) of good quantities of Land in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and of the City of <HI>Londonderry</HI> there, was voided by a Suit in the <HI>Star-Chamber;</HI> all the Lands, after a vast expence in building and planting, resumed into the King's hands, and a fine of Fifty Thousand pounds imposed upon the City. Which Sentence being pronounced after a long and publick Hearing, during <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> which time, they were often invited to a Composition, both in respect of the substance, and the circumstances of proceeding, made a general impression in the minds of the Citizens of all conditions, much to the disadvantage of the Court; and tho' the King afterwards remitted to them the penalties of that Sentence, they imputed that to the power of the Parliament, and rather remember'd how the benefit of their Grant had been taken from them, than by whom it was restored; so that, at the beginning of the Parliament, the City was as ill affected to the Court as the Country was; and therefore chose such Burgesses to sit there, as had either eminently opposed the Court, or accidentally been <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> oppressed by it.</P>
<P>THE chief Government and Superintendency of the City is in the Mayor, and Aldermen; which, in that little Kingdom, resembles the
<PB REF="3130"/>
House of Peers; and the Common Council is the representative body thereof, like the House of Commons, to order and agree to all Taxes, Rates, and such particulars belonging to the Civil policy. The Common Council are chosen every year, so many for every Parish, of the wisest, and most substantial Citizens, by the Vestry, and common convention of the People of that Parish; and as the wealthiest, and best reputed men were commonly chosen, so, tho' the Election was once a year, it was formerly scarce ever known, that any man Once chosen was after∣w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds rejected or left out, except upon discovery of an enormous crime, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and decaying in fortune to a Bankrupt: otherwise, till he was called to be Alderman, or dyed, he continued, and was every year returned of the Common Council.</P>
<P>AFTER the beginning of this Parliament, when those who steer'd at <HI>Westminster</HI> found by their experience in the Case of the Earl of <HI>Straf∣ford,</HI> of what consequence the City might be to them, and afterwards found by the courage of the present Lord Mayor, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Richard Gourney,</HI> who cannot be too often or too honourably mentioned, that it might be kept from being disposed by Them; and that the men of wealth, and ability, who at first had concurred with them, begun now to discern <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that they meant to lead them further than they had a mind to go; they directed their Confidents, that at the Election of the Common Council∣men by the concurrence and number of the meaner people, all such, who were Moderate men, and Lovers of the present Government, should be rejected; and in their places men of the most Active and Pragmatical heads, of how mean fortunes soever, should be elected. And by this means that body in great part now consisted of Upstart, Factious, Indi∣gent companions, who were ready to receive all advertisements and di∣rections from <HI>Westminster,</HI> and as forward to incroach upon their Su∣periors, the Mayor, and Aldermen. And so this firebrand of Priviledge <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> inflamed the City at that time.</P>
<P>THAT They might gratify the City in procuring a better Answer, than they had received from the King to their Petition, and that they might more expose his Majesty to their Affronts, the House resumed the business of the Tower again, with the old reflections upon the removal of the former Good Lieutenant, and the putting in a rude person and of a desperate fortune, as they called him, that he might use such Prisoners, as there was an intent to send thither, in such a manner, as he should be directed; and that the person, who was since put in, had put the City into great apprehensions by the observation that was made, that he took <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> great store of provisions into the Tower, as if he made provision for a greater Garison, which raised great jealousies; and there was a Petition brought, and delivered to the Houses in the Names of several Merchants, who used to trade to the Mint; in which they desired that there might be such a person made Lieutenant of the Tower, <Q>“”as they could Con∣fide in (an Expression that grew from that time to be much used) with∣out which no man would venture Bullion into the Mint,</Q> and by con∣sequence no Merchant would bring it into the Kingdom. Whereas in∣truth there was no Gentleman of the Kingdom of a better reputation amongst all sorts of men, and there had been more Bullion brought into <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the Mint in the short time of His being Lieutenant, than had been in many Months before; and amongst those persons, which so solemnly de∣livered that Petition, and had all subscribed it, there were very few, who had ever sent any Silver into the Mint.

<P>THEY published, that it did fully appear by several Examinations, <Q>“”that many Soldiers, Papists and others, to the number of about five hunder▪, came with his Majesty to the House of Commons, armed;
<PB N="295" REF="3150"/>
and that some of them, holding up their Pistols cocked near the door of the House, which they kept open, said, I am a good Marksman, I can hit right, I warrant you: and said, they would have the door open; and if any opposition was made, they made no question but they should maintain their Party; and that some said, "a Pox take the House of Commons, let them be Hanged. And when the King returned from the House, they expressed great discontent asking, when comes the <HI>word;</HI> that some of them being demanded what they thought the company intended to have done, answered, that question∣less <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> in the posture they were set in, if the <HI>word</HI> had been given, they should have fallen upon the House of Commons, and have cut all their throats: upon which they said they were of opinion, that the Soldiers and Papists coming in that manner with his Majesty was to take away some of the Members of the House, and if they should have found opposition, or denial, then to have fallen upon the House in a Hostile manner.</Q></P>
<P>AND they did thereupon declare, <Q>“”that the same was a Traiterous design against the King and Parliament. And whereas the persons ac∣cused had, with the approbation of the House, absented themselves <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> from the Service of the House, for avoiding the great and many in∣conveniences, which otherwise might have happened; since which time, a Printed Paper in the form of a Proclamation had issued out for the apprehending and imprisoning them, suggesting, that through the conscience of their Guilt they were absent, and fled; they did fur∣ther declare, "that the said Printed Paper, was False and Scandalous, and Illegal; and that notwithstanding that Printed Paper, or any Warrant issued out, or any other matter against them, they might and Ought to attend the service of the House, and the Committees then on foot; and that it was lawful for all persons whatsoever to lodge, harbour, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and converse with them, and whosoever should be questioned for the same should be under the Protection, and Priviledge of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>AND they declared, <Q>that the publishing the Articles of High-Trea∣son “”against the persons accused, was a high breach of the Priviledge of Parliament, a great Scandal to his Majesty, and his Government, a Seditious act manifestly tending to the Subversion of the Peace of the Kingdom, and an injury, and dishonour to the Members; and that the Priviledges of Parliament, and Liberties of the Subject so violated and broken, could not be fully, and sufficiently Vindicated, unless the King would be graciously pleased to discover the Names of those persons, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> who advised him to do the particular Acts before mentioned, that they might receive Condign Punishment.</Q></P>
<P>THIS strange Declaration, so contrary to the known rules and judg∣ments of Law, and to the known practice and proceedings of Parliament, was no sooner framed and agreed upon in the Committee, than it was printed, and published throughout the City, and Kingdom, before it was Confirmed by, or Reported to the House; which is against the custom of Parliament. For, by that custom, no Act done at any Com∣mittee should be divulged before the same be Reported to the House.</P>
<P>THE truth is, it cannot be expressed how great a Change there appear∣ed <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to be in the countenance and minds of all sorts of People, in Town and Country, upon these late proceedings of the King. They, who had before even lost their Spirits, having lost their credit, and reputation, except amongst the meanest people, who could never have been made
<PB N="296" REF="3160"/>
use of by them, when the greater should forsake them; and so despaired of ever being able to compass their designs of Malice, or Ambition (and some of them had resumed their old resolutions of leaving the Kingdom) now again recovered greater Courage than ever, and quickly found that their credit and reputation was as great as ever it had been; the Court being reduced to a lower condition, and to more disesteem, and neglect than ever it had undergone. All that they had formerly said of Plots and conspiracies against the Parliament, which had Before been laughed at, was Now thought true and real; and all their fears, and jealousies looked upon as the effects of their great Wisdom, and Foresight. All <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> that had been Whispered of <HI>Ireland,</HI> was now talked Aloud and Printed; as all other Seditious Pamphlets and Libels were. The Shops of the City generally shut up, as if an Enemy were at their Gates ready to en∣ter, and to plunder them; and the People in all places at a Gaze, as if they looked only for Directions, and were then disposed to any un∣dertaking.</P>
<P>ON the other side, They, who had, with the greatest courage and ala∣crity, opposed all their Seditious practises, between Grief and Anger were confounded with the consideration of what had been done, and what was like to follow. They were far from thinking that the accused <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Members had received much Wrong, yet they thought it an Unseason∣able time to call them to an Account for it. That if any thing had been to be done of that kind, there should have been a fitter choice of the Persons, there being many of the House, of more mischievous inclina∣tions, and designs against the King's person, and the Government, and were more exposed to the Publick Prejudice, than the Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> was; who was a Civil, and well natured man, and had rather kept ill Company, than drank deep of that infection and poison, that had wrought upon many others. Then S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur Haslerigg,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Strode,</HI> were persons of too Low an account and esteem; and tho' their Viru∣lence, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and Malice was as conspicuous, and transcendent as any man's, yet their reputation, and interest to do mischief otherwise than in con∣curring in it, was so small, that they gained credit and authority, by be∣ing joined with the rest, who had indeed a great Influence. However, since there was a resolution to proceed against Those men, it would have been much better to have caused them to have been all Severally ar∣rested, and sent to the Tower, or to other Prisons, which might have been very easily done before suspected, than to send in that manner to the Houses with that Formality, which would be liable to so many exceptions. At least, they ought so far to have imparted it to Members <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> in both Houses, who might have been trusted, that in the Instant of the Accusation, when both Houses were in that Consternation (as in a great consternation they were) somewhat might have been pressed Confident∣ly towards the King's satisfaction; which would have produced some op∣position and contradiction, and might have prevented that Universal concurrence and dejection of Spirit, which seized upon, and possessed both Houses.</P>
<P>BUT above all, the anger, and indignation was very great and general, that to all the other oversights and presumptions was added the exposing the Dignity, and Majesty, and Safety of the King, in his coming in Per∣son, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in that manner, to the House of Commons; and in going the next day, as he did to the <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> and to the Lord Mayors; which drew such Reproaches upon him to his Face. All which was justly impur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
<PB N="297" REF="3170"/>
to the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who had before fewer true Friends than he deserved, and had now allmost the whole Nation his Enemys, being the most Uni∣versally odious of any man in it.</P>
<P>WHEN the House of Commons had Passed such Votes from the Com∣mittee at <HI>Merchant-Taylors-Hall,</HI> as they thought necessary, and had once more Adjourned thither, the Committee asked the advice of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House, whether the accused Members might be present with them (who had intruth directed, and governed all their proceedings from the time they Sate there) which was not only approved, but those Members re∣quired <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to attend the House the next day it was to sit, and so to continue the service of the House, which was then Adjourned for three or four days, that the City might appear in such a posture, as should be thought convenient.</P>
<P>THE noise was so great of the preparations made in the City to bring the accused Members in Triumph to the Parliament, and that the whole Militia would accompany them, whilst the Seamen and Mariners made an appearance in Barges, and other Vessels upon the <HI>Thames</HI> to <HI>West∣minster,</HI> that the King thought it convenient to remove again from <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and so on the tenth of <HI>January,</HI> which was the Eve to that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> great Festival, his Majesty, the Queen, and the Royal Children, went from <HI>White-Hall</HI> to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> waited on by some few of their own Houshold Servants, and thirty or forty of those Officers, who had attended at <HI>White-Hall</HI> for security against the tumults.</P>
<P>BEFORE His going, he sent to the Earls of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> to at∣tend him in this journey; who were both by their Places, the one being Lord Chamberlain of his Houshold, the other the first Gentleman of his Bed-Chamber or Groom of the Stole, Obliged to that Duty. The Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> resolved to go, and, to that purpose, was making himself ready, when the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> came to him, and privately disswaded <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> him; assuring him, that if They two went, they should be both Mur∣ther'd at <HI>Hampton-Court;</HI> whereupon they left the King to his small retinue in a most disconsolate, perplexed condition, in more need of com∣fort and Counsel, than they had ever known him; and instead of attend∣ing their Master in that exigent, they went together into the City, where the Committee Sate, and where they were not the less welcome for be∣ing known to have been invited to have waited upon their Majesties. They who wished the King best, were not sorry that he Then with∣drew from <HI>White▪Hall;</HI> for the insolence, with which all that people were transported, and the animosity, which was infused into the hearts <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of the people in general against the Court, and even against the Person of the King, cannot be expressed.</P>
<P>WHILST the Committee Sate in <HI>London,</HI> the Common Council like∣wise met, as hath been said, to the end they might be ready to comply in any particulars should be desired from the City; and so the Com∣mittee having Resolved, <Q>“”that the actions of the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> or of any other person whatsoever for the defence of the Parliament, or the Priviledges thereof, or the preservation of the Members thereof, were according to their duty, and to their late Protestation, and the Laws of this Kingdom:</Q> and if any person should arrest, or trouble <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> any of them for so doing, he was declared <Q>“”to be a publick Enemy of the Common-wealth: and in the next place having Resolved, "that that Vote should be made known to the Common Council of the City of <HI>London,</HI></Q> the accused Members about two of the Clock in the Afternoon

<P>FROM <HI>London</HI> bridge to <HI>Westminster,</HI> the <HI>Thames</HI> was guarded with above a hunder'd Lighters and Longboats, laden with small pieces of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Ordinance, and dressed up with Wast-cloaths and Streamers, as ready for Fight. And that the Train▪d-bands of <HI>London</HI> might be under the command of a person fit to lead them, they granted a Commission to Captain <HI>Skippon,</HI> who was Captain of the Artillery Garden, to be Major-General of the Militia of the City of <HI>London;</HI> an Office never before heard of, nor imagined that they had authority to constitute. The man had served very long in <HI>Holland,</HI> and from a common Soldier had raised himself to the degree of a Captain, and to the reputation of a good Offi∣cer; he was a man of order and sobriety, and untainted with any of those vices, which the Officers of that Army were exercised in; and had newly <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> given over that service upon some exceptions he had to it, and, coming to <HI>London,</HI> was by some Friends preferred to that Command in the Ar∣tillery Garden, which was to teach the Citizens the exercise of their Arms. He was alltogether illiterate, and having been bred allways abroad, brought disaffection enough with him from thence against the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and so was much caressed and trusted by that Party.</P>
<P>THIS man marched that day in the head of their tumultuary Army to the Parliament House; where the accused Members were no sooner enter▪d, than they magnified <Q>“”the great kindness and affection they had found in the City, and their zeal to the Parliament; and if their ex∣pressions <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of it, upon this extraordinary occasion, had been somewhat unusual, that the House was ingaged in honour to Protect and defend them from receiving any damage.</Q> Whereupon the Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> were called into the House of Commons, and thanked by the Speaker for their extraordinary care, and love expressed to the Parliament; and told, <Q>“”that they should have an Ordinance of Parliament for their In∣demnity, declaring that all their actions of respect and kindness, which they had shew'd to the Lords and Commons in <HI>London,</HI> and their at∣tending them to,</Q> and at <HI>Westminster,</HI> was legal and justifiable. The Masters and Officers of Ships were likewise called in, and most heartily <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> thanked for their kindness; and Serjeant Major-General <HI>Skippon</HI> ap∣pointed every day to attend at <HI>Westminster,</HI> with such a Guard as he thought sufficient for the two Houses. There was one circumstance not to be forgotten in the march of the Citizens that day, when the shew by Water was little inferior to the other by Land, that the Pikemen had fasten▪d to the tops of their pikes, and the rest in their hats or their bo∣soms, printed Papers of the Protestation which had been taken, and enjoined by the House of Commons the year before for the defence of the Priviledge of Parliament; and many of them had the printed Votes of the King's breaking their Priviledges in his coming to the House, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> demanding their Members.</P>

So they provided and declared, <Q>“”that no Member of Parliament should be arrested upon any pretence what∣soever.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> And because it had been insisted on that they would not make any Declaration so much against the known Law, which allowed no Pri∣viledge in the case of Treason, Felony, or breach of the Peace, they now added that <Q>“”even in the case of Treason, no Member ought or could be arrested, or proceeded against, without first informing the House, of which he was a Member, of the Charge and Evidence against him, and receiving Their leave and direction for the proceeding against him.</Q> And that men might hereafter be more wary how they were made instrumental in bringing any reproach upon them, they Appointed a Committee to prepare a Charge against <HI>Herbert</HI> the King's Atturney <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> General for presuming to accuse the Members of High-Treason; which was made ready accordingly, and prosecuted with wonderful vigour, as will be remembred hereafter.</P>
<P>THEY resolved that the King should not enjoy much ease and quiet in his retreat; and therefore every day sent some Committee or other to him with Petitions and expostulations: a Committee of Lords and Commons attended him with a grievous complaint of the Breach of Pri∣viledge, they had sustained by his coming to the House; and desired him <Q>“”that he would inform them who had given him that pernicious Coun∣sel, that such evil Counsellors might be brought to justice, and receive <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign punishment.</Q> And when they found that the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> whom they generally believed to be the Author and contriver of all that transaction, tho▪ they could have no evidence of it, had withdrawn

<P>AND in one day both Houses agreed in, and executed three Acts of Soveraignty, even of as high nature as any they have since ventured upon; the first, <Q>“”in commanding the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> by, and with the advice of their new Serjeant-Major-General <HI>Skippon,</HI> to place a <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Guard upon, that is to Besiege the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> to hinder the go∣ing in of any provisions, or going out of any Arms or Ammunition;</Q> the second, "in appointing S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> to go to <HI>Hull,</HI> which will be mentioned anon; the third <Q>“”in sending an Order to the Governour of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> that no body should be admitted into that town and fort, or suffer'd to pass from thence, or any thing to be disposed of there, but by order from the King signified by both Houses of Par∣liament.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER this, a message was resolved upon to be sent to the Governour of the Prince, <Q>“”that he should not suffer the Prince to be transported out <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of the Kingdom, as he would answer the breach of Trust reposed in him concerning Religion, and the honour, safety, and peace of the three Kingdoms; and they declared, "that any person, who should perswade or attend upon him in such transportation, should be under the same

Censure.</Q> With these high Acts of publick concernment they joined the vindication of themselves from the late Trespass: and to that end<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> the Atturn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Gen. t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing the Impeachment of the five Members.</NOTE> caused the Atturney General to be publickly examined upon Interroga∣tories, <Q>“”whether he did contrive, frame, or advise the Articles of Im∣peachment against the Members that were accused? whether he knew the truth of them upon his Own knowledge, or by information? whe∣ther he would undertake to make them good, when he should be there∣unto called▪ from whom he received them, and by whose direction or advice he did exhibite them? whether he had any testimony or proof of them before the exhibiting? And having received his Answer, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">His <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> that he had neither framed, nor advised them, nor knew any thing of the truth of them, nor could undertake to justify them, but that he had received them from the King, and was by him commanded to ex∣hibite<NOTE PLACE="marg">They Vote a Charge against him.</NOTE> them; they presently declared, "that he had broken the Privi∣ledge of Parliament in preferring those Articles, and that the same was Illegal, and he Criminal for so doing; and that a Charge should be sent to the Lords, in the name of the House of Commons, against the Atturney General, to have satisfaction for the great scandal, and injury to the Members thereof, unless he did within five days bring in his Proof, and make good the Articles against them. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></Q></P>
<P>So that they had now raised to themselves an unquestionable stock of security, when they had declared, <Q>“”that they might neither be ap∣prehended by a Warrant under the King's own hand, nor accused by his Atturney General,</Q> except Themselves were willing: and they, who had concluded it most exactly just, that the House of Peers must Im∣prison their own Members, as fast as the Commons accused them of High-Treason, and, by that rule, had, within less than a week before, freed themselves of twelve Bishops, who allways opposed their designs (and in a case, where every man's Conscience absolved them of the Guilt, of which they were charged) thought it now Unanswerable reason to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> condemn the Justice of the King's proceedings; <Q>“”because if a man should be committed and imprisoned assoon as the King accused him of High-Treason, the Parliament might by consequence be Dissolved; since he might successively accuse the whole body;</Q> which Logick, if they had not pleased to Vote the contrary, would have run as well in their own case, upon their own licence of accusing, and more dangerously in respect of the House of Peers, which might possibly indeed have been thereby Dissolved.</P>
<P>THO' the King had removed himself out of the noise of <HI>Westminster,</HI> yet the effects of it followed him very close; for besides the <HI>Buckingham∣shire</HI> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Petitioners, who alarm'd him the same, or the next day after he came to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> several of the same nature were every day pre∣sented to him, in the name of other Countys of the Kingdom; all which were printed, and scattered abroad with the Declaration of the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>'s Levying War at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> and the Proclamation for apprehending him; all which being so industriously dispersed, and without any colour, or ground of danger, but only that the Kingdom might be inured to the style of the two Houses, and exercised in their commands against the time that they meant to be in earnest, gave the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> King reason to remove in few days from <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> to his Castle at <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Windsor,</HI> where he could be more secure from any suddain popular At∣tempt; of which he had reason to be very apprehensive, when after those high Acts of Sedition at <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI> were declared
<PB N="303" REF="3230"/>
to be according to the Laws of the Land, and the Protestation lately taken, that Protestation was by a new Order enjoined to be administer'd throughout the Kingdom, and the Names of all those who refused to take it, which there was reason to believe many would upon Their new Glosses, return'd to the House of Commons, who were as severe Inqui∣sitors as could be found any where.</P>
<P>FROM thence his Majesty sent a Message to both Houses, <Q>“”that he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thence finds a Message to both Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> took notice, that his proceedings against those Persons, whom he had accused (naming them) were conceived by many to be Illegal, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> not agreeable to the Priviledge of Parliament, and that he was so de∣sirous to give satisfaction to all men in all matters, that might seem to have relation to Priviledge of Parliament, that he would wave his former proceedings; and all doubts being by that means setled, when the minds of men were composed, he would proceed against them in an unquestionable way; and he assured both Houses, that, upon all occasions, he would be as careful of their Priviledges as of his Life, or his Crown. To which he added, that, in all his proceedings against those Persons, he had never the least intention of violating the least Priviledge of Parliament; and in case any doubt of breach of Privi∣ledge <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> remain'd, he would be willing to assert it by any reasonable way his Parliament should advise him to; and therefore he desired them forthwith to lay by all jealousies, and apply themselves to the publick and pressing Assairs, and especially to those of <HI>Ireland,</HI> wherein the good of the Kingdom, and the true Religion, which should ever be his first care, were so highly and so nearly concern'd. And he desired them, that his care of Their Priviledges might increase their care of His Lawful Prerogative, which was so necessary to the mutual defence of each other, and both would be the foundation of a perpetual and perfect intelligence between his Majesty and Parliaments, and of the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> happiness and prosperity of his People.</Q></P>
<P>BUT this Message was not such as they looked for; there seem'd still to be left a time for prosecution, and tho the errour in Form seem'd to be consented to, yet the Substance and Matter of the accusation might be still insisted on. And therefore they took no notice of it, but pro∣ceeded in inflaming all men with the sense of the breach of Priviledge; and finding the general mettal somewhat to abate, that they might keep up the apprehension ofdanger, and the esteem of their Darling the City, they consult about Adjourning both Houses into <HI>London;</HI> but finding some danger of infringing the Act of Parliament, from whence some <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> advantage might be taken to their prejudice, till that power might be cleared by a Law, they were contented to Adjourn their Houses as they had done for some days, and to appoint Committees, qualified with more power than the Houses had, to meet in <HI>London;</HI> which for the conve∣nience of the Common Council, who took up the <HI>Guild▪Hall,</HI> chose to sit in <HI>Grocers-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>IT was wonder'd, that having All places so much at their devotion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Houses appoint Com∣mittees to sit in <HI>Grocers-Hall.</HI></NOTE> they would remove from their more convenient seats at <HI>Westminster;</HI> where they might transact whatsoever they desired without interruption, and where they were only disturbed by their own direction. But the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> advantage they reaped by it was extraordinary; for, besides the fears they dispersed abroad, and the confidence they gave their own Friends of the City by being with them, they were sure, for the most part, to have a Committee to their own hearts desire; since, besides many out

of Laziness or Indignation would not attend the Service in so inconve∣nient a place, very many, who troubled them most in their Counsels, Durst not in earnest go thither, for fear of uncomely Affronts, if not danger, their names being published in the tumults as Disaffected per∣sons; and They were those indeed, which constituted the Malignant party, which they prayed against: and they found it much easier to transact any thing contrived and framed by such a Committee, than ori∣ginally offer▪d and debated in either House, before the mystery was un∣derstood by their Proselytes, and when those, who too well understood it, did render their designs sometimes ineffectual. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THE minds of men throughout the Kingdom being now prepared to receive all their Dictates with reverence, and to obey all their Orders, and to believe that all their safety consisted in, and depended upon their Authority, and there being few within the House, who had courage to oppose and contradict them, they sent to the Lords to quicken them in the Bill, they had formerly sent to them concerning removing the Bishops out of their House; which now, when there were so many of them Prisoners in the Tower, they presumed would not meet with so<NOTE PLACE="marg">The C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmons go upon S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>John▪<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Bill of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</NOTE> great an opposition. In the House of Commons they called to have the Bill read, which had layn so long there, the same that had been brought <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in by S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Johns</HI> for the setling the Militia of the Kingdom; to which they Now added <Q>“”the putting all the Forts, Castles, and Garrisons into the hands of such persons as they could <HI>Confide</HI> in;</Q> which was the Ex∣pression they used, when they had a mind to remove any man from a place, of which he was justly possessed, <Q>“”that they could not <HI>Confide</HI> in him,</Q> which they thought to be reason enough to displace any man. When this Bill had been with much ado accepted, and first read, there were few men, who imagined it would ever receive further counte∣nance: but now there were few, who did not believe it to be a very necessary provision for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom. So <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> great an impression had the late proceedings made upon them; so that with little opposition it passed the Commons, and was sent up to the Lords.</P>
<P>UPON the disbanding the late Army in the North, all the Artillery, Arms, and Ammunition, that was provided for that service, had been by the King's command sent to <HI>Hull,</HI> where it still remained; and his Majesty intended it should be kept there, for a Magazine upon all oc∣casions. And he had a little before these late passages sent the Earl of <HI>New-Castle</HI> thither, with a private Commission to be Governour thereof, assoon as it should be fit to publish such a Command; and in the mean <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> time by his own Interest to draw in such of the Country, as were neces∣sary to Guard the Magazine. But nothing the King did in the most private manner, but was quickly known to those, from whom it should most have been concealed. And so the Earl of <HI>New-Castle</HI> was no sooner gone, but notice was taken of it; and he had not been three days in <HI>Hull,</HI> before the House of Peers sent for him, to attend the Service of that House, which he had rarely used to do, being for the most part at <HI>Richmond</HI> attending upon the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> whose Governour he was. He made no hast to return upon the Summons of the House, but sent to the King to know His pleasure; who not thinking mat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers yet <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> ripe enough to make any Such declaration, appointed him to come away; upon which he appeared in the House, without being asked where he had been.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="3250"/>
BUT both Houses shortly after moved the King, <Q>“”that the Magazine<NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Houses move the King that the Ma∣gazine at Hull might be re∣moved to the Tower.</NOTE> at <HI>Hull</HI> might be removed to the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> which would be very necessary for the quieting the minds of that Country, and abating the fears and jealousies in the hearts of very many, who did apprehend some design in the keeping so much Ammunition in the Northern parts:</Q> and his Majesty not giving them a speedy Answer, they sent down S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> whose Estate lay within three or four miles of<NOTE PLACE="marg">T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey send <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth the H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thams to Hull.</NOTE> <HI>Hull,</HI> and he had some command of the Train'd-bands, <Q>“”to be Governour thereof, and to draw in such of the Country as He thought fit for the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> place.</Q> And tho' <HI>Hotham,</HI> had concurred with them in all their vio∣lent ways, yet they well knew that he was not possessed with their Principles in any degree, but was very well affected in his judgment to the Government both in Church and State, but had been first ingaged by his particular malice against the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and afterwards ter∣rified by their Votes against Sheriffs and Deputy Licutenants; and there∣fore they sent his Son, a Member likewise of the House, and in whom they more Confided, to assist him in that Service, or rather to be a Spy upon his Father. And this was the first Essay they made of their So∣vereign power over the Militia and the Forts, whilst their Bill was yet <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> depending, and was a sufficient manifestation what they intended to do, when it should be passed; towards which they made all the hast they could, exercising the King's patience every day with some disagreeable Message to him, upon their Priviledges, and requiring <Q>”“vindication, and reparation, and discovery of the persons who had promoted that Prosecution.</Q> And tho' the Council once a week attended upon his Majesty at <HI>Windsor,</HI> he could not freely consult with them upon what most concerned him.</P>
<P>IN this sad condition was the King at <HI>Windsor,</HI> fallen in ten days from a Height and Greatness that his Enemys feared, to such a Lowness, that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> his own Servants durst hardly avow the waiting on him. For tho', `tis true, the acts of the House of Commons, and the Tumults, were as great affronts to Majesty, before this last Act upon the Members, as any that could be imagined possible to succeed, yet the House of Peers was Then well disposed, and might have been managed with a little patience, to have blasted all the extravagances of the Commons. And the truth is, the greatest extravagances appeared to the standers by to be but the at∣tempts of persons in Despair, and the struglings of men at the last Gasp. And, without doubt, if the King could have had the patience to have sate <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> still a Spectator of the Dissentions between the two Houses, and in∣couraging the Lords, who were firm to him, and putting those matters in issue, wherein the Commons had invaded both His and the Lords Priviledges; if he had commanded his Council at Law and the Judges, to have proceeded by the strict rules of the Law against Seditious per∣sons at large, for Preaching and Printing against the peace of the King∣dom, and put the Commons House either to have been quiet, whilst their Champions were exemplary punished (which would have put a speedy end to their Licence) or to have appeared the Champions for an Infamous Act against the Law and the Justice of the Kingdom, their Jurisdiction would probably in a short time have been brought within <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the Due limits, and the stoutest Factor for the violent Party been glad to have compounded for an Act of Oblivion.</P>
<P>AND I have heard from Credible persons, that the Chief of that Faction afterwards confessed, that if that extraordinary Accident had
<PB N="306" REF="3260"/>
not happened to give them New credit and reputation, they were sink∣ing under the weight of the Expectation of those, whom they had de∣luded, and the Envy of those, whom they had oppressed. I am sure, they who out of Conscience, and Loyalty to their King and Country, di∣ligently attended the publick Service, were strangely surprized at the matter and manner of that accusation; and foresaw, from the minute, the infinite disadvantage it would bring to the King's affairs. Not that they thought the Gentlemen accused, less Guilty; for their extream dishonest acts in the House were so visible, that nothing could have been laid to their charge incredible: but the going through with it was a mat∣ter <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of so great difficulty and concernment, that every Circumstance ought to have been fully deliberated, and the several parts distributed into Such hands, as would not have Shaken in the execution. And the saying, that the King had not competent persons enough, whom he might trust in so important a Secret (which I believe was true) is rather an Argument, that the thing was not to be attempted at all, than that it was to be attempted in That manner; for whoever would have betray∣ed the trust, would be sure to find fault with it, when it was endeavoured without him, especially if it miscarried. The truth is, there was lit∣tle reason to believe, that the House of Peers would commit the Lord <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Kimbolton</HI> upon the Accusation of M<SUP>r</SUP> Atturney in that conjuncture of time; and less that the House of Commons would deliver up their Mem∣bers to the Serjeant at Arms, when they should be demanded; which was an Irregular thing, and implied unreasonably, that They had some Power to Keep them, Who were Desired to deliver them Yet if the choice had been better made, and the several persons first Apprehended, and put into distinct close Custodies, that neither any body else should have heard from them, nor they one from another, all which had not been very difficult, the high Spirit of both Houses might possibly have been so dejected, that they might have been Treated withall. But even <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that attempt had been too great for the Solitary State the King was in at that time; which was most naturally to have been improved by stand∣ing upon his guard, and denying all that was in his Power to deny, and in compelling his Ministers to execute the Law in Those Cases, that De∣monstrably concerned the publick Peace.</P>

<P>THE King continued at <HI>Windsor</HI> to expect the end, or the issue of this tempest; and finding that they hardly would take notice of his former Messages, but proceeded in the High-ways of Destruction, for he had ad∣vertisement of their most secret combinations, resolved to send such a Message to the two Houses, whose United reputation was yet too great to struggle with, as might at least divide Those, who desired the publick Peace, from the Ministers of Confusion: and so on the 20<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>January</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings proposit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on and Message to both Houses <HI>Jan 20.</HI></NOTE> sent this proposition and Message to them in writing, <Q>“”For preventing those evils, which the manifold Distractions threaten'd to the King∣dom; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that They would with all speed fall into a serious consideration of all those particulars, which they held necessary, as well for the up∣holding and maintaining the King's just and Regal Authority, and the setling his Revenue, as for the present and future establishment of Their Priviledges, the free and quiet enjoying of their Estates, and for∣tunes, the liberties of their persons, the security of the true Religion now professed in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the setling of Ceremonies in such a manner, as might take away all Just offence; which when they should have digested, and composed into one entire body, that so his Majesty and themselves might be able to make the more clear <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> judgment of them, it should then appear, by what his Majesty would do, how far he had been from intending, or designing any of those things, which the too great Fears and Jealousies of some persons seemed to apprehend; and how ready he would be to equal, and exceed the greatest examples of the most Indulgent Princes in their Acts of grace and favour to their People; so that if all the present Distractions, which so apparently threaten'd the ruine of the Kingdom, did not, by the Blessing of Allmighty God, end in a happy and blessed accommo∣dation, his Majesty would Then be ready to call Heaven and Earth, God and Man, to witness,</Q> that it had not failed on His part.</P>

<P>THIS gave them New offence and trouble; and if the King's Coun∣cil had had the courage to have insisted upon the matter of Law, and the Lords would have given them reasonable countenance, they would have been much puzled to have procured a Resolution, that would have served their purposes to all parts, and been content to have suspended Their judgment, that so the King might have suspended His prosecu∣tion. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> For if the Judges had been called to deliver their opinions in point of Law, which they ought to have been, they could not have avoided the declaring, that by the known Law, which had been con∣fessed in all times and ages, no Priviledge of Parliament could extend in the case of Treason; but that every Parliament man was Then in the condition of every other Subject, and to be proceeded against accord∣ingly. In the next place, as they would never have ventured themselves upon the House of Peers under an Impeachment, and thereby made Them their judges, which indeed was incongruous, every Subject being to be tryed for his Life <HI>per Pares, vel per Legem terrae,</HI> to both which <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Lords, and the Impeachment, were directly opposite; so they would less have trusted an Indictment at Law, and a well chosen sober Jury, who had been bound to follow their evidence of Fact, and were not Judges of the Law, which was severe in any Conspiracy against the Crown, or the Persons of King or Queen.</P>
<P>BuT having shut the doors against any mention of Law, they made no scruple of resolving, and answering his Majesty, <Q>“”that they were first to see the evidence he had to prove the guilt, before they could give any direction for the manner of the Prosecution,</Q> and proceeding; which they grounded upon a Maxime, they had but lately established, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> tho' never till then heard of; <Q>“”that no Member of Parliament, for what Offence soever, could be Arrested, or proceeded against but by the con∣sent of that House, of which he was a Member; and then, they said, they could not give, or deny their consent by any other measure than the Knowledge of the Crime and Proof, upon which such Member stood accused.</Q> Which Conclusion had been reasonable had the Premises been just; whereas the argument was to be inverted, that Their consent was not to be asked, because they had no Cognisance of the Crime, of which their Members were accused, nor were Judges whether their accusation were valid in Law, or sufficiently proved in Fact. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>

<PB N="311" REF="3310"/>
confounded, and so their Wills perverted, by the mere men∣tion of Priviledge of Parliament; which, instead of the plain, and in∣telligible notion of it, was by the dexterity of those Boutefeus, and their under-Agents of the Law, and the Supine Sottishness of the People, render'd such a mystery, as could be only explained by Themselves, and extended as far as they found necessary for their occasions, and was to be acknowledged a good reason for any thing, that no Other reason could be given for. <Q>“”We are, say they, and have been allways confessed, the only Judges of our own Priviledges; and therefore whatsoever we de∣clare <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to be our Priviledge, is such: otherwise whosoever determines that it is Not so, makes himself Judge of that, whereof the Cognisance only belongs to Us.</Q> And this Sophistical Riddle perplexed many, who, notwithstanding the desperate Consequence they saw must result from such Logick, taking the first Proposition for true, which, being rightly understood, is so, have not been able to wind themselves out of the Labyrinth of the Conclusion: I say the Proposition Rightly under∣stood: They are the only Judges of their own Priviledges, that is, upon the Breach of those Priviledges, which the Law hath declared to be their own, and what punishment is to be inflicted upon such Breach. But <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> there can be no Priviledge, of which the Law doth not take notice, and which is not pleadable by, and at Law.</P>
<P>THE truth and clearness of this will best appear by Instance▪ If I am Arrested by Process out of any Court, I am to plead in the Court, that I am a Member of Parliament, and that, by the Priviledge of Parlia∣ment, my Person ought to be free from Arrests. Upon this Plea the Judge is bound to discharge me; and if he does not, he is a Criminal, as for any other trespass against the Law: but the punishing the Person, who hath made this infringement, is not within His power, but proper to that Jurisdiction, against which the contempt is; therefore that House, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of which I am a Member, upon complaint made of such an Arrest, usually sends for the persons culpable, the party at whose Suit the Arrest is made, and the Officers which executed it, and commits them to Prison, till they make acknowledgement of their Offence. But that House ne∣ver sends, at least never did till this Parliament, any Order to the Court out of which the Process issued, to stay the proceedings at Law, because the Priviledge ought to be legally pleaded. So, after the Dissolution of Parliament, if I am Arrested within the days of Priviledge, upon any plea of Priviledge the Court discharges me; but then the Party that Ar∣rests me, escapes punishment till the next Parliament, the Judge having <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> no more power to commit the man that sued or arrested me, than he hath to imprison a man for bringing an Action at Law, when he hath no good title; neither is He Judge of the contempt.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if a man brings an Information, or an Action of the Case, for words spoken by me, and I plead that the words were spoken by me in Parliament, when I was a Member there, and that it is against the Priviledge of Parliament, that I should be impleaded in any other place, for the words I spoke There; I ought to be discharged from this Action or Information, because this Priviledge is known, and pleadable at Law; but That Judge can neither punish, nor examine the breach <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of Priviledge, nor Censure the contempt. And this is the true and pro∣per meaning of the old received Axiom, that they are Judges Only of their own Priviledges.</P>
<P>AND indeed these two, of freedom from Arrests for their Persons
<PB N="312" REF="3320"/>
(which originally hath not been of that latitude to make a Parliament a Sanctuary for Bankrupts, where any person out-lawed hath been de∣clared incapable of being returned thither a Member) and of liberty of Speech, were accounted their chiefest Priviledges of Parliament: For their other, of Access to the King, and correspondence by Conference with the Lords, are rather of the Essence of their Councils, than Privi∣viledges belonging to them. But that their being Judges of their Pri∣viledges should qualify them to make New Priviledges, or that their Judgment should Create them such, as it was a doctrine never before Now heard of, so it could not but produce all those Monstrous effects <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> we have seen; when they have assumed to swallow all the Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, the Liberties and Lands of the Church, the Power and Jurisdiction of the Peers, in a word, the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of <HI>England,</HI> in the bottomless and insatiable Gulph of their own Priviledges.

But they, notwithstanding, no way discouraged, but confiding in his Majesty's goodness to his people, did therefore make their humble Address to him to beseech him, that the

Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and other principal Forts, and the whole Militia of the Kingdom, might be put into the hands of such persons as should be recommended to him by the House of Commons; not doubting but they should receive a Gracious, and speedy Answer to that their hum∣ble Desire, without which, in all Humane reason, the great Distractions of the Kingdom must needs overwhelm it with misery and Ruine.</Q></P>
<P>THE King was not troubled at the receipt of this Petition, glad, that since they could not be brought to such a degree of Reasonableness, as might make up all breaches, they would be so peremptorily Unreason∣able <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> as might probably sever Those from them, who were not so Despe∣rate as themselves; and he hoped, that when the people should observe that this grasping of the Militia of the Kingdom into their own hands, as an Expedient for the composing their high grown Fears and Jealou∣sies, was no more than they desired the Summer before, when S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur Haslerigg</HI> brought in his Bill into the House of Commons, which is be∣fore remembred, when that title of Fears and Jealousies was not disco∣vered; and when the Pee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s should observe, that the House of Commons insolently Demanded, by their own Single Suffrage, the deputing men to Places of that vast Importance, they would both conclude, that those <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> immodest Askers were not only fit to be Denied, but Reformed: yet be∣lieving that Real and Just fears might grow up, to discountenance and suppress those Imaginary ones, his Majesty vouchsafed a very soft and gentle Answer to that Petition; and told them, <Q>“”that he hoped his<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majestys Answer.</NOTE> gracious Message would have produced some such Overture, as by of∣fering what was fit on Their parts to do, and by asking what was pro∣per for Him to grant, might have begot a mutual Confidence in each other. Concerning the Tower of <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don,</HI> that he did not expect, having preferred a person of a known Fortune, and unquestionable Re∣putation, to that Trust, that he should have been pressed to remove <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> him without any particular Charge objected against him; however, that if, upon due examination, any particular should be presented to him, whereby it might appear he was mistaken in his good opinion of that Gentleman, and that he was unfit for the Trust committed to him, he would make no scruple of discharging him; otherwise, he was obliged in justice to himself, to preserve his Own work, lest his Favour and good Opinion might prove a Disadvantage and Misfortune to his Servants, without any other Accusation; of which he hoped his House of Commons would be so tender, as of a business, wherein his Honour was much concerned, as if they found no material Ex∣ceptions <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> against that person, they would rather endeavour to satisfy and Reform the Fears of other men, than, by complying with them, press his Majesty to any thing, which did so much reflect upon his Ho∣nour, and Justice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Forts and Castles of the Kingdom, that he was resolved they should allways be in such hands, and Only in such, as the Parlia∣ment might safely Confide in; but the Nomination of any persons to those Places, being so principal and inseparable a flower of his Crown, vested in him, and derived to him from his Ancestors by the funda∣mental Laws of the Kingdom, he would reserve to Himself; in be∣stowing <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> whereof, as he would take care that no corrupt or Sinister courses should prevail with him, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o he was willing to declare, that he should not be induced to express that Favour so soon to any persons, as to Those, whose good Demeanour should be Eminent in, or to his Par∣liament.

And if he then had, or should at any time, by misinforma∣tion confer such a Trust upon an Undeserving person, he was, and would allways be, ready to leave him to the wisdom and Justice of the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Militia of the Kingdom, which by the Law was subject to no command but of his Majesty, and of authority lawfully derived from him, he said, when any particular course for ordering the same should be considered, and digested, and proposed to him, he would re∣turn such an Answer as should be agreeable to his Honour, and the safety of his People, he being resolved only to deny those things, the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Granting whereof would alter the fundamental Laws and endanger the very foundation, upon which the Publick happiness and wel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are of his people was founded and constituted, and which would nourish a greater, and more destructive Jealou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y between the Crown, and the Subject, than any of those, which would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eem to be taken away by such a satisfaction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, he was willing to doubt, that His having granted more than ever King granted, would perswade Them to ask more than ever Subjects had asked: but if they should acquaint him with the particular grounds of their doubts and their Fears, he would very <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> willingly apply Remedies proportionable to those fears; for he called God to witness, that the preservation of the publick Peace, the Law, and the liberty of the Subject, was, and should allways be, as much his care,</Q> as his own life▪ or the lives of his dearest Children.</P>
<P><Q>“”AND therefore he did conjure them by all the acts of Favour they had received from him this Parliament, by their hopes of future hap∣piness in his Majesty, and in one another, by their love of Religion, and the Peace of the Kingdom, in which, he said, that of <HI>Ireland</HI> was included, that they would not be transported by Jealousies, and appre∣hensions of Possible dangers, to put themselves, or his Majesty, into <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Real and Present inconveniences; but that they would speedily pur∣sue the way proposed by his former Mes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age▪ which, in Humane rea∣son, was the only way to compose the Distractions of the Kingdom, and, with God's blessing, would restore a great measure of felicity to King and People</Q></P>
<P>THIS Answer being not only a denial, but such an expostulation as would render their Counsels of less reverence to the people, if upon those reasons they should recede from what they had with that confidence, and disdain of the House of Peers demanded of the King; they there∣fore resolved to set up their rest upon that stake, and to go through with <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> it, or perish in the attempt.

<P>THEY had wholely undertaken the managing of the War in <HI>Ireland,</HI>
<PB N="315" REF="3350"/>
and really, for many reasons, neither did use, nor desired to use, any great expedition in that work; yet having with great industry infused into the minds of the people at least a Suspicion that the Court favoured that Rebellion, they allways made use of the slowness in those proceed∣ings to the King's disadvantage. About that time, they had desired the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Commons <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to bor∣row money of the City.</NOTE> City to furnish them with one hundred thousand pounds, for the levy∣ing, and accommodating forces to be sent into that Kingdom, which gave the Common Council, where such loans were allways transacted, opportunity to return their opinions, and advice upon the general State <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of Affairs.

<P><Q>“”THAT the not putting the Forts into such hands, in whom the Par∣liament might Confide, the not setling the Kingdom in a posture of defence, the not removing the present Lieutenant of the Tower, and putting such a person into that place, as might be well approved by the Parliament, could not but overthrow Trading more and more, and make moneys yet more scarce in the City and Kingdom. That the misunderstanding between the King and Parliament, the not vindi∣cating the Priviledges thereof, the charging some Members of Treason to the deterring of others from discharging their Duties, and to the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> destroying the very Being of Parliaments, did exceedingly fill the minds of men well affected to the publick, with many fears and discourage∣ments; and so disable them from yielding that chearful assistance, which they would be glad to afford. That, by this means, there was such a decay of Trading, and such scarcity of money, neither of which could be cured, till the former evils were removed, as it was like, in very short time, to cast innumerable multitudes of poor Artificers into such a depth of poverty and extremity, as might enforce them upon some dangerous and desperate attempts, not fit to be Expressed, much less to be Justified; which they left to the House speedily to consider, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> prevent. These evils, under which they did exceedingly labour and languish, they said, did spring from the imploying of ill affected per∣sons in places of Trust and honour in the State, and near to the person of the King; and that they were still continued by means of the Votes of Bishops, and Popish Lords, in the House of Peers. And so having faithfully represented, they said, the true reasons, which really en∣forced them to return that Answer, they craved leave to protest before God and the High Court of Parliament, that if any further miseries befell their dear Brethren in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or if any mischief should break in upon this Kingdom, to the indangering or disturbing the peace there∣of, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> it ought not to be imputed to Them; but only to such, who should endeavour to hinder the effectual and speedy cure of those evils before recited, which did so much disable and discourage them from doing that,</Q> which the House had desired of them.</P>

<P><Q>“”THERE was an obstruction, he said, in the relief of <HI>Ireland,</HI> but he must declare the Commons were all together innocent of any neglect therein; they had agreed to the Levies of men and money, and, from time to time, done all for the furtherance thereof, tho' in the midst of many distractions and diversions; but the want of Commissions for levying men, that was the Bill about Pressing, and diverse other im∣pediments, had been the causes of That obstruction. Nay, he said, he <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> did not only find impediments to themselves, but incouragement to the Rebels; for many of the chief Commanders now in the head of the Rebels, after both Houses had stopp'd the Ports against all Irish Pa∣pists, had been suffer'd to Pass, by his Majestys immediate Warrants, much to the discouragement of the Lords Justices and Council there, which were procured by some evil instruments too near his Royal per∣son,</Q> and, they believed, without his Knowledge and intention.</P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, there was an obstruction in providing for the defence of the Kingdom, that they might be inabled to resist a forreign Enemy, and to suppress all civil Insurrections: what endeavour they had used <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to remove them, but hitherto without that success and Concurrence which they expected, and where their Stop had been, and upon what grounds they might proclaim their own Innocency and faithfulness in That particular,</Q> they desired no other witnesses but their Lordships.</P>
<P><Q>“”HE told them, the evil Influences, which had caused that Distem∣per, were the evil Councils about the King, the great power, that a Factious and Interessed Party had in Parliament by the continuance of the Votes of the Bishops, and Popish Lords, in their Lordships House, and the taking in of others out of the House of Commons, and, other∣wise to increase their strength, the fomenting a Malignant Party <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> throughout the Kingdom, the Jealousies between the King, and his Parliament.</Q> And after many bitter and Seditious expressions of the Court, and of all those, who were not of His mind, he concluded, <Q>“”that he had nothing to propose to their Lordships by way of request or de∣sire from the House of Commons; he doubted not, but their Judg∣ments would tell them what was to be done; their Consciences, their Honours, their Interests, would call upon them for the doing of it. The Commons would be glad to have their help and Concurrence in saving the Kingdom; but if their Lordships should fail, it should not discourage Them in doing Their duty; and whether the Kingdom be <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> lost, or saved, they should be sorry, that the story of this present Par∣liament should tell posterity, that, in so great danger and extremity, the House of Commons should be inforced to save the Kingdom Alone, and that the House of Peers should have no part in the Honour of the preservation of it, they having so great an interest in the good success of those endeavours, in respect of their great Estates and high degrees of Nobility.</Q></P>
<P>ASSOON as this Conference was ended, the Speaker of the House of Commons was appointed to give M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> solemn thanks for his so well performing that service, and to require them to deliver his Speech in <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> writing into the House, that it might be printed; which was done ac∣cordingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Speech printed by Order.</NOTE> to the end that the people might understand, besides those re∣proaches upon the King, how negligent the House of Peers were of their welfare and security.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="3380"/>
THE same day and hour after that Conference, a great number of people, in the name of the Inhabitants of the County of <HI>Hartford,</HI> pre∣sented a Petition to the House of Peers; in which, amongst other parti∣culars, <Q>“”they complained of the delay of putting the Kingdom into a posture of War for their better defence, and the want of complyance by that Honourable House with the House of Commons, in entertaining those many good Motions, and Passing those necessary Bills presented to them from that House for the Common Good. And therefore they desired them, for the better removing of all the causes and springs of their Fears and troubles, that the evil Counsellors, and others hinder∣ing <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Publick Good, might be taken from his Majesty, and the voting of the Bishops, and Popish Lords, to be removed out of that Honoura∣ble House: And that the Petitioners, who would be ever ready to hazard their Lives and Estates for the defence of the King and Parlia∣ment, the Priviledges of the same, and in special those noble Lords and Gentlemen in both Houses, whose endeavours were for the Publick Good, might have liberty to Protest against all those, as Enemys to the Kingdom, who refused to joyn with those Honourable Lords and the House of Commons, for the putting the Kingdom into a way of Safety, under the Command of such persons, as the Parliament should <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> appoint.</Q> But neither this, nor any of the other Proceedings were re∣sented by the House of Peers, tho' their Priviledges were not only in∣vaded, but the very Freedom and liberty of Parliament absolutely taken away and destroyed thereby.</P>
<P>WHEN the House of Commons found that none of these extraordi∣nary ways would throughly Subdue the House of Lords, but that, tho' they had very sturdy Champions there, the Major part, albeit the Bishops, and all the Recusant Lords were driven from thence, still opposed them, whereby neither the Bill for the taking away the Bishops Votes, nor about Pressing, could pass, and that they peremptorily still refused to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> joyn in the business of the Militia; they sound a New way, as Un∣practiced and as unnatural as any of the former, whereby they would be sure to have an influence upon the House of Peers. It is an old Custom, and Priviledge of that House, that upon any solemn debate, whosoever is not satisfied with the conclusion and judgment of the House, may demand leave to enter his Protestation, which must be granted. The Original of this was in Jealous times, when men desired, for avoiding the ill consequence of any Act there, that their Dissents might appear; and was very seldom practiced, but when they conceived Religion, or the Crown, trenched upon; insomuch as you shall not find, in the Jour∣nals <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of many Parliaments, one Protestation enter'd; and when there was any, there was no more in the Records, than, after the Resolution of the House is enter'd, <Q>“”that such a Lord desired that his Protestation or dissent might be enter'd,</Q> and oftentimes when several have dissented from the general opinion, not above one or two have enter'd their Pro∣testation. But since this Parliament, as they alter'd this Custom from cases of high Concernment to the most trivial Debates, the Minor part ordinarily entering their Protestation, to the end that their opinions might be taken notice of, and who were opposite to them, whereby the Good and Bad Lords were known and published; so they altered the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> form, and instead of short general entries, caused the matter of Debate to be summed up, and thereupon their Protestation, <Q>“”that They were not to be answerable for any inconveniences or Mischiefs, that should
<PB N="319" REF="3390"/>
befall the Common-wealth by reason of this or that Resolution.</Q> So that from an Act for the particular Indemnity of the person, that made it, it grew sometimes to be a reproaching and arraigning the sense of the House by any Factious number that disagreed. Then because the House of Peers is a Court of Record, they concluded, <Q>“”that any man upon any occasion might peruse the Journals;</Q> and so every night the House of Commons could see how the Debates had been managed and carried all the day, and take publick notice, and make use of it accordingly, which they could not do of those discourses they received from their Confidents; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> for supplying whereof this Unjustifiable method was found out. For tho' it is a Court of Record, the highest Court, and the Acts and judg∣ments of Parliament are Records, to which the Subject may upon all occasions resort, yet they ought not to make use of that Liberty in or∣der to question any words spoken, or Acts done, and remember'd There; of which if the Lords are not the only Judges, their Priviledges are much less than the Commons intruth have, and may Justly claim.</P>
<P>IT happened, about this time, that upon some Overture in the Lords House, which pleased them not, the Violent Party there, in a disorderly manner, cried out, <HI>Adjourn, Adjourn,</HI> being not willing the matter <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> should Then come into debate; others were not willing that the House should Adjourn. The Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> troubled at that Tumultuary and indirect proceeding, said, without directing himself to the Speaker, "if they would Adjourn, he wished it might be for six Months, or words to that effect; upon which some of the other party immediately Moved, <Q>“”that the House might Not rise, and that the Duke would explain him∣self, and answer the making such a Motion, as, being granted, would be destructive to the Common wealth. The Duke said, "he made no Motion, but used that Expression, to shew his dislike of the other Motion to Adjourn at that time, when there was business in agitation <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of great Concernment; and that, when he spoke, all men being upon their feet,</Q> and out of their places, he conceived the House had been Up. Upon this he was required to withdraw; and then they, who had long looked upon him with great envy and animosity, as the only great per∣son, and Officer at Court, who had discountenanced their power, and their stratagems, and had with notable courage allways opposed their extravagances, and Servile complying with the House of Commons, and submitting to the Tumults, and had with singular Constancy pre∣served his duty and fidelity to his Majesty unviolated, inveighed against that Motion, <Q>“”as of too Serious a nature to be made a Jest of, and fit <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to be censured as most pernicious to This Kingdom, and destructive to <HI>Ireland:</HI> the War whereof could not proceed, if the Parliament should have been Adjourned for six Months, as his Lordship had pro∣posed.</Q></P>
<P>ON the other side, it was alledged, <Q>“”that the Motion had never been made to the House; and therefore they ought no more to question, or take notice of it, than of every light or frolick discourse or Expression, that negligently, or Casually fell from any man; which would take away all liberty of Conversation. However, that if it had been Se∣riously, and formally made, it could be no Crime, it being the ne∣cessary <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> liberty and Priviledge of every Member, to make any Motion he thought in His judgment fit, which the House would approve, or reject, as it found reasonable. And that, since it was as much in the Houses power to Adjourn for six Months, as for six Days, it was as
<PB N="320" REF="3400"/>
lawful to move the one, as the other; of which there could not be the least inconvenience, because the House would be sure to reject it, if it were not found proper.</Q> After a very fierce, and eager debate, in which much bitterness and Virulency was expressed, it was Resolved by the Major part, "that the Duke had committed no Offence; and so he was as regularly absolved as was possible. Hereupon the Earls of <HI>Northumberland, Pembroke, Essex,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> who thought the Dukes affection and duty to his Master a Repoach, and his interest pre∣judicial to Them, with the rest of that Party enter'd their Protestation; <Q>“”that whereas such a Motion had been made by the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and upon being questioned for the same, he had been acquitted by the Major part, They were free from the mischiefs or inconveniences, which might attend the not punishing of an Offence tending so much to the prejudice of King or Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Protestation, by the advice of that Nights meeting, was, the next day, taken notice of in the House of Commons, and the matter it self of the Motion inlarged upon, by all possible and Rhetorical aggra∣vations, concerning the Person, and his Interests, according to the li∣cence of that House, and that People. It was said, <Q>“”here was an evil Counsellor, that had discovered himself, and no doubt had been the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Author of many of those evil Counsels, which had brought that trou∣ble upon us; that he had received his education in <HI>Spain,</HI> and had been made a Grandee of that Kingdom, and had been ever since noto∣riously of that Faction; that his Sisters were Papists, and therefore his affection was to be questioned in Religion; that, from the beginning of this Parliament, he had been opposite to all their proceedings, and was an enemy to Reformation; that he had vehemently opposed the Attainder of the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> was a friend to Bishops; and now, to prevent any possibility of Reformation, which could not be effected without the Concurrence of the two Houses, had desperately Moved <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in the House of Peers, where he had a great Faction, that it would Adjourn for six Months; in which time the Malignant Party, of which he might well be thought the Head, and had the greatest influence upon the King's affections, would prevail so far, that all future hopes would be render'd desperate, and the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> be utterly lost, and possessed by the Papists: that they were therefore to take this op∣portunity, which God had given them, to remove so Malignant and dangerous a person from the King, and one so suspected, from so im∣portant a Charge as the Cinque Ports, of which the Duke was Lord Warden, and to send to the Lords to joyn with them in a desire to the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> King to that purpose.</Q></P>
<P>ON the other side, it was objected, that <Q>“”whilst they were so Solli∣citous for their own Priviledges, and sensible of the breach and viola∣tion of them, they could not more Justify those, who had been the Advisers of such breaches, than by offering the like trespass to the Priviledges of the Peers: that the life of that Council depended on the liberty of Speech, and where there were so different minds, there must be different expressions, and if one House might take notice what the other House said, or did, within Those walls, the Lords would as well question Their Members, as they did now one of the Lords; which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> would take away all freedom of debate: that they could not examine the Circumstances, which attended that Motion, if any such was made; and therefore could not so much as, in their private understandings,
<PB N="321" REF="3410"/>
make a reasonable judgment of it, but that they were naturally to pre∣sume the circumstances were such, as took away the Offence of the Motion; for that the Major part of that House, where the words were spoken, and at the time when they were spoken, had, upon Solemn debate, concluded, that there was no Crime in them; and that they were not only the Proper, but the Only Judges in that case: and if the Commons should intermeddle therewith, it was no otherwise, than, by the strength of the Major part of the House of Commons, to make the Minor part of Lords Superior to the Major part of that House; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> which they would not suffer to be offered to Themselves.</Q></P>
<P>IT was alledged, <Q>“”that the Duke was a person of great Honour and integrity, and of so unblemished a fame, that in all the discovery of the Court offences, there was not any reflection upon Him. That his education had been, according to the best rules of the Greatest per∣sons, for some years beyond the Seas; and that, having spent more time in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> he visited <HI>Spain;</HI> where his great Quality being known, and no question as a Compliment to this Kingdom, with which it was then in streight Alliance and Confederacy, that King had con∣ferred the honour of Grandee upon him; which was of no other ad∣vantage <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> or signification to him, than to be Covered in the presence of that King, as the principal Subjects there are. That his affection to the Protestant Religion was unquestionable and very Eminent; and tho' his Sisters, who had been bred under their Mother, were Roman Catholicks, yet his Brothers, of whose education He had taken the sole care, were very good Protestants.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THAT his opinions in Parliament had been very Avowed, and were to be presumed to be according to his Conscience, in the profession of which he was so publick, that there was reason to believe he used no Ill arts in private; since he had the courage to do that Aloud, which <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> he had reason to believe would displease many. That it would be a great prejudice, and blemish to their Councils and Discoveries, if after so long discourse of a Malignant Party, and evil Counsellors, of which they had never yet named any, they should first brand This Lord with that imputation upon such a ground and occasion, as must include all those Lords who had absolved him, which was the Major part of the Lords. In a word, that it would look as if they had devised those New words to make men afraid, and keep them in reserve to apply to all those with whom they were Angry.</Q></P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding all this, and all the reason that could be spoken <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> on that part, and that there could be none on the other, after a debate of very many hours, till after nine of the Clock at Night (the latest that ever was in the Parliament, but that of the Remonstrance) in which it was evident, that they meant as far as in them lay, to Confound all those, whom they could not Convert; it was Resolved by the Majority of Voices, not Half of the House being present at that unseasonable time of the debate, <Q>“”that they should accuse the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> to the Lords to be one of the Malignant Party, and an evil Counsellor to his Majesty; and to desire them to joyn in a request to the King, that he might be re∣moved from any Office or imployment about his person;</Q> which was so∣lemnly <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> recommended to the Lords accordingly, and by them so far re∣ceived, that tho' the desire was rejected, no dislike or disapprobation of the Matter or the Manner was in the least discovered, or insisted on.</P>
<P>ALL things thus prepared, and so many Lords driven and kept from
<PB N="322" REF="3420"/>
the House, besides the Bishops, and they that stayed there, by this last in∣stance, instructed how to carry themselves, at least how they provoked the Good Lords to Protest, they resolved once more to try whether the House of Peers would be induced to joyn in the business of the Militia, which they had twice refused; and to that purpose, their old Friends of the City in the same numbers flocked to <HI>Westminster,</HI> but under the New, received, and allowed style of Petitioners; but as unlike Petitioners to any of those Lords or Commons, whom they understood to be Malignant, as the other Tumults had been. From these herds there were two notable Petitions delivered to the House of Commons, the one from the Porters, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> their number, as they said, consisting of fifteen thousand; the other under the title of many thousands of poor people in, and about the City of <HI>London</HI> The Porters, with great Eloquence, confessed <Q>the unexpressible “”pains, that Honourable House had taken for the Good of Church and State; which deserved to be recorded to their eternal fame, tho' the Effects of those unwearied endeavours were not produced, by reason of the prevalence of that adverse, malignant, blood-sucking, Rebellious party, by the power of which the Priviledges of Parliament, and the Li∣berty of the Subject was trampled upon, the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland</HI> in∣creased, and all succours and relief for that Kingdom obstructed. They <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> said, "that Trade had been long languishing, but was Now dead by the fears, jealousies, and distractions they lay under, for want of fortification of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nque Ports, which was a great incouragement to the Papists to make Insurrections, and did much animate a Forreign power to Invade us: that by the deadness of Trade they did want imployment in such a measure, as did make their lives very uncomfortable; therefore their Request was, that that extream necessity of theirs might be taken into serious consideration, and that the Honourable House of Commons would fall upon the speediest course for abating and quelling the pride, outrage, and insolency, of the adverse Party at home; that the land <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> might be secured by fortifying the Cinque Ports, and putting the peo∣ple into a posture of defence, that all their fears, or as many as could, might be removed, and that Trade might be again set up and opened, that their wants might be in some measure supplied. They further de∣sired that Justice might be done upon Offenders, according as the Atro∣city of their crimes had deserved; for if those things were any longer suspended, they should be forced to extremities not fit to be named, and to make good that saying, that Necessity hath no Law. They said, they had nothing to lose but their lives, and those they would willingly ex∣pose to the utmost peril, in defence of the House of Commons, accord∣ing <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to their Protestation, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>THE other was a Petition in the names of many thousands of poor peo∣ple, and brought by a multitude of such, who seemed prepared for any exploit. I have thought fit, for the rareness of it, and the rare Effect it produced, to insert that Petition in Terms as it was presented, Thus.</P>
<P>To the Honourable the House of Commons now assembled in Parliament.</P>
<Q>“”The humble Petition of many thousands of Poor People in and about the City of <HI>London.</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></Q>
<P><Q>“”HUMBLY sheweth, that your Petitioners have lain a long time under great pressures, and grievances both in Liberties and Consciences,
<PB N="323" REF="3430"/>
as hath been largely, and sundry times, shewed and declared, by se∣veral Petitions exhibited to this Honourable Assembly both by the Citizens, and Apprentices of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and divers Coun∣ties and parts of this Kingdom, from which we hoped long e're this, by your pious care, to have been delivered.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BuT now we, who are of the meanest rank and quality, being touched with penury, are very sensible of the approaching storms of Ruine, which hang over our heads, and threaten to overwhelm us, by rea∣son of the sad distractions occasioned chiefly and originally, as your <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Petitioners humbly conceive, by the prevalency of the Bishops, and the Popish Lords, and others of that Malignant Faction; who make abortive all good Motions, which tend to the Peace, and tranquil∣lity of this Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and have hitherto hindered the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding relief to our Brethren in <HI>Ireland,</HI> altho' they ly weltering in blood; which hath given such head to the Adversaries, that we justly fear the like calamities inevitably to befall us Here, when they have vented their rage and malice There.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”ALL which, occasions so great a decay and stop of Trade, that your Petitioners are utterly impoverished, and our miseries are grown <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> insupportable, we having allready spent all that little means, which we had formerly, by Gods blessing, and our great labour, obtained; and many of us have not, nor cannot tell where to get bread to sustain our selves and families; and others of us are allmost arrived at the some Port of calamity; so that unless some speedy remedy be taken for the removal of all such obstructions, which hinder the happy progress of your great endeavours, your Petitioners shall not rest in quietness, but shall be forced to lay hold on the next remedy, which is at hand, to remove the disturbers of our Peace; Want and neces∣sity <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> breaking the bounds of Modesty: and rather than your Peti∣tioners will suffer themselves, and their families, to perish through Hunger and necessity, tho' hitherto patiently groaned under, they cannot leave any means unessayed for their relief.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THE Cry therefore of the Poor, and Needy, your Poor Petitioners, is, that such persons, who are the obstacles of our peace, and hin∣derers of the happy proceedings of this Parliament, and the injoy∣ment of the looked for purity of Religion, safety of our lives, and return of our welfares, may be forthwith publickly declared, to the end they may be made manifest; the removal of whom we hum∣bly <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> conceive will be a Remedy to cure our miseries, and put a period to these distractions: and that those Noble worthies of the House of Peers, who concur with your happy Votes, may be earnestly desired to joyn with this Honourable House, and to Sit and Vote as one entire body; which we hope will remove from us our destructive Fears, and prevent that, which Apprehension will make the Wisest and Peaceablest men to put into Execution.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Lords sake hear us, and let our Religion, Lives, and Welfares be precious in your sight, that the loins of the Poor may bless you, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and pray, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER this scandalous, and extravagant Petition delivered, the House, according to its gracious custom, ordered thanks to be given for their great kindness. To the Which when it was delivered by the Speaker, who told them that the House was in consideration of those things,
<PB N="324" REF="3440"/>
whareof they complained, some of that rabble, no doubt as they had been taught, replied, <Q>“”that they never doubted the House of Com∣mons, but they heard all stuck in the Lord's House, and they desired to know the Names of those Peers, who hindered the agreement be∣tween the Good Lords, and the Commons:</Q> which they pressed with unheard of rudeness and importunity, and with a seeming unwillingness withdrew, whilst the House took the matter into further consideration.</P>
<P>YET notwithstanding this Provocation, and that it was urged by ma∣ny Members, some of which had been assaulted and ill intreated by that Rabble in their passage to the House, <Q>“”that the countenancing such Li∣centious <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> persons and proceedings would be a great blemish to their Counsels, they were again called in; and told, "that the House of Commons had endeavoured, and would continue those endeavours for their relief; and they doubted not, when they had delivered their Pe∣tition, and what they had said, to the Lords, which they would pre∣sently do, the causes of their evils would be found out, and some speedy course resolved upon for their relief; and therefore desired them with patience to attend a further Answer.</Q> And accordingly that Petition was solemnly read, and delivered to the Lords at a Conference; and the Conference no sooner ended, than M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hollis,</HI> one of those Five whom <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the King had accused a Month before of High-Treason, was sent to the Lords in a Message to desire them, <Q>“”that they would joyn with the House of Commons in their desire to the King about the Militia; to which he added, "that if that desire of the House of Commons was not assented to, he desired those Lords who were willing to concur, would find some means to make themselves known, that it might be known who were against them, and they might make it known to those, that sent them.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER which Motion, and Message, the Lords again resumed the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> debate; which the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> begun with a profession, <Q>“”that whosoever refused, in that particular, to joyn with the House of Commons, were,</Q> in His opinion, Enemies to the Common-wealth; when the Major part of that House had twice before refused to concur with them in it. Yet when his Lordship was questioned for that Un∣parliamentary language, all the other Lords of that Faction joined with him; and declared, "that it was Their opinion likewise: the Rabble being at the door to execute whatever they were directed: so that many Lords, out of a just indignation to see their Honours, and their Liber∣ties Sacrificed to the People by Themselves; others, out of real fear of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> being murthered, if they should, in that conjuncture of time, insist on their former resolutions, withdrawing themselves; the Major part of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords pass the Bill touching the Militia▪</NOTE> those, who stayed, concluded to joyn with the House of Commons in their desire concerning the Militia.</P>
<P>WITHIN two days after this agreement, and submission of the Lords, another Petition was presented to the Commons, in the name of the Inhabitants of the County of <HI>Surry,</HI> by a multitude of People, who were, or pretended to be, of that County, and Subscribed by above two thou∣sand hands. Their Petition was of the ordinary strain, full of devotion to the House of Commons, and offering to execute all their commands; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> but with it they presented likewise a Petition, which they intended to present to the Lords, if They approved it, and was Subscribed by above two thousand hands; by which it may appear Where that Petition was drawn, and When, however the hands were procured. The Petition
<PB N="325" REF="3450"/>
to the Lords took notice <Q>“”of their happy concurrence with the House of Commons in selting the Militia, and Forts, in such hands as the Common-wealth might Confide in, and the Kingdom in such a posture as might be for its defence, and safeguard: yet they complained of the miserable condition of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which, they said, by the delay it had found amongst their Lordships, notwithstanding the pressing endea∣vours of the House of Commons, together with many of their Lord∣ships, had been exposed to the inhuman cruelties of their mercyless Enemys. With like grief they apprehended the Distractions of this <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Nation, the composure of which was alltogether hopeless, so long as the King's Throne was surrounded with evil Counsellors, and so long as the Votes of Popish Lords, and Bishops, were continued in their House.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WHEREFORE they did humbly pray, and beseech their Lordships, that they would go on in a constant Union with the House of Com∣mons, in providing for the Kingdoms safety; that all evil Counsellors might be found out, <HI>Ireland</HI> relieved; that the Votes of the Popish Lords, and Bishops, might be speedily removed; that so the Peace of the Kingdom might be established, the Priviledges of Parliament vin∣dicated, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and the purity of Religion setled, and preserved. And, they said, they should be in duty obliged to defend, and maintain with their lives and Estates, their Lordships, as far as they should be united with the Honourable House of Commons in all their just and pious pro∣ceedings.</Q></P>
<P>WHICH Petition was read in the House of Commons, and approved, and the Petitioners thanked for their kind expressions therein; and then it was delivered by them at the Bar of the House of Peers▪ who, within a day or two, passed both the Bill for taking away the Bishops Votes, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">and the Bills touching the Bishops Votes, and Pressing.</NOTE> that concerning Pressing, which had lain so long desperate, whilst the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Lords came▪ and sate with freedom in the House.

<P>UPON the second day of <HI>February,</HI> some Members, appointed by both Houses, attended his Majesty at <HI>Windsor</HI> with their Petition, <Q>“”that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Houses Petition the King touching the Tower, F rts, and Militia, &amp;c. <HI>Feb 2.</HI></NOTE> he would forthwith put the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and all other Forts, and the whole Militia of the Kingdom into the hands of such persons, as should be recommended unto his Majesty by both Houses of Parlia∣ment; which, they assured themselves, would be a hopeful entrance into those courses, which, through God's blessing, should be effectual <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> for the removing all diffidence, and misapprehension between his Ma∣jesty and his People; and for establishing and enlarging the honour, greatness, and power of his Majesty, and Royal posterity; and for the restoring and confirming the Peace, and happiness, of his loyal Sub∣jects in all his Dominions. And to that their most necessary Petition, they said, they did, in all humility, expect his speedy and gracious An∣swer, the great Distractions, and Distempers of the Kingdom, not ad∣mitting any delay.</Q></P>
<P>AT the same time they likewise presented another Petition to him, concerning the accused Members; in which they besought him <Q>“”to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> give directions, that the Parliament might be informed before <HI>Friday</HI> next (which was within two days) what proof there was against them, that accordingly they might be called to a legal Trial; it being the undoubted right, and Priviledge of Parliament, that no Member of
<PB N="326" REF="3460"/>
Parliament could be proceeded against, without the consent of Par∣liament.</Q></P>
<P>HIS Majesty now found that these persons could not be compounded with, and that their purpose was, by degrees, to get so much Power into Their hands, that they need not care for what was left in His; and that the Lords were in no degree to be relied upon to maintain their Own Priviledges▪ much less to defend His Rites; and that they had the power generally to impose upon the Peoples Understanding contrary to their own Senses, and to perswade them, <Q>“”that they were in danger to be invaded by forreign Enemys,</Q> when the King was not only in peace <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> with all Christian Princes, but allmost all other Nations so imbroyled in War, that they all desired the Friendsh p and Assistance of <HI>England;</HI> none was in case or condition to disturb it: <Q>“”and that there was a decay and deadness of Trade, and Want and Poverty growing upon the whole Kingdom,</Q> when no man living had ever remember'd the like Plenty over the whole Land, and Trade was at that heigth, that the like had never been known.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re∣solves to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> HE resolved therefore to remove himself to a greater distance from <HI>London,</HI> where the Fears and Jealousies grew; and constantly to deny to pass any Act, that should be recommended to him from the two <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Houses, except what might concern <HI>Ireland,</HI> till he might have a full prospect of all they intended to demand, and an equal assurance how far they intended to gratify him for all his condescensions; which resolution was very Parliamentary, it having been rarely known, till this present Parliament, that the King consented to any Acts, till the determination of the Session.</P>
<P>THE truth is, when his Majesty found the extream ill success of the accusation against the Members, and that the Tumults, and the Peti∣tioners, were no other than an Army at the disposal of those, in whom he had no reason to put his confidence, and that all such, who expressed <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> any eminent zeal to his Service, would be taken from him under the style of Delinquents and Malignants, he resolved that the Queen, who was very full of fears, should go to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> Colonel <HI>Goring,</HI> who was Governour thereof, having found means to make good impressions again in their Majesties of his Fidelity; and that Himself would go to <HI>Hull,</HI> where his Magazine of Cannon, Arms, and Ammunition was; and that being secured in those strong places, whither they, who wished him well, might resort, and be protected, he would sit still, till they, who were over active, would come to reason.</P>
<P>BUT this, tho' resolved with so much secresy, that it was not com∣municated <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to three persons (as I have been since assured by those who knew) whether by the Treachery of one of those few, or by the Curio∣sity of others (which I rather believe) who found means to over-hear all private discourses (as both Bed▪Chambers were inhabited, and every corner possessed, by diligent▪Spies upon their Master, and Mistriss) was imparted to those, who procured those Orders before mentioned for <HI>Hull</HI> and <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> by reason whereof, and the advice, and promise of many Lords, <Q>“”that they would firmly unite themselves for the just support of the Regal power,</Q> with the extream apprehension the Queen had of danger, that Counsel was laid aside. That, which wrought so <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> much upon the Queens fears, besides the general observation how the King was betrayed, and how his Rights, and Power, were every day wrested from him, was an advertisement, that she had received, of a
<PB N="327" REF="3470"/>
design in the prevalent Party to have accused her Majesty of High-Trea∣son; of which, without doubt, there had been some discourse in their most private Cabals, and, I am perswaded, was imparted to her upon design, and by connivance (for there were some incorporated into that Faction, who exactly knew her nature, passions, and infirmities) that the disdain of it might transport her to somewhat which might give Them advantage. And shortly after that discovery to her Majesty, those persons before mentioned were accused of High-Treason; yet afterwards, when they had received the full fruites, they found means to complain, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”as a great argument of the malignity of those persons of nearness to both their Majesties, that an infusion had been made to the Queen, that there was a purpose of accusing her of High-Treason,</Q> and solemn∣ly by Message <Q>“”besought her to discover, Who had done that malitious Office;</Q> when they very well knew Who it was, and for Whose sake the Queen was brought to return Answer, <Q>“”that she had heard such a discourse, but took no notice of it,</Q> as never believing it; whereas if she could have been compelled to have discovered, how they knew that the Queen had been informed, all the secret would have appeared; the same person first telling her what was in projection against her, and then re∣turning <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Intelligence of any expressions, and distemper, he might easily observe upon the apprehension which the other begot.</P>
<P>BUT both King and Queen were then upon that disadvantage, that all their words, and actions, which were the pure results of their own reasons, and judgments upon what they saw every day occurred, were called the effects of evil Counsels, that so they might take the liberty to reproach them with the more licence; whilst what they received by the most secret perjury of Bed▪Chamber Spies, or what they forged themselves, was urged as the result of common Fame, or the effects of their Fears and Jealousies, to the rancour of which the most precious <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> balm of the Crown must be applied. And therefore it was concluded, <Q>“”that the Queen should take the opportunity of her Daughter the Prin∣cess <HI>Mary's</HI> Journey into <HI>Holland</HI> (who had been before married to the young Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI></Q> and was now solemnly desired by the States Embassadours to come into that Country) <Q>“”to transport her self into <HI>Holland,</HI> patiently to expect an amendment of the affairs of <HI>England;</HI> and that the King should retire into the North, and reside at <HI>York,</HI> and deny all Particulars, till the Whole alteration should be framed.</Q> But the first resolution concerning the Queen was only published, the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> other, concerning the King, communicated to very few; both their Ma∣jesties being reduced to so great wants, that the Queen was compelled to coyn, or sell, her Chamber Plate for the supply of her most necessary occasions, there being no money in the Exchequer, or in the power of the Ministers of the Revenue; the Officers of the Customs, out of which the allowance for the weekly support of their Majesties Houshold had been made, being injoined by the House of Commons, not to issue out any money, without their particular consent, and approbation.</P>
<P>IT was evident now that the accused Members were too mighty for the King or the Law, and that they would admit no other Judges of their guilt, than Themselves, nor rules of proceeding than the Plurality <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of their Own voices: and therefore the King resolved to give over any more thought of that business. And so to that Petition he Answered, <Q>“”that as he once conceived that he had ground enough to accuse them, so Now he found as good cause wholely to wave any prosecution of
<PB N="328" REF="3480"/>
them.</Q> The other Petition concerning the Militia gave him more trouble; for tho▪ he was resolved in no degree to consent to it, yet he was willing, till all things could be ready for the Queen's Journey, and so for his own remove, father to Delay it, than Deny it; lest the same Army of Petitioners might come to <HI>Windsor</HI> to perswade him, which had Converted, or prevailed over the House of Peers. And he was per∣swaded by some, who thought they knew the temper of both Houses, that tho▪ they were now united in the Matter, they might easily be di∣vided upon the Circumstances: and that they would not be of one mind in the election of the Persons to be Confided in. So that to that Peti∣tion <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty returned this Answer:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King s Answer to the Petition con∣cerning the Militia.</NOTE> <Q>“”THAT he was willing to apply a remedy not only to their Dangers, but to their Doubts and Fears; and therefore that when he should know the extent of power, which was intended to be established in those persons, whom they desired to be Commanders of the Militia in the several Counties, and likewise to what time it should be limited, that no power should be executed by his Majesty alone without the advice of Parliament, Then he would declare that he would be content to put in all the Forts, and over the Militia, such persons as both Houses of Parliament should either approve, or recommend to him; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> so that they before declared the names of the persons, whom they would approve or recommend; and so that no Persons should be named by them, against whom his Majesty should have just, and Un∣questionable exception.</Q></P>
<P>WHICH Answer, tho' it was not a Consent, gave them notable incou∣ragement, and exceedingly united the vulgar minds to them; who con∣curred only with them, as they saw them like to Prevail in what they went about. And there was no danger of any disunion in the Nomi∣nation of Persons; because, tho▪ they should at first admit such into the Number, whom they could not sufficiently trust, nor plausibly except <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> against, yet when they were once possessed of the power of Nomina∣tion, they might easily Weed out those, which were not agreeable to the Soil they were planted in. However this would take up some time; and therefore to keep the King's inclination to gratify them (for so they would understand it) warm, the same day they received this Answer, they returned a Message of thanks; and desired his Majesty, <Q>“”whilst they were preparing all other particulars according to his com∣mand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The House of Common re∣turn the King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> may be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> that he would confer the custody of the Tower upon S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Coniers,</HI></Q> whom they had lately recommended to his Majesty as a per∣son of great merit. With which being surprized, and desired likewise <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Byron</HI> to free him from the Agony and vexation of that place, which had exposed his person and reputation to the rage and fury of the People, and compelled him to submit to such reproaches, as a generous Spirit could not brook without much regret; for he had upon frivolous surmises been sent for as a Delinquent, and been brought upon his knees<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to it</NOTE> at the Par of both Houses; his Majesty consented to that alteration, and made S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Coniers</HI> Lieutenant of the Tower. Which was such an instance of his yielding upon Importunity, that from That time they thought themselves even possessed of the whole Militia of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>WHILST all diligence was used in making preparation for the Queens <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Journey; to divert their Councils from other inquisition, the King (who had received so many sharp expostulations for breach of Priviledges, and other attemps upon their reputations) resolved upon the publication
<PB N="329" REF="3490"/>
of a bold scandal upon himself by one of their principal Members, to expostulate with them, and try what satisfaction and reparation they were prepared to Give him, who exacted so much From him. All op∣portunities had been taken in Publick, and all licence given to Private and clandestine forgeries to lay odious, or envious imputation on the King and Queen, in the business of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and to impute the pro∣gress and success of that Rebellion to a connivance, if not a counte∣nance, from the Court: the not levying men, and sending provisions, imputed to his Majesty; tho' he had, as is before observed, offered to levy <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> ten thousand Voluntiers for that Service, and had consented chearfully to every proposition, that had been made with the least reference to the assistance of that Kingdom. Indeed he was so alarm'd with those per∣petual odious suggestions, which he perceived wrought very pernicious effects in the minds of the People, that he was compelled to consent to many things contrary to his judgment, and Kingly policy, to prevent greater inconveniences by those scandals, which he saw were prepared for him. So when several Propositions were recommended to him by the two Houses concerning those Supplies, which were to be sent out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> amongst the rest, there was one, <Q>“”that the Scots should <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> have the Command, and keeping of the Town, and Castle of <HI>Carrick∣sergus;</HI> and if any Regiments, or Troops, in that Province should joyn with them, that they should receive Orders from the Com∣mander of the Scotish Forces.</Q> The King consented to all the rest, tho' there were matters unreasonable enough in favour of that Nation; but "That, he said, "he could not approve of; and wished <Q>“”the Houses to take that Proposition again into consideration, as a business of very great importance, which he doubted might prove prejudicial to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and the Service intended. And he said, if the Houses desired it, he would be willing to speak with the Scotish Com∣missioners,</Q> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to see what satisfaction he could give them therein. This Answer was no sooner read, but both Houses Voted, <Q>“”that whosoever gave the King advice, or counsel, to send that Answer, was an Enemy to the King, and Kingdom,</Q> and a Committee appointed to find out who those evil Counsellors were. So that, the Scotish Commissioners pressing him, <Q>“”that being their Native King▪ he would not publish a less Trust and confidence in them, than their Neighbour Nation had done,</Q> his Majesty thought fit to consent to the whole, as the two Houses had advised.</P>
<P>THEN, in the carrying on the War, they allowed his Majesty so lit∣tle <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> power, that when he recommended some Officers of prime qua∣lity, reputation, and experience in the War, to the Lord Lieutenant to be imployed in that Service, the House of Commons by express Or∣der, and after they knew that his Majesty had recommended them, re∣jected them, because they were taken notice to have attended upon the King at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> as a Guard to his person. And after all this, they took all occasions to asperse him with any omissions that were in that great work; as M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> had more particularly done, in that Speech before taken notice of, at the Conference with the Lords, upon the delivery of those Seditious Petitions; of which the King could not <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> take notice, lest he should be again reproached with breach of Privi∣ledge.</P>
<P>BUT when that Speech was printed by Order of the House, the King thought he had an opportunity to require a vindication; and therefore,
<PB N="330" REF="3500"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de∣mands repara¦tion for an ex∣pression in a printed Speech of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI>▪s</NOTE> in a letter to the Speaker, he sent this Message: <Q>“”That he had taken notice of a Speech, pretended by the title to have been delivered by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> in a Conference, and printed by Order of the House of Com∣mons; in which it was affirmed, that Since the stop upon the Ports against all Irish Papists of both Houses, many of the chief Commanders, now in the head of the Rebels, have been suffered to pass by his Ma∣jesty's immediate Warrant: and being certain of having used extream caution in the granting of Pass-Ports into <HI>Ireland,</HI> he conceived, either that Paper not to have been so delivered, and printed, as is pretended; or that House to have received some misinformation. And therefore <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty desired to know, whether that Speech had been so deli∣vered, and printed; and if it had, that the House would review, upon what information that particular had been grounded, that either it might be found upon reexamination false, and so both the House, and his Majesty to have been injured by it; or that his Majesty might know, by what means, and by whose fault, his Authority had been so highly abused, as to be made to conduce to the assistance of that Re∣bellion, which he so much detested and abhorred; and that he might see himself fully vindicated from all reflections of the least suspition of that kind. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The House of Commons An∣swer.</NOTE> IT was some time before they would vouchsafe any Answer to the King upon this Message; but at last they returned, <Q>“”that the Speech, mentioned in that Message, was printed by their Order, and what was therein dellvered, was agreeable to the sense of the House. That they had received divers advertisements concerning the several persons, Irish Papists, and others, who had obtained his Majesty's immediate War∣rant for their passing into <HI>Ireland,</HI> Since the Order of restraint of both Houses; some of which, as they had been informed, since their com∣ing into <HI>Ireland,</HI> had joined with the Rebels, and been Commanders amongst them; and some others had been stayed, and were yet in safe <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Custody.</Q></P>
<P>THEN they named some, to whom Licences had been granted Before the Order of restraint, and were still in <HI>England;</HI> and said, <Q>“”there were others, whose Names they had not yet received, but doubted not, upon examination, they would be discovered.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's reply.</NOTE> To this the King replyed, and told them, <Q>“”that as He had expressed a great desire to give Them all possible satisfaction to all their just re∣quests, and a readiness to rectify, or retract, any thing done by him∣self, which might seem to intrench upon their Priviledges by any mistake of his; so, he hoped, They would be ready, upon all occasions, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to manifest an equal tenderness and regard of His Honour, and reputa∣tion with his Subjects: and therefore, he expected they should review his Message concerning M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI>'s Speech, and their Answer, with which he could not rest satisfied. He said, he was most assured that No person, who had command in the head of the Rebels, had passed by his War∣rant, or Privity. And then, he desired them to consider, whether such a General information, and advertisement, as they implied in their An∣swer, without the Name of any Particular person, was a ground enough for such a direct and positive Affirmation, as was made in that Speech; which, in respect of the place and person, and being now acknowledged <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to be according to the sense of the House, was of that Authority, that his Majesty might suffer in the Affections of many of his good Subjects, and fall under a possible construction, considering many scandalous
<PB N="331" REF="3510"/>
Pamphlet to such a purpose, of not being sensible enough of that Re∣bellion, so horrid, and odious to all Christians; by which, in that distraction, such a danger might possibly insue to his Majesty's person, and Estate, as he was well assured they would endeavour to prevent. And therefore, he thought it very necessary, and expected that they should Name those persons, who had passed by his Licence, and were then in the head of the Rebels: or if, upon their reexamination, they did not find Particular evidence to prove that assertion (as he was most confident they never could) as that Affirmation, which reflected upon <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty was very Publick, so they would publish such a Declara∣tion, whereby that mistake might be discovered; he being the more tender in that particular, which had reference to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and being most assured, that he had been, and was, from his Soul, resolved to discharge his duty, for the relief of his poor Protestant Subjects, and the utter rooting out that Rebellion; so that Service had not suf∣fer'd for the want of any thing proposed to him, and within His power to grant.</Q></P>
<P>He said, <Q>“”in this matter he had diligently examined his own me∣mory,</Q> and the notes of his Secretaries; and then named all the Irish <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> persons to whom he had given any Licences to go into that King∣dom, since the beginning of that Rebellion; and said, <Q>“”he was well assured, none of Them were with the Rebels; and tho' some of them might be Papists, yet he had no reason to have any suspition of them, in respect of their alliance with persons of great Honour and Power in that Kingdom, of whose fidelity to him he had good assurance; and the Lords Justices Themselves having declared, that they were so far from owning a jealousy of All Papists there, that they had put Arms into the Hands of divers Noblemen of that Religion, within the Pale, which the Parliament had well approved of. And therefore, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> unless the first Affirmation of the House of Commons could be made good by some Particulars, he expected a vindication by such a De∣claration as he had proposed; which, he said, was, in duty and Justice, due to him.</Q></P>
<P>BUT this, and any thing else could be said, was so far from pro∣curing any Reparation, that when they perceived the King still pressed for that Justice, and apprehended that many would believe it due to him, and that the prejudice they had raised to him for <HI>Ireland</HI> would be removed thereby, they confidently published another Declaration of several persons Names, to whom they said the King had granted <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Passes, and were then Commanders in the Rebels Army, of whose Names his Majesty had never before heard, to whom no Passes had been granted, neither did he believe that there were such men in Na∣ture: and so left the People to believe as they found themselves in∣clined upon the Kings denial, or Their so Particular, and positive affir∣mation.</P>
<P>THESE proceedings of the Parliament made a deep impression upon all Noble and generous persons, who found that their Pride, and Am∣bition was so great, that they resolved to remove all persons, who were like to stand in their way by opposing any thing they desired, or <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> by filling any place, or office, which they designed should be executed by some other person, in whom they could Confide. The Earl of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> who was Governour to the Prince, knew very well in what prejudice he stood with the Earls of <HI>Essex,</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> (two very
<PB N="332" REF="3520"/>
powerful persons) upon the Account of the Challenge formerly men∣tioned to be sent by him to the latter of the two, who would be glad of any opportunity to expose him to an affront; and that they would find occasions enough upon the account of his known affections to the King's Service, from which it was not possible to remove or startle him. He knew they liked not that he should have the Government of the Prince, as one, who would infuse such principles into him, as would not be agreeable to their Designs, and would dispose him to no kind∣ness to their Persons, and that they would not rest, till they saw ano∣ther man in that province; in order to which, they would pick all quar∣rels <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> they could, and load him with all reproaches, which might blast him with the People, with whom he had a very good reputation. Upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>New-Castle</HI> resigns his place of Go∣vernour to the Prince.</NOTE> those considerations, and some other imaginations upon the prospect of Affairs, he very Wisely resolved to retire from the Court, where he had expended much of his own Fortune, and only made himself obnoxious to the malice, and envy of other pretenders; and desired the King to approve of this his reasonable inclination, and to put the Prince un∣der the Tuition of some person of Honour of unquestionable fidelity to him, and above the reach of Popular disapprobation; and, at the same time mentioned the Marquess of <HI>Hartford,</HI> who was indeed Superiour <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to any Temptations. The King could not dislike the Earls Judgment upon his own interest, and concernment; and did foresee likewise that he might probably have occasion to use his Service under another qua∣lification; and therefore was well contented to dismiss him from the Prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marquess of <HI>Hartford</HI> succeeds him.</NOTE> THE Marquess of <HI>Hartford</HI> was a man of great Honour, Interest, and Estate, and of an universal esteem over the whole Kingdom; and tho' he had received many, and continued disobligations, from the Court, from the time of this King's coming to the Crown, as well as during the Reign of King <HI>James,</HI> in both which seasons, more than ordinary care had been <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> taken to discountenance and lessen his Interest; yet he had carried himself with notable steadiness, from the beginning of the Parliament, in the sup∣port and defence of the King's power and dignity, notwithstanding all his Allies, and those, with whom he had the greatest familiarity and Friendship, were of the opposite Party; and never concurred with them against the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> whom he was known not to love, nor in any other extravagancy.</P>
<P>AND then, he was not to be shaken in his affection to the Govern∣ment of the Church; tho' it was enough known that he was in no de∣gree by assed to any great inclination to the Person of any Church-man. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> And with all this, that Party carried themselves towards him with pro∣found respect, not presuming to venture their own credit in endeavour∣ing to lessen His.</P>
<P>IT is very true, he wanted some of those qualities, which might have been wished to be in a person to be trusted in the education of a great, and hopeful Prince, and in forming of his mind and manners in so ten∣der an age. He was of an age not fit for much activity and fatigue, and loved, and was even wedded so much to his ease, that he loved his book above all exercises; and had even contracted such a laziness of mind, that he had no delight in an open and liberal Conversation; and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> cared not to discourse, and argue on those points, which he understood very well, only for the trouble of contending; and could never im∣pose upon himself the pain, that was necessary to be undergone in such a
<PB N="333" REF="3530"/>
perpetual attendance: but then those lesser duties might be otherwise provided for, and he could well Support the dignity of a Governour, and exact that diligence from others, which he could not exercise Him∣self; and his honour was so unblemished, that none durst murmur against the designation; and therefore his Majesty thought him very worthy of the high Trust, against which there was no other exception, but that he was not ambitious of it, nor intruth willing to receive and undergo the charge, so contrary to his natural constitution. But in his pure zeal and affection for the Crown, and the conscience, that in <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> this conjuncture his submission might advance the King's Service, and that the refusing it might prove disadvantagious to his Majesty, he very chearfully undertook the Province, to the general satisfaction and pub∣lick joy of the whole Kingdom; and to the no little honour and credit of the Court, that so important and beloved a person would Attach him∣self to it under such a relation, when so many, who had scarce ever ea∣ten any bread but the King's, Detached themselves from their depen∣dance, that they might without him, and Against him, preserve and im∣prove those Fortunes, which they had procured and gotten Under him, and by his Bounty.</P>

Votes allready, they being not suffer'd to come to the House, and the Major part in prison under an accusation of High-Treason, of which there was not like to be any Reformation, till these present distem∣pers were composed; and then that by his Power, and the memory of the Indirect means that had been used against them, it would be easier to bring them in Again, than to keep them in Now. They told him, there were two matters of great Importance pressed upon him for his Royal Assent, but they were not of equal consequence, and concernment to his Soveraign Power; the first, that Bill touch∣ing the Bishops Votes; the other, the whole Militia of the King∣dom, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the granting of which would absolutely devest him of all Re∣gal Power; that he would not be able to deny Both; but by grant∣ing the former, in which he parted with no matter of Moment, he would, it may be, not be pressed in the second; or if he were, that as he could not have a more Popular quarrel to take up Arms, than to defend himself, and preserve that power in his hands, which the Law had vested in him, and without which he could not be a King; so he could not have a more Unpopular argument for that contention, than the preservation of the Bishops in the House of Peers, which few men thought Essential, and most men believed Prejudicial, to the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> peace and happiness of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THESE arguments, tho▪ used by men whom he most trusted, and whom he knew to have opposed that Bill in its passage, and to be cor∣dially friends to the Church of <HI>England</HI> in Discipline and Doctrine, prevailed not so much with his Majesty, as the Perswasions of the Queen; who was not only perswaded to think those reasons valid (and there are that believe that infusion to have been made in her by her own Priests, by Instructions from <HI>France,</HI> and for reasons of State of that Kingdom) but that her own safety very much depended upon the King's consent to That Bill; and that, if he should refuse it, her Jour∣ney <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> into <HI>Holland</HI> would be crossed by the Parliament, and possibly her Person in danger either by the Tumult, which might easily be brought to <HI>Windsor</HI> from <HI>Westminster,</HI> or by the insurrection of the Countries in her passage from thence to <HI>Dover,</HI> where she intended to take shipping. Whereas by her intercession with the King to do it, she would lay a most seasonable and Popular obligation upon the whole Nation, and leave a pleasant odour of her grace and favour to the People, behind her, which would prove much to her advantage in her absence; and she should have the thanks for that Act, as acquired by Her good∣ness, which otherwise would be extorted from the King, when she was <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> gone.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es that Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, and the other of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Feb. 14.</HI></NOTE> THESE insinuations and discourses so far satisfied the Queen, and She the King, that, contrary to his most positive resolution, the King consented, and sent a Commission for the enacting both that Bill, and the other about Pressing; which was done accordingly to the great triumph of the Boutefeus, the King sending the same day that he passed those Bills, which was the fourteenth of <HI>February,</HI> a Message to both Houses; <Q>“”that he was assured his having passed those two Bills, be∣ing of so great importance, so suddainly, would serve to assure his Parliament, that he desired nothing more than the satisfaction of his <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Kingdom. For <HI>Ireland,</HI> he said, as he had concurred in all Propo∣sitions made for that Service by his Parliament, so he was resolved to leave nothing undone for their relief, which should possibly fall
<PB N="335" REF="3550"/>
within his power, nor would refuse to venture his own Person in that War, if the Parliament should think it convenient for the reduction of that miserable Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THE passing that Bill for taking away the Bishops Votes, exceed∣ingly weaken'd the King's Party; not only as it swept away so con∣siderable a number out of the House of Peers, which were constant∣ly devoted to him; but as it made impression on others, whose minds were in suspence, as when Foundations are shaken. Besides, they that were best acquainted with the King's nature, opinions, and resolu∣tions, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> had reason to believe, that no exigence could have wrought upon him to have consented to so Anti-Monarchical an Act; and there∣fore, never after retained any confidence, that he would deny what was Importunately asked; and so, either absolutely withdrew them∣selves from those consultations, thereby avoiding the envy, and the danger of opposing them, or quietly suffer'd themselves to be carried by the Stream, and to consent to any thing that was Boldly and Lustily attempted.</P>
<P>AND then it was so far from dividing the other Party, that I do not remember One man, who vehemently insisted on, or indeed heartily <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> wished, the passing of that Bill, that ever deserted them, till the King∣dom was in a flame: but on the contrary, very many, who cordially and constantly opposed that Act, as freinds rather to Monarchy than Religion, after that Bill, never considered or resisted any attempt, or further alteration, in the Church, looking on the Bishops as useless to Soveraignty, and so not of importance enough to be defended by the Sword. And I have heard the same men, who urged Before, <Q>“”that their places in that House had no relation to the Discipline of the Church, and their Spiritual Jurisdiction, and therefore ought to be Sacrificed to the Preservation of the other, upon which the Peace, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and unity of Religion so much depended, Since argue, "that Since their power in that House, which was a good Outwork to defend the King's from invasion, was taken away, any other form of Govern∣ment would be equally advantagious to his Majesty; and therefore, that he ought not to insist on it, with the least inconvenience to his condition.</Q></P>
<P>BUT that which was above, or equal to all this, was that by his Majesty's enacting those two Bills, he had, upon the matter, approved the Circumstances of their passage, which had been by direct violence, and allmost force of armes; in which case, he ought not to have con∣firmed <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the most Politick, or the most Pious constitutions: <HI>Male po∣sita est Lex, quae tumultuarie posita est,</HI> was one of those positions of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> which hath Never been since contradicted; and was an advantage, that, being well managed, and stoutly insisted upon, would, in spight of all their Machinations, which were not Yet firmly and solidly formed, have brought them to a temper of being Treated with. But I have some cause to believe, that even this argument, which was Unanswerable for the Rejecting that Bill, was applied for the Con∣firming it; and an opinion that the violence, and force, used in pro∣curing it, render'd it absolutely Invalid and Void, made the Confirma∣tion <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of it less considered, as not being of strength to make that Act good, which was in it Self Null. And I doubt this Logick had an influence upon other Acts of no less Moment than these: but it was an Erroneous and Unskilful suggestion; for an Act of Parliament,
<PB N="336" REF="3560"/>
what circumstances soever concurred in the contriving and framing it, will be allways of too great reputation to be avoided, or to be declared Void, by the sole Authority of any Private persons, or the Single power of the King Himself. And tho' the wisdom, sobriety, and power, of a future Parliament, if God shall ever bless the King∣dom with another Regularly constituted, may find cause to declare this, or that Act of Parliament, Void; yet there will be the same tem∣per requisite to such a Declaration, as would serve to Repeal it. And it may be Then, many men, who abhorred the thing when it was done, for the Manner of doing it, will be of the Civilians opinion, <HI>fieri</HI> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <HI>non debuit, factum valet;</HI> and never consent to the Altering of that, which they would never have consented to the Establishing of; nei∣ther will that Single President of the Judges in the case of King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the Seventh, when they declared the Act of Attainder to be Void by the accession of the Crown (tho' if he had intruth been the person, upon whom the Crown had lineally and Rightfully descended, it was good Law) find, or make, the Judges of another age parallel to Them, till the King hath as strong a Sword in his hand, and the People as much at his devotion and disposal; and then the Making, and De∣claring Law, will be of equal Facility, tho', it may be, not of equal <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Justice. How much soever the King's Friends were, for the reasons aforesaid, dejected upon the passing those two Acts, it is certain, they who thought They got whatsoever He lost, were mightily exalted, and thought themselves now Superior to any opposition: And what returns of duty and acknowledgment they made to the King for that Grace and Favour, is to be remember'd in the next place.</P>
<P>THE same day those two Acts were by his Majesty's Commission passed, and as soon as a very short Message of thanks for that favour, as much importing the safety of both Kingdoms, of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> was consented to, an Ordinance for the setling the Militia was <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> agreed on by both Houses, and, together with a list of the Names of such persons, as for the present they meant to Confide in, was immediately sent to the King for his approbation; the which, being the most Avow∣ed foundation of all the Miseries that have followed, will be here ne∣cessary to be inserted in the very terms and form it was agreed upon, and presented; and was as followeth.</P>

<P>A second Act of the same day, and the only way they took to re∣turn their thanks and acknowledgment to the Queen for her intercession, and mediation in the passing those Bills, was the opening a Letter they intercepted, which was directed to her Majesty. The Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> af∣ter their Majesty's going to <HI>Windsor,</HI> when he found in what umbrage he stood with the powerful and prevailing Party, and that they were able to improve his going through a Town in a Coach and six horses to <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> a Warlike appearance, and so to expose him to the fury of the People, at least to the power of the Counties, to be supressed, as they had done by their Order, or Proclamation of the twelfth of <HI>January,</HI> before re∣member'd, and appointed to be read in all Market Towns throughout <HI>England;</HI> concluded for his own security, and to free the King's Coun∣cils from the imputation of his evil influence, to remove himself into some parts beyond the Seas: and so, by the King's leave, and by his licence, was transported into <HI>Holland,</HI> from whence he writ some Let∣ters to his friends at <HI>London,</HI> to give them an account where he was, and for supplying himself with such accommodations as he stood in need <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of. Amongst these Letters there was one to his Brother in Law S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lewis Dives,</HI> which, by the treachery of that person, to whose care it was int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usced for conveyance, was brought to the House of Commons; and it being averred, "that it came from the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> whom they
<PB N="338" REF="3580"/>
looked upon as a Fugitive, they made no scruple of opening it; and finding another in it directed to the Queen, after a very little pause they did the like; for which they made no other excuse (when upon a Message from the King they sent her the transcript, for the Original they still kept) than, <Q>“”that having opened the other Letters, and finding in them sundry expressions full of asperity, and malignity to the Parlia∣ment, they thought it very probable, that the like might be contained in that to her Majesty; and that it would have been dishonourable to her Majesty, and dangerous to the Kingdom, if it should not have been opened: And they besought the King to perswade her Majesty, that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> she would not vouchsafe any countenance to, or correspondence with, the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> or any other of the Fugitives or Traytors, whose offences were under the examination and judgment of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>IN that Letter to the Queen were these words, <Q>“”If the King be∣take himself to a safe place, where he may avow and protect his ser∣vants (from rage I mean and violence; for from justice I will never implore it) I shall then live in impatience, and in misery, till I wait upon you. But if, after all he hath done of late, he shall betake him∣self to the easiest and complyantest ways of accommodation, I am confident, that then I shall serve him more by my absence, than by <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> all▪ my industry. And in that to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lewis Dives,</HI> were these words: God knows, I have not a thought to make me blush towards my Country, much less criminal; but where Traytors have so great a sway,</Q> the honestest thoughts may prove most Treasonable. Which gave those, that thought themselves concern'd, so great offence, that, within two days after, they accused him of High-Treason; and finding no words in the Letter would amount to that offence, they accused him of levying War against the King; which could have relation to no Act of his, but what was before mentioned at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> when, to the terrour of the King▪s Subjects, he was seen there in a Coach with <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> six Horses. Tho' this extravagancy of theirs seems to be directed against a particular person, I could not omit it in this place, being accompanied with those circumstances. And it may be, posterity may look upon the severe prosecution of a young Noble-man of admirable parts, and emi∣nent hopes, in so implacable a manner, as a most pertinent instance of the Tyranny, and Injustice of that time, not possible to end, but in so much wickedness as hath since been practised.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Attorney General is im∣peack'd by the Commons.</NOTE> A THIRD Act of that day was the carrying up an Impeachment to the Lords against the King's Atturney General, <Q>“”for maliciously advising and contriving the Articles upon which the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hollis,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hambden,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Strode,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Arthur Haslerigg,</HI> had been accused by his Majesty of High-Treason;</Q> it being not thought secu∣rity and reparation enough, that the King had waved any further pro∣ceeding against them, except they left such a monument of their power, that, upon what occasion or provocation soever, no man should pre∣sume to obey the King in the like command: so that the same fourteenth of <HI>February,</HI> that was celebrated for the King's condescension to that Act for putting the Bishops out of the House of Peers, is famous like∣wise for those three Unparallelled Acts of contempt upon the Soveraign power; the demand of the sole power over all the Militia of the King∣dom; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the opening Letters directed to the Sacred person of the Queen; and the impeaching the Atturney General, for performing, what he took to be the duty of his place, by his Master's command. All which
<PB N="339" REF="3590"/>
were very ill instances of that application and compliance his Majesty had reason to expect, and some men had promised him he should receive.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer con∣cerning the Militia.</NOTE> THO' the King was resolved in no degree to consent to the Propo∣sition for the Militia, yet he thought not the time seasonable for his positive Denyal, the Queen retaining still her fears of being stopped in her Journey. Therefore, for the present, he returned Answer, <Q>“”that his dearest Consort the Queen, and his dear Daughter the Princess <HI>Mary,</HI> being then upon their departure for <HI>Holland,</HI> he could not have so good time to consider of a particular answer for a matter of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> so great weight, as That was; and therefore, he would respite the same till his return:</Q> the King intending to accompany the Queen to <HI>Dover,</HI> and as soon as she was imbarked to return. They received this An∣swer with their usual impatience, and the next day sent Messengers to him, with that, which they called an Humble Petition; in which they told him, <Q>“”that they had, with a great deal of grief, received his Answer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Reply.</NOTE> to their just and necessary Petition concerning the Militia of the King∣dom; which, by a gracious Message formerly sent unto them, he had been pleased to promise should be put into such hands, as his Parlia∣liament should approve of, the extent of their power, and the time of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> their continuance, being likewise declared; the which being now done, and the persons Nominated, his Majesty nevertheless reserved his re∣solution to a longer, and a very uncertain time; which, they said, was as unsatisfactory and destructive as an absolute Denial. Therefore, they once again besought him to take their desire into his Royal thoughts, and to give them such an Answer, as might raise in them a Considence, that they should not be exposed to the practices of those, who thirst after the ruin of this Kingdom, and the kindling of that combustion in <HI>England,</HI> which they had in so great a measure effected in <HI>Ireland;</HI> from whence, as they were informed, they intended to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> invade this Kingdom, with the assistance of the Papists here. They said, nothing could prevent those evils, nor inable them to suppress the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and secure Themselves, but the Instant granting of that their Petition; which, they hoped, his Majesty would not deny to those, who must, in the discharge of their duty to his Majesty and the Common-wealth, represent unto him, what they found so abso∣lutely necessary for the preservation of both; which the Laws of God and man injoined them to see put in execution, as several Counties by their daily Petitions desired Them to do, and in some places begun all∣ready to Do it of Themselves. Notwithstanding all that importunity, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the King made no other Answer than formerly he had done, "that he would give a full Answer at his return from <HI>Dover.</HI></Q></P>

And for That, tho' he believed it, upon the information since given him, to be a breach of their Priviledges, and had offer'd, and was ready, to repair the same for the future, by any Act should be desired from his Majesty; yet he must declare, and require to be be∣lieved, that he had no other design upon that House, or any Member of it, than to require, as he did, the persons of those five Gentlemen <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> he had before accused of High-Treason, and to declare that he meant to proceed against them Legally, and Speedily; upon which he be∣lieved that House would have delivered them up.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”He called the Allmighty God to witness, that he was so far from any intention, or thought of force or violence, alltho' that House had not delivered them according to his demand, or in any case whatso∣ever, that he gave those his Servants, and others, who then waited on his Majesty, express charge and command, that they should give no offence unto any man; nay if they received any provocation or injury, that they should bear it without return; and he neither saw, nor knew, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that any person of his train had any other weapons, but his Pensioners and Guard, those with which they Usually attend his person to Parlia∣ment; and the other Gentlemen, Swords. And therefore he doubted not, but the Parliament would be regardful of his Honour therein, that
<PB N="342" REF="3620"/>
he should not undergo any imputation by the rash and indiscreet ex∣pressions of any young men then in his train, or by any desperate words utter'd by others, who might mingle with them without His consent or approbation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the persons Nominated to be the Lieutenants of the several Counties of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> he said he was contented to allow that recommendation; only concerning the City of <HI>London,</HI> and such other Corporations as by ancient Charters had granted to them the power of the Militia, he did not conceive that it could stand with Justice or Policy to alter their Government in that particular. And he was <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> willing forthwith to grant to every one of them, that of <HI>London</HI> and other Corporations excepted, such Commissions, as he had granted this Parliament to some Lords Lieutenants by their advice. But if that power were not thought enough, but that more should be thought fit to be granted to those persons named, than, by the Law, is in the Crown it self, he said, he thought it reasonable that the same should be by some Law first vested in Him, with power to transfer it to those per∣sons; which he would willingly do: and whatever that power should be, to avoid all future doubts and questions, he desired it might be di∣gested into an Act of Parliament, rather than an Ordinance; so that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> all his Subjects might thereby particularly know, both what they were to do, and what they were to suffer for their neglect; that so there might be the least latitude for them to suffer under any Arbitrary power whatsoever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”TO the time desired for the Continuance of the powers to be granted, he said, he could not consent to divest himself of the Just Power, which God, and the Laws of the Kingdom, had placed in him for the defence of his People, and to put it into the hands of others for any Indefinite time. And since the ground of their request to him was to secure their present Fears and Jealousies, that they might with safety apply them∣selves <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to his Message of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>January,</HI> he hoped that his Grace to them since that time, in yielding to so many of their desires, and in agreeing to the persons now recommended to him, and the power before expressed, to be placed in them, would wholely dispel those Fears and Jealousies; and he assured them, that as he had applied this Unusual remedy to their Doubts; so, if there should be cause, he would con∣tinue the same to such time, as should be agreeable to the same care he now expressed towards them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, he was so far from receding from any thing he had pro∣mised, or intended to grant in his former Answer, that he had hereby <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> consented to all that had been then asked of him by that Petition, con∣cerning the Militia of the Kingdom, except that of <HI>London</HI> and the other Corporations; which was, to put the same into the hands of such persons, as should be recommended to him by both Houses of Parlia∣ment. And he doubted not but they, upon well weighing the particu∣lars of that his Answer, would find the same more satisfactory to their ends, and the Peace and Welfare of all his good Subjects, than the way proposed by that intended Ordinance; to which, for those reasons, he could not consent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND whereas he observed by their late Petition, that in some places, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> some persons begun allready to intermeddle of Themselves with the Militia, he said, he expected his Parliament should examine the parti∣culars thereof, it being a matter of high concernment, and very great
<PB N="343" REF="3630"/>
consequence. And he required, that if it should appear to them, that any person whatsoever had presumed to command the Militia without lawful Authority,</Q> they might be proceeded against according to Law.</P>
<P>IT seems this was not the Answer they promised themselves; for, at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Votes of both Houses upon it.</NOTE> the publishing it, they were marvellously transported, and immediately Voted, both Houses concurring in it, <Q>“”that those, who advised his Ma∣jesty to give that Answer, were Enemies to the State, and mischievous projectors against the defence of the Kingdom: That that denial was of that dangerous consequence, that if his Majesty should persist in it, it <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> would hazard the peace and safety of all his Kingdoms, unless some speedy remedy were applied by the wisdom, and authority of both Houses of Parliament: And that such parts of the Kingdom, as had all∣ready put themselves into a Posture of defence against the common danger, had done nothing but what was justifiable, and was approved by both Houses.</Q> And having caused these, and such other Resolutions to be immediately published in print, that their friends abroad might know what they had to do, they sent a Committee of both Houses to the King at <HI>Theobalds</HI> with another Petition; in which they told him, <Q>“”that<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Petition of both Houses to the King at <HI>Theobalds.</HI></NOTE> their just apprehensions of sorrow and fear, in respect of the publick <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> dangers and miseries like to fall upon his Majesty and the Kingdom, were much increased upon the receipt of his unexpected denial of their most Humble and Necessary Petition concerning the Militia of the Kingdom; and that they were especially grieved, that wicked and mis∣chievous Counsellors should still have that power with him, as in that time, of approaching and imminent Ruin, he should rather incline to that, which was apt to further the accomplishment of the desires of the most malignant Enemies of Gods true Religion, and of the Peace and Safety of himself, and his Kingdom, than to the dutiful and faithful Counsel of his Parliament. Wherefore, they said, they were inforced in <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> all Humility to protest, that, if his Majesty should persist in that denial, the dangers and distempers of the Kingdom were such, as would endure no longer delay: but unless he should be graciously pleased to assure them by those Messengers, that he would speedily apply his Royal assent to the satisfaction of their former desires, they should be inforced, for the safety of his Majesty and his Kingdoms, to dispose of the Militia by the Authority of both Houses, in such a manner as had been pro∣pounded to him;</Q> and they resolved to do it accordingly.</P>
<P><Q>“”THEY likewise most Humbly besought his Majesty to believe, that the dangerous and desperate design upon the House of Commons, men∣tioned <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> in their Preamble, was not inserted with any intention to cast the least aspersion upon his Majesty; but therein they reflected upon that Malignant Party, of whose bloody and malicious practices they had so often experience, and from which they could never be secure, unless his Majesty would be pleased to put from him those wicked and unfaithful Counsellors, who interposed their own corrupt and malicious designs betwixt his Majesty's goodness and wisdom, and the prosperity and contentment of himself, and of his People: And that for the dispatch of the great affairs of the Kingdom, the safety of his Person, the protection and comfort of his Subjects, he would be pleased to con∣tinue <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> his abode near to <HI>London,</HI> and the Parliament; and not to with∣draw himself to any the remoter parts, which if he should do, must needs be a cause of great danger and distraction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THAT he would likewise be graciously pleased to continue the
<PB N="344" REF="3640"/>
Prince's Highness in those parts at S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>James</HI>'s, or any other of his Houses near <HI>London;</HI> whereby the designs, which the Enemies of the Religion, and Peace of the Kingdom might have upon his Person, and the Jealousies and Fears of his People might be prevented.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND they besought him to be informed by them, that, by the Laws of the Kingdom, the power of raising, ordering, and disposing of the Mi∣litia within any City, Town, or other place, could not be granted to any Corporation by Charter, or otherwise, without the Authority and Consent of Parliament: And that those parts of the Kingdom, which had put themselves in a posture of defence against the Common danger <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> had therein done nothing but according to the Declaration and Di∣rection of both Houses, and what was justifiable by the Laws of the Kingdom. All which their most humble counsel and desires they pray∣ed him to accept, as the effect of that duty and Allegiance, which they owed unto him, and which would not suffer them to admit of any thoughts, intentions, or endeavours, but such as were necessary and ad∣vantageous for his greatness, and honour, and the safety and prosperity of the Kingdom, according to that Trust and Power which the Laws had reposed in them.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</NOTE> AS SOON as the Petition was read, the King told them, that presented <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> it, <Q>“”that he was so much amazed at their M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siage, that he knew not what to Answer. He said, they spoke of Jealousies, and Fears, but he desired them to lay their hands to their hearts, and ask themselves, whether He might not likewise be disturbed with Fears and Jealousies? and if so, he assured them, that Message had nothing lessened them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Militia, he said, he had thought so much of it before he sent his Answer, and was so well assured that the Answer was agree∣able to what, in justice or reason, They could ask, or He in honour grant, that he should not alter it in any point.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR his residence near them, he said, he wished it might be so safe <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and honourable,</Q> that he had no cause to absent himself from <HI>White-Hall:</HI> he bid them ask themselves, whether he had not? For his Son, <Q>“”he said, he should take that care of him, which should justify him to God, as a Father; and to his Dominions, as a King. To conclude, he assured them upon his honour, that he had no thought but of Peace, and Justice to his People; which he would by all fair means seek to preserve and maintain, relying upon the goodness and providence of God for the preservation of himself, and his Rights.</Q></P>
<P>THIS, being suddainly, and with more than usual quickness spoken by the King, much appaled them; but they were too far ingaged to retire; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and therefore, assoon as it was reported to the Houses, they resolved, upon<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> debate, <Q>“”that the Kingdom should be forthwith put into a posture of de∣fence, by authority of both Houses, in such a way as had been formerly agreed upon by both Houses; and that a Declaration should be speedily sent unto the King, containing the causes of their just Fears and Jealou∣sies, and to make it evident that any, that were entertained against Them were groundless; Ordering at the same time, "that all the Lords Lieutenants of any Counties in <HI>England,</HI> who had been formerly so con∣stituted by the King by his Commissions under the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> should immediately bring in those Commissions to be cancelled as ille∣gal.</Q> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Allbeit some such Commissions had been granted, upon their own desire, since the beginning of the Parliament, as particularly to the Earl of <HI>Ess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be Lord Lieutenant of <HI>York-shire,</HI> and to the Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> for <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rset shire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="3650"/>
THEN both Houses sent to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> being High<NOTE PLACE="marg">They <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end to the Earl of <HI>Northumber∣land</HI> to pro¦vide a Fleet.</NOTE> Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> <Q>“”that they had received advertisement of extra∣ordinary preparations made, by the neighbouring Princes, both by Land and Sea; by which an apprehension was raised in both Houses, that the publick Honour, Peace, and Safety of his Majesty, and his Kingdom, could not be secured, unless a timely course was taken for the putting the Kingdom into a condition of defence at Sea, as well as at Land: and they did therefore Order him forthwith to give effectual direction that all the Ships belonging to his Majesty's Navy, and fit for Service, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and not allready abroad, or designed for the Summers Fleet, should be rigged, and put in such a readiness, as that they might be soon fitted for the Sea: and that his Lordship would also make known to the Masters, and Owners of other Ships, in any of the Harbours of the Kingdom, as might be of use for the Publick defence, that it would be an acceptable service to the King and Parliament, if They would likewise cause their Ship to be rigged, and so far put into a readiness, as they might, at a short warning, likewise be set to Sea upon any emer∣gent occasion; which would be a means of great security to his Ma∣jesty and his Dominions.</Q> To which the Earl returned an Answer <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> full of submission and obedience.</P>
<P>I HAVE been assured from persons of very good Credit, and conver∣sant with those Councils, that they had in deliberation and debate to send, and take the Prince from his Father at <HI>Theobalds</HI> by force; but that design was quickly laid aside, when they heard that the King was removed from thence to <HI>New-Market,</HI> and was like to make a further progress. So they used all possible expedition in preparing their Decla∣ration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Decla∣ration to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Majesty</NOTE> which they directed to his Majesty, and in which they told him, <Q>“”that alltho' that Answer, he had given to their Petition at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> did give just cause of sorrow to them; yet it was not without some <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> mixture of Confidence and Hope, considering those expressions pro∣ceeded from the misapprehensions of their Actions and Intentions; which, having no ground of truth or reality, might, by his justice and wisdom, be removed, when he should be fully informed, that those Fears and Jealousies of theirs, which his Majesty thought to be cause∣less, and without any just ground, did necessarily and clearly arise from those dangers and distempers, into which the mischievous and evil Councils about him had brought the Kingdom. And that those Other Fears and Jealousies, by which his Favour, his Royal Presence, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Confidence, had been withdrawn from his Parliament, had no foun∣dation, or subsistence in any action, intention, or miscarriage of Theirs; but were merely grounded upon the falshood and malice of those who, for the supporting and fomenting their own wicked designs against the Religion, and Peace of the Kingdom, did seek to deprive his Majesty of the strength, and the affection of his People; and Them of his Grace and Protection; and thereby, to subject both his Person, and the whole Kingdom, to ruin and destruction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THAT to satisfy his Majesty's judgment and conscience in both those points, they desired to make a free, and clear Declaration of the causes of their Fears and Jealousies, in some particulars.</Q></P>
<P N="1"><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> 1. <Q>“”THAT the design of altering Religion, in this and his other Kingdoms, had been potently carried on, by those in greatest Au∣thority about him, for divers years together: and that the Queen's Agent at <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Popes Agent, or Nuntio, Here, were not
<PB N="346" REF="3660"/>
only evidences of that design, but had been great Actors in it.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>“”THAT the War with <HI>Scotland</HI> was procured to make way for that intent, and chiefly fomented by the Papists, and others Popishly affect∣ed, whereof they had many evidences, especially their free and gene∣ral contribution to it.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>“”THAT the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland</HI> was framed, and contrived, here in <HI>England;</HI> and that the English Papists, should have risen about the same time, they had several testimonies and advertisements from <HI>Ire∣land;</HI> and that it was a common Speech amongst the Rebels (with which, they said, other evidences did concur, as the information of a <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Minister who came out of <HI>Ireland;</HI> the Letter of one <HI>Tristram Whet∣comb</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> to his Brother in <HI>England,</HI> and many others) that they would recover unto his Majesty his Royal Prerogative, wrested from him by the Puritan faction in the Houses of Parliament in <HI>England;</HI> and would maintain Episcopal jurisdiction, and the lawfulness thereof; which, they said, were the two quarrels, upon which his late Army in the North should have been incensed against them.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. <Q>“”THE cause they had to doubt that the late design, styled the Queen's pious intention, was for the alteration of Religion in this King∣dom, for success whereof the Popes Nuntio (the Count <HI>Rozetti)</HI> in∣joined <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> fasting and praying to be observed every week by the English Papists; which, they said, appeared to them by one of the original Letters directed by him to a Priest in <HI>Lancashire.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="5">5. <Q>“”THE boldness of the Irish Rebels in affirming they do nothing but by Authority from the King; that they call themselves the Queen's Army; that the prey and booty they take from the English, they mark with the Queen's mark; that their purpose was to come into <HI>England,</HI> when their business was done in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and sundry other things of that kind, which, they said, were proved by one <HI>Oconelly,</HI> and others; but especially in the forementioned Letter from <HI>Tristram Whetcomb,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> wherein there was this passage, that many other Speeches they utter, concerning Religion, and our Court of <HI>England,</HI> which he dares not commit to paper.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6. <Q>“”THE many attempts to provoke his late Army, and the Army of the Scots, and to raise a Faction in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and other parts of the Kingdom. That those who had been Actors in these businesses, had their dependence, their countenance, and incourage∣ment, from the Court; witness the Treason, whereof M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jermyn,</HI> and others, stood accused; who they said, was transported beyond Seas by Warrant under his Majesty's own hand, after he had given assurance <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to his Parliament, that he had laid a strict command upon his Ser∣vants, that none of them should depart from Court. And that dan∣gerous Petition delivered to Captain <HI>Leg</HI> by his Majesty's own hand, accompanied with a direction Signed with C. R.</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. <Q>“”THE false and scandalous accusation against the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the five Members of the House of Commons▪ tender'd to the Par∣liament by his own Command, and endeavoured to be justified in the City by his own presence and perswasion, and to be put in execution upon their persons by his demand of them in the House of Commons, in so terrible and violent a manner, as far exceeded all former breaches <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of Priviledges of Parliament acted by his Majesty, or any of his Pre∣decessors: and they said, whatever his own intentions were, divers bloody and desperate persons, that attended him, discovered their af∣fections,
<PB N="347" REF="3670"/>
and resolutions, to have massacre'd and destroyed the Mem∣bers of that House, if the absence of those persons accused had not, by God's providence, stopp'd the giving that <HI>word,</HI> which they expected for the setting them upon that barbarous and bloody Act: The listing of Officers, and Soldiers, for a Guard at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and such other particulars.</Q></P>
<P N="8">8. <Q>“”THAT, after a Vote had passed in the House of Commons, declar∣ing that the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> had appeared in a Warlike manner at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> to the terrour and affright of his Majesty's good Subjects, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and disturbance of the publick Peace of the Kingdom, he should ne∣vertheless be in that credit with his Majesty, as to be sent away by his Majesty's own Warrant to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>J. Pennington</HI> to land him beyond Seas; from whence he vented his own Trayterous conceptions, that his Majesty should declare himself, and retire to a place of strength; as if he could not be safe amongst his People. Which false and malicious counsel, and advice, they said, they had great cause to doubt, made too deep an impression upon his Majesty, considering the course he was pleased to take of absenting himself from his Parliament, and carrying the Prince with him; which seemed to express a purpose in his Ma∣jesty <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to keep himself in a readiness for the acting of it.</Q></P>
<P N="9">9. <Q>“”THE many advertisements they had from <HI>Rome, Paris, Venice,</HI> and other parts, that they still expected, that his Majesty had some great design in hand, for the altering of Religion, and the breaking the neck of his Parliament. That the Popes Nuntio had sollicited the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> to lend his Majesty four thousand men apiece, to help to maintain his Royalty against the Parliament. And, they said, as that Forreign Force was the most pernicious, and ma∣lignant design of all the rest; so they hoped it was, and should allways <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> be, farthest from his Majesty's thoughts; because no man would be∣lieve he would give up his People, and Kingdom, to be spoil'd by strangers, if he did not likewise intend to change both his own profes∣sion in Religion, and the Publick profession of the Kingdom, that so he might be still more assured of those Forreign States of the Popish Religion for their future support, and defence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THESE, they said, were some of the grounds of their Fears and Jealousies, which had made them so earnestly implore his Royal Au∣thority, and Protection, for their defence and security, in all the ways of Humility and Submission; which being denied by his Majesty, se∣duced <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> by evil Counsel, they did, with sorrow for the great and un∣avoidable misery and danger, which was thereby like to fall upon his own person, and his Kingdoms, apply themselves to the use of that power for the security and defence of both, which, by the fundamental Laws and Constitutions of the Kingdom, resided in them; yet still resolving to keep themselves within the bounds of faithfulness, and alle∣giance to his Sacred Person, and Crown.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”TO the Fears and Jealousies expressed by his Majesty, when he said, that for his residence near the Parliament, he wished it might be so safe and honourable, that he had no cause to absent himself from <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <HI>White-Hall:</HI> That, they said, they took as the greatest breach of Pri∣viledge, that could be offer'd; as the heaviest misery to Himself, and imputation upon Them, that could be imagined, and the most mis∣chievous effect of evil Counsels; it rooted up the strongest Foundation of the safety and honour, the Crown afforded; it seemed as much as
<PB N="348" REF="3680"/>
be, they said, to cast upon the Parliament such a Charge, as was inconsistent with the nature of that great Council, being the Body, of which his Majesty was the Head; it struck at the very Being both of the King and Parliament, depriving his Majesty, in his own apprehen∣sion, of Their fidelity, and Them of His Protection; which are the natural bonds and supports of Government, and Subjection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they had, according to his Majesty's desire, laid their hands upon their hearts; they had asked themselves in the strictest exa∣mination of their Consciences; they had searched their affections, their thoughts, considered their actions; and they found none, that could <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> give his Majesty any just occasion to absent himself from <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and his Parliament; but that he might, with more honour and safety, continue There, than in any other place. They said, his Majesty laid a General tax upon them: if he would be graciously pleased to let them know the Particulars, they should give a clear, and satisfactory An∣swer. But, they said, they could have no hope of ever giving his Ma∣jesty satisfaction, when those Particulars, which he had been made believe were true, yet, being produced▪ and made known to them, ap∣peared to be false; and his Majesty notwithstanding would neither punish, nor produce the Authors, but go on to contract New fears and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> jealousies, upon General and Uncertain grounds; affording them no means, or possibility of Particular Answer to the clearing of themselves, of which they gave him these Instances. 1. The Speeches pretended to be spoken at <HI>Kensington</HI> concerning the Queen, which had been de∣nied and disavowed; yet his Majesty had not named the Authors. 2. The Charge and Accusation of the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the five Members, who refused no Tryal or Examination, which might stand with the Priviledges of Parliament; yet no Authors, no Witnesses, were produced, against whom they might have reparation for the great injury, and infamy cast upon them. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY besought his Majesty to consider in what State he was, how easy and fair a way he had to happiness, honour, greatness, and plenty, and security, if he would joyn with his Parliament, and his faithful Subjects, in the defence of the Religion, and the publick good of the Kingdom. That, they said, was all they expected from him, and for that, they would return to him their lives, fortunes, and utmost en∣deavours to support his Majesty, his just soveraignty, and power over them. But, they said, it was not Words, that could secure them in those their Humble desires; they could not but too well and sorrow∣fully remember, what gracious Messages they had from him the last <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Summer; when, with His privity, the bringing up of the Army was in agitation: They could not but with the like affections recall to their minds, how, not two days before he gave direction for the aforemen∣tioned Accusation, and his own Coming to the Commons House, that House received from him a Gracious Message, that he would allways have care of Their Priviledges, as of his own Prerogative; and of the safety of Their Persons, as of his own Children.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, that which they expected, and which would give them assurance that he had no thought but of Peace, and Justice to his Peo∣ple, must be some Real effect of his goodness to them, in granting <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> thosethings, which the present necessity of the Kingdom did inforce them to desire. And in the first place, that he would be graciously pleased to put from him those wicked, and mischievous Counsellors,
<PB N="349" REF="3690"/>
which had caused all those dangers, and distractions; and to continue his own residence, and the Prince's, near <HI>London,</HI> and the Parliament; which, they hoped, would be a happy beginning of contentment, and Confidence between him and his people; and be followed with many succeeding blessings of Honour and Greatness to his Majesty, and of security and prosperity to Them.</Q></P>
<P>IN the debate of this Declaration, the like whereof had never before been heard of in Parliament, in which they took his Majesty's doubt of his safety at <HI>White-Hall</HI> so heavily, that, they said, <Q>“”it seemed to cast such <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> a charge upon the Parliament, as was inconsistent with the na∣ture of that great Council (so apprehensive they were of the least suspition of want of freedom) the Prevalent Party carried themselves with that pride,</Q> and impetuosity, that they would endure no opposition or dispute▪ insomuch as S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> (who indeed was very grievous to them for not complying with them) for objecting against some sharp expressions in the Declaration (before it passed the House, and when the Question was, whether it should pass) as being too distant from that reverence, which ought to be used to the King; and for saying, upon a Clause, in which they mentioned their General Intelligence from <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Rome, Venice▪ `Paris,</HI> and other places, of some design the King had upon Religion, and the Parliament, from whence they seemed to con∣clude that the King would change his Religion, <Q>“”That they seemed to ground an opinion of the King's Apostacy upon a less evidence, than would serve to hang a fellow for stealing a Horse,</Q> was committed to the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> <Q>“”for laying an imputation upon that Committee, which had drawn up the Declaration.</Q> Notwithstanding which, after they had imprisoned him, they thought fit to make That expression less gross, and positive; tho' as it is set down above (in which words it passed, and was delivered to the King) it was thought by standers by <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to be very unagreeable to the Gravity of a wise Court, and to the Duty of Subjects.</P>
<P>BuT in this particular, in oppressing all those, who were of diffe∣rent opinions from them, their carriage was so notorious and terrible, that Spies were set upon, and inquiries made upon all private, light, casual discourses, which fell from those who were not Gracious to them: As M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Trelawny,</HI> a Member of the House of Commons, and a Merchant of great reputation, was expelled the House, and committed to Prison, for having said, in a Private discourse in the City, to a Friend, <Q>“”that the House could not appoint a Guard for themselves with∣out <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the King's consent,</Q> under pain of High-Treason: Which was proved by a fellow, who pretended to overhear him; when the person himself, with whom the conference was held, declared, <Q>“”that he said, it Might be imputed to them for High Treason:</Q> and it was confessed on all parts, that the words were spoken long before the discovery, and some days before the House had Resolved, <Q>“”that they would have a Guard.</Q> And afterwards, upon the old stock of their dislike, when the War begun to break out, they again imprisoned this honest Gen∣tleman; seized upon all his Estate, which was very good; and suffer'd him to dye in Prison for want of ordinary relief, and refreshment.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> AND in this very time, we speak of, and in the very business of the Militia, when every day very great multitudes of Petitions from most of the Counties of <HI>England,</HI> and from the City of <HI>London,</HI> were presented to both Houses, to desire they might be put into a posture
<PB N="350" REF="3700"/>
of defence; and that they would cause the Ordinance for the Militia to be speedily executed, which was alledged to be an instance of the people's desire throughout the Kingdom, and the chief ground of their proceeding; the most substantial Citizens of <HI>London</HI> both in reputa∣tion, and Estate, finding that the Militia of that City, with which by their Charter, and Constant Practice, the Lord Mayor had been all∣ways intrusted, was now with a most extravagant power to be com∣mitted to a number of Factious persons of the City, part of whom con∣sisted of men of no fortune, or reputation, resolved to Petition both Houses "not to alter the original constitution, and right of their City: <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and, to that purpose, a Petition was signed by some hundreds, and very probably would in few days have been subscribed by all, or most of the substantial Citizens of <HI>London.</HI> The House had notice of this Petition, which they called another Conspiracy and Plot against the Parliament, and immediately imployed a Member of their own to pro∣cure a sight of it; who, under a trust of redelivering it, got it into his hands, and brought it to the House of Commons; upon which, some principal Citizens, who had subscribed it, were examined, and committed to Prison; and a direction given, that a Charge and Im∣peachment should be prepared against the Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> who, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> they heard, had been of Council in the drawing up, and preparing that Petition, and they knew, was opposite to their Tumultuary proceed∣ings. So when the chief Gentlemen of <HI>Oxford-shire</HI> heard, that a Pe∣tition had been delivered to the House of Commons in their Name, and the name of that County, against the established Government of the Church, and for the exercise of the Militia, they assembled toge∣ther to draw up a Petition disavowing the former, and to desire, <Q>“”that the setled Laws might be observed;</Q> of which the Lord <HI>Say</HI> having notice, he procured the chief Gentlemen to be sent for as Delinquents, and so suppressed that Address: And this was the measure of their <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Justice in many other particulars of the same nature, receiving and cherishing all mutinous, and seditious Petitions, and discountenancing such as besought the continuance, and vindication, of the so long cele∣brated and happy Government in Church, and State; the prime leaders of that Faction not blushing, in publick debates in the House, <Q>to aver “”that no man ought to Petition for the Government established by Law, because he had allready his Wish; but they that desired an Alteration, could not otherwise have their desires known; and therefore were to be countenanced.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They L kewise present the King with Reasons for his conti∣nuance near the Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> THE Committee, which presented the Declaration to the King at <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> <HI>New-Market,</HI> presented likewise additional reasons, as they called them, for his Majesty's return, and continuance near the Parliament; as a matter, in their apprehension, of so great necessity, and importance towards the preservation of his Person, and his Kingdom: and they said,</P>
<P><Q>“”THEY could not think they discharged their duties in the single expression of their desire, unless they added some further reasons to back it with. 1. His Majesty's absence would cause men to believe, that it was out of design to discourage the undertakers, and hinder the other provisions for raising money for defence of <HI>Ireland.</HI> 2. It <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> would very much hearten the Rebels There, and disaffected persons in This Kingdom, as being an evidence, and effect of the Jealousy and Division between his Majesty, and his people, 3. That it would
<PB N="351" REF="3710"/>
much weaken, and withdraw the Affection of the Subject from his Majesty; without which, a Prince is deprived of his chiefest strength, and lustre, and left naked to the greatest dangers and miseries, that can be imagined. 4. That it would invite, and incourage the Ene∣mies of our Religion and the State in forreign parts, to the attempt∣ing, and acting of their evil designs, and intentions towards us. 5. That it did cause a great interruption in the proceedings of Par∣liament. Those considerations, they said, threaten'd so great dangers to his Person, and to all his Dominions, that, as his Great Council, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> they held it necessary to represent to him this their faithful Advice, that so, whatsoever should follow, They might be excused before God, and Man.</Q></P>
<P>WHILST that Declaration was reading, his Majesty expressed some passion upon particular expressions; and once, when that passage was read, that takes notice <Q>“”of the transportation of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jermyn</HI> by his Ma∣jesty's own Warrant, after he had given his word, that he had com∣manded that none of his Servants should depart from Court,</Q> inter∣rupted the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who read it, and said, "that's False; and when he was told, <Q>“”it related not to the Date, but the Execution of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the Warrant, his Majesty said, "It might have been better expressed then:</Q> It is a high thing to tax a King with breach of Promise. But after both the Declarations, and Reasons were read, the King, after a<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty's Answer to both.</NOTE> short pause, said to them:</P>
<P><Q>“”I AM confident that you expect not I should give you a speedy Answer to this strange, and unexpected Declaration; and I am sorry, in the distraction of this Kingdom, you should think This way of Ad∣dress to be more convenient, than That propounded, by my Message of the twentieth of <HI>January</HI> last, to both Houses. As concerning the grounds of your Fears and Jealousies, I will take time to Answer <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> them particularly; and doubt not but I shall do it to the satisfaction of all the world. God in His good time will, I hope, discover the secrets and bottoms of all Plots, and Treasons; and Then I shall stand right in the eys of all my People. In the mean time I must tell you, that I rather expected a vindication for the imputation laid upon me in M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI>'s Speech, than that any more General rumors, and discourses, should get credit with you. For My Fears and Doubts, I did not think they should have been thought so trivial and ground∣less, whilst so many seditious Pamphlets, and Sermons, are looked upon, and so great Tumults remember'd, unpunished, and uninquired <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> into. I still confess my Fears, and call God to witness, that they are greater for the true Protestant profession, my People and Laws, than for my own rights, or safety; tho' I must tell you, I conceive none of these are free from danger. What would you have? Have I vio∣lated your Laws? Have I denied to pass any one Bill for the ease, and security of my Subjects? I do not ask you what You have done for Me. Are my People transported with Fears and Apprehensions? I have offer'd as free, and general a Pardon as your selves can de∣vise. There is a Judgment from Heaven upon this Nation, if these distractions continue. God so deal with Me, and Mine, as all my <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> thoughts, and intentions, are upright for the maintainance of the true Protestant profession, and for the observation and preservation of the Laws of the Land: and I hope God will bless, and assist those Laws for my preservation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="$2" REF="3720"/>
THIS being suddainly, and with some vehemence, spoken by his Majesty, and he having taken further time to Answer the Declaration, and the Reasons, the Committee besought him, <Q>“”since they were to carry back with them no other Answer, that his Majesty would vouch∣safe to give them what he had spoken,</Q> in writing; which, the next morning, he did: And then the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> again desired him, "that he would reside nearer his Parliament; whereunto the King briefly Answered, <Q>“”I would you had given me cause; but I am sure this Declaration is not the way to it.</Q> Then being asked by the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> whether the Militia might not be granted, as was desired <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> by the Parliament, for a time? He Answered, <Q>“”By God not for an hour. You have asked that of me in this, was never asked of a King, and with which I will not trust my Wife, and Children. He told them, he could not have believed the Parliament would have sent him such a Declaration, if he had not seen it brought by such persons: and said he was Sorry for the Parliament, but Glad he had it; for by that he doubted not to satisfy his People. He said they spoke of ill Councils; but he was confident They had worse Information, than He had Councils. He told them, the business of <HI>Ireland</HI> would ne∣ver be done in the way they were in, four hundred would never do <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that work; it must be put into the hands of One: and, he said, if He were trusted with it, he would pawn his Head to end that work.</Q></P>
<P>ASSOON as the Committee returned and reported, what Answer they had received, and in what disposition and temper they found, and left the King; it was Order'd, that their Declaration, which they had sent to him, should be speedily printed, and carefully dispersed through∣out the Kingdom, that the People might see upon what terms they stood; and all other possible courses were taken to poyson the hearts, and affections of the Subjects, and to suppress all those, who, in any de∣gree, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> seemed to dislike their high proceedings. Above all, care was taken to place such Preachers, and Lecturers, in the most populous Towns and Parishes, as were well known to Abhor the present Government, and temperature of Church and State; many of whom were recom∣mended, and positively injoined, and imposed upon Parishes, by the House of Commons; and others, by such Factious Members, whose re∣putation was most current: and all Canonical Clergy-men, and Ortho∣dox Divines, were, with equal industry, discountenanced, imprisoned, or forced to a long attendance upon Committees, or the House (which was worse than Imprisonment) under the notion and imputation of Scan∣dalous <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Ministers. Which charge and reproach reached all men, whose Inclinations they liked not, or whose Opinions they suspected. And that they might be sure to be as strong and absolute at Sea, as at Land, they appointed the Lord Admiral to send the Names of all those Captains of Ships, who were to attend the Fleet for that Summer Service, to them, to the end they might have such men, in whom they might Confide; which his Lordship most punctually observed. By which they helped to free him of those Officers whom he could not plausibly have dis∣charged; and struck out the names of those, whose Affections, or Rela∣tions they thought themselves not secure in. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>

<PB N="353" REF="3730"/>
willing to attend him; and to the end that there might be publick notice of it, he sent from <HI>Huntington,</HI> when he was upon his Journey, a Message to both Houses: <Q>“”That, being then in his remove to his City of <HI>York,</HI> where he intended to make his residence for some time, he thought fit to send that Message to them, and very earnestly to de∣sire them, that they would use all possible industry in expediting the business of <HI>Ireland;</HI> in which they should find so chearful a con∣currence from his Majesty, that no inconvenience should happen to that Service by his absence, he having all that passion for the re∣ducing <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> that Kingdom, which he had expressed in his former Messages, and being, by Words, unable to manifest more affection to it, than he had endeavoured to do by those Messages: having likewise done all such Acts, as he had been moved unto by his Parliament. Therefore, if the misfortunes and calamities of his poor Protestant Subjects there should grow upon them (tho' he should be deeply concerned in, and sensible of their sufferings) he said, he should wash his hands before theworld from the least imputation of slackness in that most necessary, and pious work.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND, that he might leave no way unattempted, which might be∣get <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> a good understanding between him and his Parliament, he said, he thought it necessary to declare, that, as He had been so tender of the Priviledges of Parliament, that he had been ready and for∣ward to retract any Act of his own, which he had been informed had trenched upon Their Priviledges; so he expected an equal tender∣ness in Them of His known Prerogatives, which, are the unquestion∣able Priviledges of the Kingdom; amongst which he was assured, it was a Fundamental one, that his Subjects could not be obliged to obey any Act, Order, or Injunction, to which He had not given his Consent.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”AND therefore, he thought it necessary to publish, that he expected, and thereby required, obedience from all his loving Subjects to the Laws established; and that they presumed not upon any pretence of Order, or Ordinance, to which his Majesty was no Party, concerning the Militia, or any other thing, to do, or execute what was not war∣rantable by those Laws; he being resolved to keep the Laws Him∣self,</Q> and to require obedience to them from all his Subjects.</P>
<P><Q>“”HE once more recommended unto them the substance of his Message of the twentieth of <HI>January</HI> last; that they would compose, and di∣gest with all speed, such Acts as they should think fit for the present, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and future establishment of their Priviledges, the free and quiet in∣joying their Estates and fortunes, the liberties of their persons, the security of the true Religion Then professed in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the maintaining his Regal and Just Authority, and setling his Re∣venue; he being most desirous to take all fitting and just ways, which might beget a happy understanding between him and his Parliament, in which he conceived his greatest Power,</Q> and Riches did consist.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Houses Votes concern∣ing the Mi∣litia.</NOTE> I HAVE not known both Houses in more choler and rage, than upon the receiving this Message, which came early to them on <HI>Wednesday</HI> the sixteenth of <HI>March.</HI> Now the day before had been spent in pre∣paring <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> all things ready for the execution of the Ordinance of the Mi∣litia; They had Voted, and Resolved, <Q>“”that it was not any way against the Oath of Allegiance, that all the Commissions to Leiutenants un∣der the great Seal were Illegal, and Void; and that whosoever should
<PB N="354" REF="3740"/>
execute any power over the Militia by colour of any Commission of Lieutenancy, without consent of both Houses of Parliament, should be accounted a disturber of the Peace of the Kingdom.</Q> Then they agreed upon this Proposition, <Q>“”that the Kingdom Had been of late, and Still was, in so evident and imminent danger, both from Enemies abroad, and a Popish and discontented Party at home, that there was an urgent, and inevitable necessity of putting his Majesty's Subjects into a posture of defence, for the safeguard both of the King, and his People; and that the Lords and Commons, apprehending that danger, and being sensible of their own duty to provide a suitable prevention, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> had, in several Petitions, addressed themselves to his Majesty's for the ordering, and disposing the Militia of the Kingdom in such a way, as was agreed upon, by the wisdom of both Houses, to be most proper for the present exigence of the Kingdom: Yet they could not obtain it; but his Majesty did several times refuse to give his Royal assent thereunto. Upon this Proposition, they Resolved, "that in that case of extreme danger, and of his Majesty▪s refusal, the Ordinance agreed on by both Houses for the Militia did oblige the people, and ought to be obeyed, by the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom; and that such persons as should be Nominated Deputy Lieutenants, and ap∣proved <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of by both Houses, should receive the commands of both Houses,</Q> to take upon them to execute their Offices. All which Re∣solutions were order'd, the same night, to be printed and published. So that, when the King's Message from <HI>Huntington</HI> was read the next morning, and seemed to be against their Votes of the day before, they concluded, <Q>“”that it could not be sent from the King, but that it had been inserted in blanks left in the Town for such purposes;</Q> and im∣mediately made a Committee, <Q>“”to find out by whom that Message was framed.</Q> But when they remember'd, that they had Voted as much a week before, and had examined the Gentlemen who brought it, and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> had received it from the King's own hand, they proceeded no further in that inquisition; but satisfied themselves with a new Vote, <Q>“”that those Persons, who advised his Majesty to absent himself from the Parliament, and those that advised him to that Message, were Ene∣mies to the Peace of the Kingdom, and justly to be suspected to be favourers of the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland.</HI></Q> And for the matter it self they resolved to insist upon their former Votes; and withall declared, <Q>“”that when the Lords and Commons in Parliament, which is the supreme Court of Judicature in the Kingdom, should declare what the Law of the Land is, to have that not only questioned, and controverted, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> but Contradicted, and a Command that it should Not be obeyed, was a high breach of the Priviledge of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>AND this likewise they caused to be speedily printed; lest the King should be able to perswade the Subjects, that an Order of theirs, with∣out His consent, was no Law to compel their obedience. And from this last Resolution, by which the Law of the Land, and consequently the liberty of the Subject, was resolved into a Vote of the two Houses, which passed without any dispute or hesitation, all Sober men discerned the fatal period of both, and saw a Foundation laid for all the Anarchy and Confusion, that hath followed. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Order concerning <HI>Hull.</HI></NOTE> IT was now known, that the King was gone to <HI>York,</HI> which made them apprehend their Principality of <HI>Hull</HI> might be in danger; and therefore they immediately Resolve, <Q>“”that no Forces whatsoever shall
<PB N="355" REF="3750"/>
be admitted in that Town, without the Immediate consent of both Houses:</Q> which Order was sent thither by an express. And having prepared the People to be ready for the Militia, by publishing <Q>“”that, in case of Extreme danger,</Q> they were to obey that Ordinance; they were, in the next place, to find the danger to be Extreme; and, to that purpose, they produced Letters without any name, pretended to be written from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> signifying, <Q>“”that they had intelligence there, that there was an Army ready in <HI>Denmark</HI> to be transported into <HI>England,</HI> and was to be landed at <HI>Hull;</HI> which they said, had been <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> confirmed to them, by a person of reputation, from <HI>New-Market,</HI> who confirmed the Intelligence of <HI>Denmark:</HI> and added, that there were likewise forces ready in <HI>France</HI> to be landed at <HI>Hull.</HI></Q></P>
<P>OF this, how gross and ridiculous soever it appeared to wise men, they made a double use (besides the general impression in the People) the one to colour and countenance their Orders to their Governour there; the other, to make the King's residence in those parts suspected and grievous, as if he came thither only to bring in forreign forces upon them. With these Alarms of forreign forces, they mingled other In∣telligence of the Papists in <HI>England,</HI> <Q>“”that they had a purpose of making <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> an Insurrection;</Q> and therefore they proceeded in preparing a Bill to secure the persons of those of the best quality, and greatest interest, and injoyning the Oath of Supremacy to be taken with great rigour; and, amongst other stratagems they had to humble the Papists, I remember, upon an information that they used their Protestant Tenants worse in the raising their Rents, than they did those of their own Religion, there was an Order, <Q>“”that they should not raise the Rents of their Tenants, above the rates that the Protestant Landlords adjoyning received from Their Tenants:</Q> by virtue of which, in some places, they undertook <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to determine what Rents their Tenants should pay to them. But, in this zeal against the Papists, they could not endure that the King should have any share; and therefore, when they found, that his Majesty had published a Proclamation in his Journey towards <HI>York,</HI> <Q>“”commanding all the Judges, and Justices of Peace, and other Officers, to put in due execution all the Laws, and Statutes of the Kingdom, against Popish Recusants,</Q> without favour or connivance, they presently sent for the Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> to the House of Commons, and examined them, <Q>“”why seven Priests, who were in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and had been long Condemned,</Q> were not Executed? the reason whereof they well knew; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and when the Sheriffs said, <Q>“”that they had received a Reprieve for them under the Kings hand,</Q> they published that with great care in their prints, to take off the credit of the new Proclamation; and appointed their Messengers, whom they were then sending to the King with a new Declaration, to move his Majesty, <Q>“”that he would take off his Re∣prieve, and suffer those seven condemn▪d Priests to be Executed, ac∣cording to the Judgments they had received.</Q></P>
<P>THEY proceeded now to provide all necessary means for the raising great sums of money, by the diligent collection of what was granted by former Acts, and by a new Bill for the raising of four hundred <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> thousand pounds, for the payment of the great debts of the Kingdom (by which they meant the remainder of the three hundred thousand pounds, they had bountifully given to their Brethren of <HI>Scotland)</HI> and the support of the War of <HI>Ireland:</HI> All which monies were to be re∣ceived, and disposed as the two Houses should direct; of which tho'
<PB N="356" REF="3760"/>
the King saw the danger, that might, and Did after ensue thereupon, yet he thought that probable inconvenience and mischief to be less, than that, which the scandal of denying any thing, upon which the recovery of <HI>Ireland</HI> seem'd to depend, would inevitably bring upon him; and so ratified whatsoever they brought to him of that Kind.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They make Prepositions for Adven∣turers in <HI>Ire∣land.</HI></NOTE> AMONGST other Expedients for raising of money for the War of <HI>Ireland,</HI> about this time, they made certain Propositions to incourage men to be Adventurers in that Traffick, Thus: They concluded <Q>“”that, in so general a Rebellion, very much land must Escheat to the Crown by the forfeiture of Treason, and that, out of such forfeitures, satis∣faction <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> might be given to those, who should disburse money towards the suppression of the Rebels; so many Acres of Land to be allowed for so much money, according to the value of the Lands in the se∣veral Provinces,</Q> which was specified in the Propositions; which, having passed both Houses, were presented to the King, who (it being about the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> when the breach of their Priviledges rung in all mens ears) Answered, <Q>“”that as he had offer▪d, and was still ready to venture, his own Person for the recovery of that Kingdom, if his Parliament should advise him thereunto; so he would not deny to contribute any other assistance he could to that Service, by parting <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> with any profit or advantage of his own there; and therefore, relying<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to them.</NOTE> upon the wisdom of his Parliament, he did consent to every Propo∣sition, now made to him, without taking time to consider, and exa∣mine, whether that course might not retard the reducing that King∣dom, by exasperating the Rebels, and rendering them desperate of be∣ing received into Grace, if they should return to their obedience. And, he said, he would be ready to give his Royal assent to such Bills, as should be tender▪d to him by his Parliament for the confirmation of those Propositions.</Q></P>
<P>WHICH Answer, together with their Propositions, they caused forth-with <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to be Printed; made their Committees, in all places, to sollicite Subscriptions, and to receive the monies, the Principal and most Active persons Subscribing first, for the example of others; and delayed the framing, and presenting the Bill to the King, till they had received great sums of money, and procured very many persons of all conditions to Subscribe, many coming in out of pure covetousness to raise great fortunes; five hundred Acres of Land being assigned for one hundred pound in some Counties, and not much under that proportion in others: some out of pure fear, and to win credit with the Powerful Party, which made this new project a measure of mens affections, and a tryal how <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> far they might be trusted, and relied on.</P>
<P>THEN they sent those Propositions digested into a Bill to the King, with such Clauses of power to Them, and diminution of his own, that, upon the matter, he put the making a Peace with the Rebels there out<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> of his power, tho' upon the most advantagious terms; which he was likewise necessitated to pass.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding all these preparations on This side the Sea, the relief, and provision was very slowly supplied to the Other side; where the Rebels still increased in strength, and, by the same of these Propositions, inlarged their power, very many persons of Honour, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> fortune, who till then had sate still, and either were, or seemed to be averse to the Rebellion, joining with them, as being desperate, and con∣ceiving the utter suppressing their Religion, and the very extirpation
<PB N="357" REF="3770"/>
of their Nation, to be decreed against them. And, without doubt, the great Reformers here were willing enough to drive them to any extre∣mity, both out of revenge and contempt, as a people easy to be rooted out, and that the War might be kept up still; since they feared an Union in That Kingdom might much prejudice their designs in This, both as it might supply the King with power, and take away much of Theirs; whereas Now they had opportunity, with reference to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to raise both men and money, which they might be able to imploy upon more pressing occasions, as they will be found afterwards to have <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> done. Neither was it out of their expectation and view, that, by the King's consenting to that severe Decree, he might very probably dis∣courage his Catholick Subjects, in his other Dominions, from any extra∣ordinary Acts of duty, and affection: at least, that it would render him less considered by most Catholick Princes. And they knew well what use to make of any diminution of his interest, or reputation. These matters thus setled, for the ease of the two Houses, who were now like to have much to do, they appointed the whole business of <HI>Ireland</HI> to be managed by Commission under the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> by four Lords and eight Commoners, whom they recommended to the King, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and who were allways to receive Instructions from Themselves. And in this state, and disposition, were the affairs of <HI>Ireland,</HI> when the King went to York, where let us now resort to him.</P>

<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>SSOON as the King came to <HI>Tork,</HI> which was about the end of the year 1641, and found his reception there to be equal to his expectation, the Gentry, and men of Ability of that great and populous County (some very few excepted) expressing great alacrity for his Majesty's being with them, and no less sense of the insolent proceedings of the Par∣liament; thereupon, he resolved to treat with the two Houses in an other manner than he had done, and to let them clearly know, <Q>“”that as he would deny them nothing that was fit for Them to Ask, so he would yield to nothing that was unreasonable for Him to Grant; and that he would have no∣thing extorted from him, that he was not very well inclined to con∣sent to.</Q> So, within few days after his coming thither, he sent them a Declaration (which he caused to be printed, and, in the Frontispiece, recommended to the consideration of all his loving Subjects) in An∣swer to that presented to him at <HI>New-Market</HI> some days before: He told them,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His Majesty; Declaration from</HI> York, Mar. 9. 1641.</NOTE> <Q>“”THAT, though that Declaration, presented to him at <HI>New-Market</HI> from both Houses of Parliament, was of so strange a Nature, in respect of what he expected (after so many Acts of grace and favour to his People) and some expressions in it so different from the usual Language to Princes, that he might well take a very long time to consider it; yet the clearness and uprightness of his conscience to God, and love to his Subjects, had supplied him with a speedy Answer; and his un∣alterable affection to his People prevailed with him to suppress that passion, which might well enough become him upon such invitation.
<PB N="362" REF="3800"/>
He said, he had reconsidered his Answer of the first of that Month at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> which was urged to have given just cause of sorrow to his Subjects; but, he said, whoever looked over that Message (which was in effect to tell him, that if he would not joyn with them in an Act, which he conceived might prove prejudicial and dangerous to him, and the whole Kingdom, they would make a Law without him, and impose it upon his People) would not think that suddain Answer could be excepted to. He said, he had little incouragement to replies of that Nature, when he was told of how little Value his words were like to be with them, though they came accompanied with all the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Actions of Love, and Justice (where there was room for Actions to accompany them) yet he could not but disavow the having any such evil Counsel, or Counsellors about him, to his knowledge, as were mentioned by them; and, if any such should be discovered, he would leave them to the censure, and judgment of his Parliament. In the mean time he could wish, that his own immediate Actions, which he did avow, and his own honour might not be so roughly censured and wounded, under that common style of evil Counsellors. For his faith∣full and zealous affection to the true Protestant profession, and his re∣solution to concur with his Parliament in any possible course for the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> propagation of It, and the suppression of Popery, He said he could say no more than he had allready expressed in his Declaration to all his loving Subjects, published in <HI>January</HI> last, by the advice of his Privy Council; in which he endeavour'd to make as lively a confession of himself in that point, as he was able, being most assured, that the constant practice of his life had been answerable thereunto: And there∣fore, he did rather expect a Testimony, and acknowledgment of such his Zeal and Piety, than those expressions he met with in that Decla∣ration of any design of altering Religion in this Kingdom. And he said, he did, out of the innocency of his Soul, wish, that the judg∣ments <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of Heaven might be manifested upon those, who have, or had any such designs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”As for the <HI>Scots</HI> Troubles, he told them, he had thought, that those unhappy differences had been wrapp'd up in perpetual silence by the Act of Oblivion; which, being solemnly passed in the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, stop'd his own Mouth from any other reply, than to shew his great dislike for reviving the Memory thereof. He said, if the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland,</HI> so odious to all Christians, seem'd to have been framed, and maintained in <HI>England,</HI> or to have any Countenance from hence, he conjured both his Houses of Parliament, and all his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> loving Subjects whatsoever, to use all possible means to discover, and find such out, that he might joyn in the most exemplary Vengeance upon them, that could be imagined. But, he told them, he must think himself highly, and causlessly injured in his reputation, if any Declaration, Acton, or Expression, of the Irish Rebels; any Letters from the Count <HI>Rozetti</HI> to the Papists, for Fasting and Praying; or from <HI>Tristram Whetcomb,</HI> of strange Speeches uttered in <HI>Ireland,</HI> should beget any Jealousy, or Misapprehension in his Subjects of his Justice, Piety, and Affection: it being evident to all understandings, that those mischievous and wicked Rebels, are not so capable of great <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> advantage, as by having their false discourses so far believed, as to raise Fears and Jealousies to the distraction of this Kingdom; the only way to their security. He said, he could not express a deeper sense
<PB N="363" REF="3810"/>
of the sufferings of his poor Protestant Subjects in that Kingdom, than he had done in his often Messages to both Houses; by which he had offer'd,</Q> and was still ready to venture his Royal Person for their re∣demption, well knowing that as he was, in his own Interests, <Q>more “”concerned in them; so he was to make a strict Account to Allmighty God for any neglect of His Duty,</Q> or their Preservation.</P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the manifold Attempts to provoke his late Army, and the Army of the Scots, and to raise a Faction in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and other parts of the Kingdom, if it were said as relating to Him, he could <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> not without great Indignation, suffer himself to be reproached to have intended the least force, or threatning to his Parliament; as the be∣ing Privy to the bringing up the Army would imply. Whereas, he called God to Witness, he never had any such thought, nor knew of any such resolution concerning his late Army. For the Petition shewed to him by Captain <HI>Leg,</HI> he said, he well remember'd the same, and the occasion of that conference. Captain <HI>Leg</HI> being lately come out of the North, and repairing to him at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> his Majesty asked him of the state of his Army; and, after some relation of it, he told his Majesty, that the Commanders and Officers of the Army, had a <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> mind to Petition the Parliament, as others of his People had done, and shewed him the Copy of a Petition; which he read, and finding it to be very humble, desiring the Parliament might receive no interruption in the Reformation of Church, and State, to the Model of Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI>'s days, his Majesty told him, that he saw no harm in it; where∣upon Captain <HI>Leg</HI> replied, that he believed all the Officers of the Ar∣my would like it, only, he thought, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jacob Ashly</HI> would be unwilling to sign it, out of fear that it might displease Him. His Majesty then read the Petition over again; and observing nothing in Matter or Form he conceived could possibly give just cause of Offence, he deli∣vered <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> it to him again, bidding him give it to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jacob Ashly,</HI> for whose satisfaction he writ C. R. upon it, to testify his Approbation; and he wished that the Petition might be seen and published, and then he be∣lieved it would appear no dangerous one, nor a just ground for the least Jealousy,</Q> or Misapprehension.</P>
<P><Q>“”FOR M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jermyn,</HI> he said, it was well known that he was gone from <HI>White-Hall,</HI> before he received the desire of both Houses for the re∣straint of his Servants; neither returned he thither, or passed over by any Warrant granted by him after that time. For the breach of Pri∣viledge in the Accusation of the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the five Mem∣bers <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of the House of Commons, he told them, he thought, he had given so ample satisfaction in his several Messages to that purpose, that it should have been no more pressed against him; being confident, if the breach of Priviledge had been greater than ever had been before offer'd, his acknowledgment and retractation had been greater than ever King had given: besides the not examining how many of His Priviledges had been invaded in defence, and vindication of the other. And therefore, he hoped his true, and earnest protestation in his An∣swer to their Order concerning the Militia, would so far have satisfied them of his Intentions then, that they would no more have enter∣tained <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> any Imagination of any other design, than he there expressed. But why the listing so many Officers, and entertaining them at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> should be misconstrued, he said, he much marvelled, when it was notoriously known the Tumults at <HI>Westminster</HI> were so great,
<PB N="364" REF="3820"/>
and their demeanour so seandalous and seditious, that he had good cause to suppose his own Person, and those of his Wife and Children, to be in apparent danger; and therefore, he had great reason to appoint a Guard about him, and to accept the dutiful tender of the services of any of his loving Subjects, which was all he did to the Gentlemen of the Inns of Court.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> he assured them in the Word of a King, that he had his Warrant to pass the Seas, and had left his Court, Before ever he heard of the Vote of the House of Commons, or had any cause to imagin that his absence would have been excepted against. What <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> their Advertisements were from <HI>Rome▪ Venice, Paris,</HI> and other parts, or what the Pope▪s Nuntio sollicits the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> to do: or from what Persons such informations come to them, or how the credit and reputation of such persons had been sifted and examined, he said, he knew not; but was confident no sober honest man in his Kingdoms could believe, that he was so desperate, or so senseless, to entertain such designs, as would not only bury this his Kingdom in suddain distraction and ruin, but his own Name and Posterity in per∣petual Scorn, and Infamy. And therefore, he said, he could have wished in matters of so high and tender a Nature, wherewith the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> minds of h s good Subjects must needs be startled, all the expressions had been so plain and easy, that nothing might stick with them that reflected upon his Majesty,</Q> since they thought fit to publish it at all.</P>
<P><Q>“”AND having now dealt thus plainly and freely with them, by way of Answer to the particular grounds of their Fears, he said, he hoped, upon a due consideration and weighing of both together, they would not find the grounds to be of that moment to beget, or longer to con∣tinue, a misunderstanding between them; or force them to apply themselves to the use of any other power, than what the Law had given them: the which he allways intended should be the measure of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> his own Power, and expected it should be the rule of his Subjects Obe∣dience.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”CONCERNING his own Fears and Jealousies, as he had no Inten∣tion of accusing them, so he said, he was sure no words spoken by him on the Suddain at <HI>Theobalds</HI> would bear that Interpretation. He had said, for his residence near them, he wished it might be so safe and honourable, that he had no cause to absent himself from <HI>White Hall;</HI> and how That could be a breach of Priviledge of Parliament he could not understand. He said, he had explained his meaning in his Answer a<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>New-Market,</HI> at the presentation of that Declaration, concerning <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the printed seditious Pamphlets, and Sermons, and the great Tumults at <HI>Westminster:</HI> And he said, he must appeal to them, and all the world, whether he might not justly suppose himself in danger of either. And i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he were now at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> he asked them, what security he had, that the like should not be Again? especially if any Delinquents of that Nature had been apprehended by the Ministers of Justice, and had been rescued by the people, and so as yet had escaped Unpunished. He told them, if they had not yet been informed of the seditious words used in, and the circumstances of those Tumults, and would appoint some way for the examination of them, he would require <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> some of his learned Counsel to attend with such Evidence as might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them; and till that were done, or some other course should be taken for his security, he said, they could not with reason won∣der,</Q>
<PB N="365" REF="3830"/>
that he intended not to be, where he most desired to be.</P>
<P><Q>“”HE asked them, whether there could Yet want evidence of his hearty and importunate desire to joyn with his Parliament, and all his faithful Subjects, in defence of the Religion, and publick good of the Kingdom? Whether he had given them no other earnest but Words, to secure them of those desires? He told them the very Remonstrance of the House of Commons (published in <HI>November</HI> last) of the State of the Kingdom allowed him a more Real Testimony of his good Af∣fections, than Words; that Remonstrance valued his Acts of Grace and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Justice at so high a rate, that it declared the Kingdom to be Then a Garner, tho' it had charged it self by Bills of Subsidies and Poll-money, with the levy of six hundred thousand pounds, besides the contracting a debt of two hundred and twenty thousand pounds more to his Sub∣ject<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Scotland.</HI> He asked them, whether the Bills for the Triennial Parliament, for relinquishing his Title of imposing upon Merchandize, and power of pressing of Soldiers, for the taking away the Star-Cham∣ber, and High-Commission Courts, for the regulating the Counsel Ta∣ble, were but Words? whether the Bills for the Forrests, the Stannery Courts, the Clarke of the Market, and the taking away the Votes of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Bishops out of the Lord's House, were but Words? Lastly, what greater earnest of his trust, and relyance on his Parliament could he give, than the passing the Bill for the continuance of this Present Parliament? The Length of which, he said, he hoped, would never alter the Na∣ture of Parliaments, and the Constitution of this Kingdom; or invite his Subjects So much to abuse his Confidence, as to esteem any thing fit for this Parliament to do, which were not fit, if it were in his power to Dissolve it to Morrow. And after all these, and many other Acts of Grace on his part, that he might be sure of a perfect reconciliation between him and all his Subjects, he had offer'd, and was still ready to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> grant, a free, and general pardon, as ample as themselves should think fit. Now if those were not real expressions of the Affections of his Soul for the Publick Good of this Kingdom, he said, he must confess that he wanted skill to manifest them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”TO conclude, alltho' he thought his Answer allready full to that point concerning his return to <HI>London,</HI> he told them, that he was willing to declare, that he looked upon it as a matter of so great weight, as with reference to the affairs of this Kingdom, and to his own incli∣nations and desires, that if all he could Say, or Do, could raise a mu∣tual Confidence (the only way, with Gods blessing, to make them all <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> happy) and, by their incouragement, the Laws of the Land, and the Government of the City of <HI>London,</HI> might recover some life for his security; he would overtake their desires, and be assoon with them, as they could wish. And in the mean time, he would be sure that nei∣ther the business of <HI>Ireland,</HI> nor any other advantage for This Kingdom should suffer through His Default, or by his Absence; he being so far from repenting the Acts of his Justice and Grace, which he had all∣ready performed to his people, that, he said, he should, with the same alacrity, be still ready to add such New ones, as might best advance the Peace,</Q> Honour, and Prosperity of this Nation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> THEY who now read this Declaration, and remember only the inso∣lent, and un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utiful Expressions in that Declaration, to which this was an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the more insolent and seditious Actions which preceded, accompamed, and attended it, may think, that the style was not an∣swerable
<PB N="366" REF="3840"/>
to the Provocation, nor Princely enough for such a Contest; and may believe, that if his Majesty had then expressed himself with more Indignation for what he had suffer'd, and more Resolution, <Q>“”that he would No More endure those sufferings,</Q> they who were not Yet grown to the hardiness of Avowing the contempt of the King (and most of them having designs to be great With, and By Him, whom they pro∣voked) would sooner have been checked, and recovered their Loyalty and Obedience. But they again who consider and remember that Juncture of time, the incredible disadvantage his Majesty suffer'd by the misun∣derstanding of his going to the House of Commons, and by the Popular <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> mistake of Priviledge of Parliament, and consequently of the breach of those Priviledges: And, on the contrary, the great height and reputa∣tion the Factious Party had arrived to, the stratagems they used, and the infusions they made into the people, <Q>“”of the Kings disinclination to the Laws of the Land; and especially, "that he had consented to all those excellent Laws made this Parliament (of which the people were possessed) very unwillingly, and meant to avoid them: That the Queen had an irreconcilable Hatred to the Religion professed, and to the whole Nation, and that her Power was unquestionable: That there was a design to send the Prince beyond the Seas, and to marry <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> him to some Papist:</Q> Above all (which the principal of them, with wonderful confidence, in all places avowed to be true) <Q>“”that the Re∣bellion in <HI>Ireland</HI> was fomented, and countenanced at least, by the Queen,</Q> that good terms might be got for the Catholicks in <HI>England:</HI> I say, whoever remembers all this, and, that though it might be pre∣sumed, that the exorbitancy of the Parliament might be very offensive to some sober and discerning men, yet his Majesty had no reason to pre∣sume of their eminent and vehement Zeal on his behalf, since he saw all those (some few only excepted) from whom he might challenge the duty, and faith of servants <HI>usque ad aras,</HI> and for whose sake he had <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> undergone many difficulties, either totally aliened from his service, and ingaged Against him, or, like men in a Trance, unapplicable to it: He will, I say, conclude that it concerned his Majesty, by all gentleness and condescension, to undeceive, and recover men to their sobriety and understanding, before he could hope to make them apprehensive of their own duty, or the reverence that was due to him; and therefore, that he was to descend to all possible Arts, and Means to that purpose, it be∣ing very evident, that men would no sooner discern his Princely Justice and Clemency, than they must be sensible of the Indignities which were offer'd to him; and incensed against those, who were the Authors of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> them.</P>
<P>AND the truth is (which I speak knowingly) at that time, the King's Resolution was to Shelter himself wholely under the Law; to grant any thing, that by the Law he was obliged to grant; and to deny, what by the Law was in his own power, and which he found inconvenient to consent to; and to oppose and punish any extravagant attempt by the force and power of the Law, presuming that the King and the Law to∣gether would have been strong enough for any encounter that could happen; and that the Law was so sensible a thing, that the People would easily perceive who endeavoured to Preserve, and who to Suppress it, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and dispose themselves accordingly.</P>
<P>THE day before this Answer of his Majesty came to the Members then sitting at <HI>Westminster,</HI> though they knew they should speedily
<PB N="367" REF="3850"/>
receive it, lest somewhat in it might Answer, and so prevent some other scandals they had a mind to lay to his Majesty's charge, they sent a Pe∣tition to him, in the Name of the Lords and Commons, upon occasion of the short cursory Speech he made to their Committee ▪which is be∣fore mentioned) at the delivery of their Declaration at <HI>New-Market,</HI> in which they told him,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Petition of the Lords and Commons presented to his Majesty at <HI>York, March 26. 1642.</HI></NOTE> <Q>“”THAT the Lords and Commons in Parliament could not conceive, that that Declaration, which he received from them at <HI>New-Market,</HI> was such as did deserve that censure his Majesty was pleased to lay <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> upon them in that Speech, which his Majesty made to their Com∣mittee; their address therein, being accompanied with plainness, hu∣mility, and faithfulness, they thought more proper for the removing the distraction of the Kingdom, than if they had then proceeded ac∣cording to his Message of the twentieth of <HI>January;</HI> by which he was pleased to desire, that they would declare, what they intended to do for his Majesty, and what they expected to be done for Themselves; in both which, they said, they had been very much hinder▪d by his Majesty's denial to secure them, and the whole Kingdom, by disposing the Militia as they had divers times most Humbly Petitioned. And <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> yet, they said, they had not been alltogether negligent of either, having lately made good proceedings in preparing a Book of Rates, to be passed in a Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, and likewise the most material heads of those humble desires, which they intended to make to his Majesty for the good and contentment of his Majesty and his People; but none of those could be perfected before the Kingdom be put in safety, by setling the Militia: And until his Majesty should be pleased to concur with his Parliament in those necessary things, they held it impossible for his Majesty to give the world, or his People, such satis∣faction concerning the Fears and Jealousies, which they had expressed, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> as they hoped his Majesty had allready received touching that ex∣ception, which he was pleased to take to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI>'s Speech. As for his Majesty's Fears and Doubts, the ground whereof was from seditious Pamphlets and Sermons, they said, they should be as careful to endea∣vour the removal of them, assoon as they should understand what Pam∣phlets and Sermons were by his Majesty intended, as they had been to prevent all dangerous Tumults. And if any extraordinary Concourse of people out of the City to <HI>Westminster</HI> had the face and shew of Tu∣mult and Danger, in his Majesty's apprehension, it would appear to be caused by his Majesty's denial of such a Guard to his Parliament, as <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> they might have cause to Confide in; and by taking into <HI>White-Hall</HI> such a Guard for Himself, as gave just cause of Jealousy to the Parlia∣ment, and of Terrour and Offence to his People. They told him, they sought nothing but his Majesty's Honour, and the Peace and Prospe∣rity of his Kingdoms; and that they were heartily sorry, they had such plentiful matter for an Answer to that Question, whether his Ma∣jesty had violated their Laws? They besought his Majesty to remem∣ber, that the Government of this Kingdom, as it was, in a great part, managed by his Ministers before the beginning of this Parliament, consisted of many continued and multiplied Acts of violation of Laws; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the wounds whereof were scarcely heal'd, when the Extremity of all those violations was far exceeded by the late Strange, and unheard of breach of their Laws in the Accusation of the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the five Members of the Commons House, and in the proceed∣ings
<PB N="368" REF="3860"/>
thereupon;</Q> for which they had yet received no full satisfaction.</P>
<P><Q>“”TO his Majesty's next Question, whether he had denied any Bill for the ease and security of his Subjects? They wished they could stop in the midst of their Answer; that with much thankfulness they acknow∣ledged, that his Majesty had passed many good Bills full of contentment and advantage to his People: but Truth and Necessiity inforced them to add this, that even in, or about the time of passing those Bills, some design or other had been on foot, which, if it had taken effect, would not only have deprived them of the fruit of those Bills, but have re∣duced them to a worse condition of confusion, than that wherein the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Parliament found them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND if his Majesty had asked them the third Question intimated in that Speech, what They had done for Him? they told him, their Answer would have been much more easy; That they had paid two Armies with which the Kingdom was burthen'd the last year, and had undergone the Charge of the War in <HI>Ireland</HI> at this time, when, through many other excessive Charges and pressures, his Subjects had been ex∣hausted, and the stock of the Kingdom very much diminished; which great mischiefs, and the charges thereupon ensuing, had been occa∣sioned by the evil Counsels so powerful with his Majesty, which had <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and would cost this Kingdom more than two Millions; all which, in justice,</Q> ought to have been born by his Majesty.</P>
<P><Q>“”AS for that free and general pardon his Majesty had been pleased to offer, they said, it could be no security to their Fears and Jealousies, for which his Majesty seem'd to propound it; because they arose not from any Guilt of their own Actions, but from the evil designs, and attempts of others.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”TO that their Humble Answer to that Speech, they desired to add an Information, which they had lately received from the Deputy Go∣vernour of the Merchant Adventurers at <HI>Rotterdam</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> an unknown person, appertaining to the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> did lately sollicit one <HI>James Henly</HI> a Marriner, to go to <HI>Elsenore,</HI> and to take charge of a Ship in the Fleet of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> there prepared; which he should conduct to <HI>Hull.</HI> In which Fleet likewise, he said, a great Army was to be transported; and alltho' they were not apt to give credit to Informations of that Nature, yet they could not alltogether think it fit to be neglected; but that it might justly add somewhat to the weight of their Fears and Jealousies, considering with what cir∣cumstances it was accompanied; with the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>'s preceding ex∣pressions in his Letter to her Majesty, and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lewis Dives;</HI> and his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Majesty's succeeding course of withdrawing himself North-ward from his Parliament, in a manner very suitable and correspondent to that evil Counsel; which they doubted, would make much deeper im∣pression in the generality of his People: and therefore, they most hum∣bly advised, and besought his Majesty, for the procuring and setling the confidence of his Parliament and all his Subjects, and for the other important reasons concerning the recovery of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and securing This Kingdom, which had been formerly presented to him, he would be graciously pleased, with all convenient speed, to return to those Ports, and to close with the Counsel and desire of his Parliament; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> where he should find their dutiful affections and endeavours ready to attend his Majesty with such entertainment, as should not only give him just cause of security in their faithfulness, but other manifold
<PB N="369" REF="3870"/>
evidences of their earnest intentions, and endeavours to advance his Majesty's Service, Honour, and Contentment; and to establish it upon the sure Foundation of the Peace, and Prosperity of all his King∣doms.</Q></P>
<P>THIS, which They called a Petition, being presented to the King, his Majesty immediately returned, by the same Messengers, his Answer in these words:</P>
<P><Q>“”IF you would have had the patience to have expected our Answer<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer</NOTE> to your last Declaration (which, considering the nature of it, hath <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> not been long in coming) We believe, you would have saved your selves the labour of saying much of this Message. And We could wish, that our Priviledges on all parts were so stated, that this way of Cor∣respondency might be preserved with that freedom, which hath been used of old. For We must tell you, that if you may ask Any thing of us by Message or Petition, and in what Language (how Unusual soever) you think fit, and we must neither Deny the thing you ask, nor give a reason why we cannot Grant it, without being taxed of breaking your Priviledges, or being Counselled by those, who are Ene∣mies to the Peace of the Kingdom, and favourers of the Irish Rebel∣lion <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> (for we have seen your printed Votes upon our Message from <HI>Huntington)</HI> you will reduce all our Answers hereafter into a very little room; in plain English, it is to take away the freedom of our Vote; which, were We but a Subject, were high Injustice, but being your King,</Q> we leave all the world to judge What it is.</P>
<P><Q>“”IS this the way to compose all misunderstandings? We thought, we shewed you one, by our Message of the twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> if you have a better or readier, We shall willingly hearken to it, for hitherto you have shewed us None. But why the refusal to consent to your Order, which You call a Denial of the Militia, should be any <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> interruption to it, we cannot understand. For the Militia, which we allways thought necessary to be setled, we never denied the Thing (as we told you in our Answer of the 28 of <HI>January)</HI> to the Petition of the House of Commons, for we accepted the Persons, except for Corporations; we only denied the Way. You ask it by way of Ordi∣nance, and with such a Preface, as we can neither with justice to our Honour, or Innocency consent to. You exclude Us from any power in the disposition or execution of it together with you, and for a time utterly Unlimited. We tell you, we would have the Thing done; allow the Persons, with that exception; desire a Bill, the only Good <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Old way of imposing on our subjects: We are extremely unsatisfied what an Ordinance is, but well satisfied, that without Our Consent it is Nothing, nor Binding▪ and it is evident by the long time spent in this Argument, the necessity and danger was not so imminent, but a Bill might have been prepared; which if it shall Yet be done, with that due regard to Us, and care of our People, in the limitation of the power and other circumstances, we shall recede from nothing we for∣merly expressed in that Answer to your Order; otherwise, we must declare to all the world, that we are not satisfied with, or shall ever allow our Subjects to be bound by, your printed Votes of the fifteenth <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> or sixteenth of this Month; or that under pretence of Declaring what the Law of the Land is, you shall, without Us, make a New Law, which is plainly the case of the Militia: and what is this but to intro∣duce an Arbitrary way of Government?</Q></P>

<Q>“”CONCERNING <HI>Pym</HI>'s Speech, you will have found, by what the Lord <HI>Compton</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Baynton</HI> brought from Us in Answer to that Message they brought to Us, that, as yet, we rest nothing satisfied in that particular.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AS for the seditious Pamphlets and Sermons, We are both sorry and ashamed (in so great variety, and in which our Rights, Honour, and Authority, are so insolently slighted and vilified, and in which the dignity and freedom of Parliaments is so much invaded, and vio∣lated) it should be asked of Us to name any. The mentioning of the Protestation protested, the Apprentices Protestation, <HI>To your Tents O Israel,</HI> or any other, would be too great an excuse for the rest: If <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> you think them not worth your enquiry, We have done. But We think it most strange to be told, that our denial of a Guard (which We yet never denied, but granted in an other manner, and under a Com∣mand at that time most accustomed in the Kingdom) or the denial of any thing else (which is in our power legally to deny) which in our understanding, of which God hath surely given us some use, is not fit to be granted, should be any excuse for so dangerous a Concourse of People; which, not only in Our apprehension, but, We believe, in the interpretation of the Law it self, hath been allways held most Tumul∣tuous, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and Seditious. And We must wonder, what, and whence come the Instructions and Informations, that those People have, who can so easily think themselves obliged by the Protestation to Assemble in such a manner for the defence of Priviledges, which cannot be so clear∣ly known to any of them, and so negligently pass over the considera∣tion, and defence of our Rights, so beneficial and necessary for them∣selves, and scarce unknown to any of them; which by their Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and even by the same Protestation, they are at least Equally obliged to defend. And what interruptions such kind of Assemblies may be to the freedom of future Parliaments (if <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> not seasonably discountenanced and suppressed) We must advise you to consider; as likewise, whether both our Rights and Powers may not by such means be usurped, by hands not trusted by the Constitu∣tion of this Kingdom. For our Guard, We refer you to Our Answer to your Declaration.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BY that Question of violating your Laws, by which We endeavour'd to express our care, and resolution to observe them▪ We did not expect, you would have been invited to have looked back so many years, for which you have had so ample reparation, neither looked we to have been reproached with the Actions of our Ministers Then against the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Laws, whilst we express so great Zeal for the Present Defence of them; it being our resolution, upon observation of the mischief which then grew by Arbitrary Power (tho' made plausible to us by the suggestions of Necessity and imminent Danger, and take you heed, You fall not into the same error, upon the same suggestions) hereafter to keep the Rule Our self, and to Our Power require the same from all others. But above all, We must be more sensible of what you cast upon us for requital of those good Bills, you cannot deny. We have denied any such design; and as God Allmighty must judge in that point between us, who knows our upright intentions at the passing those Laws, so <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in the mean time we defy the Devil to prove, that there was any de∣sign (with Our Knowledge, or Privity) in or about the time of passing those Bills, that, had it taken effect, could have deprived Our Subjects
<PB N="371" REF="3890"/>
of the fruit of them. And therefore we demand full reparation in this point, that we may be cleared in the sight of all the world, and chiefly in the Eyes of our loving Subjects, from so notorious and false an im∣putation,</Q> as this is.</P>
<P><Q>“”WE are far from denying what you have done; for We acknow∣ledge the charge Our People hath sustained in keeping the two Armies, and in relieving <HI>Ireland;</HI> of which we are so sensible, that in regard of those great burthens Our People hath undergone, We have, and do patiently suffer those extreme Personal Wants, as our Predecessors have <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> been seldom put to, rather than We would press upon them; which we hope in time,</Q> will be considered on your parts.</P>
<P><Q>“”IN our offer of a general pardon, our intent was to compose and se∣cure the general condition of our Subjects, conceiving that, in these times of great distractions, the good Laws of the Land have not been enough observed; but it is a strange world, when Princes proffered Favours are counted Reproaches; yet if you like not this Our offer, We have done.</Q></P>
<P>CONCERNING any discourses of Forreign Forces, <Q>though We have “”given you a full Answer in Ours to your last Declaration, yet We must <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> tell you, we have neither so ill an opinion of Our own merit, or the Affections of our good Subjects, as to think Our self in need of any For∣reign Forces to preserve us from oppression; and we shall not need for any other purpose: but are confident, through Gods providence, not to want the good wishes and Assistance of the whole Kingdom, be∣ing resolved to build upon that sure Foundation, the Law of the Land; and we take it very ill, that General discourses between an Unknown Person and a Marriner, or inferences upon Letters, should be able to prevail in matters so Improbable in themselves, and Scandalous to Us; for which we cannot but likewise ask reparation, not only for the vin∣dication <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of our own Honour, but also thereby to settle the minds of our Subjects, whose fears and jealousies would soon vanish, were they not fed and maintained by such false and malicious Rumours as these.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR Our return to Our Parliament, We have given you a full An∣swer in Ours to your Declaration; and you ought to look on Us as not Gone, but Driven (we say not By you, yet) From you. And if it be not so easy for you to make Our residence in <HI>London</HI> so safe, as We could desire, We are and will be contented, that Our Parliament be Adjourn'd to such a place, where we may be fitly and safely with you. For tho' We are not pleased to be at this distance, yet you are not to <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> expect Our presence, until you shall both secure us concerning Our just Apprehensions of tumultuary Insolences, and likewise give Us sa∣tisfaction for those insupportable and insolent Scandals, that are raised upon Us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”TO Conclude, as We have or shall not refuse any agreeable way to Justice or Honour, which shall be offer'd to Us for the begetting a right understanding between us; so We are resolved that no streights or ne∣cessities, to which We May be driven, shall ever compel us to do that, which the reason and understanding that God hath given us, and Our Honour, and Interest, with which God hath trusted us for the good of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Our Posterity and Kingdoms, shall render unpleasant and grievous to Us. And we assure you, how meanly soever You are pleased to value the discharge of Our publick Duty, We are so conscious to Our self of having done Our part since this Parliament, that in whatsoever con∣dition
<PB N="372" REF="3900"/>
We now stand, We are confident of the continued protection from Allmighty God, and the constant Gratitude, Obedience, and Af∣fection from Our People.</Q> And We shall trust God with all.</P>
<P>THESE quick Answers from the King gave them very much trouble, and made it evident to them, that he would be no more Swagger'd into concessions, that he thought unreasonable, or perswaded to them upon General promises, or an Implicit confidence in their Future modesty; but that he demanded reparation for the breach of his Priviledges, and so fought with them with their own Weapons, troubled them much more; apprehending that, in a short time, the People might be per∣swaded <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to believe, that the King was in the right, and had not been well dealt with: and tho' some few, who thought themselves too far ingaged to retire, were glad of the sharpness of these Paper-Skirmishes, which they believed made the wound still wider, and more incurable; yet the Major part, which had been induced to joyn with them out of Confidence that the King would yield, and that their boldness and importunity in Asking, would prevail with his Majesty to Consent, wished themselves fairly unintangled; and I have heard many of the fiercest Concurrers, and who have ever since kept them company, at that time profess, <Q>“”that if any expedient might be found to reconcile the present difference <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> about the Militia, they would no more Adventure upon Demands of the like Nature:</Q> and the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> himself was startled, and con∣fessed to his Friends, <Q>“”that he desired a more moderate proceeding should be in Parliament; and that the King, who had Given so much, should Receive some satisfaction.</Q> But those of the Court, who thought their faults to their Master most unpardonable, could not endure that the youngest Courtier, should be the eldest Convert; and therefore, by repeating what the King and Queen had said of him Heretofore, and by fresh Intelligence, which they procured from <HI>York,</HI> of what the King Then thought of him, they perswaded him, <Q>“”that his condition was too <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> desperate to recede:</Q> and all men were perswaded, that this steddy de∣portment of the King proceeded from some new evil Counsellors, who would be assoon Destroyed, as Discovered; and that Then they would so carry themselves, that the King should owe his Greatness, and his Glory (for they still said, "he should excel all his Predecessors in both) to Their formed Counsels and Activity, and not to the whispers of those, who thought to do his business without them. And I am per∣swaded that even then, and I was at that time no stranger to the persons of most that governed, and a diligent observer of their carriage, they had rather a design of making themselves powerful with the King, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> great at Court, than of lessening the power of the One, or reforming the discipline of the Other: but, no doubt, there were some Few in the number that looked further; yet by pretending That, kept up the Mettal of writing, and inclined them for their Honour to new Decla∣rations.</P>
<P>THE King found himself at some ease, and most Persons of Quality of that great County, and of the Counties adjacent, resorted to him, and many persons of condition from <HI>London,</HI> and those parts, who had not the courage to attend upon him at <HI>White-Hall;</HI> so that the Court appeared with some lustre. And now he begun to think of executing <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> some of those resolutions, which he had made with the Queen before her departure; One of which was, and to be first done, the removing the Earls of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> from their Offices in the Court, the One
<PB N="373" REF="3910"/>
of Chamberlain, the Other of Groom of the Stole, which hath the re∣putation and benefit of being first Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber. In∣deed no man could speak in the justification of either of them, yet no man thought them Equally culpable. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was a Per∣son meerly of the Kings, and his Fathers creation; raised from the con∣dition of a private Gentleman, a younger Brother of an extraction that lay under a great blemish, and without any fortune, to a great height by their meer favour, and bounty. And they had not only adorn'd him with Titles, Honours, and Offices, but inabled him to support those in <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the highest Lustre, and with the largest Expence: and this King had drawn many inconveniences, and great disadvantages, upon himself and his service, by his preferring him to some Trusts, which Others did not only Think themselves, but Really were worthier of; but especially by indulging him so far in the rigorous execution of his Office of Chief Justice in Eyre, in which he brought more prejudice upon the Court, and more discontent upon the King, from the most considerable part of the Nobility and Gentry in <HI>England,</HI> than proceeded from any one Action, that had its rise from the King's will and pleasure, tho' it was not without some Warrant from Law; but having not been practised <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> for some hundreds of years, was looked upon as a terrible Innovation and Exaction upon Persons, who knew not that they were in any fault; nor was any imputed to them, but the Original Sin of their Forefathers, even for which they were obliged to pay great penalties and ransoms. That Such a Servant should suffer his Zeal to lessen and decay towards Such a Master, and that he should keep a Title to lodge in his Bed-Chamber, from whose Court he had, upon the matter, withdrawn him∣self, and adhered to, and assisted those, who affronted and contemned his Majesty so notoriously, would admit of no manner of Interposition and Excuse.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> LESS was to be objected against the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> who as he had been, all his life, without obligations from the Court, and believed he had undergone oppression there, so he was, in all respects, the same man he had allways professed himself to be, when the King put him into that Office; and in receiving of which, many men believed, that He rather gratify'd the King, than that his Majesty had obliged Him in conferring it; and it had been, no doubt, the chief reason of putting the Staff in his hand, because in that Conjuncture no other man, who would in any degree have appeared worthy of it, had the courage to receive it. How∣ever having taken the Charge upon him, he ought, no doubt, to have <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> taken all his Masters concernments more to heart, than he had done; and he can never be excused for staying in <HI>White-Hall,</HI> when the King was with that Outrage driven from thence, and for choosing to behold the triumph of the Members return to <HI>Westminster,</HI> rather than to at∣tend his Majesty's Person in so great perplexity to <HI>Hampton-Court;</HI> which had been his duty to have done, and for failing wherein no other excuse can be made, but that, after he had taken so full a resolution to have waited upon his Majesty thither, that he had dressed himself in his travelling habit, he was diverted from it by the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who ougt to have accompanied him in the service, and by his averment, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> "that if he went, he should be assassinated; which it was not possible should have ever been so much as thought of.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all this, the Persons trusted by his Majesty and remaining at <HI>London,</HI> had no sooner notice of it (which his Majesty
<PB N="374" REF="3920"/>
fent to them, that he might be advised the best way of doing it) but they did all they could to disswade the pursuing it. They did not think it a good conjuncture to make those two persons desperate; and they knew that they were not of the temper and inclinations of those, who had too much credit with them, nor did desire to drive things to the ut∣most extremities, which could never better their conditions; and that they did both rather desire to find any Expedients, by which they might make a safe and an honourable Retreat, than to Advance in the way they were ingaged in. But the Argument they chiefly insisted on to the King, was, <Q>“”that being deprived of their Offices, they would be able <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to do more mischief, and ready to imbark themselves with the most desperate persons,</Q> in the most desperate Attempts; which fell out ac∣cordingly. And there is great reason to believe, that if that resolution the King had taken, had not been too obstinately pursued at that time, many of the mischiefs, which afterwards fell out, would have been pre∣vented; and, without doubt, if the Staff had remained still in the hands of the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> by which he was charged with the defence and se∣curity of the King's Person, he would never have been prevailed with to have taken upon him the Command of that Army, which was after∣wards raised against the King, and with which so many battles were <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> fought. And there can be as little doubt in any man, who knew well the nature and temper of that time, that it had been very difficult, if not utterly impossible, for the two Houses of Parliament to have raised an Army Then, if the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> had not consented to be General of that Army.</P>
<P>BuT the King was inexorable in the point; he was obliged by pro∣mise to the Queen at parting, which he would not break; and her Ma∣jesty had contracted so great an indignation against the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> whose ingratitude indeed towards Her was very odious, that she had said, "She would never live in the Court, if He kept his place. And so the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> King sent an Order to <HI>Littleton</HI> the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, <Q>“”that he should require the Staff and Key from the one, and the other, and receive them into his custody.</Q> The Keeper trembled at the Office, and had not courage to undertake it. He went presently to the Lord <HI>Falk∣land,</HI> and desired him to assist him in making his excuse to the King. He made many professions of his Duty to the King, <Q>“”who, he hoped, would not command him in an affair so unsuitable to the Office he held under him: that no Keeper had been imployed in such a service; that if he should execute the Order he had received, it would in the first place be Voted a breach of Priviledge in him, being a Peer; and the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> House would commit him to Prison, by which the King would receive the greatest affront, tho' He should be ruin'd; whereas the thing it self might be done by a more proper Officer, without any incon∣venience.</Q></P>
<P>HOW weak soever the Reasons were, the Passion was strong, and the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> could not refuse to convey his Letter to the King, which contained his Answer in his own words, with all the imaginable pro∣fessions of Duty and Zeal for his Service. How ill soever his Majesty was satisfied, he saw the business would not be done That way; and therefore he writ immediately a Letter, all in his own hand, to the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Lord <HI>Falkland;</HI> in which with some gracious expressions of excuse for putting that work upon Him, he commanded him <Q>“”to require the sur∣render of the Ensigns of their Offices from those two Earls.</Q> The Lord
<PB N="375" REF="3930"/>
<HI>Falkland</HI> was a little troubled in receiving the command; They were persons from whom he had allways received great civilities, and with whom he had much credit; and this harsh office might have been more naturally, and as Effectually performed by a Gentleman Usher, as the same Staff had been demanded before from the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> within less than a year. However, he would make no excuse, being a very punctual and exact Person in the performances of his Duty; and so went to both of them: and met them coming to the House, and imparted his Message to them: They desired him very civilly, <Q>“”that he would give <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> them leave to confer a little together, and they would, within half an hour,</Q> send for him into the House of Commons; whither he went, and they within less time, sent to him to meet them in S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Cot∣ton</HI>'s Garden (a place adjacent, where the Members of both Houses used frequently to walk) and there with very few words, they delivered the Staff and the Key into his hands, who immediately carried them to his Lodging; and They went up to the House of Peers: and presently both Houses took notice of it, and with Passion, and bitter Expressions against the evil Counsellors, who had given his Majesty that Counsel, they con∣curred in a Vote, <Q>“”that whosoever presumed to accept of either of those <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Offices,</Q> should be reputed an Enemy to his Country; and then they proceeded with more impetuosity in the business of the Militia, and all other matters which most trenched upon the King's Authority.</P>
<P>WHILST they were so eager in pursuit of the Militia, and pretended the necessity so eminent, that they could not defer the disposition thereof till it might be Formally, and Regularly settled by Bill, they had their Eye upon an other Militia, the Royal Navy; without recovering of which to their own power (tho' they were satisfy'd by the pulse of the People, that they would joyn with them, and be generally obedient to their commands) they had no mind to venture upon the execution of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> their Land Ordinance. And therefore, in the beginning of the Spring, when the Fleet for that year was provided, after they had excepted against such Persons to be Captains of Ships, as they thought not devoted to them (as is before mentioned) they sent a formal Message to the Lords, <Q>“”that the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> Lord Admiral, might be moved to constitute the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> his Admiral of the Fleet for that years service, being a Person of such Honour and experience, as they might safely Confide in him; and that the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> might be desired to undertake that service.</Q> The Lords thought fit that the King's approbation might be first desired, before it was recommended <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> but the Commons thought that super∣fluous, since the Officers of the Fleet were absolutely in the Earls dis∣posal; and therefore refused to send to the King, but of Themselves sent to both the one Earl, and the other; and the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> being well pleased with the Trust, very frankly, without waiting the King's consent, declared "that he was ready to undertake the imployment. But this being so publickly agitated, the King could not but take notice of it; and finding that the business should not be proposed to him, thought it necessary, to signify his pleasure in it, that so at least the Lord Ad∣miral might not pretend innocence, if ought should be done to his disser∣vice; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and therefore, he appointed M<SUP>r</SUP> Secretary <HI>Nicholas</HI> to write to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> <Q>“”that his Majesty expected that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pen∣nington</HI> should Command that Fleet, as he had done two or three years before.</Q> This Letter being communicated to both Houses, and the
<PB N="376" REF="3940"/>
Lord Admiral being thereby upon the disadvantage of a Single contest with the King, the House of Commons, rather out of kindness and respect to the Earl, than of Duty to the King, Condescended to joyn with the Lords in a Message to his Majesty; which they sent not by Members of their own, but directed the Lord Keeper <Q>“”to inclose it in a Letter to the Secretary attending the King,</Q> and to send the same to <HI>York;</HI> which he did accordingly. The Message was:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Message from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Houses to the King, Mar. 28. 1642.</NOTE> <Q>“”THAT the Lords and Commons, in this present Parliament assem∣bled, having found it necessary to provide, and set to Sea, a strong and powerful Navy for the defence of this Kingdom against Forreign force, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and for the security of his Majesty's other Dominions, the Charge whereof was to be born by the Common-wealth: and taking notice of the indisposition of the Lord Admiral, which disabled him, at that time, for commanding the Fleet in his own Person, did thereupon re∣commend unto his Lordship the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> a Person of such Quality and Abilities, as in whom they might best Confide, to supply his Lordships room for this imployment; and understanding that his Majesty hath Since signify'd his pleasure concerning that Command for <HI>John Pennington,</HI> they said, they did hold it their Duty to repre∣sent to his Majesty the great danger, and mischief the Common-wealth <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> was like to sustain by such interruption; and therefore did humbly beseech his Majesty, that the Noble Person, recommended by both Houses of Parliament for this service, might be no longer detained from it,</Q> out of any particular respect to any other Person whatsoever.</P>
<P>THE same day that this Message came to his Majesty, he dispatched<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> an Answer to the Lord Keeper; in which he told him, <Q>“”That he won∣der'd both at the Form, and Matter of that inclosed paper he had sent to him, in the Name of both Houses of Parliament: It being neither by the way of Petition, Declaration, or Letter; and for the Matter, he believed, it was the first time, that the Houses of Parliament had <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> taken upon them the Nomination, or Recommendation of the chief Sea-Commander; but it added to the wonder, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Penning∣ton</HI> being allready appointed by him for that service, upon the recom∣mendation of his Admiral, and no fault so much as alledged against him, another should be recommended to him. Therefore he said, his resolution upon that point was, that he would not alter him, whom he had allready appointed to Command that years Fleet; whose every ways sufficiency was so universally known, the which he was confi∣dent his Admiral, if there should be occasion, would make most evi∣dent; against whose testimony he supposed his Parliament would not <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> except. And tho' there were yet None appointed, or the said S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John,</HI> through some accident, not able to perform the service; yet, he said, the men of that profession were so well known to him, besides many other reasons, that (his Admiral excepted, because of his place) re∣commendations of that kind would not be acceptable to him.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Answer was no other than they expected, tho' they seem'd troubled at it, and pretended that they had many things of Misdemea∣nour to object against S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington,</HI> at least such matters as would render him incapable of that Trust; the greatest of which was, that he had convey'd the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> over Sea; tho' they well knew (as is be∣fore <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> mentioned) that he had the King's Warrant and Command for that purpose; and therefore moved the Lords that he might be sent for to be examined upon many particulars: and in the mean time, whilst
<PB N="377" REF="3950"/>
they caused him to attend their leisure to be examined, they proceeded in hastning the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> to make himself ready for the Service, who made no scruple of undertaking it; and the Earl of <HI>Northumber∣land</HI> receiving the Order, and Desire of both Houses <Q>“”to grant his Com∣mission to him to be Admiral of that Fleet,</Q> thought himself suffi∣ciently excused towards the King, and did it accordingly. The two Houses in the mean time, without any further thought of procuring the King's Consent, preparing reasons to satisfy his Majesty for the Necessi∣ty, or Conveniency of their proceeding.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> MANY men, especially they, who at a distance observed and discern'd the difficulties the King was like to encounter, wonder'd that upon so apparent a breach of Trust, and act of Undutifulness, his Majesty did not at that time revoke the Lord Admiral's Commission, which was but during pleasure; and so put that sure Guard of the Kingdom, his Navy, under such a Command as he might depend upon. But the truth is, it was not Then Counsellable; for (besides that it was easier to Resolve, "that it was fit to remove the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> than to find a man competent for the place) that way it might have been possible to have prevented the going out of any Fleet to Sea, which would have <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> confirmed the frantick Jealousies of bringing in Forreign Forces; but not have reduced it to his own obedience.</P>
<P>THEY had, by degrees, so order'd the collection of Tonnage and Poun∣dage, by passing Bills for six weeks and two months at a time, and putting those, who should receive or pay those Duties otherwise than they were granted by those Bills into a Praemunire; and so terrify'd the old Customers, that the King had no other means of setting out his Fleet, than by the monies arising by the Customs, which they absolutely dis∣posed of; and at this time had contracted with the Victualler, made the Ships ready, and hired many Merchants Ships to joyn in that Fleet for <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Guard of the Seas. And whilst this matter of the Admiral was in suspence, they suffered the former Bill of Tonnage and Poundage to ex∣pire, and did not, till the very night before, pass a new Bill; which could not have the Royal Assent till many days after, the King being then at <HI>York.</HI> Yet the House of Commons, to salve all danger of the Praemunire, on the 24<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March,</HI> being the very day that the former Bill expired, sent an Order to all the Collectors of the Customs, many of which could not receive it in ten days after;</P>
<P><Q>“”THAT the new Bill being passed by both Houses for the continuance of those payments untill the third day of <HI>May</HI> (which could not yet <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> receive the Royal Assent, in regard of the remoteness of his Majesty's Person from the Parliament) which monies to be collected by that Bill were to be imployed in the necessary guarding of the Seas, and de∣fence of the Common-wealth: It was therefore order'd by the Com∣mons in Parliament, that the several Officers belonging to the Custom House, both in the Port in <HI>London,</HI> and the out-Ports, should not permit any Merchant or other to Lade, or Unlade any Goods, or Merchandizes, before such Persons do make due entries thereof in the Custom House. And it was declared also by the said Commons, that such Officers, upon the respective entry made by any Merchant as <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> aforesaid, should intimate to such Merchant, that it was the advice of the Commons, for the better ease of the said Merchants, and in re∣gard the respective Duties would relate, and become due as from that day; that the said Merchants upon entry of their Goods, as usually
<PB N="378" REF="3960"/>
they did, when a Law was in force to that purpose, would deposite so much money as the several Customs would amount unto, in the hands of such Officers, to be by them accounted to his Majesty, as the respective Customs due by the said Bill, when the said Bill should have the Royal Assent; or otherwise, his Majesty refusing the passing thereof, the said monies to be restored, upon demand, unto the several Mer∣chants respectively.</Q></P>
<P>BY which Order, which was a more absolute Dispensation for a Prae∣munire, than ever any <HI>Non-obstante</HI> granted by the Crown, the Customs were as frankly, and fully paid, as if an Act of Parliament had been <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> passed to that purpose; and assoon as the Commission could be sent, and returned from <HI>York,</HI> the Act was passed. But no doubt they had a fur∣ther design in suffering the Bill totally to expire, before they prepared a new One, than at that time was apprehended; and intended, under such a Popular necessity, which seem d to be occasioned by the King's absence, to bring their own Orders in such a reputation, that in another necessity which They should Declare, they might by the Precedent of this, which was the only Indemnity all those Merchants who paid, and the Officers, who received Customs, had for the preservation of their Estates, be currently and absolutely obeyed and submitted to. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>BY this it appears the King could not at That time, with conveniency or safety to his Affairs, displace the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> and he bel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eved, if his occasions should Hereafter require it, that the Time would be much more seasonable, when the Fleet was at Sea; and the Thing it self more practicable: which was a true conclusion. However, he expressed so much dislike against the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s commanding that Fleet, that he was not willing that any Officers, whom he valued, should take imployment under him; which he had shortly after cause to repent. For, by this means, the Vice-Admiralty, which was designed to Captain <HI>Cartwright,</HI> the Controller of the Navy, who hath since suf∣ficiently <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> testify'd how advantageously to his Majesty he would have ma∣naged that Charge, upon His refusal (which was occasioned by intima∣tion from his Majesty, as shall be hereafter mentioned) was conferred upon <HI>Batten,</HI> an obscure fellow; and, tho' a good Sea-man, unknown to the Navy, till he was, two or three years before, for money, made Surveyor, who executed it ever since with great animosity against the King's Service, of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>BEING, by this means, secure at Sea, they proceeded with more Vi∣gour at Land; and, tho' they thought it not Yet seasonable to execute their Ordinance for the Militia with any Form and Pomp, they di∣rected, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Underhand, their Agents and Emissaries, <Q>“”that the People, of Themselves, should choose Captains and Officers, and Train under the name of Voluntiers;</Q> which begun to be practiced in many places of the Kingdom, but only in those Corporations, and by those Inferiour people, who were notorious for Faction, and Schism in Religion. The King's Declarations, which were now carefully published, gave them some trouble, and made great impression, in Sober men, who were moved with the Reason, and in Rich men, who were startled at the Commands in them. But that Clause in the King's Answer to their De∣claration, presented to him at <HI>New-Market,</HI> in which he told them, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”that if they had not been informed of the seditious words used in, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the circumstances of the Tumults, and would appoint some way for the examination of them, that he would require some of his learned
<PB N="379" REF="3970"/>
Counsel to attend with such evidence as might satisfy them,</Q> troubled them much more. For if there were still so much courage left in the King's Counsel, that they durst appear to inform against any of those proceedings, which They favoured, they should find men grow more affraid of the Law than of Them; which would destroy all their designs. Therefore they resolved to proceed with all expedition, and severely against the Atturney General for his Trespass and Presumption upon their Priviledges, in the Accusation of the five Members, and the Lord <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imbolton:</HI> of the circumstances of which Proceeding, and Judgment <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> thereupon, being as extraordinary, and as distant from the Rules of Justice, at least of Practice, as any thing that then happen'd, it will not be amiss to set down two or three particulars.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after they had Impeached him (which is mentioned be∣fore) and the King had found it necessary to give over any prosecution against the Others, his Majesty being desirous now he had freed Them, that they should free His Atturney, writ a Letter from <HI>Royston,</HI> when he was in his way to <HI>York,</HI> to the Lord Keeper; in which he told him, <Q>“”that the Articles, which had been preferred against the Members, were, by Himself, delivered to his Atturney General engrossed in paper; and that he had then commanded him to accuse those Persons, upon those Articles of High-Treason, and other Misdemeanours; and, in His Name, to desire a Committee of Lords might be appointed to take the examination of such Witnesses as should be produced, as formerly had been done in cases of like nature, according to the Justice of the House. And his Majesty did further declare, that his said Atturney did not advise or contrive the said Articles, nor had any thing to do with, or in advising, any breach of Priviledge that followed after. And for what he did in obedience to His Commands, he conceived he was bound by Oath, and the duty of his Place, and by the Trust reposed in him <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> by his Majesty, so to do: and that if he had refused to obey his Ma∣jesty therein, his Majesty would have questioned him for breach of Oath, Duty, and Trust; but now having declared that he found cause wholely to desist from proceeding against the Persons accused, he had commanded him to proceed no further therein, nor to produce, nor discover any Proof concerning the same.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH this Testimony of his Majesty's clearly absolved him from the Guilt, with which he was charged, yet it rather hasten'd the Trial, and sharpen'd the edge, that was before keen enough against him; and the day of Trial being come, when the Members of the Commons, who <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> were appointed for the Prosecution, found that Counsel was ready (which had been assigned by the Lords) for the defence of the Atturney Gene∣ral, they professed, <Q>“”that they would admit no Counsel; that it was be∣low the dignity of the House of Commons to plead against fee'd Coun∣sel; that whoever presumed to be of Counsel with a Person accused by the Commons of <HI>England</HI> should be taught better to know his duty, and should have cause to repent it.</Q> The Lords seem'd much moved with this reproach, that their Acts of Judicature should be questioned, and the Counsel, which had been justly, and regularly assign'd by them, should be threaten'd for submitting to Their Order. But that which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> troubled them most, was, that the Counsel, which was assign'd by them, upon this reprehension, and threat of the Commons, positively refused to meddle further in the business, or to make any Defence for the Attur∣ney. Hereupon, they put off the Trial, and commit to the Tower of
<PB N="380" REF="3980"/>
<HI>London</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Bedingfield,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Gardner,</HI> for their con∣tempt in refusing to be of Counsel with the Atturney upon Their Assign∣ment: standers by looking upon the justice of Parliament with less re∣verence, to see the Subject, between the contradictory, and opposite Commands of both Houses (the displeasure of either being insupporta∣ble) punished and imprisoned for doing, by One, what he was streightly inhibited from doing by the Other.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this difference gave only respite for some days to the At∣turney, who was quickly again called before his Judges. To what was passionately and unreasonably objected against him, <Q>“”of breach of Pri∣viledge <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and Scandal, he confidently alledg'd "the Duty of his place; that his Master's Command was Warrant for what he had done; and that he had been justly punishable if he had refused to do it, when Com∣manded; that there had never been a Pretence of Priviledge in Case of Treason, the contrary whereof was not only understood by the Law, but had been by Themselves confessed, in a Petition delivered by them in the beginning of this King's Reign, upon the imprisonment of the Earl of <HI>Arundel;</HI> in which it was acknowledged, that the Priviledges of Parliament extended not to Treason, Felony, or refusal to find Sure∣ties for the Peace; that he had no reason to suspect the executing the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Duty of his place would have been imputed to him for any Trespass, since the very same thing he had now done, and of which he stood ac∣cused, was done, in the first year of this King's Reign, by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Heath,</HI> the then Atturney General; who exhibited Articles of High-Treason before their Lordships, against the Earl of <HI>Bristol,</HI> which was not then understood to be any breach of Priviledge; and therefore, having so late a Precedent, most of their Lordships being then Judges, he hoped he should be held excusable for not being able to discern that to be a crime, which they had yet never declared to be so. The un∣deniable reasons of his Defence (against which nothing was replied, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> but the inconvenience and mischief, which would attend a Parliament, if the Members might be accused of High-Treason without Their con∣sent)</Q> prevailed so far with the Major part of the House of Peers, tho' the Prosecution was carried on with all imaginable sharpness, and vehe∣mence by the House of Commons, and entertained by those Peers, who were of that Party, as a matter of vast concernment to all their hopes, that the Questions being put, whether he should be deprived of his place of Atturney? whether he should be Fined to the King? whether he should pay Damages to the persons accused? and whether he should be committed to the Tower? which were the several parts of the Sentence, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> which many of the Lords had pressed he should undergo, the Negative prevailed in every one of the Particulars; so that the Atturney was un∣derstood by all men, who understood the Rules and Practice of Parlia∣ment, to be absolutely absolved from that Charge and Impeachment, by the Judgment of the House of Peers.</P>
<P>THE House of Commons expressed all possible resentment, and de∣clared "that they would not rest satisfy'd with the Judgment; and some Lords, even of those who had acquitted him, were very desirous to find out an Expedient, whereby the House of Commons might be com∣pounded with; and it was believed, that the Atturney himself was much <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> shaken with the torrent of Malice and Prejudice, which the House of Commons seem'd now to threaten him with; conceiving, <Q>“”that He and his Office now triumphed over the whole Body, and not over six
<PB N="381" REF="3990"/>
Members only:</Q> and therefore, after some days, the House of Peers considering, <Q>“”that his discharge was but Negative, that he should not be punished in this and that degree; and that he had no Absolution from the crimes,</Q> with which he was charged, proceeded to a new Judgment (contrary to all course and practice of Parliament, or of any Judicial Court) and complying with all their other Votes, Resolved, by way of Judgment upon him, <Q>“”that he should be disabled from ever be∣ing a Parliament Man; incapable of any place of Judicature, or other preferment,</Q> than of Atturney General; which they could not deprive <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> him of, by reason of the former Vote: and <Q>“”that he should be com∣mitted to the Prison of the Fleet.</Q> Which Sentence was with all For∣mality pronounced against him, and he committed to the Fleet ac∣cordingly: with which Sentence the Commons were no more satisfy'd than with the Former; some of them looking that their Favorite, the Sollicitor, should have the place of Atturney; Others, that the accused Members should receive ample Damages by way of reparation; with∣out which they could not think themselves secure from the like At∣tempts.</P>
<P>HAVING, by this extraordinary and exemplary proceeding, fortify'd <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> their Priviledges against such Attempts, and secured their Persons from being accused, or proceeded against by Law, they used no less severity, against all those who presumed to question the justice, or prudence of their Actions, especially against those, who, following the Method that had done so much hurt, drew the people to Petition for that which they had no mind to grant; and in this prosecution they were not less severe, and vehcment, than against the highest Treason could be imagined.</P>
<P>UPON the Petition mentioned before, that was framed in <HI>London</HI> against their setling the Militia, they committed one <HI>George Binion,</HI> a Citizen of great reputation for Wealth and Wisdom, and who was in∣deed <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> a very sober man. After he had lain some time in Prison, the Lords, according to Law, bailed him; but the Commons caused him the next day to be recommitted, and preferr'd an Impeachment against him, for no other crime but "advising and contriving that Petition. The Gen∣tleman defended himself, <Q>“”that it was allways held, and so publickly declared this Parliament, to be Lawful, in a modest way, to Petition for the removal, or prevention of any grievance: that observing very many Petitions to be delivered, and received, for the setling the Mi∣litia, in an other way than was then agreeable to the Law, or had been practiced, and conceiving that the same would prove very preju∣dicial <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to the City of <HI>London,</HI> of which he was a Member, he had joyn'd with many other Citizens, of known ability and integrity, in a Petition against so great an inconvenience; which, he presumed, was lawful for him to do.</Q> How reasonable soever this Defence was, the House of Peers adjudged him <Q>“”to be Disfranchised, and incapable of any Office in the City; to be committed to the Common Goal of <HI>Colchester</HI> (for his reputation was so great in <HI>London,</HI> that they would not trust him in a City Prison)</Q> and Fined him three thousand pounds.</P>
<P>ABOUT the same time, at the General Assizes in <HI>Kent,</HI> the Justices of Peace, and principal Gentlemen of that County, prepared a Petition <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to be presented to the two Houses, with a desire, <Q>“”that the Militia might not be otherwise exercised in that County, than the known Law permitted: and that the Book of Common Prayer, established by Law,</Q> might be observed. This Petition was communicated by many
<PB N="382" REF="4000"/>
to their friends, and Copies thereof sent abroad, before the Subscription was ready; whereupon the House of Peers took notice of it, as tending to some Commotion in <HI>Kent;</HI> and, in the Debate, the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> taking notice, <Q>“”that he had Seen a Copy of it, and had had some con∣ference about it with Judge <HI>Mallet,</HI></Q> who was then Judge of Assize in <HI>Kent,</HI> and newly return'd out of his Circuit, both the Earl and Judge, for having but Seen the Petition, were presently committed to the Tower: and a Declaration published, <Q>“”that none should presume to de∣liver that,</Q> or the like Petition to either House. Notwithstanding which, some Gentlemen of <HI>Kent,</HI> with a great number of the Substan∣tial <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Inhabitants of that County, came to the City; which upon the Alarum, was put in Arms; strong Guards placed at <HI>London▪Bridge,</HI> where the Petitioners were disarmed, and only some few suffered to pass with their Petition to <HI>Westminster;</HI> the rest forced to return to their Country. And, upon the delivery thereof to the House of Com∣mons (tho' the same was very modest, and in a more dutiful Dialect than most Petitions delivered to them) the bringers of the Petition were sharply reprehended; two or three of them committed to several Pri∣sons; the Principal Gentlemen of the Country, who had subscribed and advised it▪ sent for as Delinquents; Charges, and Articles of Impeach∣ment, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> drawn up against them; and a Declaration published, <Q>“”that who∣soever should henceforth advise, or contrive the like Petitions should be proceeded against,</Q> as Enemies to the Common-wealth. So unlike, and different were their tempers, and reception of those modest Ad∣dresses, which were for duty and obedience to the Laws established; and those which pressed, and brought on Alteration and Innovation. But that injustice gave great life, and incouragement to their own Proselytes; and taught Others to know that their being Innocent would not be long Easy or Safe: and this kind of Justice extended it self in the same mea∣sure to their own Members, who opposed their Irregular determina∣tions; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> who, besides the agony and vexation of having the most plain reason, and confessed Law, rejected, and overruled with contempt and noise, were liable to all the Personal reproaches and discountenance, that the Pride and Petulancy of the other Party, could lay upon them; and were sometimes imprisoned and disgraced, for Freely speaking their Opinions, and Conscience in Debate.</P>
<P>ALL sorts of men being thus terrify'd, the Commons remember'd, that a great Magazine of the King's Ammunition lay still at <HI>Hull;</HI> and tho' that Town was in the custody of a Confident of their own, yet they were not willing to venture so great a treasure so near the King, who <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> continued at <HI>York,</HI> with a great resort of Persons of Honour and Quality from all parts; and therefore they resolved, under pretence of supply∣ing <HI>Ireland,</HI> to remove it speedily from thence; and moved the Lords, to joyn with them in an Order to that purpose. The Lords, who pro∣ceeded with less Fury, and more Formality, desired <Q>“”that it might be done with the King's consent.</Q> After a long Debate, the one thinking they merited much by that Civility, the other contented to gratify those in the Ceremony, who, they knew, would in the end concur with them, a Petition was agreed upon to be sent to his Majesty; in which, that he might the sooner yield to them in this matter, they resolved to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> remember him of that, which, they thought, would reflect on him with the People, and to <Q>“”move him to take off the Reprieve from the six Priests, which is before mentioned.</Q> And so they sent their Petition
<PB N="383" REF="4010"/>
to him, telling him, <Q>“”that they found the Stores of Arms, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Petition from the two Houses to re∣move the Ma∣gazine from <HI>Hull.</HI></NOTE> in the Tower of <HI>London</HI> much dimmished; and that the ne∣cessity for supply of his Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> (for which they had been issued from thence) daily increased; and that the occasion, for which the Magazine was placed at <HI>Hull,</HI> was now taken away; and consi∣dering it would be kept at <HI>London</HI> with less charge, and more safety, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ansported thence with much more convenience for the service of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> they therefore humbly prayed, that his Ma∣jesty would be graciously pleased to give leave, that the said Armes, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Cannon, and Ammunition, now in the Magazine of <HI>Hull,</HI> might be removed to the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> according as should be directed by both his Houses of Parliament: And whereas six Priests, then in <HI>New∣gate,</HI> were condemn'd to dye, and by his Majesty had been reprieved▪ they humbly prayed his Majesty to be pleased, that the said Reprieves might be taken off,</Q> and the Priests executed according to Law. To which Petition his Majesty immediately returned Answer in these words:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty's Answer.</NOTE> <Q>“”WE rather expected, and have done long, that You should have given Us an Account, why a Garrison hath been placed in Our Town <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of <HI>Hull,</HI> without our Consent, and Soldiers billeted there against Law, and express words of the Petition of Right, than to be moved, for the avoiding of a needless charge you have put upon your selves, to give Our Consent for the removal of Our Magazine and Munition, Our own proper Goods, upon such General reasons as indeed give no satisfaction to Our Judgment: And since you have made the business of <HI>Hull</HI> your Argument, We would gladly be informed, why our own inclination, on the general rumour of the designs of Papists in the Northern Parts, was not thought sufficient ground for us to put a Per∣son of Honour, Fortune, and unblemished Reputation, into a Town <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and Fort of Our own, where Our own Magazine lay: and yet the same rumour be Warrant enough for You to commit the same Town and Fort, without Our Consent, to the hands of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> with a power unagreeable to the Law of the Land, or the Liberty of the Subject.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND yet of this, in point of Right, or Priviledge, for sure We are not without Priviledge too, We have not all this while complained: and being confident that the place, whatsoever discourse there is of Publick or Private instructions to the contrary, shall be speedily given up▪ if We shall require it, We shall be contented to dispose our Mu∣nition <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> there, as We have done in other places, for the publick ease and benefit, as, upon particular advice, We shall find convenient; tho' we cannot think it fit, or consent, that the whole Magazine be re∣moved together. But when you shall agree upon such proportions, as shall be held necessary for any particular service, We shall sign such Warrants as shall be agreeable to Wisdom and Reason; and if any of them be designed for <HI>Ulster,</HI> or <HI>Lemster,</HI> you know well the con∣veyance will be more easy, and convenient from the place they are Now in. Yet we must tell you, that if the fears are so great from the Papists at home, or of Forreign Force, as is pretended, it seems strange <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that you make not provision of Armes, and Munition for defence of this Kingdom, rather than seek to carry any more from hence, with∣out some course taken for supply; especially, if you remember your engagement to Our <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects, for that proportion of Armes,
<PB N="384" REF="4020"/>
which is conteined in your Treaty. We speak not this, as not thinking the sending of Armes to <HI>Ireland</HI> very necessary, but only for the Way of the provision. For You know what great quantities We have As∣signed out of Our several Stores, which, in due time, We hope, You will see replenished. For the Charge of looking to the Magazine at <HI>Hull,</HI> as it was undertaken Voluntarily by You at first, and, to say no more, Unnecessarily; so You may free Our good People of that Charge and leave it to Us to look to,</Q> who are the proper Owner of it. And this, We hope, will give you full satisfaction in this point, <Q>and “”that Ye do not, as you have done in the business of the Militia, send <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> this Message out of Complement and Ceremony, resolving to be your Own Carvers at last. For We must tell you, if any attempt shall be made or given in this matter, without Our Consent or Approbation, We shall esteem it as an Act of Violence against Us; and declare it to all the world, as the greatest Violation of Our Right, and breach of Our Priviledge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”CONCERNING the six Priests condemn'd, it is true, they were re∣prieved by Our Warrant, We being informed that they were, by some restraint, disabled to take the benefit of Our former Proclamation; since that, We have issued out another, for the due execution of the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Laws against Papists; and have most solemnly promised, in the word of a King, never to pardon any Priest, without Your consent, which should be found guilty by Law; desiring to banish these, having here∣with sent Warrant to that purpose, if, upon second thoughts, You do not disapprove thereof. But if You think the Execution of these per∣sons so very necessary to the great, and pious work of Reformation, We refer it wholely to You; declaring hereby, that upon such Your Resolution signify'd to the Ministers of Justice, Our Warrant for their Reprieve is determined, and the Law to have the course. And now let Us ask you (for we are willing to husband time, and to dispatch as <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> much as may be under One Message; God knows the distractions of this Kingdom want a Present remedy) will there Never be a time to Offer to, as well as to Ask of Us? We will propose no more particu∣lars to you, having no luck to please, or to be understood by you; take your own time for what concerns Our particular: but be sure you have an early, speedy care of the Publick; that is, of the only Rule that preserves the Publick, the Law of the Land; preserve the dignity and reverence due to That. It was well said in a Speech, made by a pri∣vate person; it was M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI>▪s Speech against the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> but published by Order of the House of Commons this Parliament: the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Law is that, which puts a difference betwixt Good and Evil, betwixt Just and Unjust. If you take away the Law, all things will fall into a confusion, every man will become a Law unto himself; which, in the depraved condition of Human Nature, must needs produce many great enormities. Lust will become a Law, and envy will become a Law; Covetousness and Ambition will become Laws; and what dictates, what decisions, such Laws will produce, may easily be discerned. So said that Gentleman, and much more, very well, in defence of the Law, and against Arbitrary Power. It is worth looking over, and considering: and if the most zealous defence of the true Protestant <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> profession, and the most resolved protection of the Law, be the most necessary duty of a Prince, We cannot believe this miserable distance, and misunderstanding, can be long continued between us; We having
<PB N="385" REF="4030"/>
often, and earnestly declared them to be the chiefest desires of Our Soul, and the End and Rule of all Our Actions. For <HI>Ireland,</HI> We have suffi∣ciently, and we hope satisfactorily, expressed to all Our good Subjects Our hearty sense of that sad business, in Our several Messages on that Argument, but especially in Our last of the eighth of this Month, con∣cerning Our Resolution for that Service; for the Speedy, Honourable, and Full performance whereof, We conjure You to yield all possible assistance,</Q> and Present advice.</P>
<P>THIS Answer was received with the usual circumstances of trouble <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and discontent, the taxing of evil Counsellors, and Malignant persons about the King; and that Clause about the condemn'd Priests exceed∣ingly displeased them; for by the King's reference of the matter en∣tirely to Them, he had removed the scandal from Himself, and laid it at Their doors; and tho' they were well content, and desirous, that they should have been Executed by the King's Warrant for taking off his own Reprieve (whereby they should have made him retract an Act of his Own Mercy, and undeniably within his own Power; and thereby have les<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ened much of the Devotion of that People to him, when they should have seen him quit his power of preserving them in the least degree) <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> yet, for many reasons, they were not willing to take that harsh part upon Themselves; and so those condemn'd Priests were no more prose∣cuted, and were much safer under that Reference for their execution, than they could have been, at that time, by a Pardon under the Great Seal of <HI>England.</HI> For the other part of the Answer concerning the Ma∣gazine, it made no pause with them; but within few day's after, they sent a Warrant to their own Governour. S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> to deliver it; and to their own Admiral, the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> to transport it to <HI>Lon∣don;</HI> which was, notwithstanding the King's inhibition, done accord∣ingly. But they had at that time another Message from the King, which <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> was referr'd to in the last Clause of that Answer, and came to their hands some few days before, that gave them some serious trouble and apprehension; the grounds and reasons of which were these:</P>
<P>"THE King finding, that notwithstanding all the professions, and pro∣testations he could make, the business of <HI>Ireland</HI> was still unreasonably objected to him, as if he were not cordial in the suppressing that Rebel∣lion, sent a Message to both Houses:</P>
<P><Q>“”THAT being grieved at the very Soul for the calamities of his good<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty's Message to both Houses, <HI>Apr. 8. 1642.</HI> offering to go in person into <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> Subjects of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and being most tenderly sensible of the false, and scandalous reports dispersed amongst the People concerning the Re∣bellion <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> there; which not only wounded his Majesty in Honour, but likewise greatly retarded the reducing that unhappy Kingdom, and multiply'd the distractions at Home, by weakning the mutual confi∣dence between him, and his People: out of his pious Zeal to the Ho∣nour of Allmighty God, in establishing the true Protestant profession in that Kingdom, and his Princely care for the good of all his Domi∣nions, he had firmly resolved to go with all convenient speed into <HI>Ireland,</HI> to chastise those wicked and detestable Rebels, odious to God, and all good men; thereby so to settle the Peace of That Kingdom, and the security of This, that the very Name of Fears and Jealousies <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> might be no more heard of amongst them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND He said, as he doubted not, but his Parliament would chear∣fully give all possible Assistance to this good Work, so he required them, and all his loving Subjects, to believe, that he would, upon

those considerations, as earnestly Pursue that design, not declining any hazard of his Person in performing that duty, which he owed to the defence of God's true Religion, and his distressed Subjects, as he Undertook it for those only ends; to the sincerity of which profession, he called God to Witness, with this further assurance, that he would never consent, upon whatsoever pretence, to a Toleration of the Po∣pish profession there, or the abolition of the Laws now in force against Popish Recusants in that Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty further advertised them, that, towards this work, he intended to raise forthwith, by his Commissions, in the Counties near <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <HI>West-Chester,</HI> a Guard for his own Person (when he should come into <HI>Ireland</HI> consisting of two thousand Foot, and two hundred Horse, which should be armed at <HI>West-Chester,</HI> from his Magazine at <HI>Hull;</HI> at which time, he said, all the Officers, and Soldiers, should take the Oaths of Supremacy, and Allegiance; the Charge of raising and pay∣ing whereof, he desired the Parliament to add to their former under∣takings for that War; which he would not only well accept, but, if their Pay should be found too great a burthen to his good Subjects, he would be willing, by the advice of his Parliament, to sell, or pawn, any of his Parks, Lands, or Houses, towards the supplies of the ser∣vice <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of <HI>Ireland.</HI> With the addition of these Levies to the former of English, and Scots, agreed upon in Parliament, he said, he hoped so to appear in that Action, that by the Assistance of Allmighty God, that Kingdom, in a short time, might be wholely reduced, and re∣stored to peace, and some measure of happiness; whereby he might chearfully return, to be welcomed home with the affections, and blessings of all his good English People.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”TOWARDS this good work, he said, as he had lately made dispatches into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to quicken the Levies there for <HI>Ulster,</HI> so he heartily wished, that his Parliament would give all possible expedition to those, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> which they had resolved for <HI>Munster</HI> and <HI>Canaught;</HI> and hoped the encouragement, which the Adventurers, of whose interests he would be allways very careful, would hereby receive, would raise full sums of money for the doing thereof. He told them, that out of his earnest desire to remove all occasions, which did unhappily multiply misun∣derstandings between him and his Parliament, he had likewise pre∣pared a Bill to be offer'd to them by his Atturney concerning the Mi∣litia; whereby, he hoped, the peace and safety of the Kingdom might be fully secured to the general satisfaction of all men, without Vio∣lation of his Majesty's Just Rights, or prejudice to the Liberty of the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Subject. If this should be thankfully received, he said, he should be glad of it; if refused, he must call God, and all the world, to judge on Whose part the default was; only he required, if the Bill should be approved of, that if any Corporations should make their Lawful Rights appear, they might be reserved to them. He said, before he would part from <HI>England,</HI> he would take all due care to entrust such Persons with such Authority in his absence, as he should find to be requisite for the peace and safety of the Kingdom, and the happy pro∣gress of the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>THEY neither before nor after ever received any Message from his <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Majesty, that more discomposed them; and so much the more, because that which gave them most Umbrage, could not be publickly and safely avowed by them. For tho', to those who had a due reverence to the
<PB N="387" REF="4050"/>
King's Person, and an impatient desire, that all misunderstandings might be composed, they urged <Q>“”the hazard, and danger to his Majesty's Per∣son, in such an expedition, and the increase of jealousies and distractions, that would ensue in this Kingdom by his Absence;</Q> and to others, who from the barbarity, inhumanity, and unheard of cruelty, exercised by the Rebels in <HI>Ireland</HI> upon the English Protestants (of which they every day received fresh and bleeding evidence) had contracted a great animo∣sity against that whole Nation, and were perswaded that the work of extirpation was not so difficult as intruth it was; and to the Adven∣turers, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> who had disbursed great sums of money, and had disgested a full Assurance of Ample recompence by Confiscations, and Forfeitures; <Q>“”that by this Voyage of the King, a Peace would be in a short time concluded in that Kingdom,</Q> to their great disadvantage and damage; yet the true Reasons, which surprised and startled them, were, that hereby the managing the War of <HI>Ireland</HI> would be taken out of their hands; and so, instead of having a Nursery for Soldiers of their Own, which they might imploy as they saw occasion; and a power of raising what money they pleased in this Kingdom under that title, which they might dispose, as they found most fit for their affairs; the King would <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> probably in a short time recover One entire Kingdom to his obedience, by which he might be able to preserve the peace of the Other Two. However, working by several impressions upon several Affections, they found it no difficult thing to perswade, allmost an Unanimous, aversion from approving the Journey; they who usually opposed their advice, not enduring to think of staying in <HI>England,</HI> where the power, at least for a time, would be in Them, whose Government, they knew, would be terrible when his Majesty should be in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Upon this they dispatched a Magisterial Answer to the King, in which they told him;</P>
<P><Q>“”THAT the Lords and Commons in Parliament, had duly considered<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Answer of both Houses to his Ma∣jesty's Message of his going in Person into <HI>Ireland, Apr. 28. 1642.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Message, received from his Majesty, concerning his purpose of go∣ing into <HI>Ireland</HI> in his Own Person to prosecute the War there, with the bodies of his English Subjects, levied, transported, and maintained at their Charge; which he was pleased to propound to them, not as a matter wherein he desired the advice of his Parliament, but as all∣ready firmly resolved on, and forthwith to be put in execution, by granting out Commissions for the levying of two thousand Foot, and two hundred Horse, for a Guard for his Person when he should come into that Kingdom; wherein, they said, they could not but, with all reverence and humility to his Majesty, observe, that he had declined <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> his Great Council, the Parliament, and varied from the usual Course of his Royal Predecessours; that a business of so great importance con∣cerning the Peace, and Safety of all his Subjects, and wherein they have a special interest, by his Majesty's promise, and by those great sums, which they had disbursed, and for which they stood engaged, should be concluded, and undertaken without their advice: where∣upon, they said, they held it their duty to declare, that if, at that time, his Majesty should go into <HI>Ireland,</HI> he would very much endanger the safety of his Royal Person, and Kingdoms, and of all other States pro∣fessing the Protestant Religion in <HI>Christendom,</HI> and make way to the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> execution of that cruel, and bloody design of the Papists, every where to root out and destroy the Reformed Religion; as the Irish Papists had allready, in a great part, effected in that Kingdom; and, in all likelyhood, would quickly be attempted in other places, if the consi∣deration
<PB N="388" REF="4060"/>
of the strength, and union of the two Nations of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> did not much hinder, and discourage the execution of any such design. And that they might manifest to his Majesty the danger and misery, which such a journey and enterprise would pro∣duce, they presented to his Majesty the reasons of that their humble opinion and advice:</Q></P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>“”HIS Royal Person would be subject, not only to the casualty of War, but to secret Practices and Conspiracies; especially his Majesty continuing his profession to maintain the Protestant Religion in that Kingdom, which the Papists were generally bound by their vow to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> extirpate.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>“”IT would exceedingly encourage the Rebels; who did generally profess and declare, that his Majesty did favour and allow their pro∣ceedings, and that this Insurrection was undertaken by the Warrant of his Commission; and it would make good their expectation of great advantage, by his Majesty's presence at that time, of so much distraction in his Kingdom, whereby they might hope the two Houses of Par∣liament would be disabled to supply the War there, especially there appearing less necessity of his Majesty's Journey at that time, by rea∣son of the manifold successes,</Q> which God had given against them. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>“”IT would much hinder, and impair the means whereby the War was to be supported, and increase the Charge of it, and in both these respects make it more insupportable to the Subject; and this, they said, they could confidently affirm; because many of the Adven∣turers, who had allready subscribed, did, upon the knowledge of his Majesty▪s intention, declare their resolution not to pay in their money; and others, very willing to have subscribed, do Now profess the con∣trary.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. <Q>“”HIS Majesty's absence must necessarily very much interrupt the proceedings of Parliament; and deprive his Subjects of the benefit of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> those further Acts of Grace and Justice, which they should humbly expect from his Majesty for the establishing a perfect Union, and mu∣tual Confidence between his Majesty and his People, and procuring, and confirming the prosperity,</Q> and happiness of both.</P>
<P N="5">5. <Q>“”IT would exceedingly increase the Fears and Jealousies of his People; and render their Doubts more probable, of some Force in∣tended, by some evil Counsels near his Majesty, in opposition of the Parliament,</Q> and favour of the Malignant Party of this Kingdom.</P>
<P N="6">6. <Q>“”IT would bereave his Parliament of that advantage, whereby they were induced to undertake that War, upon his Majesty's promise <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that it should be managed by Their advice; which could not be done, if his Majesty▪ contrary to their Counsels, should undertake to order, and govern it in his own Person.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”UPON which, and divers other reasons, they said, they had Re∣solved, by the full and concurrent Agreement of both Houses, that they could not, with discharge of their duty, consent to any Levies or raising of Soldiers to be made by his Majesty, for that his intended expedition into <HI>Ireland;</HI> or to the payment of any Army, or Soldiers there, but such as should be imployed, and governed according to their advice, and direction: and that, if such Levies should be made by any <MILESTONE N="$0" UNIT="line"/> Commission of his Majesty's, not agreed to by both Houses of Parlia∣ment, they should be forced to interpret the same to be raised to the Terrour of his People, and Disturbance of the Publick Peace; and
<PB N="389" REF="4070"/>
did hold themselves bound, by the Laws of the Kingdom, to apply the Authority of Parliament to suppress the same.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND, they said, they did further most humbly declare, that if his Majesty should by ill Counsel be perswaded to go, contrary to that advice of his Parliament (which they hoped his Majesty would not) they did not, in that case, hold themselves bound to submit to any Commissioners, which his Majesty should choose; but did Resolve to Preserve and Govern the Kingdom, by the Counsel and Advice of Par∣liament, for his Majesty and his Posterity, according to their Alle∣giance, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and the Law of the Land: wherefore, they did most humbly pray, and advise his Majesty, to desist from that his intended passage into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from all preparation of Men and Armes tending thereunto; and to leave the managing of that War to his Parliament, according to his promise made unto them, and his Commission granted under his Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> by advice of both Houses; in pro∣secution whereof, by God's blessing, they had allready made a pro∣sperous entrance, by many defeats of the Rebels, whereby they were much weakned and disheartned; and had no probable means of sub∣sistence, if the proceedings of the two Houses were not interrupted by <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that interposition of his Majesty's Journey: but they hoped, upon good grounds, that, within a short time, without hazard of his Person, and so much dangerous confusion in his Kingdoms, which must needs en∣sue, if he should proceed in that resolution, they should be enabled fully to vindicate his Majesty's Right, and Authority in that Kingdom; and punish those horrible, outragious cruelties, which had been com∣mitted in the murthering, and spoiling so many of his Subjects; and to bring that Realm to such a condition, as might be much to the Ad∣vantage of his Majesty and the Crown, and the Honour of his Go∣vernment, and Contentment of his People: for the better and more <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> speedy effecting whereof, they did again renew their humble desires of his return to his Parliament; and that he would please to reject all Counsels, and Apprehensions, which might any way derogate from that faithfulness, and Allegiance, which, in truth and sincerity, they had allways born and professed to his Majesty, and should ever make good,</Q> to the uttermost, with their Lives and Fortunes.</P>
<P>TO this Petition (the Matter whereof finding a general concurrence, there was the less debate, and contradiction upon the Manner of expres∣sion) being sent to the King to <HI>York;</HI> and, in the mean time, all prepa∣rations being suspended for the necessary relief for <HI>Ireland,</HI> insomuch as <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> with the Votes (which were presently printed) against the King's Jour∣ney▪ there was likewise an Order printed to discourage the Adventurers from bringing in their Money; the which, tho' it had no approbation from either House, and seem'd to be angrily interpreted by them, and the Printer was order'd to be found out and punished, yet did wholely stop that Service; and by the no▪enquiry, or punishment of that bold∣ness, appear'd to be done by design) his Majesty speedily returned this Answer.</P>
<P><Q>“”THAT he was so troubled, and astonished to find that unexpected<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King s Reply touching his going into <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> reception, and misunderstanding of his Message concerning his Irish <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Journey, that (being so much disappointed of the Approbation, and thanks he looked for to that Declaration) he had great cause to doubt, whether it were in his power, to Say, or Do any thing, which would not fall within the like interpretation: but he said, as he had, in that
<PB N="390" REF="4080"/>
Message, called God to Witness the sincerity of the profession of his only ends for the undertaking that Journey; so he must Appeal to all his good Subjects, and the whole world, whether the reasons alledged against that Journey, were of Weight to satisfy his understanding; or the Counsel, presented to disswade him from it, were full of that Duty, as was like to prevail over his Affections. For the resolving of so great a business without the Advice of his Parliament, he said, he must remember them, how often, by his Message, he made the same offer, if They should advise him thereunto; to which they never gave him the least Answer; but, in their late Declaration, told him, that they <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> were not to be satisfy'd with Words: so that he had reason to conceive, they rather avoided, out of regard to his Person, to give him Counsel to run that hazard, than that they disapproved the inclination. And, he asked them, what greater comfort, or security the Protestants of <HI>Christendom</HI> could receive, than by seeing a Protestant King venture, and engage his Person for the Defence of That Religion, and the Sup∣pression of Popery? to which he solemnly protested, in that Message, never to grant a Toleration, upon what pretence soever, or any abo∣lition of any of the Laws There in force against the Professours of it. And, he said, when he considered the great calamities, and unheard of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> cruelties, his poor Protestant Subjects in that Kingdom had undergone for the space of near, or full six Months; the growth and increase of the strength of those barbarous Rebels; and the evident probability of forreign supplies, if they were not speedily suppressed; the very slow succours hitherto sent them from hence: that the Officers of several Regiments, who had long time been allowed entertainment from them for that Service, had not raised any supply, or succour for that King∣dom; that many Troops of Horse had long lain near <HI>Chester</HI> un∣transported; that the Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> on whom he relied principally for the conduct, and managing of Affairs there, was still in <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> this Kingdom, notwithstanding his Majesty's earnestness expressed, that he should repair to his Command: and when he consider'd the many and great scandals raised upon himself by report of the Rebels, and not sufficiently discountenanced Here, notwithstanding so many pro∣fessions of his Majesty; and had seen a Book, lately printed by the Order of the House of Commons, entituled a Remonstrance of divers remarkable passages concerning the Church and Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> wherein some Examinations were set down (how improbable or im∣possible soever) which might make an impression in the minds of many of his weak Subjects: And lastly, when he had duely weighed <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the dishonour that would perpetually lie upon this Kingdom, if full and speedy relief were not dispatched thither; his Majesty could not think of a better way to discharge his Duty to Allmighty God, for the defence of the true Protestant Religion, or to manifest his Affection to his three Kingdoms, for their preservation, than by engaging his Per∣son in that expedition, as many of his Royal Progenitors had done, even in Forreign Parts, upon causes of Less importance and piety, with great Honour to themselves, and Advantage to this Kingdom. And therefore,</Q> he expected at least Thanks for such his inclination.</P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the danger to his Person, he said, he conceived it necessary, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and worthy of a King, to adventure his Life to preserve his Kingdoms; neither could it be imagined that he would sit still, and suffer his King∣doms to be lost, and his good Protestant Subjects to be Massacre'd,
<PB N="391" REF="4090"/>
without exposing his own Person to the utmost hazard for their relief and preservation; his life, when it was most pleasant, being nothing so precious to him, as it was, and should be, to govern and preserve his People with Honour,</Q> and Justice.</P>
<P><Q>“”FOR any encouragement to the Rebels, because of the Reports they raised, he said, he could not conceive, that the Rebels were capable of a greater terrour, than by the Presence of their Lawful King, in the head of an Army, to chastise them. Besides, it would be an unspeakable advantage to them, if any report of Theirs could hinder him from do∣ing <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> any thing, which were fit for him to do, if such report were not raised: that would quickly teach them, in this Jealous age, to pre∣vent, by such reports, any other Persons coming against them, whom they had no mind should be imploy'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE told them, that he marvelled, that the Adventurers, whose advantage was a principal motive (next the reasons before mentioned) to him, should so much mistake his purpose; whose interest he con∣ceived must be much improved by the expedition he hoped, by God's blessing, to use in that Service; that being the most probable way for the speedy Conquest of the Rebels, their Lands were sufficiently se∣cured <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> by Act of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE told them, he thought himself not kindly used, that the addi∣tion of so few Men to their Levies (for a Guard to his Person in <HI>Ire∣land)</HI> should be thought fit for their refusal; and much more, that having used so many cautions in that Message, both in the smalness of the number; in his having raised none, untill their Answer; in their being to be raised only near the place of shipping; in their being There to be armed, and that not till they were ready to be shipp'd; in the provision, by the Oaths, that none of them should be Papists (all which were sufficient to destroy all grounds of Jealousy of any Force intended <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> by them in opposition to the Parliament, or favour to any Malignant Party) any Suspicion should,</Q> notwithstanding, be grounded upon it.</P>
<P><Q>“”NEITHER, he said, could it be understood, that when he recom∣mended the managing of that War to Them, he intended to exclude Himself, or not to be concerned in their Counsels, that if he found any Expedient (which, in his conscience and understanding, he thought necessary for that great work) he might not put it in practice. He told them, he looked upon them as his great Council, whose advice he allways had, and would, with great regard and deliberation, weigh and consider: but he looked upon himself as neither deprived of his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Understanding, or devested of any Right he had, if there were no Par∣liament sitting. He said, he called them together, by his own Writ and Authority (without which they could not have met) to give him faithful Counsel about his Great Affairs; but he resigned not up his own Interest, and Freedom; he never subjected himself to Their ab∣solute Determination; He had allways weighed their Counsels, as pro∣ceeding from a Body intrusted by him; and when he had dissented from them, he had returned them the reasons, which had prevailed with his conscience and understanding, with that Candour, which a Prince should use towards his Subjects; and that Affection, which a Fa∣ther <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> could express to his Children. What application had been used to rectify his Understanding by Reasons, or what Motives had been given to perswade his Affections, he would leave all the world to judge. And then, he said, he must tell them, howsoever a Major part
<PB N="392" REF="4100"/>
might bind Them in matter of opinion, he held Himself (and he was sure the Law and Constitution of the Kingdom had allways held the same) as free to dissent, till his Reason was convinced, for the Gene∣ral Good,</Q> as if they had delivered No opinion.</P>
<P><Q>“”FOR his Journey it self, he told them the circumstances of their Petition were such, as he knew not well what Answer to return, or whether he were best to give Any; that part which pretended to carry Reason with it, did no way satisfy him; the Other, which was rather Reprehension and Menace, than Advice, could not stagger him. His Answer therefore was, that he should be very glad to find the work of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Ireland</HI> so easy, as they seem'd to think it; which did not so appear by any thing known to him, when he sent his Message: and tho' he would never refuse, or be unwilling, to venture his Person, for the Good and Safety of his People, he was not so weary of his life, as to hazard it Impertinently; and therefore, since they seem'd to have re∣ceived Advertisements of some late, and great successes in that King∣dom, he would stay some time to see the event of those, and not pur∣sue his resolution till he had given them a Second notice: but, if he found the miserable condition of his poor Subjects of that Kingdom were not speedily relieved, he would, with God's Assistance, visit them <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> with such Succours, as his Particular credit and interest could supply him with, if They refused to Joyn with him. And he doubted not but the Levies he should make (in which he would observe punctually the former, and all other cautions, as might best prevent all Fears and Jealousies; and to use no Power but what was Legal) would be so much to the satisfaction of his Subjects, as no person would dare pre∣sume to resist his Commands; and if they should, at their Peril be it. In the mean time, he hoped his forwardness, so remarkable to that Service, should be notorious to all the world; and that all scandals, laid on him in that business,</Q> should be clearly wiped away. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P><Q>“”HE told them▪ he had been so careful that his Journey into <HI>Ireland</HI> should not interrupt the proceedings of Parliament, nor deprive his Subjects of any Acts of Justice, or further Acts of Grace for the real benefit of his People, that he had made a free offer of leaving such power behind▪ as should not only be necessary for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom, but fully provide for the happy progress of the Par∣liament: and therefore he could not but wonder, since such power had been allways left here, by Commission, for the Government of this Kingdom, when his Progenitors had been out of the same, during the sitting of Parliaments; and since Themselves desired that such a <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> power might be left here by his Majesty, at his last going into <HI>Scotland;</HI> what Law of the Land they had now found to dispence with them from submitting to such Authority, legally derived from him, in his absence; and to enable them to govern the Kingdom by their Own meer Authority.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR his return to <HI>London,</HI> he said, he had given them so full An∣swers in his late Declaration, and Answers that he knew not what to add to, if they would not provide for his security with them, nor agree to remove to another place, where there might not be the same dan∣ger to his Majesty. He told them, he expected, that (since he had <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> been so particular in the causes and grounds of his Fears▪ they should have sent him word, that they had published such Declarations against future Tumults and unlawful Assemblies, and taken such Courses for
<PB N="393" REF="4110"/>
the suppressing seditious Pamphlets and Sermons, that his Fears of that kind might be laid aside,</Q> before they should press his return.</P>
<P><Q>“”TO conclude, he told them, he could wish, that they would, with the same strictness and severity, weigh and examin their Messages, and Expressions To him, as they did those they received From him. For he was very confident, that if they examined his Rights and Privi∣ledges, by what His Predecessors had enjoyed; and their own Ad∣dresses, by the usual courses observed by Their Ancestors; they would find many expressions in that Petition, warranted only by their own <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Authority; which indeed he forbore to take notice of, or to give An∣swer to, lest he should be tempted, in a just indignation, to express a greater passion, than he was Yet willing to put on. God in his good time, he hoped, would so inform the hearts of all his Subjects, that he should recover from the mischief, and danger of that distemper; on whose good pleasure, he said, he would wait with all patience, and humility.</Q></P>
<P>FROM this time the purpose was never resumed of his Majesty's per∣sonal expedition into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and so They were freed from That ap∣prehension. The truth is, that Counsel for his Majesty's Journey into <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Ireland</HI> was very suddainly taken, and communicated to very few, with∣out consideration of the objections, that would naturally arise against it; and was rather resolved as a probable Stratagem, to compose the two Houses to a better temper and sobriety, upon the Apprehension of the King's absence from them, and the inconveniencies that might thence ensue, than sufficiently consider'd and digested for Execution. For none were more violent against it than they who served the King most faith∣fully in the Houses; who, in the King's absence, and after such a Grant of the Militia, as was then offer'd, looked upon themselves as sacrificed to the pride and fury of those, whose inclinations, and temper had be∣got <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Confusions they complained of. But if it had been so duely weighed and consulted, and Men so disposed, that it might have been Executed, and the King had taken a fit Council, and Retinue about him, it would, at that time, have been no hard matter speedily to have reduced <HI>Ireland;</HI> and by the reputation, and authority of That, the other two Kingdoms might have been contained within their proper bounds. But, as it fell out, the Overture proved Disadvantageous to the King, and gave the other Party New cause of Triumph, that they had plainly Threaten'd him out of what He pretended to have firmly resolved to do; which disadvantage was improved by the Other Propo∣sition, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that attended it, concerning the Militia. For the Bill, sent by the King upon that Argument, brought the business again into Debate; and, tho▪ nothing was concluded upon it, the King was a looser by the Proposition, tho' not so much as he fear'd he should have been, when he saw his Journey into <HI>Ireland</HI> desperate; upon the supposition of which, he had only made that tender.</P>
<P>THE Bill sent by the King, and preferred to the House of Peers, by the Atturney General, granted the Militia, for one year, to the persons first nominated by the Houses in their Ordinances to his Majesty; and made those persons, in the Execution of that Trust, subject to the Au∣thority <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of his Majesty, and the two Houses Jointly, whilst his Ma∣jesty was within the Kingdom; and, in his absence, of the two Houses Only. What alterations, and amendments they made in it before they returned it again for the Royal Assent, will best appear by the King's
<PB N="394" REF="4120"/>
Answer, which he sent to them at the time of his refusal to pass it; which was,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> <Q>“”THAT he had, with great deliberation and patience, weighed and considered (as it concerned him much to weigh the consequences of every Law before he passed it) their Bill lately sent to him for the setling the Militia; and tho▪ it had not been usual to give any reason for the refusal to pass any Bill, it being absolutely in his power to pass, or not to pass any Act sent to him, if he conceived it prejudicial to him∣helf, or inconvenient to his Subjects, for whom he was trusted, and must one day give an account; yet, in that business of the Militia, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> which, being misunderstood amongst his good Subjects, had been used as an Argument, as if he were not Vigilant enough for the publick safety, and lest he should be thought less Constant in his resolutions, and that Bill to be the same he had sent to them, he thought fit to give them, and all the world particular satisfaction, why he could not, Ought not, Must not pass That Bill, being the first publick Bill he had refused this Parliament: and therefore, he told them, he must com∣plain, that having expressed himself so clearly and particularly to them in that point, they should press any thing upon him, which they could not but foresee he must refuse; except he departed from those <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> resolutions, grounded upon so much reason, he had so earnestly before acquainted them with, and against which they had not given one Ar∣gument to satisfy his judgment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE told them, he was pleased, they had declined the Unwarranta∣ble course of their Ordinance (to the which, he was confident, his good Subjects would never have yielded their consent) and chosen that only right way of imposing upon the People, which he would have allowed but for the reasons following:</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, he had refused to consent to their Ordinance, as for other things, so for that the power was put into the persons Nominated <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> therein by direction of both Houses of Parliament, excluding his Ma∣jesty from any power in the disposition, or execution of it together with them: He had then advised them, for many reasons, that a Bill should be prepared; and after in his Answer of the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI> to the Petition of both Houses, he had told them, if such a Bill should be prepared with that due regard to his Majesty, and care of his People, in the limitation of the power, and other circumstances, he should recede from nothing he formerly expressed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WHAT passed (enough to have discouraged him from being further Sollicitous in that Argument) after his full, and gracious Answers, he <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> was content to forge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. When he resolved on his Journey into <HI>Ireland,</HI> so that by reason of his absence, there might be no want of settling that power; besides complying with their fears; he sent, together with a Message of that his purpose, a Bill for settling the power for a year; hoping in that time to return to them, and being sure that, in much less time, they might do the business, for which at first they seem'd to desire this; which was, that they might securely consider his Message of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>January</HI> last. By that Bill, which he sent, he consented to those Names they proposed to their Ordinance, and in the limitation of the power; provided, that himself should not be able <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to execute any thing but by their advice; and, when he should be out of the Kingdom, the Sole execution to be in them; with many other things, of so Arbitrary, and Uncircumscribed a power, that he should
<PB N="395" REF="4130"/>
not have consented to, but with reference to the absence of his own Person out of the Kingdom; and thought it the more sufferable, in respect the time was but for a year. Whether that Bill, they had sent to him to pass, were the same,</Q> the world would judge.</P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, they had, by that Bill tender'd to his Majesty, without taking notice of him, put the Power of the whole Kingdom, the Life and Liberties of the Subjects of all degrees, and qualities, into the hands of Particular Men, for two years: He asked them, if they could ima∣gin he would trust such an Absolute power in the hands of Particular <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Persons, which he had refused to commit to both Houses of Parlia∣ment? Nay, if the Power it self were not too Absolute, too Unlimited to be committed into any Private hands? Whether S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s high insolence shewed him not, what he might expect from an Exor∣bitant legal power, when he, by a power not warrantable by Law, durst venture upon a Treasonable disobedience? but his Majesty would willingly know, and indeed such an account in ordinary civility, he said, he might have expected, why he was, by that Act, absolutely Excluded, from any Power, or Authority in the Execution of the Mi∣litia. He said, sure their Fears and Jealousies were not of such a Na∣ture, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> as were capable of no other remedy, than by leaving him No power in a point of the greatest importance; in which God, and the Law, had trusted him Solely, and which he had been contented to Share with them by his own Bill, by putting It, and a Greater, into the hands of particular Subjects. He asked them, what all Christian Princes would think of him, after he had passed such a Bill▪ How they would value his Soveraignty? And yet, he said, sure His Reputation with Forreign Princes was some ground of Their Security. Nay, he was confident, by that time they had throughly consider'd the possible consequence of that Bill, upon Themselves, and the rest of his good <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Subjects, they would All give him Thanks for Not consenting to it; finding their condition, if it should have passed, would not have been so pleasing to them. He told them, he hoped that Animadversion would be no breach of their Priviledges. In that throng of business and distemper of affections, it was possible, Second thoughts might present somewhat to their considerations,</Q> which escaped them before.</P>
<P><Q>“”HE remember'd them, that he had passed a Bill, this Parliament, at their entreaty, concerning the captives of <HI>Algiers,</HI> and waved many objections of his own to the contrary, upon information that the busi∣ness had been many Months consider'd by them; whether it proved <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> suitable to their intentions, or whether they had not, by some private Orders, suspended that Act of Parliament upon view of the mistakes, Themselves best knew; as likewise, what other great Alterations they had made upon other Bills, passed this Session. He told them, he could not pass over the putting Their Names out of that Bill, whom before they had recommended to him in their Ordinance, not thinking fit, it seem'd, to trust those, who would obey no Guide but the Law of the Land (he Imagined they would not wish he should in his estimation of others follow that their Rule) and the leaving out, by special pro∣vision, the present Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> as a person in their disfa∣vour; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> whereas, he said, he must tell them, his demeanour had been such, that the City, and the whole Kingdom, was beholding to him for his example.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”To conclude, he said, he did not find himself possessed of such an
<PB N="396" REF="4140"/>
Excess of power, that it was fit to transfer, or consent it should be in other Persons, as was directed by that Bill; and therefore, he should rely upon that Royal right and jurisdiction, which God, and the Law had given him, for the suppressing of Rebellion, and resisting Forreign Invasion; which had preserved the Kingdom in the time of all his Ancestors, and which, he doubted not, but he should be able to exe∣cute. And, not more for his own honour and right, than for the li∣berty and safety of his People,</Q> he could not consent to pass that Bill.</P>
<P>THO' no sober man could deny the reasonableness of that Answer, and that there was indeed so great a difference between the Bill sent <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> by his Majesty, and that presented to him from the two Houses, that it could not soberly be imagined he would consent to it; yet, it had been better for his Majesty, that the first Overture from himself had ne∣ver been made; it giving New life, spirit, and hopes to them; and they making the People believe (who understood not the difference, and knew not that the King▪s pleasure, signify'd by both Houses of Parliament, was in effect the pleasure of both Houses without the King) that his Majesty now refused to consent to what himself had offer'd, and pro∣posed; whilst his own Party (for so those begun now to be called, who preserved their Duty, and Allegiance entire) was as much troubled to <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> find so soveraign a power of the Crown offer'd to be parted with to the two Houses, as was tender'd to them by the King's own Bill; and that it was possible for his Majesty to recede from his firmest Resolves, even in a point, that would not naturally admit of the least division, or di∣minution.</P>
<P>THE King, being well pleased that he had gone through one of his resolutions, and not much troubled at the anger it had produced, and finding his Court full of Persons of Quality of the Country, who made all expressions of affection and duty, which they thought would be most acceptable to him, resolved to undertake an other enterprise, which was <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of more importance, and which in truth was the sole motive of his Journey into those parts. The great Magazine of Armes and Ammu∣nition, which was left upon the disbanding the Army, remained still at <HI>Hull,</HI> and was a nobler proportion than remained in the Tower of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> or all other his Majesty's Stores; and there had been formerly a purpose to have secured the same by the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s presence there, which had been disappointed, as hath been before mentioned, and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> sent thither to look to it; who was now there only with One of the Companies of the Traind-bands; and so the King re∣solved that he would Himself make a Journey thither, with his own <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Usual Train; and being there, that he would stay there, till he had se∣cured the place to him. This was his purpose; which he concealed to that degree, that very few about him knew any thing of it.</P>
<P>ASSOON as it was known that his Majesty meant to reside in <HI>York,</HI> it was easily suspected, that he had an eye upon That Magazine; and there∣fore they made an Order in both Houses, <Q>“”that the Magazine should be removed from <HI>Hull</HI> to the Tower;</Q> and Ships were making ready for the Transportation; so that his Majesty could no longer defer the exe∣cution of what he designed. And, being perswaded, by some who be∣lieved themselves, that if he went thither, it would neither be in S<SUP>r</SUP> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s Will, nor his Power, to keep him out of that Town; and that, being possessed of so considerable a Post, and of the Magazine there, he should find a better temper towards a Modest, and Dutiful Treaty;
<PB N="397" REF="4150"/>
his Majesty took the opportunity of a Petition presented to him by the Gentlemen of <HI>York-shire</HI> (who in truth were much troubled at the Or∣der for removing the Magazine from <HI>Hull;</HI> and were ready to appear in any thing for his Service) in which, <Q>“”they desired him to cast his eye, and thoughts upon the safety of his own Person, and his Princely Issue, and that whole County; a great means whereof, they said, did con∣sist in the Armes, and Ammunition at <HI>Hull,</HI> placed there by his Prince∣ly care and charge; and since, upon general apprehensions of dangers from forreign parts, thought fit to be continued: and they did very <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> earnestly beseech him, that he would take such course, that it might still remain there, for the better securing those, and the rest of the Northern parts.</Q> Hereupon, he resolved to go thither himself; and, the night before, he sent his Son the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who was lately ar∣rived from <HI>Richmond,</HI> accompanied with the Prince Elector, thither, with some other persons of Honour; who knew no more, than that it was a Journey given to the pleasure, and curiosity of the Duke. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> received them with that duty, and civility that became him. The next morning early, the King took Horse from <HI>York;</HI> and, attended with two or three hundred of his Servants, and Gentlemen of the Coun∣try, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> rode thither; and, when he came within a Mile of the Town, sent a Gentleman to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> <Q>“”to let him know that the King would that day dine with him;</Q> with which he was strangely surprised, or Seemed to be so.</P>
<P>THE man was of a fearful nature, and perplexed understanding, and could better resolve upon deliberation than on a suddain; and many were of opinion, that if he had been prepared dextrously before hand, and in confidence, he would have conformed to the King's pleasure; for he was master of a Noble fortune in Land, and rich in Money; of a very ancient Family, and well Allied; his Affections to the Government ve∣ry <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> good; and no man less desired to see the Nation involved in a Civil War, than He: and, when he accepted this imployment from the Par∣liament, he never imagined it would engage him in Rebellion; but be∣lieved, that the King would find it necessary to comply with the Advice of his two Houses; and that the preserving that Magazine from being possessed by him, would likewise prevent any possible rupture into Armes. He was now in great confusion; and calling some of the chief Magistrates, and other Officers together to consult, they perswaded him, not to suf∣fer the King to enter into the Town. And his Majesty coming within an hour after his Messenger found the Gates shut, and the Bridges drawn, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and the Walls mann'd; all things being in a readiness for the reception of an Enemy. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> himself from the Walls, with several professions of Duty, and many expressions of Fear, telling his Majesty "that he durst not open the Gates, being trusted by the Parliament; the King told him, <Q>“”that he believed he had no Order from the Parliament to shut the Gates against him,</Q> or to keep him out of the Town. He replied, <Q>“”that his train was so great, that if it were admitted, he should not be able to give a good account of the Town.</Q> Whereupon the King offer'd <Q>“”to enter with twenty Horse only, and that the rest should stay without. The which the Other refusing, the King desired him "to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> come to him, that he might confer with him, upon his Princely word of safety,</Q> and liberty to return. And when he excused himself like∣wise from That, his Majesty told him, <Q>“”that as this Act of his was un∣parallel'd, so it would produce some notable Effect; that it was not
<PB N="398" REF="4160"/>
possible for him to sit down by such an Indignity, but that he would immediately Proclaim him Traitor, and proceed against him as such; that this disobedience of his would probably bring many miseries upon the Kingdom, and much loss of Blood; all which might be prevented, if he performed the duty of a Subject; and therefore advised him to think sadly of it, and to prevent the necessary growth of so many Ca∣lamities,</Q> which must lie all upon His Conscience. The Gentleman, with much distraction in his looks, talked confusedly of the <Q>“”Trust he had from the Parliament; then fell on his knees, and wished, "that God would bring Confusion upon Him, and His, if he were not a Loyal <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and Faithful Subject to his Majesty; but, in conclusion, plainly denied to suffer his Majesty to come into the Town.</Q> Whereupon, the King caused him immediately to be proclaim'd a Traitor; which the Other received with some expressions of Undutifulness and Contempt. And so the King, after the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and the Prince Elector, with their Retinue, were come out of the Town, where they were kept some hours, was forced to retire that night to <HI>Beverly,</HI> four miles from that place; and the next day returned to <HI>York,</HI> full of Trouble, and Indignation for the Affront he had received; which He foresaw would produce a very great deal of Mischief. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King▪s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the two Houses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</HI></NOTE> THE King sent an Express to the two Houses with a Message, de∣claring what had passed; and <Q>“”that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> had justify'd his Treason and Disloyalty, by pretence of an Order and Trust from Them; which as He could not Produce, so, his Majesty was confident, They would not Own; but would be highly sensible of the Scandal he had laid upon Them, as well as of his Disloyalty to his Majesty. And therefore,</Q> he demanded Justice of them against him, according to Law. The Houses had heard before of the King's going out of <HI>York</HI> thither, and were in terrible apprehension that he had possessed himself of the Town; and that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> (for they were not confident of him, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> as of a man of their own faith) by Promises or Menaces, had given up the Place to him; and, with this apprehension, they were exceedingly Dejected; but when they heard the truth, and found that <HI>Hull</HI> was still in their hands, they were equally Exalted, magnifying their trusty Go∣vernor's faith, and fidelity Against the King. In the mean time, the Gentlemen of the North expressed a marvellous sense and passion on his Majesty▪s behalf; and offer'd to raise the Force of the County to take the Town by force. But the King chose, for many Reasons, to send again to the Houses another Message, in which he told them,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty▪s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mes∣sage to the two Houses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l.</HI></NOTE> <Q>“”THAT He was so much concerned in the undutiful Affront (an In∣dignity <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> all his good Subjects must disdain in his behalf) he had received from S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> at <HI>Hull,</HI> that he was impatient till he received Justice from them; and was compelled to call again for an Answer, be∣ing confident, however they had been so careful, tho' without his con∣sent, to put a Garison into that his Town, to secure it, and his Maga∣zine against any Attempt of the Papists, that they never intended to dispose, and maintain it against Him, their Soveraign. Therefore, he required them forthwith (for the business would admit no delay) to take some Speedy course, that his said Town and Magazine might be immediately delivered up unto him; and that such severe exemplary <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> proceedings should be against those Persons, who had offer'd that in∣supportable Affront and Injury to him, as by the Law was provided: and, till that should be done, he would intend no business whatsoever,
<PB N="399" REF="4170"/>
other than the business of <HI>Ireland.</HI> For, he said, if he were brought into a condition so much worse than any of his Subjects, that, whilst They all enjoyed their Priviledges, and might not have their Posses∣sions disturbed, or their Titles questioned, He only might be spoiled, thrown out of his Towns, and his Goods taken from him, it was time to examin how he had lost those Priviledges; and to try all possible ways, by the help of God, the Law of the Land, and the Affection of his good Subjects to recover them, and to vindicate himself from those Injuries; and, if he should miscarry therein, he should be the first <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Prince of this Kingdom, which had done so, having no other end but to defend the true Protestant Religion, the Law of the Land, and the liberty of the Subject; and he desired God so to deal with him, as he continued in those Resolutions.</Q></P>
<P>INSTEAD of any Answer to his Majesty upon these two Messages, or sadly considering how this breach might be made up, they immediately publish (together with a declaration of their former jealousies of the Papists; of the Malignant Party; of the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>▪s Letter inter∣cepted; of the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s being sent thither, upon which they had first sent down a Governour, and put a Garrison into <HI>Hull)</HI> several <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Votes and Resolutions, by which they Declared,</P>
<P><Q>“”THAT Sr <HI>John Hotham</HI> had done nothing but in obedience to the Command of both Houses of Parliament, and that the Declaring of him a Traitor, being a Member of the House of Commons, was a high breach of the Priviledge of Parliament, and being without due process of Law, was against the Liberty of the Subject, and against the Law of the Land.</Q></P>
<P>AND hearing at the same time, that a Letter coming from <HI>Hull</HI> to them the night after the King's being there, had been intercepted by some of his Majesty's Servants, they declared <Q>“”that all such intercepting <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of any Letters sent to Them, was a high breach of the Priviledge of Parliament, which by the Laws of the Kingdom, and the Protestation, they were bound to defend with their Lives, and their Fortunes, and to bring the Violator thereof to condign Punishment.</Q> Then they or∣der▪d, that the Sheriffs, and Justices of the Peace of the Counties of <HI>York,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and all others his Majesty's Officers, should suppress all Forces, that should be raised or gathered together in those Counties, ei∣ther to force the Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> or stop the passages to, and from the same, or in any other way to disturb the Peace of the Kingdom. All which Votes, Orders, and Declarations being printed, and diligently <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> dispersed throughout the Kingdom before any Address made to his Ma∣jesty in Answer of his Messages, and coming to his View, the King published an Answer to those Votes and Declarations, in which he said:</P>
<P><Q>“”SINCE his gracious Messages to both Houses of Parliament, de∣manding<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Majesty's Answer to the Declaration, and Votes con∣cerning <HI>Hull.</HI></NOTE> Justice for the high and unheard of Affront offer'd unto him, at the Gates of <HI>Hull,</HI> by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> was not thought worthy of an Answer; but that instead thereof, they had thought fit, by their printed Votes, to own and avow that unparallel'd Act to be done in obedience to the Command of both Houses of Parliament (tho' at that time he could produce no such Command) and, with other Resolutions <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> against his proceedings there, to publish a Declaration concerning that business, as an Appeal to the People, and as if their intercourse with his Majesty, and for his satisfaction, were now to no more purpose; tho' he knew that Course of theirs to be very unsuitable to the modesty,
<PB N="400" REF="4180"/>
and duty of Former times, and unwarrantable by any Precedents, but what Themselves had made; yet, he was not unwilling to joyn issue with them in That way, and to let all the world know, how necessary, just, and Lawful all his proceeding's had been in that point, and that the Defence of those proceedings, was the Defence of the Law of the Land, of the Liberty, and Property of the Subject; and that by the same Rule of Justice which was now offer▪d to him, all the Private in∣terest, and Title of all his good Subjects to all their Lands and Goods, was confounded and destroyed. He remember'd them, that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI> had said in his Speech against the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> (which was publish∣ed <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> by Order of the Commons House) the Law is the safeguard, the Custody of all private Interest, your Honours, your Lives, your Li∣berties, and Estates are all in the keeping of the Law; without this every Man hath a like Right to any thing. And he said, he would fain be Answer▪d what Title any Subject of his Kingdom had to his House and Land, that He had not to his town of <HI>Hull?</HI> Or what right any Subject had to his Money, Plate, or Jewels, that his Ma∣jesty had not to his Magazine, and Munition there? If he had ever such a Title, he said he would know, when he Lost it? And if that Magazine and Munition, bought with his own money, were ever His, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> when and how that Property went out of him? He very well knew the great and unlimited power of a Parliament; but he knew as well, that it was only in that sense, as He was a Part of that Parliament; without Him, and against His consent, the Votes of either or both Houses together, must not, could not, should not (if he could help it, for his Subjects sake, as well as his own) forbid any thing that was en∣joyn'd by the Law, or enjoyn any thing that was forbidden by the Law. But in any such alteration, which might be for the Peace, and Happiness of the Kingdom, he had not, should not refuse, to consent. And he doubted not, but that all his good Subjects would easily discern, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> in what a miserable Insecurity and Confusion, they must necessarily and inevitably be, if Descents might be alter'd; Purchases avoided; Assurances and Conveyances cancelled; the Soveraign Legal Autho∣rity despised, and resisted by Votes, or Orders of Either, or both Houses. And this, he said, he was sure, was his Case at <HI>Hull;</HI> and as it was His this day,</Q> by the same Rule, it might be Theirs to Morrow.</P>
<P><Q>“”AGAINST any desperate Design of the Papists, of which they dis∣coursed so much, he had sufficiently expressed his Zeal, and Intentions; and should be as forward to adventure his own Life, and Fortune, to oppose any such designs as the meanest Subject in his Kingdoms.</Q><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Malignant Party, he said, as the Law had not, to his know∣ledge, defined their condition, so Neither House had Presented them to his Majesty, under such a Notion, as he might well understand, Whom they intended; and he should therefore only enquire after, and avoid the Malignant Party, under the Character of persons disaffected to the Peace, and Government of the Kingdom, and such who, neglect∣ing and despising the Law of the Land, had given themselves other Rules to walk by, and so dispenced with their Obedience to Authority; of Those persons, as Destructive to the Common-wealth, he should take all possible caution.</Q><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P><Q>“”WHY any Letters intercepted from the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> wherein He mentioned a retreat to a place of Safety, should hinder him from visiting his own Fort, and how he had opposed any ways of Accommodation
<PB N="401" REF="4190"/>
with his Parliament, and what ways, and Overtures had been offer'd in any way, or like any desire of such Accommodation; or whether his Message of the twentieth of <HI>January</HI> last, so often in vain pressed by him, had not sufficiently expressed his earnest desire of it, he said, all the world should judge; neither was it in the power of any Per∣sons to incline him to take Armes against his Parliament, and his good Subjects, and miserably to embroil the Kingdom in Civil Wars. He had given sufficient Evidence to the world how much his Affections abhorred, and how much his heart did bleed at, the apprehension of <MILESTONE N="01" UNIT="line"/> a Civil War. And, he said, God and the World must judge, if his Care and Industry were not, only to defend and protect the Liberty of the Subject, the Law of the Kingdom, his own just Rights (part of that Law) and his Honour much more precious than his Life: and if, in opposition to these, any Civil War should arise, upon Whose ac∣count the Blood, and Destruction that must follow, must be cast: God and his own Conscience,</Q> told him, that He was clear.</P>
<P><Q>“”FOR Captain <HI>Leg</HI>'s being sent heretofore to <HI>Hull,</HI> or for the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s being sent thither by his Warrant and Authority, he said, he had asked a question long ago, in his Answer to both Houses con∣cerning <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the Magazine at <HI>Hull,</HI> which, he had cause to think, was not easy to be Answer'd; Why the general Rumour of the design of Pa∣pists, in the Northern Parts, should not be thought sufficient ground for his Majesty to put such a Person of Honour, Fortune, and unble∣mished Reputation, as the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> was known to be, into a Town and Fort of his own, where his own Magazine lay; and yet the same Rumour be warrant enough to commit the same Town and Fort, without his consent, to the hands of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> with such a power as was now too well known, and understood? How his Refu∣sal to have that Magazine removed, upon the Petition of both Houses, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> could give any advantage against him, to have it taken from him, and whether it was a Refusal, all men would easily understand, who read his Answer to that Petition; to which, it had not been yet thought fit, to make any Reply.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Condition of those Persons, who presented the Petition to him at <HI>York</HI> (whom that Declaration called, some Few ill affected Per∣sons about the City of <HI>York)</HI> to continue the Magazine at <HI>Hull;</HI> he said, he made no doubt, but that Petition would appear to be attested, both in Number, and Weight, by Persons of Honour and Integrity, and much more conversant with the Affections of the whole Country, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> than most of those Petitions, which had been received with so much Consent, and Approbation. And for the Presumption of interposing Their advice, his Majesty the more wonder'd at that exception, when such encouragement had been given, and thanks declared to Multitudes of mean, unknown People, Apprentices, and Porters, who had accom∣panied Petitions of very strange Natures.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the manner of his going to <HI>Hull,</HI> he said, he had clearly set forth the same, in his Message to both Houses of that business; and for any Intelligence given to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> of an intention to de∣prive him of His life, as he knew there was no such intention in him, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> having given him all possible Assurance of the same, at his being there, so he was confident, no such Intelligence was given, or if it were, it was by some Villain, who had nothing but Malice, or Design to fright him from his due Obedience; and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> had all the reason
<PB N="402" REF="4200"/>
to assure himself, that his Life would be in much more danger by re∣fusing to admit his King into his own Town and Fort, than by yield∣ing him that obedience, which he owed by his Oaths of Alleg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce and Supremacy, and the Protestation, which he knew was due and warrantable, by the Laws of the Land. For the Number of his At∣tendants, tho' that could be no Warrant for such a disobedience in a Subject, he said, it was well known (as his Majesty had expressed in his Message to both Houses, to which credit ought to have been given) that he offer▪d to go into the Town with twenty Horse only, his whole Train being Unarmed; and whosoever thought that too great an At∣tendance <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> for his Majesty, and his two Sons, had sure an intention to bring him to a meaner Retinue,</Q> than they would yet avow.</P>
<P><Q>“”HERE then, he said, was his Case, of which all the world should judge: his Majesty endeavoured to visit a Town, and Fort of his own, wherein his own Magazine lay; a Subject, in defiance of him, shuts the Gates against him; with Armed Men resists, denies, and opposes his en∣trance; tells him, in plain terms, he should not come in. He said, he did not pretend to understand much Law, yet, in the point of Trea∣son, he had had much learning taught him this Parliament; and if the sense of the Statute of the 25<SUP>••</SUP> year of <HI>Edward</HI> the III. <HI>ch.</HI> 2. were not <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> very differing from the Letter, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s Act was no less than plain High-Treason: and he had been contemptibly stupid, if he had after all those circumstances of Grace and Favour then shew'd to him, made any scruple to proclaim him Traitor. And whether he were so, or no, if he would render himself, his Majesty would require no other Trial, than that which the Law had appointed to every Subject, and which he was confident he had not, in the least degree, violated in those proceedings; no more than he had done the Priviledge of Parlia∣ment, by endeavouring, in a just way, to challenge his Own unquestion∣able Priviledges. So that, in such a case, the declaring him Traitor, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> being a Member of the House of Commons, without process of Law, should be a breach of Priviledge of Parliament (of which he was sure none extended to Treason▪ Felony, or breach of Peace) against the Li∣berty of the Subject, or against the Law of the Land, he must have Other reasons than bare Votes. He said, he would know if S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> had, with the Forces by which he kept him out of his Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> pursued him to the Gates of <HI>York,</HI> which he might as legally have done, whether his Majesty must have stayed from declaring him Traitor till Process of Law might have issued against him? Would Fears and Jealousies dispence with necessary, and real Forms? And <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> must his Majesty, when actual War is levied upon him, observe Forms which the Law it self doth not enjoyn? The Case, he said, was truly stated, let all the world judge (unless the mere sitting of a Parliament did suspend all Laws, and his Majesty was the only Person in <HI>England</HI> against whom Treason could not be committed) Where the fault was; and whatsoever course he should be driven to for the vindication of that his Priviledge, and for the recovery and maintenance of his known, undoubted Rights, he doth promise, in the presence of All∣mighty God, and as he hopes for his Blessing in his success, that he would, to the utmost of his power, defend and maintain the true Pro∣testant <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> profession, the Law of the Land, the Liberty of the Subject, and the just Priviledge,</Q> and Freedom of Parliament.</P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Order of Assistance given to the Committees of both Houses,
<PB N="40$" REF="4210"/>
concerning their going to <HI>Hull,</HI> he said, he should say no more, but that those Persons, named in that Order, he presumed, would give No commands, or his good Subjects obey Other, than what were war∣ranted by the Law (how large and unlimited soever the Directions are, or the Instructions might be) for to that Rule he should apply his own Actions, and by it, require an Account from other Men; and that all his good Subjects might the better know their duty in matters of this Nature, he wished them carefully to peruse the Statute of the 11<SUP>th</SUP> year of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. <HI>ch.</HI> I. He said, he would conclude with <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pym</HI>'s own words: If the Prerogative of the King overwhelm the Liberty of the People, it will be turn'd to Tyranny; if Liberty un∣dermine the Prerogative, it would grow into Anarchy, and so into Confusion.</Q></P>
<P>BESIDES their Declaration, Votes, and Orders in the justification of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> for his better Encouragement, and for a ground of his Sons residence at <HI>Hull,</HI> in whom they had in truth a firmer confi∣dence than in the Father, they Order'd, <Q>“”that if, by any Force or Ac∣cident, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> should lose his Life, or Otherwise die in that Service,</Q> that his Son should succeed him in the Government; and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> having thus declared themselves, they thought fit at last to send some particular Answer to the King upon that business; which they were the rather inclined to do, that under that pretence, they might send down a Committee of their own to reside at <HI>York;</HI> whereby they might re∣ceive constant animadversions of what happen'd, and what was design'd, and their Friends, and Dependants in that large, populous, and rich County, be the better confirm'd in their Affections, and Devotions to them; and, to that purpose, they sent down the Lord <HI>Howard</HI> of <HI>Escrigg,</HI> the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hugh Cholmly</HI> (a fast friend to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham)</HI> S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Philip Stapleton,</HI> who had likewise married <HI>Hotham</HI>'s Daughter, and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Harry Cholmly,</HI> who presented their Answer in writing to his Ma∣jesty; the which, being of a Mould unusual, and a Dialect higher and rougher, than even themselves had yet used, I have thought fit to insert in the same words it was delivered; thus.</P>
<P>The most humble Answer of the Lords, and Commons in Parliament to two Messages from your sacred Majesty concerning S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s refusal to give your Majesty entrance into the Town of <HI>Hull.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Answer of the Lords, and Commons to his Ma∣jesty's two Messages con∣cerning <HI>Hull.</HI></NOTE> <Q>“”YOUR Majesty may be pleased to understand, that We, your Great Council, finding manifold evidences of the wicked Counsels, and Pra∣ctices <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of some in near Trust, and Authority about you, to put the King∣dom into a Combustion, by drawing your Majesty into places of strength, remote from your Parliament, and by exciting your People to Commotions, under pretence of serving your Majesty against your Parliament, lest this Malignant Party, by the advantage of the Town, and Magazine at <HI>Hull,</HI> should be enabled to go through with their mischievous Intentions, did, in discharge of the great Trust that lies upon us, and by that Power which in Cases of this nature resides in us, command the Town of <HI>Hull</HI> to be secured by a Garrison of the ad∣joyning Train'd-bands, under the Government of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham;</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> requiring him to keep the same for the Service of your Majesty and the Kingdom: wherein We have done nothing contrary to your Royal Soveraignty in that Town,</Q> or Legal Propriety in the Magazine.</P>
<P><Q>“”UPON consideration of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s proceeding at your Ma∣jesty's
<PB N="404" REF="4220"/>
being there, We have, upon very good ground, adjudged, that he could not discharge the Trust, upon which, nor make good the end, for which he was placed in the Guard of that Town and Maga∣zine, if he had let in your Majesty with such Counsellors, and Com∣pany as were then about you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WHEREFORE, upon full Resolution of both Houses, We have de∣clared S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> to be clear from that odious crime of Treason; and have avowed, that he hath therein done nothing but in obedience to the Command of both Houses of Parliament; assuring our selves that, upon mature deliberation, your Majesty will not interpret his <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> obedience to such Authority to be an Affront to your Majesty, or to be of that nature, as to require any Justice to be done upon him, or satisfaction to be made to your Majesty: but that you will see just cause of joyning with your Parliament, in preserving and securing the Peace of the Kingdom; suppressing this wicked and Malignant Party; who, by false colours, and pretensions of maintaining your Majesty's Prerogative against the Parliament (wherein they fully agree with the Rebels in <HI>Ireland)</HI> have been the causes of all our Distempers, and Dangers.</Q></P>
<P>FOR prevention whereof We know no better remedy, <Q>than settling <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> “”the Militia of the Kingdom, according to the Bill, which We have sent your Majesty without any intention of deserting, or declining the validity, or observance of that Ordinance, which past both Houses, upon your Majesty's former refusal: but We still hold, that Ordinance to be effectual by the Laws of this Kingdom. And We shall be ex∣ceeding glad, if your Majesty by approving these our just, dutiful, and necessary proceedings, shall be pleased to entertain such Counsel, as We assure our selves, by God's blessing, will prove very advantagious for the Honour, and Greatness of your Majesty; the Safety, and Peace of your People; amongst which, We know none more likely to pro∣duce <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> such good effects, than a Declaration from your Majesty of your purpose to lay aside all thoughts of going into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to make a speedy return into these parts, to be near your Parliament. Which as it is our most humble desire, and earnest Petition, so shall it be se∣conded with our most dutiful care for the safety of your Royal Per∣son, and constant Prayers, that it may prove honourable, and success∣ful,</Q> in the happiness of your Majesty, and all your Kingdoms.</P>
<P>TO this Answer, with all formality delivered to his Majesty by the Committee, the King returned a quick Reply:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty's Reply.</NOTE> <Q>“”THAT he had been in good hope, that the reason, why they had so <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> long deferr'd their Answer to his Messages concerning <HI>Hull,</HI> had been, that they might the better have given him satisfaction therein, which now added the more to his Astonishment, finding their Answer, after so long advisement, to be of that nature, which could not but rather increase, than diminish the present distractions, if constantly adhered to by the Parliament. He asked them, whether it was not too much, that his Town of <HI>Hull</HI> had a Garrison put into it, to the great charge of the Country, and Inconvenience to the poor Inhabitants, without His consent and approbation, under colour at That time of Forreign Invasion, and Apprehensions of the Popish Party; but that Now the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> reasons thereof should be Enlarged with a Scandal to his Majesty, and his faithful Servants, only to bring in the more specious Pretext for the avowing S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s Insolence,</Q> and Treason?</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="4230"/>
<Q>“”HE said, he had often heard of the great Trust, that, by the Law of God and Man, was committed to the King for the defence, and safety of his People; but as yet he never understood, what Trust or Power was committed to Either, or Both Houses of Parliament, with∣out the King; They being summon'd to Counsel, and Advise the King. But by what Law or Authority, they possess themselves of his Ma∣jesty's Right and Inheritance, he was confident, that as they had not, so they could not shew. He told them, that he had not hitherto given the least interruption to publick Justice; but They, rather than <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> suffer One of their Members, to come so much as to a legal Trial for the highest crime, would make use of an Order of Parliament to coun∣tenance Treason, by declaring him free from that guilt, which all for∣mer Ages never accounted other; and that without so much as en∣quiring the opinion of the Judges; for he was confident, they would have mentioned their opinion, if they had asked it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEREFORE he expected, that upon further, and better considera∣tion of the great, and necessary consequence of the business of <HI>Hull,</HI> and seriously weighing, how much it did concern the Peace, and Quiet of the Kingdom, They would, without further instance from his Ma∣jesty, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> give him full, and speedy Justice against S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham.</HI> And, he said, he would leave all his good People to think, what hope of Justice there was left for Them, when they Refused, or Delayed to give their own Soveraign satisfaction. And, as he had allready said, till that should be done, he would intend no business whatsoever other than that of <HI>Ireland.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND he said, he likewise expected that They would not put the Militia in execution, until they could shew him by what Law they had Authority to do the same, without His consent; or if they did, he was confident, that he should find much more obedience according to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Law, than they would do against Law. And he should esteem all those, who should obey them therein, to be disturbers of the Peace of the Kingdom; and would, in due Season, call them to a Legal ac∣count for the same.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”CONCERNING his return, he told them, he never heard that the slandering of a King's Government, and his faithful Servants, the re∣fusing of him Justice, and in a case of Treason, and the seeking to take away his undoubted and Legal Authority, under the pretence of putting the Kingdom into a posture of Defence, were Arguments to induce a King to come near, or hearken to his Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/>THE King dispatched this Answer the sooner, that the Country might be freed from the Impression, the Presence and Activity of the Com∣mittee made in them; but when he deliver'd it to them, and required them to make all convenient hast with it to the Houses, they told him, <Q>“”they would send it by an Express, but that themselves were required, and appointed still to reside at <HI>York.</HI> The King told them, "that he liked not such Supervisors near him, and wished them to be very care∣ful in their carriage; that the Country was visibly Then very well af∣fected; and if he found any declension, he well knew to Whom to im∣pute it; and should be compelled to proceed in an other manner against <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> them,</Q> than, with reference to their Persons (for they were all then re∣puted Moderate men, and had not been thought disaffected to the Go∣vernment of Church, or State) "he should be willing to do. They An∣swered with a sullen confidence, <Q>“”that they should demean themselves
<PB N="406" REF="4240"/>
according to their Instructions; and would perform the Trust, reposed in them by the two Houses of Parliament.</Q> Yet such was the ticklish∣ness of the King's condition, that, tho' it was most Evident that their coming, and staying there was to pervert, and corrupt the Loyalty, and Affections of those parts, and to infuse into them Inclinations contrary to their Allegiance, it was not thought Counsellable at that time, either to commit them to Prison, or to expel them from that City, or to inhi∣bit them the freedom of his own Court, and Presence; and so they con∣tinued, for the space of above a Mouth, in <HI>York,</HI> even in defiance of the King. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THE Militia was the Argument, which They found made deepest impression in the People, being totally ignorant what it was, or what the consequence of it might be; and so believing whatsoever They told them concerning it. And therefore they resolved to drive that Nail home; and tho', for want of their Imminent Danger, and during the time of the King's Treaty, and Overture of a Bill, they had forborn the execution of their Ordinance; yet the frequent Musters of Volunteers without Order, allmost in all Countries, by the bare Authority of their Votes, gave them sufficient Evidence how open the People were to their Commands; at least how unprepared Authority was to resist, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> oppose them: and therefore, after the King had displaced their two Fa∣vourites, and refused to pass the Bill for the Militia, and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> had refused to let the King come into the Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> and They had Justify'd him for so doing, they prepared a Declaration concerning the whole State of the Militia, as the Resolution of the Lords and Com∣mons upon that matter; in which they said,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Declara∣tion of the two Houses about the Mi∣litia, <HI>May 5. 1642.</HI></NOTE> <Q>“”THAT holding it necessary for the Peace, and Safety of the King∣dom, to settle the Militia thereof, they had, for that purpose, prepared an Ordinance of Parliament, and with all humility had presented the same to his Majesty for his Royal Assent. Who, notwithstanding the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> faithful Advice of his Parliament, and the several Reasons offer'd by them, of the necessity thereof for the securing of his Majesty's Person, and the Peace and Safety of his People, did refuse to give his Consent; and thereupon, they were necessitated, in discharge of the Trust re∣posed in Them, as the Representative Body of the Kingdom, to make an Ordinance, by the Authority of both Houses, to settle the Militia, warranted thereunto by the Fundamental Laws of the Land: that his Majesty, taking notice thereof, did, by several Messages, invite them to settle the same by Act of Parliament; affirming in his Message sent in Answer to the Petition of both Houses, presented to his Majesty at <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> <HI>York, March</HI> 26. that he allways thought it necessary the same should be settled, and that he never denied the Thing, only denied the Way; and for the Matter of it, took exception only to the preface, as a thing not standing with his Honour to consent to; and that Himself was excluded in the Execution, and for a time Unlimited: whereupon the Lords and Commons, being desirous to give his Majesty all satsfaction that might be, even to the least Title of Form and Circumstances, when his Majesty had pleased to offer them a Bill ready drawn, had, for no other cause, than to manifest their hearty Affection to comply with his Majesty's desires, and obtain his consent, entertain'd the same, in <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the mean time no way declining their Ordinance; and to express their earnest Zeal to correspond with his Majesty's desires (in all things that might consist with the Peace, and Safety of the Kingdom, and the Trust
<PB N="407" REF="4250"/>
reposed in them) did pass That Bill, and therein omitted the Preamble inserted before the Ordinance; limited the time to less than two years; and confined the Authority of the Lieutenants to these three particu∣lars, namely Rebellion, Insurrection, and Forreign Invasion; and re∣turned the same to his Majesty for his Royal Assent: but all these ex∣pressions of Affection and Loyalty, all those desires, and earnest endea∣vours to comply with his Majesty, had, to their great grief and sorrow, produced no better Effects than an absolute denial, even of that which his Majesty by his former Messages, as they conceived, had promised: <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Advice of Evil and Wicked Councils receiving still more Credit with him, than that of his Great Council of Parliament in a matter of so high importance, that the safety of his Kingdom, and peace of his People, depended upon it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT now, what must be the exceptions to that Bill? Not any sure that were to the Ordinance; for a care had been taken to give sa∣tisfaction in all those particulars. Then the Exception was, because that the disposing and execution thereof was refe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd to both Houses of Parliament, and his Majesty Excluded; and Now that, by the Bill, the Power and Execution was ascertain'd, and reduced to par∣ticulars, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and the Law of the Realm made the Rule thereof, his Ma∣jesty would not trust the Persons. The power was too Great, too Unlimited, to trust them with. But what was that Power? Was it any other, but, in express terms, to suppress Rebellion, Insurrection, and Forreign Invasion? And who were those Persons? Were not they such as were nominated by the Great Council of the Kingdom, and As∣sented to by his Majesty? And was it too Great a Power, to trust Those Persons with the suppression of Rebellion, Insurrection, and Forreign invasion? Surely, they said, the most wicked of them who advised his Majesty to that Answer, could not suggest, but that it was necessary <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> for the safety of his Majesty's Royal Person, and the Peace of the King∣dom, such a power should be put in Some hands; and there was no pretence for exception to the Persons. They said, his Majesty had, for the spece of above fifteen years together, not thought a power, far exceeding That, to be too Great to intrust particular Persons with, to whose Will the Lives, and Liberties of his People, by Martial Laws, were made Subject; for such was the power given Lord Lieutenants, and Deputy Lieutenants, in every County of this Kingdom, and that without the consent of the People, or Authority of Law. But now in case of Extreme Necessity, upon the advice of both Houses of Parlia∣ment, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> for no longer space than two years, a Lesser power, and that for the safety of King and People, was thought too Great to trust particular Persons with, tho' named by both Houses of Parliament, and approved by his Majesty Himself: and surely, if there were a necessity to settle the Militia (which his Majesty was pleased to confess) the Persons could not be intrusted with Less power than that, to have it at all Effectual. And the Precedents of former Ages, when there happen'd a Necessity to raise such a Power, never streightn'd that Power to a narrower compass; witness the Commissions of Array in several King's Reigns, and often issued out by the Consent, and Authority of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”THE Lords and Commons therefore, intrusted with the safety of the Kingdom, and peace of the People (which, they called God to witness, was their only aime) finding themselves denied those their so necessary and just Demands, and that they could never be discharged
<PB N="408" REF="4260"/>
before God or Man, if they should suffer the safety of the Kingdom, and peace of the People, to be exposed to the malice of the Malignant Party at home, or the Fury of Enemies abroad: and knowing no other way to encounter the imminent, and approaching danger, but by putting the People into a fit posture of defence, did Resolve to put their said Ordinance in present execution; and did require all persons in Authority, by vertue of the said Ordinance, forthwith to put the same in execution, and all others to obey it, according to the Funda∣mental Laws of the Kingdom in such cases, as they tender'd the up∣holding of the True Protestant Religion, the Safety of his Majesty's <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Person, and his Royal Posterity, the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Being of this Common-wealth.</Q> This Declaration (being in Answer to a Message from his Majesty) was Printed, and, with the usual care and dexterity, dispersed throughout the Kingdom, without so much as sending it to the King; and, thereupon, Warrants and Directions issued into all parts, for the exercising the Militia.</P>
<P>THIS being the first Declaration they had in plain terms published against the King, without ever communicating it, or presenting it to him, as they had done all the rest, his Majesty was the more troubled how to take notice of it; but conceiving it necessary to apply some An∣tidote <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to this Poison, the violent operation whereof he had reason to ap∣prehend, he published a Declaration by way of Answer to that Decla∣ration▪ in which he said,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Declaration in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the foregoing Declaration.</NOTE> <Q>“”THAT he very well understood, how much it was below the High and Royal Dignity (wherein God had placed him) to take notice of, much more to trouble himself with Answering those many scandalous, seditious Pamphlets, and Printed Papers, which were scatter'd, with such great licence throughout the Kingdom (notwithstanding his Ma∣jesty's earnest desire, so often in vain pressed, for a Reformation) tho' he found it evident, that the minds of many of his weak Subjects, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> had been, and still were poyson'd by those means; and that so gene∣ral a terrour had possessed the minds and hearts of all men, that whilst the Presses swarm'd with, and every day produced, new Tracts against the established Government of the Church and State, most men wanted the Courage, or the Conscience to write, or the opportunity and En∣couragement to publish such composed, sober Animadversions, as might either preserve the minds of his good Subjects from such in∣fection, or restore and recover them, when they were so infected: but, his Majesty said, he was contented to let himself fall to any Of∣fice, that might undeceive his People, and to take more pains that <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> way by his Own Pen, than ever King had done, when he found any thing that seem'd to carry the Reputation, and Authority of Either, or Both Houses of Parliament, and would not have the same refuted, and disputed by Vulgar and Common Pens, till he should be through∣ly informed whether those Acts had in truth that Countenance and Warrant, they pretend: which regard of his, his Majesty doubted not but, in time, would recover that due Reverence (the absence whereof he had to much reason to complain of) to his Person and his Messages, which in all Ages had been paid, and, no doubt, was due to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, he had therefore taken notice of a Printed Paper, entituled a Declaration of both Houses, in Answer to his last Message concern∣ing the Militia, published by Command; the which he was unwilling
<PB N="409" REF="4270"/>
to believe (both for the matter of it, the expressions in it, and the manner of publishing it) could result from the consent of both Houses; neither did his Majesty know by what Lawful command, such Un∣comely, Irreverent mention of Him could be publish'd to the world: And, tho' Declarations of that kind had of late, with too much bold∣ness, broken in upon his Majesty, and the whole Kingdom, when one, or both Houses had thought fit to communicate their Counsels, and Resolutions to the People; yet, he said, he was unwilling to believe, that such a Declaration as that could be published in answer to his <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Message, without vouchsafing at least to send it to his Majesty as their Answer. Their business, for which they were met by his Writ and Authority, being to Counsel him for the good of his People, not to Write against him to his People; nor had any consent of his Majesty for their long continuing together enabled them to do any thing, but what they were first summon'd by his Writ to do. At least he would believe, tho' misunderstanding and jealousy (the Justice of God, he said, would overtake the Fomenters of that jealousy, and the Pro∣moters and Contrivers of that misunderstanding) might produce, to say no worse, those very Untoward expressions, that if those Houses <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> had contrived that Declaration as an Answer to his Message, they would have vouchsafed some Answer to the Questions proposed in his, which, he professed, did, and must evidently prevail over his under∣standing; and in their Wisdom and Gravity, they would have been sure to have stated the matters of Fact, as (at least to ordinary under∣standings) might be unquestionable; neither of which was done by that Declaration.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty desired to know, why he was by that Act absolutely excluded from any Power, or Authority in the execution of the Mi∣litia; and, he said, he must appeal to all the world, whether such an <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Attempt, were not a greater and juster ground for Fear and Jealousy in Him, than any one that was avowed for those Destructive Fears and Jealousies which were so publickly own'd, allmost, to the ruin of the Kingdom. But his Majesty had been told, that he must not be jealous of his Great Council of both Houses of Parliament: He said, he was not, no more than they were of his Majesty, their King; and hitherto they had not avow'd any Jealousy of, or Disaffection to his Person; but imputed all to his evil Counsellors, to a Malignant Party, that was not of Their minds; so his Majesty did (and, he said, he did it from his Soul) profess no Jealousy of his Parliament, but of some Turbu∣lent, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Seditious, and Ambitious Natures; which, being not so clearly discern'd, might have an influence even upon the Actions of both Houses: and if that Declaration had passed by that consent (which he was not willing to believe) he said, it was not impossible, but that the apprehension of such Tumults, which had driven his Majesty from his City of <HI>London,</HI> for the safety of his Person, might make such an im∣pression upon other men, not able to remove from the danger, to make them Consent, or not to own a Dissent, in matters not agreable to their Conscience, or Understanding.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, he had mention'd, in that his Answer, his dislike of putting <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Their Names out of the Bill, whom before they recommended to his Majesty, in their pretended Ordinance, and the leaving out, by special Provision, the present Lord Mayor of <HI>London;</HI> to all which the De∣claration afforded no Answer; and therefore he could not suppose it
<PB N="410" REF="4280"/>
was intended for an Answer to that his Message, which whosoever looked upon, would find to be in no degree Answer'd by that Decla∣ration; but it informed all his Majesty's Subjects, after the mention with what humility the Ordinance was prepared, and presented to his Majesty (a matter very evident in the Petitions, and Messages con∣cerning it and his refusal to give his consent, notwithstanding the se∣veral reasons offer'd, of the necessity thereof for the securing of his Person, and the Peace and Safety of his People (whether any such reasons were given, the weight of them, and whether they were not clearly and candidly Answered by his Majesty, the World would easily <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> judge) that they were at last necessitated to make an Ordinance by Authority of both Houses, to settle the Militia, warranted thereunto by the Fundamental Laws of the Land. But, his Majesty said, if that Declaration had indeed intended to have Answer'd him, it would have told his good Subjects what those Fundamental Laws of the Land were, and where to be found: and would, at least, have mention'd one Or∣dinance, srom the first beginning of Parliaments to to this present Par∣liament, which endeavour'd to impose any thing upon the Subject without the King's Consent; for of such, he said, all the enquiry he could make could never produce him one Instance. And if there were <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> such a Secret of the Law, which had lain hid from the beginning of the world to that time, and Now was discover'd to take away the Just, Legal Power of the King, he wished there were not some Other Secret (to be discover'd when they pleased) for the ruin, and destruction of the Liberty of the Subject. For, he said, there was no doubt if the Votes of both Houses had any such Authority to make a New Law, it had the same Authority to repeal the Old; and then, what would be∣come of the long established Rights and Liberties of the King and Subject, and particularly of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> would be easily discern'd by the most ordinary Understanding. <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, it was true, that he had (out of tenderness of the Consti∣tution of the Kingdom, and care of the Law, which he was bound to defend, and being most assured of the unjustifiableness of the pretended Ordinance) invited, and desired both Houses of Parliament to settle whatsoever should be fit of that nature by Act of Parliament. But was he therefore obliged to pass whatsoever should be brought to him of that kind? He did say in his Answer to the Petition of both Houses presented to him at <HI>York</HI> the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI> last (and he had said the same in other Messages before) that he allways thought it necessary that the business of the Militia should be setled, and that he never de∣nied <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the Thing, only denied the Way; and he said the same still; and that since the many Disputes and Votes, upon Lords Lieutenants and their Commissions (which had not been begun by his Majesty, nor his Father) had so discountenanced that Authority, which for many years together was happily looked upon with reverence, and obedience by the People, his Majesty did think it very necessary, that some whole∣som Law should be provided for that Business; but he had declared in his Answer to the pretended Ordinance, that he expected, that that necessary Power should be first invested in his Majesty, before he con∣sented to transfer it to other men; neither could it ever be imagined <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that he would consent that a greater Power should be in the hands of a Subject, than he was thought worthy to be trusted with Himself. And if it should not be thought fit to make a new Act or Declaration
<PB N="411" REF="4290"/>
in the point of the Militia, he doubted not, but he should be able to grant such Commissions as should very legally enable those he trusted, to do all Offices for the peace and quiet of the Kingdom, if any distur∣bance should happen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BuT it was said, he had been pleased to offer them a Bill ready drawn, and that They, to express their earnest Zeal to correspond with his desire, did pass that Bill; and yet all that expression of Affection and Loyalty, all that earnest desire of theirs to comply with his Ma∣jesty, produced no better effect than an absolute denial, even of what <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> by his former Messages his Majesty had promised; and so that Decla∣ration, he said, proceeded, under the pretence of mentioning evil and wicked Counsels, to censure and reproach his Majesty in a Dialect▪ that, he was confident, his good Subjects would read, on his behalf, with much Indignation. But, his Majesty said, sure if that Declara∣tion had passed the examination of both Houses of Parliament, they would never have affirmed, that the Bill he had refused to pass, was the same he had sent to them, or have thought that his Message, where∣in the difference, and contrariety between the two Bills, was so par∣ticularly set down, would be Answer'd with the bare Averring them <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to be one, and the same Bill: nor would they have declar'd, when his exceptions to the Ordinance, and the Bill, were so notoriously known to all, that care being taken to give satisfaction in all the particulars he had excepted against in the Ordinance, he had found New exceptions to the Bill; and yet that very Declaration confessed, that his exception to the Ordinance was, that, in the disposing and execution thereof, his Majesty was Excluded: and was not that an epress reason, in his Answer, for his refusal of the Bill; which that Declaration would needs confute?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BuT the Power was no other than to suppress Rebellion, Insur∣rection, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and Forreign Invasion; and the Persons trusted, no other tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such as were nominated by the Great Council of the Kingdom, and assented to by his Majesty: and they asked, if that were too Great a power to trust those Persons with? Indeed, his Majesty said, whilst so great Liberty was used in Voting, and Declaring men to be Enemies to the Common-wealth (a phrase his Majesty scarce understood) and in censuring men for their Service, and Attendance upon his Majesty's Person, and in his lawful Commands, great heed must be taken into what hands he committed such a power to suppress Insurrection, and Rebellion; and if Insurrection and Rebellion had found other Defini∣tions <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> than what the Law had given, his Majesty must be sure that no Lawful power should justify those Definitions: and if there were Learn∣ing found out to make S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s taking Armes against him, and keeping his Majesty's Town and Fort from him, to be no Treason or Rebellion, he knew not whether a new Discovery might not find it Rebellion in his Majesty to Defend Himself from such Armes, and to endeavour to recover what was so taken from him; and therefore, he said, it concern'd him, till the known Laws of the Land were allow'd to be Judge between them, to take heed into what hands he committed such power.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”BESIDES, he asked, whether it could be thought, that because he was willing to trust certain Persons, that he was obliged to trust them in Whatsoever they were willing to be trusted? He said, no Private hands were fit for such a Trust; neither had he departed from any thing,
<PB N="412" REF="4300"/>
in the least degree, he had offer'd or promised before; tho' He might with as much reason have withdrawn his Trust from some Persons, whom before he had accepted, as They had done from others, whom they had recommended. For the power which he was charged to have committed to particular persons, for the space of fifteen years, by his Commissions of Lieutenancy, it was notoriously known that it was not a power created by his Majesty, but continued very many years, and in the most happy times this Kingdom had enjoyed, even those of his renown'd Predecessors, Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and his Father of happy memory: and whatever Authority had been granted by those Com∣missions, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> which had been kept in the old forms, the same was deter∣minable at his Majesty's pleasure; and he knew not, that they pro∣duced any of those Calamities, which might give his good Subjects cause to be so weary of them, as to run the hazard of so much Mis∣chief, as that Bill, which he had refused, might possibly have pro∣duced.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Precedents of former Ages in the Commissions of Array, his Majesty doubted not, but when any such had issued out, that the King's consent was allways obtain'd, and the Commissions determina∣ble at His pleasure; and then what the extent of Power was, would <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> be nothing applicable to that Case of the Ordinance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BuT whether that Declaration had refuted his Majesty's reasons for his refusal to pass the Bill, or no, it resolved, and required all per∣sons in Authority thereby to put the Ordinance in present execution▪ and all Others to obey it according to the Fundamental Laws of the Land. But, his Majesty said, He, whom God had trusted to maintain and defend those Fundamental Laws, which, he hoped, God would bless to secure him, did declare, that there was no Legal Power in Ei∣ther, or Both Houses, upon any pretence whatsoever, without his Ma∣jesty's consent, to Command any part of the Militia of the Kingdom; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> nor had the like ever been commanded by Either, or Both Houses, since the first foundation of the Laws of the Land; and that the Exe∣cution of, or the Obedience to that pretended Ordinance, was against the Fundamental Laws of the Land, against the Liberty of the Sub∣ject, and the Right of Parliaments, and a High Crime in any that should execute the same: and his Majesty did therefore charge, and command all his loving Subjects of what degree, or quality soever, upon their Allegiance, and as they tender'd the peace of the Kingdom, from thenceforth not to Muster, Levy, or Array, or Summon, or Warn any of the Train'd-bands to rise, Muster or March, by Virtue, or un∣der <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Colour, of that pretended Ordinance: and to that Declaration, and Command of his Majesty's, he said, he expected and required a full Submission, and Obedience from all his loving Subjects, upon their Al∣legiance, as they would Answer the Contrary at their Perils, and as they tender'd the upholding of the True Protestant Religion, the Safety of his Person, and his Royal Posterity, the Peace, and Being of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING these sharp Declarations (infallible Symptoms of sharper Actions) which were with equal diligence dispersed by either side among the People, save that the Agents for the Parliament took as <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> much care to Suppress the King's, as to Publish their own, whereas the King's desire was that they might be both impartially read and examin'd, and to that purpose allways caused those from the Parliament to be

printed with his own, They had the power and skill to perswade men, who, but by that perswasion, could not have been seduced, and without seducing of whom they could have made but a very sorry progress in mischief, <Q>“”that all would be well; that they were well assured that the King would, in the end, yield to what they desir'd; at least, that they should prevail for a good Part, if not for All; and that there should be no War;</Q> tho' themselves well knew, that the fire was too much kindled, to be extinguished without a flame, and made preparations ac∣cordingly. For the raising and procuring of Money (besides the vast <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Sums collected and contributed for <HI>Ireland,</HI> which they disbursed very leisurely, the supplies for that Kingdom, notwithstanding the impor∣tunity and complaint from thence, being not dispatch'd thither, both in quantity and quality, with that expedition as was pretended) they sent out very strict Warrants for the gathering all those Sums of Money, which had been granted by any Bills of Subsidy, or Poll-Bill; in the col∣lection of all which there had been great negligence, probably that They might have it the more at their own disposal in their Need; by which they now recover'd great Sums into their hands. For the raising of Men (tho' it was not Yet time for them to avow the raising an Army) <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> besides the disposing the whole Kingdom to Subject themselves to their Ordinance of the Militia, and, by That, listing in all places companies of Volunteers, who would be ready when they were called, they made more hast than they had done in the Levies of Men, both Horse and Foot, for the relief of <HI>Ireland,</HI> under Officers chosen, or approved by Them∣selves; and proposed the raising of an Army apart, of six or eight thousand, under the Command of the Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> (a man very fast to them) for <HI>Munster,</HI> under the style of the Adventurers Army, and to have no dependance upon, nor be subject to, the Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> but only to receive Orders from the two Houses, and from <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> a Committee to be appointed by them, which should be allways with that Army: but the King, easily discerning the consequence of that de∣sign, refused to grant such a Commission as they desir'd; so that they were forced to be content, only with the advantage of New Exclama∣tions against the King, "for hindering the supplies for <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon the occasion of his denyal of that unreasonable Commission, and to pro∣ceed in their levies the Ordinary way; which they did, with great ex∣pedition. To confirm and encourage the Factious and Schismatical Party of the Kingdom, which thought the pace towards the reformation was not brisk, and furious enough, and was with great difficulty con∣tained <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> in so slow a March, They had, a little before, published a De∣claration,</P>

<P>THIS Declaration, printed, and appointed to be published by the
<PB N="414" REF="4320"/>
Sheriffs in their several Counties, in all the Market Towns within the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> was not more intended to the heartning of those, who were impatient for a Reformation (who in truth had so implicite a Faith in their Leaders, that they expected another manner of Reformation than was publickly promised) than to the lulling those asleep, who begun to be awake with the apprehension of that confusion, they apprehended from the practice and licence, they saw practiced against the received Government, and Doctrine of the Church; and to be perswaded, that it was time to oppose that Current. And, in this project, they were not disappointed: for tho' this warily <MILESTONE N="1$" UNIT="line"/> worded Declaration was evidence enough to Wise men, what They in∣tended; and Logically comprehended an Alteration as great, as has been since attempted, and made; yet to Lazy and Quiet men, who could not discern consequences, and were not willing to Antedate their miseries, by suspecting worse was to come than they felt, or saw in their View, their fears were much abated, and the intentions of the Parliament seem'd not so bad, as they had been told by some that they were: and as this very Declaration of a due Reformation to be made of the Govern∣ment of the Church, and the Liturgy, would, a year before, have given great Umbrage and Scandal to the People▪ when, generally, there was <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="line"/> a due submission to the Government, and a singular reverence of the Li∣turgy of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> so Now, when there was a General fear and apprehension inculcated into them, of a purpose utterly to sub∣vert the Government, and utterly to abolish the Liturgy, they thought the taking away nothing in the One or the Other, but what should be Evil, and Justly offensive, or, at least, Unnecessary and Burthensom, was an easy Composition; and so, by degrees, they suffer'd themselves to be still prevailed on towards ends, they extremely abhorred; and what at first seem▪d Prophane and Impious to them, in a little time ap∣pear▪d only Inconvenient; and what, in the beginning, they thought <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> matter of Conscience and Religion, shortly after they looked upon, as somewhat rather to be Wished than positively Insisted on; and conse∣quently not to be laid in the balance with the Publick Peace, which they would imagin to be endanger▪d by opposing the sense that then pre∣vailed: and so, by Undervaluing many particulars (which they Truly esteem'd) as rather to be consented to, than that the general should suf∣fer, they Brought, or Suffer▪d the Publick to be brought to all the suffer∣ings it since underwent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> AND now they shew'd what Consultation they meant to have with Godly and Learned Divines, and what Reformation they intended, by <MILESTONE N="4$" UNIT="line"/> appointing the Knights and Burgesses to bring in the Names of such Di∣vines for the several Counties, as they thought fit to constitute an As∣sembly for the framing a new Model for the Government of the Church, which was done accordingl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ those who were true Sons of the Church, not so much as endeavouring the Nomination of Sober, and Learned Men, abhorring such a Reformation, as begun with the Invasion, and Suppression of the Churchs Rights in a Synod, as well known as <HI>Magua Charta:</HI> and if any well affected Member, not enough considering the scandal, and the consequence of that Violation, did Name an Orthodox, and well reputed Divine, to assist in that Assembly, it was Argument <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> enough against him, that he was Nominated by a Person in whom they had no Confidence; and They only had reputation enough to Commend to this Consultation, who were known to desire the utter demolishing
<PB N="415" REF="4330"/>
of the whole Fabrick of the Church: so that of about one hundred and twenty, of which that Assembly was to consist (tho', by the recommen∣dation of two or three Members of the Commons, whom they were not willing to displease, and by the Authority of the Lords, who added a small Number to those named by the House of Commons, a few very Reverend, and Worthy men were inserted; yet of the whole Number) they were not above Twenty, who were not declar'd, and avow'd Ene∣mies to the Doctrine, or Discipline of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> some of them infamous in their lives, and conversations; and most of them of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> very mean parts in Learning, if not of Scandalous Ignorance; and of no other reputation, than of malice to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> so that that Convention hath not Since produced any thing, that might not Then reasonably have been expected from it</P>
<P>BUT that which gave greatest power, and strength to their growing Faction, was the severity they used against all those, of what Quality or Degree soever, who opposed their Counsels, and Proceedings. If any Lord, who had any place of Honour, or Trust from the King, concurred not with them, they made an inquisition into the whole passages of his Life; and if they could find no Fault, or no Folly (for any Levity, or <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Indiscretion served for a Charge) to reproach him with, it was enough "that they could not Confide in him: so they threatned the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> who with extraordinary vivacity crossed their Consultations, <Q>“”that they would remove him from his Charge and Government of the Isle of <HI>Wight</HI> (which at last they did <HI>de facto,</HI></Q> by committing him to Prison without so much as assigning a Cause) and to that purpose, ob∣jected all the Acts of good fellowship; all the wast of Powder, and all the wast of Wine, in the drinking of Healths; and other Acts of Jollity, when ever he had been at his Government, from the first hour of his entering upon it: so that the Least inconvenience a man in their Dis∣favour <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> was to expect, was to have his Name and Reputation used, for two or three hours, in the House of Commons with what Licence and Virulency they pleased. None were persecuted with more rigour, than the Clergy; whereof whosoever publickly, or privately, censured their Actions, or suspected their Intentions, was either committed to prison, or compelled to a chargeable and long Attendance, as inconvenient as Imprisonment. And this measure of proceeding was Equally, if not with More animosity, applied to those, who, in former times, had been looked upon by that Party with most reverence. On the contrary, who∣ever Concurred, Voted, and Sided with them, in their extravagant con∣clusions, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> let the infamy of his Former life, or Present practice be what it would; his injustice and oppression never so scandalous, and notorious; He was received, countenanc'd, and protected with marvellous demon∣strations of Affection: so that, between those that Loved them, and those that Fear'd them; those that did not love the Church, and those that did not love some Church-men; those whom the Court had op∣pressed, and those who had helped the Court to oppress Others; those who fear'd their Power, and those who fear'd their Justice; their Par∣ty was grown over the Kingdom, but especially in the City, justly For∣midable.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> IN the mean time, the King omitted no opportunity to provide against the Storm he saw was coming; and, tho' he might not Yet own the apprehension of that danger he really found himself in, he neglected not the provision of what he thought most necessary for his defence; he caused
<PB N="416" REF="4340"/>
all his Declarations, Messages, and Answers, to be industriously com∣municated throughout his Dominions; of which he found good effects; and, by their reception, discover'd that the People universally were not so irrecoverably poison'd, as he before had cause to fear: He caused pri∣vate intimations to be given, and insinuations to be made to the Gentry "that Their presence would be acceptable to him; and to those, who came to him, he used much gracious freedom, and expressed all possi∣ble demonstrations, that he was glad of their Attendance: so that, in a short time, the resort to <HI>York</HI> was very great; and, at least, a good face of a Court there <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>BEYOND the Seas, the Queen was as intent to do Her part; and to provide that so good Company, as she heard was daily gather'd together about the King, should not be dissolved for want of Weapons to defend one another: and therefore, with as much secrecy, as could be used in those Cases, and in those places where she had so many Spies upon her, she caused, by the Sale or Pawning of her own, and some of the Crown Jewels, a good quantity of Powder and Armes to be in a readiness in <HI>Holland,</HI> against the time that it should be found necessary to transport it to his Majesty: so that both Sides, whilst they entertain'd each other with discourses of Peace (which allways carried a sharpness with them, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that whetted their appetite to War) provided for that War, which they saw would not be prevented.</P>
<P>HITHERTO the greatest Acts of Hostility, saving that at <HI>Hull,</HI> were perform'd by Votes, and Orders; for there was Yet no visible, formal execution of the Ordinance for the Militia, in any one County of <HI>England:</HI> for the appearance of Volunteers in some factious Corporations was rather Countenanced, than positively Directed and Enjoyn'd by the Houses: and most places pretended an Authority, granted by the King in the Charters, by which those Corporations were erected, or consti∣tuted; but Now they thought it time to satisfy the King, and the Peo∣ple, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that they were in Earnest ▪who were hardly perswaded, that they had in truth the courage to execute their own Ordinance) and Resolved, <Q>“”that, on the tenth of <HI>May,</HI> they would have all the Train'd▪bands of <HI>London,</HI> Muster'd in the Fields, where that exercise usually was per∣form'd,</Q> and accordingly, on that day, their own new Officer, Serjeant-Major-General <HI>Skippon,</HI> appear'd in <HI>Finsbury</HI> Fields, with all the Train'd-bands of <HI>London</HI> consisting of above eight thousand Soldiers, disposed into six Regiments, and under such Captains and Colonels, as they had cause to Confide in. At this first triumphant Muster, the Members of both Houses appear'd in gross; there being a Tent purposely set up for <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> them, and an entertainment at the Charge of the City to the value of near a thousand pounds; all men presuming, that this example of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> with such ceremony and solemnity, would be easily follow'd through∣out the Kingdom; and many believing, they had made no small pro∣gress towards the end they aimed at, by having engaged the very body of the City in a guilt equal to their own: for' tho' they had before suffi∣cient evidence of the Inclinations of the Mean, and Common people to them, and reasonable assurance, that those in Authority would hardly be able to contain them; yet, till this day, they had no instance of the Concurrence of the City in an Act expressly Unlawful. But now they <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> presumed all difficulties were over; and so sent their Directions to the Counties adjacent, speedily to execute the same Ordinance; and ap∣pointed all the Magazines of the several Counties of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI>
<PB N="417" REF="4350"/>
to such Custody, as their Lord Lieutenants, or their Deputy Lieutenants should appoint; and that not only the Counties should increase those Magazines to what proportion soever they thought convenient, but that any private Persons, that were well affected, should supply them∣selves with what Armes and Ammunition they pleased. By which means, besides the King's Magazines, all which were in their possession, they caused great quantitities of all sorts of Armes to be provided, and disposed to such places, and Persons, as they thought fittest to be trusted; especially in those factious Corporations, which had listed most Volun∣teers <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> for their Service.</P>
<P>THE King now saw the Storm coming apace upon him; that (not withstanding his Proclamation published against the Ordinance of the Militia, in which he set down the Laws and Statutes, which were in∣fringed thereby, and by which the execution of that Ordinance would be no less than High-Treason▪ the Votes, and Declaration of both Houses <Q>“”that those Proclamations were illegal, and that those Acts of Parliaments could not control the Acts, and Orders of both Houses (which the Subjects were, by the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, to obey) prevail'd so far,</Q> that obedience was given to them; that he was so far from being like to have <HI>Hull</HI> restored to him, that the Garrison <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> there daily increased, and forced the Country to submit to such Com∣mands, as they pleased to lay on them; and that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> was more likely to be able to Take <HI>York,</HI> than his Majesty to Recover <HI>Hull;</HI> he thought it, therefore, high time, by Their example, to put him∣self into a posture of Defence; the danger being much more Imminent to his Majesty, than to those, who had begot that Ordinance. Here∣upon, at a publick meeting of the Country, his Majesty declared <Q>“”that he was resolved, in regard of the Publick distempers, and the neigh∣bourhood of <HI>Hull,</HI> to have a Guard for his Person; but of such Per∣sons, and with such Circumstances, as should administer no occasion <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of Jealousy to the most Suspicious; and wished the Gentlemen of Quality,</Q> who attended, to consider, and advise of the way: Who short∣ly after notwithstanding the opposition given by the Committee, which still resided there; and the factious Party of the County, which was inflamed, and govern'd by them) expressed a great alacrity to comply with his Majesty's desire, in whatsoever should be proposed to them; and a sense, <Q>“”that they thought a sufficient Guard was very necessary for the security of his Majesty's Person.</Q> Hereupon, the King ap∣pointed such Gentlemen as were willing, to list themselves into a Troop of Horse, and made the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> their Captain; and made choice <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of One Regiment of the Train'd-bands, consisting of about six hundred, whom he caused, every <HI>Saturday,</HI> to be paid at his own charge; when he had little more in his Coffers, than would defray the weekly expence of his Table: and this Troop, with this Regiment, was the Guard of his Person; it being first declared by his Majesty, <Q>“”that no Person should be suffer'd, either in the Troop, or the Regiment, who did not, before his Admission into the Service, take the Oaths of Allegiance, and Su∣premacy;</Q> that so he might be free from the scandal of entertaining Papists for his security.</P>
<P>BUT this caution would not serve; the Fears and Jealousies were <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> capable of no other Remedies, than such as were prescribed by those Physicians, who were practiced in the Disease.

of his Person, an Action so legal, in a Manner so peaceable, upon Causes so evident and necessary, should not only be looked upon, and Peti∣tion'd against by them, as a cause of Jealousy; but declar'd to be raising of a War against them, contrary to his former professions of his care of Religion, and Law: and he no less wonder'd, that That Action of his should be said to be apprehended by the Inhabitants of that County, as an Affrightment, and Disturbance to his People, having been as well Received there, as it was every where to be Justify'd; and (he spake of the general, not of a few seduced Particulars) assisted, and sped by <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> that County, with that loyal Affection and Alacrity, as was a most ex∣cellent example, set to the rest of the Kingdom, of their care of his safety upon all occasions; and should never be forgotten by Him, nor he hoped, by his Posterity; but should be ever paid to them, in that, which is the proper expression of a Princes gratitude, a perpetual, vi∣gilant care to govern them justly, and to preserve the only Rule, by which they can be so govern'd, the Law of the Land: and, he said, he was confident, that, if they were Themselves Eye-witnesses, they would so see the Contrary, as to give little present Thanks, and, hereafter, little Credit to their Informers; and, if they had no better information, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and intelligence of the Inclinations, and Affections of the rest of the Kingdom, certainly the minds of his People (which to some Ends, and Purposes,</Q> they did represent) were but ill represented unto Them.</P>
<P><Q>“”HE asked them, when they had so many Months together not con∣tented themselves to rely for security, as their Predecessors had done, upon the Affection of the People, but by their own Single Authority had raised to themselves a Guard (and that sometimes of no ordinary Numbers, and in no ordinary Way) and yet all those Pikes and Pro∣testations, that Army, on One side, and that Navy, on the Other, had not perswaded his Majesty to command them to disband their Forces, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and to content themselves with their Ordinary, that was, No guard; or work in him an opinion that they appear'd to levy War against him, or had any further design; how it was possible, that the same Persons should be so apt to suspect, and condemn his Majesty, who had been so unapt, in the Same matter, upon much More ground, to tax or suspect Them? This, he said, was his Case, notwithstanding the Care and Fidelity of his Parliament: his Fort was kept by arm'd men against him; his proper Goods first detained from him, and then, contrary to his command, by strong hand offer'd to be carried away; in which, at once, all his Property, as a Private person; all his Authority, as a King, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> was wrested from him: and yet for him to secure himself in a Legal way, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> might not by the same Forces, or by more, raised by pretence of the same Authority (for he daily raised some, and it was no new thing for him to pretend orders, which he could not shew) continue the War that he had levied against his Majesty; and as well imprison his Person, as detain his Goods; and as well shut him up in <HI>York,</HI> as shut him out of <HI>Hull;</HI> was now said to be esteem'd a cause of great Jealousy to the Parliament, a raising a War against them, and of danger to the whole Kingdom: whilst these Injustices, and Indignities offer'd to him were countenanced by Them, who ought <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to be most forward in his Vindication, and their Punishment, in ob∣servation of their Oaths, and Trust reposed in them by the People, and to avoid the Dissolution of the present Government. Upon which Case, he said, the whole world was to judge, whether his Majesty had not
<PB N="420" REF="4380"/>
reason, not wholely to rely upon the Care, and Fidelity of his Parlia∣ment, being so strangely blinded by malignant spirits, as not to per∣ceive his Injuries; but to take some care of his own Person, and, in order to that, to make use of that Authority, which the Laws declar'd to be in his Majesty: and, whether that Petition, with such a threatning Conclusion, accompanied with more threatning Votes, gave him not cause, rather to increase, than to diminish his Guards; especially, since he had seen, before the Petition, a printed Paper dated the seventeenth of <HI>May,</HI> underwritten by the Clerk of the House of Commons, com∣manding in the name of both Lords and Commons, the Sheriffs of all <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Counties to raise the power of all those Counties, to suppress such of his Subjects, as, by any of his Majesty's commands, should be drawn to∣gether, and put (as that Paper called it) in a posture of War; charging all his Majesty's Officers, and Subjects to assist them in it, at their Perils. For tho', he said, he could not suspect, that That Paper; or any bare Votes, not grounded upon Law or Reason; or Quotations of repeal'd Statutes, as those were of the 2 <HI>Rich.</HI> II. and I <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. should have any ill influence upon his good People, who knew their duties too well not to know that to take up Armes against those, who, upon a Legal command of his Majesty, came together to a most Legal end (that was, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty's security, and preservation) were to levy War against his Majesty; yet, if that Paper were really the Act of both Houses, he could not but look upon it, as the highest of Scorns and Indignities; First, to issue out Commands of Force against him; and, after those had appear'd useless, to offer, by Petition, to perswade him to that, which that Force should have effected.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, he concluded his Answer to their Petition with his Coun∣sel to them, that they would joyn with him in exacting satisfaction for that unparallel'd, and Yet unpunish'd Action of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham;</HI> and that they would command his Fort, and Goods to be return'd to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> his own hands: that they would lay down all pretences (under pre∣tence of Necessity, or declaring what is Law) to make Laws without his Majesty, and, by consequence, but a Cipher of his Majesty: that they would declare effectually against Tumults, and call in such Pam∣phlets (punishing the Authors, and publishers of them) as seditiously endeavour to disable his Majesty from protecting his People, by weakning, by false Aspersions and new false Doctrines, His Authority with Them, and Their Confidence in Him: the particulars of which Tumults, and Pamphlets, he said, he would long since have taken care, his Learned Council should have been enabled to give in evidence, if, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> upon his former offer, his Majesty had received any return of encou∣ragement from them in it: and, he said, if they did That, they would Then, and hardly till Then, perswade the World, that they had dis∣charged their duty to God, the Trust reposed in them by the People, and the Fundamental Laws, and Constitutions of the Kingdom; and imployed their care, and utmost power, to secure the Parliament (for, he said, He was still a part of the Parliament, and should be, till this well temper'd Monarchy was turn'd to a Democracy) and to preserve the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom; which, together with the De∣fence of the Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and his own <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> just Prerogative (as a part of, and a defence to those Laws) had been the main End, which in his Consultations, and Actions, he had pro∣posed to Himself.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="421" REF="4390"/>
IT will be wonder'd at hereafter, that in a judging and discerning State, where Men had, or seem'd to have, their faculties of reason, and understanding, at the heigth; in a Kingdom Then unapt, and generally uninclined to War (how wantonly soever it hath Since seem'd to throw away it's Peace) those Men, who had the skill and cunning, out of fro∣ward and peevish humours and indispositions to compound Fears and Jealousies, and to animate and inflame those Fears and Jealousies into the most prodigious, and the boldest Rebellion, that any Age, or Country ever brought forth; who very well Saw, and Felt that the King had not <MILESTONE N="$$" UNIT="line"/> only, to a degree, wound himself out of that Labyrinth, in which, four Months before, they had involved him, with their Priviledges, Fears, and Jealousies; but had even so well informed the People, that they be∣gun to question both their Logick and their Law, and to suspect, and censure the improvement, and gradation of their Fears, and the extent, and latitude of their Priviledges; and that they were not only Denied by the King, what they required, but that the King's Reasons of His denial made very many conclude the Unreasonableness of Their de∣mands: I say, it may seem strange, that these Men could entertain the hope, and confidence to obtrude such a Declaration, and Vote, upon the <MILESTONE N="2$" UNIT="line"/> People, "that the King did intend to make War against the Parliament; when they were so far from apprehending, that he would be able to get an Army to disturb them, that they were most assured, he would not be able to get Bread to sustain Himself three Months, without submitting all his Counsels to Their conduct, and controll; and that the offering to impose it, did not awaken the People to an indignation, which might have confounded them: for, besides their Presumption in endeavouring to Search, what the Scripture it self told them was Unsearchable, the Heart of the King; the very Law of the Land, whose defence they pre∣tended, makes no conclusion of the Intention of the meanest Subject, in <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> a matter of the highest, and tenderest consideration, even Treason it self against the life of the King, without some overt, unlawful Act, from whence, and other circumstances, the ill Intention may be Reasonably made appear; and therefore, to declare that the King intended to make War against his Parliament, when he had neither Ship, Harbour, Armes nor Money, and knew not how to get any of them, and when he offer'd to Grant any thing to them, which they could pretend a justifiable rea∣son for Asking, was an undertaking of that Nature, that even the All∣mightiness of a Parliament might have despair'd to succeed in.</P>
<P>BUT, notwithstanding all this, they very well knew What they did, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and understood what infinite advantage that Vote would (as it did) bring to them; and, that a Natural way would never bring them to their Un∣natural end. The power and reputation of Parliament, they believed, would Implicitly prevail over many; and amaze and terrify others from disputing, or censuring What they did, and upon what Grounds they did it. The difficulty was, to procure the judgment of Parliament; and to incline those different constitutions, and different affections, to such a Concurrence, as the judgment might not be discredited, by the Num∣ber of the Dissenters; nor wounded, or prejudged by the Reasons, and Arguments given against it: and then, their judgments of the Cure be∣ing <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to be grounded upon the nature, and information of the Disease, it was necessary to confine, and contract their fancies and opinions within some bounds, and limits: the mystery of Rebellion challenging the same encouragement with other Sciences, to grow by; that there may be
<PB N="422" REF="4400"/>
certain Postulata, some Principles and Foundations, upon which the main building may subsist. So, in the case of the Militia, an Imminent danger must be first Supposed, by which the Kingdom is in apparent hazard, and then the King's refusal to apply any remedy against that dan∣ger, before the two Houses would pretend to the power of disposing that Militia: it being too ridiculous to have pretended the natural and ordi∣nary Jurisdiction over it: but, in case of danger, and danger so Imminent, that the Usual recourse would not serve the turn, and for the saving of a Kingdom, which must Otherwise be lost, many Good men thought it was reasonable to apply a very Extraordinary prevention, without ima∣gining <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> such a supposition might possibly engage them in any Action, contrary to their own Inclinations; and, without doubt, very many who frankly Voted that Imminent necessity, were induced to it, as an Argument, that the King should be therefore importuned to consent to the Settlement; which would not have appeared so necessary a Request, if the occasion had not been Important; never suspecting, that it would have been improved into an Argument to them, to adventure the doing it without the King's consent. And it is not here unseasonable (how merry soever it may seem to be) as an instance of the Incogitancy, and Inadvertency of those kind of Votes and Transactions, to remember that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the first Resolution of the Power of the Militia being grounded upon a Supposition of an Imminent necessity, the Ordinance first sent up, from the Commons, to the Lords, for the execution of the Militia, expressed an <HI>eminent</HI> necessity; whereupon, some Lords, who understood the dif∣ference of the words, and that an Eminent necessity might be supplied by the ordinary provision, which, possibly, an <HI>imminent</HI> necessity might not safely attend, desired a Conference with the Commons, for the Amendment; which, I remember, was at last, with great difficulty, consented to: many (who, I presume, are not yet grown up to conceive the difference) supposing it an unnecessary contention for a Word, and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> so yielding to them, for saving of time, rather than dispute a thing which to Them seem'd of no great moment.</P>
<P>THEY, who contrived this Scene, never doubted, but after a Reso∣lution what was to be done upon a Supposed necessity, they should ea∣sily, when they found it Convenient, make that necessity Real. It was no hard matter to make the Fearful, apprehensive of Dangers; and the Jealous, of Designs; and they wanted not Evidence of all kinds; of Let∣ters from abroad, and Discoveries at home, to make those apprehen∣sions formidable enough; and then, tho', Before the Resolution, there was a great latitude in Law and Reason, what was Lawfully to be done, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> they had Now forejudged themselves, and Resolved of the Proper re∣medy, except they would argue against the Evidence; which Usually would have been to discountenance, or undervalue some Person of no∣table reputation, or his Correspondence; and allways, to have opposed That that was of such an Allay, as, in truth, did operate upon the Major part. So, in the Case upon which we now discourse, if they had, in the most advantageous Article of their fury, professed the raising an Ar∣my against the King, there was yet that reverence to Majesty, and that Spirit of Subjection and Allegiance in most Men, that they would have looked upon it with Opposition, and Horrour: but Defensive Armes <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> were more plausible Divinity, and if the King Should commit such an Outrage, as to levy War against his Parliament, to destroy the Religion, Laws, and Liberty of the Kingdom, Good men were perswaded, that
<PB N="423" REF="4410"/>
such a resistance might be made, as might preserve the Whole; and he that would have argued against this Thesis, besides the Impertinency of arguing against a supposition, that was not like to be Real, and in which the Corrupt consideration of Safety seem'd to bribe most Men, could never escape the censure of promoting Tyranny, and lawless Do∣minion. Then to incline Men to concur in the Declaration <Q>“”of the King's Intention to make War against the Parliament,</Q> they were per∣swaded it might have a Good, and Could have no ill effect: the reme∣dies, that were to be applied upon an Actual levying of War, were not <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> justifiable upon the Intention; and the declaring this Intention, and the Dangers it carried with it to the King himself, and to all those who should assist him, would be a probable means of reforming such Inten∣tion, and preventing the Execution: Inconvenience it could produce none (for the disquieting, or displeasing the King was not thought In∣convenient) if there were no progress in the supposed Intention; if there were, it were fit the whole Kingdom should stand upon it's Guard, and not be Surprised to it's confusion.</P>
<P>BY these false, and fallacious Mediums, the clearness of Men'sunder∣standings were dazled; and, upon the matter, all their opinions, and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> judgments for the Future, captivated and praeengaged by their own Votes, and Determinations. For, how easy a matter is it to make it appear to that man, who consented that the King Intended to make War against the Parliament, that when he should Do it, he had broken his Oath, and dissolved his Government; and, that whosoever should assist him were Traitors? I say, how easy was it to perswade That man, that he was obliged to defend the Parliament; to endeavour to uphold That Govern∣ment; and to resist Those Traitors? and, whosoever considers that the nature of men, especially of men in Authority, is inclined rather to Commit two errours, than to Retract one, will not marvel, that from <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> this Root of unadvisedness, so many, and tall Branches of mischief have proceeded. And therefore, it were to be wished, that those who have the honour to be trusted in Publick Consultations, were indued with so much natural Logick, to discern the consequences of every publick Act, and Conclusion; and with so much Conscience and Courage, to watch the First impressions upon their understanding and complyance: and that, neither out of the Impertinency of the thing, which men are all apt to conclude out of impatiency of dispatch; or out of Stratagem to make men Odious (as in this Parliament many forbore to oppose un∣reasonable resolutions, out of an opinion that they would make the con∣trivers <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Odious) or upon any other (tho' seeming never so Politick) con∣siderations, they consent not to any Propositions, by which Truth or Justice are invaded. I am confident, with very good Warrant, that many men have, from their Souls, abhorred every Article of this Rebellion; and heartily deprecated the miseries, and desolation we have suffer'd by it, who have Themselves, with great alacrity and industry, contributed to, if not Contrived, those very Votes and Conclusions, from whence the Evils they abhor, have most naturally and regularly flowed, and been deduced; and which they could not reasonably, upon their own concessions, contradict and oppose.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> BUT to conclude, a man shall not unprofitably spend his contem∣plation, that, upon this occasion, considers the method of God's Justice (a Method terribly remarkable in many Passages, and upon many Per∣sons; which we shall be compelled to remember in this discourse) that
<PB N="424" REF="4420"/>
the Same Principles, and the Same Application of those principles, should be used to the wresting all Soveraign Power from the Crown, which the Crown had a little before made use of for the extending it's Autho∣rity, and Power, beyond, it's bounds, to the prejudice of the Just rights of the Subject. A Supposed necessity was Then thought ground enough to create a Power, and a bare Averment of that necessity to beget a Practice to impose what Tax they thought convenient upon the Subject, by Writs of Ship-money never before known; and a Supposed necessity Now, and a bare Averment of that necessity, is as confidently, and more Fatally, concluded a good ground to exclude the Crown from the use of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> any power, by an Ordinance never before heard of; and the same Maxim of <HI>Salus populi Suprema lex,</HI> which had been used to the infring∣ing the Liberty of the one, made use of for the destroying the Rights of the Other: only that of the Psalmist is yet Inverted; for many of those, who were the Principal makers of the first Pit, are so far from falling into it, that they have been the chiefest Diggers of the second D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch, in which so many have been confounded.</P>
<P>THO' they had yet no real apprehension, that the King would be able, in the least degree, to raise a Force against them, yet they were heartily enraged to find that he lived more like a King, than they wished he <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> should; that there was so great resort to him from all parts; and that whereas little more than two Months before, his own Servants durst hardly avow the waiting on him, Now the chief Gentlemen of all Coun∣ties Travelled to him, to render their Service, which implied a Disap∣probation at least, if not a Contempt of the two Houses carriage towards him. Therefore, to prevent this mischief, they easily found exception to, and information against, some Persons, who had resorted to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ork;</HI> whom they sent the Serjeant of the House of Commons to apprehend, and bring them before the House as Delinquents, to Answer such matters, as should be objected against them. In this Number there was one <HI>Beckwith,</HI> a <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Gentleman of <HI>York-shire,</HI> who, as S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> had sent them word, had endeavour'd to corrupt some Officers of the Garrison to deliver <HI>Hull</HI> up to the King; this they declar'd to be a very heinous crime, and little less than High Treason, and therefore concluded him a Delinquent, and to be sent for to attend them: it was thought strangely ridiculous by Standers by, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> should be justify'd for keeping the Town against the King, and another Gentleman be Voted a Deliquent for designing to recover it to it's Allegiance; and that They, who, but few days before, when the King had sent a Warrant to require Serjeant-Major <HI>Skippon</HI> to attend his Majesty at <HI>York,</HI> Resolved, and published <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> their Resolution in Print (as they did all things, which they conceived might diminish the Reputation of the King, or his Authority) <Q>“”that such command from his Majesty was against the Law of the Land, and the Liberty of the Subject, and likewise (the Person being imployed by Them to attend Their Service) against the Priviledge of Parliament; and therefore, that their Serjeant-Major-General of the Forces of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> (that was his Style) should continue to attend the Service of both Houses according to their former Commands;</Q> should expect that their Warrant should be submitted to by those, who were waiting on the King, whose known legal Authority, served from any thing that might <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> be understood to relate to the Parliament, or it's Priviledges, they had so fla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly contrad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted and contemned, that the same day on which they redeem d their Officer <HI>Skippon</HI> from his Allegiance, and Duty of going

to the King, being informed, that the King had sent a Writ to Adjourn the Term (Midsummer Term) to <HI>York</HI> from <HI>Westminster,</HI> which, with∣out all question, was in his power Legally to do, they declared, <Q>“”that the King's removing of the Term to <HI>York</HI> from <HI>Westminster,</HI> sitting the Parliament,</Q> was Illegal; and Order'd, "that the Lord Keeper should not issue out any Writs, or Seal any Proclamation, to that pur∣pose;" which was by him observ'd accordingly, notwithstanding the King's Command for the Adjournment.</P>
<P>WHEN their Officer came to <HI>York</HI> for the apprehension of the Delin∣quents, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> he found the same neglect There of the Parliament, as was found Above of the King; and was so ill intreated by those, whom he looked upon as his Prisoners, that, if the King's extraordinary provision had not been interposed, the Messenger would scarce have return'd to have reported how uncurrent such Warrants were like to be in <HI>York,</HI> and how perillous such Voyages might prove to the Adventurers: But how amazed, or surprised soever they seem'd to be with this new contra∣diction, it was no more than they looked for; for their Dilemma was, if their Messenger return'd with his prize, all the resort to, and all the glory of <HI>York</HI> was determined; for no Man would repair thither, from <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> whence the bare Voting him a Delinquent would remove him with those other Inconvenient circumstances of Censure, and Imprisonment: if He return'd neglected and affronted, as they presumed he would, they had a New reproach for the King, <Q>“”of protecting Delinquents against the Justice of Parliament;</Q> which would be a New breach of their Privi∣ledges, as Heinous and Unpopular, as had yet been made, and for the vindication whereof their Protestation would no less oblige them, than it had done on the behalf of the five Members. And such Votes they passed upon the return of their Officer; and had in readiness prepared two voluminous Declarations to the People, which they published about <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the same time; the One fill'd with all the reiterated complaints, and invenom'd repetitions, of what Had been done, or been Thought to have been done amiss in the whole Reign of the King, to render his Person odious, or unacceptable; the Other undervaluing his Royal Power, and declaring against it, to make his Authority despised, at least not Fear'd.</P>
<P>THE first was of the nineteenth of <HI>May,</HI> in which they declar'd,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Declara∣tion or Re∣monstrance of the Lords and Commons, <HI>May 19. 1642.</HI></NOTE> <Q>“”THAT the infinite Mercy, and Providence of the Allmighty God had been abundantly manifested, since the beginning of this Parlia∣ment, in great variety of Protections, and Blessings; whereby he had <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> not only deliver'd them from many wicked Plots and Designs, which, if they had taken effect, would have brought ruin and destruction upon the Kingdom; but, out of those attempts, had produced divers evi∣dent and remarkable advantages, to the furtherance of those Services, which they had been desirous to perform to their Soveraign Lord the King, and to the Church and State, in providing for the publick Peace, and Prosperity of his Majesty, and all his Realms; which, in the pre∣sence of the same All-seeing Deity, they protested to have been, and still to be, the only End of all their Counsels and Endeavours; wherein they had resolved to continue freed, and enlarged from all Private <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> aimes,</Q> Personal respects, or passions whatsoever.</P>
<P><Q>“”IN which resolution, they said, they were nothing discouraged, altho' the Heads of the Malignant Party disappointed of their Prey, the Religion and Liberty of the Kingdom, which they were ready to

<P><Q>“”FOR this purpose, they had drawn his Majesty into the Northern Parts far from the Parliament; that so false Rumours might have time to get Credit, and the just Defences of the Parliament find a more te∣dious, difficult, and disadvantageous access, after those false Imputa∣tions, and Slanders had been first rooted in the apprehension of his Ma∣jesty, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and his Subjects; which the more speedily to effect, they had caused a Press to be transported to <HI>York,</HI> from whence several Papers, and Writings of that kind were conveyed to all parts of the Kingdom, without the Authority of the Great Seal, in an Unusual and Illegal manner, and without the Advice of his Majesty's Privy Council; from the greater and better part whereof having withdrawn himself, as well as from his Great Council of Parliament, he was thereby exposed to the wicked and unfaithful Counsels of such, as had made the Wisdom and Justice of the Parliament dangerous to themselves; and that dan∣ger they labour'd to prevent by hiding their own Guilt under the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Name, and shadow of the King; infusing into him their own Fears, and, as much as in them lay, aspersing his Royal Person and Honour with their own Infamy; from both which it had allways been as much the Care, as it was the Duty of the Parliament to preserve his Majesty, and to fix the Guilt of all evil Actions and Counsels upon those, who had been the Authors of them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AMONG divers Writings of that kind, they said, They the Lords and Commons in Parliament, had taken into their considerations two Printed Papers; the first containing a Declaration, which they had re∣ceived from his Majesty in Answer to that which had been presented <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to his Majesty from both Houses at <HI>New-Market,</HI> the ninth of <HI>March</HI> 1641. the other, his Majesty's Answer to the Petition of both Houses, presented to his Majesty the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI> 1642.

<P><Q>“”ALTHO' they never desired, they said, to encourage his Majesty to such Replies as might produce any contestation between him and his Parliament, of which they never found better effect, than loss of Time, and hindrance of the Publick Affairs; yet they had been far from wiling him of how little value his Words would be with them, much less when they were accompanied with Actions of Love, and Justice. They said, he had more reason to find fault with those wicked Coun∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who had so often bereaved Him of the Honour, and his Peo∣ple of the Fruit of many gracious Speeches which he had made to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m▪ such as those in the end of the last Parliament; that, on the word of a King, and as he was a Gentleman, he would redress the Grievances of his People, as well out of Parliament, as in it. They asked, if the searching the Studies and Chambers, yea, the Pockets of some, both of the Nobility and Commons, the very next day; the Commit∣ment of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bellasis,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Crew;</HI> the continued Oppressions by Ship-money, Coat and Conduct-money; with the ma∣nifold Imprisonments, and other Vexations thereupon, and other en∣suing Violations of the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom (all which were the Effects of evil Counsel, and abundantly declar'd in their Re∣monstrance <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of the State of the Kingdom) were Actions of Love and Justice, suitable to such Words as those?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AS gracious was his Majesty's Speech in the beginning of this Par∣liament; that he was resolved to put himself freely and clearly upon the Love, and Affection of his English Subjects. They asked whether his causless Complaints and Jealousies, the unjust Imputations so often cast upon his Parliament, his denial of their necessary Defence by the Ordinance of the Militia, his dangerous absenting himself from his Great Council, like to produce such a mischievous Division in the Kingdom, had not been more suitable to Other men's evil Counsels, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> than to his own Words? Neither, they said, had his latter Speeches been better used, and preserved by those evil, and wicked Counsellors. Could any Words be fuller of Love and Justice, than those in his Answer to the Message sent to the House of Commons, the 31<SUP>st</SUP> of <HI>Decemb</HI> 16<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="428" REF="4460"/>
We do engage unto you solemnly the Word of a King, that the secu∣rity of all, and every one of you from Violence, is, and ever shall be, as much our Care, as the Preservation of Us and our Children? And could any Actions be fuller of Injustice and Violence, than that of the Atturney General, in falsly accusing the six Members of Parliament, and the other Proceedings thereupon, within three or four days after that Message? For the full view whereof, they desired the Declaration made of those Proceedings might be perused; and by those Instances (they could add many more) the World might judge who deserved to be taxed with disvaluing his Majesty's Words, they who had, as much <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> as in them lay, stain'd and sullied them with such foul Counsels; or the Parliament, who had ever manifested, with joy and delight, their humble Thankfulness for those gracious Words, and Actions of Love and Justice which had been conformable thereunto.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THE King, they said, had been pleased to Disavow the having, any such evil Counsel or Counsellors as were mention d in their Declara∣tion, to his Knowledge; and they held it their Duty humbly to Avow there were such; or else they must say, that all the ill things done of late in his Majesty's name, had been done by Himself; wherein they should neither follow the Direction of the Law, nor the affection of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> their own Hearts, which was, as much as might be, to clear his Ma∣jesty from all imputation of Misgovernment, and to lay the fault upon his Ministers. The false accusing of six Members of Parliament; the justifying M<SUP>r</SUP> Atturney in that false accusation; the violent coming to the House of Commons: the denial of the Militia; the sharp Mes∣sages to both Houses, contrary to the customs of former Kings; the long and remote Absence of his Majesty from Parliament; the heavy and wrongful Taxes upon both Houses; the cherishing and counte∣nancing a discontented Party in the Kingdom against them, were cer∣tainly the fruits of very evil Counsels, apt to put the Kingdom into <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> a Combustion, to hinder the supplies of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to countenance the Proceedings and pretensions of the Rebels there: and the Authors of these evil Counsels, they conceived, must needs be known to his Ma∣jesty; and they hoped Their labouring with his Majesty, to have those discovered and brought to a just Censure, would not so much wound his Honour in the opinion of his good Subjects, as His labouring to pre∣serve and conceal them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND whereas his Majesty had said, He could wish that his own im∣mediate Actions which he avow'd, and his own Honour might not be so roughly censured under the common Style of evil Counsellors; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> they said, that They could also heartily wish that they had not cause to make that Style so common; but how often, and undutifully so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ver, those wicked Counsellors should fix their Dishonour upon the King by making his Majesty the Author of those evil Actions, which were the effects of their own evil Counsels, They his Majesty's Loyal and Dutiful Subjects could use no other Style, according to that Maxim of the Law, <HI>the King can do no wrong;</HI> but if any Ill were committed in matter of State, the Council; if in matter of Justice, the Judges must answer for it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they had laid no Charge upon his Majesty, which should <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> put him upon that Apology, concerning his faithful and zealous Af∣fection of the Protestant Profession: Neither did his Majesty endea∣vour to clear those in greatest Authority about him, by whom they
<PB N="429" REF="4470"/>
had said that design had been potently carried on for divers years; and they rather wished that the Mercies of Heaven, than the Judgments, might be manifested upon them; but that there had been such, there were such plentiful and frequent Evidences, that they believed there was none, either Protestant or Papist, who had had any reasonable View of the Passages of latter Times, but, either in Fear or Hope, did expect a suddain issue of that Design.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they had no way transgressed against the Act of Obli∣vion, by remembring the intended War against <HI>Scotlamd,</HI> as a Branch <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of that Design to alter Religion by those wicked Counsels, from which God did then deliver them, which they ought never to forget.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THAT the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland</HI> was framed and cherished by the Popish, and Malignant Party in <HI>England,</HI> was not only affirm'd by the Rebels, but, they said, might be clear'd by many other Proofs: the same Rebellious Principles of pretended Religion, the same politick Ends were apparent in both, and their malicious Designs and Practices were masqued, and disguised with the same false colour of their earnest Zeal to vindicate his Majesty's Prerogative, from the supposed oppres∣sion of the Parliament. How much those treacherous Pretences had <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> been countenanced, by some evil Council about his Majesty, might appear in this, that the Proclamation, whereby they were declared Traitors, was so long withheld, as to the second of <HI>January,</HI> tho' the Rebellion broke forth in <HI>October</HI> before, and then no more than forty Copies appointed to be printed; with a special Command from his Ma∣jesty not to exceed that Number; and that none of them should be published, till his Majesty's pleasure was further signify'd, as by the Warrant appears, a true Copy whereof was annex'd to this Declara∣tion; so that a few only could take notice of it; which was made more observable, by the late contrary Proceedings against the Scots, who <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> were in a very quick and sharp manner Proclaimed; and those Procla∣mations forthwith dispersed, with as much diligence as might be, throughout all the Kingdom, and order'd to be read in all Churches, accompanied with Publick Prayers, and Execrations. Another Evi∣dence of favour and countenance to the Rebels in some of Power about his Majesty, was this, that they had put forth, in his Majesty's Name, a causless complaint against the Parliament, which speaks the same Language of the Parliament which the Rebels do, the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eby to raise a belief in men's minds, that his Majesty's Affections were alienated, as well as his Person was removed, from that his Great Council. All <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> which, they said, did exceedingly retard the supplies of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and more advance the Proceedings of the Rebels, than any Jealousy or mis∣apprehension begotten in his Subjects, by the Declaration of the Re∣bels, Injunction of <HI>Rosetti,</HI> or Information of <HI>Tristram Whetcomb;</HI> so that, considering the present State and Temper of both Kingdoms, his Royal Presence was far more necessary here, than it could be in <HI>Ireland,</HI> for redemption or protection of his Subjects there.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND whether there were Cause of his Majesty's great Indignation, for being reproached to have intended Force or Threatning to the Par∣liament, they desired them to consider who should read their Decla∣ration, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in which there was no word tending to any such reproach; and certainly, they said, they had been more tender of his Majesty's Ho∣nour in that Point, than he, whosoever he was, that did write that Declaration; where, in his Majesty's Name, he did call God to witness,
<PB N="430" REF="4480"/>
he never had any such Thought, or knew of any such Resolution of bringing up the Army; which truly, they said, would seem strange to those, who should read the Deposition of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Goring,</HI> the Informa∣tion of M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Percy,</HI> and divers other Examinations of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Wilmot,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Pollard,</HI> and others; the other Examination of Captain <HI>Leg,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jacob Ashley,</HI> and S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>John Conyers;</HI> and consider the condition and nature of the Petition, which was sent unto S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jacob Ashley,</HI> under the approbation of C.

<P><Q>“”THEY did not affirm that his Majesty's Warrant was granted for the Passage of M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Jermyn,</HI> after the desire of both Houses for restraint of his Servants; but only that he did pass over, after that restraint, by virtue of such a Warrant. They knew the Warrant bore date the day before their desire; yet, they said, it seem'd strange to those, who knew how great respect and power M <HI>Jermyn</HI> had in Court, that he should begin his Journey in such hast, and in Apparel so unfit for Tra∣vel, as a black Sattin Suit, and white Boots, if his going away was design▪d the day before. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THE Accusation of the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the five Members of the House of Commons, was called a Breach of Priviledge; and truly so it was, and a very high one, far above any satisfaction that had been yet given: for, they asked, how it could be said to be largely satisfy'd, so long as his Majesty labour'd to preserve M<SUP>•</SUP> Atturney from punish∣ment, who was the visible Actor in it? So long as his Majesty had not only justify'd him, but by his Letter declar▪d, that it was his Duty to accuse them, and that he would have punished him, if he had Not done it? So long as those Members had not the means of clearing their Innocency, and the Authors of that malicious Charge were un∣discover'd, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> tho' both Houses of Parliament had several times Petition'd his Majesty to discover them, and that, not only upon the grounds of Common Justice, but by Act of Parliament, his Majesty was bound to do it? So long as the King refused to pass a Bill for their discharge, alledging that the Narrative in that Bill was against his Honour; where<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y he seem'd still to avow the Matter of that false and scanda∣lous Accusation, tho' he deserted the Prosecution, offering to pass a Bill for their Acquittal; yet with intimation that they must desert the avowing their own Innocency, which would more wound them in Honour, than secure them in Law? And in Vindication of that great <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Priviledge of Parliament, they did not know that they had invaded any Priviledge belonging to his Majesty, as had been alledg'd in that Declaration.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BuT, they said, they looked not upon that only in the notion of a Breach of Priviledge, which might be, tho' the Accusation were true or false; but under the notion of a heinous Crime in the Atturney, and all other Subjects, who had a hand in it; a Crime against the Law of Nature, against the Rules of Justice; that Innocent men should be charged with so great an offence as Treason, in the face of the highest Judicatory of the Kingdom, whereby their Lives and Estates, their <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Blood and Honour were endanger'd, without Witness, without Evi∣dence, without all possibility of Reparation in a legal Course; yet a Crime of such a nature, that his Majesty▪s Command can no more
<PB N="431" REF="4490"/>
warrant, than it can any other Act of Injustice. These things which were evil in their own nature, such as a false Testimony or false Ac∣cusation, could not be the subject of any Command, or induce any Obligation of Obedience upon any man, by any Authority whatsoever: therefore the Atturney, in that case, was bound to have refused to execute such a Command, unless he had some such Evidence or Testi∣mony, as might have warranted him against the Parties, and be liable to make satisfaction if it should prove false; and it was sufficiently known to every man, and adjudg'd in Parliament, that the King could <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> be neither the Relator, Informer, or Witness. If it should rest as it was without further satisfaction, no future Parliament could be safe, but that the Members might be taken, and destroy'd, at pleasure; yea the very principles of Government, and Justice would be in danger to be dissolved.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they did not conceive, that Numbers did make an As∣sembly unlawful, but when either the end, or manner of their carriage should be unlawful. Divers just Occasions might draw the Citizens to <HI>Westminster;</HI> where many publick and private Petitions, and other Causes were depending in Parliament; and why that should be found <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> more faulty in the Citizens, than the resort every day in the Term of great Numbers to the ordinary Courts of Justice, they knew not: that those Citizens were notoriously provoked, and assaulted at <HI>Westminster</HI> by Colonel <HI>Lunsford,</HI> Captain <HI>Hyde,</HI> and others, and by some of the Servants of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> was sufficiently proved; and that afterwards they were more violently wounded, and most barbarously mangled with Swords, by the Officers and Soldiers near <HI>White-Hall,</HI> many of them being without Weapons, and giving no cause of distast, was likewise proved by several Testimonies; but of any scandalous or seditious misdemeanours of Theirs, that might give his Majesty good <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> cause to suppose his own Person, or those of his Royal Consort or Children, to be in apparent danger, they had no proof ever offer'd to either House; and if there had been any complaint of that kind, it was no doubt the Houses would have been as forward to joyn in an Order, for the suppressing of such Tumults, as they were, not long before, upon another occasion, when they made an Order to that purpose; whereas those Officers and Soldiers, which committed that Violence upon so many of the Citizens at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> were cherish'd and foster'd in his Majesty's House; and when, not long after, the Common Coun∣cil of <HI>London</HI> presented a Petition to his Majesty for reparation of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> those Injuries, his Majesty's Answer was, without hearing the proof of the Complaints, that if any Citizen were wounded or ill entreated, his Majesty was confidently assured, that it happen'd by their own evil, and corrupt Demeanours.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they hoped, it could not be thought contrary to the Duty and Wisdom of a Parliament, if many concurring, and frequently reiterated, and renew'd Advertisements from <HI>Rome, Venice, Paris,</HI> and other Parts; if the Sollicitations of the Pope's Nuncio, and their own discontented Fugitives, did make them jealous, and watchful for the safety of the State: and they had been very careful to make their ex∣pressions <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> thereof so easy, and so plain to the Capacity and Understand∣ing of the People, that nothing might justly stick with them, with Reflection upon the Person of his Majesty: wherein they appeal'd to the judgment of any indifferent Person, who should read and peruse their own words.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="4500"/>
<Q>“”THEY said, they must maintain the ground of their Fears to be of that moment, that they could not discharge the Trust and Duty that lay upon them, unless they did apply themselves to the use of those means, to which the Law had enabled them in cases of that nature, for the necessary Defence of the Kingdom; and as his Majesty did gra∣ciously declare, that the Law should be the measure of his Power; so did they most heartily profess, that they should allways make it the Rule of their Obedience. Then they observed, that there were cer∣tain Prudent Omissions in his Majesty's Answer; and said, that the next Point of their Declaration, was, with much caution, artificially <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> passed over by him, who drew his Majesty's Answer; it being indeed the Foundation of all Their misery, and his Majesty's trouble, that he was pleased to hear general Taxes upon his Parliament, without any particular Charge, to which they might give satisfaction; and that he had often conceived Displeasure against particular Persons, upon Mis∣information; and altho' those Informations had been clearly proved to be false, yet he would never bring the Accusers to question; which did lay an impossibility upon honest men of clearing themselves, and gave an encouragement to false, and unworthy Persons to trouble him with untrue and groundless Informations. Three particulars they had <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> mention'd in their Declaration, which the Penner of his Majesty's An∣swer had good cause to omit: the Words supposed to have been spoken at <HI>Kensington;</HI> the pretended Articles against the Queen; and the groundless Accusation of the six Members of Parliament; there being nothing to be said in Defence, or Denial of any of them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”CONCERNING his Majesty's desire to joyn with his Parliament, and with his faithful Subjects, in defence of Religion, and the publick Good of the Kingdom, they said, they doubted not he would do it fully, when evil Counsellors should be removed from about him; and until That should be, as they had shew'd before of Words, so must they also <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> say of Laws, that They could not secure them: witness the Petition of Right, which had been follow'd with such an Inundation of illegal Taxes, that they had just cause to think, that the payment of eight hundred and twenty thousand pounds, was an easy burthen to the Common-wealth in exchange of them; and they could not but justly think, that if there were a continuance of such ill Counsellors, and Fa∣vour to them, they would, by some wicked Device or other, make the Bill for the Triennial Parliament, and those other excellent Laws men∣tion'd in his Majesty's Declaration, of less value than Words. That excellent Bill for the continuance of this Parliament, they said, was so <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> necessary, that without it, they could not have raised so great Sums of Money for the Service of his Majesty and the Common-wealth, as they had done, and without which the ruin and destruction of the King∣dom, must needs have follow'd: and, they were resolved, the gracious favour of his Majesty, expressed in that Bill, and the advantage and se∣curity which thereby they had from being Dissolved, should not en∣courage them to do any thing, which otherwise had not been fit to have been done. And they were ready to make it good before all the world, that tho' his Majesty had passed many Bills very advantageous for the Subject, yet in none of them had they bereaved his Majesty <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of any just, necessary, or profitable Prerogative of the Crown.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said▪ they so earnestly desired his Majesty's Return to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> for that upon It, they conceived, depended the very Safety, and
<PB N="433" REF="4510"/>
Being of both his Kingdoms: and therefore they must protest, that as for the time past, neither the Government of <HI>London,</HI> nor any Laws of the Land, had lost their Life and Force for his security, so for the Future they should be ready to Do, or Say any thing, that might stand with the Duty, or Honour of a Parliament, which might raise a mu∣tual Confidence between his Majesty and them, as They did wish, and as the Affairs of the Kingdom did require.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THUS far, they said, the Answer to that, which was called his Ma∣jesty's Declaration, had led them. Now they came to that, which was <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> entituled his Majesty's Answer to the Petition of both Houses, pre∣sented to him at <HI>York</HI> the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March</HI> 1642. In the beginning whereof, his Majesty wished, that their Priviledges on all parts were so stated, that That way of Correspondency might be preserved with that Freedom, which had been used of old. They said, they knew no∣thing introduced by them, that gave any Impediment thereunto; nei∣ther had they affirm'd their Priviledges to be broken, when his Ma∣jesty denied them any thing, or gave a Reason, why he could not grant it; or that those, who advised such Denial, were Enemies to the Peace of the Kingdom, and Favourers of the Irish Rebellion; in which <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Aspersion, that was turn'd to a general assertion, which, in their Votes, was applied to a Particular case; wherefore they must maintain their Votes, that to contradict That, which both Houses, in the Question concerning the Militia, had declared to be Law, and Command it should not be obeyed, is a high breach of Priviledge, and that those, who advised his Majesty to absent himself from his Parliament, were Enemies to the Peace of the Kingdom, and justly to be suspected to be Favourers of the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland.</HI> The reasons of both were Evident, because, in the First, there was as great a derogation from the Trust and Authority of Parliament; and, in the Second, as much <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> advantage to the proceedings, and hopes of the Rebels, as might be; and they held it a very causless Imputation upon the Parliament, that they had therein any way impeached, much less taken away the free∣dom of his Majesty's Vote; which did not import a liberty in his Ma∣jesty, to deny Any thing how necessary soever for the Preservation of the Kingdom, much less a Licence to evil Counsellors, to advise any thing, tho' never so destructive to his Majesty and his People.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BY the Message of the twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> his Majesty had pro∣pounded to both Houses of Parliament, that they would, with all speed, fall into a serious consideration of all those Particulars which <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> they thought necessary, as well for the upholding and maintaining of his Majesty's Just, and Regal Authority, and for the settling his Re∣venue, as for the present and future establishing their Priviledges; the free and quiet enjoying their Estates; the Liberties of their Persons; the security of the true Religion, professed in the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and the settling of Ceremonies, in such a manner, as might take away all just Offence, and digest it into one entire Body.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”To that point of upholding, and maintaining his Royal Authority, they said, nothing had been done to the prejudice of it, that should require any new Provision: To the other of settling the Revenue, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the Parliament had no way abridg'd, or disorder'd his just revenue; but it was true, that much Waste, and Confusion of his Majesty's Estate, had been made by those evil and unfaithful Ministers, whom he had imploy'd in the managing of it; whereby his own ordinary Expences
<PB N="434" REF="4520"/>
would have been disappointed, and the safety of the Kingdom more endanger'd if the Parliament had not, in some measure, provided for his Houshold, and for some of the Forts, more than they were bound to do; and they were still willing to settle such a Revenue upon his Majesty, as might make him live Royally, Plentifully, and Safely; but they could not, in wisdom, and fidelity to the Common-wealth, do that, till he should chose such Counsellors and Officers, as might order and dispose it to the publick Good, and not apply it to the ruin, and destruction of his People, as heretofore it had been. But that, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and the other matters concerning themselves, being works of great im∣portance, and full of intricacy, would require so long a time of Deli∣beration, that the Kingdom might be ruin▪d before they could effect them: Therefore they thought it necessary, first to be Suitors to his Majesty, so to order the Militia, that, the Kingdom being secured, they might, with more ease and safety▪ apply themselves to debate of that Message, wherein they had been interrupted, by his Majesty's de∣nial of the Ordinance concerning the same; because it would have been in vain for them to Labour in other things, and in the mean time, to leave themselves naked to the malice of so many Enemies, both at home and abroad; yet they had not been alltogether negligent <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of those things, which his Majesty had been pleased to propound in that Message: They had agreed upon a Book of Rates in a larger pro∣portion, than had been granted to any of his Majesty Predecessors, which was a considerable support of his Majesty's publick charge; and had likewise prepared divers Propositions, and Bills, for preservation of their Religion and Liberties, which they intended shortly to present to his Majesty; and to do whatsoever was fit for them, to make up that unpleasant breach between his Majesty and the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WHEREAS divers exceptions had been taken concerning the Mi∣litia; first, that his Majesty never denied the Thing, but accepted the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Persons (except for Corporations) only that he denied the Way; to which they Answer'd, That that Exception took off <HI>London,</HI> and all other great Towns and Cities, which make a great part of the King∣dom; and for the way of Ordinance, it is ancient, more speedy, more easily alterable, and in all these, and other respects, more proper, and more applicable to the present occasion, than a Bill; which his Majesty called, the good old way of imposing upon the Subjects. It should seem, that neither his Majesty's Royal Predecessors, nor their An∣cestors, had heretofore been of that opinion; 39 <HI>Ed.</HI> III. they said, they found this Record, The Chancellor made Declaration of the Challenge <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of the Parliament; the King desires to know the griefs of his Subjects, and to redress Enormities. The last day of the Parliament, the King demanded of the whole Estates, whether they would have such things as they agreed on, by way of Ordinance or Statute? who Answer'd by way of Ordinance, for that they might amend the same at their plea∣sures; and so it was.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT his Majesty objected further, that there was somewhat in the Preface, to which he could not consent with justice to his Honour and Innocence; and that thereby he was Excluded from any power in the disposing of it. These objections, they said, might seem somewhat, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> but indeed would appear nothing, when it should be consider'd, that nothing in the Preamble laid any charge upon his Majesty, or in the body of the Ordinance, that excludes his Royal Authority in the
<PB N="435" REF="4530"/>
disposing, or execution of it: But only it was provided, that it should be signify'd by both Houses of Parliament, as that Channel, through which it would be best derived, and most certainly to those ends for which it was intended; and let all the world judge whether they had not reason to insist upon it, that the strength of the Kingdom should rather be order▪d according to the Advice, or Direction of the great Council of the Land, intrusted by the King, and by the Kingdom, than that the safety of the King, Parliament, and Kingdom, should be left at the devotion of a few unknown Counsellors, many of them not in∣trusted <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> at all by the King in any publick way, nor at all Confided in by the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY wished the Danger were not Imminent, or not still conti∣nuing, but could not conceive, that the long time spent in that de∣bate was evidence sufficient, that there was no such necessity or dan∣ger, but a Bill might easily have been prepared; for, when many causes do concur to the danger of a State, the interruption of any one might hinder the execution of the rest, and yet the design be still kept on foot, for better opportunities. Who knew, whether the ill success of the Rebels in <HI>Ireland</HI> had not hinder'd the Insurrection of the Papists <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> here? Whether the preservation of the six Members of the Parliament, falsly accused, had not prevented that Plot of the breaking the neck of this Parliament, of which they were informed from <HI>France,</HI> not long before they were accused; Yet since his Majesty had been pleased to express his pleasure rather for a Bill, than an Ordinance, and that he sent in one for that purpose, they readily entertain'd it; and, with some small and necessary alterations, speedily passed the same. But contrary to the custom of Parliament, and their expectation, grounded upon his Majesty's own Invitation of them to that way, and other rea∣sons manifested in their Declaration concerning the Militia, of the fifth <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of <HI>May,</HI> instead of the Royal Assent, they met with an absolute Refusal.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR their Votes of the fifteenth and sixteenth of <HI>March,</HI> they said, if the Matter of those Votes were according to Law, they hoped his Majesty would allow the Subjects to be bound by them, because he had said, he would make the Law the Rule of his power; and if the Question were, whether that were Law, which the Lords and Com∣mons had once declar'd to be so, who should be the judge? Not his Majesty; for the King judgeth not of Matters of Law, but by his Courts; and his Courts, tho' sitting by His Authority, expected not his Assent in Matters of Law: nor any other Courts; for they could <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> not judge in that case, because they were Inferiour, no Appeal lying to them from Parliament, the judgment whereof is, in the eye of the Law, the King's judgment in his highest Court, tho' the King in his Person be neither present, nor assenting thereunto.</Q></P>
<Q><L>"The Votes at which his Majesty took exception were these:</L></Q>
<P N="1">1. <Q>“”THAT the King's Absence so far remote from his Parliament, was not only an Obstruction, but might prove a Destruction to the Affairs of <HI>Ireland.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2"><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> 2. <Q>“”THAT when the Lords and Commons shall declare what the Law of the Land is, to have this not only question'd and controverted, but contradicted, and a Command that it should Not be obeyed, was a high Breach of the Priviledge of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="436" REF="4540"/>
3. <Q>“”THAT those Persons, who advised his Majesty to absent him∣self from the Parliament, are Enemies to the Peace of the Kingdom, and justly may be suspected to be favourers of the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THAT the Kingdom had been of late, and still was, in so Imminent danger, both from Enemies abroad, and from a Popish and Discon∣tented Party at home, that there was an urgent, and inevitable ne∣cessity of putting his Majesty's Subjects into a posture of Defence, for the safeguard both of his Majesty and his People.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THAT the Lords and Commons, fully apprehending this Danger, and being sensible of their own Duty, to provide a suitable Prevention, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> had, in several Petitions, addressed themselves to his Majesty for the ordering, and disposing the Militia of the Kingdom in such a way, as was agreed upon, by the wisdom of both Houses, to be most effectual, and proper for the present Exigence of the Kingdom, yet could not obtain it; but his Majesty did, several times, refuse to give his Royal Assent thereunto.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THAT, in this case of extreme Danger and his Majesty's Refusal, the Ordinance of Parliament, agreed upon by both Houses, for the Militia, doth oblige the People, and ought to be obeyed, by the Fun∣damental Laws of this Kingdom. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BY all which, they said, it did appear, that there had been no co∣lour of that Tax, that they went about to introduce a new Law, much less to exercise an Arbitrary power, but indeed to prevent it: for this Law was as old as the Kingdom; that the Kingdom must not be with∣out a means to preserve it self: which that it might be done without confusion, this Nation had intrusted certain Hands with Power to pro∣vide, in an orderly and regular way, for the Good and Safety of the Whole; which Power, by the Constitution of the Kingdom, was in his Majesty, and in his Parliament together: yet since the Prince, be∣ing <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> but one Person, is more subject to accidents of Nature and Chance, whereby the Common-wealth may be deprived of the Fruit of that Trust, which was in part reposed in him; in cases of such Necessity, that the Kingdom may not be inforced presently to return to it's first Principles, and every man left to do what is right in his own Eyes, without either Guide or Rule; the Wisdom of this State hath intrusted the Houses of Parliament with a power to supply, what should be wanting on the part of the Prince, as is evident by the constant Custom, and Practice thereof, in cases of Nonage, natural Disability, and Capti∣vity; and the like reason doth, and must hold for the exercise of the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> same Power in such cases, where the Royal Trust cannot be, or is not discharged, and that the Kingdom runs an Evident, and Imminent Danger thereby; which Danger having been declar'd by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, there needs not the Authority of any Person or Court to affirm, nor is it in the power of any Person or Court to revoke, that Judgment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they knew, the King had ways enough, in his ordinary Courts of Justice, to punish such seditious Pamphlets and Sermons, as were any ways prejudicial to his Rights, Honour, and Authority; and if any of them had been so insolently violated and vilify'd, his Majesty's <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> own Council and Officers had been to blame, and not the Parliament: They never had restrain'd any proceedings of that kind in other Courts, nor refused any fit complaint to Them. The Protestation protested,
<PB N="437" REF="4550"/>
had been referred by the Commons House to a Committee, and, the Author being not produced, the Printer committed to Prison, and the Book Voted by that Committee to be burn'd; but S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Edward Deering,</HI> who was to make that Report of the Votes of that Committee, neglect∣ed to make it. The Apprentices Protestation was never complain'd of; but the other seditious Pamphlet, <HI>To your Tents O Israel,</HI> was once question'd, and the full prosecution of it was not interrupted by any fault of either House, whose forwardness to do his Majesty all right therein might plainly appear, in that a Committee of Lords and Com∣mons <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> was purposely appointed, to take such Informations as the King's Council should present concerning seditious Words, Practices or Tu∣mults, Pamphlets or Sermons, tending to the derogation of his Ma∣jesty's Rights or Prerogative, and his Council had been enjoyn'd by that Committee, to enquire and present them; who several times met thereupon, and received this Answer and Declaration from the King's Council, that they knew of no such thing as yet.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, if his Majesty had used the service of such a One in penning that Answer, who understood the Laws and Government of this Kingdom, he would not have thought it Legally in his power to <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> deny his Parliament a Guard, when they stood in need of it; since every ordinary Court hath it: neither would his Majesty, if he had been well informed of the Laws, have refused such a Guard as they desired, it being in the power of Inferiour Courts to command their own Guard; neither would he have imposed upon them such a Guard, under a Commander which they could not have Confided in; which is clearly against the Priviledges of Parliament, and of which they found very dangerous effects; and therefore desired to have it dis∣charged; But such a Guard, and so Commanded, as the Houses of Par∣liament desired, they could never obtain of his Majesty; and the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> placing a Guard about them, contrary to their desire, was not to grant a Guard to them, but in effect to set one Upon them: all which con∣sider'd, they believed, in the judgment of any Indifferent Persons, it would not be thought strange, if there were a more than ordinary re∣sort of People to <HI>Westminster,</HI> of such as came willingly, of their own accord, to be Witnesses, and Helpers of the safety of Them, whom all his Majesty's good Subjects are bound to defend from Violence, and Danger; or that such a Concourse as that (they carrying themselves quietly and peaceably, as they did) ought in his Majesty's apprehen∣sion, or could, in the interpretation of the Law, be held Tumultuary <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and Seditious.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said when his Majesty, in that Question of Violation of the Laws, had expressed the observation of them indefinitely, without any limitation of Time, altho' they never said, or thought any thing, that might look like a Reproach to his Majesty, yet they had reason to re∣member that it had been otherwise, lest they should seem to desert their former Complaints, and Proceedings thereupon, as his Majesty did seem but little to like or approve them; for tho' he did acknow∣ledge here that great Mischief, that grew by that Arbitrary Power then complain'd of; yet such were continually preferred and counte∣nanced, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> as were Friends, or Favourers, or Related to chief Authors and Actors of that Arbitrary Power, and, of those false colours, and suggestions of Imminent danger and necessity, whereby they did make it plausible unto his Majesty: and, on the other side, such, as did appear
<PB N="438" REF="4560"/>
against them were daily discountenanced, and disgraced: which whilst it should be so, they had no reason to believe the disease to be yet killed, and dead at Root, and therefore no Reason to bury it in Oblivion; and, whilst they beheld the Spawns of those mischievous Principles cherished, and foster'd in that new generation of Counsellors, Friends and Abettors of the former, or at least Concurring with them in their Malignancy against the proceeding of this Parliament, they could not think themselves secure from the like, or a worse danger.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY observed, the Penner of his Majesty's Answer bestowed here an admonition upon the Parliament, bidding them take heed They <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> fell not upon the same errour, upon the same suggestions; but, they said, he might well have spared that, till he could have shewed wherein they had exercised any power, otherwise than by the Rule of the Law; or could have found a more Authentick, or a Higher Judge in matters of Law, than the high Court of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”IT was declared, in his Majesty's Name, that he resolv'd to keep the Rule Himself, and, to his power, to require the same of all others. They said, they must needs acknowledge, that such a resolution was like to bring much happiness, and blessing to his Majesty, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll his Kingdoms; yet, with humility, they must confess, they had not the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Fruit of it in that Case of the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the other five Mem∣bers, accused contrary to Law, both Common and the Statute Law; and yet remained unsatisfy'd: Which Case had been remember'd, in their Declaration, as a strange and unheard of Violation of their Laws: But the Penner of that Answer thought fit to pass it over, hoping that many would read his Majesty's Answer, which had been so carefully dispersed, who would not read their Declaration.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WHEREAS, after their ample thanks, and acknowledgment of his Majesty's favour in passing many good Bills, they had said, that truth and necessity inforced them to add this, that in, or about the time of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> passing those Bills, some Design or other had been on foot, which, if it had taken effect, would not only have deprived them of the Fruit of those Bills, but would have reduced them to a worse condition of con∣fusion, than that wherein the Parliament found them: it was now told them, that the King must be most sensible of what they had cast upon him, for the requital of those good Bills; whereas, out of their usual tenderness of his Majesty's honour, they did not mention Him at all; but so injurious, they said, were those wicked Counsellors to the Name, and Honour of their Master and Soveraign, that, as much as they could, they laid their own Infamy and Guilt upon His Shoulders. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HERE, they observ▪d, God also was called to witness his Majesty's upright intentions at the passing of those Laws; which, they said, they would not question, neither did they give any occasion for such a solemn Asseveration, as that was; the Devil was likewise defied to prove there was any design, with his Majesty's knowledge or privity. That might well have been spared; for they spake nothing of his Ma∣jesty: but since they were so far taxed, as to have it affirmed, that they had laid a false, and notorious Imputation upon his Majesty, they thought it necessary, for the just defence of their own Innocency, to cause the Oaths and Examinations, which had been taken, concerning <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the Design, to be published in a full Narration, for satisfaction of all his Majesty's Subjects; out of which they would now offer some few Particulars, by which the world might judge, whether they could
<PB N="439" REF="4570"/>
proceed with more tenderness towards his Majesty, than they had done. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Goring</HI> confessed, that the King first asked him, whether he were engaged in any Cabal concerning the Army? and commanded him to joyn with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Percy,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jermyn,</HI> and some others whom they should find at M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Percy</HI>'s Chamber; where they took the Oath of Se∣crecy, and then debated of a design proposed by M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jermyn,</HI> to secure the Tower, and to consider of bringing up the Army to <HI>London:</HI> and Captain <HI>Leg</HI> confessed, he had received the draught of a Petition, in the King's presence; and his Majesty acknowledgeth, it was from his <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> own Hand: and whosoever reads the Sum of that Petition, as it was proved by the Testmony of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jacob Ashley,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Conyers,</HI> and Captain <HI>Leg,</HI> will easily perceive some Points in it, apt to beget in them some Discontents against the Parliament. And could any man believe there was no Design in the Accusation of the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the rest, in which his Majesty doth avow himself to be both a Com∣mander, and an Actor? These things being so, it would easily appear to be as much against the Rules of Prudence, that the Penner of that Answer should entangle his Majesty in that unnecessary Apology, as it was against the Rules of Justice, that any Reparation from Them <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> should be either yielded, or demanded.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”IT was professed, in his Majesty's Name, that he is truly sensible of the Burthens of his People; which made them hope, that he would take that course, which would be most effectual to ease them of those burthens, that was, to joyn with his Parliament in preserving the Peace of the Kingdom, which, by his Absence from them, had been much endanger'd; and which, by hindering the voluntary Adventures for the recovery of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and disabling the Subjects to discharge the great Tax imposed on them, was like to make the War much more heavy to the Kingdom. And for his Majesty's Wants, the Parliament <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> had been no cause of them; They had not diminished his just Revenue, but had much eased his Publick Charge, and somewhat his Private; and they should be ready, in a Parliamentary way, to settle his Re∣venue in such an Honourable proportion, as might be answerable to both, when he should put himself into such a posture of Government, that his Subjects might be secure to enjoy his just Protection for their Religion, Laws, and Liberties.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they never refused his Majesty's gracious Offer, of a free and general Pardon, only they said, it could be no security to their present Fears and Jealousies: and they gave a Reason for it; that those Fears did not arise out of any Guilt of their own Actions, but out of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the evil Designs and Attempts of others; and they left the world to judge, whether They therein had deserved so heavy a Tax and Excla∣mation? (That it was a strange world, when Princes proffer'd Favours were counted Reproaches: such were the words of his Majesty's An∣swer) who did esteem that Offer as an Act of Princely Grace and Boun∣ty, which, since the Parliament begun, they had humbly desired they might obtain, and did still hold it very necessary, and advantageous for the generality of the Subject, upon whom the Taxes and Subsidies lie heaviest: but, they said, they saw, upon every Occasion, how unhap∣py they were in his Majesty's misapprehensions of their Words, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Actions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they were fully of the King's mind, as it was there de∣clared, that he might rest so secure of the Affections of his Subjects,
<PB N="440" REF="4580"/>
that he should not stand in need of Forreign Force to preserve him from Oppression; and were confident, that he should never want an abundant evidence of the good Wishes, and Assistance of his Whole Kingdom; especially if he would be pleased to hold to that gracious Resolution of building upon that sure Foundation, the Law of the Land; but why his Majesty should take it ill, that they, having re∣ceived Informations so deeply concerning the safety of the Kingdom, should think them fit to be consider'd of, they could not conceive; for altho the Name of the Person was unknown, yet that which was more substantial to the probability of the report was known, that is, that he <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> was servant to the Lord <HI>Digby;</HI> who, in his presumptuous Letter to the Queen's Majesty, and other Letters to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lewis Dives,</HI> had inti∣mated some wicked Proposition, suitable to that Information; but that this should require Reparation, they held it as far from Justice, as it was from Truth that they had mixed any Malice with those Rumours, thereby to feed the Fears and Jealousies of the People.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”IT was affirmed, that his Majesty was driven From them, but not By them; yet perchance, they said, hereafter, if there should be op∣portunity of gaming more credit, there would not be wanting who would suggest unto his Majesty, that it was done By them: and if his <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Majesty were driven from them, they hoped it was not by his own Fears, but by the Fears of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and his Retinue of Cava∣liers; and those no Fears of any Tumultuary violence, but of their just punishment for their manifold insolence, and intended violence against the Parliament: And this was expressed by the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> himself, when he told those Cavaliers, that the principal cause of his Majesty's going out of Town, was to save Them from being trampled in the Dirt: but of his Majesty's Person, there was no cause of fear; in the greatest heat of the Peoples Indignation, after the Accusation, and his Majesty's violent coming to the House, there was no shew of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> any evil Intention against his Regal Person; of which there could be no better Evidence than this, that he came the next day without a Guard into the City, where he heard nothing but Prayers and Petitions, no Threatnings, or irreverent Speeches, that might give him any just occasions of fear, that They had heard of, or that his Majesty expressed; for he staid near a week after at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> in a secure and peaceable condition: whereby they were induced to believe, that there was no difficulty, or doubt at all, but his Majesty's residence near <HI>London</HI> might be as safe, as in any part of the Kingdom. They said, they were most assured of the faithfulness of the City, and Suburbs; and for Them∣selves, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> they should quicken the Vigour of the Laws, and Industry of the Magistrate, the Authority of Parliament, for the suppressing of all Tumultuary insolency whatsoever, and, for the vindicating of his Ho∣nour from all insupportable and insolent Scandals, if any such shall be found to be raised upon him, as were mention'd in that Answer: and therefore they thought it alltogether unnecessary, and exceeding in∣convenient, to Adjourn the Parliament to any other place.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WHERE the desire of a good understanding betwixt the King and Parliament, was on both sides so earnest, as was there professed by his Majesty to be in Him, and they had sufficiently testify'd to be in <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Themselves, it seem'd strange they should be, they said, so long asunder; it could be nothing else but evil and malicious Counsel in misrepresenting their Carriage to his Majesty, and in disposing his
<PB N="441" REF="4590"/>
favour to Them. And as it should be far from them to take any ad∣vantage of his Majesty's supposed streights, as to desire, much less to Compel him to that, which his Honour or Interest might render un∣pleasant, or grievous to him; so, they hoped, his Majesty would not make his own Understanding or Reason the Rule of his Government; but would suffer himself to be assisted with a wise and prudent Council, that might deal faithfully betwixt Him and his People: and that he would remember, that His Resolutions did concern Kingdoms; and therefore ought not to be molded by his own, much less by any Pri∣vate <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Person, which was not alike proportionable to so great a Trust: And therefore they still desired and hoped, that his Majesty would not be guided by his own understanding, or think those courses, Streights and Necessities, to which he should be advised by the Wisdom of both Houses of Parliament, which are the Eyes in the Politick Body, where by his Majesty was, by the Constitution of the Kingdom, to discern the differences of those things, which concern the Publick Peace and Safety thereof.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they had given his Majesty no cause to say, that they did meanly value the discharge of his publick duty; whatsoever Acts <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of Grace or Justice had been done, they proceeded from his Majesty by the Advice and Counsel of his Parliament, yet they had and should allways Answer them with constant gratitude, and obedience, and af∣fection; and altho' many things had been done, since this Parliament, of another nature, yet they should not cease to desire the continued Protection of Allmighty God upon his Majesty, and most humbly Pe∣tition him to cast from him all those evil, and contrary Counsels, which had, in many Particulars formerly mention'd, much detracted from the Honour of his Government, the Happiness of his own Estate, and Prosperity of his People.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND having passed so many Dangers from abroad, so many Con∣spiracies at home, and brought on the publick Work so far, through the greatest difficulties that ever stood in opposition to a Parliament, to such a degree of success, that nothing seem'd to be left in the way able to hinder the full Accomplishment of their Desires, and Endea∣vours for the publick Good, unless God in his Justice did send a grievous curse upon them, as to turn the strength of the Kingdom against it self, and to effect that by their own Folly and Credulity, which the Power and Subtilty of their Enemies could not attain, that was, to divide the People from the Parliament, and to make them serviceable to the Ends, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and Aimes of those who would destroy them: Therefore they desired the Kingdom to take notice of that last most desperate, and mischievous Plot of the Malignant Party, that was acted and prosecuted in many parts of the Kingdom, under plausible notions of stirring them up to a care of preserving the King's Prerogative; maintaining the Discipline of the Church; upholding and continuing the Reverence, and Solem∣nity of God's Service; and encouraging of Learning: And, upon those grounds, divers mutinous Petitions had been framed in <HI>London, Kent,</HI> and other Counties; and sundry of his Majesty's Subjects, had been sollicited to declare themselves for the King against the Parliament; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and many false and foul Aspersions had been cast upon their Proceed∣ings, as if they had been not only negligent, but averse in those Points; whereas they desired nothing more, than to maintain the purity and power of Religion, and to honour the King in all his just Prerogatives;
<PB N="442" REF="4600"/>
and for encouragement and advancement of Piety and Learning, they had very earnestly endeavoured, and still did, to the utmost of their power, that all Parishes might have Learned, Pious, and Sufficient Preachers, and all such Preachers, competent Livings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”MANY other Bills and Propositions, they said, were in preparation, for the King's profit and honour, the Peoples safety and prosperity; in the proceedings whereof, they were much hinder'd by his Majesty's Absence from the Parliament; which was alltogether contrary to the Use of his Predecessors, and the Priviledge of Parliament, whereby their Time was consumed by a multitude of unnecessary Messages, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> their Innocency wounded by causless and sharp Invectives; yet they doubted not but they should overcome all this at last, if the People suffer not themselves to be deluded with false and specious shews, and so drawn to betray Them to their own undoing, who had ever been willing to hazard the undoing of themselves, that They might not be betrayed, by their neglect of the Trust reposed in them: But if it were not possible they should prevail herein, yet they would not fail, through God s Grace, still to persist in their Duties, and to look beyond their own Lives, Estates, and Advantages, as those who think nothing worth the enjoying without the Liberty, Peace, and Safety of the Kingdom; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> nor any thing too good to be hazarded, in discharge of their Con∣sciences, for the obtaining of it: And should allways repose them∣selves upon the Protection of Allmighty God, which, they were confi∣dent, should never be wanting to them (while they sought His Glory) as they had found it, hitherto, wonderfully going along with them, in all their Proceedings.</Q></P>
<P>WITH this Declaration they publish'd the Examinations of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Goring,</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Percy</HI>'s Letter to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> which were the great Evidence they had of the Plot of bringing up the Army, to awe the Parliament; and several other Letters and Depositions, or rather <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> such parts of Depositions, as contributed most to their purpose. For the truth is, as they never publishd, so much as to the Houses which were to Judge, many Depositions of Witnesses, whose Testimonies, in a manner, vindicated the King from those Aspersions, which they had a mind should stick upon him (for many such there were) so of those which they did publish, they left out many parts, which, being added, would either have obscured, or contradicted, or discredited much of that, out of which they made the People believe much to the King's dis∣service. And yet with all those ill Arts and Omissions, I presume many, who without passion do now read those Depositions (for they are in all <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> hands to be read) do much marvel how such conclusions could result to his Majesty's disadvantage, out of the worst part of all that Evidence; which could not, naturally, carry that sense to which it was wrested.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time (which I shall mention before the other Declara∣tion▪ because it interven'd) there happen'd an Accident that gave them much trouble, and the more, because unlooked for, by the Lord Keeper's quitting them and resorting to <HI>York,</HI> by which the King got the posses∣sion of his own Great Seal; which by all Parties was, at that time, thought a most considerable advantage. The King was very much unsatisfy'd with the Lord Keeper <HI>Littleton;</HI> who did not appear so useful for his <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Service as he expected, and, from the time of the Accusing the Mem∣bers, had lost all his Vigour, and instead of making any oppositions to any of their extravagant Debates, he had silently suffer'd all things to
<PB N="443" REF="4610"/>
be carried; and had not only declined the performing the Office the King had enjoyn'd him, with reference to the Earls of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> (be∣fore mention'd) but very much complied with, and courted that Party of both Houses, which frequently resorted to him; and of late in a question, which had been put in the House of Peers, in the point of the Militia, he had given his Vote both against the King and the Law, to the infinite offence and scandal of all those who adhered to the King.</P>
<P>HE was a man of great reputation in the profession of the Law; for Learning, and all other advantages, which attend the most Eminent <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Men; he was of a very good extraction in <HI>Shrop▪shire,</HI> and inherited a fair Fortune, and Inheritance from his Father; he was a handsome, and a proper Man, of a very graceful Presence, and notorious for Courage, which, in his Youth, he had manifested with his Sword; he had taken great pains in the hardest, and most knotty part of the Law, as well as that which was more customary, and was not only very ready and expert in the Books, but exceedingly versed in Records, in studying and examining whereof, he had kept M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Selden</HI> company, with whom he had great friendship, and who had much assisted him; so that he was looked upon the best Antiquary of the profession, who gave himself up <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to Practice; and, upon the meer strength of his own abilities, he had raised himself into the first rank of the Practicers in the Common Law Courts, and was chosen Recorder of <HI>London</HI> before he was called to the Bench, and grew presently into the highest Practice in all the other Courts, as well as those of the Law. When the King looked more nar∣rowly into his business, and found that he should have much to do in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> he removed an old, useless, illiterate Person, who had been put into that Office by the favour of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and made <HI>Littleton</HI> his Sollicitor General, much to his Honour, but not to his Profit; the obligation of Attendance upon that Office, depriving him <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of much benefit he used to acquire by his Practice, before he had that relation. Upon the death of my Lord <HI>Coventry, Finch</HI> being made Keeper, He was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, Then the best Office of the Law, and that which he was wont to say, in his highest Ambition, in his own private wishes, he had most desired; and it was indeed the Sphere in which he moved most gracefully, and with most advantage, being a master of all that Learning and knowledge, which that Place required, and an excellent Judge, of great Gravity, and above all suspicion of Corruption.</P>
<P>WHILST he held this place, he was by the favour of the Arch-Bishop <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> who had a great esteem of him, recommended to the King to be called to the Council Table, where he kept up his good Name; and, upon the Lord <HI>Finch's</HI> leaving the King∣dom, in the beginning of the Parliament, he was thought, in many re∣spects, to be the fittest to be entrusted in that Office; and, upon the de∣sire of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> after he was in the Tower, was created a Baron, out of expectation that, by his Authority and Knowledge of the Law, he would have been of great use in restraining those extraordinary, and unwarrantable Proceedings; but, from the time he had the Great Seal, he seem'd to be out of his Element, and in some perplexity and ir∣resolution <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in the Chancery it self, tho' he had great experience in the practice, and proceedings of that Court; and made not that dispatch, that was expected, at the Council Table; and in the Parliament he did not preserve any dignity; and appear'd so totally dispirited, that few

men shewed any respect to him, but they who most opposed the King, who indeed did exceedingly apply themselves to him, and were with equal kindness received by him. This wonderful alteration in him, his Friends believed to have proceeded from a great sickness, which had seised upon him quickly after he was created a Baron, insomuch as every Man believed he would die; and by this means, he did not attend the House in some Months; and so perform'd none of those Offices toward the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> the expectation whereof had been the sole Motive to that promotion: From that time he never did appear the same Man; but sure there were Other causes for it, and he was possessed with some <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> melancholy apprehensions, which he could not master, and had no Friend to whom he durst entirely communicate them.</P>
<P>M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde,</HI> one of those who was most trusted by the King in the House of Commons, and had allways had a great respect for the Keeper, was as much troubled at his behaviour, as any man; and using frequently to go to him, went upon that occasion; and with great freedom and plainness, told him, <Q>“”how much he had lost the esteem of all Good men, and that the King could not but be exceedingly dissatisfy'd with him;</Q> and discoursed over the matter of that Vote. Tho' He did not know, that the King did at that time put so great a secret Trust in M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde,</HI> yet <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> he knew very well, that the King had a very good opinion of him, and had heard his Majesty often, from the beginning of the Parliament, when the discourse happen'd to be of the Lawyers of the House, take an occasion from thence to mention M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde,</HI> as a man of whom he heard very well; which the Keeper had many times taken notice of to him: and then he knew the Friendship that was between the Lord <HI>Falk∣land</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde,</HI> and had heard the many Jealousies which were con∣tracted, upon the great communication he had with the two new Coun∣sellors; and so no doubt believed, that he knew much of the King's mind. So that assoon as he had enter'd upon this discourse, which he <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> heard with all attention (they being by themselves in his Study, at <HI>Exe∣ter</HI> House) He rose from his Chair, and went to the Door; and finding some Persons in the next Room, he bad them to withdraw; and locking both the Door of that Room, and of his Study, he sat down himself, and making M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> sit down too, he begun <Q>“”with giving him many thanks for his friendship to him, which, he said, he had ever esteem'd, and he could not more manifest the esteem he had of It and Him, than by using that freedom again with him, which he meant to do. Then he lamented his own condition; and that he had been prefer'd from the Common Pleas, where he knew both the Business and the Persons <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> he had to deal with, to the other high Office he now held, which obliged him to converse and transact with another sort of Men, who were not known to him, and in affairs, which he understood not, and had not one Friend among them, with whom he could confer upon any doubt, which occurred to him.</Q></P>
<P>HE spoke then of the unhappy state and condition of the King's busi∣ness; how much he had been, and was still, betrayed by Persons who were about him; and with all possible indignation against the proceed∣ings of the Parliament; and said, <Q>“”they would never do This, if they were not resolved to do More: that he knew the King too well, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> observed the carriage of particular Men too much, and the whole cur∣rent of publick Transactions these last five or six Months, not to fore∣see that it could not be long, before there would be a War between the
<PB N="445" REF="4630"/>
King and the two Houses; and of the importance, in that Season, that the Great Seal should be with the King.</Q> Then he fell into many ex∣pressions of his Duty, and Affection to the King's Person, as well as to his high Degree▪ <Q>and “”that no Man should be more ready, to perish with, and for his Majesty, than He would be; that the prospect he had of this necessity, had made him carry himself towards that Party with so much complyance, that he might be gracious with them, at least, that they might have no Distrust of him; which, he knew, many had endeavoured to infuse into them; and that there had been a consulta∣tion <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> within few days, whether, in regard he might be sent for by the King, or that the Seal might be taken from him, it would not be best to appoint the Seal to be kept in some such secure place, as that there might be no danger of losing it; and that the Keeper should allways receive it, for the execution of his Office; they having no purpose to disoblige Him. And the knowledge he had of this consultation, and fear he had of the execution of it, had been the reason, why in the late debate upon the Militia, he had given his Vote in such a manner, as, he knew, would make very ill impressions with the King, and ma∣ny others who did not know him very well; but that, if he had not, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in that Point, submitted to their opinion, the Seal had been taken from him that Night; whereas by this complyance in that Vote, which could only prejudice Himself, and not the King, he had gotten so much into their confidence, that he should be able to preserve the Seal in his own hands, till the King required it; and then he would be as ready to attend his Majesty with it.</Q></P>
<P>M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> was very well pleased with this discourse; <Q>and asked him, “”whether he would give him leave, when there should be a fit occasion, to assure the King, that he would perform this Service, when the King should require it? He desired, "that he would do so, and pass his Word <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> for the performance of it, assoon as his Majesty pleased; and so they parted.</Q></P>
<P>IT was within very few days after, that the King, exceedingly dis∣pleased and provoked with the Keepers behaviour, sent an Order to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> "to require the Seal from him; in which the King was very positive, tho' he was not resolved to what hand to commit it. His Majesty wished them (for he allways included the other Two in such references) to consider, <Q>“”whether he should give it to the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Banks</HI> (against whom he made some objection himself) "or into the hands of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Selden;</HI> and to send their opinions to him.</Q> The <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Order was positive for requiring it from the present Officer, but they knew not who to advise for a Successor. The Lord Chief Justice <HI>Banks</HI> appeared to be as much afraid, as the other; and not thought equal to that Charge, in a time of so much disorder; tho' otherwise he was a Man of great abilities, and unblemished integrity; they did not doubt of M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Selden</HI>'s Affection to the King, but withal they knew him so well, that they concluded he would absolutely refuse the place, if it were of∣fer'd to him. He was in years, and of a tender constitution; he had for many years enjoyed his ease, which he loved; was rich; and would not have made a Journey to <HI>York,</HI> or have layn out of his own bed, for <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> any Preferment; which he had never affected.</P>
<P>BEING all Three of one mind, that it would not be fit to offer it to the one or the other; hereupon M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> told them the conference he had with the Keeper, and the professions he had made; and was very
<PB N="$$" REF="4640"/>
confident, that he would very punctually perform it; and therefore pro∣posed, <Q>that “”they might, with their Opinions of the other Persons, like¦wise advise his Majesty to suspend his resolution concerning the Lord Keeper, and rather to write kindly to him, to bring the Seal to his Majesty,</Q> instead of sending for the Seal it self, and cast him off; and offer'd to venture his own credit with the King, that the Keeper would comply with his Majesty's commands. Neither of them were of his opinion; and had both no esteem of the Keeper, nor believed, that he would go to his Majesty, if he were sent for, but that he would find some trick to excuse himself; and therefore were not willing, that M<SUP>r</SUP> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Hyde</HI> should venture his Reputation upon it. <Q>He desired them then “”to consider how absolutely necessary it was, that the King should first resolve into what hand to put the Seal, before he removed it; for that it could not be unimployed one hour, but that the whole Justice of the Kingdom would be out of order, and draw a greater and a juster cla∣mour, than had been yet: That there was as much care to be taken, that it should not be in the power of any man to refuse it; which would be yet more prejudicial to his Majesty. He desired them above all, to weigh well, that the business consisted only in having the Great Seal in the place, where his Majesty resolved to be; and if the Keeper <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> would keep his promise, and desired to serve the King, it would be un∣questionably the best way, that He and the Seal were both there: if, on the other side, he were not an honest Man, and cared not for offend∣ing the King, he would then refuse to deliver it; and inform the Lords of it: who would justify him for his disobedience, and reward and cherish him; and he must then hereafter serve Their turn; the mis∣chief whereof would be greater, than could be easily imagined: and his Majesty's own Great Seal should be every day used against him, nor would it be possible in many Months to procure a New one to be made.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THESE objections appear'd of weight to them; and they resolved to give an account of the whole to the King, and to expect his Order: and both the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde,</HI> writ to his Najesty, and sent their Letters away that very Night. The King was satisfy'd with the Reasons, and was very glad that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde</HI> was so confident of the Keeper; tho', he said, "he remain'd still in doubt; and resolved that he would, such a day of the Week following, send for the Keeper and the Seal; and that it should be, as had been advised, upon a <HI>Saturday</HI> afternoon, assoon as the House of Lords should rise; because then no notice could be taken of it till <HI>Monday.</HI> M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hyde,</HI> who had continued to see the Keeper fre∣quently, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and was confirm'd in his confidence of his integrity, went now to him; and finding him firm to his resolution, and of opinion, in regard of the high proceedings of the Houses, that it should not be long defer'd; he told him, <Q>“”that he might expect a Messenger the next Week, and that he should once more see him, when he would tell him the Day; and that he would then go himself away before him to <HI>York;</HI></Q> with which he was much pleased, and it was agree'd between the Three, that it was now time, that he should be gone (the King having sent for him some time before) after a day or two; in which time the Declaration of the nineteenth of <HI>May</HI> would be passed. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>ON the <HI>Saturday</HI> following, between two and three of the Clock in the Afternoon, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Elliot,</HI> a Groom of the Bed Chamber to the Prince, came to the Keeper, and found him alone in the Room where he used to
<PB N="447" REF="4650"/>
sit, and deliver'd him a Letter from the King in his own hand; wherein he required him, with many expressions of kindness and esteem, <Q>“”to make hast to him; and if his indisposition (for he was often troubled with gravel and sharpness of Urine) would not suffer him to make such hast upon the Journey, as the occasion required, that he should deliver the Seal to the Person, who gave him the Letter; who, being a strong young Man, would make such hast as was necessary; and that he might make his own Journey,</Q> by those degrees which his Health required. The Keeper was surprised with the Messenger, whom he did not like; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and more when he found that he knew the contents of the Letter, which, he hoped, would not have been communicated to any Man, who should be sent: He Answer'd him with much reservation, and when the other with bluntness, as he was no polite Man, demanded the Seal of him, which he had not thought of putting out of his own hands; he Answer'd him, "that he would not deliver it into any hands, but the King's; but presently recollecting himself, and looking over his Letter again, he quickly consider'd, that it would be hazardous to carry the Seal himself such a Journey; and that if by any pursuit of him, which he could not but suspect, he should be seised upon, the King would be very unhap∣pily <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> disappointed of the Seal, which he had reason so much to depend upon; and that his misfortune would be wholely imputed to his own fault and infidelity (which without doubt he abhorred with his heart) and the only way to prevent that mischief, or to appear innocent under it, was to deliver the Seal to the Person trusted by the King himself to receive it; and so, without telling him any thing of his own purpose, he delivered the Seal into his hands; who forthwith put himself on his horse, and with wonderful expedition presented the Great Seal into his Majesty's own hands, who was infinitely pleased with It, and with the Messenger.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> THE Keeper, that Evening, pretended to be indisposed, and that he would take his rest early, and therefore that no body should be ad∣mitted to speak with him: and then he called Serjeant <HI>Lee</HI> to him, who was the Serjeant who waited upon the Seal, and in whom he had great confidence, as he well might; and told him freely, <Q>“”that he was resolved, the next morning, to go to the King, who had sent for him; that he knew well, how much malice he should contract by it from the Parliament, which would use all the means they could to appre∣hend him; and he himself knew not how he should perform the Jour∣ney, therefore he put himself entirely into his hands; that he should <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> cause his Horses to be ready against the next morning, and only his own Groom to attend them, and he to guide the best way, and that he would not impart it to any other Person.</Q> The honest Serjeant was very glad of the resolution, and chearfully undertook all things for the Journey; and so sending the Horses out of the Town, the Keeper put himself in his Coach very early the next morning, and as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon as they were out of the Town, He and the Serjeant, and one Groom, took their Horses, and made so great a journey that day, it being about the be∣ginning of <HI>June,</HI> that before the end of the third day, he kissed the King's hand at <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> HE had purposely procured the House of Peers to be Adjourn'd to a later hour, in the morning for <HI>Monday,</HI> than it used to be. <HI>Sunday</HI> passed without any Man's taking notice of the Keepers being absent; and many, who knew that he was not at his House, thought he had
<PB N="448" REF="4660"/>
been gone to <HI>Cranford,</HI> to his Country House, whither he frequently went on <HI>Saturday</HI> nights, and was early enough at the Parliament on <HI>Monday</HI> mornings; and so the Lords the more willingly consented to the later Adjournments for those days. But on <HI>Monday</HI> morning, when it was known when, and in what manner he had left his House, the con∣fusion in both Houses was very great; and they who had thought that their interest was so great in him, that they knew all his thoughts, and had valued themselves, and were valued by others, upon that account, hung down their heads, and were even distracted with shame: How∣ever they could not but conclude, that he was out of their reach before <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Lords met; yet to shew their indignation against him, and it may be in hope that his infirmities would detain him long in the Journey (as no body indeed thought that he could have perform'd it, with that ex∣pedition) they issued out such a Warrant for the apprehending him, as had been in the case of the foulest Felon or Murtherer; and printed it, and caused it to be dispersed, by Expresses, over all the Kingdom with great hast. All which circumstances both before, and after the Keepers Journey to <HI>York,</HI> are the more particularly, and at large set down, out of justice to the Memory of that noble Person; whose Honour suffer'd then much in the opinion of many, by the confident report of the per∣son, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> who was sent for, and received the Seal, and who was a loud and bold Talker, and desired to have it believed, that his manhood had ra∣vished the Great Seal from the Keeper, even in spight of his teeth; which, how impossible soever in it self, found too much credit; and is therefore cleared by this very true, and punctual Relation, which in truth is but due to him.</P>
<P>BUT the trouble and distraction, which at this time possessed them, was visibly very great; and their dejection such, that the same day the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> (who had been of another temper) moved, <Q>“”that a Committee might be appointed, to consider how there might be <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> an Accommodation between the King and his People, for the Good, Happiness, and Safety of both King and Kingdom;</Q> which Committee was appointed accordingly.</P>
<P>THIS temper of Accommodation troubled them not long, new warmth and vigour being quickly infused into them by the unbroken, and undaunted Spirits of the House of Commons; which, to shew how little they valued the power or Authority of the King, tho▪ supported by having now his Great Seal by him, on the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May</HI> agreed on a new Remonstrance to the People; in which, the Lords concurring, they informed them, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></P>

<PB N="449" REF="4670"/>
and of their own Rights, and Liberties, they may not be carried into the Road way, that leadeth to the utter ruin, and subversion thereof. A late occasion that those wicked Spirits of division had taken to de∣fame, and indeed to arraign the proceedings of both Houses of Parlia∣ment, had been from their Votes of the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April.</HI> And their De∣claration concerning the business of <HI>Hull,</HI> which because they put forth, before they could send their Answer concerning that matter unto his Majesty, those mischievous instrumenrs of dissention, between the King, and the Parliament, and the People, whose chief Labour, and Study, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> was to misrepresent their Actions to his Majesty, and to the Kingdom, would needs interpret this as an Appeal to the People, and a declining of all intercourse between his Majesty, and them; as if they thought it to no purpose, to endeavour any more, to give his Majesty satis∣faction; and, without expecting any longer their Answer, under the Name of a Message from his Majesty to both Houses, they themselves had indeed made an Appeal to the People, as the Message it self did in a manner grant it to be, offering to joyn issue with them in that way, and in the nature thereof did clearly shew it self to be no other; there∣fore They would likewise address their Answer to the Kingdom, not by <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> way of Appeal (as they were charged) but to prevent them from being their own Executioners, and from being perswaded under false colours of defending the Law, and their own Liberties, to destroy both with their own hands, by taking their Lives, Liberties, and Estates, out of Their hands, whom they had chosen, and entrusted therewith, and re∣signing them up unto some evil Counsellors, about his Majesty, who could lay no other foundation of their own greatness, but upon the ruin of this, and, in It, of all Parliaments; and in Them, of the true Religion, and the Freedom of this Nation. And these, they said, were the Men that would perswade the people, that both Houses of Parliament, con∣taining <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> all the Peers, and representing all the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> would destroy the Laws of the Land, and Liberties of the People; wherein, besides the Trust of the whole, they themselves in their own particulars, had so great an Interest of Honour, and Estate, that they hoped it would gain little credit with any, that had the least use of Reason, that such, as must have so great a share in the misery, should take so much pains in the procuring thereof; and spend so much time, and run so many hazards to make themselves Slaves, and to destroy the property of their Estates. But that they might give par∣ticular satisfaction to the several Imputations cast upon them, they <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> would take them in order, as they were laid upon them in that Mes∣sage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FIRST they were charged for the avowing that Act of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham;</HI> which was termed unparallel'd, and an high, and unheard of affront unto his Majesty, and as if they needed not to have done it; he being able, as was alledg'd, to produce no such Command of the Houses of Parliament. They said, altho' S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> had not an Order, that did express every Circumstance of that case, yet he might have produced an Order of both Houses, which did comprehend this case, not only in the clear Intention, but in the very Words thereof; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> which they knowing in their consciences to be so, and to be most ne∣cessary for the safety of the Kingdom, they could not, but in honour and justice, avow that Act His▪ which, they were confident, would appear to all the world to be so far from being an Affront to the King,
<PB N="450" REF="4680"/>
that it would be found to have been an Act of great Loyalty to his Majesty, and to his Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THE next Charge upon them was, that instead of giving his Ma∣jesty satisfaction, they published a Declaration concerning that busi∣ness, as an Appeal to the People, and as if their intercourse with his Majesty, and for his satisfaction, were now to no more purpose; which course was alledg'd to be very unagreeable to the Modesty and Duty of former times, and not warrantable by any Precedents, but what Themselves had made. They said, if the Penner of that Message had expected awhile, or had not expected that two Houses of Parliament <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> ▪especially burthen'd, as they were at that time, with so many pres∣sing and urgent affairs) should have moved as fast as himself, he would not have said, that Declaration was instead of an Answer to his Ma∣jesty; which they did dispatch with all the speed, and diligence they could, and had sent it to his Majesty by a Committee of both Houses; whereby it appeared, that they did it not upon that ground, that they thought it was no more to any purpose, to endeavour to give his Ma∣jesty satisfaction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND as for the Duty and Modesty of former times, from which they were said to have varied, and to want the Warrant of any Prece∣dents <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> therein, but what Themselves had made: If they had made any Precedents this Parliament, they had made them for Posterity, upon the same, or better grounds of Reason and Law, than those were upon, which their Predecessors first made for Them: And as some Precedents ought not to be rules for them to follow, so none could be limits to bound their proceedings: which might, and must vary, according to the different condition of Times. And for that Particular, of setting forth Declarations for the satisfaction of the People, who had chosen, and entrusted them with all that was dearest to them: If there were no example for it, it was because there were never any Monsters be∣fore, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that ever attempted to disaffect the People from a Parliament, or could ever harbour a thought that it might be effected. Were there ever such practices to poyson the People with an ill apprehension of the Parliament? Were there ever such imputations and scandals laid upon the Proceedings of both Houses? Were there ever so many, and so great breaches of Priviledge of Parliament? Were there ever so many, and so desperate designs of force and violence against the Parlia∣ment, and the Members thereof? If they had Done more, than ever their Ancestors had Done, they said, they had Suffered more, than ever They had Suffered; and yet, in point of Modesty and Duty, they <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> would not yield to the best of former times; and they would put that in issue, whether the highest, and most unwarrantable Precedents of any of his Majesty's Predecessors, did not fall short, and much below, what had been done to them this Parliament? And on the other side, whether, if they should make the highest Precedents of other Parlia∣ments their Patterns, there would be cause to complain of want of modesty, and duty in Them; when they had not so much as suffered such things to enter into their Thoughts, which all the world knew They put in Act?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”ANOTHER Charge which was laid very high upon them, and which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> were indeed a very great Crime if they were found guilty thereof, was, that by avowing that Act of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> they did, in consequence, confound and destroy the title, and interest of all his Majesty's good
<PB N="451" REF="4690"/>
Subjects to their Lands and Goods; and that, upon this ground; that his Majesty had the same Title to his Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> which any of his Subjects had to their Houses or Lands, and the same to his Magazine and Munition there, that any Man had to his Money, Plate, or Jewels: And therefore, that they ought not to have been disposed of, without, or against his Consent, no more than the House, Land, Money, Plate, or Jewels of any Subject ought to be, without, or against his Will.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HERE, they said, that was laid down for a Principle, which would indeed pull up the very foundation of the liberty, property, and in∣terest of every Subject in particular, and of all the Subjects in general, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> if they should admit it for a truth, that his Majesty had the same right and title to his Towns, and to his Magazines (bought with the publick Moneys, as they conceived that at <HI>Hull</HI> to have been) that every particular Man hath to his House, Lands, and Goods. For his Ma∣jesty's Towns were no more his own, than his Kingdom was his own; and his Kingdom was no more his own, than his People are his own; and if the King had a property in all his Towns, what would become of the Subjects propriety in their Houses therein? and if He had a pro∣priety in his Kingdom, what would become of the Subjects property in their Lands throughout the Kingdom? or of their Liberties, ifhis <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Majesty had the same right in their Persons, that every Subject hath in his Lands, and Goods? and what would become of all the Subjects interests in the Towns, and Forts of the Kingdom, and in the King∣dom it self, if his Majesty might sell, or give them away, or dispose of them at his pleasure, as a particular Man might do with his Lands, and with his Goods? This erroneous Maxim being infused into Princes, that their Kingdoms are their own, and that they may do with them what they will, as if their Kingdoms were for Them, and not They for their Kingdoms, was, they said, the Root of all the Subjects misery, and of the invading of their just Rights, and Liberties; whereas, in∣deed, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> they are only entrusted with their Kingdoms, and with their Towns, and with their People, and with the publick Treasure of the Common-wealth, and whatsoever is bought therewith; and, by the known Law of this Kingdom, the very Jewels of the Crown are not the King's proper Goods, but are only entrusted to him, for the use and ornament thereof: As the Towns, Forts, Treasure, Magazines, Offices, and the People of the Kingdom, and the whole Kingdom it self is en∣trusted unto him, for the good, and safety, and best advantage thereof: and as this Trust is for the use of the Kingdom, so ought it to be ma∣naged by the advice of the Houses of Parliament, whom the Kingdom <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> hath trusted for that purpose; it being their duty to see it discharged according to the condition and true intent thereof; and as much as in them lies, by all possible means, to prevent the contrary; which, if it had been their chief care, and only aime, in the disposing of the Town and Magazine of <HI>Hull</HI> in such manner as they had done, they hoped it would appear clearly to all the world, that they had discharged their own Trust, and not invaded that of his Majesty, much less his Pro∣perty; which in that case, they could not do.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT admitting his Majesty had indeed a Property in the Town and Magazine of <HI>Hull;</HI> who doubted but that a Parliament may dispose <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of any thing, wherein his Majesty, or any Subject hath a right, in such a way, as that the Kingdom may not be exposed to Hazard, or Danger thereby? Which was Their case, in the disposing of the Town and

Magazine of <HI>Hull.</HI> And whereas his Majesty did allow this, and a greater power to a Parliament, but in that sense only, as he himself was a Part thereof; they appeal'd to every man▪s conscience, that had observed their proceedings, whether they disjoyn'd his Majesty from his Parliament, who had in all humble ways sought his concurrence with them, as in that particular about <HI>Hull,</HI> and for the removal of the Magazine there, so also in all other things; or whether those evil Counsels about him, had not separated him from his Parliament; not only in distance of place, but also in the discharge of the joint Trust with them, for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom in that, and some <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> other Particulars.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY had given no occasion to his Majesty, they said, to declare with so much earnestness his resolution, that he would not suffer ei∣ther, or both Houses by their Votes, without, or against his Consent, to enjoyn any thing that was forbidden by the Law, or to forbid any thing that was enjoyn'd by the Law: for their Votes had done no such thing: And as they should be very tender of the Law (which they did acknowledge to be the safeguard, and custody of all publick and private Interests) so they would never allow a few private Persons about the King, nor his Majesty himself in his own Person, and out of his Courts, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to be judge of the Law, and that contrary to the judgment of the highest Court of Judicature. In like manner, that his Majesty had not refused to consent to any thing, that might be for the Peace and Happiness of the Kingdom, they could not admit it in any other sense, but as his Majesty taketh the measure of what will be for the Peace and Happi∣ness of his Kingdom, from some few ill affected Persons about him, contrary to the Advice, and Judgment of his great Council of Parlia∣ment. And because the Advice of both Houses of Parliament had, through the suggestion of evil Counsellors, been so much undervalued of late, and so absolutely rejected and refused, they said, they held it <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> fit to declare unto the Kingdom, whose Honour and Interest was so much concern'd in it, what was the Priviledge of the Great Council of Parliament herein; and what was the Obligation that lay upon the Kings of this Realm, to pass such Bills, as are offer'd to them by both Houses of Parliament, in the Name, and for the Good of the whole Kingdom, whereunto they stand engaged both in conscience, and justice, to give their Royal Assent: In Conscience, in regard of the Oath, that is, or ought to be taken by the Kings of this Realm at their Corona∣tion, as well to confirm by their Royal Assent such good Laws, as the People shall choose, and to remedy by Law such inconveniences, as <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the Kingdom may suffer; as to keep, and protect the Laws allready in being; as may appear both by the Form of the Oath upon Record, and in Books of good Authority, and by the Statute of the 25 of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> the III. entituled, the Statute of Provisors of Benefices; the Form of which Oath, and the Clause of the Statute that concerneth it, are as followeth:</Q></P>

<Q><L>A Clanse in the preamble of a Statute made the <HI>25 Edw. III.</HI> entituled, the Statute of Provisors of Benefices.</L></Q>
<P>WHEREUPON the said Commons have prayed our said Lord the King; That sith the Right of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and the Law of the said Realm is such, that upon the mischiefs and damages, which happen to <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> this Realm, he ought, and is bound by his Oath, with the accord of his People in his Parliament, thereof to make Remedy and Law, and in re∣moving the mischiefs, and damages which thereof en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue, that it may please him thereupon to ordain Remedy.</P>
<P>OUR Lord the King seeing the mischiefs and damages before men∣tion'd, and having regard to the Statute made in the time of his said Grandfather, and to the Causes contained in the same, which Statute holdeth allways his force, and was never defeated, repealed, or annulled in any point, and by so much he is bound by his Oath to cause the same to be kept as the Law of his Realm, tho' that, by sufferance and negli∣gence, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> it hath been sithence attempted to the contrary: Also having re∣gard to the grievous complaints made to him by his People, in divers his Parliaments holden heretofore, willing to ordain remedy for the great damages, and mischiefs which have happen'd, and daily do happen, to the Church of <HI>England</HI> by the said Cause:</P>
<P><Q>“”HERE, they said, the Lords, and Commons claim it directly as the Right of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and of the Law of the Land, and that the King is bound by his Oath, with the accord of his People in Par∣liament, to make remedy, and Law, upon the mischiefs and damages, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> which happen to this Realm; and the King doth not deny it, altho' he take occasion from a Statute formerly made by his Grandfather, which was laid as part of the grounds of this Petition, to fix his An∣swer upon another branch of his Oath, and pretermits that which is claimed by the Lords and Commons; which he would not have done, if it might have been excepted against.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”IN Justice, they said, they are obliged thereunto, in respect of the Trust reposed in them; which is as well to preserve the Kingdom by the making new Laws, where there shall be need, as by observing of Laws allready made; a Kingdom being, many times, as much exposed <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to ruin, for the want of a new Law, as by the violation of those that are in being: and this is so clear a Right, that, no doubt, his Majesty would acknowledge it to be as due to his People, as his Protection. But how far forth he was obliged to follow the judgment of his Parlia∣ment
<PB N="454" REF="4720"/>
therein, that is the Question. And certainly, besides the words in the King's Oath, referring unto such Laws as the People shall choose, as in such things which concern the publick Weal and Good of the Kingdom, They are the most proper judges, who are sent from the whole Kingdom for that very purpose; so they did not find, that since Laws have passed by way of Bills (which are read thrice in both Houses, and Committed; and every part, and circumstance of them fully weighed, and debated upon the Commitment, and afterwards passed in both Houses) that ever the Kings of this Realm did deny them, otherwise than is expressed in that usual Answer, <HI>Le Roy S▪avisera;</HI> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> which signifies rather a suspension, than a refusal of the Royal Assent. And in those other Laws, which are framed by way of Petitions of Right, the Houses of Parliament have taken themselves to be so far Judges of the Right claimed by them, that when the King's Answer hath not, in every point, been fully according to their desires▪ they have still insisted upon their claim, and never rested satisfy'd, till such time as they had an Answer according to their demand; as had been done in the late Petition of Right, and in former times upon the like occasion. And if the Parliament be judge between the King and his People in the question of Right (as by the manner in the claime in <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Petitions of Right, and by judgments in Parliament, in cases of illegal impositions and taxes, and the like, it appears to be) why should they not be so also, in the question of the Common Good, and Necessity of the Kingdom; wherein the Kingdom hath as clear a Right also to have the benefit, and remedy of Law, as in any thing whatsoever? And yet they did not deny, but that in private Bills, and also in publick Acts of Grace, as Pardons, and the like Grants of Favour, his Majesty might have a greater latitude of Granting, or Denying, as he should think fit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”All this consider'd, they said, they could not but wonder, that the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Contriver of that Message should conceive, the People of this Land to be so void of Common sense, as to enter into so deep a mistrust of those, whom they have, and his Majesty ought to repose so great a Trust in, as to despair of any security in their private Estates, by Descents, Pur∣chases, Assurances, or Conveyances; unless his Majesty should, by His Vote, prevent the prejudice, they might receive therein by the Votes of both Houses of Parliament; as if They, who are especially chosen, and entrusted for that purpose, and who Themselves must needs have so great a share in all Grievances of the Subject, had wholely cast off all care of the Subjects Good, and his Majesty had solely taken it up; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and as if it could be imagined, that They should, by their Votes, over∣throw the Rights of Descents, Purchases, or of any Conveyance or Assurance, in whose judgment the whole Kingdom hath placed all their particular interests, if any of them should be called in question, in any of those cases; and that (as not knowing where to place them, with greater security) without any Appeal from Them to any other Person, or Court whatsoever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT indeed they were very much to seek, how the Case of <HI>Hull</HI> could concern Descents and Purchases, or Conveyances and Assurances; unless it were in procuring more security to Men in their Private in∣terests, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> by the preservation of the Whole from confusion, and de∣struction; and much less did they understand, how the Soveraign Power was resisted, and despised therein. Certainly no command from his
<PB N="455" REF="4730"/>
Majesty, and his high Court of Parliament (where the Soveraign Power resides) was disobeyed by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham;</HI> nor yet was his Majesty's Authority derived out of any other Court, nor by any legal Commis∣sion, or by any other way, wherein the Law had appointed his Ma∣jesty's commands to be derived to be derived to his Subjects; and of what validity his Verbal Commands are, without any such Stamp of his Authority upon them, and against the Order of both Houses of Parliament, and whether the not submitting thereunto, be a resisting and despising of the Soveraign Authority, they would leave to all Men to judge, that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> do at all understand the Government of this Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY acknowledged that his Majesty had made many expressions of his Zeal, and Intentions against the desperate designs of the Papists; but yet it was also as true, that the Counsels, which had prevailed of late with him, had been little suitable to those Expressions, and In∣tentions. For what did more advance the open, and bloo ly design of the Papists in <HI>Ireland</HI> (whereon the secret Plots of the Papists here did, in all likelyhood, depend) than his Majesty's absenting himself, in that manner that he did, from his Parliament; and setting forth such sharp Invectives against them, notwithstanding all the humble Peti∣tions, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and other means, which his Parliament had addressed unto him, for his return, and for his satisfaction concerning their proceedings? And what was more likely to give a rise to the designs of the Papists (whereof there so many in the North, near to the Town of <HI>Hull)</HI> and of other malignant, and ill affected Persons (which were ready to joyn with them) or to the attempts of Forreigners from abroad, than the continuing of that great Magazine at <HI>Hull,</HI> at this time, and con∣trary to the desire and advice of both Houses of Parliament? So that they had too much cause to believe, that the Papists had still some way and means, whereby they had influence upon his Majesty's Counsels <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> for their own advantage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Malignant Party, they said, his Majesty needed not a de∣sinition of the Law, nor yet a more full Character of them from both Houses of Parliament, for to find them out, if he would please only to apply the Character, that Himself had made of them, to those, unto whom it doth properly and truly belong. Who are so much disaf∣fected to the Peace of the Kingdom, as they that endeavour to disaffect his Majesty from the Houses of Parliament, and perswade him to be at such a distance from them, both in place and affection? Who are more disaffected to the Government of the Kingdom, than such as lead <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty away from hearkning to his Parliament; which, by the con∣stitution of the Kingdom, is his greatest and best Council; and perswade him to follow the malicious Counsels of some private Men, in opposing and contradicting the wholesome advices, and just proceedings of that his most faithful Council, and highest Court? Who are they, that not only neglect and despise, but labour to undermine the Law under co∣lour of maintaining it, but they that endeavour to destroy the Foun∣tain, and Conservatory of the Law, which is the Parliament? And Who are they that set up other Rules for themselves to walk by, than such as were according to Law, but they that will make other Judges <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of the Law than the Law hath appointed; and so dispence with their obedience to that, which the Law calleth Authority, and to Their de∣terminations and resolutions, to whom the judgment doth appertain by Law? For, when private Persons shall make the Law to be their
<PB N="456" REF="4740"/>
Rule according to their own understanding, contrary to the judgment of those, that are the competent judges thereof, they set up unto them∣selves other Rules than the Law doth acknowledge. Who those Per∣sons were, none knew better than his Majesty himself: And if he would please to take all possible caution of them, as destructive to the Com∣mon-wealth and Himself, and would remove them from about him, it would be the most effectual means to compose all the distractions, and to cure the distempers of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>'s Letter, they said, they did not make mention of it as a ground to hinder his Majesty from visiting his own Fort; but <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> they appeal'd to the judgment of any indifferent Man, that should read that Letter, and compare it with the posture that his Majesty then did, and still doth, stand in towards the Parliament, and with the circum∣stances of that late Action of his Majesty's going to <HI>Hull,</HI> whether the advisers of that Journey intended only a Visit of that Fort, and Ma∣gazine?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AS to the ways and overtures of Accommodation, and the Message of the twentieth of <HI>January</HI> last, so often pressed, but still in vain, as was alledged: Their Answer was, That altho' so often as that Message of the twentieth of <HI>January</HI> had been pressed, so often had their Privi∣ledges <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> been clearly infringed, that a way and method of proceedings should be prescribed to them, as well for the settling of his Majesty's Revenue, as for the presenting of their own Desires (a thing which in former Parliaments had allways been excepted against, as a breach of Priviledge) yet, in respect to the matter contain'd in that Message, and out of their earnest desire to beget a good understanding between his Majesty and them, they swallowed down all matters of Circumstance; and had e▪re that time presented the chief of their desires to his Ma∣jesty, had they not been interrupted with continual Denials even of those things that were necessary for their present security, and sub∣sistence; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and had not those Denials been follow'd with perpetual In∣vectives against Them, and their Proceedings; and had not those In∣vectives been heaped upon them so thick one after another (who were in a manner allready taken up wholely with the pressing Affairs of this Kingdom, and of the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland)</HI> that as they had little en∣couragement from thence, to hope for any good Answers to their De∣sires, so they had not so much time left them to perfect them in such a manner, as to offer them to his Majesty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY confessed it to be a resolution most worthy of a Prince, and of his Majesty, to shut his ears against any, that would incline him to <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> a Civil War; and to abhor the very apprehension of it. But they could not believe that mind to have been in Them, that came with his Ma∣jesty to the House of Commons; or in Them that accompanied his Majesty to <HI>Hampton</HI>-Court, and appeared in a Warlike manner at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames;</HI> or in divers of Them who follow'd his Ma∣jesty lately to <HI>Hull;</HI> or in Them, who after drew their Swords in <HI>York,</HI> demanding, <HI>who would be for the King?</HI> nor in Them that advised his Majesty to declare S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> a Traytor, before the Message was sent concerning that business to the Parliament, or to make propositions to the Gentlemen of the County of <HI>York</HI> to assist his Majesty to pro∣ceed <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> against him in a way of Force, before he had, or possibly could re∣ceive an Answer from the Parliament, to whom he had sent to demand Justice of them against S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> for that Fact: and if those
<PB N="457" REF="4750"/>
Malignant Spirits should ever force them to defend their Religion, the Kingdom, the Priviledges of Parliament, and the Rights▪ and Liber∣ties of the Subjects, with their Swords; the Blood, and Destruction that should ensue there upon, must be wholely cast upon Their Account; God, and their own Consciences told them, that They were clear; and they doubted not, but God, and the whole World would clear them therein.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR Captain <HI>Leg,</HI> they had not said that he was accused, or that there was any Charge against him, for the bringing up of the Army; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> but that he was employed in that Business. And for that concerning the Earl of <HI>New Castle,</HI> mention'd by his Majesty, which was said to have been asked long since, and that it was not easy to be Answer'd: They conceived it was a Question of more difficulty, and harder to be Answer'd, why, when his Majesty held it necessary, upon the same grounds that first moved from the Houses of Parliament, that a Gover∣nour should be placed in that Town, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> a Gentleman of known Fortune and Integrity, and a Person of whom both Houses of Parliament had expressed their confidence, should be refused by his Majesty; and the Earl of <HI>New-Castle</HI> (who, by the way, was so far <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> named in the business of bringing up the Army, that altho' there was not ground enough for a Judicial Proceeding, yet there was ground of Suspicion; at least his Reputation was not left so unblemished there∣by, as that he should be thought the fittest Man in <HI>England</HI> for that Employment of <HI>Hull)</HI> should be sent down, in a private way, from his Majesty to take upon him that Government? And why he should dis∣guise himself under another name, when he came thither, as he did? But whosoever should consider, together with those circumstances, that of the Time when S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> was appointed, by both Houses of Parliament, to take upon him that Employment, which was pre∣sently <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> after his Majesty's coming to the House of Commons, and upon the retiring himself to <HI>Hampton</HI>-Court, and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>'s assembling of Cavaliers at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> would find reason enough, why that Town of <HI>Hull</HI> should be committed rather to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> by the Authority of both Houses of Parliament, than to the Earl of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> sent from his Majesty in that manner that he was. And for the Power, that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> had from the two Houses of Par∣liament, the better it was known and understood, they were confident the more it would be approved and justified: And as they did not con∣ceive, that his Majesty's refusal to have that Magazine removed, could <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> give any advantage against him to have it taken from him; and as no such thing was done, so they could not conceive, for what other Rea∣son any should counsel his Majesty, not to suffer it to be removed, upon the desire of both Houses of Parliament; except it were, that they had an intention to make use of it against Them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they did not except against those that presented a Pe∣tition to his Majesty at <HI>York,</HI> for the continuance of the Magazine at <HI>Hull,</HI> in respect of their Condition, or in respect of their Number; because they were Mean persons, or because they were Few; but be∣cause they being but a few, and there being so many more in the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> County of as good quality as themselves (who had, by their Petition to his Majesty, disavow'd that Act of theirs) that they should take upon them the Style of all the Gentry, and Inhabitants of that County; and, under that Title, should presume to interpose their Advice con∣trary
<PB N="458" REF="4760"/>
to the Votes of both Houses of Parliament: And, if it could be made to appear, that any of those Petitions, that are said to have been presented to the Houses of Parliament, and to have been of a strange nature, were of such a nature as that, They were confident, that they were never received with their Consent, and Approbation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WHETHER there was an Intention to deprive S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> of his Life, if his Majesty had been admitted into <HI>Hull;</HI> and whether the Information were such, as that he had ground to believe it, they would not bring into question; for That was not, nor ought to have been, the ground for doing what he did: Neither was the Number of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty's Attendants, for being more or fewer, much considerable in this case; for altho' it were true, that if his Majesty had entred with twenty Horse only, he might happily have found means for to have forced the entrance of the rest of his Train; who, being once in the Town, would not have been long without Armes; yet That was not the Ground, upon which S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> was to proceed; but upon the Admittance of the King into the Town at all, so as to deliver up the Town and Magazine unto him, and to whomsoever he should give the Command thereof, without the Knowledge and Consent of both Houses of Parliament, by whom he was entrusted to the con∣trary: <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and his Majesty having declared, that to be his intention con∣cerning the Town, in a Message that he sent to the Parliament, not long before he went to <HI>Hull;</HI> saying, that he did not doubt, but that Town should be deliver'd up to him, whensoever he pleased, as sup∣posing it to be kept against him; and in like manner concerning his Magazine, in his Message of the 24<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>April,</HI> wherein it is expressed, that his Majesty went thither, with a purpose to take into his hands the Magazine, and to dispose of it in such manner, as he should think fit: Upon those terms, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> could not have admitted his Majesty, and have made good his Trust to the Parliament, tho' his Ma∣jesty <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> would have enter'd alone, without any Attendants at all of his own, or of the Prince or Duke, his Sons; which they did not wish to be less, than they were, in their Number, but could heartily wish that they were generally better in their Condition.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”IN the close of that Message, his Majesty stated the Case of <HI>Hull;</HI> and thereupon inferred, that the Act of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> was levying War against the King; and, consequently, that it was no less than High-Treason, by the letter of the Statute of the 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. <HI>ch.</HI> 2. unless the Sense of that Statute were very far differing from the Letter thereof. <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”IN the stating of that Case, they said, divers Particulars might be observed, wherein it was not rightly stated: As,</Q></P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>“”THAT his Majesty's going to <HI>Hull,</HI> was only an endeavour to Visit a Town, and Fort of his: whereas it was indeed to Possess him∣self of the Town, and Magazine there, and to dispose of them, as he himself should think good, without, and contrary to the Advice, and Orders of both Houses of Parliament; as did clearly appear by his Majesty's own Declaration of his Intentions therein, by his Messages to both Houses, immediately before, and after that Journey. Nor could they believe, that any Man, who should consider the circumstances of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that Journey to <HI>Hull,</HI> could think, that his Majesty would have gone thither at that time, and in that posture, that he was pleased to put himself in towards the Parliament, if he had intended only a Visit of the Town and Magazine.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="459" REF="4770"/>
2. IT was said to be his Majesty's own Town, and his own Magazine, <Q>“”which being understood in that sense, as was before expressed, as if his Majesty had a private Interest of Propriety therein, they could not admit it to be so.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>“”WHICH was the main Point of all, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> was said to have shut the Gates against his Majesty, and to have made resistance with Armed Men, in defiance of his Majesty; whereas it was indeed in obedience to his Majesty, and his Authority, and for His Service, and the Service of the Kingdom; for which use only, all that Interest <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> is, that the King hath in the Town; and it is no further his to dispose of, than he useth it for that end: and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> being com∣manded to keep the Town and Magazine, for his Majesty and the King∣dom, and not to deliver them up, but by his Majesty's Authority signi∣fied by both Houses of Parliament, all that was to be understood by those expressions, of his denying, and opposing his Majesty's entrance, and telling him in plain terms, that he should not come in, was only this, that he humbly desired his Majesty to forbear his entrance, till he might acquaint the Parliament; and that his Authority might come signified to him by both Houses of Parliament, according to the Trust <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> reposed in him. And certainly, if the Letter of the Statute of the 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> III. <HI>ch.</HI> 2. be thought to import this, That no War can be le∣vied against the King, but what is directed, and intended against his Person, or that every levying of Forces for the defence of the King's Authority, and of his Kingdom, against the Personal Commands of the King opposed thereunto, tho' accompanied with his Presence, is levying War against the King, it is very far from the Sense of that Sta∣tute; and so much the Statute it self speaks (besides the Authority of Book Cases; Precedents of divers Traytors condemn'd upon that inter∣pretation thereof) For if the Clause of levying of War had been meant <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> only against the King's Person, what need had there been thereof after the other branch of Treason, in the same Statute, of compassing the King's Death, which would necessarily have implied this? And because the former Clause doth imply this, it seems not at all to be intended in this latter branch; but only the levying of War against the King, that is, against his Laws and Authority: And the levying of War against his Laws and Authority, tho' not against his Person, is levying War against the King; but the levying of Force against his Personal Com∣mands, tho' accompanied with his Presence, and not against his Laws and Authority, but in the maintenance thereof, is no levying of War <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> against the King, but for him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HERE was then, they said, their Case: In a time of so many suc∣cessive Plots, and Designs of Force against the Parliament, and the Kingdom; in a time of probable Invasion from abroad, and that to begin at <HI>Hull,</HI> and to take the opportunity of seising upon so great a Magazine there; in a time of so great distance and alienation of his Majesty's Affection from his Parliament (and in Them from his King∣dom, which they represent) by the wicked suggestions of a few Ma∣lignant Persons, by whose mischievous Counsels he was wholely led away from his Parliament, and their faithful Advices and Counsels: <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in such a time, the Lords and Commons in Parliament command S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> to draw in some of the Train'd-bands of the parts ad∣jacent to the Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> for the securing that Town and Magazine for the Service of his Majesty, and of the Kingdom: of the safety

whereof there is a higher Trust reposed in Them, than any where else; and They are the proper Judges of the danger thereof.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THIS Town and Magazine being entrusted to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> with express Order not to deliver them up, but by the King's Authority signified by both Houses of Parliament; his Majesty, contrary to the Advice and Directions of both Houses of Parliament, without the Au∣thority of any Court, or any Legal way, wherein the Law appoints the King to speak and command, accompanied with the same evil Counsel about him that he had before, by a Verbal command requires S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> to admit him into the Town, that he might dispose <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of It, and of the Magazine there, according to his own, or rather ac∣cording to the pleasure of those evil Counsellors, who are still in so much credit about him; in like manner as the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> had con∣tinual recourse unto, and countenance from, the Queen s Majesty in <HI>Holland;</HI> by which means he had opportunity still to communicate his Trayterous conceptions, and suggestions to both their Majesties; such as those were concerning his Majesty's retiring to a Place of Strength, and Declaring himself, and his own advancing his Majesty's Service in such a way beyond the Seas, and after that resorting to his Ma∣jesty in such a place of Strength; and divers other things of that nature, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> contained in his Letter to the Queen's Majesty, and to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Lewis Dives;</HI> a Person, that had not the least part in this late business of <HI>Hull,</HI> and was presently dispatched away into <HI>Holland,</HI> soon after his Majesties return from <HI>Hull;</HI> for what Purpose, they left the world to judge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”UPON the refusal of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> to admit his Majesty into <HI>Hull,</HI> presently, without any due process of Law, before his Majesty had sent up the narration of his Fact to the Parliament, he was proclaim'd Traytor; and yet it was said, that therein was no violation of the Sub∣jects Rights, nor any breach of the Law, nor of the Priviledge of Par∣liament, tho' S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> be a Member of the House of Com∣mons; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and that his Majesty must have better reason, than bare Votes, to believe the contrary; altho' the Votes of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, being the Great Council of the Kingdom, are the rea∣son of the King, and of the Kingdom: yet these Votes, they said, did not want clear, and apparent reason for them; for if the solemn pro∣claiming him a Travtor signify any thing, it puts a Man, and all those that any way aid, assist, or adhere unto him, in the same condition of Traytors; and draws upon him all the consequences of Treason: And if that might be done by Law, without due process of Law, the Sub∣ject hath a very poor defence of the Law; and a very small, if any pro∣portion <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of Liberty thereby. And it is as little satisfaction to a Man, that shall be exposed to such Penalties, by that Declaration of him to be Traytor, to say, he shall have a Legal Tryal afterwards, as it is to condemn a Man first, and try him afterwards. And if there could be a necessity for any such proclaiming a Man a Traytor without due process of Law, yet there was none in this case; for his Majesty might as well have expected the judgement of Parliament (which was the right way) as he had leisure to send to them to demand justice against S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham.</HI> And the breach of Priviledge of Parliament was as clear in this Case, as the subversion of the Subjects Common right: <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> For, tho' the Priviledges of Parliament, do not extend to those Cases, mention'd in the Declaration, of Treason, Felony, and Breach of Peace, so as to exempt the Members of Parliament from punishment, nor
<PB N="461" REF="4790"/>
from all manner of Process and Tryal, as it doth in other Cases; yet it doth Priviledge them in the Way, and Method of their Tryal and Punishment; and that the Parliament should have the Cause first brought before them, that they may judge of the Fact, and of the grounds of the Accusation, and how far forth the manner of their Tryal may con∣cern, or not concern the Priviledge of Parliament. Otherwise it would be in the power, not only of his Majesty, but of every Private man, under pretensions of Treasons, or those other Crimes, to take any Man from his Service in Parliament; and so as many one after another as <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> he pleaseth; and, consequently, to make a Parliament what he will, when he will; which would be a breach of so Essential a Priviledge of Parliament, as that the very Being thereof depends upon it. And therefore they no ways doubted but every One, that had taken the Pro∣testation, would, according to his Solemn Vow, and Oath, defend it with his Life, and Fortune, Neither did the sitting of a Parliament suspend all, or any Law, in maintaining that Law which upholds the Priviledge of Parliament; which upholds the Parliament; which up∣holds the Kingdom. And they were so far from believing, that his Majesty was the only Person against whom Treason could Not be com∣mitted, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that, in some sense, they acknowledged he was the only Per∣son against whom it Could be committed; that is, as he is King: and that Treason, which is against the Kingdom, is more against the King, than that which is against his Person; because he is King: For that very Treason is not Treason, as it is against him as a Man, but as a man that is a King; and as he hath relation to the Kingdom, and stands as a Person entrusted with the Kingdom, and discharging that Trust.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”NOW, they said, the Case was truly stated, and all the world might judge where the Fault was; altho' they must avow, that there could <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> be no competent Judge of this, or any the like Case, but a Parliament. And they were as confident, that his Majesty should never have cause to resort to any other Court, or Course, for the vindication of his just Priviledges, and for the recovery and maintenance of his known, and undoubted Rights, if there should be any Invasion, or Violation there∣of, than to his high Court of Parliament: And, in case those wicked Counsellors about him, should drive him into any other Course from, and against his Parliament, whatever his Majesty's expressions, and intentions were, they should appeal to all men's Consciences; and de∣sire, that they would lay their hands upon their hearts, and think with <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> themselves, whether such Persons, as had of late, and still did resort unto his Majesty, and had his ear, and favour most, either had been, or were more Zealous Assertors of the true Protestant Profession (altho' they believed they were more earnest in the Protestant Profession, than in the Protestant Religion) or the Law of the Land, the Liberty of the Subject, and the Priviledges of the Parliament, than the Members of both Houses of Parliament; who were insinuated to be the De∣serters, if not the Destroyers of them: And whether if they could master this Parliament by force, they would not hold up the same power to deprive us of all Parliaments; which are the Ground, and Pillar of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> the Subjects Liberty, and that which only maketh <HI>England</HI> a free Mo∣narchy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Order of Assistance to the Committee of both Houses; as they had no Directions or Instructions, but what had the Laws for
<PB N="462" REF="4800"/>
their Limits, and the Safety of the Land for their Ends, so they doubted not but all persons mention'd in that Order, and all his Majesty's good Subjects, would yield obedience to his Majesty's Authority, signified therein by both Houses of Parliament. And that all Men might the better know their duty in matters of that nature, and upon how sure a ground They go, that follow the judgment of Parliament for their Guide, they wished them judiciously to consider the true meaning, and ground of that Statute made in the eleventh Year of King <HI>H.</HI> VII. <HI>ch.</HI> I. which was printed at large in the end of his Majesty's Message of the fourth of <HI>May:</HI> That Statute provides, that none who shall attend <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> upon the King and do him true Service, should be attainted, or for∣feit any thing. What was the Scope of that Statute? To provide that Men should not suffer as Traytors, for serving the King in his Wars according to the duty of their Allegiance? If this had been all, it had been a very needless, and ridiculous Statute. Was it then intended (as They seem'd to take the meaning of it to be, that caused it to be printed after his Majesty's Message) that They should be free from all Crime and Penalty, that should follow the King, and serve him in War in any case whatsoever; whether it were for, or against the King∣dom, and the Laws thereof? That could not be; for that could not <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> stand with the duty of their Allegiance; which, in the beginning of the Statute, was expressed to be to serve the King for the time being in his Wars, for the defence of Him, and the Land; and therefore if it be against the Land (as it cannot be understood to be otherwise, if it be against the Parliament, the Representative body of the Kingdom) it is a declining from the duty of Allegiance; which this Statute sup∣poseth may be done, tho' Men should follow the King's Person in the War: Otherwise there had been no need of such a Proviso in the end of the Statute, that none should take the benefit thereby, that should decline from their Allegiance. That therefore which is the principal <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Verb in this Statute is, The serving of the King for the time being; which could not be meant of <HI>Perkin Warbeck,</HI> or any that should call himself King; but such a One, as whatever his Titlemight prove, ei∣ther in Himself, or in his Ancestors, should be received, and acknow∣ledged for such by the Kingdom; the Consent whereof cannot be dis∣cern'd but by Parliament; the Act whereof is the Act of the whole Kingdom, by the Personal Suffrage of the Peers, and the delegate Con∣sent of all the Commons of <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. a wise King, considering that what was the case of <HI>Rich.</HI> III his Predecessor, might, by chance of battle, be his own; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and that he might at once, by such a Statute as this, satisfy such, as had served his Predecessor in his Wars, and also secure those, which should serve Him, who might otherwise fear to serve him in the Wars; lest, by chance of Battle, Thatmight happen to him also (if a Duke of <HI>York</HI> had set up a Title against him) which had happen'd to his Predecessor, he procured this Statute to be made, That no Man should be accounted a Traytor for serving the King, in his Wars, for the time being, that is, which was for the present allowed, and received by the Parliament in behalf of the Kingdom: And, as it is truely suggested, in the pream∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le of the Statute, it is not agreeable to Reason or Conscience, that it <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> should be otherwise; seeing Men should be put upon an Impossibility of knowing their Duty, if the judgment of the highest Court should not be a Rule, and Guide to them. And if the judgment thereof should
<PB N="463" REF="4810"/>
be followed, where the Question is, who is King? much more, what is the best Service of the King, and Kingdom? And therefore those, who should guide themselves by the judgment of Parliament ought, whatever happen, to be secure and free from all Account and Penal∣ties, upon the Grounds and Equity of this very Statute.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY said, they would conclude, that altho' those wicked Coun∣sellors about his Majesty, had presumed, under his Majesty's Name, to put that dishonour, and affront upon both Houses of Parliament; and to make Them the countenancers of Treason, enough to have dissolved <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> all the bands, and sinews of confidence between his Majesty, and his Parliament (of whom the Maxim of the Law is, that a dishonourable thing ought not to be imagined of them) yet they doubted not, but it should, in the end, appear to all the world, that their endeavours had been most hearty and sincere, for the maintenance of the true Pro∣testant Religion; the King's just Prerogative; the Laws, and Liber∣ties of the Land; and the Priviledges of Parliament: in which endea∣vours, by the Grace of God, they would still persist, tho' they should perish in the work; which if it should be, it was much to be fear'd, that Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Parliaments, would not be long <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> lived after them.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Declaration wrought more upon the minds of Men, than all they had done? for the business at <HI>Hull</HI> was, by very many, thought to be done before projected; and the Argument of the Militia to be en∣ter'd upon at first in passion, and afterwards pursued with that vehe∣mence, insensibly, by being engaged; and that both extravagances had so much weighed down the King's Trespasses, in coming to the House and accusing the Members, that a reasonable agreement would have been the sooner consented to on all hands. But when, by this Declaration, they saw Foundations laid, upon which not only what had been all∣ready <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> done, would be well justified, but whatsoever they should, here∣after, find convenient to second what was allready done; and that not only the King, but the Regal Power was either suppressed, or deposited in other hands; the irregularity, and monstrousness of which Principles found little opposition or resistance, even for the Irregularity, and Mon∣strousness: Very many thought it as unsafe to be present at those Con∣sultations, as to consent to the Conclusions; and so great Numbers of the Members of both Houses, absenting themselves; and many especially of the House of Peers, resorted to his Majesty at <HI>York.</HI> So that, in the De∣bates of the highest consequence, there was not usually present, in the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> House of Commons, the fifth part of their just Numbers; and, very often, not above a Dozen or Thirteen, in the House of Peers. In the mean time the King had a full Court, and received all Comers with great clemency, and grace; calling allways all the Peers to Counsel, and communicating with them all such Declarations, as he thought fit to publish in Answer to those of the Parliament; and all Messages, and whatever else was necessary to be done for the improvement of his con∣dition: And, having now the Great Seal with him, issued such Procla∣mations, as were seasonable for the preservation of the Peace of the King∣dom. First he published a Declaration in Answer to that of the nineteenth <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of <HI>May,</HI> in which his Majesty said,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty's Answer to the Declarationof the <HI>19</HI> of <HI>May.</HI></NOTE> <Q>“”THAT if he could be weary of taking any pains for the satisfaction of his People, and to undeceive them of those specious, mischievous infusions, which were dayly instilled into them to shake, and corrupt
<PB N="464" REF="4820"/>
their Loyalty, and Affection to his Majesty and his Government, after so full, and ample Declaration of himself and Intentions, and so fair and satisfactory Answers to all such matters as had been objected to him, by a Major part present of both Houses of Parliament, He might well give over that labour of his Pen; and sit still, till it should please God to enlighten the affections, and understandings of his good Sub∣jects on his behalf which he doubted not, but that, in His good Time he would do) that they might see His sufferings were Their sufferings: but since, instead of applying themselves to the method, proposed by his Majesty, of making such solid particular Propositions, as might <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> establish a good understanding between them, or of following the ad∣vice of his Council of <HI>Scotland</HI> (with whom they communicated their affairs) in forbearing all means that might make the breach wider, and the wound deeper; they had chosen to pursue his Majesty with new Reproaches, or rather to continue and improve the old, by adding, and varying little Circumstances and Language, in matters formerly urged by them, and fully Answer'd by his Majesty, He had prevailed with himself, upon very mature and particular consideration of it, to An∣swer the late printed Book entituled a Declaration, or Remonstrance of the Lords and Commons, which was order'd, the nineteenth of <HI>May</HI> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> last, to be printed and published; hoping then, that they would put his Majesty to no more of that trouble, but that That should have been the last of such a Nature, they would have communicated to his Peo∣ple; and that they would not, as they had done since, have thought fit to assault him with a newer Declaration, indeed of a very New na∣ture, and Learning; which should have another Answer: and he doubted not, but that his good Subjects would, in short time, be so well instructed in the differences, and mistakings between them, that they would plainly discern, without resigning their reason and understanding to His Prerogative, or the Infallibility of a now Major part of both <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Houses of Parliament (infected by a few Malignant Spirits) where the Fault was.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, tho' he should, with all humility and alacrity, be allways forward to acknowledge the infinite Mercy, and Providence of Allmighty God, vouchfafed, so many several ways, to Himself and this Nation; yet since God himself doth not allow, that we should fancy, and create dangers to our selves, that we might manifest, and publish his Mercy in our Deliverance; He must profess, that he did not know those Deliverances, mention'd in the beginning of that Declaration, from so many wicked Plots and Designs, since the beginning of this <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Parliament; which, if they had taken effect, would have brought ruin and destruction upon this Kingdom. His Majesty well knew the great labour and skill, which had been used to amuse, and affright his good Subjects with fears, and apprehensions of Plots and Conspiracies; the several Pamphlets published, and Letters scatter'd up and down, full of such ridiculous, contemptible animadversions to that purpose, as (tho' they found, for what end God knows, very unusual countenance) no Sober man would be moved with them. But, he must confess, he had never been able to inform himself of any such pernicious, form'd design against the Peace of the Kingdom, since the beginning of this <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Parliament, as was mention'd in that Declaration; or which might be any Warrant to those great Fears, both Houses of Parliament seem'd to be transported with; but he had great reason to believe, the more
<PB N="465" REF="4830"/>
mischief and danger had been raised and begotten, to the disturbance of the Kingdom, than cured and prevented, by those Fears, and Jea∣lousies. And therefore, however the rumour, and discourse of Plots and Conspiracies, might have been necessary to the designs of particu∣lar Men, they should do well not to pay any false Devotions to All∣mighty God, who discerns whether our dangers are real, or pretended.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the bringing up of the Army to <HI>London,</HI> as his Majesty had heretofore, by no other direction than the testimony of a good Con∣science, called God to Witness that he never had, or knew of any such <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Resolution; so he said, upon the view of the Depositions now published with that Declaration, it was not evident to his Majesty, that there was ever such a Design; unless every loose Discourse, or Argument, be evidence enough of a Design: And it was apparent, that what had been said of it, was near three Months before the Discovery to both Houses of Parliament; so that if there were any danger threatn'd that way, it vanished without any resistance or prevention by the Wisdom, Power, or Authority of Them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”IT seem'd the intention of that Declaration, whatsoever other End it had, was to Answer a Declaration, they had received from his Ma∣jesty, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in Answer to that which was presented to his Majesty at <HI>New-Market,</HI> the ninth of <HI>March</HI> last; and likewise his Answer to the Pe∣tition of both Houses, presented to him at <HI>York,</HI> the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>March:</HI> But, before it fell upon any Particular of his Majesty's Declaration or Answer, it complain'd that the Heads of the Malignant Party had, with much Art and Industry, advised him to suffer divers unjust Scan∣dals, and Imputations upon the Parliament, to be published in His Name, whereby they might make it odious to the People, and, by their help, destroy it: but not instancing in any one Scandal, or Im∣putation, so published by his Majesty, he was, he said, still to seek for the Heads of that Malignant Party. But his good Subjects would <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> easily understand, that if he were guilty of that aspersion, he must not only be active in raising the Scandal, but passive in the mischief be∣gotten by that Scandal, his Majesty being an Essential part of the Par∣liament; and he hoped the just Defence of Himself and his Authority, and the necessary Vindication of his Innocence and Justice, from the imputations laid on him, by a Major part then present of either or both Houses, should no more be called a Scandal upon the Parliament, than the Opinion of such a part be reputed an Act of Parliament: And he hoped his good Subjects would not be long misled, by that com∣mon expression in all the Declarations, wherein they usurp the word <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Parliament, and apply it to countenance any Resolution or Vote some few had a mind to make, by calling it the Resolution of Parliament; which could never be without his Majesty's Consent; neither could the Vote of either or both Houses make a greater alteration in the Laws of the Kingdom (so solemnly made by the advice of their Predecessors, with the Concurrence of his Majesty and his Ancestors) either by commanding, or inhibiting any thing (besides the known rule of the Law) than his single Direction or Mandate could do, to which he did not ascribe that Authority.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT that Declaration informed the People, that the Malignant <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Party had drawn his Majesty into the Northern Parts, far from his Parliament. It might, his Majesty said, more truly and properly have said, that it had Driven, than Drawn him thither; for, he confessed,
<PB N="466" REF="4840"/>
his Journey thither (for which he had no other reason to be sorry, than with reference to the Cause of it) was only forced upon him, by the true Malignant Party; which contrived and countenanced those barbarous Tumults, and other seditious Circumstances, of which he had so often complain'd, and hereafter should say more; and which indeed threaten'd so much danger to his Person, and laid so much Scan∣dal upon the Priviledge, and Dignity of Parliament, that he wonder'd it could be mention'd without blushes, or indignation: But of that, anon: But why the Malignant Party should be charged with the causing a Press to be transported to <HI>York,</HI> his Majesty said, he could not imagine; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> neither had any Papers or Writings issued from thence, to His know∣ledge, but what had been extorted from him by such Provocations, as had not been before offer'd to a King. And, no doubt, it would ap∣pear a most trivial, and fond Exception, when all Presses were open to vent whatsoever they thought fit to say to the People (a thing un∣warranted by former custom) that his Majesty should not make use of all Lawful means, to publish his just, and necessary Answers there∣unto. As for the Authority of the Great Seal (tho' he did not know that it had been necessary to things of that nature) the same should be more frequently used hereafter, as occasion should require; to which <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> he made no doubt, but the greater, and better part of his Privy Council would concur; and whose advice he was resolved to follow, as far as it should be agreable to the Good, and Welfare of the Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BEFORE that Declaration vouchsafed to insist upon any Particulars, it was pleased to censure both his Majesty's Declaration and Answer to be filled with harsh Censures, and causless Charges upon the Parlia∣ment (still misapplying the word Parliamennt to the Vote of both Houses) concerning which they resolve to give satisfaction to the King∣dom, since they found it very difficult to satisfy his Majesty. If, as in the usage of the word Parliament, they had left his Majesty out of their <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> thoughts; so by the word Kingdom, they intended to exclude all his People who were not within their Walls (for that was grown another Phrase of the time, the Vote of the Major part of both Houses, and sometimes of one, was now called the Resolution of the whole King∣dom) his Majesty believed, it might not be hard to give satisfaction to Themselves; otherwise he was confident (and, he said his confidence proceeded from the uprightness of his own Conscience) they would never be able so to sever the Affections of his Majesty and his King∣dom, that what could not be satisfaction to the One, should be to the Other: Neither would the Style of Humble, and Faithful, and telling <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty, that they will make him a Great and Glorious King, in their Petitions and Remonstrances, so deceive his good Subjects, that they would pass over the Reproaches, Threats, and Menaces they were stuffed with; which surely could not be more gently reprehended by his Majesty, than by saying, their Expressions were different from the usual Language to Princes; which that Declaration told him, he had no occasion to say: But he believed, whosoever looked over that De∣claration, presented to him at <HI>New-market,</HI> to which his was an An∣swer, would find the Language throughout it to be so Unusual, that, before this Parliament, it could never be parallel'd; whilst, under pre∣tence <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of justifying their Fears, they gave so much countenance to the discourse of the Rebels of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as if they had a mind his good Sub∣jects should give credit to it: Otherwise, being warranted by the same
<PB N="467" REF="4850"/>
evidence, which they have since published, they would have as well declared, That those Rebels publickly threaten the rooting out the Name of the English, and that they will have a King of their own, and no longer be govern'd by his Majesty, as that they say, That they do nothing, but by his Majesty's Authority; and that they call them∣selves the Queen's Army. And therefore he had great reason to com∣plain of the absence of Justice, and Integrity in that Declaration; be∣sides the unfitness of other Expressions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”NEITHER did his Majesty mistake the Substance, or Logick of their <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Message to him, at <HI>Theobalds,</HI> concerning the Militia; which was no other, and was stated to be no other, even by that Declaration that re∣proved him, than a plain Threat, That if his Majesty refused to joyn with them, they would make a Law without him: Nor had the Practice since that time been other; which would never be justified to the most ordinary if not partial understandings, by the meer averring it to be according to the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, without giving any directions, that the most Cunning and Learned Men in the Laws, might be able to find those Foundations. And he would appeal unto all the world, whether they might not, with as much Justice, and by <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> as much Law, have seised upon the Estate of every Member of both Houses, who dissented from that pretended Ordinance (which much the Major part of the House of Peers did, two or three several times) as they had invaded that Power of His over the Militia, because he, upon reasons they had not so much as pretended to Answer, refused to Consent to that Proposition.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND if no better Effects, than loss of Time, and hinderance of the publick Affairs, had been found by his Answers and Replies, all good Men might judge by whose Default, and whose want of Duty, such Effects had been; for as his End, indeed his only End, in those An∣swers <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and Replies, had been the settlement and composure of publick Affairs; so, he was assured, and most Men did believe, that if that due regard and reverence had been given to his Words, and that consent and obedience to his Counsels, which he expected, there had been, be∣fore that time, a chearful calm upon the face of the whole Kingdom; every Man enjoying his own, with all possible peace and security that can be imagined; which surely those Men did not desire, who (after all those Acts of Justice, and Favour passed by him, this Parliament; all those Sufferings, and Affronts, endured and undergon by him) thought fit still to reproach him with Ship-money, Coate and Conduct-money, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and other things so abundantly declared, as that Declaration it self confessed, in the general Remonstrance of the State of the King∣dom, published in <HI>November</HI> last? which his Majesty wonder'd to find now avow'd to be the Remonstrance of both Houses; and which, he was sure, was presented to him only by the House of Commons; and did never, and, he was confident, in that time could never have passed the House of Peers; the Concurrence, and Authority of which, was not then thought necessary. Should his Majesty believe those Re∣proaches to be the Voice of the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> That all his loving Subjects eased, refreshed, strengthen'd, and abundahtly satisfied <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> with his Acts of Grace and Favour towards them, were willing to be involved in those unthankful Expressions? He would appeal to the Thanks, and Acknowledgments published in the Petitions of most of the Counties of <HI>England;</HI> to the Testimony, and Thanks, he had
<PB N="468" REF="4860"/>
received from both Houses of Parliament; how seasonable, how agree∣able that usage was to his Majesty's Merit, or their former Expres∣sions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, he had not at all swerved, or departed from his Resolutions, or Words, in the beginning of this Parliament: He had said, he was resolved to put himself freely, and clearly upon the Love and Affection of his English Subjects; and he said so still, as far as con∣cerns <HI>England.</HI> And he called Allmighty God to Witness, all his Com∣plaints and Jealousies, which had never been causless, nor of his Houses of Parliament (but of some few Schismatical, Factious, and Ambi∣tious <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Spirits; and upon grounds, as he feared, a short time would justify to the world) his Denial of the Militia, his absenting himself from <HI>London,</HI> had been the effects of an upright, and faithful Affection to his English Subjects; that he might be able, through all the inconve∣niences he might be compelled to wrestle with, at last to preserve, and restore their Religion, Laws, and Liberties unto them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”SINCE the Proceeding against the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the five Members, was still looked upon, and so often pressed, as so great an advantage against his Majesty, that no Retractation made by him, nor no Action, since that time committed against Him, and the Law of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the Land, under the pretence of Vindication of Priviledge, could sa∣tisfy the Contrivers of that Declaration, but that they would have his good Subjects believe, The Accusation of those six Members must be a Plot for the breaking the Neck of the Parliament (a strange Arro∣gance if any of those Members had the Penning of that Declaration) and that it was so often urged against him, as if by that single, casual Mistake of his, in Form only, he had forfeited all Duty, Credit, and Allegiance from his People, he said, he would, without endeavouring to excuse that, which in truth was an Errour (his going to the House of Commons) give his People, a full, and clear narration of the matter <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of Fact; assuring himself, that his good Subjects would not find his carriage, in that business, such as had been reported.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, that when he resolved, upon such grounds, as, when they should be published, would satisfy the world, that it was fit for his own Safety, and Honour, and the Peace of the Kingdom, to proceed against those Persons; tho' he well knew, there was no de∣gree of Priviledge in that Case, yet, to shew his desire of Correspon∣dence with the two Houses of Parliament, he chose rather than to ap∣prehend their Persons by the ordinary Ministers of Justice (which, ac∣cording to the opinion, and practice of former times, he might have <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> done) to command his Atturney General, to acquaint his House of Peers with his intention, and the general matters of his charge (which was yet more particular, than a meer accusation) and to proceed ac∣cordingly; and at the same time sent a sworn Servant, a Serjeant at Armes, to the House of Commons, to acquaint them, that his Majesty did accuse, and intended to prosecute the five Members of that House for High-Treason; and did require, that their Persons might be se∣cured in Custody. This he did, not only to shew that he intended not to violate, or invade their Priviledges, but to use more Ceremony to∣wards them, than he then conceived in justice might be required of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> him; and expected at least such an Answer, as might inform him, if he were out of the way; but he received none at all; only, in the In∣stant, without offering any thing of their Priviledges to his consideration,
<PB N="469" REF="4870"/>
an Order was made, and the same night published in Print, That if any Person whatsoever, should offer to arrest the Person of any Mem∣ber of that House, without first acquainting that House therewith, and receiving further Order from that House, that it should be Lawful for such Member, or any Person, to resist them, and to stand upon his, or their Guard of Defence; and to make Resistance, according to the protestation taken to Defend the Priviledge of Parliament: And this was the first time that he heard the Protestation might be wrested to such a sense, or that in any Case, tho' of the most undoubted and un∣questionable <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Priviledge, it might be Lawful for any Person to resist, and use violence against a publick Minister of Justice, armed with Law∣ful Authority; tho' his Majesty well knew, that even such a Minister might be punished for executing such Authority.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”UPON Viewing that Order, his Majesty confessed, he was some∣what amazed, having never seen, or heard of the like; tho' he had known Members of either House committed, without so much For∣mality as he had used, and upon Crimes of a far inferiour nature to those he had suggested; and having no course proposed him for his Proceeding, he was, upon the matter, only told, that against those <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Persons he was not to proceed at all; that they were above His reach, or the reach of the Law. It was not easy for him to resolve what to do: If he imployed his Ministers of Justice in the usual way for their apprehension, who without doubt would not have refused to have executed his Lawful Commands, he saw what opposition, and resistance, was like to be made; which, very probably, might have cost some Blood: If he sate still, and desisted upon that Terrour, he should, at the best, have confessed his own want of Power, and the weakness of the Law. In that streight, he put on a suddain Resolution, to try whether his own Presence, and a clear discovery of his Intention, which happily <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> might not have been so well understood, could remove those Doubts, and prevent those Inconveniences, which seem'd to have been threaten'd; and thereupon, he resolved to go, in his own Person, to the House of Commons; which he discovered not, till the very minute of his going; when he sent out Orders, that his Servants, and such Gentlemen as were then in his Court, should attend him to <HI>Westminster;</HI> but giving them express Command, as he had expressed in his Answer to the Ordi∣nance, that no Accidents, or Provocation, should draw them to any such Action, as might imply a purpose of Force in his Majesty: And Himself, requiring those of his Train not to come within the Door, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> went into the House of Commons; the bare doing of which, he did not then conceive, would have been thought more a breach of Privi∣ledge, than if he had gone to the House of Peers, and sent for them to come to him; which was the usual custom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE used the best Expressions he could, to assure them how far he was from any intention of violating their Priviledges; that he intended to proceed legally, and speedily against the Persons he had accused; and desired therefore, if they were in the House, that they might be delivered to him; or if absent, that such course might be taken for their forth coming, as might satisfy his just Demands; and so he de∣parted, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> having no other purpose of Force, if they had been in the House, than he had before protested, before God, in his Answer to the Ordi∣nance. They had an account now of His part of that story fully; his People might judge freely of it. What followed on Their part (tho'
<PB N="470" REF="4880"/>
that Declaration said, it could not withdraw any part of their reverence and obedience from his Majesty; it might be any part of Theirs it did not) he should have too much cause hereafter to inform the World.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, there would be no end of this discourse, and of up∣braiding him with evil Counsellors, if, upon his constant denial of know∣ing any, they would not vouchsafe to inform him of them; and after eight Months amusing the Kingdom with the expectation of the dis∣covery of a Malignant Party, and of evil Counsellors, they would not at last name any, nor describe them. Let the Actions or Lives of Men be examined, Who had contrived, counselled, actually consented to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> grieve, and burthen his People; and if such were now about his Ma∣jesty, or any against whom any notorious, malicious crime could be proved, if He shelter'd and protected any such, let his Injustice be published to the world: but till that were done Particularly and Ma∣nifestly (for he should never conclude any Man upon a bare, general Vote of the Major part of either, or both Houses, till it were evident, that that Major part was without Passion or Affection) he must look upon the charge that Declaration put upon him, of cherishing and coun∣tenancing a discontented party of the Kingdom against them, as a hea∣vier and unjuster Tax upon his Justice and Honour, than any He had, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> or could lay, upon the framers of that Declaration. And now, to countenance those unhandsome Expressions, whereby they usually had implied his Majesty's connivance at, or want of Zeal against, the Re∣bellion of <HI>Ireland</HI> (so odious to all good Men) they had found a new way of exprobration: That the Proclamation against those bloody Traytors came not out, till the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> tho' that Rebel∣lion broke out in <HI>October;</HI> and then, by special command from his Majesty, but forty copies were appointed to be printed. His Majesty said it was well known where he was at that time, when that Rebel∣lion broke forth; in <HI>Scotland:</HI> That He immediately, from thence, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> recommended the care of that Business to both Houses of Parliament here, after he had provided for all fitting Supplies from his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland:</HI> That after his return hither, he observed all those Forms for that Service, which he was advised to by his Council of <HI>Ireland,</HI> or both Houses of Parliament here; and if no Proclamation issued out sooner (of which, for the present, he was not certain; but thought that others, by his directions, were issued before that time) it was, be∣cause the Lords Justices of the Kingdom desired them no sooner; and when they did, the Number they desired was but Twenty; which they advised might be signed by his Majesty; which he, for expedition of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the Service, commanded to be printed; a Circumstance not required by them: thereupon he signed more of them, than his Justices desired; all which was very well known to some Members of one, or both Houses of Parliament▪ who had the more to Answer, if they forbore to express it at the passing of that Declaration; and if they did express it, he had the greater reason to complain, that so envious an Aspersion should be cast on his Majesty to his People, when they knew well how to Answer their own Objection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WHAT that Complaint was against the Parliament, put forth in His Name, which was such an Evidence and Countenance to the Re∣bels, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and spoke the same Language of the Parliament which the Rebels did; he said he could not understand. All his Answers and Declara∣tions had been, and were, own'd by himself; and had been attested
<PB N="471" REF="4890"/>
under his own Hand; if any other had been published in his Name, and without his Authority, it would be easy for both Houses of Par∣liament to discover, and apprehend the Authors: And he wished, that whosoever was trusted with the Drawing, and Penning that Declara∣tion, had no more Authority, or Cunning to impose upon, or deceive a Major part of those Votes, by which it passed, than any Man had to prevail with his Majesty to publish in his Name any thing, but the sense, and resolution of his own Heart; or that the contriver of that Declaration could, with as good a conscience, call God to Witness, that <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> all his Counsels and Endeavours had been free from all private Aimes, personal Respects or Passions whatsoever, as his Majesty had done, and did, That he never had, or knew of any such Resolution of bringing up the Army to <HI>London.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND since that new Device was found out, instead of Answering his reasons, or satisfying his just demands, to blast his Declarations and Answers, as if they were not his own; a bold, sensless Imputation: He said he was sure, that every Answer, and Declaration, published by his Majesty, was much more his own, than any one of those bold, threatning, and reproachful Petitions, and Remonstrances, were the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Acts of either, or both Houses. And if the Penner of that Declara∣tion had been careful of the Trust reposed in him, he would never have denied (and thereupon found fault with his Majesty's just indignation) in the Text or Margent, that his Majesty had never been charged with the intention of any Force; and that in their whole Declaration, there was no one word tending to any such reproach; the contrary whereof was so evident, that his Majesty was, in express terms, charged in that Declaration, that he had sent them gracious Messages, when, with His privity, bringing up the Army was in agitation; and, even in that De∣claration, they sought to make the People believe some such thing to <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> be proved, in the depositions therewith published; wherein, his Ma∣jesty doubted not, they would as much fail, as they did in their censure of that Petition, shewed formerly to his Majesty by Captain <HI>Leg,</HI> and subscribed by him C. R. which, notwithstanding his Majesty's full, and particular narration of the substance of that Petition, the circumstances of his seeing and approving it, that Declaration was pleased to say, was full of Scandal to the Parliament, and might have proved dangerous to the whole Kingdom. If they had that dangerous Petition in their hands, his Majesty said, he had no reason to believe any tenderness to∣wards Him had kept them from communicating it; if they had it not, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty ought to have been believed: But that all good People might compute their other pretended dangers by their clear under∣standing of that, the noise whereof had not been inferiour to any of the rest, his Majesty said, he had recovered a true Copy of the very Petition he had signed with C. R. which should, in fit time, be published; and which, he hoped, would open the eyes of his good People.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”CONCERNING his Warrant for M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jermyn</HI>'s Passage, his Answer was true, and full; but for his black sattin Suit, and white Boots, he could give no Account.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty had complained in his Declaration, and, as often as he <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> should have occasion to mention his return, and residence near <HI>London,</HI> he should complain, of the barbarous and seditious Tumults at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and <HI>Westminster?</HI> which indeed had been so full of Scandal to his Government, and danger to his Person, that he should never think
<PB N="472" REF="4900"/>
of his return thither, till he had Justice for what was past, and Secu∣rity for the time to come: And if there were so great a necessity, or desire of his return, as was pretended, in all this time, upon so often pressing his desires, and upon causes so notorious, he should at least have procured some Order for the future. But that Declaration told his Majesty he was, upon the matter, mistaken; the resort of the Ci∣tizens to <HI>Westminster</HI> was as lawful, as the resort of great Numbers every day in the Term to the Ordinary Courts of Justice; They knew no Tumults. Strange! was the disorderly appearance of so many thousand People, with Staves and Swords, crying through the Streets, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Westminster</HI>-Hall, the Passage between both Houses (insomuch as the Members could hardly pass to and fro) <HI>No Bishops, down with the Bishops,</HI> No Tumults? What Member was there of either House, that saw not those Numbers, and heard not those Cries? And yet lawful Assemblies! Were not several Members of either House, assaulted, threatn▪d, and evilly entreated? And yet no Tumults! Why made the House of Peers a Declaration, and sent it down to the House of Commons for the suppressing of Tumults, if there were no Tumults? And if there were any, why was not such a Declaration consented to, and published? When the Attempts were so visible, and threats so <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> loud to pull down the Abby at <HI>Westminster,</HI> had not his Majesty just cause to apprehend, that such People might continue their work to <HI>White-Hall?</HI> Yet no Tumults! What a strange time are We in, that a few impudent, malicious ▪to give them no worse term) Men should cast such a Mist of errour before the eyes of both Houses of Parlia∣ment, as that they either could not, or would not, see how manifestly they injured themselves, by maintaining those visible untruths. His Majesty said, he would say no more: by the help of God and the Law, he would have Justice for those Tumults.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FROM excepting, how weightily every Man might judge, to what <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty had said, that Declaration proceeded to censure him for what he had Not said; for the prudent Omissions in his Answers: His Majesty had forborne to say any thing of the words spoken at <HI>Kensing∣ton;</HI> or the Articles against his dearest Consort, and the Accusation of the six Members: Of the last, his Majesty said, he had spoken often; and, he thought, enough of the other two; but having never accused any (tho' God knew what truth there might be in either) he had no reason to give any particular Answer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, de did not reckon himself bereaved of any part of his Pre∣rogative; which he was pleased freely, for a time, to part with by Bill; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> yet he must say, he expressed a great Trust in his two Houses of Par∣liament; when he devested himself of the power of dissolving this Par∣liament: which was a just, necessary, and proper Prerogative. But he was glad to hear their resolution, that it should not encourage them to do any thing, which otherwise had not been fit to have been done: If it did, it would be such a breach of Trust, as God would require an Account for at their hands.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Militia, he had said so much of it before, and the Point was so well understood by all Men, that he would waste time no more in that Dispute. He never had said, there was no such thing as an Or∣dinance, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> tho' he knew that they had been long difused, but that there was never any Ordinance or could be any, without the King's consent; and that was true: And the unnecessary Precedent, cited in that De∣claration,
<PB N="473" REF="4910"/>
did not offer to prove the contrary. But enough of that; God and the Law must determine that business.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”NEITHER had that Declaration, given his Majesty any satisfaction concerning the Votes of the fifteenth and sixteenth of <HI>March</HI> last; which he must declare, and appeal to all the world in the Point, to be the greatest violation of his Majesty's Priviledge, the Law of the Land, the Liberty of the Subject, and the Right of Parliament, that could be imagined. One of those Votes was, and there would need no other to destroy the King and People, That when the Lords and Com∣mons <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> (it is well the Commons are admitted to their part in Judicature) shall declare what the Law of the Land is, the same must be assented to, and obeyed: that is the sense in few words. Where is every Man's Property; every Man's Liberty? If the Major part of both Houses de∣clare, that the Law is, that the younger Brother shall inherit; what is become of all the Families, and Estates in the Kingdom; If they declare, that by the Fundamental Laws of the Land, such a rash Action, such an unadvised Word, ought to be punished by perpetual Imprison∣ment, is not the Liberty of the Subject, <HI>durante beneplacito,</HI> remedi∣less? That Declaration confesses, they pretend not to a power of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> making new Laws; that without his Majesty, they could not do That: They needed no such power, if their Declaration could suspend this Statute from being obeyed, or executed. If they had power to declare the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>'s waiting upon his Majesty, at <HI>Hampton</HI>-Court, and thence visiting some Officers at <HI>Kingston,</HI> with a Coach and six Horses, to be levying of War, and High-Treason; and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s de∣fying his Majesty to his face, keeping his Majesty's Town, Fort, and Goods against him, by force of Armes, to be an Act of Affection, and Loyalty; What needed a power of making new Laws? Or would there be such a thing as Law left?</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”HE desired his good Subjects to mark the reason, and consequence of those Votes; the progress they had allready made, and how infinite the progress might be. First, they Voted the Kingdom was in Immi∣nent danger (it was now above three Months since they discerned it) from Enemies abroad, and from a Popish, and disaffected party at home; that is matter of Fact; the Law follows: This Vote had given them Authority by Law, the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, to order and dispose of the Militia of the Kingdom; and, with this Power, and to prevent that danger, to enter into his Majesty's Towns, seise upon his Magazine, and, by Force, keep both from him. Was not <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that his Majesty's Case? First, they Vote he had an Intention to levy War against his Parliament; that is matter of Fact; Then they declare such as shall assist him, to be guilty of High-Treason; that is the Law, and proved by two Statutes Themselves knew to be repealed. No mat∣ter for that, They declare it. Upon this ground they exercise the Mi∣litia; and so actually do that upon his Majesty, which they had Voted He intended to do upon Them. Who could not see the confusion, that must follow upon such Power of Declaring? If they should now Vote that his Majesty did not write this Declaration, but that such a One did it, which was still matter of Fact; and then Declare, that, for <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> so doing, he was an Enemy to the Common-wealth; what was become of the Law that man was born to? And if all their Zeal for the de∣fence of the Law, were but to defend that which They Declared to be Law; their own Votes; it would not be in their power to satisfy any
<PB N="474" REF="4920"/>
Man of their good Intentions to the publick Peace, but such who were willing to relinquish their Title to <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and hold their Lives, and Fortunes, by a Vote of the Major part of both Houses. In a word, his Majesty denied not, but they might have power to declare in a par∣ticular, doubtful Case, regularly brought before them, what Law is: But to make a general Declaration, whereby the known rule of the Law might be crossed, or altered, they had no power; nor could exer∣cise any, without bringing the Life and Liberty of the Subject to a Lawless, and Arbitrary Subjection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty had complained (and the world might Judge of the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Justice, and Necessity of that complaint) of the multitude of seditious Pamphlets, and Sermons; and that Declaration told him, they knew he had ways enough in his ordinary Courts of Justice to punish those; so, his Majesty said, he had to punish Tumults and Riots; and yet they would not serve his turn to keep his Towns, his Forrests, and Parks from violence. And it might be, tho' those Courts had still the Power to punish, they might have lost the skill to define, what Tu∣mults and Riots are; otherwise a Jury in <HI>Southwark,</HI> legally impan∣nelled to examine a Riot there, would not have been superseded, and the Sheriff enjoyn'd not to proceed, by virtue of an Order of the House <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of Commons; which, it seem'd, at that time had the sole power of De∣claring. But it was no wonder that they who could not see the Tu∣mults, did not consider the Pamphlets and Sermons; tho' the Author of <HI>The Protestation Protested,</HI> were well known to be <HI>Burton</HI> (that infamous disturber of the Peace of the Church and State) and that he Preached it at <HI>Westminster,</HI> in the hearing of divers Members of the House of Commons. But of such Pamphlets and seditious Preachers (divers whereof had been recommended, if not imposed upon several Parishes, by some Members of both Houses, by what Authority his Majesty knew not) he would hereafter take a further Account.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, he confessed he had little skill in the Laws; and those that had had most, he found now were much to seek: Yet he could not understand or believe, that every ordinary Court, or any Court, had power to raise what Guard they pleased, and under what Command they pleased. Neither could he imagine, what dangerous Effects they found by the Guard he appointed them; or indeed any the least occasion, why they needed any Guard at all.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT of all the Imputations, so causlessly and unjustly laid upon his Majesty by that Declaration, he said, he must wonder at that Charge so apparently, and evidently Untrue; That such were continually pre∣ferred <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and countenanced by him, who were friends or favourers or related unto the chief Authors, and Actors of that Arbitrary Power heretofore practiced, and complained of: And on the other side, that such as did appear against it, were daily discountenanced, and disgraced. He said, he would know One Person that contributed to the ills of those times, or had dependence upon those that did, whom he did, or lately had countenanced, or preferred; nay he was confident (and he looked for no other at their hands) as they had been allways most Eminent Asserters of the publick Liberties; so if they sound his Ma∣jesty inclined to any thing not agreeable to Honour and Justice, they <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> would leave him to morrow. Whether different Persons had not, and did not receive countenance elsewhere, and upon what grounds, all men might judge; and whether his Majesty had not been forward
<PB N="475" REF="4930"/>
enough to honour and prefer those of the most contrary opinion, how little comfort soever he had of those Preferments, in bestowing of which, hereafter, he would be more guided by Men's Actions, than Opinions And therefore he had good cause to bestow that admoni∣tion (for his Majesty assured them, it was an admonition of his Own) upon both his Houses of Parliament, to take heed of inclining, under the specious shews of Necessity and Danger, to the exercise of such an Arbitrary Power, they before complain d of: The Advice would do no harm, and he should be glad to see it followed.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”HIS Majesty asked, if all the specious Promises, and loud Professions, of making him a great and a glorious King; of settling a greater Re∣venue upon his Majesty, than any of his Ancestors had enjoyed; of making him to be honour'd at home, and fear'd abroad; were resolved into this, That they would be ready to settle his Revenue in an Ho∣nourable proportion, when he should put himself in such a posture of Government, that his Subjects might be secure to enjoy his just Pro∣tection for their Religion, Laws, and Liberties? What posture of Go∣vernment they intended, he knew not; nor could he imagine what se∣curity his good Subjects could desire for their Religion, Laws, and Li∣berties, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> which he had not offer'd or fully given. And was it suitable to the Duty, and Dignity of both Houses of Parliament, to Answer his particular, weighty Expressions of the causes of his remove from <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> so generally known to the Kingdom, with a Scoff; That they hoped he was driven from thence, not by his own fears, but by the fears of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and his retinue of Cavaliers? Sure, his Ma∣jesty said, the Penner of that Declaration, inserted that ungrave and insolent Expression, as he had done divers others, without the consent, or examination of both Houses; who would not so lightly have de∣parted from their former professions of Duty to his Majesty.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”WHETHER the way to a good understanding between his Majesty, and his People, had been as zealously pressed by Them, as it had been professed, and desired by Him, would be easily discerned by them, who observed, that He had left no publick Act undone on His part, which, in the least degree, might be necessary to the peace, plenty, and secu∣rity of his Subjects: And that They had not dispatched one Act, which had given the least evidence of their particular affection, and kindness to his Majesty; but, on the contrary, had discountenanced and hin∣der'd the Testimony other Men would give to him of their affections. Witness the stopping, and keeping back the Bill of Subsidies, granted <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> by the Clergy allmost a year since; which, tho' his Personal wants were so notoriously known, they would not, to that time, pass; so not only forbearing to supply his Majesty themselves, but keeping the love, and bounty of other Men from him; and affording no other Answers to all his desires, all his reasons (indeed not to be Answer'd) than that he must not make his understanding, or reason, the Rule of his Go∣vernment; but suffer himself to be assisted (which his Majesty never denied) by his Great Council. He said, he required no other Liberty to his Will, than the meanest of Them did (he wished they would all∣ways use that Liberty) not to consent to any thing evidently contrary <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to his conscience, and understanding: And he had, and should allways give as much estimation, and regard to the Advice, and Counsel of both Houses of Parliament, as ever Prince had done: But he should never, and he hoped his People would never, account the Contrivance
<PB N="476" REF="4940"/>
of a few Factious, Seditious Persons, a Malignant Party, who would sacrifice the Common-wealth to their own fury and ambition, the Wisdom of Parliament; and that the justifying, and defending of such Persons (of whom, and of their particular, sinister ways, to compass their own bad ends, his Majesty would shortly inform the world) was not the way to preserve Parliaments, but was the opposing, and preferring a few unworthy Persons, before their Duty to their King, or their Care of the Kingdom. They would have his Majesty remem∣ber, that His Resolutions did concern Kingdoms, and therefore not to be molded by his own understanding: He said, he did well remember <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> it; but he would have Them remember, that when their Consulta∣tions endeavour▪d to lessen the Office, and Dignity of a King, they medled with that which is not within their determination, and of which his Majesty must give an Account to God, and his other King∣doms, and must maintain with the Sacrifice of his Life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”LASTLY, that Declaration told the People of a present, desperate, and malicious Plot the Malignant Party was then acting, under the plausible notions of stirring Men up to a care of preserving the King's Prerogative; maintaining the discipline of the Church; upholding and continuing the reverence, and solemnity of God's Service; and en∣couraging <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Learning (indeed plausible, and Honourable notions to act any thing upon) and that upon those grounds divers mutinous Peti∣tions had been framed in <HI>London, Kent,</HI> and other places: His Majesty asked upon what grounds these Men would have Petitions framed? Had so many Petitions, even against the form, and constitution of the Kingdom and the Laws established, been joyfully received, and ac∣cepted? And should Petitions framed upon those grounds be called Mutinous? Had a multitude of mean, unknown, inconsiderable, con∣temptible Persons, about the City, and Suburbs of <HI>London,</HI> had liberty to Petition against the Government of the Church; against the Book of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Common Prayer; against the Freedom, and Priviledge of Parliament; and been thanked for it; and should it be called Mutiny, in the greatest and best Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> and the Gentry and Commonalty of <HI>Kent,</HI> to frame Petitions upon those grounds; and to desire to be governed by the known Laws of the Land, not by Orders and Votes of either, or both Houses? Could this be thought the Wisdom, and Justice of both Houses of Parliament? Was it not evidently the work of a Faction, within or without both Houses, who deceived the Trust reposed in them; and had now told his Majesty, what Mutiny was? To stir Men up to a care of preserving his Prerogative, maintaining the discipline <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of the Church, upholding and continuing the reverence, and solem∣nity of God's Service, encouraging of Learning, was Mutiny. Let Heaven and Earth, God and Man, judge between his Majesty and these Men: And however such Petitions were there called Mutinous; and the Petitioners threatn▪d, discountenanced, censured, and imprisoned; if they brought such Petitions to his Majesty he would graciously re∣ceive them; and defend Them and their Rights, against w hat Power soever, with the uttermost hazard of his being.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, he had been the longer, to his very great pain, in this Answer, that he might give the world satisfaction, even in the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> most trivial Particulars, which had been objected against him; and that he might not be again reproached, with any more prudent Omis∣sions. If he had been compelled to sharper Language, than his Majesty
<PB N="477" REF="4950"/>
affected, it might be confider'd, how vile, how insufferable his Provo∣cations had been: And, except to repel force were to assault, and to give punctual and necessary Answers to rough, and insolent Demands, were to make Invectives, he was confident the world would accuse his Majesty of too much mildness; and all his good Subjects would think, he was not well dealt with; and would judge of his Majesty, and of their own happiness, and security in him, by his Actions; which he desired might no longer prosper, or have a Blessing from God upon them, and his Majesty, than they should be directed to the Glory of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> God in the maintenance of the true Protestant Profession; to the pre∣servation of the Property and Liberty of the Subject, in the observa∣tion of the Laws; and to the maintenance of the Rights and Freedom of Parliament, in the allowance and protection of all their just Pri∣viledges.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Declaration was no sooner published, but his Majesty likewise set forth an Answer to that other Declaration, of the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May;</HI> in which he said, <Q>“”That whosoever looked over the late Remonstrance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Answer to the Declaration of <HI>May 26. 1642.</HI></NOTE> entituled <HI>A Declaration of the Lords and Commons,</HI> of the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May,</HI> would not think that his Majesty had great reason to be pleased <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> with it; yet he could not but commend the plain dealing, and inge∣nuity of the framers, and contrivers of that Declaration (which had been wrought in a hotter and quicker forge than any of the rest) who would no longer suffer his Majesty to be affronted by being told, they would make him a great and glorious King; whilst they used all possi∣ble skill, to reduce him to extreme want, and indigency; and that they would make him to be loved at home, and feared abroad; whilst they endeavour'd, by all possible ways, to render him odious to his good Subjects, and contemptible to all Forreign Princes; but, like round dealing Men, told him, in plain English, That they had done <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> him no wrong, because he was not capable of receiving any; and that they had taken nothing from him, because he had never any thing of his own to lose. If that Doctrine were true, and that indeed he ought to be of no other consideration, than they had informed his People in that Declaration, that Gentleman was much more excusable, that said publickly, unreproved, That the happiness of the Kingdom did not depend on his Majesty, or upon any of the Royal branches of that Root: And the other, who said, his Majesty was not worthy to be King of <HI>England:</HI> Language very monstrous to be allow'd by either House of Parliament; and of which, by the help of God, and the Law, he must <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> have some examination. But he doubted not, all his good Subjects did now plainly discern, through the masque and vizard of their hy∣pocrisy, what their design was; and would no more look upon the fra∣mers and contrivers of that Declaration, as upon both Houses of Par∣liament (whose Freedom, and just Priviledges he would allways main∣tain; and in whose hehalf, he was as much scandalized as for Himself) but as a Faction of Malignant, and Schismatical, and Ambitious Per∣sons; whose design was, and allways had been, to alter the whole frame of Government, both of Church and State; and to subject both King and People to their own Lawless, Arbitrary Power, and Government: <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of whose Persons, and of whose designs, his Majesty said, he would, within a very short time, give his good Subjects and the world a full, and, he hoped, a satisfactory Narration.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THE Contrivers and Penners of that Declaration (of whom his
<PB N="478" REF="4960"/>
Majesty would be only understood too speak, when he mention'd any of their undutiful Acts against him) said, that the great Affairs of the Kingdom, and the miserable bleeding condition of <HI>Ireland,</HI> would afford them little leisure to spend their time in Declarations, Answers, and Replies. Indeed, his Majesty said, the miserable, and deplorable condition of both Kingdoms, would require somewhat else at their hands: But he would gladly know how they had spent their time, since the recess (then allmost eight Months) but in Declarations, Remon∣strances, and Invectives against his Majesty, and his Government; or in preparing matter for them. Had his Majesty invited them to any <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> such expence of time, by beginning Arguments of that Nature? Their Leisure, or their Inclination, was not as they pretended: And what was their printing and publishing their Petitions to him; their Decla∣rations▪ and Remonstrances of him; their odious Votes and Resolu∣tions, sometimes of one, sometimes of both Houses, against his Ma∣jesty (never in that manner communicated before this Parliament) but an Appeal to the People? And, in God's name, let them judge of the Persons they had trusted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEIR first quarrel was (as it was allways, to let them into their frank expressions of his Majesty, and his Actions) against the Ma∣lignant <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Party; whom they were pleased still to call, and never to prove to be his evil Counsellors. But indeed nothing was more evident by their whole proceedings, than that by the Malignant Party, they in∣tended all the Members of both Houses, who agreed not with them in their opinion (thence had come their distinction of good, and bad Lords; of Persons ill affected to the House of Commons; who had been proscribed, and their Names listed, and read in Tumults) and all the Persons of the Kingdom, who approve not of their Actions. So that, if in truth they would be ingenuous, and name the Persons they intended; Who would be the Men, upon whom the imputation of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Malignity would be cast, but They who had stood stoutly, and immu∣tably for the Religion, the Liberties, the Laws; for all publick In∣terest? <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>so long as there was any to be stood for) They, who had allways been, and still were, as zealous Professors, and some of them as able, and earnest Defenders of the Protestant Doctrine against the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as any were; Who had often, and earnestly besought his Majesty to consent, that no indifferent, and unnecessary Ceremony, might be pressed upon weak, and tender consciences, and that he would agree to a Bill for that purpose? They to whose Wisdom, Cou∣rage, and Counsel, the Kingdom owed as much as it could to Subjects; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and upon whose unblemished Lives, Envy it self could lay no impu∣tation; nor endeavoured to lay any, untill their Virtues brought them to his Majesty's Knowledge, and Favour? His Majesty said, if the Contrivers of that Declaration would be faithful to themselves, and consider all those Persons of both Houses, whom they, in their own consciences, knew to dissent from them in the Matter, and Language of that Declaration, and in all those undutiful Actions of which he complained, they would be found in Honour, Fortune, Wisdom, Re∣putation, and Weight, if not in Number, much superior to them. So much for the evil Counsellors. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEN what was the evil Counsel it self? His Majesty's coming from <HI>London</HI> (where He, and many, whose affections to him were very eminent, were in danger every day to be torn in pieces) to <HI>York;</HI>
<PB N="479" REF="4970"/>
where his Majesty, and all such as would put themselves under his Protection, might live, he thanked God and the Loyalty and Affection of that good People, very securely: His not submitting himself abso∣lutely (and renouncing his own understanding) to the Votes, and Re∣solutions of the Contrivers of that Declaration, when they told his Majesty, that they were above him; and might, by his own Autho∣rity, do with his Majesty what they pleased: and his not being con∣tented, that all his good Subject's Lives, and Fortunes, should be dis∣posed of by their Votes; but by the known Law of the Land. This <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> was the evil Connsel given, and taken: And would not all Men be lieve, there needed much power and skill of the Malignant Party, to infuse that Counsel into him. And then, to apply the Argument the Contrivers of that Declaration made for themselves, was it probable, or possible, that such Men, whom his Majesty had mention'd (who must have so great a share in the misery) should take such pains in the procuring thereof; and spend so much time, and run so many hazards, to make themselve Slaves, and to ruin the Freedom of this Nation?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said (with a clear, and upright Conscience to God All∣mighty) whosoever harboured the least thought in his breast, of ruin∣ing <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> or violating the publick Liberty, or Religion of the Kingdom, or the just Freedom and Priviledge of Parliament, let him be Accursed; and he should be no Counsellor of His, that would not say <HI>Amen.</HI> For the Contrivers of that Declaration, he had not said any thing, which might imply any Inclination in them to be Slaves. That which he had charged them with, was invading the publick Liberty; and his presumption might be very strong and vehement, that, tho' they had no mind to be Slaves, they were not unwilling to be Tyrants: What is Tyranny, but to admit no rules to govern by, but their own Wills? And they knew the misery of <HI>Athens</HI> was at the highest, when <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> it suffer'd under the thirty Tyrants.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, if that Declaration had told him (as indeed it might, and as in justice it ought to have done) that the Precedents of any of his Ancestors did fall short, and much below what had been done by Him, this Parliament, in point of Grace, and Favour to his People; he should not otherwise have wonder'd at it, than at such a truth in such a place. But when to justify their having done more, than ever their Predecessors did, it told his good Subjects (as most in∣juriously and insolently it did) that the highest, and most unwarrantable Precedents of any of his Predecessors did fall short, and much below <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> what had been done to them this Parliament by Him, he must confess himself amazed, and not able to understand them; and he must tell those ungrateful Men (who durst tell their King, that they might, without want of Modesty and Duty, Depose him) that the condition of his Subjects, when, by whatsoever Accidents and Conjunctures of time, it was at worst under his power, unto which, by no default of His, they should be ever again reduced, was, by many degrees, more pleasant and happy, than that to which their furious pretence of Re∣formation had brought them. Neither was his Majesty affraid of the highest Precedents of other Parliaments, which those men Boldly (his <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> good Subjects would call it worse) told him they might, without want of Modesty or Duty, make their Patterns. If he had no other secu∣rity against those Precedents, but Their modesty and duty, he was in a miserable condition, as all Persons would be who depended upon Them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="4980"/>
<Q>“”THAT Declaration would not allow his Inference, that by avow∣ing the Act of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> they did destroy the Title, and In∣terest of all his Subjects to their Lands, and Goods; but confessed, if they were found Guilty of that Charge, it were indeed a very great Crime. And did they not, in that Declaration, admit themselves guilty of that very Crime? Did they not say, Who doubts but that a Parliament may dispose of any thing, wherein his Majesty, or his Sub∣jects had a right, in such a way as that the Kingdom might not be in danger thereby? Did they not then call Themselves this Parliament, and challenge that Power without his Consent? Did they not extend <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> that Power to all Cases, where the necessity or Common Good of the Kingdom was concerned? And did they not arrogate to themselves alone, the Judgment of that Danger, that Necessity, and that Com∣mon Good of the Kingdom? What was, if That were not, to unsettle the security of all Men's Estates; and to expose them to an Arbitrary Power of their own? If a Faction should at any time by cunning, or force, or absence, or accident, prevail over a Major part of both Houses; and pretend that there were evil Counsellors, a Malignant Party, about the King; by whom the Religion, and Liberty of the Kingdom, were both in danger (this they might do, they had done it <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> then) they might take away, be it from the King, or People, what∣soever they, in their judgments, should think fit. This was Lawful, they had declared it so: Let the world judge, whether his Majesty had charged them unjustly; and whether they were not guilty of the Crime, which themselves confessed (being proved) was a great One; and how safely his Majesty might commit the power, those People desired, into Their hands; who, in all probability, would be no sooner possessed of it, than they would revive that Tragedy, which M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hooker</HI> related of the Anabaptists in <HI>Germany;</HI> who, talking of nothing but Faith, and of the true Fear of God, and that Riches and Honour were <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Vanity; at first, upon the great opinion of their Humility, Zeal, and Devotion, procured much reverence, and estimation with the People; after, finding how many Persons they had ensnared with their Hypo∣crisy, they begun to propose to themselves to reform both the Eccle∣siastical, and Civil Government of the State: Then, because possibly they might meet with some opposition, they secretly enter'd into a League of Association; and shortly after, finding the power they had gotten with the credulous People, enriched themselves with all kind of Spoile and Pillage; and justified themselves upon our Saviours pro∣mise, <HI>The meek shall inherit the Earth;</HI> and declared Their Title <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> was the same, which the righteous <HI>Israelites</HI> had to the Goods of the wicked <HI>Egyptians:</HI> His Majesty said, this story was worth the reading at large, and needed no application.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT his Majesty might by no means say, that He had the same Title to his Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> and the Ammunition there, as any of his Sub∣jects had to their Land, or Money: That was a Principle, that pulled up the Foundation of the Liberty, and Property of every Subject. Why? because the King's Property in his Towns, and in his Goods bought with the publick Money, as they conceive his Magazine at <HI>Hull</HI> to be, was inconsistent with the Subjects property in their Lands, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Goods, and Liberty. Did those Men think, that as they assumed a power of declaring Law (and whatsoever contradicted that Declaration broke their Priviledges) so that they had a power of declaring Sense,
<PB N="481" REF="4990"/>
and Reason, and imposing Logick, and Syllogisms on the Schools, as well as Law upon the People? Did not all Mankind know that several Men might have several Rights, and Interests in the self same House and Land, and yet neither destroy the other? Was not the Interest of the Lord <HI>Paramount</HI> consistent with that of the Mesne Lord; and His with that of the Tenant; and yet their Properties or Interests not at all confounded▪ And why might not his Majesty then have a full, Lawful Interest, and Property in his Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> and yet his Sub∣jects have a Property in their Houses too? But he could not sell, or <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> give away at his Pleasure this Town and Fort, as a private Man might do his Lands or Goods. What then? Many men have no Authority to let, or set their Leases, or sell their Land, have they therefore no Title to them, or Interest in them? May they be taken from them, because they cannot sell them? He said, the purpose of his Journey to <HI>Hull,</HI> was neither to sell, or give it away.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT for the Magazine, the Munition there, that he bought with his own Money, he might surely have sold that, lent, or given it away. No; he bought it with the publick Money; and the Proof is, They conceive it so; and, upon that Conceit, had Voted, that it should be <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> taken from him. Excellent Justice! suppose his Majesty had kept that Money by him, and not bought Armes with it, would they have taken it from him upon that Conceit: Nay might they not, wheresoever that Money was (for through how many hands soever it hath passed, it is the publick Money still, if ever it were) seise it, and take it from the owners? But the Towns, Forts, Magazine, and Kingdom, is en∣trusted to his Majesty; and he is a Person trusted. His Majesty said, he was so; God, and the Law had trusted him; and he had taken an Oath to discharge that Trust, for the good and safety of the People. What Oaths They had taken, he knew not, unless those, which, in that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> violence, they had manifestly, maliciously violated. Might any thing be taken from a Man, because he is trusted with it? Nay, may the Person himself take away the thing he trusts, when he will, and in what manner he will? The Law had been otherwise, and, he believed, would be so held, notwithstanding their Declarations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT that Trust ought to be managed by their Advice, and the King∣dom had trusted Them for that purpose. Impossible, that the same Trust should be irrevocably committed to his Majesty, and his Heirs for ever, and the same Trust, and a Power above that Trust (for so was the Power they pretended) be committed to others. Did not <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the People, that sent them, look upon them as a body but temporary, and dissolvable at his Majesty's pleasure? And could it be believed, that they intended them for his Guardians, and Controllers in the managing of that Trust, which God and the Law had granted to Him, and to his Posterity for ever? What the extent of the Commission, and Trust was, nothing could better teach them than the Writ, where∣by they are met. His Majesty said, he called them (and without that call, they could not have come together) to be his Counsellors, not Commanders (for however they frequently confounded them, the Of∣fices were several) and Counsellors not in all things, but in some things, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <HI>de quibusdam arduis</HI> &amp;c. And they would easily find among their Precedents, that Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> upon whose time all good Men looked with reverence, committed one <HI>Wentworth,</HI> a Member of the House of Commons, to the Tower, sitting the House, but for proposing that they
<PB N="482" REF="5000"/>
might advise the Queen, in a matter she thought they had nothing to do to meddle in. But his Majesty is trusted: And is He the only Per∣son trusted? And might they do, what their own inclination and fury led them to? Were They not trusted by his Majesty, when he first sent for them; and were they not trusted by him, when he passed them his promise, that he would not Dissolve them? Could it be presumed (and presumptions go far with Them) that he trusted them with a power to destroy himself, and to dissolve his Government, and Autho∣rity? If the People might be allowed to make an equitable construction of the Laws and Statutes, a Doctrine avowed by Them, would not all <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> his good Subjects swear, he never intended by that Act of Continuance, that they should do what they have since done? Were they not trusted by those that sent them? And were they trusted to alter the Govern∣ment of Church and State; and to make themselves perpetual Dicta∣tors over the King, and People? Did they intend, that the Law it self should be subject to their Votes; and that whatsoever They said, or did, should be Lawful, because They declared it so? The Oaths they had taken who sent them, and without taking which, themselves were not capable of their place in Parliament, made the one incapable of giving, and the other of receiving such a Trust; unless they could perswade <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> his good Subjects, that his Majesty is the only supreme Head, and Go∣vernour in all Causes, and over all Persons, within his Dominions; and yet that They had a Power over him to constrain him to manage his Trust, and Govern his Power, according to their Discretion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THE Contrivers of that Declaration told his Majesty, that they would never allow him (an humble, and dutiful expression) to be judge of the Law; That belonged only to Them; They might, and must, judge and declare. His Majesty said, they all knew what power the Pope, under pretence of interpreting Scriptures, and declaring Ar∣ticles of Faith, tho' he decline the making the one or the other, had <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> usurped over Men's consciences; and that, under colour of having power of ordering all things for the good of Men's Souls, he entitles himself to all the Kingdoms of the world: He would not accuse the Framers of that Declaration (how bold soever they were with his Majesty) that they inclined to Popery, of which another Maxim was, That all Men must submit their Reason and Understanding, and the Scripture it self, to that declaring power of his: Neither would he tell them, tho' They had told Him so, that they use the very Language of the Rebels of <HI>Ireland▪</HI> and yet they say those Rebels declare, that what∣soever they do, is for the Good of the King and Kingdom. But his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> good Subjects would easily put the case to themselves, whether if the Papists in <HI>Ireland</HI> in truth were, or, by Art or Accident, had made themselves the Major part of both Houses of Parliament there; and had pretended the Trust in that Declaration from the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> thereupon, had Voted their Religion and Liberty to be in danger of extirpation from a Malignant Party of Protestants, and Pu∣ritans; and therefore, that they would put themselves into a posture of Defence; that the Forts, and the Militia of that Kingdom were to be put into the hands of such Persons, as they could Confide in; that his Majesty was indeed trusted with the Towns, Forts, Magazines, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Treasures, Offices and People of the Kingdom, for the good, safety, and best advantage thereof; but as his Trust is for the use of the King∣dom, so it ought to be managed by the Advice of both Houses of Par∣liament,
<PB N="483" REF="5010"/>
whom the Kingdom had trusted for that purpose, it being their duty to see it discharged according to the condition, and true intent thereof, and by all possible means to prevent the contrary: His Majesty said, let all his good Subjects consider, if that Rebellion had been plotted with all that formality, and those circumstances declared to be legal, at least according to the Equitable sense of the Law, and to be for the publick good, and justifiable by necessity, of which They were the only Judges, whether, tho' they might have thought their design to be more Cunning, they would believe it the more Justifiable.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”NAY let the Framers of that Declaration ask themselves, if the evil Counsellors, the Malignant Party, the Persons ill affected, the Popish Lords and their Adherents, should prove now, or hereafter, to be a Major part of both Houses (for it had been declared that a great part of both Houses had been such, and so might have been the Greater; Nay, the greater part of the House of Peers was still declared to be such, and his Majesty had not heard of any of their conversion; and there∣upon it had been earnestly pressed, that the Major part of the Lords might joyn with the Major part of the House of Commons) would his Majesty be bound to consent to all such alterations, as those Men <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> should propose to him, and Resolve to be for the publick Good: And should the Liberty, Property, and Security of all his Subjects, depend on what such Votes should declare to be Law? Was the Order of the Militia unfit, and unlawful, whilst the Major part of the Lords refused to joyn in it (as they had done two or three several times, and it was never heard, before this Parliament, that they should be so, and so often pressed after a Dissent declared) and did it grow immediately necessary for the publick safety, and lawful by the Law of the Land, assoon as so many of the dissenting Peers were driven away (after their Names had been required at the Bar, contrary to the freedom, and founda∣tion <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of Parliament) that the other Opinion prevailed? Did the Life, and Liberty of the Subject depend upon such Accidents of days, and hours, that it was impossible for him to know his Right in either? God forbid.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT now, to justify their Invasion of his Majesty's ancient, un∣questioned, undoubted Right, settled and established on his Majesty and his Posterity by God himself; confirm'd, and strengthen'd by all possible Titles of Compact, Laws, Oaths, perpetual and uncontradicted Custom, by his People; What had they alledg'd to declare to the King∣dom, as They say, the obligation that lyeth upon the Kings of this <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Realm to pass all such Bills, as are offer'd unto them by both Houses of Parliament? A thing never heard of till that day: An Oath (Au∣thority enough for them to break all theirs) that is, or ought to be, taken by the Kings of this Realm, which is as well to remedy by Law such Inconveniences the King may suffer, as to keep, and protect the Laws allready in being: And the Form of this Oath, they said, did appear upon a Record there cited; and by a Clause in the Preamble of a Statute, made in the 25<SUP>th</SUP> year of <HI>Edw.</HI> III.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, he was not enough acquainted with Records to know whether that were fully, and ingenuously cited; and when, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> how, and why, the several Clauses had been inserted, or taken out of the Oaths formerly administer'd to the Kings of this Realm: Yet he could not possibly imagine the assertion that Declaration made, could be deduced from the words, or the matter of that Oath: for unless they
<PB N="484" REF="5020"/>
had a power of declaring Latin, as well as Law, sure, <HI>elegerit,</HI> signi∣fied <HI>hath</HI> chosen, as well as <HI>will</HI> choose; and that it signified so there (besides the Authority of the perpetual Practice of all succeeding times: a better Interpreter than their Votes) it was evident, by the reference it had to customs, <HI>consuetudines quas Vulgus elegerit:</HI> And could that be a Custom, which the People should choose after this Oath taken? And should a King be sworn to defend such Customs? Besides could it be imagined, that he should be bound by Oath to pass such Laws (and such a Law was the Bill they brought to him of the Militia) as should put the power, wherewith he was trusted, out of Himself into <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the hands of other Men; and divert and disable himself of all possible power to perform the great business of the Oath; which was to pro∣tect them? If his Majesty gave away all his power, or if it were taken from him, he could not protect any Man: And what discharge would it be for his Majesty, either before God or Man, when his Good Sub∣jects, whom God and the Law had committed to his charge, should be worried and spoiled, to say that he trusted others to protect them? That is, to do that Duty for him, which was essentially, and inse∣parably his own. But that all his good Subjects might see how faith∣fully these Men, who assumed this Trust from them, desired to dis∣charge <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> their Trust; he would be contented to publish, for their satis∣faction (a matter notorious enough, but what he himself never thought to have been put to publish, and of which the Framers of that Decla∣ration might as well have made use, as of a Latin Record they knew many of his good Subjects could not, and many of themselves did not understand) the Oath it self he took at his Coronation, warranted and enjoyn'd to it by the Customs, and directions of his Predecessors; and the Ceremony of theirs, and his taking it; they might find it in the Records of the Exchequer; This it is:</Q> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/></P>

<STAGE><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> The King Answereth;</STAGE>
<P>WITH a willing and devout heart I promise, and grant my Pardon; and that I will preserve and maintain to you, and the Churches com∣mitted to your Charge, all Canonical Priviledges, and due Law, and Justice, and that I will be your Protector and Defender, to my power, by the assistance of God, as every good King in his Kingdom in right ought to protect, and defend the Bishops, and the Churches under their Government.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> THEN the King ariseth, and is led to the Communion Table: where he makes a solemn Oath in sight of all the People, to observe the Pre∣mises; and, laying his Hand upon the Book, sayeth,</P>
<STAGE>The OATH,</STAGE>
<P>THE things which I have before promised, I shall persorm, and keep: So help me God, and the Contents of this Book.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty said, <Q>“”all the world might judge, whether such Doctrine or such Conclusions, as those Men brought, could follow, or have the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> least pretence, from that Oath: For the Preamble of the Statute they cited, that told his Majesty, that the King was bound to remedy, by Law, the mischiefs and damages which happen to his People: his Ma∣jesty said, he was so; but asked whether the King were bound, by the Preamble of that Statute, to renounce his own judgment, his own understanding in those mischiefs, and of these remedies? How far forth he was obliged to follow the judgment of his Parliament, that Declaration still confessed to be a question. Without question, he said, none could take upon them to remedy even mischiefs, but by Law, for fear of greater mischiefs than those they go about to remedy.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”BuT his Majesty was bound in justice to consent to their Proposals, because there was a Trust reposed in his Majesty to preserve the King∣dom, by making new Laws: He said, he was glad there was so; then
<PB N="486" REF="5040"/>
he was sure no new Law could be made without His consent; and that the gentleness of his Answer, <HI>le Roy S'avisera,</HI> if it be no Denial, it is no Consent; and then the matter was not great. They would yet allow his Majesty a greater latitude of granting, or denying, as he should think fit, in publick Acts of Grace, as Pardons, or the like Grants of favour: Why did they so? If those Pardons, and publick Acts of Grace were for the publick Good (which they might Vote them to be) they would then be absolutely in their own disposal: But had they left that power to his Majesty? They had sure, at least, shared it with him; How else had they got the power to pardon Serjeant-Major-Ge∣neral <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Skippon</HI> ▪a new Officer of State, and a Subject his Majesty had no Authority to send to speak with) and all other Persons imployed by them, and such as had imployed themselves for them, not only for what they had done, but for what they should do? If they had power to declare such Actions to be no Treason, which his Majesty would not pardon; such Actions to be Treason, which need no pardon; the Lati∣tude they allowed his Majesty of granting, or denying of Pardons, was a Jewel they might still be content to suffer his Majesty to wear in his Crown,</Q> and never think themselves the more in danger.</P>
<P><Q>“”ALL this consider'd, the Contriver of that Message (since they would <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> afford his Majesty no better Title) whom they were angry with, did not conceive, the People of this Land to be so void of Common Sense, as to believe his Majesty, who had denied no one thing for the ease, and benefit of them, which in Justice or Prudence could be asked, or in Honour and Conscience could be granted, to have cast off all care of the Subjects Good; and the Framers, and Devisers of that Declara∣tion (who had endeavour'd to render his Majesty odious to his Subjects, and them disloyal to him, by pretending such a Trust in them) to have only taken it up: Neither, he was confident, would they be satisfied, when they felt the misery and the burthens, which the fury and the <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> malice of those People would bring upon them, with being told that calamity proceeded from evil Counsellors, whom no body could name; from Plots and Conspiracies, which no Man could discover; and from Fears and Jealousies, which no Man understood: And therefore, that the consideration of it should be left to the Conscience, Reason, Af∣fection, and Loyalty of his good Subjects, who do understand the Go∣vernment of this Kingdom,</Q> his Majesty said, he was well content.</P>
<P><Q>“”His Majesty asked, where the folly and madness of those people would end, who would have his People believe, that his absenting himself from <HI>London,</HI> where, with his safety, he could not stay, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the continuing his Magazine at <HI>Hull,</HI> proceeded from the secret Plots of the Papists here, and to advance the design of the Papists in <HI>Ireland?</HI> But it was no wonder that they, who could believe S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s shutting his Majesty out of <HI>Hull,</HI> to be an Act of Affection and Loyalty, would believe that the Papists, or the Turk perswaded him to go thi∣ther.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”AND could any sober Man think, that Declaration to be the consent of either, or both Houses of Parliament, unawed either by fraud or force; which (after so many Thanks, and humble Acknowledgments of his gracious favour in his Message of the twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> so <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> often, and so unanimously presented to his Majesty from both Houses of Parliament) now told him, that the Message at first was, and, as often as it had been since mention'd by him, had been a breach of
<PB N="487" REF="5050"/>
Priviledge (of which they had not used to have been so negligent, as in four Months not to have complain'd, is such a breach had been) and that their own Method of proceeding should not be proposed to them; as if his Majesty had only Authority to call them together, not to tell them what they were to do; not so much as with reference to his own Affairs. What their own Method had been, and whether it had led Them, and brought the Kingdom, all Men see; what His would have been, if seasonably and timely applied unto, all Men might judge; his Majesty would speak no more of it.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”BUT see now▪ what excellent Instances, they had found out, to prove an inclination, if not in his Majesty, in some about him, to Civil War: Their going with his Majesty to the House of Commons (so often urg'd, and so fully Answer'd) their attending on him to <HI>Hampton</HI>-Court, and appearing in a Warlike manner at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames;</HI> His going to <HI>Hull;</HI> their drawing their Swords at <HI>York,</HI> demanding, who would be for the King; the declaring S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> Traytor, before the Message sent to the Parliament; the Propositions to the Gentry in <HI>York-shire,</HI> to assist his Majesty against S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> before he had received an Answer from the Parliament: All desperate Instances of <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> an inclination to a Civil War. Examine them again: The Manner, and Intent of his going to the House of Commons, he had set forth at large, in his Answer to their Declaration of the nineteenth of <HI>May;</HI> all Men might judge of it. Next, did they themselves believe, to what purpose soever that Rumour had served their turn, that there was an appearance in Warlike manner at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames?</HI> Did they not know, that whensoever his Majesty had been at <HI>Hampton</HI>-Court, since his first coming to the Crown, there was never a less ap∣pearance, or in a less Warlike manner, than at the time they meant? He said, he would say no more but that His appearance in a Warlike <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> manner at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Thames,</HI> and Theirs at <HI>Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Hull,</HI> was very different? What was meant by the drawing of Swords at <HI>York,</HI> and demanding, who would be for the King, must be enquired at <HI>London;</HI> for, his Majesty believed, very few in <HI>York</HI> understood the meaning of it. For his going to <HI>Hull,</HI> which they would by no means endure should be called a Visit, whether it were not the way to pre∣vent, rather than to make a Civil War, was very obvious: And the declaring him a Traytor in the very Act of his Treason, would never be thought unreasonable, but by those who believed him to be a loving, and loyal Subject; no more than the endeavouring to make the Gen∣tlemen <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of that County sensible of that Treason (which they were in an honourable, and dutiful degree) before he received the Answer from both Houses of Parliament: For, if they had been, as his Majesty ex∣pected they should have been, sensible of that intolerable injury offer'd to him, might he not have had occasion to have used the affection of these Gentlemen? Was he sure that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> who had kept him out without their Order (he spake of a publick Order) would have let him in, when they had forbidden him? And if they had not such a sense of him (as the case falls out to be) had he not more reason to make Propositions to those Gentlemen, whose readiness and affection <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> he, or his Posterity, would never forget?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT this business of <HI>Hull</HI> sticks still with them; and finding his Questions hard, they are pleased to Answer his Majesty by asking other Questions of Him: No matter for the exceptions against the Earl of
<PB N="488" REF="5060"/>
<HI>New-Castle</HI> (which have been so often urged, as one of the principal grounds of their Fears and Jealousies; and which drew that Question from him) They asked his Majesty, why, when he held it necessary, that a Governour should be placed in <HI>Hull,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> should be refused by him, and the Earl of <HI>New Castle</HI> sent down? His Majesty Answer'd because he had a better opinion of the Earl of <HI>New-Castle</HI> than of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham;</HI> and desired to have such a Governour over his Towns, if he must have any, as should keep them for, and not against him: And if his going down were in a more private way than S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s, it was because he had not that Authority to make a <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> noise by levying and billeting of Soldiers, in a peaceable time, upon his good Subjects, as it seem'd S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> carried down with him. And the Imputation which is cast by the way upon that Earl, to make his reputation not so unblemished, as He conceived, and the World be∣lieves it to be; and which, tho' it was not ground enough for Judicial Proceeding (it is wonder it was not) was yet ground enough for suspi∣cion, must be the case of every Subject in <HI>England</HI> (and he wished it went no higher) if every vile Aspersion, contrived by unknown hands, upon unknown or unimaginable grounds, which is the way practised to bring any Vertuous and deserving Men into obloquy, should receive <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the least credit, or countenance in the world.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THEY tell him, their Exception to those Gentlemen, who deliver'd their Petition to him at <HI>York,</HI> was, That they presumed to take the Style upon them of all the Gentry, and Inhabitants of that County; whereas, they say, so many more of as good Quality as themselves, of that County, were of another opinion; and have since, by their Petition to his Majesty, disavowed that Act. Their Information in that point, his Majesty said, was no better than it useth to be; and they would find, that neither the Number, or the Quality of those who have, or will disavow that Petition, was as they imagine; tho' too many weak <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Persons were misled (which they did, and would every day more and more understand) by the Faction, Skill, and Industry of that True Ma∣lignant Party, of which he did, and had reason to complain. They said, they had received no Petition of so strange a nature: What na∣ture? Contrary to the Votes of both Houses: that is, they had received no Petition, they had no mind to receive. But his Majesty had told them again, and all his good Subjects would tell them, that they had received Petitions, with joy and approbation, against the Votes of both Houses of their Predecessors, confirm'd and established into Laws by the consent of his Majesty, and his Ancestors; and allowed those Pe∣titions <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to carry the Style, and to seem to carry the Desires of Cities, Towns, and Counties, when, of either City, Town, or County, very few known, or considerable Persons, had been privy to such Petitions: whereas, in truth, the Petitions deliver'd to his Majesty, against which they except, carried not the Style of all, but some of the Gentry and Inhabitants; and implied no other consent, than such as went Visibly along with it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT his Majesty was all this while in a mistake; the Magazine at <HI>Hull</HI> was not taken from him. Who told them so? They who assure them (and whom without breaking their Priviledges they must be∣lieve) <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s shutting the Gates against his Majesty, and resisting his entrance with arm'd Men (tho' he thought it in de∣fiance of him) was indeed in obedience to him, and his Authority;
<PB N="489" REF="5070"/>
and for His Service, and the Service of the Kingdom. He was to let none in, but such as came with his Majesty's Authority, signified by both Houses of Parliament: himself and they had order'd it so. And therefore he kept his Majesty out, only till his Majesty, or he himself might send for their Directions. His Majesty, said, he knew not whe∣ther the Contrivers of that Declaration meant, that his good Subjects should so soon understand, tho' it was plain enough to be understood, the meaning of the King's Authority signified by both Houses of Par∣liament: But sure the world would now easily discern in what misera∣ble <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> case he had, by this time, been (it is bad enough as it is) if he had consented to their Bill, or to their Ordinance of the Militia, and given those Men power to have raised all the Armes of the Kingdom against him, for the Common Good, by his own Authority: Would they not, as they had kept him from <HI>Hull,</HI> by this time have beaten him from <HI>York,</HI> and pursued him out of the Kingdom, in his own behalf? Nay might not this Munition, which is not taken from him, be imployed against him; not against his Authority signified by both Houses of Par∣liament, but only to kill those ill Counsellors, the Malignant Party which is about him, and yet for His Good, for the Publick Good (they <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> would declare it so) and so no Treason within the Statute of 25 <HI>E.</HI> III? which, by their Interpretation, had left his Majesty the King of <HI>England</HI> absolutely less provided for, in point of safety, than the meanest Sub∣ject of the Kingdom: And every Subject of this Land (for whose se∣curity that Law wasmade, that they may know their duty, and their danger in breaking of it) may be made a Traytor when these Men please to say, he is so. But did they think That, upon such an Inter∣pretation (upon pretence of Authority of Book Cases and Precedents, which, without doubt, they would have cited, if they had been to their purpose) out of which nothing can result, but confusion to King <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and People, would find any credit with his good Subjects? And that so excellent a Law, made both for security of King and People, shall be so eluded, by an interpretation no Learned Lawyer in <HI>England</HI> would at this hour, he believed, set under his hand, notwithstanding the Authority of that Declaration; which, he hoped, shall bring no∣thing but Infamy upon the Contrivers of it?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”NOW to their Priviledges: Tho' it be true, they say, that their Pri∣viledges do not extend to Treason, Felony, or breach of the Peace, so as to exempt the Members from all manner of Process, and Trial; yet it doth priviledge them in the way, or method of their Trial: the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Cause must be first brought before Them, and Their consent asked, be∣fore you can proceed. Why, then their Priviledges extend as far in these Cases, as in any that are most unquestion'd; for no Priviledge whatsoever, exempts them from all manner of Process and Trial, if you first acquaint the House with it, and they give you leave to pro∣ceed by those Processes, or to that Trial: But, by this Rule, ifa Mem∣ber of either House commit a Murther, you must by no means meddle with him, till you have acquainted that House, of which he is a Mem∣ber, and received their direction for your Proceeding, assuring your self, he will not stir from that place where you left him, till you re∣turn <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> with their consent; should it be otherwise, it would be in the power of every Man, under the pretence of Murther, to take one af∣ter another, and as many as he pleaseth; and so, consequently, bring a Parliament to what he pleaseth, when he pleaseth. If a Member
<PB N="490" REF="5080"/>
of' either House shall take a purse at <HI>York</HI> (he may as probably take a Purse from a Subject, as Armes against the King) you must ride to <HI>London,</HI> to know what to do, and He may ride with you, and take a new purse every Stage, and must not be apprehended, or declared a Felon, till you have asked that House of which he is a Member; should it be otherwise, it might be in every Man's power to accuse as many Members as he would of taking Purses; and so bring a Parliament, and so all Parliaments, to nothing. Would these Men be believed? And yet they make no doubt but every one, who hath taken the Pro∣testation, would defend this Doctrine with his Life and Fortune. Would <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> not his Subjects believe, that they had imposed a pretty Protestation upon them; and that they had a very good end in the doing of it, if it obligeth them to such hazards, to such undertakings? Must they for∣get or neglect his Majesty's Person, Honour, and Estate, which, by that Protestation, they are bound to defend; and, in some degree, do un∣derstand? And must they only venture their Lives and Fortunes to justify Priviledges they know not, or ever heard of before? Or are they bound by that Protestation to believe, that the Framers of that Declaration have power to extend their own Priviledges, as far as they think fit; and to contract his Majesty's Rights, as much as they please; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and that they are bound to believe them in either, and to venture their Lives and Fortunes in that Quarrel?</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FROM declaring how mean a Person, his Majesty is, and how much the Kingdom hath been mistaken in the understanding of the Statute of the 25 <HI>E.</HI> III. concerning Treason, and that all Men need not fear levying War against him, so they have Their Order to Warrant them; They proceed, in the Spirit of Declaring, to certify his Subjects in the mistakings, which near one hundred and fifty years, have been re∣ceived concerning the Statute of the II <HI>Hen.</HI> VII. <HI>ch.</HI> I. (a Statute all good Subjects will read with Comfort) and tell them, that the serving <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of the King for the time being, cannot be meant of <HI>Perkin Warbeck,</HI> or of any that should call himself King; but such a One as is allowed, and received by the Parliament in the behalf of the Kingdom: And was not his Majesty so allowed? However, through a dark Mist of Words, and urging their old Priviledges (which, he hoped, he had suf∣ficiently Answer'd, and will be every day more confuted by the Actions of his good Subjects) they conclude, that those that shall guide them∣selves by the judgment of Parliament, which they say is their own, ought, whatsoever happen, to be secure, and free from all Account and Penalties, upon the ground, and Equity of that very Statute: How∣far <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> their own Chancellors may help them in that Equity, his Majesty knew not; but by the help of God and that good Law, He would allow no such Equity: So then, there is the Doctrine of that Declaration; and these are the Positions of the Contrivers of it.</Q></P>
<P N="1">1. THAT they have an absolute Power of declaring the Law; and that whatsoever they declare to be so, ought not to be question'd by his Majesty, or any Subject: So that all right and safety of Him and his People, must depend upon Their pleasure.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT no Precedents can be limits to bound their Proceedings: <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> So they may do what they please.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT the Parliament may dispose of any thing, wherein the King or Subject hath a Right, for the Publick Good; that they, without the
<PB N="49" REF="5090"/>
King, are this Parliament, and judge of this Publick Good; and that his Majesty's consent is not necessary: So the Life and Liberty of the Subject, and all the good Laws made for the security of them, may be disposed of, and repealed by the Major part of both Houses at any time present, and by any ways and means procured so to be; and his Ma∣jesty had no power to protect them.</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT no Member of either House ought to be troubled or medled with for Treason, Felony, or any other Crime, without the Cause first brought before Them, that they may judge of the Fact, and Their Leave <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> obtain'd to proceed.</P>
<P N="5">5. THAT the Soveraign Power resides in both Houses of Parliament; and that his Majesty had no Negative Voice: So then his Majesty Him∣self must be subject to their Commands.</P>
<P N="6">"6. THAT the levying of Forces against the Personal Commands of the King, tho' accompanied with his Presence, is not levying War against the King; but the levying War against his Laws and Authority (which They have power to declare, and signify) tho' not against his Person, is levying War against the King: And that Treason cannot be committed against his Person, otherwise than as he is entrusted with the Kingdom, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and discharging that Trust; and that They have a power to judge, whe∣ther he discharges that Trust or no.</P>
<P N="7">7. THAT if they should make the highest Precedents of other Par∣liaments their Patterns, there would be no cause to complain of want of Modesty or Duty in them; that is, they may Depose his Majesty when they will, and are not to be blamed for so doing.</P>
<P><Q>“”AND now (as if the meer publishing of their resolutions, would not only prevail with the People, but, in the instant, destroy all Spirit, and Courage in his Majesty to preserve his own right, and honour) <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> they had since taken the boldness to assault him with certain Propo∣sitions; which they call the most necessary effectual means for the re∣moving those Jealousies, and Differences between his Majesty and his People; that is, that he would be content to devest himself of all his Regal rights, and dignities; be content with the Title of a King, and suffer Them, according to their discretion to govern Him, and the Kingdom, and to dispose of his Children. How suitable and agreeable this Doctrine, and these Demands were to the affection of his loving Subjects, under whose Trust these Men pretend to Say, and Do these monstrous things; and to design not only the ruin of his Person, but <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of Monarchy it self (which, he might justly say, was more than ever was offer'd in any of his Predecessors times; for tho' the Person of the King hath been sometimes unjustly Deposed, yet the Regal Power was never, before this time, struck at) he believes his good Subjects would find some way to let Them, and the World know: And, from this time, such who had been misled, by Their ill Counsels, to have any hand in the execution of the Militia, would see to what Ends their ser∣vice was design'd; and therefore if they should presume hereafter to meddle in it, they must expect, that he would immediately proceed against them as actual raisers of Sedition, and as Enemies to his So∣veraign <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Power.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, he had done: And should now expect the worst Actions these Men had power to commit against him; worse Words they could not give him: And he doubted not, but the Major part of

<P>WHILST this Answer, and Declaration of his Majesty's was preparing <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and publishing, which was done with all imaginable hast, and to which they made no Reply till many Months after the War was begun, they proceeded in all their Counsels towards the lessening his Majesty both in Reputation, and Power; and towards the improving their own In∣terests: For the first, upon the advantage of their former Vote, of the King's Intention to levy War against his Parliament, in the end of <HI>May</HI> they published Orders, <Q>“”That the Sheriffs of the adjacent Counties should hinder, and make stay of all Armes and Ammunition carrying towards <HI>York,</HI> until they had given notice thereof unto the Lords and Commons; and should have received Their further Direction; <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and that they should prevent the coming together of any Soldiers, Horse or Foot, by any Warrant of his Majesty, without Their Advice or Consent: Which they did,</Q> not upon any opinion that there would be any Armes or Ammunition carrying to his Majesty, they having entirely possessed themselves of all his Stores; or that they indeed be∣lieved, there was any Commission or Warrant to raise Soldiers, which they well knew there was not; but that, by this means, their Agents in the Country (which many Sheriffs and Justices of Peace were; and most Constables, and Inferior Officers) might, upon this Pretence, hinder the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orting to his Majesty, which they did with that Industry, that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> few Persons, who foreseeing the design of those Orders, did not decline the great Roades, and made not pretences of travelling to some other place, and travelled in any Equipage towards his Majesty, escaped with∣out being stayed by such watches: And most that were so stayed, find∣ing it to no purpose to attend the Resolution, or Justice of the Houses, who allways commended the vigilance of their Ministers, and did not expect, they should be bound up by the Letter of their Orders, made shift to escape with their own Persons, and were contented to leave their Horses behind them: They, who attended to be repaired by the Justice of the Houses, finding so many delays, and those delays to be so charge∣able, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and themselves exposed to so many Questions, and such an Inqui∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, that they thought their Liberty a great prize, whatever they left behind them.</P>
<P>FOR the improving their Interest, and Dependance, tho' they had as much of the Affection of the City as could reasonably be expected; and, by their exercise of the Militia, had united them in a firm Bond, the communication of Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt; yet they well understood their true strength <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Rabble of the People, far the greatest part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and wealthy Citizens, being not of their Party; and except some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were found out, whereby they might be involved, and <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> concerned in their Prosperity or Ruin, they thought themselves not so much in tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h possessed of that City, as they seem'd to be They had heard it said, that <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth of <HI>England</HI> recover'd the City of

Upon this ground, they had taken the first Opportunity of borrowing great Sums of them, in the beginning of this Parliament; when the richest and best affected Men, upon a presumption that hereby the Scots Army would suddainly March into their own Country, and the English assoon be disbanded, chearfully furnished that Money. Upon this ground, they still forbore to repay those Sums, disposing what was brought in upon the Bills of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Subsidy, and other publick Bills, to other purposes. And now, to make themselves more sure of them, they borrowed another Sum of 100000<SUP>1</SUP>. of them, upon pretence of the great Exigences of <HI>Ireland;</HI> which was their two edged Sword, to lead them into the Liberty of laying what Imputations, they thought most convenient for their purposes, upon the King and Queen; and to draw what Money they thought fit from the City; and served them now to another important end, to raise Soldiers; but that Service it self, in order to suppressing the Rebellion there, was not, in any degree, advanced. Having, by these means, thus provided for their main Ends, they made the People believe, they were preparing <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Propositions to send to the King; and the People were yet so innocent as to believe, that they would never send Propositions that were not reasonable: For tho' the unusual Acts which had been done by the King, as the going to the House of Commons, and demanding the Members there, had put them into as unusual apprehensions; and those, by the warmth and heat of Declarations and Answers, had drawn from them, by degrees, another kind of Language, than had before been used; yet most Men believed, when those passions were disgested, and that any Propositions should be made by them (which the King had long called for and invited) that they could not but be such, as would open a door <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> for that Affection, Confidence, Duty and Trust, upon which the Peace of the Kingdom might be reasonably founded. And Propositions they did send to the King, in the beginning of <HI>June;</HI> which were presented to his Majesty, with great Solemnity, by their Committee resident there; which, in this place, are very necessary to be inserted in the very terms in which they were presented, as followeth:

THE same day that these Articles of Deposition were pass'd the Houses, that his Majesty might see how unable he was like to be to contend with them, they declared by an Order, the same day printed and carefully dispersed, "that they had received Information (and indeed their In∣formations were wonderful particular, from all parts beyond Sea, of whatsoever was agitated on the King's behalf; as well as from his Court, of whatsoever was design'd, or allmost but thought of to himself: Be∣sides they could pretend to receive Information of whatsoever would any way conduce to their Purpose, true or false) <Q>“”that the Jewels of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Crown (which, they said, by the Law of the Land ought not to be aliened) were either pawn'd or sold in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> or some other parts beyond Seas; and thereby great Sums of Money provided to be return'd to <HI>York,</HI> or to some of his Majesty's Servants or Agents, for his Majesty's use: And because, they said, it was more than probable, that great provision of Moneys, in such an extraordinary way, was to maintain the intended War against the Parliament; and thereby to bring the whole Kingdom into utter ruin, and combustion: It was therefore declared, by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Order of the two Houses against pawn∣ing the Jewels of the Crown.</NOTE> whosoever had been, or should be, an Actor in the selling or pawning <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of any Jewels of the Crown; or had, or should pay, lend, send, or bring any Money in Specie into this Kingdom for, or upon, any of those Jewels; or whosoever had, or should accept of any Bill from beyond the Seas for the payment of any Sum of Money, for or upon any of those Jewels, and should pay any Sum according to such Bill, after notice of that Order, without acquainting that House with the Receipt of that Bill, before he accept the same; or if he had allready accepted any such Bill, then with the Acceptance thereof, before the payment of the Money, every such Person should be held and accounted a Pro∣moter of that intended War, an Enemy to the State, and ought to give <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> satisfaction for the publick damage out of his own Estate.</Q></P>
<P>UPON this consident Assumption, <Q>“”that it was not in the King's power to dispose the Jewels of the Crown; that whatsoever Jewels were offer'd to be pawn'd or sold, by any of the King's Ministers be∣yond the Seas, were the Jewels of the Crown, and no other; and that all money, return'd from thence for his Majesty's Service, was money so raised and procured;</Q> they so much terrified Men of all conditions, that the Queen, having, by the Sale of some of her own Jewels, and by her other Dexterity, procured some Money for the King's supply, could not in a long time find any means to transinit it. However this made <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> no impression upon the King's Resolution; and tho' it might have some influence upon Merchantly Men, yet it stirred up most Generous minds to an Indignation on the King's behalf; and was new Evidence, if there had wanted any, what kind of Greatness he was to expect from comply∣ing with such immodest, and extravagant Proposers.</P>
<P>THE King was once resolved to have return'd no Answer to them upon those Propositions; but to let the People alone to judge of the un∣reasonableness of them, and of the Indignity offer'd to him in the deli∣very of them; and that was the reason of the short mention he made of them, in the close of his Declaration to theirs of the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May:</HI> But <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> he was afterwards perswaded to vouchsafe a further notice of them, there being some particulars Popular enough, and others, that, at the first View, seem'd not alltogether so derogatory to Him, and so incon∣venient to the People, as in truth they were; and that therefore it was
<PB N="498" REF="5160"/>
necessary to let all the People know, that whatsoever was reasonable, and might be beneficial to the Kingdom, had been, for the most part, be∣fore offer'd by his Majesty; and should all be readily granted by him; and so to unfold the rest to them, that they might discern their own Welfare, and Security, to be as much endangered by those Demands, as the King's Rights, Honour, and Dignity: So that, in a short time after he received them, he sent to the two Houses, and published to the King∣dom, his Answer to those Nineteen Propositions; whereof it will be sufficient to repeat some few Particulars:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> <Q>“”IN which he first remember'd them of their method, they had ob∣served <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> in their proceedings towards him: That they had first totally suppressed the known Law of the Land, and denied His power to be necessary to the making New, reducing the whole to their own De∣clarations, and single Votes: That they had possessed themselves of his Magazines, Forts, and Militia: That they had so awed his Subjects with Pursuivants, long chargeable Attendance; heavy Censures; il∣legal Imprisonments; that few of them durst offer to present their ten∣derness of his Majesty's sufferings, their own just grievances, and their sense of those Violations of the Law (the Birthright of every Subject of the Kingdom) tho' in an humble Petition to both Houses; and if <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> any did, it was stifled in the Birth; called Sedition; and burn'd by the Common Hangman: That they had restrained the attendance of his ordinary, and necessary Household-Servants; and seised upon those small Sums of Money, which his credit had provided to buy him Bread; with Injunctions that no Money should be suffer'd to be con∣veyed, or returned to his Majesty to <HI>York,</HI> or to any of his Peers, or Servants with him; so that, in effect, they had blocked him up in that County: That they had filled the Ears of his People with Fears and Jealousies, (tho' taken up upon trust) tales of Skippers, Salt Fleets, and such like; by which Alarms they might prepare them to receive <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> such Impressions, as might best advance their Design, when it should be ripe. And now, it seem'd, they thought his Majesty sufficiently prepared for those bitter Pills; that he was in a handsome posture to receive those humble Desires; which, probably, were intended to make way for a Superfoetation of a yet higher nature; for they did not tell him, This was All. He said, he must observe, that those Contrivers (the better to advance their true ends) in those Propositions, disguised, as much as they could, their Intents with a mixture of some things really to be approved by every honest Man; others, Specious and Po∣pular; and some which were allready granted by his Majesty: All <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> which were cunningly twisted, and mixed with those other things of their main design, of Ambition and private Interest, in hope that, at the first View, every Eye might not so clearly discern them in their proper Colours.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, if the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19, Demands had been writ, and printed, in a Tongue unknown to his Majesty and his People, it might have been possible, that He, and They might have charitably believ'd the Propositions to be such, as might have been in order to the Ends pretended in the Petition; to wit, the Establish∣ment of his Honour and Safety; the welfare and security of his Sub∣jects <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and Dominions; and the removing those Jealousies and Differences, which were said to have unhappily fallen betwixt his Majesty and his People; and procuring both his Majesty, and Them, a constant
<PB N="499" REF="5170"/>
course of Honour, Peace, and Happiness; but being read and under∣stood by all, he could not but assure himself, that that Profession, joyn'd to those Propositions, would rather appear a Mockery, and a Scorn; the Demands being such, that he were unworthy of the Trust reposed in him by the Law, and of his Descent from so many great and famous Ancestors, if he could be brought to abandon that Power, which alone could enable him to perform what he was sworn to, in protecting his People, and the Laws; and So assume others into it, as to devest Him∣self of it, altho' not only his present condition were more Necessitous <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> than it was (which it could hardly be) and he were both Vanquished, and a Prisoner, and in a worse condition than ever the most unfor∣tunate of his Predecessors had been reduced to, by the most Criminal of their Subjects; and tho' the Bait laid to draw him to it, and to keep his Subjects from Indignation at the mention of it, the Promises of a plentiful and unparellel'd Revenue, were reduced from Generals (which signify nothing) to clear and certain Particulars; since such a bargain would have but too great a resemblance of that of <HI>Esau's,</HI> if he would part with such flowers of his Crown, as were worth all the rest of the Garland, and had been transmitted to him from so many <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Ancestors, and had been found so useful and necessary for the welfare and security of his Subjects, for any present Necessity, or for any low and sordid Considerations of Wealth and Gain. And therefore, all Men knowing that those Accommondations are most casily made, and most exactly observed, that are grounded upon reasonable and equal conditions, his Majesty had great cause to believe that the Contrivers of those Propositions, had no Intention of settling any firm Accommo∣dation; but to increase those Jealousies, and widen that Division, which, not by his Majesty's fault, was now unhappily faln between Him and both Houses.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”IT was asked, that all Lords and Others of his Privy Council, and such great Officers and Ministers of State, either at home or beyond the Seas (for, he said, care was taken to leave out no Person, or Place, that his dishonour might be sure not to be bounded within this King∣dom) should be put from his Privy Council, and from those Offices and Imployments, unless they should be approved by both Houses of Parliament, how faithful soever his Majesty had found them to Him, and to the Publick; and how far soever they had been from offending against any Law, the only Rule they had, or any others Ought to have, to walk by. His Majesty therefore to that part of that Demand re∣turn'd <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> this Answer, That he was willing to grant, that they should take a larger Oath, than they Themselves desired in their eleventh De∣mand, for maintaining not of any Part, but the Whole Law: And, he said, he had, and did assure them, that he would be careful to make election of such Persons in those Places of Trust, as had given good testimonies of their Abilities and Integrities, and against whom there could be no just cause of Exception, whereon reasonably to ground a Diffidence: That if he had, or should be mistaken in his election, he had, and did assure them, that there was no man so near to him, in Place or Affection, whom he would not leave to the Justice of the Law, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> if they should bring a particular Charge, and sufficient Proof against him: That he had given them a Triennial Parliament (the best pledge of the Effects of such a Promise on his part, and the best security for the performance of their Duty on Theirs) the apprehension of whose
<PB N="500" REF="5180"/>
Justice, would, in all probability, make Them wary how they pro∣voked it; and his Majesty wary, how he chose such as, by the disco∣very of their faults, might in any degree seem to discredit his Election; but that without any shadow of a fault objected, only perhaps because they follow their Consciences, and preserve the established Laws, and agree not in such Votes, or assent not to such Bills, as some Persons, who had then too great an influence even upon both Houses, judged, or seem▪d to judge, to be for the publick good, and as were agreeable to that new Utopia of Religion and Government, into which they en∣deavour'd to transform this Kingdom (for, he said, he remember'd <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> what Names, and for what reasons, they left out in the Bill offer'd him concerning the Militia, which they had themselves recommended in the Ordinance) he would never consent to the displacing of any, whom for their former Merits from, and Affection to his Majesty and the Publick, he had entrusted; since, he conceived, that to do so, would take away both from the Affection of his Servants, and care of his Ser∣vice, and the Honour of his Justice: And, he said, he the more won∣der'd, that it should be asked by them, since it appears by the twelfth Demand, that Themselves counted it reasonable, after the present Turn was served, that the Judges and Officers, who were then placed, might <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> hold their Places, <HI>quamdiu se bene gesserint:</HI> And he was resolved to be as careful of those whom He had chosen, as they were of those They would choose; and to remove none, till they appeared to him to have otherwise behaved themselves, or should be evicted, by Legal pro∣ceedings, to have done so.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”BUT, his Majesty said, that Demand, as unreasonable as it was, was but one Link of a great Chain, and but the first Round of that Ladder, by which his Majesty's Just, Ancient, Regal Power, was en∣deavoured to be setched down to the ground; for it appeared plainly that it was not with the Persons now chosen, but with his Majesty's <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Choosing, that they were displeased: For they demanded, that the Per∣sons put into the Places and Imployments of those, who should be re∣moved, might be approved by both Houses; which was so far from being less than the power of Nomination, that of two things, of which he would never grant either, he would sooner be content, that They should Nominate, and He Approve; than they Approve and his Ma∣jesty Nominate; the meer Nomination being so far from being any thing, that if he could do no More, he would never take the pains to do That; when he should only hazard whom he esteem'd to the Scorn of a Refusal, if they happen▪d not to be agreeable not only to the Judg∣ment, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> but to the Passion, Interest, or Humour of the present Major part of either House: Not to speak of the great Factions, Animosities, and Divisions, which that power would introduce in both Houses, and in the several Counties for the choice of Persons to be sent to that place, where that power was; and between the Perfons that were so chosen. Neither was that strange Potion prescribed to him only for once, for the cure of a present, pressing, desperate Disease; but for a Diet to Him, and his Posterity. It was demanded, that his Counsellors, all Chief Officers both of Law and State, Commanders of Forts and Castles, and all Peers hereafter made, be Approved of, that is Chosen, by Them <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> from time to time: And rather than it should ever be left to the Crown (to whom it only did, and should belong) if any place fall void in the intermission of Parliament, the Major part of the approved Council
<PB N="501" REF="5190"/>
was to approve them. Neither was it only demanded that his Ma∣jesty should quit the power, and right, his Predecessors had had of ap∣pointing Persons in those Places; but for Counsellors, he was to be re∣strain'd, as well in the Number as in the Persons; and a power must be annexed to those Places, which their Predecessors had not. And indeed, if that power were passed to them, he said, it would not be fit He should be trusted to choose those, who were to be trusted as much as Himself.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE told them, to grant their Demands in the manner they proposed <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> them, that all Matters that concern'd the Publick &amp;c. should be re∣solved, and transacted only in Parliament, and such other matters of State &amp;c. by the Privy Council so chosen, was in effect at once to de∣pose Himself, and his Posterity. He said, many expressions in their Demands, had a greater Latitude of signification, than they seem'd to have; and that it concern'd his Majesty therefore the more, that they should speak out; that both He, and his People, might either know the bottom of their demands, or know them to be bottomless. Nothing more concern'd the Publick, and was indeed more proper for the high Court of Parliament, than the making of Laws; which not only ought <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="line"/> there to be transacted, but could be transacted no where else. But then they must admit his Majesty to be a Part of the Parliament; they must not (as the sense was of that part of that Demand, if it had any) deny the freedom of his Answer, when He had as much right to reject what he thought unreasonable, as They had to propose what they thought convenient, or necessary. Nor was it possible his Answers, either to Bills or any other Propositions, should be wholely free, if he might not use the liberty, that every one of Them, and every Sub∣ject took, to receive Advice (without their danger who should give it) from any Person known or unknown, sworn or unsworn, in those <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> matters in which the manage of his Vote is trusted, by the Law, to his own judgment and conscience; which how best to inform was, and ever should be, left likewise to Him. He said, he would allways, with due consideration, weigh the Advices both of his Great, and Privy Council; yet he should likewise look on their Advices, as Advices, not as Commands, or Impositions; upon them, as his Counsellors, not as his Tutors, or Guardians; and upon Himself, as their King, not as their Pupil, or Ward: For, he said, whatsoever of Regality was, by the mo∣desty of Interpretation, left in his Majesty, in the first part of the se∣cond Demand, as to the Parliament, was taken from him, in the second <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> part of the same, and placed in that new fangled kind of Counsellors, whose power was such, and so expressed by it, that in all Publick Acts concerning the Affairs of the Kingdom, which are proper for the Privy Council (for whose Advice all Publick Acts are sometimes proper, tho' never necessary) they were desired to be admitted joynt Patentees with his Majesty in the Regality. And it was not plainly expressed, whe∣ther they meant his Majesty so much as a single Vote in those Affairs; but it was plain they meant him no more, at most, than a single Vote in them; and no more power, than every one of the rest of his fellow Counsellors.</Q></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> AND so after a sharp discourse, and explanation of the unreasonable∣ness of the several Demands, or the greatest part of them, and the con∣fusion that, by consenting thereunto, would redound to the Subject in general, as well as the dishonour to his Majesty (which may be read

at large by it self) He told them, <Q>“”to all those unreasonable demands, his Answer was, <HI>nolumus leges Angliae mutari:</HI> But renewed his Pro∣mise to them, for a very punctual and strict observation of the known Laws established; to which purpose he was willing an Oath should be framed by them, and taken by all his Privy Counsellors. And for any alteration in the Government of the Church, that a National Synod should be called, to propose what should be found necessary or conve∣nient: And that for the advancement of the Protestant Religion against the Papists, they had not proposed so much to his Majesty, as he was willing to grant, or as he had himself offer'd before. He concluded <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> with conjuring Them, and all Men, to rest satisfied with the truth of his Majesty's Professions, and the reality of his Intentions; and not to ask such things as denied themselves: That they would declare against Tumults, and punish the Authors: That they would allow his Majesty his Property in his Towns, Armes, and Goods; and his share in the Legislative Power; which would be counted in Him, not only breach of Priviledge, but Tyranny, and Subversion of Parliaments, to deny to Them: And, when they should have given him satisfaction upon those Persons, who had taken away the One, and recalled those De∣clarations (particularly that of the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May;</HI> and those in the point <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of the Militia, his just rights wherein he would no more part with, than with his Crown, left he enabled others by them to take that from him) which would take away the Other; and declined the beginnings of a War against his Majesty, under pretence of His intention of making one against Them; as he had never opposed the First part of the thir∣teenth Demand, so he would be ready to concur with them in the Latter; and being then confident that the credit of those Men, who desire a general combustion, would be so weaken'd with them, that they would not be able to do this Kingdom any more hurt, he would be willing to grant his General Pardon, with such Exceptions as should <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> be thought fit; and should receive much more joy in the hope of a full, and constant happiness of his People in the true Religion, and under the protection of the Law, by a blessed union between his Majesty and his Parliament, than in any such increase of his own Revenue, how much soever beyond former Grants, as (when his Subjects were weal∣thiest) his Parliament could have settled upon his Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>THO' the King now lived at <HI>York</HI> in a much more Princely condition, than he could have hoped to have done near <HI>London;</HI> and had so great a train and resort of the Nobility and Gentry, that there was not left a fifth part of the House of Peers at <HI>Westminster;</HI> and truly I do not be∣lieve, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that there was near a Moiety of the House of Commons who con∣tinued there; yet his Majesty made no other use, for the present, of their presence with Him, and of their absence from the two Houses, than to have so many the more, and the more credible Witnesses of his Coun∣sels and Carriage; and to undeceive the People by his clear Answers to all the Scandals and Reproaches which were laid on him, and by his ample professions and protestations of his sincere Zeal to Religion, and Justice; and to make it appear to them, how far the Quality and the Number of those who thought, or seem'd to think otherwise, was, from what they might imagine it to be. And it cannot be denied, but the People were <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> every day visibly reformed in their understandings, from the supersti∣tious reverence they had paid the two Houses; and grew sensible of their duty to the King, and of those Invasions which were offer'd to his Regal dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="503" REF="5210"/>
ON the other side, the two Houses slacken'd not their pace a jot, pro∣ceeded with great and unusual sharpness against those Members who were gone to the King; Proclaiming some of them by Name <Q>“”to be Enemies to the Kingdom, and, by a Formal Judgment, sentencing Nine Peers together, "to be incapable of sitting again in Parliament, whilst This should continue:</Q> The House of Commons having carried up an Impeachment of Misdemeanours against them (which was as il∣legal in point of Justice, and as extravagant in point of Priviledge, as any thing they could do) <Q>“”for being absent, and refusing to attend, upon a <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Summons from the House of Peers:</Q> And upon their own Members they imposed a fine of 100' a piece, on every one who was gone to the King, and upon those, who being in other places, they thought were well affected to his Service: Yet, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they should upon this proceeding return again, to disturb, and cross their Counsels, they provided, <Q>“”that no Man upon whom that Sentence fell, should sit again in the House (tho' he paid his fine) till he had been examined by a Committee, and so given the House satisfaction in the cause of his absence.</Q> And, by those means, they thought both to remove the Scandal, that so many Mem∣bers were absent, and to prevent any inconvenience too, that might be∣fall <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> them by their return. For they well knew, if the Members of both Houses were obliged to a constant and strict Attendance, it would not be possible that they could compass their mischievous Designs.</P>
<P>THEN they prosecuted their great Business of the Militia, not only near <HI>London,</HI> where they were in no danger of opposition, but in those Northern Counties near his Majesty, as <HI>Leicester-shire, Cheshire, Lin∣coln-shire,</HI> where whosoever refused to give obedience to them, or pub∣lished the King's Proclamation against their proceedings (for the King had yet practiced no Expedient to prevent the growth of that mischief, but the publishing his Proclamation against it) were sent for as Delin∣quents; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and not satisfied herewith, that they might be as well able to Pay an Army, as they found they should be to Raise one, on the tenth of <HI>June</HI> (for the time will be very necessary to be remember'd, that it may be the better stated, Who took up the Defensive Armes) they published Propositions <Q>“”for the bringing in of Money or Plate to main∣tain<NOTE PLACE="marg">Propositions, and Orders of both Houses for bringing in Money and Plate for maintaining Horse &amp;c. <HI>June 10. 1642</HI></NOTE> Horse, Horse-men, and Armes, for the preservation of the Publick Peace, and for the defence of the King, and both Houses of Parliament; the Reasons and Grounds whereof they declared to be the King's Inten∣tion to make War against his Parliament: That, under pretence of a Guard for his Person, he had actually begun to levy Forces, both of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Horse and Foot; and sent out Summons throughout the County of <HI>York,</HI> for the calling together of greater Numbers; and some ill affected Persons, in other parts, had been imployed to raise Troops, under the colour of his Majesty's Service; making large offers of reward and pre∣ferment to such as would come in: That his Majesty did, with a high and forcible hand, protect, and keep away Delinquents, not permitting them to make their appearance to Answer such Affronts and Injuries, as had been by them offer'd to the Parliament; and those Messengers, which had been sent from the Houses for them, had been abused, beaten, and imprisoned, so as the Orders of Parliament, the highest Court of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Justice in the Realm, were not obeyed; and the Authority of it was alltogether scorned, and vilified; and such Persons as stood well affected to it, and declared themselves sensible of those publick Calamities, and of the violations of the Priviledges of Parliament, and common Liberty
<PB N="504" REF="5220"/>
of the Subject, were baffled, and injured by several sorts of Malignant Men, who were about the King; some whereof, under the name of Cavaliers, without having respect to the Laws of the Land, or any fear either of God or Man, were ready to commit all manner of Out∣rage and Violence; which must needs tend to the dissolution of the Go∣vernment; the destruction of their Religion, Laws, Liberties, Pro∣perties; all which would be exposed to the Malice and Violence of such desperate Persons, as must be imployed in so horrid and unnatural an Act, as the overthrowing a Parliament by Force; which was the sup∣port, and preservation of them. Those Particulars, they said, being <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> duly considered by the Lords and Commons, and how great an obli∣gation lay upon them, in Honour, Conscience, and Duty, according to the high Trust reposed in them to use all possible means, in such cases, to prevent so great and irrecoverable Evils, they had thought fit to publish their sense, and apprehension of that Imminent danger; there∣by to excite all well affected Persons, to contribute their best assistance, according to their solemn Vow and Protestation, to the Preparations necessary for the opposing, and suppressing of the Trayterous Attempts of those wicked, and malignant Counsellors, who sought to engage the King in so dangerous and destructive an enterprise, and the whole King∣dom <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> in a Civil War; and destroy the Priviledges and Being of Par∣liaments.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”THIS recourse to the good affections of those, that tender their Re∣ligion and just Liberties, and the enjoyment of the blessed fruits of this present Parliament, which were allmost ready to be reaped, and were now as ready to be ruin'd by those wicked hands, being, they said, the only remedy left them under God; and without which they were no longer able to preserve Themselves, or Those by whom they were en∣trusted: Therefore, they declared that whosoever would bring in any proportion of ready Money or Plate, or would underwrite to furnish <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and maintain any number of Horse, Horse-men, and Armes, for the preservation of the Publick Peace, and for the defence of the King, and both Houses of Parliament, from Force and Violence, and to uphold the Power and Priviledges of Parliament according to his Protestation; it should be held a good and acceptable Service to the Common-wealth, and a Testimony of his good affection to the Protestant Religion, the Laws, Liberties, and Peace of the Kingdom; and to the Parliament, and Priviledges thereof. And they further declared, that whosoever brought in Money or Plate, or furnished and maintained Horse, Horse-men, and Armes, upon these Propositions, and to those Purposes, should <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> be repaid their Money with interest of eight <HI>per Cent;</HI> for which they did engage the publick Faith, and they appointed the Guild-Hall in <HI>London</HI> for the place whither this Money, or Plate, should be brought; and four Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> to be their Treasurers for the receiving the same; and likewise other Confiding Men to receive, and prize such Horses and Armes, as should be brought in for their Service. And lastly, for their better encouragement, the Members of both Houses appointed a solemn day to set down their own Subscriptions; which they performed liberally.</Q></P>
<P>MOST of those, who abhorred their impious Designs, not thinking <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> it Lawful for them to be present at such Consultations, withdrew before the day came, or absented themselves Then. But many had the courage to be present, and stoutly to refuse what they thought they could not
<PB N="505" REF="5230"/>
honestly consent to. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Killigrew,</HI> who was a remarkable Enemy to all their devices, being called upon, told them, <Q>“”if there were occa∣sion, he would provide a good Horse, and a good Sword; and made no question but he should find a good Cause.</Q> But, within very few days, both He, and all those who were taken notice of for refusing, found it safest for them to leave the Town; there being very visibly great ani∣mosity against them both within, and without the Walls. And a Gen∣tleman of good Quality assured me afterwards, that, within few days after he had refused to Subscribe, he was privately advised by one of the other Faction, who yet retained some kindness to him, <Q>“”to leave the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Town,</Q> left his Brains were beaten out by the Boys in the Streets. And many of those, who too impotently desired not to be looked upon as Refr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctory Persons, and had pleased themselves with Subscribing more Articulately for the defence of the King's Person, found it afterwards necessary to supply whatsoever they had Subscribed, to be imployed that way as was Declared to be for the defence of the King's Person, what∣soever their Intention was at first, or their Opinion after. And it is hardly credible, what a vast proportion of Plate was brought in to their Treasurers within ten days; there being hardly Men enough to receive <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> it, or room to lay it in; and the Throng being so great of the Bringers, that, in two days attendance, many could not be discharged of their Se∣ditious Offerings. And, the very next day after these Propositions, they further ordered, <Q>“”that there should be a strict search and examination made, by the Justices of Peace, Mayors, Bayliffs, and Constables, near all the Northern Roads, for the seising all Horses for service in the Wars, or great Saddles, that should be carried towards the North parts of <HI>England,</HI> without the Privity or Direction of one or both Houses of Parliament;</Q> which was a great improvement of their former Or∣der, which extended only to Armes and Ammunition; tho', the truth <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> is, the Dexterity and Spirit of their Ministers, who knew their Mean∣ing, made the former allmost as inconvenient and dangerous to Passen∣gers, as the latter.</P>
<P>IT was by many impatiently wonder'd at Then, and, no doubt, will be more censured Hereafter, that, notwithstanding all these invasions, and breaches upon the Regal Power, and all these vast Preparations to destroy him, the King, hitherto, put not himself into a posture of safety; or provided for the resistance of that Power, which threatn'd him; and which, he could not but know, Intended whatsoever it hath since Done; And tho' they had not yet form'd an Army, and chosen a General, yet, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> he well knew, they had Materials abundantly ready for the first, and particular, digested resolutions, in the second; which they could reduce to publick Acts, whensoever they pleased. It is very true he did know all this, and the unspeakable hazards he run, in not preparing against it. But the hazards, which presented themselves unto him on the other side, were not less Prodigious: He had a very great appearance of the Nobi∣lity; and not only of those, who had from the beginning walked, and governed themselves by the Rules the Law prescribed, and, in that re∣spect, were unblamable to King and People: But of Others who had passionately and peevishly (to say no worse) concurred in all the most <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> violent Votes and Actions, which had been done from the beginning: For besides the Lord <HI>Spencer</HI> (who had been chosen their Lieutenant of <HI>Northampton▪shire,</HI> but was recovered to a right understanding, of which he was very capable, by his Uncle the Earl of <HI>Southampton)</HI> the Lord
<PB N="506" REF="5240"/>
<HI>Paget</HI> likewise, who had contributed all his Faculties to Their service, and to the prejudice of the King's, from before the beginning of the Par∣liament; had been one of their Teizers to broach those bold high Over∣tures soberer Men were not, at first, willing to be seen in; and had been, as a Man most worthy to be Confided in, chosen Lord Lieutenant of one of the most Confiding Counties, the County of <HI>Buckingham</HI> (where he had, with great Solemnity and Pomp, executed their Ordinance, in defiance of the King's Proclamation) and had Subscribed a greater num∣ber of Horses for their Service, upon their Propositions, than any other of the same Quality; convinced in his conscience, fled from them, and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> besought the King's Pardon: And, for the better manifesting the tender∣ness of his Compunction, and the horrour he had of his former Guilt, he frankly discovered whatsoever he had known of their Counsels; and aggravated all the ill they had done, with declaring it to be done to worse and more horrid Ends, than many good Men believed to be possible for them to propose to themselves.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING, this glorious Convention was rather an Or∣nament to his Court, than any great Advantage to his Counsels; and the use of them more to discredit the small remainder at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and that the People might see the number and quality of the Dissenters, than <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> that they contrived any thing to the active improvement of his affairs; every Man thinking it high merit in him, that he absented himself from the Company and Place, where all the mischief was done; and that the keeping himself Negatively innocent, was as much as he owed his King and Country. I am willing to impute it to the drowsy and unactive Genius of the Kingdom (contracted by long ease, and quiet) which so much abhorred the thoughts of a Civil War, that it thought a lively and vigorous preparation against it, was to invite it; and there were very few of all the great Lords, who did attend upon the King, who did not declare, <Q>“”that the Parliament durst not in truth (whatever shews they <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> made in hope to shake his Majesty's constancy) make a War; and if they should attempt it, the People would unanimously rise for the King, who would be most safe by not intending his own safety. Where∣as, if he raised Forces, the Parliament would procure themselves to be believed, that it was to overthrow Religion, and suppress the Laws, and Liberties of the People.</Q> They who were of another opinion, and could have spoken more reason, held it not safe to express themselves but in the King's own Ear; there being in the great Council of the Peers, who, for state, were frequently Assembled, and by whom in truth the King then desired to have transacted all things of Moment, some who <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> were not good Counsel-Keepers, and others who were looked upon, and believed to be Spies upon the rest. But that which made the thought of raising Forces (whatever Arguments there were for it) absolutely un∣reasonable, was, that the King had no possibility to procure either Armes, or Munition, but from <HI>Holland;</HI> from whence he daily expected sup∣ply: And till that arrived, let his Provocations and Sufferings be what they could be, he was to submit and bear it patiently.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, for a ground of further proceeding upon occasion, the King desired the Peers in Council, to set down in writing the Affronts, and Violence, which had been offer'd to them at <HI>London,</HI> by which <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> their Presence in the great Council of the Kingdom was rendr'd both unsafe, and dishonourable; the which they the more willingly conde∣scended to, for that the <HI>London</HI> Pamphlets allready aspersed them, as
<PB N="507" REF="5250"/>
Deserters of the Parliament, and Betrayers of the Liberty of their Coun∣try: An Instrument being drawn up, and agreed upon between them▪ in which they set down <Q>“”the Tumults, and the Violence offer'd to particu∣lar Persons in those Tumults; the Threats and Menaces of the Rabble, at the doors of the House, when they had a mind any Exorbitant thing should pass; the Breach and Violation of the old Orders, and Rules of Parliament, whilst Matters were in debate, and the resuming Matters again in a thin House; and reversing, waving, or contradicting Resolu∣tions made in a full House: And, lastly, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hollis</HI>'s coming to the Bar, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and demanding the Names of those Lords who refused to consent to the Militia, when the multitude without, menaced and threaten'd all those Dissenters: after which, they said, "they conceived, they could not be present there, with Honour, Freedom, or Safety; and therefore forbore to be any more present; and so all those Votes, Conclusions, and Decla∣rations had passed, which had begot those Distractions throughout the Kingdom.</Q> And this they delivered to the King, signed under their Hands. And yet (which is a sufficient Instance how unendued Men were with that Spirit and Courage, which was requisite) the next day after the delivery, many Lords came to his Majesty, <Q>and besought him <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> “”that he would by no means publish that Paper, but keep it in his own hands; some of them saying, "that, if it were published, they would disavow it:</Q> so that material and weighty Evidence, which Then might have been of Soveraign use to the King, was render'd utterly ineffectual to his Service; his Majesty finding it necessary to engage his Princely word to them, "never to make it publick without Their consent; which he performed most punctually; and so, to this day, it was never di∣vulged.</P>
<P>To make some little amends for this want of mettle (for it proceeded from nothing else, They being most shy in subscribing, and most passio∣nate <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> against publishing, who were of unquestionable Affection to his Majesty, and integrity to his Cause) and that the world might see, there was a Combination among good Men, to assist his Majesty in the defence of the Law, as well as there was Against both by others: Upon the King's declaring himself fully in Council, where all the Peers were pre∣sent, <Q>“”that, as He would not require or exact any obedience from them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty's Declaration to the Lords attending him at <HI>York, June 13. 1642.</HI></NOTE> but what should be warranted by the known Law of the Land; so he did expect that They would not yield to any Commands not legally grounded, or imposed by any other: That he would defend every one of them, and all such as should refuse any such Commands, whether <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> they proceeded from Votes, and Orders of both Houses, or any other way, from all dangers and hazards whatsoever. That his Majesty would defend the true Protestant Religion, established by the Law of the Land; the Lawful Liberties of the Subjects of <HI>England;</HI> and just Priviledges of all the Three Estates of Parliament; and would require no further obedience from them, than as accordingly he should per∣form the same: And his Majesty did further declare, that he would not, as was falsely pretended, engage them, or any of them, in any War against the Parliament; except it were for his necessary defence and safety, against such as did insolently invade or attempt against his <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Majesty,</Q> or such as should adhere to his Majesty: All the Peers en∣gaged themselves, <Q>“”not to obey any Orders, or Commands whatsoever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The promise of the Lords and others there∣upon.</NOTE> not warranted by the known Laws of the Land; and to defend his Majesty's Person, Crown and Dignity, together with his Just and Legal

<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty's Declaration thereupon.</NOTE> <Q>“”THAT tho' he had, in the last seven Months, met with so many se∣veral encounters of strange and unusual Declarations, under the Name of both his Houses of Parliament, that he should not be amazed at any new Prodigy of that kind; and tho' their last of the 26<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>May</HI> gave him a fair warning that, the Contrivers of it having spent all their stock of bitter and reproachful Language upon him, he was now to expect they should break out into some bold, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sloyal Actions against him: And, having by that Declaration, as far as in them lay, devested his Majesty of that Praeeminence and Authority, which God, the Law, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the Custom and Consent of this Nation had placed in him, and assumed it to Themselves, that they should likewise, with expedition, put forth the fruits of that Supreme Power, for the violating, and suppressing the other which they despised (an effect of which resolution, he said, their Declaration against his Proclamation concerning the pretended Ordinance for the Militia, and their punishing of the Proclaimers ap∣peared to be) yet, he must confess, in their last Attempt (he said, he spoke of the last he knew; they might probably since, or at that pre∣sent, have out done That too) they had out done what his Majesty had conceived was their present intention. And whosoever heard of Pro∣positions, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and Orders, for the bringing in of Money or Plate to main∣tain Horse, and Horse▪men, and Armes, for the preservation of the Publick Peace, or for the Defence of the King and both Houses of Par∣liament (such was their Declaration, or what they please to call it, of the tenth of <HI>June)</HI> would surely believe the Peace of the Kingdom to be extremely shaken; and, at least, the King himself to be consulted with, and privy to those Propositions. But, he said, he hoped, that when his good Subjects should find, that that goodly Pretence of de∣fending the King, was but a specious bait to seduce weak, and incon∣siderate Men into the highest Acts of disobedience and disloyalty against <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty, and of violence and destruction upon the Laws and Con∣stitutions of the Kingdom, they would no longer be captivated by an implicit reverence to the Name of both Houses of Parliament; but would carefully examine, and consider what Number of Persons were present; and What persons were prevalent in those Consultations; and how the Debates were probably managed, from whence such hor∣rid and monstrous Conclusions did result; and would at least weigh the Reputation, Wisdom, and Affection of those, who were notoriously known out of the very horrour of their Proceedings to have with∣drawn themselves; or, by their skill and violence to be driven from <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Them, and their Counsels.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, whilst their Fears and Jealousies did arise, or were infused into the People, from discourses of the Rebels in <HI>Ireland,</HI> of Skippers at <HI>Roterdam,</HI> of Forces from <HI>Denmark, France,</HI> or <HI>Spain</HI> (how improbable and ridiculous soever that bundle of Information appear'd to all wise, and knowing Men) it was no wonder if the easi∣ness to deceive, and the willingness to be deceived, did prevail over many of his weak Subjects to believe, that the dangers, which they did not see, might proceed from causes which they did not understand: But for them to declare to all the world, that his Majesty intended to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> make War against his Parliament (wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lst he sat still complaining to God Allmighty of the injury offer'd to Him, and to the very Being of Parliaments) and that he had allready begun actually to levy Forces both of Horse and Foot (whilst he had only, in a legal way, provided a
<PB N="510" REF="5280"/>
smaller Guard for the security of his own Person so near a Rebellion at <HI>Hull,</HI> than They had, without Lawful Authority, above these eight Months, upon imaginary and impossible dangers) to impose upon his Peoples Sense, as well as their Understanding, by telling them his Ma∣jesty was doing that which they saw he was not doing, and intending that, they all knew, as much as Intentions could be known, he was not intending, was a boldness agreeable to no power but the Omnipo∣tency of those Votes, whose absolute Supremacy had allmost brought confusion upon the King and People; and against which no knowledge in matter of Fact, or Consent and Authority in matter of Law, they <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> would endure should be opposed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HIS Majesty said, he had, upon all occasions, with all possible ex∣pressions, professed his firm and unshaken resolutions for Peace. And, he said, he did again, in the presence of Allmighty God, his Maker and Redeemer, assure the world, that he had no more thought of making War against his Parliament, than against his own Children: That he would observe, and maintain the Acts assented to by him this Parlia∣ment without violation; of which, That for the frequent Assembling of Parliaments was one: And that he had not, nor would have, any thought of using any Force; unless he should be driven to it, for the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> security of his Person, and for the defence of the Religion, Laws, and Liberty of the Kingdom, and the just Rights and Priviledges of Par∣liament: And therefore he hoped the Malignant Party, who had so much despised his Person, and usurped his Office, should not, by their specious fraudulent in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inuations, prevail with his good Subjects to give credit to their wicked Assertions; and so to contribute their Power, and Assistance for the ruin and destruction of Themselves, and his Ma∣jesty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Guard about his Person (which, he said, not so much their Example, as their Provocation had enforced him to take) it was known <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> it consisted of the prime Gentry, in fortune and reputation, of that Country; and of One Regiment of Train'd-bands; who had been so far from offering any Affronts, Injuries, or Disturbance to any of his good Subjects, that their principal End was to prevent such; and so, might be Security, could be no Grievance to his People. That some ill affected Persons, or any Persons, had been imployed in other parts to raise Troops, under colour of his Majesty's Service; or that such had made large, or any, offers of reward, and preferment to such as would come in, which had been alledged by them, was, he said, for ought he knew, or believed, an untruth devised by the Contrivers of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that false Rumour. His Majesty disavowed it, and said he was con∣fident there would be no need of any such Art, or Industry, to induce his loving Subjects, when they should see his Majesty oppressed, and their Liberties and Laws confounded (and till Then he would not call on them) to come in to him,</Q> and to assist him.</P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Delinquents, whom his Majesty was said with a high and forcible hand to protect▪ he wished they might be named, and their De∣linquency: And if his Majesty gave not satisfaction to Justice, when he should have received satisfaction concerning S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> by his Legal Trial, Then let him be blamed. But if the design were, as <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> it was well known to be, after his Majesty had been driven by force from his City of <HI>London,</HI> and kept by force from his Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> to protect all those who were Delinquents against him, and to make
<PB N="511" REF="5290"/>
all those Delinquents who attended on him, or executed his Lawful Commands, he said, he had great reason to be satisfyed in the truth and justice of such Accusation, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to be his Majesty's Servant, and to be a Delinquent grew to be Terms so convertible, that, in a short time, he were left as naked in Attendance, as they would have him in Power; and so compel him to be waited upon only by such whom They should appoint, and allow; and in whose presence he should be more misera∣bly alone, than in desolation it self. And if the seditious Contrivers and Fomenters of that Scandal upon his Majesty, should have as they <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> had had, the power to mislead the Major part present of either or both Houses to make such Orders, and send such Messages and Messengers, as they had lately done, for the apprehension of the great Earls and Barons of <HI>England,</HI> as if they were Rogues or Felons; and whereby Persons of Honour and Quality were made Delinquents, meerly for attending upon his Majesty and upon his Summons; whilst other Men were forbid to come near him, tho' obliged by the duty of their Place and Oaths, upon his Lawful Commands: It was no wonder if Such Messengers were not very well intreated; and Such Orders not well obeyed; neither could there be a surer, or a cunninger way found out <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to render the Authority of both Houses scorn'd and vilified, than to assume to themselves (meerly upon the Authority of the Name of Par∣liament) a Power monstrous to all understandings; and to do Actions, and to make Orders, evidently and demonstrably contrary to all known Law, and Reason (as to take up Armes against his Majesty under co∣lour of defending him; to cause Money to be brought in to Them, and to forbid his own Money to be paid to his Majesty, or to his use, under colour that he would imploy it ill; to beat him, and starve him for his own Good, and by His Power and Authority) which would in short time make the greatest Court, and greatest Person, cheap and of no <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> estimation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”WHO those sensible Men were of the publick Calamities, of the vio∣lations of the Priviledges of Parliament, and the Common Liberty of the Subject, who had been baffled, and injured by Malignant Men, and Cavaliers about his Majesty, his Majesty said, he could not imagine. And if those Cavaliers were so much without the fear of God and Man, and so ready to commit all manner of outrage and violence, as was pretended, his Majesty's Government ought to be the more esteem'd, which had kept them from doing so; insomuch as he believed, no Per∣son had cause to complain of any injury, or of any damage, in the least <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> degree, by any Man about his Majesty, or who had offer'd his Service to him. All which being, he said, duly consider'd, if the Contrivers of those Propositions and Orders had been truly sensible of the obli∣gations, which lay upon them in Honour, Conscience and Duty, ac∣cording to the high Trust reposed in them by his Majesty, and his Peo∣ple, they would not have published such a sense and apprehension of Imminent danger, when themselves, in their Consciences, knew that the greatest, and indeed only danger, which threaten'd the Church and State, the blessed Religion and Liberty of his People, was in their own desperate and seditious Designs; and would not have endeavoured, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> upon such weak and groundless reasons, to seduce his good Subjects from their Affection and Loyalty to him, to run themselves into Actions unwarrantable, and destructive to the Peace and Foundation of the Common-wealth.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="512" REF="5300"/>
<Q>“”AND that all his loving Subjects might see, how causless and ground∣less that scandalous Rumour, and Imputation of his Majesty's raising War upon his Parliament, was, he had, with that his Declaration, caused to be printed the Testimony of those Lords, and other Persons of his Council, who were there with him; who, being upon the place, could not but discover such his Intentions and Preparations; and could not be suspected for their Honours and Interests to combine in such mischievous,</Q> and horrid resolutions.</P>
<P><Q>“”AND therefore, his Majesty said, he streightly charged and com∣manded all his loving Subjects, upon their Allegiance, and as they <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> would Answer the contrary at their Perils, that they should yield no obedience, or consent to the said Propositions and Orders; and that they presume not under any such Pretences, or by colour of any such Orders, to raise or levy any Horse or Men, or to bring in any Money or Plate to such purpose. But, he said, if notwithstanding that clear Declaration, and Evidence of his intentions, those Men (whose de∣sign it was to compel his Majesty to raise War upon his Parliament; which all their skill and malice should never be able to effect) should think fit, by those Alarms, to awaken him to a more necessary care of the defence of Himself, and his People; and should Themselves, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> under colour of Defence, in so unheard of a manner provide (and se∣duce others to do so too) to Offend his Majesty, having given him so lively a Testimony of their Affections, what they were willing to do, when they should once have made themselves Able; all his good Sub∣jects would think it necessary for his Majesty, to look to Himself. And he did therefore excite all his well affected People, according to their Oaths of Allegiance, and Supremacy, and according to their solemn Vow, and Protestation (whereby they were obliged to defend his Per∣son, Honour, and Estate) to contribute their best Assistance to the Preparations necessary for the opposing, and suppressing of the Tray∣terous <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Attempts of such wicked and malignant Persons; who would destroy his Person, Honour, and Estate, and engage the whole King∣dom in a Civil War, to satisfy their own lawless Fury and Ambition; and so rob his good Subjects of the blessed fruit of this present Parlia∣ment; which they allready in some degree had, and might still reap, to the abundant satisfaction and joy of the whole Kingdom, if such wicked hands were not ready to ruin all their possessions, and frustrate all their hopes. And, in that case, his Majesty declared, that whoso∣ever, of what Degree or Quality soever, should then, upon so urgent and visible necessity of His, and such apparent distraction of the King∣dom, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> caused, and begotten by the malice and contrivance of that Ma∣lignant Party, bring in to his Majesty, and to his use, ready Money, or Plate; or should underwrite to furnish any Number of Horse, Horse-men, and Armes, for the preservation of the Publick Peace and defence of his Person, and the vindication of the Priviledge and Freedom of Parliament, he would receive it as a most acceptable Service, and as a Testimony of his singular Affection to the Protestant Religion, the Laws, Liberties, and Peace of the Kingdom; and would no longer de∣sire the continuance of that Affection, than he would be ready to justify, and maintain the other with the hazard of his life.</Q> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>AND so concluded with the same Overtures They had done, in their Propositions for the Loane of Money at interest; <Q>“”offering, for the se∣curity thereof, an Assurance of such his Lands, Forrests, Parks, and
<PB N="513" REF="5310"/>
Houses, as should be sufficient for the same; a more real security, he said, than the Name of publick Faith, given without him, and against him; as if his Majesty were not part of the Publick; And besides, he would allways look upon it as a service most affectionately, and sea∣sonably performed for the preservation of his Majesty, and the King∣dom. But, he said, he should be much gladder that their submission to those his Commands, and their desisting from any such Attempt of raising Horse or Men, might ease all his good Subjects of that charge, trouble,</Q> and vexation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> IT will be wonder'd at hereafter, when, by what hath been said, the Number and Quality of the Peers is consider'd, who, by absenting them∣selves from the House, and their resort to his Majesty, sufficiently de∣clared, that they liked not those Conclusions which begot those Distra∣ctions; why both those Peers and likewise such Members of the Com∣mons, who then, and afterwards appeared in the King's Service, and were indeed full, or very near one Moiety of that House, did not ra∣ther, by their diligent and faithful Attendance in the Houses, according to their several Trusts reposed in them, discountenance and resist those pernicious and fatal transactions, than, by withdrawing themselves from <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> their proper Stations, leave the other (whose ruinous Intentions were sufficiently discover▪d) possessed of the Reputation, Authority, and Power of a Parliament; by which, it was evident, the People would be easily, to a great degree, seduced. And tho' the observing Reader may, upon the collection of the several passages here set down, be able to answer those objections to himself; I am the rather induced, in this place, to apply my self to the clearing that Point, because not only many honest Men, who, at a distance, have consider'd it, without being Privy to the passages within the walls, and those breaches which fatally destroyed, and took away the Liberty and Freedom of those Councils, have been <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> really troubled or unsatisfied with that Desertion, as they call it, of the Service to which they were incumbent, and chosen; but that I have heard some, who were the chief, if not the sole Promoters of those Vio∣lations, and the most violent Designs, and have since (out of the Ruptures, which have proceeded from their own Animosities) either been, or been thought to be, more moderately inclined, complain, <Q>“”that the withdraw∣ing of so many Members from the two Houses, was the Principal Cause of all Calamities.</Q> And they who have been the true Authors of them, and still continue the same men, have taken pains to make, and declare the others <Q>“”Deserters of their Country, and betrayers of <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> their Trusts, by their Voluntary withdrawing themselves from that Council.</Q></P>
<P>IN the doing whereof, I shall not, I cannot, make any excuse for those (of whom somewhat is before spoken) who, from the beginning of this Parliament, and in the whole progress of it, either out of lazi∣ness, or negligence, or incogitancy, or weariness, sorbore to give their attendance there, when the Number of those wo really intended these prodigious Alterations was very inconsiderable; and daily drew many to their opinions, upon no other ground than that the Number of the Dissenters appeared not equally diligent, and intent upon their Asser∣tations: <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Neither can I excuse the Peers, the moderate Part whereof being Four for One, suffer'd themselves to be cousen'd, and perswaded, and threaten'd out of their Rights by a handful of Men, whom they might, in the beginning, easily have crushed; whereas in the House of Commons
<PB N="514" REF="5320"/>
the great Managers were Men of notable parts, much reputation, ad∣mirable dexterity; Pretenders to severe justice, and regularity; and then the Number of the weak, and the wilful, who naturally were to be guided by them, allways made up a Major part; so that, from the beginning, they were allways able to carry whatsoever they set their hearts visibly upon; at least, to discredit, or disgrace any particular Man against whom they thought necessary to proceed, albeit of the most unblemished reputation, and upon the most frivolous suggestions; so that they could not but be very formidable, in that House, to all but the most abstracted Men from all vulgar considerations. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>BUT, I am confident, whosoever diligently resolves the several pas∣sages in both Houses, from the time of the publishing the first Remon∣strance▪ upon his Majesty's Return from <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the time of which we last speak, must be of opinion, that the resorting of so many Mem∣bers Then to his Majesty ▪from whom all the Lords, and some of the Commons, received Commands to that purpose) or to such places, where they thought they might be of greatest use to his Majesty in preserva∣tion of the Peace of the Kingdom, was not only an Act of Duty, but of such Prudence and Discretion, as sober and honest Men were to be guided by. In the House of Peers, the Bishops, who had as much Right to sit <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> there, and were as much Members of Parliament as any Lord there, were first, by direct violence and force, a great part of them, driven and kept from thence, till the Bill, for the Total expulsion of the whole Or∣der from those seats, was passed; such of the Peers, who were most re∣markable for adhering to the Government of the Church, being, in the mean time, threaten'd publickly by the Rabble; and some of their Per∣sons Assaulted. The business of the Militia had been twice, upon solemn debate in a full House, rejected there; till such force and violence was brought to the very doors, such expostulations and threats delivered within the doors against those, who refused to concur with them in that <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> business, that no Man had reason to believe his life out of danger from those rude hands, who was taken notice of for an Opposer of their un∣reasonable desires; some of them having been declared Enemies to their Country, for having refused what was in their power lawfully to re∣fuse; and others having been Criminally accused by the Commons, for Words spoken by them in Debates of the House of Peers; after which many of them were sent for, by special Letters, to attend his Majesty (which Letters were allways thought to be a good, and warrantable, and sufficient ground to be absent from the House; nor had such Sum∣mons, from the beginning of Parliaments to this present, ever been <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> neglected) with whom they had not been many weeks, but two of them, as hath been mention'd before, upon an untrue and extravagant infor∣mation, without further examination, were declared Enemies to the Kingdom; and nine others by solemn judgment, upon an Impeachment brought up by the Commons against them, only for being absent, and for what only concern'd the Priviledge and Jurisdiction of the Peers, were disabled to sit in the House again during this Session; so that, if they would have returned, they were actually excluded that Council.</P>
<P>IN the House of Commons, the case was worse: First, they who had, with that Liberty which is essential to Parliaments, and according to <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> their understandings, dissented or declared a dislike of what the Violent Party so vehemently pursued, were, as hath been said before, declared Enemies to their Country; and their Names posted up in Paper, or
<PB N="515" REF="5330"/>
Parchment, at most eminent places, under some opprobrious Character; which, tho' it was not avowed, and had no Authority from the House by any publick Act, yet, being complain'd of, was neither redressed, nor was the complaint so countenanced, that it could be concluded the Vio∣lation was unacceptable: so, tho' the Tumults were not directly sum∣mon'd or assembled, it is evident, by what hath been before set forth truly and at large, that they found there visible countenance, and en∣couragement.</P>
<P>THEN, what had been, upon full and solemn Debates in a full House, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> rejected, was many times, in a thin House, and at unusual and unpar∣liamentary Hours, resumed, and determined contrary to the former Conclusions: Yet Men satisfied themselves with doing what they thought their Duty, and reasonably opposing what the Major part order'd to be done; hoping that Men's understandings would be shortly better in∣form'd; and that tho' high and irreverent Expressions, and Words were sometimes used against the King, there would be abstaining from un∣lawful and dangerous Actions; and that the House of Peers, at least, would never be brought to joyn, or concur in any Act prejudicial to the Soveraign power. But when they saw a new way found out by the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> dexterity of the Major part in the House of Commons, to make the Mi∣nor part of the Lords too hard for the Major; and so, whilst all Men were transported with jealousy of the breach of Priviledge of Parliament by the King, that there was, by the Houses Themselves, an absolute rooting up of all Priviledges: That from Metaphysical considerations, what <HI>might</HI> be done in case of necessity, the Militia of the Kingdom was Actually seised on; and put under a Command contrary to, and against the King's Command▪ That there was then a Resolution taken by those (who could Act their Resolutions when they pleased) to make a General, and to oblige all the Members to live and dye with that Ge¦neral; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> which will be anon more particularly mention'd (for that Reso∣lution was well known before the time, that those many Members re∣moved to <HI>York,</HI> and withdrew to other places; and was executed within three or four days after) Men thought it high time to look to their in∣nocence, and (since by the Course and Orders of that House, they could leave no monument or evidence of their dissenting, as the Lords might, by their Protestations upon any unlawful Act, or Resolution) to declare their dislike of what was Done, by not being present at the Doing: And it was reasonably thought, there being no other way peaceably and se∣curely to do it, that the Kingdom, understanding the Number of those <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that were present at such new transactions, and weighing the Quality, Number, and Reputation of those who were absent, would be best in∣duced to pefer the old Laws of the Kingdom, before the new Votes (destructive to those Laws) of those few Men, who called themselves the two Houses of Parliament; and that it would prove a good Expe∣dient to work upon the consciences, and modesty of those who stayed behind, to conclude it necessary, by some fair Addresses to his Majesty, to endeavour such a general good understanding, that a perfect union might be made; and the Priviledge, Dignity, and Security of Parlia∣ment, be established according to the true, and just Constitution of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> IT is true, how reasonably soever it might be expected, it produced not that Ingenuity; but they who had been troubled with the company of them that afterwards withdrew, and, by the opposition they made, could not make that expedition in the mischief they intended, were glad
<PB N="516" REF="5340"/>
they were rid of them; yet, shortly, considering what influence indeed it might have upon understanding Men, they found a way to cast a re∣proach upon those who were absent, and yet to prevent any inconve∣nience to themselves by their return; publishing an Order, <Q>“”that all the Members absent should appear at such a day, under the Penalty of paying each 100' fine for his absence; and whosoever did not ap∣pear at that day (which gave not time enough to any who were at a distance) "should not presume to sit in the House, before he had paid his fine,</Q> and satisfied the House with the cause of his absence; So that all those who were with the King, and very many more, who had really <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> withdrawn themselves to refresh their minds, or upon necessary affairs of their own, with a purpose to return, clearly discern▪d themselves ex∣cluded from sitting any more there; it being sufficiently manifest, that the Cause of their absence would never be approved, if their Persons were disliked, and their Opinions disapproved: Which appeared quickly; for the day was no sooner past, but they, without the least warrant of Precedent or colour of Right, expelled very many, sometimes twenty a day, not only of those who were with the King, but of others who had given them equal distast; and order'd new Writs to issue out to choose other Members in their Rooms. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>IT cannot be denied but some very honest and intire Men stayed still there, and opposed all their unjustifiable proceedings with great courage, and much liberty of Speech; which was more frankly permitted to them than had been before, when the Number of the Dissenters was greater; and it may be there are still some who satisfy themselves that they have performed their Duty, by allways having denied to give their consent to whatsoever hath been seditiously, or illegally concluded. But I must Appeal to the consciences of those very Men, whether they have not been many times, by staying there, compelled or terrified to do, and submit to many Acts contrary to their Conscience, in cases of Conscience; <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and contrary to their Judgment and Knowledge, in matters of Law, and Right; and contrary to their Oaths and Duties, in matters of Alle∣giance; and whether if they had refused so to do, they should not have been plunder'd, expelled, and committed to Prison? And then They cannot be thought to have proceeded unreasonably, who, to peserve their Innocence, and their Liberty, chose to undergo all the other Cen∣sures and Difficulties, which could befall them, and which have been since plentifully poured upon them. But to return.</P>
<P>THE King had, at this time, called to him some Judges, and Lawyers of eminency; by whose Advice he published a Declaration concerning <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the Militia, and asserted <Q>“”the Right of the Crown in granting Commis∣sions of Array,</Q> for the better ordering and governing thereof; and, at the same time, issued out those Commissions to all Counties, <Q>“”expressly forbidding any obedience to be given to the Ordinance for the Militia by both Houses,</Q> under the penalty of High Treason. This only im∣proved the Paper-combate in Declarations; either Party insisting, <Q>“”that the Law was on Their side;</Q> and the People giving obedience to either, according to their conveniences: And many did believe, that if the King had resorted to the old known way of Lord Lieutenants, and Deputy Lieutenants, his service would have been better carried on; the Com∣mission <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of Array being a thing they had not before heard of, tho' founded upon an Ancient Act of Parliament in the Reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. and so was received with jealousy, and easily discredited by the glosses and sug∣gestions of the Houses.</P>
<P><PB N="517" REF="5350"/>
BESIDES that some Men of very good Affections to the Crown, and averse enough to the extravagant pretences and proceedings of the Par∣liament, did not conceal their prejudice to the Commission of Array, as not warranted by Law; which did very much work upon other Men, and made the obedience less chearful that was given to that service. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Selden</HI> had, in the Debate upon that Subject in the House of Commons, declared himself very positively, and with much sharpness▪ against the Commission of Array, as a thing expressly without any Authority of Law; the Statute upon which it was grounded being, as he said, re∣pealed; <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> and discoursed very much of the ill Consequences, which might result from submitting to it: He answer'd the Arguments which had been used to support it; and easily prevailed with the House not to like a proceeding, which they knew was intended to do them hurt, and to lessen their Authority, But his Authority and Reputation prevailed much further than the House, and begot a prejudice against it in many well affected Men without doors: When the King was inform'd of it, he was much troubled, having looked upon M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Selden</HI> as well disposed to his Service, And the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> with his Majesty's leave, writ a friendly Letter to M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Selden,</HI> <Q>“”to know his reason, why, in such a <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> conjuncture, whatever his opinion were, he would oppose the submis∣sion to the Commission of Array, which no body could deny to have had it's original from Law, and which many Learned Men still be∣lieved to be very Legal, to make way for the establishment of an Ordi∣nance,</Q> which had no manner of pretence to Right. He Answer'd this Letter very frankly; as a Man who believed himself in the right upon the Commission of Array, and that the Arguments he had used against it could not be Answer'd; summing up some of those Arguments in as few words as they could be comprehended in: But then he did as frankly inveigh against the Ordinance for the Militia, <Q>“”which, he said, was with∣out <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> any shadow of Law or pretence of Precedent, and most destructive to the Government of the Kingdom: And he did acknowledge, that he had been the more inclined to make that discourse in the House against the Commission, that he might with the more freedom argue against the Ordinance; which was to be consider'd upon a day then ap∣pointed: And he was most confident, that he should likewise over∣throw the Ordinance; which, he confessed, could be less supported; and he did believe, that it would be much better, if both were re∣jected,</Q> than if either of them should stand, and remain uncontrolled. But his confidence deceived him; and he quickly found, that They who <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> suffer'd themselves to be intirely govern'd by his Reason, when those Conclusions resulted from it, which contributed to their own designs, would not be at all guided by it, or submit to it, when it perswaded that which contradicted, and would disappoint those designs: And so, upon the day appointed for the debate of their Ordinance, when he applied all his faculties to the convincing them of the illegality and monstrous∣ness of it, by arguments at least as clear and demonstrable as his former had been, they made no impression upon them; but were easily answer'd by those, who with most Passion insisted upon their own sense. He had satisfied them very well, when he concurred with them in judgment; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> but his Reasons were weak, when they crossed their Resolutions. So most Men are deceived in being too reasonable; concluding that Reason will prevail upon those Men to submit to what is Right and Just, who have no other consideration of Right or Justice, but as it advances their In∣terest,
<PB N="518" REF="5360"/>

<P>THESE Paper-skirmishes left neither side better inclined to the other; but, by sharpning each other, drew the matter nearer to an issue. The King had written a Letter to the Mayor and Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> and to the Masters and Wardens of each Company; by which, <Q>“”he assured them, of his desire of the Peace of the Kingdom; and therefore required them, as they tender'd their Charter of the City, and their own par∣ticular Welfares, not to bring in Horses, Money, or Plate, upon the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Propositions of the Houses; whereby, under pretence of raising a Guard for the Parliament, Forces would be levyed, and, in truth, imployed against his Majesty:</Q> Of which the Houses taking notice, published a<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Decla∣ration to the Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon a Letter from the King to the L Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, and Alder∣men.</NOTE> Declaration to the City, <Q>“”That they could not be secured by his Ma∣jesty's Protestations, that his desires and purposes were for the Publick Peace; since it appeared, by divers expressions, and proceedings of his Majesty, that he intended to use Force against those, who submitted to the Ordinance of the Militia; and that he had likewise some intention of making an Attempt upon <HI>Hull.</HI> In both which cases, they did de∣clare, that whatsoever Violence should be used, either against those <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> who exercise the Militia, or against <HI>Hull,</HI> They could not but believe it as done against the Parliament. They told them that the dangerous, and mischievous intentions of some about his Majesty were such, that whatsoever was most precious to Men of Conscience and Honour, as Religion, Liberty, and Publick Safety, were like to be overwhelmed and lost in the general confusion and calamity of the Kingdom; which would not only question, but overthrow the Charter of the City of <HI>London;</HI> expose the Citizens, their Wives and Children, to violence and villany; and leave the Wealth of that famous City as a Prey to those desperate, and necessitous Persons: And therefore they forbid all <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the Officers to publish that Paper, as they would answer their Con∣tempt to the Parliament; by the Power and Authority of which, they assured them, they should be protected, and secured in their Persons, Liberties, and Estates, for whatsoever they should do by Their advice or perswasion.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Reply.</NOTE> TO this the King replied, <Q>“”That he wonder'd since they had usurped the supreme Power to themselves, they had not taken upon them the supreme Style too; and directed their very new Declaration to their Trusty and Well-beloved, their Subjects of the City of <HI>London:</HI> For it was too great and palpable a Scorn, to perswade them to take up <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Armes against his Person, under Colour of being loving Subjects to his Office; and to destroy his Person, that they might preserve the King: That he was beholding to them, that they had explain'd to all his good Subjects the meaning of their Charge against his Majesty, that by his intention of making War against his Parliament, no more was pre∣tended to be meant, but his resolution not to submit to the high In∣justice and Indignity of the Ordinance for the Militia, and the business of <HI>Hull.</HI> He said, he had never concealed his intentions in either of those Particulars (he wished They would deal as clearly with Him) but had allways, and did now declare, That that pretended Ordinance was <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> against the Law of the Land; against the Liberty and Property of the Subject; destructive to Soveraignty; and therefore not consistent with the very Constitution and Essence of the Kingdom, and the Right
<PB N="519" REF="5370"/>
and Priviledge of Parliament: That he was bound by his Oath (and all his Subjects were bound by theirs of Allegiance, and Supremacy, and their own Protestation lately taken, to assist his Majesty) to oppose that Ordinance, which was put allready in execution against him, not only by Training and Arming his Subjects, but by forcibly removing the Magazine, from the place trusted by the County, to their own Houses, and guarding it there with Arm'd Men: Whither it would be next removed,</Q> and how used by such Persons, he knew not.</P>
<P><Q>“”THAT the keeping his Majesty out of <HI>Hull</HI> by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> was an Act of High-Treason against his Majesty; and the taking away his Magazine and Munition from him, was an Act of Violence upon his Majesty, by what hands or by whose direction soever it was done: And, in both cases, by the help of God, and the Law, his Majesty said, he would have Justice, or lose his Life in the requiring it; the which he did not value at that rate, as to preserve it with the Infamy of suf∣fering himself to be robbed, and spoiled of that Dignity he was born to. And if it were possible for his good Subjects to believe, that such a Defence of himself, with the utmost power and strength he could raise, was making a War against his Parliament, he did not doubt, how∣ever <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> it should please God to dispose of him in that contention, but the justice of his Cause would, at the last, prevail against those few Ma∣lignant Spirits, who, for their own ends and ambitious designs, had so misled and corrupted the understandings of his People. And since nei∣ther his own Declaration, nor the Testimony of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o many of his Lords, then with his Majesty, could procure credit with those Men, but that they proceeded to levy Horse, and to raise Money and Armes against his Majesty, he said, he was not to be blamed, if after so many gra∣cious expostulations with them upon undeniable principles of Law and Reason (which they answer'd only by Voting that which his Ma∣jesty <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> said, to be neither Law, nor Reason; and so proceeded actually to levy War upon his Majesty, to justify that which could not be other∣wise defended) at last he made such provision, that as he had been driven from <HI>London,</HI> and kept from <HI>Hull,</HI> he might not be surprised at <HI>York;</HI> but be in a condition to resist, and bring to justice those Men, who would perswade his People that their Religion was in danger, be∣cause his Majesty would not consent it should be in Their power to alter it by their Votes; or their Liberty in danger, because he would allow no Judge of that Liberty, but the known Law of the Land: Yet, he said, whatever provision he should be compelled to make for his security, he would be ready to lay down, assoon as they should re∣voke <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> the Orders by which they had made Levies, and submitted those Persons, who had detain'd his Towns, carried away his Armes, and put the Militia in execution contrary to his Proclamation, to that Trial of their innocence, which the Law had directed, and to which they were born: If that were not submitted to, he should, with a good conscience, proceed against those who should presume to exercise that pretended Ordinance for the Militia, and the other who should keep his Town of <HI>Hull</HI> from him, as he would resi7s;t Persons who came to take away his Life,</Q> or his Crown from him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> <Q>“”AND therefore his Majesty again remember'd, and required his City of <HI>London</HI> to obey his former Commands, and not to be misled by the Oration of those Men, who were made desperate by their Fortunes, or their Fortunes by Them; who told them their Religion, Liberty, and
<PB N="520" REF="5380"/>
Property, was to be preserved no other way, but by their Disloyalty to his Majesty: That they were now at the brink of the River, and might draw their Swords (which was an expression used at a great convention of the City) when nothing pursued them but their own evil consciences. He wished them to consider, whether their Estates came to them, and were settled upon them, by Orders of both Houses, or by that Law which his Majesty defended: What security they could have to enjoy their own, when they had helped to rob his Majesty; and what an happy conclusion That War was like to have, which was raised to oppress their Soveraign: That the wealth and glory of their <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> City was not like to be destroyed any other way, but by Rebelling against his Majesty; and that way inevitably it must; nor their Wives and Children to be exposed to violence and villany, but by those who make their Appetite and Will the measure, and guide to all their Actions. He advised them not to fancy to themselves Melancholy apprehensions, which were capable of no satisfaction; but seriously to consider what security they could have, that they had not under his Majesty, or had been offer'd by him: And whether the Doctrine those Men taught, and would have them defend, did not destroy the Foun∣dations upon which their security was built?</Q> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>THE great conflux that hath been mention'd, of Men of all Condi∣tions, and Qualities, and Humours, could not continue long together at <HI>York,</HI> without some impatience and commotion; and most Men won∣der'd, that there appear'd no provisions to be made towards a War, which they saw would be inevitable: And when the Levies of Soldiers under the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> were hasten'd with so much vigour, that the King should have no other Preparations towards an Army, than a single Troop of Guards made up of Gentlemen Volunteers; who, all Men foresaw, would quit the Troop when there should be an Army: And many do yet believe, that the King too long deferr'd his recourse to Armes; and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that if he had raised Forces upon his first repulse at <HI>Hull,</HI> his service would have been very much advanced; and that the Parliament would not have been able to have drawn an Army together. And so Men still reproach the Councils which were then about the King, as they were censured by many at that time; but neither They then, nor These now do understand the true reason thereof. The King had not, at that time, one Barrel of Powder, nor one Musquet, nor any other provision ne∣cessary for an Army; and, which was worse, was not sure of any Port, to which they might be securely assign'd; nor had he Money for the support of his own Table for the term of one Month. He expected, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> with impatience, the arrival of all those necessaries, by the care and activity of the Queen; who was then in <HI>Holland,</HI> and by the sale of her own, as well as of the Crown Jewels, and by the friendship of <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> did all she could to provide all that was necessary; and the King had newly directed her to send all to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which was but then secured to him by the diligence of the Earl of that Name. In the mean time both the King Himself, and they who best knew the state of his Affairs, seem'd to be without any thoughts of making War; and to hope, that the Parliament would at last incline to some Accom∣modation; for which both his Majesty, and those Persons were exposed <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> to a thousand reproaches.</P>
<P>THE Queen had many difficulties to contend with; for tho' the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had a very signal affection for the King's Service, and did all
<PB N="521" REF="5390"/>
he could to dispose the States to concern themselves in his Majesty's Quarrel; yet his Authority, and Interest, was much diminished with the vigour of his Body and Mind: And the States of <HI>Holland</HI> were so far from being inclined to the King, that they did him all the mischief they could. They had before assisted the Rebellion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with giving them credit for Armes and Ammunition, before they had money to buy any; and they did afterwards, several ways, discover their affections to the Parliament; which had so many Spies there, that the Queen could do nothing they had not present notice of; so that it was no easy mat∣ter <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> for the Queen to provide Armes and Ammunition, but the Parlia∣ment had present notice of it, and of the ways which were thought upon to Transport them to the King: And then their Fleet, under the Com∣mand of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> lay ready to obstruct and intercept that Communication; nor was any remedy in view to remove this mischief; insomuch as it was no easy thing for the King to send to, or to receive Letters from, the Queen.</P>
<P>THERE was a small Ship of 28 or 30 Guns, that was part of the Fleet that wafted her Majesty into <HI>Holland</HI> from <HI>Dover,</HI> which was called the Providence, under the Command of Captain <HI>Straughan,</HI> when <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the Fleet was Commanded by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington,</HI> and before the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was superinduced into that Charge against the King's Will. That Ship, the Captain whereof was known to be faithful to his Majesty, was, by the Queen, detain'd, and kept in <HI>Holland</HI> from the time of her Majesty's Arrival, under several pretences, of which the Captain made use, when he afterwards received Orders from the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> <Q>“”to repair to the Fleet in the <HI>Downs;</HI></Q> until, after many promises and excuses, it was at last discern'd, that he had other Business and Com∣mands; and so was watched, by the other Ships, as an Enemy. This Vessel the Queen resolved to send to the King, principally to inform his Ma∣jesty <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of the streights she was in; of the provisions she had made; and to return with such particular Advice, and Directions from his Majesty, that she might take further resolutions: And because the Vessel was light, and drew not much Water, and so could run into any Creek, or open Road, or Harbour, and, from thence, easily send an express to the King; there was put into it about two hunder'd Barrels of Powder, and two or three thousand Armes with seven or eight Field-Pieces; which, they knew, would be very welcome to the King, and serve for a beginning and countenance to draw Forces together. The Captain was no sooner put to Sea, but notice was sent to the Commander of the Fleet in the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> <HI>Downs;</HI> who immediately sent three or four Ships to the North, which easily got the Providence in View, before it could reach that Coast; and chased it with all their Sails, till they saw it enter into the River of <HI>Humber;</HI> when, looking upon it as their own, they made less hast to follow it, being content to drive it before them into their own Port of <HI>Hull;</HI> there being, as they thought, no other way to escape them; un∣til they plainly saw the Ship entring into a narrow Creek out of <HI>Humber,</HI> which declined <HI>Hull,</HI> and lead into the Country some Miles above it; which was a place well known to the Captain, and design'd by him to arrive at from the beginning. It was in vain for them then to hasten <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> their pursuit; for they quickly found that their great Ships could not enter into that passage, and that the River was too shallow to follow him; and so, with shame and anger, they gave over the Chase; whilst the Captain continued his course; and having never thought of saving
<PB N="522" REF="5400"/>
the Ship, run it on Shoar on that side towards <HI>Burlington;</HI> and, with all expedition, gave notice to the King of his arrival; who, immediately, caused the Persons of Quality, in the parts adjacent, to draw the Train'd bands of the Country together, to secure the incursions from <HI>Hull;</HI> and by this means, the Armes, Ammunition, and Artillery, were quickly brought to <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>THE King was well content that it should be generally believed, that this small Ship, the size whereof was known to few, had brought a greater quantity and proportion of Provisions for the War, than in truth <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> it had; and therefore, tho' it had brought no Money, which he expected, he forthwith granted Commissions, to raise Regiments of Horse and Foot, to such Persons of Quality and Interest, as were able to comply with their obligations. He declared the Earl of <HI>Lindsey,</HI> Lord High Chamberlain of <HI>England,</HI> his General of the Army; a Person of great Honour and Courage, and generally beloved; who many years before had good Commands in <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and had been Admiral at Sea in several Expeditions. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Jacob Ashley</HI> was declared Major Ge∣neral of the Foot, a Command he was very equal to, and had exercised before, and executed after, with great approbation. The Generalship of the Horse, his Majesty preserved for his Nephew Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> who was dayly expected, and arrived soon after: And all Levies were hasten'd with as much expedition as was possible in so great a scarcity, and notorious want of Money; of which no more need be said, after it is remember'd that all the Lords, and Council about the King, with several other Persons of Quality, voluntarily made a Subscription for the payment of so many Horse for three Months; in which time they would needs believe, that the War should be at an end; every one pay∣ing down what the three Months pay would amount to, into the hands of a Treasurer appointed to receive it; and this Money was presently paid for the making those Levies of Horse, which were design'd; and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> which could not have been made but by those Moneys.</P>
<P>AND now the King thought it time to execute a Resolution he had long intended, and which many Men wonder'd he neglected so long; which was, as much as in Him lay, to take the Admiralty into his own hands. He had long too much cause to be unsatisfied, and displeased with the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> whom, he thought, he had obliged above any Man whatsoever. His delivering the Fleet into the hands and Command of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> after his Majesty had expressly re∣fused it to the Parliament, the King could not easily forgive; however he thought it not Then seasonable to resent it, because he had nothing <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to object against him, but his complyance with the Command of the Par∣liament, who would have own'd it as their own quarrel; and must have obliged that Earl to put his whole Interest into Their hands, and to have run Their Fortune; to which he was naturally too much inclined: And then his Majesty foresaw, that there would have been no Fleet at all set out that year, by their having the Command of all the Money, which was to be applied to that Service. Whereas, by his Majesty's concealing his resentment, there was a good Fleet made ready, and set out; and many Gentlemen settled in the Command of Ships, of whose Affection and Fidelity his Majesty was assured, that no Superior Officer <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> could corrupt it; but that they would, at all times, repair to his Service, when ever he required it. And, indeed, his Majesty had an opinion of the devotion of the whole body of the Common Sea-men to his Service,
<PB N="523" REF="5410"/>
because he had, bountifully, so much mended their condition, and in∣creased their Pay, that he thought they would have even thrown the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> over Board, when he should Command them; and so the respiting the doing of it would be of little importance. But now, that a Ship of his own, in the execution of his Commands, should be chased by his own Fleet as an Enemy, made such a noise in all places, even to his reproach and dishonour, that he could no longer defer the doing what he had so long thought of. He resolved therefore, to revoke the Earl of <HI>Northumberlands</HI> Commission of the Office of High-Admi∣ral <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of <HI>England,</HI> and to send the Revocation to him under the Great Seal of <HI>England:</HI> Then, to send S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington,</HI> who was then at <HI>York,</HI> on board the Fleet, and to take the Charge of it: and Letters were pre∣pared, and sign'd by the King, to every one of the Captains; whereby they were required, "to observe the Orders of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington.</HI> And all this was carried with all possible Secrecy, that none, but those few who were trusted, knew, or suspected any such Alteration.</P>
<P>BUT the King thought fit, first to advise with S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington;</HI> of whose Integrity he was confident, and whose judgment he allways principally relied on in all his Maritime Actions; and thought him the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> only Person fit immediately to take the Fleet out of the Earl of <HI>War∣wicks</HI> possession; who had dispossessed Him of the Command that year, which he had usually exercised. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington,</HI> finding the mat∣ter full of difficulty, and the execution like to meet with some inter∣ruptions, expressed no alacrity to undertake it in his own Person; alledg∣ing, <Q>“”that himself stood in the Parliaments disfavour, and jealousy (which was true) and that therefore his motion, and journey toward the <HI>Downs,</HI> where the Fleet then lay, would be immediately taken notice of; and his Majesty's Design be so much guessed at, that there would need no other Discovery;</Q> but he propounded to his Majesty, <Q>“”that he <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> would send a Letter to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Mansel,</HI> who lived at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> speedily to go to the Fleet, and to take charge of it, and that His Au∣thority, being Vice-Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> and his known and great Re∣putation with the Sea-men, would be like to meet with the least re∣sistance.</Q> His Majesty, imparting this Counsel to those whom he had made Privy to his purpose, enter'd upon new considerations; and con∣cluded, <Q>“”that S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Robert Mansel</HI>'s age (tho' his Courage and Integrity were unquestionable) and the accidents that depended upon that, would render that Expedient most hazardous; and that, in truth, there needed no such absolute and supreme Officer, to be appointed in the first Ar∣ticle; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> but rather, that his Majesty should direct his special Letter to the Captain of every Ship, requiring him immediately to weigh An∣chor, and to bring away his Ship to such a place as his Majesty might appoint, where he should receive further Orders: And to that place he might send such an Officer, as he thought fit to trust with the Com∣mand of the whole Navy so assembled.</Q> According to this Resolution, the whole Dispatch was prepared. First a Revocation of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s Commission of Admiral, under the Great Seal of <HI>England;</HI> of which there was a Duplicate; the one to be sent to his Lordship; the other to the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> whose Commission was <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> founded upon, and so determined by, the other. Then a particular Letter to each of the Captains of his Ships, informing them <Q>“”of his Majesty's Revocation of the Admiral's Patent, and, consequently, of the determination of the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s Commission (to whom his
<PB N="524" REF="5420"/>
Majesty likewise writ,</Q> to <Q>“”inhibit him from further medling in that Charge)</Q> and therefore commanding them to yield no further obedience to either of their Orders; but that, immediately upon the receipt of those his Royal Letters, he should weigh Anchor; and with what speed he might, repair to <HI>Burlington</HI>▪Bay upon the Coast of <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> where he should receive his Majesty's further pleasure: And so each Com∣mander, without relation to any other Commands, had no more to look after but his own Ship, and his own Duty; by which the King might expect, at least, so many Ships as were under the Command of those who had any Affection or Fidelity to his Service. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, all things being prepared, and signed by the King and sealed, what immediately concern'd the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was delivered to one of his Majesty's Pages, to be given to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> at <HI>London;</HI> and the whole dispatch to the Fleet to M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Edward Villiers,</HI> whose diligence and dexterity his Majesty found fit for any Trust; the former being directed <Q>“”not to make such hast, but that the other might be at least assoon at the <HI>Downs,</HI></Q> as He at <HI>London;</HI> and M<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>Villiers</HI> again being appointed what Letters he should first de∣liver to the Captains; <Q>“”and that he should Visit the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> in the last place;</Q> that his Activity might have no influence upon the Sea-men <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to prevent their obedience to his Majesty. And surely if this re∣solution had been pursued, it is very probable, that the King had been Master of very many of his Ships again. But, when the Messengers were dispatched, and well instructed, and he that was for <HI>London</HI> gone on his Journey, there was a suddain and unexpected change of the whole direction to the Fleet, by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington</HI>'s repair to his Majesty; and, upon second thoughts, offering <Q>“”to go Himself to the <HI>Downs,</HI> and to take Charge of the Fleet,</Q> which changed the Forms of the Letters to the several Captains; and, instead of leaving every one to use his best expedition to bring away his own Ship to <HI>Burlington,</HI> <Q>“”required them <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> only to observe such Orders, as they should receive by S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pen∣nington;</HI></Q> who thought not fit (for the reasons formerly given of his being taken notice of) to go with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Villiers;</HI> but, by Him, writ to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Palmer,</HI> to whom likewise his Majesty sent a Letter to that pur∣pose, being an Officer of the Navy, and who lived by the <HI>Downs,</HI> <Q>“”im∣mediately to go aboard the Admiral; and that he Himself would make all possible hast to him, setting out at the same time with M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Villiers;</HI></Q> but Journeying a further and more private way. M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Villiers,</HI> lest, by his stay for the alteration of his dispatches, the Page's coming to <HI>London</HI> sooner than was intended at his setting out, might produce <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> some inconvenience to the service, slept not till he came to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Palmer;</HI> who, being infirm in his health, and surprised with the Com∣mand, could not make that expedition aboard, as might have been re∣quisite; tho' he was Loyally and Zealously affected to his Majesty's Ser∣vice. However, M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Villiers</HI> hasten'd to the Ships which lay then at Anchor, and according to his Instructions, delivered his several Let∣ters to the Captains; the greatest part whereof received them with great expressions of duty and submission, expecting only to receive S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington</HI>'s Orders, for which they stayed; and, without doubt, if either the first Letters had been sent, or S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington</HI> been pre∣sent, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> when these others were delivered, his Majesty had been possessed of the greatest part of the Fleet; the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> being at that time, according to his usual Licences, with some Officers whose com∣pany
<PB N="525" REF="5430"/>
he liked, on shoar making merry; so that there was only his Vice-Admiral, Captain <HI>Batten,</HI> on board; who was of eminent disaffection to his Majesty: The Rear-Admiral, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Mennes,</HI> being of unquestion∣able Integrity.</P>
<P>BUT after five or six hours (in which time nothing could be acted, for want of advice and direction; enough being ready to Obey, but none having Authority to Command) the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> came aboard his Ship, to whom M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Villiers</HI> likewise gave his Majesty's Letters of his Discharge; who, without any Declaration of disobeying it, applied him∣self <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to the confirming those, whom he thought true to his Party, and diligently to watch the rest; presuming, that he should speedily hear from those, by whom he had been originally trusted.</P>
<P>IN the mean time▪ the Captains expected Orders from S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pen∣nington;</HI> who likewise privately expected such an account from S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Palmer,</HI> as might encourage him to come to the Ships. But this unfor∣tunate delay disappointed all: For the other Gentleman, according to his Instructions, having reached <HI>London</HI> in the evening after the Houses were risen, deliver'd the King's Letter, and the Discharge of his Com∣mission,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King re∣vokes the Earl of <HI>Northum∣berland</HI>'s Com∣mission of Ad∣miral.</NOTE> to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland;</HI> who, with all shews of Duty <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and Submission, expressed <Q>“”his resolution to obey his Majesty; and a hearty sorrow, that he had, by any Misfortune, incurr'd his Majesty's displeasure.</Q> How ingenuous soever this demeanour of his Lordships was, the business was quickly known to those, who were more concern'd in it; who were exceedingly perplexed, with the apppehension of being dispossed of so great a part of their strength, as the Royal Fleet; and earnestly pressed the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> <Q>“”that, notwithstanding such his Majesty's Revocation, he would still continue the execution of his Office of Lord High Admiral; in which they would assist him with their utmost and full Power,</Q> and Authority. But his Lordship <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> alledging, <Q>“”that it would ill become Him, who had received that Charge from the King with so notable circumstances of Trust and Favour, to continue the possession thereof against his express Pleasure, there being a Clause in his Grant, that it should be only during such time as his Majesty thought fit to use his Service;</Q> and so <Q>“”utterly refusing to meddle further in it;</Q> assoon as they could get the Houses together the next morning, they easily agreed to pass an Ordinance, as they call it, <Q>“”to appoint the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> to be Admiral of that Fleet, with as full and ample Authority, as he had before had from the Earl of <HI>Northumberland.</HI></Q> Which Ordinance, together with Letters, and Votes <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of encouragement to his Lordship and to the Officers and Sea-men, they speedily sent, by a Member of their own; who arrived therewith, the next morning, after M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Villiers</HI> had delivered the King's Letters; S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington</HI> in the mean time neither coming, nor sending any further Advice.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> being thus arm'd, found himself Master of his Work; and immediately summon'd all the Captains, to attend him on board his Ship in Council; the which all but two did (Captain <HI>Slingsby,</HI> and Captain <HI>Wake)</HI> who, being by his Majesty's Letters, as the rest were, expressly charged to yield no further obedience to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> refused to repair to him; making themselves ready to resist any vio∣lence, and putting their Ships in order to go out to Sea, that they might be at Liberty to attend his Majesty's Commands; but they were so en∣compassed by the whole Fleet, and the dexterity of the Earl's Ministers

was such, and the devotion, generally, of the Sea-men so tainted, and corrupted from the King's Service, that, instead of carrying away the Ships, the Captains themselves were seised, taken, and carried by their own Men to the Earl; who immediately committed them to Custody, and sent them up Prisoners to the Parliament. Then the Earl Commu∣nicated the Ordinance, Letters, and Votes from the two Houses, to the rest of the Officers; of whom only two more refused to continue their Charge against the signification, they had received from the King (S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Mennes,</HI> and Captain <HI>Burly)</HI> who were quickly discharged, and set on shoar; and the rest, without any scruple or hesitation, <Q>“”obliged them∣selves <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> to obey the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI></Q> in the Service of the Parliament; so that the Storm was now over, and the Parliament fully, and intirely possessed of the whole Royal Navy, and Militia by Sea; for they quickly disposed of two other honest Captains, <HI>Kettleby,</HI> and <HI>Stradlin</HI> (whom they could not corrupt) who guarded the Irish Seas; and got those Ships likewise into their Service. And thus his Majesty was without one Ship of his own, in his three Kingdoms, at his Devotion.</P>
<P>AS this loss of the whole Navy was of unspeakable ill consequence to the King's Affairs, and made his condition much the less consider d by his Allies, and Neighbour Princes; who saw the Soveraignty of the Sea <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> now in other hands, that were like to be more imperious upon the ap∣prehension of any discourtesies, than regular and lawful Monarchs use to be; I cannot but observe some unhappy circumstances, and accidents in this important business of the Navy, which looked like the hand of Providence to take that strength, of which his Majesty was most con∣fident, out of his hands. When the resolution of the House of Com∣mons, and the concurrence of the Lords was peremptory, and the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> had declared his complyance with them, <Q>“”for the sending the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> Admiral of that Fleet, in the place of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>John Pennington,</HI></Q> upon whom the King depended; it was resolved <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> likewise by them, "that Captain <HI>Carteret,</HI> Controller of his Majesty's Navy, a Man of great eminency, and reputation in Naval Command, "should be Vice-Admiral; who thinking it became his near relation to his Majesty▪s Service, to receive his Royal pleasure before he engaged himself in any imployment of that Nature, addressed himself for his di∣rections. But the King, looking upon the Fleet in a manner taken from him, when another, whose disaffection to his Service was very notorious, was, contrary to his express pleasure presumptuously put into the Com∣mand of it, and his own Minister displaced for no other reason (his suf∣ficiency, and ability for Command being by all Men confessed) but his <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Zeal and Integrity to Him, would not countenance that Fleet, and that Admiral, with suffering an Officer of his own to Command in it under the other; and therefore order'd Captain <HI>Carteret</HI> to decline the im∣ployment, which he, prudently, and without noise, did; and thereupon, another Officer of the Navy, the Survey or General, Captain <HI>Batten,</HI> a Man of very different inclinations to his Master, and his Service, and furious in the new fancies of Religion, was substituted in the place: Whereas if Captain <HI>Carteret</HI> had been suffer'd to have taken that Charge, His interest and reputation in the Navy was so great, and his diligence and dexterity in Command so eminent, that it was generally believed, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> he would, against whatsoever the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> could have done, have preserved a Major part of the Fleet in their duty to the King. The misfortunes which happen'd after, and are mention'd before, are not in
<PB N="527" REF="5450"/>
justice to be imputed to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington;</HI> who, sure, was a very ho∣nest Gentleman, and of unshaken Faithfulness and Integrity to the King; but to the little time he had to think of it: And the perplexity he was in (besides his true Zeal to the Service) to consider that so great a work, as the recovery of the Royal Navy, was to be done by his own Personal engagement, made him look so little to his own security, that, instead of taking the Fleet from the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> he was Himself taken by the Earl, and sent to the Parliament; where the carrying over the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and some other Jealousies, had left a great arrear of displeasure <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> against him.</P>
<P>THE truth is, the King was so confident upon the general Affections of the Sea-men, who were a Tribe of People more particularly coun∣tenanced and obliged by him, than other Men, his Majesty having en∣creased their allowance, in Provision and Money, above the old establish∣ment of the Navy, as hath been mention'd; that he did believe no Activity of ill Officers could have corrupted them; but that, when the Parliament had set out and victualled the Fleet, it would, upon any oc∣casion, declare it self at his devotion. But, on the other side, they had been taught to believe, that all the King's bounty, and grace towards <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> them, had flowed from the mediation of those Officers, who were now engaged against the King; and that, the Parliament having seised the Customs, and all other the Revenues of the Crown, they had no other hope of Pay or Subsistence, but by absolutely devoting themselves to their Service: so that a greater, or more general defection of any one Order of Men was never known, than that, at this time, of the Sea-men; tho' many Gentlemen, and some few of the Common sort, to their last∣ing Honour and Reputation, either addressed themselves to the Active Service of their Sovereign, or suffer'd Imprisonment, and the loss of all they had, for refusing to serve against him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> THE News of this diminution of his Majesty's power, and terrible addition of strength to his Enemies, was a great allay to the brisk hopes at <HI>York,</HI> upon the arrival of their Ammunition, and wise Men easily discern'd the fatal consequence of it in opposition to the King's most hopeful designs; yet, in a very short time, all visible sense of it so much vanished that (as there was a marvellous alacrity, at that time, in despising all advantages of the Parliament) some Men publickly, and with great confidence, averr'd, <Q>“”that the King was a Gainer by the loss of his Fleet; because he had no Money to pay the Sea-men, or keep them together; and that one Victory at Land, of which there was no <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> doubt, would restore him to his Dominion at Sea, and to whatsoever had been unjustly taken from his Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>THE King found it was now time to do more than write Declara∣tions, when the Parliament was now intirely possessed of the Militia by Sea, and made such a Progress in the attempt to obtain the same at Land, that tho' the People generally (except in great Towns and Cor∣porations, where, besides the natural Malignity, the factious Lecturers, and Emissaries from the Parliament, had poison'd their affections) and especially those of Quality, were Loyally inclin'd; yet, the terrour of the House of Commons was so great, which sent for and grievously pu∣nished <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> those Sheriffs and Mayors, who published, according to their Dutys and express Oaths, his Majesty's Proclamation, and those Mi∣nisters, who, according to his Injunctions, read and divulged his Decla∣rations, that all such, and, indeed, all others eminently affected to the
<PB N="528" REF="5460"/>
King, were forced to fly to <HI>York</HI> for Protection; or to hide themselves in Corners from that Inquisition, which was made for them. And there∣fore his Majesty, in the first place, that he might have one Harbour to resort to in his Kingdom, sent the Earl of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> privately, with a Commission to take the Government of <HI>New-Castle;</HI> who against the little opposition, that was prepared by the Schismatical party in the Town, by his Lordships great Interest in those parts, the ready com∣plyance of the best of the Gentry, and the general good Inclinations of the place, speedily and dextrously assured that most important rich Town, and Harbour to the King; wich, if it had been omitted but very few <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> days, had been seised on by the Parliament; who had then given di∣rection to that purpose. Then for the Protection of the general parts of the Kingdom, and keeping up their affections, his Majesty appointed and sent many of the nobility and prime Gentlemen of the several Counties, who attended him, into their respective Counties to execute the Commission of Aray; making the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> by Com∣mission under the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> (which he was to keep secret in reserve, till he found, either by the growth, or extraordinary practice of the Parliament in raising Forces, that the Commission of Array was not enough) <Q>“”his Lieutenant General of all the Western Parts of the <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Kingdom, with power to Levy such a Body of Horse and Foot, as he found necessary for his Majesty's Service, and the containing the People within the Limits of their Duty.</Q> With the Marquis went the Earl of <HI>Bath</HI> (thought then to be in notable power and interest in <HI>De∣von shire)</HI> the Lord <HI>Pawlet,</HI> the Lord <HI>Seymour,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Berkley,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> and others, very good Officers, to form an Array if it should be found expedient. And so, much of the lustre of the Court being abated, by the remove of so many Persons of Ho∣nour and Quality, the King began to think of encreasing, and forming his Train into a more useful posture, than it was yet; and, without any <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> noise of raising an Army, to make the Scene of his first Action to be the recovery of <HI>Hull</HI> (whither new forces were sent from <HI>London)</HI> by the ordinary Forces and Traind-bands of that County; by colour whereof, he hoped to have such resort, that he should need no other industry to raise such an Army, as should be sufficient to preserve himself from the violence, which threaten'd his safety; and accordingly, that the People might fully understand his Intentions, he summon'd some of the Train'd-bands to attend him at <HI>Beverly,</HI> a Town within four Miles of <HI>Hull;</HI> whi∣ther he removed his Court, and published a Proclamation, briefly con∣taining<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lamation from <HI>Beverly.</HI></NOTE> <Q>“”the Rebellion of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> in holding that Town by a <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Garrison against him; his demanding Justice from the two Houses without effect; the seising his Fleet at Sea; and the hostile Acts of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> upon the Inhabitants of that Town, many of whom he turn'd out of their Habitations; and upon the Neighbour County, by imprison∣ing many, and driving others for fear from their Houses: And therefore that he was resolved to reduce the same by Force; inhibiting all Com∣merce or Traffick with the said Town,</Q> whilst it continued in Rebellion.</P>
<P>WHICH Proclamation he likewise sent to both Houses of Parlia∣ment, with this further signification, <Q>“”that, before he would use force to reduce that place to it's due obedience, he had thought fit, once <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> more, to require them, that it might be forthwith delivered to him; wherein if they should conform themselves, his Majesty would be then willing to admit such Addresses from them, and return such Propositions
<PB N="529" REF="5470"/>
to them, as might be proper to settle the Peace of the Kingdom, and compose the present Distractions. He wished them to do their Duty, and to be assured from Him, on the word of a King, that nothing should be wanting on His part, that might prevent the calamities which threaten'd the Nation, and might render his People truly happy; but if that his gracious Invitation should be declined, God and all good Men must judge between them: And assigned a Day, by which he would expect their Answer at <HI>Beverly.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN the mean time, to encourage the good Affections of <HI>Nottingham∣shire,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> which seem'd almost intirely to be devoted to his Service; and to countenance and give some life to his friends in <HI>Lincoln-shire,</HI> where, in contempt of his Proclamation, the Ordinance of the Militia had been boldly executed by the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> of <HI>Parham,</HI> and some Mem∣bers of the House of Commons, his Majesty took a short Progress to <HI>Newark;</HI> and, after a days stay, from thence to <HI>Lincoln;</HI> and so, by the day appointed, return'd to <HI>Beverly;</HI> having, in both those places, been attended with such an appearance of the Gentlemen, and Men of Quality, and so full a concourse of the People, as one might reasonably have guessed the affections of both those Counties would have seconded <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> any just, and regular service for the King.</P>
<P>THEY at <HI>London</HI> were not less Active; but, upon their success in the business of the Navy, proceeded to make themselves strong enough, at least, to keep what they had; and therefore, having, by their Ordi∣nance of the Militia, many voluntary Companies form'd of Men ac∣cording to their own hearts; and, by their Subscriptions, being supplied with a good stock of Money, and a good number of Horse; before the King's Message from <HI>Beverly</HI> came to them, on the twelfth of <HI>July,</HI> be∣ing the same day the Message went from the King, both Houses Voted, and Declared, <Q>“”That an Army should be forthwith raised for the safety<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Votes of both Houses for raising an Army.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of the King's Person; defence of both Houses of Parliament, and of those, who had obeyed their Orders, and Commands; and preserving of the true Religion, the Laws, Liberty, and Peace of the Kingdom. That the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> should be their General, and that they would live,</Q> and dye with him. And, having put themselves into this posture of Treating, the same day they agreed that a Petition should be framed, <Q>“”to move the King to a good accord with the Parliament, to prevent a Civil War;</Q> the which was purposely then consented to, that the Peo∣ple might believe, the talk of an Army and a General, was only to draw the King to the more reasonable Concessions. And it is certain the first <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> was consented to by many, especially of the House of Peers (in hope the better to compass the other) with the perfect horrour of the thought of a War. Tho' the King's Message came to them before their own was dispatched, yet, without the least notice taken of it, and lest the contents of their Petition might be known before the arrival of their own Mes∣sengers, the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Holland,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Philip Stapleton,</HI> being the Committee appointed for the same, made a speedy and quick Journey for <HI>Beverly;</HI> and arrived, in the same minute that the King came thither from <HI>Lincoln:</HI> So that his Majesty no sooner heard of the raising an Army, and declaring a General against him, but he was en∣counter'd <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> with the Messengers for Peace; who reported to all whom they met, and with whom they conversed, <Q>“”that they had brought so absolute a Submission from the Parliament to the King, that there could be no doubt of a firm and happy Peace:</Q> And when the Earl of
<PB N="530" REF="5480"/>
<HI>Holland</HI> presented the Petition, he first made a short Speech to the King; telling him, <Q>“”that the glorious Motto of his Blessed Father, King <HI>James,</HI> was <HI>Beati Pacifici,</HI> which he hoped his Majesty would continue; that they presented him with the Humble Duty of his two Houses of Par∣liament, who desired nothing from him but his consent, and acceptance of Peace; they aiming at nothing but his Majesty's Honour, and Hap∣piness:</Q> And then read their Message aloud, in these Words:</P>
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ments Pet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion to the King at <HI>Beve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y,</HI> July 15. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>42.</NOTE> To the Kings most excellent Majesty; The humble Petition of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament.</L> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/></Q>
<P>"May it please your Majesty:</P>
<P><Q>“”ALTHO' We, your Majesty's most humble and faithful Subjects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, have been very un∣happy in many former Petitions, and Supplications to your Ma∣jesty; wherein we have represented our most dutiful Affections in advising, and desiring those things, which we held most necessary for the preservation of God's true Religion; your Majesty's Safety, and Honour; and the Peace of the Kingdom: And, with much sor∣row, do perceive that your Majesty, incensed by many false Calum∣nies <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and Slanders, doth continue to raise Forces against Us, and your other peaceable and Loyal Subjects; and to make great prepa∣rations for War, both in the Kingdom, and from beyond the Seas; and, by armes and violence, to over rule the judgment and advice of your Great Council; and by force to determine the Questions there depending, concerning the Government and Liberty of the Kingdom: Yet, such is our earnest desire of discharging our duty to your Majesty and the Kingdom, to preserve the Peace thereof, and to prevent the miseries of Civil War amongst your Subjects; that, notwithstanding we hold our selves bound to use all the means and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> power, which, by the Laws and constitutions of this Kingdom, we are trusted with for defence, and protection thereof, and of the Sub∣jects from force and violence: We do, in this our Humble and Loyal Petition, prostrate our selves at your Majesty's feet; beseeching your Royal Majesty, that you will be pleased to forbear and remove all preparations, and actions of War; particularly the Forces from about <HI>Hull,</HI> from <HI>New-Castle, Tinmouth, Lincoln,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln-shire;</HI> and all other places. And that your Majesty will recal the Commissions of Array, which are Illegal; dismiss Troops, and extraordinary Guards by you raised: That your Majesty will come nearer to your <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> Parliament, and hearken to their faithful Advice and humble Pe∣titions; which shall only tend to the defence, and advancement of Religion; your own Royal Honour, and Safety; and the preserva∣tion of our Laws and Liberties. And we have been, and ever shall be, careful to prevent, and punish all Tumults, and seditious Actions, Speeches, and Writings, which may give your Majesty just cause of distast, or apprehension of danger. From which publick Aimes and Resolutions, no sinister or private respect shall ever make us to decline. That your Majesty will leave Delinquents to the due course of Justice; and that nothing done, or spoken in Parliament, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> or by any Person, in pursuance of the Command and Direction of both Houses of Parliament, be question'd any where but in Par∣liament.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="531" REF="5490"/>
<Q>“”AND We, for Our parts, shall be ready to lay down all those Prepa∣rations, which we have been forced to make for our defence. And for the Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> and the Ordinance concerning the Militia, as we have, in both these Particulars, only sought the preservation of the Peace of the Kingdom, and the defence of the Parliament from force and violence; so We shall most willingly leave the Town of <HI>Hull</HI> in the state it was, before S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> drew any Forces into it; delivering your Majesty's Magazine into the Tower of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and supplying whatsoever hath been disposed by us for the Ser∣vice <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of the Kingdom. We shall be ready to settle the Militia by a Bill, in such a way as shall be honourable, and safe for your Majesty; most agreeable to the Duty of Parliament, and effectual for the Good of the Kingdom; that the strength thereof be not imployed against it self, and that which ought to be for our Security, applied to our Destruction; and that the Parliament, and those who profess, and desire still to preserve the Protestant Religion, both in this Realm, and in <HI>Ireland,</HI> may not be left naked, and indefensible to the mischievous Designs, and cruel Attempts of those, who are the pro∣fessed, and confederated Enemies thereof in your Majesty's Domi∣nions, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> and other neighbour Nations. To which if your Majesty's Courses and Counsels shall from henceforth concur, We doubt not but We shall quickly make it appear to the world, by the most emi∣nent effects of Love and Duty, that your Majesty's Personal Safety, your Royal Honour, and Greatness, are much dearer to us than our own Lives and Fortunes; which We do most heartily dedicate, and shall most willingly imploy for the support,</Q> and maintenance thereof.</P>
<P>ASSOON as this Petition was read by the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> the King told them <Q>“”that the reproaches cast upon him by it, were not an∣swerable <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to the Expressions his Lordship had made; and that he was sorry that they thought the exposing Him, and his Honour to so much scandal, was the way to procure, or preserve the Peace of the King∣dom: That they should speedily receive his Answer; by which the world would easily discern,</Q> Who desired Peace most. And accord∣ingly, the second day, his Majesty delivered them, in publick, his An∣swer to their Petition, which was likewise read by one of his Servants, in these Words:</P>
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesty's Answer.</NOTE> His Majesty's Answer to the Petition of the Lords and Commons <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> assembled in Parliament.</L></Q>
<P><Q>“”THO' his Majesty had no great reason to believe that the directions sent to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> to go to the River <HI>Humber,</HI> with as many Ships as he should think fit, for all possible assistance to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> (whilst his Majesty expected the giving up of the Town unto him) and to carry away such Armes from thence, as his discretion thought fit to spare out of his Majesty's own Magazine: The choosing a General by both Houses of Parliament, for the defence of those who have obeyed their Ordes and Commands, be they never so extrava∣gant, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and illegal: Their Declaration, that, in that case, they would live and dye with the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> their General (all which were Voted the same day with this Petition) And the committing the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> to Prison, for executing his Majesty's Writs, and Lawful
<PB N="532" REF="5500"/>
Commands; were but ill Prologues to a Petition, which might com∣pose the miserable Distractions of the Kingdom; yet his Majesty's pas∣sionate desire of the Peace of the Kingdom, together with the Preface of the Presenters, That they had brought a Petition full of duty and submission to his Majesty; and which desired nothing of him, but his consent to Peace (which his Majesty conceived to be the Language of both Houses too) begot a greedy hope, and expectation in him, that this Petition would have been such an Introduction to Peace, that it would, at least, have satisfied his Message of the eleventh of this Month, by delivering up <HI>Hull</HI> unto his Majesty. But, to his unspeakable grief, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> his Majesty hath too much cause to believe, that the End of some Per∣sons, by this Petition, is not in truth to give any real satisfaction to his Majesty; but, by the specious pretences of making offers to him, to mislead and seduce his People, and lay some imputation upon him of denying what is fit to be granted; otherwise, it would not have thrown those unjust reproaches, and scandals upon his Majesty, for making a necessary and just defence for his own safety; and so peremptorily justi∣fied such Actions against him, as, by no rule of Law of Justice can admit the least colour of defence: And, after so many free and unli∣mited Acts of Grace passed by his Majesty without any condition, have <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> proposed such things which, in justice, cannot be denied unto him, upon such conditions as, in honour, he cannot grant. However, that all the world may see how willing his Majesty would be to embrace any over∣ture, that might beget a right understanding between Him, and his two Houses of Parliament (with whom, he is sure, he shall have no contention, when the private practices, and subtle insinuations of some few Malignant Persons shall be discovered; which his Majesty will take care shall be speedily done) he hath, with great care, weighed the Particulars of this Petition,</Q> and returns this Answer:</P>
<P><Q>“”THAT the Petitioners were never unhappy in their Petitions or <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Supplications to his Majesty, while they desired any thing which was necessary, or convenient for the preservation of God's true Religion; his Majesty's Safety, and Honour; and the Peace of the Kingdom: And therefore, when those general envious Foundations are laid, his Majesty could wish some particular Instances had been applied. Let Envy and Malice object one particular Proposition for the preservation of God's true Religion which his Majesty hath refused to consent to; what Himself hath often made, for the ease of tender Consciences, and for the advancement of the Protestant Religion, is notorious by many of his Messages and Declarations. What regard hath been to <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> his Honour and Safety, when he hath been driven from some of his Houses, and kept from other of his Towns by Force: And what care there hath been of the Peace of the Kingdom, when endeavours have been used to put all his Subjects in Armes against him, is so evident, that, his Majesty is confident, he cannot suffer by those general Impu∣tations. It is enough that the world knows what he hath granted, and what he hath denied.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR his Majesty's raising Forces, and making Preparations for War (whatsoever the Petitioners, by the evil Arts of the Enemies to his Majesty's Person and Government, and by the calumnies, and slan∣ders <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> raised against his Majesty by them, are induced to believe) all Men may know what is done that way, is but in order to his own de∣fence. Let the Petitioners remember, that (which all the world
<PB N="533" REF="5510"/>
knows) his Majesty was driven from his Palace of <HI>White-Hall,</HI> for safety of his Life: That both Houses of Parliament, upon their own Authority, raised a Guard to themselves (having gotten the Com∣mand of all the Traind-bands of <HI>London</HI> to that purpose) without the least colour, or shadow of danger: That they usurped a power, by their pretended Ordinance, against all Principles and Elements of Law, over the whole Militia of the Kingdom, without, and against his Ma∣jesty's consent: That they took possession of his Town, Fort, and Ma∣gazine of <HI>Hull,</HI> and committed the same to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham;</HI> who <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> shut the Gates against his Majesty, and, by Force of Armes, denied entrance thither to his own Person: That they justified this Act which they had not directed; and took S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> into their protection for whatsoever he had done, or should do, against his Majesty. And all this, whilst his Majesty had no other attendance than his own Me∣nial Servants. Upon this, the Duty, and Affection of this County, prompted his Subjects here to provide a small Guard for his own Per∣son; which was no sooner done, but a Vote suddainly passed of his Majesty's intention to levy War against his Parliament (which, God knows, his heart abhorreth) and notwithstanding all his Majesty's Pro∣fessions, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Declarations, and Protestations to the contrary, seconded by the clear Testimony of so great a Number of Peers upon the place, Propositions and Orders for Levies of Men, Horse, and Armes, were sent throughout the Kingdom; Plate and Money brought in, and re∣ceived; Horse and Men raised towards an Army, Mustered, and under Command; and all this contrary to the Law, and to his Majesties Pro∣clamation: And a Declaration published, that if he should use Force for the recovery of <HI>Hull,</HI> or suppressing the pretended Ordi∣nance for the Militia, it should be held levying War against the Par∣liament: And all this done, before his Majesty granted any Commission <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> for the levying, or raising a Man. His Majesty's Ships were taken from him, and committed to the custody of the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> who presumes, under that power, to usurp to himself the Soveraignty of the Sea, to chase, fright, and imprison such of his Majesty's good Subjects, as desire to obey his Lawful Commands; altho' he had notice of the legal Revocation of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s Commission of Admiral,</Q> whereby all power derived from that Commission ceased.</P>
<P><Q>“”LET all the world now judge who begun this War, and upon whose account the miseries, which may follow, must be cast; what his Ma∣jesty could have done less than he hath done; and whether he were <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> not compelled to make provision, both for the defence of himself, and recovery of what is so violently, and injuriously taken from him; and whether these injuries, and indignities, are not just grounds for his Majesty's fears and apprehensions of further mischief, and danger to him. Whence the fears and jealousies of the Petitioners have pro∣ceeded, hath never been discovered; the dangers they have brought upon his Subjects are too evident; what those are they have pre∣vented, no Man knows. And therefore his Majesty cannot but look upon that Charge as the boldest, and the most scandalous, hath been yet laid upon him; That this necessary provision, made for his own <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> safety and defence, is to over rule the Judgment, and Advice of his Great Council; and by force to determine the Questions there de∣pending, concerning the Government and Liberty of the Kingdom. If no other force had been raised to determine those Questions, than
<PB N="534" REF="5520"/>
by his Majesty, this unhappy misunderstanding had not been: And his Majesty no longer desires the blessing, and protection of Allmighty God upon Himself and his Posterity, than He, and They, shall solemnly observe the due execution of the Laws, in the defence of Parliaments, and the just Freedom thereof.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Forces about <HI>Hull,</HI> his Majesty will remove them, when he hath obtain'd the End for which they were brought thither. When <HI>Hull</HI> shall be again reduced to his subjection, he will no longer have an Army before it. And when he shall be assured, that the same Ne∣cessity and pretence of Publick Good, which took <HI>Hull</HI> from him, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> may not put a Garrison into <HI>New-Castle</HI> to keep the same against him, he will remove His from thence, and from <HI>Tinmouth;</HI> till when, the example of <HI>Hull</HI> will not out of his memory.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Commissions of Array, which are legal, and are so proved by a Declaration now in the Press, his Majesty wonders why they should at this time, be thought grievous, and fit to be recalled; if the fears of Invasion and Rebellion be so great, that, by an illegal pre∣tended Ordinance, it is necessary to put his Subjects into a posture of defence, to Array, Train, and Muster them, he knows not why the same should not be done in a regular, known, lawful way. But if, in <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the execution of that Commission, any thing shall be unlawfully im∣posed upon his good Subjects, his Majesty will take all just, and ne∣cessary care for their redress.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR his Majesty's coming nearer to his Parliament, his Majesty hath expressed himself so fully in his several Messages, Answers, and Declarations; and so particularly avowed a real fear of his safety, upon such instances as cannot be Answer▪d, that he hath reason to take himself somewhat neglected, That, since upon so manifest reasons it is not safe for his Majesty to come to them, both his Houses of Par∣liament will not come nearer to his Majesty; or to such a place where <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> the freedom, and dignity of Parliament might be preserved. How∣ever, his Majesty shall be very glad to hear of some such example in their punishing the Tumults (which he knows not how to expect, when they have declared, That they knew not of any Tumults; tho' the House of Peers desired, both for the Freedom and dignity of Par∣liament, that the House of Commons would joyn with them in a De∣claration against Tumults; which they refused, that is, neglected to do and other seditious Actions, Speeches, and Writings, as may take that apprehension of danger from him▪ tho', when he remembers the particular complaints Himself hath made of businesses of that nature, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and that, instead of inquiring out the Authors, neglect of examination hath been, when offer hath been made to both Houses to produce the Authors; as in that Treasonable Paper concerning the Militia: And when he sees every day Pamphlets published against his Crown, and against Monarchy it self; as the Observations upon his late Messages, Declarations, and Expresses; and some Declarations of their own, which give too great encouragement, in that Argument, to ill Affected Persons; his Majesty cannot, with confidence, entertain those Hopes which would be most welcome to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the leaving Delinquents to the due course of Justice, his Ma∣jesty <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> is most assured there hath been no shelter to any such. If the te∣diousness and delay in prosecution, the vast charge in Officer's fees, the keeping Men under a General accusation, without Trial, a whole year
<PB N="535" REF="5530"/>
and more, and so allowing them no way for their defence and vindica∣tion, hath frighten'd Men away from so chargeable and uncertain at∣tendance, the Remedy is best provided, where the Disease grew. If the Law be the measure of Delinquency, none Such are within his Ma∣jesty's Protection: But if by Delinquents such are understood, who are made so by Vote, without any Trespass upon any known, or established Law: If by Delinquents those nine Lords are understood, who are made Delinquents for obeying his Majesty's Summons to come to him, after their stay there was neither safe, nor honourable, by reason of the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Tumults, and other Violences; and whose Impeachment, he is confi∣dent, is the greatest breach of Priviledge, that, before this Parliament, was ever offer'd to the House of Peers: If by Delinquents such are un∣derstood, who refuse to submit to the pretended Ordinance of the Mi∣litia; to that of the Navy; or to any other, which his Majesty hath not consented to; such who for the Peace of the Kingdom, in an hum∣ble manner, prepare Petitions to Him, or to both Houses, as his good Subjects of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI> did; whilst seditious ones, as that of <HI>Essex,</HI> and other places, are allowed, and Cherished: If by Delinquents such are understood, who are called so for publishing his Proclamations, as <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> the Lord Mayor of <HI>London;</HI> or for reading his Messages and Declara∣rations, as divers Ministers about <HI>London</HI> and elsewhere; when those against him are dispersed, with all care and industry, to poyson and cor∣rupt the Loyalty and Affection of his People: If by Delinquents such are understood, who have, or shall lend his Majesty Money, in the Uni∣versities, or in any other places: His Majesty declares to all the world That he will protect Such with his utmost power and strength; and directs, that, in these cases, they submit not to any Messengers, or War∣rant; it being no less his Duty to Protect those who are Innocent, than to bring the Guilty to condign Punishment; of both which the Law is <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to be judge. And if both Houses do think fit to make a General, and to raise an Army for defence of those who obey their Orders, and Com∣mands, his Majesty must not sit still, and suffer such who submit to his just power, and are sollicitous for the Laws of the Land, to perish, and be undone, because they are called Delinquents. And when They shall take upon them to dispense with the attendance of those, who are called by his Majesty's Writ, whilst they send them to Sea, to rob his Majesty of his Ships; or into the several Counties, to put his Subjects in Armes against him; his Majesty (who Only hath it) will not lose the power to dispense with them to attend his own Person; or to execute <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> such Offices, as are necessary for the preservation of Himself, and the Kingdom;</Q> but must protect them, tho' they are called Delinquents.</P>
<P><Q>“”FOR the Manner of the proceeding against Delinquents, his Majesty will proceed against those, who have no Priviledge of Parliament, or in such cases where no Priviledge is to be allowed, as he shall be advised by his Learned Council, and according to the known, and unquestion∣able Rules of the Law; it being unreasonable, that he should be com∣pelled to proceed against those, who have violated the known and un∣doubted Law,</Q> only before Them who have directed such violation.</P>
<P><Q>“”HAVING said thus much to the Particulars of the Petition, tho' his <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Majesty hath reason to complain, that, since the sending this Petition, they have beaten their Drums for Soldiers against him; Arm'd their own General with a power destructive to the Law, and Liberty of the Subjects; and chosen a General of their Horse: His Majesty, out of his

<P><MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> THE whole Court, upon the hearing that Petition from the two Houses read, expressed a marvellous Indignation at the intolerable In∣dignities offer'd to the King by it; and seem'd no better satisfied with the Messengers; who had professed, <Q>“”that they brought an absolute sub∣mission to his Majesty;</Q> when, in truth, what they brought, appeared to be a full Justification of whatsoever they had done before, and an im∣plied Threat of doing worse, and fixing all the scandals upon his Majesty, which they had scatter▪d abroad before: insomuch that all Men expected, and believed his Majesty to be engaged, for the vindication of his Prince∣ly <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> dignity and honour, to return a much sharper Answer to them, than he had ever sent. So that, when this which is before set down (and which had before been consented to, and approved in the full Assembly of the Peers, and Counsellors) was read publickly, it was generally thought, that the King had not enough resented the Insolence, and Usurpation of the Parliament; or appear▪d sensible enough of the Provocations: Yet the thought of a War, which wise Men saw actually levied upon the King already, was so much abhorred, and Men were so credulous of every Expedient which was pretended for Peace, that, by the next morn∣ing (the Answer being deliver'd in the evening) these active Messengers <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> for the Parliament perswaded many <Q>“”that the King's Answer was too sharp, and would provoke the Houses, who were natually passionate, to proceed in the high ways they were in; whereas, if the King would abate that severity of Language, and would yet take off the Preamble of his Answer, they were confident, and the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> privately offer'd to undertake, that satisfaction should be given to all that his Majesty proposed.</Q> And, by this means, some were so far wrought upon, as they earnestly importuned the King, <Q>“”that he would take his Answer, which he had publickly delivered the night before, from the Messen∣gers; and, instead thereof, return only the Matter of his own Proposi∣tions, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> in the most soft and gentle Language; without the Preamble, or any mention of the unjustifiable, and unreasonable demeanour of the Parliament towards him.</Q></P>
<P>BUT his Majesty replied, <Q>“”that he had for a long time, even after
<PB N="538" REF="5560"/>
great provocations, and their first general Remonstrance to the People, treated with all imaginable complyance, and lenity of words with them; and discover'd their unjustifiable and extravagant proceedings with and against him, and the consequences that would inevitably attend their Progress in them, with such tender expressions, as if he be∣lieved whatever was amiss to proceed from misinformation only, and unskilful mistakes: That this gentleness, and regard of his, was so far from operating upon them, that their Insolence, and Irregularities in∣creased; and it might be from that reason, that their Messages and De∣clarations were writ in so high a Dialect, and with that Soveraignty of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Language, as if He were subject to Their jurisdiction; and did not know but it might have some influence upon his People to his disad∣vantage, that is, raise terrour towards Them, and lessen their reverence towards his Majesty, when all Their Petitions and Propositions were more Imperative than His just, and necessary Refusals: Which con∣descension his Majesty had brought himself to, in hope, that His exam∣ple, and Their natural shame, would have reform▪d that new Licence of words: That this last Address, under the name of a Petition (a few days after they had violently ravished his whole Fleet from him; and prepared the same day, that they had chosen a General, to whom they <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> had sworn Alleg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance, to lead an Army against him) contained a perem∣tory Justification of whatsoever they had done; and as peremtory a Threatning of whatsoever they could do: and therefore, if he should Now retract his Answer, which had been solemnly consider'd in Coun∣cil, before all the Peers, and which in truth implied rather a Princely resentment of the Indignities offer'd to him, than flow d with any sharp or bitter Expressions, he should, by such yielding, give encouragement to New attempts; and could not but much discourage those, upon whose Affections and Loyalty he was principally to depend; who could not think it safe to raise themselves to an indignation on his behalf, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> when He expressed so tender, or so little sense of his own sufferings: besides, that he was then upon an avowed Hostile enterprise for the re∣duction of <HI>Hull;</HI> towards which he was to use all possible means to draw a Force together, equal to that Design; and by such a Retraction as this proposed, and a seeming declension of his Spirit, and depending upon their good natures, who had done all this mischief, he should not only be inevitably disappointed of the resort of new strength, but, pro∣bably, deserted by those few, whom he had brought together: That he could not reasonably, or excusably depend upon the undertaking of the Earl of <HI>Holland;</HI> who had so grosly deceived him in other under∣takings, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> which were immediately in his own power to have perform'd: whereas neither he, nor either of the other two Gentlemen, who were joyn▪d with him in this imployment, had so much interest with the Active and Prevailing Party, as to know more of their Intentions than was at present necessary to be discover'd for their Concurrence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”HE said, that he had never yet consented to any one Particular, since the beginning of this Parliament, by which he had received prejudice, at the doing whereof he had not the solemn undertakings and promises of those, who were much abler to justify their undertakings, than the Earl of <HI>Holland;</HI> and upon whom he only depended, that it should be <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> no disservice to him, and would be an infallible means to compass all that his Majesty desired: But he had allways found those Promisers and Undertakers, tho' they could eminently carry on any Counsel, or
<PB N="539" REF="5570"/>
Conclusion, that was against Law, Justice, or His Right, had never power to reduce, or restrain those agitations within any bounds of So∣briety, and moderation: And when they found, that many would not be guided by them, that they might seem still to Lead, themselves as furiously Followed the other; and resorted again to his Majesty with some new Expedient, as destructive as the former. So that he was re∣solved to rely upon God Allmighty, and not so much to depend upon what might possibly prevail upon the Affections of those, from whom, reasonably, he could not expect any good, as upon such plain and avow'd <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> courses, as, let the success be what it would, must, to all judging Men, appear to be prudently, and honourably relied on: And therefore he positively refused to make the least alteration in his Answer.</Q> And so the Messengers departed, leaving the Court and Country worse affected, than they found it; and branding some particular Persons, whom they found less inclined to be ruled by their professions and promises, <Q>“”as the Authors of a Civil War:</Q> And making them as odious as they could, where ever they came.</P>
<P>AND sure, from that time, the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was more transported from his natural temper and gentleness of disposition, into passion and <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> animosity against the King, and his Ministers; and, having been nothing pleased with his own condition at <HI>London,</HI> finding the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> (whom he did not secretly love, and did indeed contemn) to draw all Men's Eyes towards him, and to have the greatest Interest in their hearts, he had seriously intended, under colour of this Message to the King, to discover if there were any sparks yet left in his Royal breast, which might be kindled into affection, or acceptation of his Service; and hoped, if he could get any credit, to redeem his former trespasses: But when he not only found his Majesty cold towards him, but easily enough discern'd, by his reception, that all former inclinations were dead, and more than or∣dinary <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> prejudices grown up towards him in their places, and that his ad∣vices were rejected, he return'd with rancour equal to the most furious he went to; and heartily joyn'd and concurr'd towards the suppressing that Power, in the Administration whereof he was not like to bear any part.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty having, by his Answer, obliged himself not to make any forcible Attempt upon <HI>Hull</HI> till the 27<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>July,</HI> by which time he might reasonably expect an Answer to his Propositions, in the mean time re∣solved to make some short progress into the neighbour Counties; and accordingly, the same day the Messengers departed, the King went to <HI>Doncaster;</HI> the next day to <HI>Nottingham;</HI> and so to <HI>Leicester;</HI> where <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> he heard, the Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> and some other Parliament Men, were executing the Ordinance of the Militia: But, before his Majesty came thither, they removed themselves to <HI>Northampton;</HI> a Town so true to them, as, if they had been purfued, would have shut their Gates against the King Himself, as <HI>Hull</HI> had done.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Leicester</HI> the King was received, with great expressions of Duty and Loyalty, by the appearance of the Traind-bands, and full Acclama∣tions of the People; yet there were two Accidents that Happen'd there, which, if they be at all remember'd, will manifest, that if the King were Loved there as he ought to be, that the Parliament was more Fear'd than <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> He. It happen'd to be at the time of the general Assizes, and Justice <HI>Reeve</HI> (a Man of a good reputation for Learning, and Integrity; and who, in good times, would have been a good Judge) sate there as judge; and M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Hastings,</HI> younger Son to the Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> was purposely
<PB N="540" REF="5580"/>
made high Sheriff, to contain the County within the limits of their duty by the power of that Office, as well as by the Interest, and Relation of his Family. The Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> and his Assistants, had departed the Town but few hours before his Majesty's entrance; and had left their Magazine, which was indeed the Magazine of the County, in a little Store-House at the end of the Town, guarded by some inferior Officers whom they had brought down to Train and Exercise the Militia, and other Zealous and devoted Men of the County, in all to about the Num∣ber of 25, who had barricadoed the door of the House; and professed <Q>“”to keep it against ail demanders;</Q> having provisions within it of all sorts. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> The King was very unwilling (coming in so peaceable a manner, at so peaceable a time) to take any notice of it. On the other hand, it was an Act of too great insolence to be suffer'd; and, upon the matter, to leave a Garrison of the Rebels in possession of the Town; and therefore he sent word to the Judge, <Q>“”that if He took not some legal way to remove such a Force so near his Majesty, his Majesty would do it in some Extraor∣dinary course:</Q> Which, upon the suddain, would have puzled him to have done; having neither Soldier, Cannon, nor Powder to effect it; the want of which as much troubled the Sheriff In the end, the Gentlemen of the Country, who had not yet otherwise declared themselves on either <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> side, than by waiting on his Majesty, finding that the King would not go from the Town, till that Nuisance was removed; and that it might bring Inconveniences, Charge, and Mischief to the County of a high na∣ture; so prevailed, that, as his Majesty was contented to take no notice of it, so they within the House, in the night, upon assurance of Safety, and Liberty to go whither they would, removed and left the House; and so that matter was quieted.</P>
<P>THE other Accident was, or was like to have proved, more Ridicu∣lous: Some of the King's Servants, hearing that the Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> and the other Militia Men were newly gone out of the Town, had of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Themselves, coming thither before the King, galloped after them; in∣tending to have apprehended them, and brought them before the King; and, tho▪ the other were too fleet for them, had, in the way, overtaken D<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Bastwick,</HI> a Man well known, who had been a principal Officer with them at <HI>Leicester,</HI> and fled at the same time, but could not keep pace with his Commanders: Him they brought to the Town, where, by the Sheriff, he was committed to Prison; having confessed enough Treason, and justifying it, as would have justly hanged any Subject. The King thought once to have had him indicted then, at the Assizes, upon the plain Statute of 25 <HI>E.</HI> III. But the Judge besought his Majesty not to put a mat∣ter <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of so great moment, upon which the power of the two Houses of Par∣liament, and a Parliament sitting, must be determin'd, before one single Judge, whose reputation was not enough to bear so great a burthen; how∣ever, he declared his own opinion fully to his Majesty, <Q>“”that it was Trea∣son; which, he believed, all the other Judges must acknowledge; and if convened together by his Majesty to that purpose, he thought a joynt Declaration, and Resolution of all together might be of great use to the King; whereas the publishing of His particular opinion could only de∣stroy himself, and nothing advance his Majesty's Service: Besides, he had no reason to be so confident of the Country, as to conclude that a <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Jury, then suddainly summon'd, would have the courage to find the Bill; and then their Not doing it, if it were attempted, would prove a greater countenance to the Ordinance, than the Votes of the two Houses had
<PB N="541" REF="5590"/>
yet given it.</Q> This last reason gave his Majesty satisfaction; so that he was contented that the fellow should be kept in Prison, and the Tryal be deferred, till he could conveniently summon more Judges to be present.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty was no sooner perswaded to be content that this prose∣cution might be suspended, but the close Agents for the Parliament's Ser∣vice, who were not yet disover'd, but appear'd very intire to the King, so dextrously carried themselves, that they prevailed with those Gen∣tlemen of the Country, whose Zeal to his Majesty was most eminent and unquestionable, and even with the Judge himself, <Q>“”to wish, that his Ma∣jesty <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> would freely and graciously discharge the D<SUP>r</SUP> of his Imprisonment; or give the Judge leave to do so upon a <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI></Q> (which he was advised to require) <Q>“”And that it would be such an Act of Mercy, and singular Justice, that would not only work upon the People of That County to his Majesty's advantage, but must have a great influence upon the whole Kingdom,</Q> and even upon the Parliament it self. And with this strange desire the good Judge, and those principal Gentlemen, confidently came to the King, the night before he intended to return Northward. His Majesty told them, <Q>“”he would think of it till the next morning.</Q> And, in the mean time, concluding by what he heard, that <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> tho' he should refuse to discharge him, or to consent that he should be dis∣charged, his restraint would not be long in that place after His departure, the People allready resorting to him with great License, and the D<SUP>•</SUP>, ac∣cording to his Nature, talking seditiously and loudly, he directed <Q>“”a Mes∣senger of the Chamber very early, with such Assistance as the Sheriff should give him, to carry him away to <HI>Nottingham;</HI> and, by the help of that Sheriff,</Q> to the Goal at <HI>York:</HI> Which was executed accordingly with expedition, and secrecy; if either of which had been absent, it is certain the Common People had rescued him; which, of how trivial a moment soever it shall be thought, I could not but mention as an Instance <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> of the Spirit and Temper of that time, and the great Disadvantage the King was upon, that so many very good Men thought fit, at a time, when very many hundreds of Persons of Honour, and Quality, were impri∣son'd with all strictness and severity by the Parliament, upon the bare suspition that they meant to go to the King, or that they wished well to him, or for not submitting to some illegal Order, or Command of Theirs, that the King should discharge an infamous Person, taken in an Act of High-Treason, and who more frankly, and avowedly professed sedition, than he did the Science of which he pretended to be Doctor.</P>
<P>THE King, according to his appointment, return'd towards <HI>Hull,</HI> in <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> expectation of an Answer from the Parliament; which came two days after the appointed day, but with no solemnity of Messengers, or other ceremony, than inclosed to one of the Secretaries to be presented to the King; in which they told him,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia∣ments Repli∣cation <HI>July26 1642.</HI></NOTE> <Q>“”THAT they could not, for the present, with the discharge of the Trust reposed in them for the safety of the King and Kingdom, yield to those Demands of his Majesty: The reason why they took into their custody the Town of <HI>Hull,</HI> the Magazine, and Navy; passed the Ordi∣nance of the Militia; and made preparation of Armes; was for security of Religion, the safety of his Majesty's Person, of the Kingdom, and Par∣liament; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> all which they did see in evident, and imminent danger; from which when they should be secured, and that the Forces of the King∣dom should not be used to the destruction thereof, they should then be ready to withdraw the Garrison out of <HI>Hull;</HI> to deliver the Magazine
<PB N="542" REF="5600"/>
and Navy; and settle the Militia, by Bill, in such a way as should be ho∣nourable and safe for his Majesty; most agreeable to the duty of Parlia∣ment; and effectual for the good of the Kingdom; as they had pro∣fessed in their late Petition. And for Adjourning the Parliament, they apprehended no reason for his Majesty to require it; nor security for themselves to consent to it. And as for that reason which his Majesty was pleased to express, they doubted not but the Usual place would be as safe for his Royal Person, as any other; considering the full Assurance they had of the Loyalty, and Fidelity of the City of <HI>London</HI> to his Ma∣jesty; and the care which his Parliament would ever have to prevent <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> any danger, which his Majesty might justly apprehend; besides the manifold conveniences to be had there, beyond any other parts of the Kingdom. And as for the laying down of Armes; when the causes which moved them to provide for the defence of his Majesty, the Kingdom, and Parliament, should be taken away, they should very willingly, and chearfully forbear any further Preparations, and lay down their Force allready raised.</Q></P>
<P>WHICH Replication, as they called it, to his Majesty's Answer, they order'd <Q>“”to be Printed, and read in all Churches, and Chappels within the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI></Q> and Dominion of <HI>Wales.</HI> <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>AND so the War was now denounced, by their express Words, against his Majesty; as it had been long before in their Actions; and both Par∣ties seem'd to give over all thoughts of further Treaties, and Overtures; and each prepared to make themselves considerable by the strength, and power of such Forces, as they could draw together.</P>
<P>IN <HI>London</HI> they intended nothing but the forming of their Army, and such other things of power, as were in order thereunto. To that purpose, the Bill for the payment of Tonnage and Poundage being expired, on the first day of <HI>July,</HI> and they having sent another of the same nature to the King for his consent, for six Months longer, his Majesty, since he saw <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> That, and all other Money properly belonging to him, violently taken from him, and imployed by them against him, refused to give his Royal Assent thereunto: Whereupon, without the least haesitation (albeit it had been enacted this very Parliament, <Q>“”that whosoever should presume to pay, or receive that duty, after the expiration of the Act, before the same was regranted to his Majesty with the consent of the Lords and Commons,</Q> should be in a Praemunire; which is the heaviest punish∣ment inflicted by Law, but the loss of Life) they appointed, and or∣der'd by the Power of the two Houses (which they called an Ordinance of Parliament) <Q>“”that the same duty should be continued; and declared <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> that they would save all Persons concern'd, from any Penalty or Pu∣nishment whatsoever:</Q> By which they now became possessed of the Customs, in their own right.</P>
<P>TOWARDS such, as any ways (tho' under the obligation of Oaths or Offices) opposed, or discountenanced what they went about, they pro∣ceeded with the most extravagant severity, that had been ever heard of; of which I shall only mention two Instances; the First, of the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Richard Gurney,</HI> a Citizen of great Wealth, Repu∣tation and Integrity; whom the Lords had, upon the complaint of the House of Commons, before their sending the last Petition to the King (of <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> which his Majesty gave them a touch in his Answer) committed to the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> for causing the King's Proclamation against the Mili∣tia, by vertue of his Majesty's Writ to him directed, and according to the
<PB N="54$" REF="5610"/>
known Duty of this Place, to be publickly proclaim▪d. And shortly after, that they might have a Man more compliant with their designs to go∣vern the City, notwithstanding that he insisted upon his innocence, and made it appear that he was obliged by the Laws of the Land, the Customs of the City, and the Constitution of his Office, and his Oath, to do what∣soever he had done; He was by their Lordships, in the presence of the Commons, adjudged <Q>“”to be put out of his Office of Lord Mayor of <HI>Lon∣don;</HI> to be utterly incapable of bearing Office in City or Kingdom, and of all Honour or Dignity; and to be imprison▪d, during the pleasure of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> the two Houses of Parliament.</Q> And, upon this sentence, Alderman <HI>Pennington,</HI> so often before mention▪d, was, by the noise and clamour of the Common People, against the Customs and Rules of Election, made Mayor; and accordingly installed; and the true, old, worthy Mayor committed to the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> where, with notable courage and constancy, he continued almost to his Death.</P>
<P>THE other Instance, I think fit to mention, is that of Judge <HI>Mallet;</HI> who, as is before remember▪d, was committed to the Tower the last Lent, for having seen a Petition prepared by the grand Jury of <HI>Kent,</HI> for the Countenance of the Book of Common Prayer, and against the imposition <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of the Militia by Ordinance without the Royal Assent. This Judge (being this Summer Circuit, again Judge of Assize for those Counties) sitting at <HI>Maidstone</HI> upon the great Assize, some members of the House of Com∣mons, under the style and title of a Committee of Parliament, came to the Bench; and, producing some Votes, and Orders, and Declarations of one or both Houses, <Q>“”required him, in the name of the Parliament, to cause those Papers (being on the behalf of the Ordinance of the Militia, and against the Commission of Array) "to be read. He told them, "that he fat there by vertue of his Majesty's Commissions; and that he was authorized to do any thing comprised in those Commissions; but he <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> had no Authority to do any thing else; and therefore, there being no mention, in either of his Commissions, of those Papers, or the Publishing any thing of that nature,</Q> he could not, nor would not do it; and so (finding less respect and submission, than they expected, both to their Per∣sons and their Business, from the Learned Judge, and that the whole County, at least the prime Gentlemen and the Grand Jury, which repre∣sented the County, contemn▪d both much more) this Committee return'd to the House with great exclamations against M<SUP>r</SUP> Justice <HI>Mallet,</HI> <Q>“”as the Fomenter and Protector of a Malignant Faction against the Parliament.</Q> And, upon this Charge, a Troop of Horse was sent to attend an Officer; <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> who came with a Warrant from the Houses, or some Committee (whereas Justice <HI>Mallet,</HI> being an Assistant of the House of Peers, could not Regu∣larly be summon▪d by any other Authority) to <HI>Kingston</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> where the Judge was keeping the general Assizes for that County; and, to the unspeakable Dishonour of the Publick Justice of the Kingdom, and the Scandal of all Ministers or Lovers of Justice, in that violent manner took the Judge from the Bench, and carried him Prisoner to <HI>Westminster;</HI> from whence, by the two Houses, he was committed to the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> where he remain'd for the space of above two years, without ever being charged with any particular Crime, till he was redeem'd by his Majesty <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> by the exchange of another, whose liberty they desired.</P>
<P>BY these heightned Acts of Power and Terrour, they quickly demon∣strated, how unsecure it would be for any Man, at least not to concur with them. And, having a General, Armes, Money, and Men enough at
<PB N="544" REF="5620"/>
their devotion, they easily form'd an Army, publickly disposing such Troops and Regiments, as had been raised for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and, at one time, one hunder'd thousand pounds of that Money, which, by Act of Parlia∣ment, had been paid for that purpose, towards the constituting that Army, which was to be led against their Lawful Soveraign. So that it was very evident, they would be in such an Equipage within few Weeks, both with a Train of Artillery, Horse and Foot, all taken, arm'd, furnished, and supplied out of his Majesty's own Magazines and Stores, that they had not reason to fear any opposition. In the mean time, they declared, and published to the People, <Q>“”that they raised that Army, only for the de∣fence <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> of the Parliament, the King's Person, and the Religion, Liberty, and Laws of the Kingdom, and of those, who, for Their sakes, and for those Ends, had obeyed their Orders: That the King, by the instigation of evil Counsellors, had raised a great Army of Papists; by which he intended to awe, and destroy the Parliament; to introduce Popery, and Tyranny: Of which intention, they said, his requiring <HI>Hull;</HI> his send∣ing out Commissions of Array▪ bespeaking Armes and Ammunition beyond the Seas (there having been some brought to him by the Ship called the Providence) his declaring S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> Traytor; and the putting out the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> from being Lord High-Admi∣ral <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of <HI>England;</HI> his removing the Earl of <HI>Pembroke, Essex, Holland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Fielding,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> from their several places and imployments▪ were sufficient and ample evidences: And therefore, they conjured all Men,</Q> to assist their General, the Earl of <HI>Essex.</HI> And, for their better and more secret transaction of all such Counsels, as were ne∣cessary to be enter'd upon, or follow'd, they made a Committee, of some choice Members of either House, to intend the great business of the King∣dom with reference to the Army; who had Authority, without so much as communicating the matter to the House, to imprison Persons, seise upon their Estates; and many other Particulars, which the two <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> Houses, in full Parliament, had not the least Regular, Legal, Justifiable Authority to do. And, for the better encouragement of Men to engage in the Service, the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the five Members of the House of Commons, formerly accused by his Majesty of High-Treason, upon so∣lemn debate, had several Regiments conferr'd on them; and, by their example▪ many other Members of both Houses, some upon their lowness, and decaiedness of their Fortunes, others to get name and reputation to be in the number of Reformers (amongst whom they doubted not all Places of Honour, or Offices of profit, would be bestowed) most upon the confidence, that all would be ended without a Blow, by the King's want <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> of power to gather strength, desired and obtain'd Command of Horse or Foot; their Quality making amends for their want of experience, and their other defects; which were repaired by many good Officers both English, and Scots; the late Troubles having brought many of that tribe to <HI>London,</HI> and the reputation of the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> having drawn others, out of the Low-Countries, to engage in that Service, In the choice of which Officers, whilst they accused the King of a purpose to bring a For∣reign Force, and of entertaining Papists, they neither consider'd Nation nor Religion; but entertain'd all Strangers, and Forreigners, of what Religion soever, who desired to run their Fortune in the War. <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/></P>
<P>ON the other side, Preparations were not made with equal expedition, and success by the King, towards a War: For, tho' he well understood, and discern'd, that he had nothing else to trust to, he was to encounter
<PB N="545" REF="5630"/>
strange Difficulties to do that. He was so far from having Money to levy, or pay Soldiers, that he was, at this very time, compelled, for very real want, to let fall all the Tables kept by his Officers of State in Court, by which so many of all qualities subsisted; and the Prince, and Duke of <HI>York,</HI> eat with his Majesty; which Table only was kept. And whoever knows the Constitution of a Court, well knows what indispositions natu∣rally flow from those declensions; and how ill those Tempers bear any diminution of their own Interests; and, being once indisposed themselves, how easily they infect others. And that which made the present want of <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Money the more intolerable, there was no visible hope from whence sup∣ply could come, in any reasonable time: And that which was a greater want than Money, which Men rather fear'd than found, there were no Armes; for, notwithstanding the fame of the great Store of Ammunition, brought in by that Ship, it consisted only in truth of Cannon, Powder, and Bullet, with eight hundred Musquets, which was all the King's Ma∣gazine. So that the hastning of Levies, which at that time was believed would not prove difficult, would be to little purpose, when they should continue unarm'd. But that which troubled the King more than all these real incapacities of making War, was the temper and constitution of his <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> own Party; which was compounded, for the most part, in Court, Coun∣cil, and Country, of Men drawn to him by the impulsion of Conscience, and abhorring the unjust and irregular proceedings of the Parliament; otherwise unexperienced in Action, and unacquainted with the Mysteries, and necessary Policy of Government; severe observers of the Law, and as scrupulous in all matters relating to it, as the other pretended to be. All his Majesty's Ancient Counsellors, and Servants (except some few of lasting Honour, whom We shall have occasion often to mention) that they might redeem former oversights, or for other unworthy designs, being either publickly against him in <HI>London,</HI> or privately discrediting his In∣terest <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> and Actions, in his own Court. These Men still urged <Q>“”the execu∣tion of the Law; that what extravagances soever the Parliament pra∣cticed, the King's observation of the Law would, in the end, suppress them all.</Q> And, indeed, believed the raising a War to be so wicked a thing, that they thought it impossible the Parliament should intend it, even when they knew what they were doing. However they concluded, <Q>“”that he, that was forwardest in the preparing an Army, would be first odious to the People; by the affections of whom, the other would be easily supprest.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was the general received Doctrine; and tho' it appear'd plainly <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> to others (of equal affection to the Publick Peace) how fatal those Con∣clusions, in that sense in which they were urged, must prove to the whole Kingdom; and how soon the King must be irrecoverably lost, if he pro∣ceeded not more vigorously in his defence; yet even those Men durst not, in any form'd and publick Debate, declare themselves; or speak that plain English the State of Affairs required; but satisfied themselves with speak∣ing, what they thought necessary, to the King in Private; by which means the King wanted those firm, and solid foundations of Counsel and Foresight, that were most necessary for his condition: So that he could neither impart the true motives, and grounds of any important Action, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> nor discover the utmost of his Designs. And so he still seem'd (notwith∣standing the greatest, and avow'd preparations of the Enemy) to intend nothing of Hostility, but in order to the reducing of <HI>Hull;</HI> the benefit of which, he hoped, would engage the Train'd-bands of that great County (which was the sole strength he yet drew thither) till he could bring
<PB N="546" REF="5640"/>
other Forces thither, which might be fit for that, or any other Design.</P>
<P>BUT there was another Reason of his Majesty's going to, and staying at <HI>Beverly,</HI> than was understood; and, it may be, if it had been known, might have produced a better Effect; which I think necessary to insert in this place. The Lord <HI>`Digby,</HI> whom We have mention'd before, in the first disorder, by which the King and Queen were driven from <HI>London,</HI> to have left <HI>England,</HI> and to be after unreasonably accused by the House of Com∣mons of High-Treason, had remain'd from that time in <HI>Holland;</HI> and, hearing the King's condition at <HI>York,</HI> to be so much improved beyond what he left it at <HI>Windsor,</HI> had, with some Commands from the Queen, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> arrived there very privately, and stayed some days in a disguise at <HI>York,</HI> revealing himself to very few Friends, and speaking with the King in so secret a manner in the night, that no notice was taken of his being there; and, finding the King's Affairs not in so good a posture as he expected, and conceiving it yet not fit for him to appear, resolved to return again to the Queen, and to hasten that provision of Armes and Ammunition, without which it was not possible for the King to resist any violence, that threaten'd him; and so, in the same Bark which brought him over, he went again to Sea for <HI>Holland,</HI> with <HI>Wilmot, Ashburnham, Pollard,</HI> and <HI>Berkley;</HI> who purposely removed themselves from Court, upon the cla∣mour <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of the Parliament, till the King was ready to use their Service. They were not many hours at Sea, when they met the Providence (which We mention'd before) with the Ammunition, which was only wanted; and, well knowing her, they agreed, <Q>“”that <HI>Wilmot, Pollard</HI> and <HI>Berkley,</HI> should return with the Ammunition to the King; and <HI>Digby,</HI> and Coll. <HI>Ashburnham,</HI></Q> should pursue their former Intentions for <HI>Holland.</HI> But their Parties continued so long, that the Parliament Ships, who had watched and chased the Providence, came up to them; and, tho' the Ship escaped, and run on shore, as was before mention'd, yet the Fly-boat, in which the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was, could not so well get away; but was taken <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> by them, and carried in with so much the more triumph into <HI>Hull,</HI> that they had been disappointed of their greater Prize. Coll. <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> tho' he was in great umbrage with the Parliament, and one of those Delin∣quents, whom they reproached the King with, was so well known to S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> with whom he stood in a good degree of familiarity, that he could not dissemble or conceal himself; but the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> being in so real a disguise, that his nearest friends would not easily have known him, pretended to be a <HI>French</HI>-man, whose Language he spoke excellent∣ly; and seem'd to be so Sea-sick, that he kept himself in the hole of the Bark, till they came to <HI>Hull;</HI> and, in that time, disposed of such Papers, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> as were not fit to be perused; and, when he came on Shore, so well coun∣terfeited sickness, and want of health, that he easily procured himself to be sent, under a Guard, to some obscure corner for repose; whilst Coll. <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> who was the only Prisoner they thought worth the look∣ing after, was carefully carried to the Governour; who received him with as much Civility, as he could reasonably expect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> THE Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> being by himself, quickly consider'd the desperate∣ness of his condition: <Q>“”That it would not be possible to conceal himself long, being so well known to many who were in the Providence, and the Garrisen quickly knowing whatsoever was spoken of in the Coun∣try: <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> That he was, how unjustly, or unreasonably soever, the most odious Man of the Kingdom to the Parliament; into whose hands if he should then come,</Q> his Life would be, at least, in apparent hazard: And how to get himself out of that Labyrinth was very difficult, since S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI>
<PB N="547" REF="5650"/>
was so far from any inclination of kindness towards him, as he had own'd to Coll. <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> that he was in the Number of his most notorious Enemies. However, in this eminent extremity (as he is a Man of the greatest presence of mind, and the least appalled upon danger, that I have known) he resolved, not to give himself over; and found means to make one of his Guard, in broken English, which might well have become any French-man, understand, <Q>“”that he desired to speak privately with the Governour; and that he would discover some Secrets of the King's, and Queen▪s to him, that would highly advance the Service of the Parlia∣ment.</Q> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> The Fellow made hast to let the Governour know these good tidings; who, understanding French well, as speedily sent for the French∣man; who was brought before him in the presence of much company, and, without any disorder, gave such an account of himself, as they un∣derstood him to have seen much of the French Service of which he spoke very fluently) and to have come over recommended to the King for some Command, if he should have occasion to use Soldiers; as, he said, People abroad conceived him likely to have. After he had entertain'd the com∣pany with such discourse, there being present some Gentlemen, who came lately out of <HI>France,</HI> and so being the more curious to administer <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> questions, he applied himself to the Governour; and told him, <Q>“”that if he might be admitted to privacy with him, he would discover some∣what to him,</Q> which he would not repent to have known. The Gover∣nour, who was a Man apt enough to fear his own safety, but more appre∣hensive of the Jealousies which would attend him (for his eldest Son, and some others, were more absolutely confided in by the Parliament than himself, and were in truth, but Spies over him) would not venture him∣self in another Room; but drew him to a great Window at a convenient distance from the company, and wished him "to say what he thought fit. The Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> finding he could not obtain more privacy, asked him, in <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> English, <Q>“”whether he know him? the other, surprised, told him, <HI>No;</HI> Then, said he, I shall try whether I know S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham;</HI> and whe∣ther he be, in truth, the same Man of Honour, I have allways taken him to be: And, thereupon, told him who he was; and "that he hoped he was too much a Gentleman to deliver him up a sacrifice to Their rage and fury,</Q> who, he well knew, were his implacable Enemies. The other, be∣ing astonished, and scaring that the By-standers would discover him too (for, being now told who he was he wonder'd he found it not out Himself) he desired him <Q>“”to say no more for the present; that he should not be sorry for the trust he reposed in him, and should find him the same Man he <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> had thought him▪ That he would find some time, assoon as conveniently he might, to have more conference with him. In the mean time, that he should content himself with the ill accommodation he had; the amendment whereof would beget suspicion: And so he called the Guard, instantly to carry him away,</Q> and to have a very strict Eye upon him; and, turning to the Company, and being conscious to himself of the trou∣ble and disorder in his Countenance, told them, <Q>“”that the French-man was a shrew▪d Fellow, and understood more of the Queen's Counsels and designs, than a Man would suspect: That he had told him that which the Parliament would be glad to know; to whom presently he would <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> make a dispatch, tho' he had not yet so clear informations, as, he presum'd he should have after two or three days:</Q> And so departed to his Chamber.</P>
<P>IT was a wonderful influence, that this Noble Person's Stars (which used to lead him into, and out of the greatest perplexities and dangers, throughout the whole course of his Life) had upon this whole affair.
<PB N="548" REF="5660"/>
<HI>Hotham</HI> was, by his nature and education, a rough and a rude Man; of great covetousness, of great pride, and great ambition; without any Bowels of good nature, or the least sense, or touch of generosity; his parts were not quick and sharp, but composed, and he judged well; he was a Man of craft, and more like to deceive, than to be couzen'd: Yet, after all this, this young Noble Man, known, and abhorr'd by him, for his ad∣mirable faculty of Dissimulation, had so far prevail'd, and imposed upon his spirit, that he resolved to Practice that Virtue, which the other had Imputed to him; and not to suffer him to fall into the hands of his Ene∣mies. He sent for him, the next day, at an hour when he was more vacant <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> from attendants, and observers; and, at first, told him his resolution; <Q>“”that, since he had so frankly put himself into his hands, he would not deceive his Trust; and wished him "to consider, in what way, and by what colour, he should so set him at Liberty, that he might, without any other danger, arrive at the place where he would be. For, he said, he would not trust any Person living with the Secret, and least of all his Son; whom he mention'd with all the bitterness imaginable, "as a Man of an ill nature, and furiously addicted to the worst designs the Parlia∣ment had, or could have; and One that was more depended upon by them than Himself,</Q> and sent thither only as a Spy upon him. From <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> hence he enter'd upon the discourse <Q>“”of the times, and mischief that was like to befal the whole Kingdom, from the difference between the King and the Parliament. Then lamented his own Fate, "that, being a Man of very different Principles from those, who drove things to this extre∣mity, and of intire affection and duty to the King, he should now be looked upon as the chief ground, and cause of the Civil War which was to ensue, by his not opening the Ports, when the King would have en∣ter'd into the Town:</Q> Of which business, and of all the circumstances attending it, he spake at large; and avow'd, <Q>“”that the information sent him of the King's purpose presently to hang him, was the true cause of <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> his having proceeded in that manner.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who knew wellenough how to cultivate every period of such a discourse, and how to work upon those Passions which were most predominant in him, joyn'd with him in the sense of the Calamities, which were like to befal the Nation; which he bewailed Pathetically; and, <Q>“”that it should be in the power of a handful of ill Men, corrupted in their Affections to the King, and against Monarchy it self, to be able to involve him, and many other of his clear intentions, in their dark Counsels, and to engage them to prosecute ends which they abhorred, and which must determine in the ruin of all the undertakers. For, he <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> told him, that the King, in a short time, would reduce all his Enemies: That the hearts of the People were allready, in all places, aliened from them; and that the Fleet was so much at the King's disposal, that, assoon as they should receive his Orders, they would appear in any place he ap∣pointed▪ That all the Princes in <HI>Christendom</HI> were concern'd in the quarrel, and would engage in it, assoon as they should be invited to it: And that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was resolved to come over in the head of his Army,</Q> and would take <HI>Hull</HI> in three days. All which ought, reason∣ably▪ to have been true in the Practick, tho' it had very little ground in the Speculation. And when he had, by degrees, amused and terrified him <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> with this discourse, he enlarged upon <Q>“”the Honour and Glory, that Man would have, who could be so blessed, as to prevent this terrible Confu∣sion, that was in view: That King and People would joyn in rewarding him with Honours, and Preferments of all kind; and that his Name
<PB N="549" REF="5670"/>
would be derived to Posterity, as the Preserver of his Country. He told him, "He was that Man, that could do all this; that, by delivering up <HI>Hull</HI> to the King, he might extinguish the War; and that immediately a Peace would be established throughout the Kingdom: That the world believed, that he had some credit both with the King, and Queen; that he would imploy it all in his Service; and if he would give him this rise to begin upon, he should find, that he would be much more sollicitous for His greatness, and a full recompence for his merit, than he was now for his own safety.</Q> All these Advertisements, and reflections, were the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> subject of more than one discourse; for S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> could not bear the variety, and burthen of all those thoughts together; but within two days all things were adjusted between them. <HI>Hotham</HI> said, <Q>“”it would not become him, after such a refusal, to put the Town into the King's hands; nor could he undertake (if he resolved) to effect it; the Town it self being in no degree affected to his Majesty's Service; and the Train'd-bands, of which the Garrison wholely consisted, were under Officers upon whom he could not depend. But, he said, if the King would come before the Town, tho' but with one Regiment, and plant his Cannon against it, and make but one shot, he should think he had discharged his <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> Trust to the Parliament, as far as he ought to do; and that he would immediately then deliver up the Town; which he made no doubt but that he should be then able to do.</Q> And, on this errand, he was contented the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> should go to the King, and be conducted out of the Town beyond the limits of danger; the Governour having told those Officers he trusted most, <Q>“”that he would send the French-man to <HI>York;</HI> who, he was well assured,</Q> would return to him again. He gave him likewise a note to a Widow, who lived in that City, at whose house he might lodge, and by whose hands he might transmit any Letters to him▪</P>
<P>WHEN he came to <HI>York,</HI> and after he had spoke with the King, it was <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> resolved, he should appear in his own likeness, and wait upon the King in publick, that it might be believed, that he had transported himself from <HI>Holland</HI> in the Ship, that brought the Ammunition; which was hardly yet come to <HI>York,</HI> it being now about the time that M<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Villiers,</HI> and S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Pennington</HI> had been sent away, and before the news came of their ill success. This was the cause of the suddain March towards <HI>Hull,</HI> before there was a Soldier levied to make an Assault, or maintain a Siege; which was so much wonder'd at then, and so much censur'd afterwards. For assoon as his Majesty received this assurance, which he had so much rea∣son to depend upon, by the treatment the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> had received, he de∣clared, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> "he would, upon such a day, go to <HI>Beverly,</HI> a place within four miles of <HI>Hull;</HI> and appointed three or four Regiments of the Country, under the Command of such Gentlemen whose affection was unquestionable, to march thither, as a Guard to his Person; and likewise sent a little Train of Artillery, which might be ready for the Summons. When his Majesty was ready with this Equipage for his March, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> return'd again in his old disguise to <HI>Hull,</HI> to make sure that all things there might correspond with the former obligation. Assoon as the King, and the whole<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whereupon the King goes to <HI>Beverly</HI> with design upon <HI>Hull,</HI> but in vain.</NOTE> Court (for none remain'd at <HI>York)</HI> came to <HI>Beverly</HI> (where they were all accommodated, which kept them from being quickly weary) and the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> Train'd-bands were likewise come thither, the General, the Earl of <HI>Lind∣sey,</HI> first took possession of his Office; a little troubled, and out of counte∣nance, that he should appear the General without an Army; and be en∣gaged in an Enterprize, which he could not imagine would succeed. His Majesty order'd him to send out some Officers, of which there was a good
<PB N="550" REF="5680"/>
store, to take a view of the Town, and of such advantage ground, within distance, upon which he might raise a Battery; as if he meant on a sud∣dain to assault the place; which appear'd no unreasonable design, if there were a good Party in the Town to depend upon. And yet the General had no opinion, that his Army of Train'd-bands would frankly expose them∣selves to such an Attack: Besides a great number of Officers, and Persons of Quality, who were all well Horsed, and had many Servants as well pro∣vided, the King had his Troop of Guards so constituted, as hath been said before; and there were few Horse in <HI>Hull,</HI> and those without Officers, who understood that kind of Service. So that it was no hard matter to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> take a very full view of the Town, by riding to the very Ports, and about the Walls; nor, at first appearance, was there any shew of Hostility from the Town upon their nearest approaches to it; but after they had made that visit two or three days together, they observed that the Walls were better mann'd, and that there was every day an increase of labourers re∣pairing the Works; and then they begun to Shoot, when any went within distance of the Works.</P>
<P>ALL this while S<SUP>•</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> had tryed some of his Officers, in whose particular affection he had most confidence, how far they were like to be govern'd by him; and found them of a temper not to be relied upon. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> His Son was grown jealous of some design, and was caballing with those, who were most notorious for their disaffection to the Government; and new Officers were sent down, by the Parliament, to assist in the defence of the Town▪ which, they thought, might probably be attempted; and supplies of Men had been taken in from the Ships, and had been sent thi∣ther from <HI>Boston,</HI> a Town, upon the same Coast, of eminent disloyalty. So that▪ when the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> return'd thither, he found a great damp upon the spirit of the Governour, and a sadness of mind, that he had pro∣ceeded so far; of which his Lordship made all the hast he could to adver∣tise the King; but his Letters must first be sent to <HI>York</HI> before they could <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> come to <HI>Beverly;</HI> and, when they were received, they contain'd still somewhat of hope, <Q>“”that he should be able to restore him to his former courage,</Q> and confirm his resolution: So that the King seem'd to defer any attempt, upon the hopes of the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI>s Message before mention'd, and, in the end, he was compelled to give over the design, all hope from the Governour growing desperate; whether from his want of Courage, or want of Power to execute what he desired, remains still un∣certain. When S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham</HI> gave over further thoughts of it, he dis∣missed both the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and Coll. <HI>Ashburnham,</HI> whom he had like∣wise detain'd till then, as a Man of use in the execution of the design, with <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> many professions of Duty to the King; and as the concealing those two Persons, and afterwards releasing them, immediately increased the jea∣lousy of the Parliament against him, so it was the Principal cause, after∣wards, of the loss of his Head.</P>
<P>THE King dismissed the Train'd bands, and return'd with his Court to <HI>York,</HI> in so much less credit than when he came from thence, as the en∣tering into a War without power, or preparation to prosecute it, was like to produce. The inconvenience was the greater, because the principal Persons of Quality, of Court or Country, and the Officers, had the less reverence for the King's conduct, by seeing such an Action enter'd upon with so lit∣tle <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> reason, and prosecuted so perfunctorily: All which reproaches his Ma∣jesty thought fitter to bear, than to discover the Motives of his Journey; which were then known to few, nor, to this day, have been published.</P>
<P>WHEN the King return'd to <HI>York,</HI> exceedingly troubled at the late
<PB N="551" REF="5690"/>
March he had made, and all Men expressing great impatience to be in Action, very many Persons of Honour and Quality, having attended long at Court, believing they might be more useful to his Majesty's Service in their own Countries, in restraining the disaffected from any seditious at∣tempts, and disposing the People in general to be constant in their Loyalty, an Accident fell out, that made it absolutely necessary for the King to de∣clare the War, and to enter upon it, before he was in any degree ripe for Action; which was, that <HI>Portsmouth</HI> had declared for the King, and re∣fused<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Goring,</HI> at <HI>Port<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mouth,</HI> de∣clares for the King.</NOTE> to submit to the Parliament; which had thereupon sent an Army, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> under the Command of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Waller,</HI> to reduce it. The relating how this came to pass, requires a large discourse, and will administer much variety, not without somewhat of pleasure and wonder, from the tem∣per and spirit of the Person who conducted that Action; if it can be said to be conducted without any Conduct.</P>
<P>WE have remember'd before, in the last year, the discourse of the bring∣ing up the Army to <HI>London</HI> to awe the Parliament, and the unspeakable dishonour, and damage the King sustain'd by that discourse, how ground∣less soever it was; all which was imputed to Coll. <HI>Goring,</HI> who, by that means, grew into great reputation with the Parliament, as a Man so irreco∣verably <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> lost at Court, that he would joyn with them in the most desperate designs; yet he carried himself with so great dexterity, that, within few Months, he wrought upon the King and Queen to believe, that he so much repented that fault, that he would redeem it by any Service; and to trust him to that degree, that the Queen, once, resolv'd, when the tumults drove their Majesty's first from <HI>London,</HI> for her security, to put her self into <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> which was under his Government; whilst his Majesty betook himself to the Northern parts; which design was no sooner over (if not before) than he, again, intimated so much of it to the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and that Party, that they took all the trust, he had from Court, to proceed <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> from the confidence, their Majesty's had of his Father's interest in him; whose Affection, and Zeal to their Service was ever most indubitable: but assured themselves, He was their own, even against his own Father. So that he carried the matter so, that, at the same time, he receiv'd 3000<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Queen (which she raised by the sale of her Plate, and some Jewels) to fortify, and victual, and reinforce his Garrison, against the time it should be necessary to declare for the King; and a good supply from the Parliament, for the payment of the Garrison, that it might be kept the better devoted to Them, and to Their Service. All which he perform'd with that admirable dissimulation, and rare confidence, that, when the <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> House of Commons was inform'd by a Member, whose Zeal, and Affection to them was as much valued as any Man's, <Q>“”that all his correspondence in the County was with the most Malignant Persons; that of those, many frequently resorted to, and continued with him in the Garrison; that he was fortifying, and raising of Batteries towards the Land: And that, in his discourse, especially in the seasons of his good fellowship, he used to utter threats against the Parliament, and sharp censures of their Proceedings.</Q> And upon such Informations (the Author whereof was well known to them, and of great reputation; and lived so near <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> that he could not be mistaken, in the matter of fact) the <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> House sent for him, most thinking he would refuse to come.</P>
<P>COLL. <HI>Goring</HI> came, upon the Summons, with that undauntedness, that all clouds of distrust immediately vanished, insomuch as no Man pre∣sum'd to whisper the least jealousy of him; which he observing, came to the House of Commons, of which he was a Member; and, having sate a
<PB N="552" REF="5700"/>
day or two patiently, as if he expected some Charge, in the end he stood up, with a countenance full of modesty, and yet not without a mixture of anger (as he could help himself with all the insinuations of doubt, or fear, or shame, or simplicity in his face, that might gain belief, to a greater de∣gree than I ever saw any Man; and could seem the most confounded when he was best prepared, and the most out of countenance when he was best resolved, and to want words, and the habit of speaking, when they flow'd from no Man with greater power) and told them, <Q>“”that he had been sent for by them, upon some information given against him, and that, tho' he believed, the Charge being so ridiculous, they might have received, by <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> their own particular inquiry, satisfaction; yet the discourses that had been used, and his being sent for in that manner, had begot some Preju∣dice to him in his reputation; which if he could not preserve, he should be less able to do Them service; and therefore desired, that he might have leave (tho' very unskilful, and unfit to speak, in so wise and judicious an Assembly) to present to them the state and condition of that Place un∣der his Command; and then he doubted not but to give them full satis∣faction in those Particulars, which, possibly, had made some impression in them to his disadvantage: That he was far from taking it ill from those, who had given any information against him; for, what he had <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> done, and must do, might give some Umbrage to well affected Persons, who knew not the grounds and reasons, that induced him so to do; but that if any such Person would, at any time, resort to him, he would clearly inform them of whatever Motives he had; and would be glad of their Advice,</Q> and Assistance for the better doing thereof. Then he took notice of every particular that had been publickly said against him, or pri∣vately whisper'd, and gave such plausible Answers to the whole, inter∣mingling sharp taunts, and scorns, to what had been said of him, with pretty application of himself, and flattery to the Men that spake it: Con∣cluding, <Q>“”that they well knew, in what esteem he stood with others; so <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> that if, by his ill carriage, he should forfeit the good opinion of that House, upon which he only depended, and to whose Service he intirely devoted himself, he were madder than his Friends took him to be, and must be as unpitied in any misery, that could befall him, as his Enemies would be glad to see him.</Q> With which, as innocently and unaffectedly uttered, as can be imagin'd, he got so general an Applause from the whole House, that, not without some little Apology for troubling him, <Q>“”they desir'd him again to repair to his Government, and to finish those Works, which were necessary for the safety of the place;</Q> and gratified him with consenting to all the Propositions, he made in behalf of his Garrison, and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> paid him a good sum of Money for their Arrears; with which, and being privately assured (which was indeed resolved on) that he should be Lieu∣tenant General of their Horse in their new Army, when it should be form'd, he departed again to <HI>Portsmouth;</HI> in the mean time, assuring his Majesty by those, who were trusted between them, <Q>“”that he would be speedily in a Posture to make any such Declaration for his Service, as he should be required;</Q> which he was forced to do sooner than he was provided for it, tho' not sooner than he had reason to expect.</P>
<P>WHEN the Levies for the Parliament Army were in good forward∣ness, and that Lord had received his Commission for Lieutenant General <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of the Horse, he wrote to the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> who was his most bosome Friend, and a Man very powerful, desiring, <Q>“”that he might not be called to give his attendance upon the Army, till it was ready to march; be∣cause there were so many things to be done, and perfected, for the safety
<PB N="553" REF="5710"/>
of that important Place, that he was desirous to be present Himself at the work as long as was possible. In the mean time, he had given di∣rections to his Agent in <HI>London,</HI> to prepare all things for his equipage; so that he would be ready to appear, at any Rendezvous, upon a days warning.</Q> Tho' the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> did much desire his company, and as∣sistance in the Council of War, and preparing the Articles, and forming the Discipline for the Army, he having been more lately versed in the Order and Rule of Marches, and the provisions necessary, or convenient there∣unto, than any Man then in their Service, and of greater Command than <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> any Man but the General; yet the Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> prevailed, that he might not be sent for, till things were riper for Action. And, when that Lord did afterwards write to him, <Q>“”that it was time he should come away,</Q> he sent such new, and reasonable excuses, that they were not un∣satisfied with his delay; till he had multiplied those excuses so long, that they begun to suspect; and they no sooner inclined to suspicion but they met with abundant Arguments to cherish it. His behaviour and course of Life was very notorious to all the Neighbours, nor was he at all reserv'd in his mirth, and publick Discourses, to conceal his opinion of the Parlia∣ment, and their Proceedings. So that, at last, the Lord <HI>Kimbolton</HI> writ <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> plainly to him, <Q>“”that he could no longer excuse his absence from the Ar∣my, where he was much wanted; and that, if he did not come to <HI>London</HI> by such a short day, as he named, he found his Integrity would be doubt∣ed; and that many things were laid to his charge, of which he doubted not his innocence; and therefore conjured him, immediately, to be at <HI>Westminster;</HI></Q> it being now to be no longer deferr'd, or put off. He wr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a jolly Letter to that Lord, <Q>“”that, the truth was, his Council advised him, that the Parliament did many things which were illegal; and that he might incur much danger by obeying all their Orders; that he had re∣ceived the Command of that Garrison from the King; and that he durst <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> not be absent from it,</Q> without His leave: And concluded with some good Counsel to the Lord.</P>
<P>THIS Declaration of the Governour of a place, which had the reputa∣tion of being the only place of strength in <HI>England,</HI> and situated upon the Sea, put them into many apprehensions; and they lost no time in endea∣vouring to reduce it; but, upon the first understanding his resolution, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>William Waller</HI> was sent, with a good part of the Army, so to block it up, that neither Men, nor Provision, might be able to get in; and some Ships were sent from the Fleet, to prevent any relief by Sea: And these ad∣vertisements came to the King, assoon as he return'd to <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> IT gave no small reputation to his Majesty's Affairs, when there was so great a damp upon the spirits of Men, from the misadventures at <HI>Be∣verly,</HI> that so notable a place as <HI>Portsmouth</HI> had declared for him, in the very beginning of the War; and that so good an Officer as <HI>Goring,</HI> was re∣turn'd to his duty, and in the possession of the Town: And the King, who was not surprised with the matter, knowing well the resolution of the Colonel, made no doubt, but that he was very well supplied with all things, as he might well have been, to have given the Rebels work for three, or four Months, at the least. Whereupon, he forthwith published a Declara∣tion▪ that had been long ready, in which he recapitulated all the Insolent, <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and Rebellious Actions the two Houses had committed against him▪ and declared them <Q>“”to be guilty; and forbid all his Subjects to yield any obe∣dience to them:</Q> And, at the same time, published his Proclamation; by which, he <Q>“”required all Men, who could bear Armes, to repair to him at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> by the 25<SUP>th</SUP> of <HI>August</HI> following; on which day, he would
<PB N="554" REF="5720"/>
set up his Royal Standard there, which all good Subjects were obliged to attend.</Q> At the same time, he sent the Marquis of <HI>Hertford</HI> to raise Forces in the West, or, at least, to restrain those parts (where His Interest, and Reputation was greater than any Man's) within the limits of their Duty to the King, and from being corrupted, or perverted by the Parlia∣ment▪ and with him went the Lord <HI>Seymour,</HI> his Brother; the Lord <HI>Pawlet, Hopton, Stawel, Coventry, Berkely, Windham,</HI> and some other Gentlemen, of the prime Quality, and Interest in the Western parts; who were like to give as good examples in their Persons, and to be follow'd by as many Men, as any such Number of Gentlemen in <HI>England</HI> could be. <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> And, from this Party, enliven'd by the power, and reputation of the Mar∣quis, the King was in hopes, that <HI>Portsmouth</HI> would be shortly relieved, and made the head quarter to a good Army. When all this was done, he did all that was possible to be done, without Money, to hasten his Levies of Horse and Foot, and to prepare a light train of Artillery; that he might appear at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> at the day when the Standard was to be set up, with such a body of Men, as might be, at the least, a competent Guard to his Person.</P>
<P>MANY were then of opinion, <Q>“”that it had been more for his Majesty's benefit and Service, if the Standard had been appointed to be set up at <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> <HI>York;</HI> and so that the King had stayed there, without moving further South, until he could have marched in the head of an Army, and not to depend upon gathering an Army up in his March. All the Northern Counties were, at present, most at his devotion; and so it would be most easy to raise Men there: <HI>New-Castle</HI> was the only Port in his obedience, and whither he had appointed his supplies of Armes, and Ammunition to be sent; of which he had so present need, that all his Magazine, which was brought in the Providence, was allready distributed to those few Gentlemen, who had received Commissions, and were most like speedily to raise their Regiments; and it would be a very long, and <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> might prove a very dangerous passage to get the supplies, which were daily expected, to be brought with security from <HI>New-Castle,</HI> when the King should be advanced so many days Journey beyond <HI>York.</HI></Q> All which were very important considerations, and ought to have prevailed; but the King's inclinations to be nearer <HI>London,</HI> and the expectation he had of great effects from <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and the West, disposed him to a willing∣ness to prefer <HI>Nottingham;</HI> but that which determin'd the Point, was an apparent, and manifest aversion in the <HI>York-shire</HI> Gentlemen, whose af∣fections were least suspected, that his Majesty should continue▪ and remain at <HI>York;</HI> <Q>“”which, they said, the People apprehended, would inevitably <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> make that Country the seat of the War:</Q> unskilfully imagining, that the War would be no where, but where the King's Army was; and therefore they facilitated all things, which might contribute to his remove from thence; undertook, to provide Convoys for any Armes and Ammunition from <HI>New-Castle;</HI> to hasten the Levies in their own Country; and to borrow the Armes of some of the Train'd-bands; which was the best ex∣pedient, that could be found out, to arm the King's Troops, and had it's reverse in the murmurs it produced, and in leaving the best affected Men, by being disarm'd, at the mercy of their Enemies; who carefully kept their Weapons, that they might be ready to fight against the King. This <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> caused the resolution to be taken for <HI>Nottingham,</HI> without enough weigh∣ing the objections, which, upon the Entrance into great Actions, cannot be too much deliberated, tho', in the Execution, they were best shut out. And it quickly appeared in those very Men, who prevailed most in that
<PB N="555" REF="5730"/>
Council; for, when the time drew on, in which his Majesty was to depart, and leave the Country, Then they remember'd, <Q>“”that the Garrison of <HI>Hull</HI> would be left as a thorn in their sides, where there were well form'd, and active Troops, which might march over the Country with∣out control, and come into <HI>York</HI> it self without resistance: That there were many disaffected Persons of Quality, and Interest in the Country, who, assoon as the King should be gone, would appear amongst their neighbours, and find a concurrence from them in their worst designs; and that there were some places, some whole Corporations, so noto∣riously <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> disaffected, especially in matters relating to the Church, that they wanted only Conductors to carry them into Rebellion.</Q></P>
<P>THESE, and the like reflections, made too late impressions upon them; and Now, too much, they magnified this Man's power▪ whom before they contemn'd; and doubted that Man's Affection, of which they were before secure; and made a thousand Propositions to the King this day, whereof they rejected the greatest part to morrow; and, as the day approached nearer for the King's departure, their apprehensions and irresolutions in∣creased. In the end, they were united in two Requests to the King; <Q>that “”he would commit the supreme Command of the Country, with re∣ference <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> to all Military Affairs, to the Earl of <HI>Cumberland;</HI> and qualify him, with an ample Commission, to that purpose. The other, ▪that his Majesty would command S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Glemham</HI> to remain with them, to govern and command such Forces, as the Earl of <HI>Cumberland</HI> should find necessary for their defence.</Q> And this Provision being made by the King, they obliged themselves to concur in making any preparations, and forming any Forces the Earl should require. His Majesty, as willingly, gratified them in both their desires. The Earl of <HI>Cumberland</HI> was a Man of great Honour and Integrity, who had all his Estate in that Country▪ and had lived most amongst them, with very much acceptation, and af∣fection <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> from the Gentlemen, and the Common People: but he was not, in any degree, active, or of a Martial temper; and rather a Man more like not to have any Enemies, than to oblige any to be firmly, and reso∣lutely his Friends, or to pursue his Interest: The great Fortune of the Family was divided, and the greater part of it carried away by an Heir Female; and his Father had so wasted the remainder, that the Earl could not live with that lustre, nor draw so great a dependence upon him, as his Ancestors had done. In a word, he was a Man of Honour, and Popular enough in Peace, but not endued with those parts, which were necessary for Such a season. S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Glemham</HI> was a Gentleman of a noble ex∣traction, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and a fair Fortune, tho' he had much impaired it; he had spent many years, in Armies, beyond the Seas; and he had been an Officer of very good esteem in the King's Armies, and of Courage, and Integrity un∣questionable; but he was not of so stirring and active a nature, as to be able to infuse Fire enough into the Flegmatick constitutions of that Peo∣ple, who did rather wish to be Spectators of the War, than Parties in it; and believed, if they did not provoke the other Party, they might all live quietly together; untill S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>John Hotham,</HI> by his excursions, and depreda∣tions out of <HI>Hull,</HI> and their seditious Neighbours, by their Insurrections, awaken'd them out of that Pleasant Dream. And then the greatest part <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> of the Gentry of that Populous Country, and very many of the Common People, did behave themselves with signal Fidelity, and Courage in the King's Service: Of all which Particulars, which deserve well to be re∣member'd, and transmitted to Posterity, there will be occasion to make mention, in the following Discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="556" REF="5740"/>
YET I cannot leave <HI>York</HI> without the mention of one Particular; which, in truth, is a lively Instance of the Spirit and Temper of that time, and was a sad Presage of all the misfortunes which follow▪d. There were very few Gentlemen, or Men of any Quality, in that large County, who were actively or factiously disaffected to his Majesty; and of those the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and his Son, S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> were the chief; who were govern▪d by two or three, of inferiour Quality, more conversant with the People; who were as well known as They. All these were in the County, at their Houses, within few miles of <HI>York;</HI> and the King resolved, at his going away, to have taken them all Prisoners, and to have put them in <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> safe Custody; by which, it was very probable, those mischiefs, that short∣ly after broke out, might have been prevented. But the Gentlemen of the County, who were met together to consult for their own security, hearing of this Design, besought his Majesty <Q>“”Not to do it; alledging, ▪that he would, thereby, leave them in a worse condition, by an Act so ungra∣cious, and unpopular; and that the disaffected would be so far from be∣ing weaken▪d,</Q> that their Party would be increased thereby; many really believing, that neither Father nor Son were transported with over-vehe∣ment inclinations to the Parliament; but would willingly sit still, with∣out being Active on either side; which, no doubt, was a Policy, that many <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> of those, who wished well, desired and intended to be safe by. And so his Majesty left <HI>York,</HI> taking with him only two or three of inferior rank (whereof one <HI>Stapleton</HI> was one) who were known to have been very active in stirring the People to Sedition; and yet, upon some specious pretences, some very good Men were perswaded, within few days, to procure the Liberty and Inlargement even of those from his Majesty. So ticklish were those times, and so wary were all Men to advise, the King should do any thing, which, upon the strictest inquisition, might seem to swerve from the strict rule of the Law; beleiving, unreasonably, that the softest and gentlest Remedies might be most wholesomely ap∣plied <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="line"/> to those rough, and violent Diseases.</P>
<P>THE King came to <HI>Nottingham</HI> two or three days before the day, he had appointed to set up the Standard; having taken <HI>Lincoln</HI> in his way, and drawn some Armes from the Train▪d-bands of that Country with him to <HI>Nottingham;</HI> from whence, the next day, he went to take a veiw of his Horse; whereof there were several Troops well arm'd, and under good Officers, to the number of seven or eight hundred Men; with which, being inform'd, <Q>“”that there were some Regiments of Foot marching to∣wards <HI>Coventry,</HI></Q> by the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> his Orders, he made hast thither; making little doubt, but that he should be able to get thither before them, <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="line"/> and so to possess himself of that City; and he did get thither the day be∣fore they came; but found, not only the Gates shut against him, but some of his Servants shot, and wounded from the Walls: Nor could all his Messages, and Summons prevail with the Mayor and Magistrates, before there was any Garrison there, to suffer the King to enter into the City. So great an Interest, and Reputation the Parliament had gotten over the Affections of that People, whose hearts were alienated from any reverence to the Government.</P>
<P>THE King could not remedy the Affront, but went that night to <HI>Stonely,</HI> the House then of S<SUP>r</SUP> <HI>Thomas Lee;</HI> where he was well received; <MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="line"/> and, the next day, his Body of Horse, having a clear view, upon an open Campania, for five or six miles together, of the Enemies small Body of Foot, which consisted not of above twelve Hundred Men with one Troop of Horse, which Marched with them over that plain, retired before
<PB N="557" REF="5750"/>
them, without giving them one Charge; which was imputed to the ill conduct of <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who Commanded; and had a colder Courage, than many who were under him, and who were of opinion, that they might have easily defeated that Body of Foot: Which would have been a very seasonable Victory; would have put <HI>Coventry</HI> unquestionably into the King's hands, and sent him with a good Omen to the setting up of his Standard. Whereas, that unhappy Retreat, which looked like a Defeat, and the Rebellious behaviour of <HI>Coventry,</HI> made his Majesty's return to <HI>Nitingham</HI> very Melancholy; whither he return'd the very day the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="line"/> Standard was appointed to be set up.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Standard se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up at <HI>Not∣tingham, Aug. 25. 1642.</HI></NOTE> ACCORDING to the Proclamation, upon the twenty fifth day of <HI>August,</HI> the Standard was erected, about six of the Clock in the even∣ing of a very stormy, and tempestuous day. The King himself, with a small train, rode to the top of the <HI>Castle</HI>▪Hill, <HI>Varney</HI> the Knight Marshal, who was Standard Bearer, carrying the Standard, which was then erected, in that place, with little other Ceremony than the sound of Drums, and Trumpets: Melancholy Men observed many ill Pre∣sages about that time. There was not one▪Regiment of Foot yet brought thither, so that the Train'd-bands, which the Sheriff had drawn toge∣ther, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="line"/> were all the strength the King had for his Person, and the Guard of the Standard. There appeared no Conflux of Men in obedience to the Proclamation; the Armes, and Ammunition were not yet come from <HI>York,</HI> and a General Sadness cover'd the whole Town. The Standard was blown down, the same night it had been set up, by a very strong and unruly wind, and could not be fixed again in a day or two, till the tempest was allayed. This was the Melancholy State of the King's Affairs, when the Standard was set up.</P>
