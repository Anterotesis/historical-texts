<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>OEMS of this Nature are gene∣rally interpreted as the Result of Malice or Disappointment, and the candid Reader is too apt to conclude against the <HI>Satyrist,</HI> as a Peevish, Ill-natur'd Man, or a Desperate, Unsuccessful Lover: However liable I may be to the <HI>former</HI> of these Imputations, I esteem my self safe enough against the <HI>latter,</HI> from any Person who has the least Knowledge of the Ladies, with whom I have to deal in the following Papers; for, alas! Crosses and Disappoinments in Love, are Things almost unknown to our University-Gal∣lants; it is next to impossible for any Thing in
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
a <HI>Cap</HI> and a <HI>Gown,</HI> that has the Appearance of a Man, a little Money, and a tolerable As∣surance, to fail in his Addresses; they strike into any Measures and catch at the first Overtures of Love before Reason and Reflection step in and cool the Heat and Vehemence of a wanton Pas∣sion: In short, the Man that dies for Love, at <HI>Oxford,</HI> is, in the strictest Sense, guilty of <HI>Self-Murther,</HI> and ought to be treated as such, with all the Ignominous Severity of the Law.</P>
<P>And if a sincere Abhorrence of Pride, Lust, Vanity and Impudence, must be called Malice and Ill-Nature, it is, however, some Comfort to me, to reflect that I am not the only Per∣son to bear the Load; as I am not the only One that has taken Notice of the almost universal Cor∣ruption of our Youth, which is to he imputed to nothing so much as to that Multitude of Female <HI>Residentiaries,</HI> who have of late infested our Learned Retirements, and drawn off Num∣bers of unwary young Persons from their Studies. They have been indeed very success∣ful in their Labours of Reformation, for (as the Ingenious Author of a Letter upon this Subject, publish'd in the <HI>Freethinker,</HI> rightly
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
observes) there appears to be a prevailing An∣tipathy to every thing that is serious and laud∣able, and to even the Name and Character of <HI>Scholars;</HI> they look upon <HI>Scholar,</HI> as an unpolite pedantick Word, incompatible with the more pleasing Names of <HI>clever Fellows,</HI> and <HI>fine Gentlemen:</HI> The Face of Learning is almost quite worn off, and it is become highly scandalous to carry the least Mark of a Philo∣sopher about us; a grave Countenance and a sober Habit, are treated as the Object of Ridicule, and the Person who appears not to have made the Fashions and the <HI>Beau-Monde</HI> the greatest Part of his Studies, is sure to be laugh'd at for a dull, heavy, plodding Wretch, a mere Clown, or a Pedant: There appears on the Foreheads of the greatest Part of our Stu∣dents an unthoughtful Openness and Levity; and in their Dress an unbecoming Shewiness and Af∣fectation; <HI>Silk-Gowns, Tye-Wiggs,</HI> and <HI>Ruffles,</HI> are become necessary Accomplishments for a Man of Sense, and our <HI>Colleges,</HI> instead of grave Philosophers and <HI>Literati,</HI> swarm with <HI>Smarts</HI> and Foplings, that is, Consummate Coxcombs.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6"/>A College-<HI>SMART,</HI> is a Character, which few perhaps are acquainted with; He is one that spends his Time in a constant Circle of En∣gagements and Assignations; He rises at Ten, tattles over his Tea-Table till Twelve, Dines, Dresses; waits upon his Mistress, drinks Tea again, flutters about in Publick 'till it is dark, then to the Tavern, knocks into College at Two in the Morning, sleeps 'till Ten again, and dis∣poses of the following Day, just as he did of the last: He affects great Company, and scrapes Ac∣quaintance with <HI>golden Tufts</HI> and <HI>brocaded Gowns;</HI> and after a course of Studies of this Nature for three or four Years, he hud∣dles over publick Exercises, disputes and pas∣ses Examination in the Sciences after the mo∣dern Fashion, without understanding a word of what, like a Parrot, he is taught memorially to utter: He then canvasses and obtains his <HI>Grace</HI> amongst the Ladies, and takes his De∣gree with uncommon Marks of Honour; and thus passes for a most profound Scholar, meer∣ly by being an arrant Blockhead. This Class of Men is very numerous amongst us, and dai∣ly encreases without Controul, to the great
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
Scandal and Discredit of all useful Learning, and is an Enormity of very bad Consequence, as it may in Time sap the Foundation of the most famous and flourishing University in the World.</P>
<P>But the Mischief does not stop here; for alas! We have too many Instances of unfortunate Gentlemen, who not only neglect their Studies, and frustrate the prudent Purposes of their indul∣gent Parents, but who, Step by Step, are often pre∣vail'd upon to throw off all sense of Duty and Interest, to involve themselves into inextricable Ruin, and their Friends into the bitterest Sor∣rows, by marrying some tit Thing or other of mean Parentage, and suspected Morals: And this is indeed a Thing so very practicable upon young Men of raw Judgment and warm Inclinations, and there are so many of these <HI>Kidnapping Females</HI> still upon the Watch, and <HI>seeking whom they may devour,</HI> that it is enough to discourage a fond Parent or a careful Guar∣dian, from sending his Son or his Ward to a Place which abounds with so many Deceivers, (who take all possible Opportunities of serving their pernicious Designs) and where they must be
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
assaulted by so many bewitching Temptations. Our <HI>OXFORD FORTUNES</HI> are justly bran∣ded for a Proverb all over the Nation, for they really rise out of the lowest Dregs of Mankind; The Daughters of our <HI>Coblers, Tinkers, Taylors,</HI> and of the most scoundrel Professions set out with a Dancing-School Education, and trap themselves out in all the outside Gayity they can afford; so that they are to be known from true Gentlewomen, only by their unconquerable Pride and awkard Insolence. It is at <HI>Oxford</HI> no Rarity to see a poor Man work hard for a Twelve-Month, to make his Girl look fine on a Sunday, and almost starve his Family at Home in order to gratifie his Vanity and Ambition A∣broad. I would not willingly from hence be thought to insult my Inferiors, nor to treat any Fellow-Creature opprobriously, because Fortune has placed him in a lower Scene of Life than my self, since my Design is only to let them know that they are not to look above themselves, but to be contented with their own humble Condition, and not by infamous Methods endeavour to raise themselves by ruining of others; and to warn my Fellow-Students to shun all Commerce with such aspiring <HI>Beggars,</HI> to shut their Eyes to
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
their Beauty, and their Ears to their Inchant∣ments; to pursue their Studies with unwearied Application, to make the best use of the Talents and Opportunities which are intrusted to them, to do every Thing in its proper Season, and not leave the sublime and useful Lessons of Phi∣losophy, for the prettiest <HI>Whore</HI> in Christen∣dom.</P>
<P>I have one Thing more to mention before I conclude. I hope Mrs. <HI>T-rr-l</HI> will now be con∣vinc'd, that there is in the University one who, if he has not <HI>Sense</HI> enough, has at least <HI>Cou∣rage</HI> enough to attack the <HI>Oxford Beauties</HI> in a Satire, and I would therefore advise her for the future to be more modest, and not set so great a Value upon her self and her Friends, as to think their Persons sacred and inviolable. They are not always to be <HI>Phyllised</HI> up in fulsom Panegyrick, and it would better become them not to grow so insolent when they are, for fear some bold, impudent Fellow like my self, should rise up and divest them of their borrowed Excellencies and shew them naked in their own proper Deformi∣ties: Their Champion has made <HI>Nymphs, An∣gels</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
and <HI>Goddesses</HI> of 'em all; I have shew∣ed them in a quite different Light, and which of us has drawn the Picture most like the Original, I am willing to leave the impartial World to determine.</P>

<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T length with Vengeance bursts my raging Vein,</L>
<L>Nor longer will th' imprison'd Wrath contain;</L>
<L>Thy Shame, oh! <HI>Oxford,</HI> in reluctant Verse,</L>
<L>Justice and Honour force me to rehearse:</L>
<L>Long did I strive inchain'd my Rage to keep,</L>
<L>And sooth'd the Tumults of my Blood asleep,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="12"/>I wav'd th' ill-natur'd Task from Time to Time,</L>
<L>While filial Duty seem'd to check the Rhime,</L>
<L>But all in vain to quench my Gall conspire,</L>
<L>Rage spurs me on, a Fury strings my Lyre.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And see! to banish all remaining Fears,</L>
<L>Our LEARNED MOTHER to my Eyes appears;</L>
<L>'Twas Noon of Night, when blest with sweet Repose,</L>
<L>The pleasing Vision to my Fancy rose,</L>
<L>Thro' ambient Darkness, venerably bright,</L>
<L>The graceful Dame descended to my Sight;</L>
<L>A Lawrel-Crown her hoary Temples grac'd,</L>
<L>Her stately Limbs a sable Stole embrac'd,</L>
<L>Two River-Deities on either Side,</L>
<L>Pour'd from their fruitful Urns the rushing Tide;</L>
<L><HI>Isis</HI> and <HI>Charwell,</HI> thro' the World renown'd,</L>
<L>Their Brows with ample Wreaths of Sedges crown'd,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="13"/>The Virgin-Muses gently march'd before,</L>
<L>And in their Hands immortal CAT o bore,</L>
<L>Behind, the Arts and Sciences were seen,</L>
<L>With studious downcast Looks and thoughtful Mein;</L>
<L>Ready to speak the rev'rend Form appear'd,</L>
<L>And list'ning, these propitious Words I heard:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Fear not, my Son, in this degen'rate Age</L>
<L>"To give a Loose to thy severest Rage,</L>
<L>"The stench of Brothels, and the filth of Stews,</L>
<L>"Call loud for Censure, and demand the Muse;</L>
<L>"Within our Walls a num'rous, shameless Race</L>
<L>"(To useful Arts and Learning a Disgrace)</L>
<L>"Seduce to Folly the unpractis'd Youth,</L>
<L>"And turn his Footsteps from the Paths of Truth;</L>
<L>"While in our Schools declining Science fails,</L>
<L>"And Love alone and Gallantry prevails;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="14"/>"<HI>Oxford</HI> seems tott'ring to her sudden Doom,</L>
<L>"And <HI>Athens</HI> a mere <HI>Paphos</HI> is become.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"O! rise in all thy Rage, chastise the Times,</L>
<L>"And Female Frauds unveil in daring Rhimes;</L>
<L>"Describe to view their Follies and Delights,</L>
<L>"Their vicious open Days, and hidden Nights;</L>
<L>"Nor think that <HI>Duty</HI> binds Thee to conceal,</L>
<L>"What Justice, Truth and Virtue would reveal,</L>
<L>"To punish reigning Vice deserves our Love,</L>
<L>"And to be Silent now, is to approve.</L>
<L>She said, and vanish'd from my gazing Sight,</L>
<L>Sleep loos'd my Eyes, and I awoke to Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far hence let ev'ry softer Thought remove</L>
<L>Of childish Pity, and unmanly Love;</L>
<L>Let dull Compassion in my Bowels sleep,</L>
<L>And thro' my Breast Satyric Whirlwinds sweep;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="15"/>Ye Fiends and Furies my Revenge inspire,</L>
<L>Swell up my Heart and set my Soul on Fire;</L>
<L>Transfuse your rankest Gall into my Veins,</L>
<L>And keen as <HI>Oldham</HI>'s, prompt my Vengeful Strains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Prayer is heard, for now the rising Spleen</L>
<L>Swells all my Breast, and in my Face is seen;</L>
<L>With livid Flames my glareing Eye-balls roll,</L>
<L>And tenfold Vengeance wraps my lab'ring Soul:</L>
<L>My ev'ry Limb with boundless Fury shakes,</L>
<L>And round my Temples hiss the twining Snakes:</L>
<L>Hush'd are a while ev'n Love's tempestuous Tides,</L>
<L>And the fierce Torrent of my Blood subsides;</L>
<L>A while my beauteous LAURA I despise,</L>
<L>And all the Softness of my Nature dies;</L>
<L>Within my Breast no wonted Passions move,</L>
<L>Heal'd are my Wounds, and I forget to Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
<L>With gen'rous Grief I mourn our <HI>Oxford</HI>'s Fate,</L>
<L>Her fading Glories and declining State;</L>
<L>The Muses, banish'd by an Harlot-train,</L>
<L>In other Lands renew the Tuneful Strain;</L>
<L><HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> quit disgrac'd the Field,</L>
<L>And to the Skillful Dancing-Master yield;</L>
<L>Our <HI>Colleges</HI> grow elegantly dull,</L>
<L>Our <HI>Schools</HI> are empty, and our <HI>Taverns</HI> full.</L>
<L>The gowned Youth dissolves in am'rous Dreams,</L>
<L>And <HI>Pedantry</HI> to him all Learning seems;</L>
<L>He wastes his Bloom in Vanity and Ease,</L>
<L>And his Chief Studies are to <HI>Dress</HI> and Please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From Place to Place the <HI>Dunghil-tribe</HI> I fly,</L>
<L>And strive, in vain, to shut them from my Eye;</L>
<L>If thro' the lonely, smiling Meads I stray,</L>
<L>And by the <HI>Charwel</HI> pace my Thoughtful Way,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="17"/>Loud Female Laughters reach my distant Ears,</L>
<L>Before my Eyes the tawdry Manteau glares;</L>
<L>I shun th' approaching Sight, to Madness wrought,</L>
<L>And loose in Air the scatter'd Train of Thought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If to the <HI>Tavern</HI> social Mirth invites,</L>
<L>With constant Pain I spend the joyless Nights;</L>
<L>Scrawl'd on the Glass I read the hated Names,</L>
<L>While my swoln Breast with Indignation flames,</L>
<L>The whining Blockheads, each his Toast assign,</L>
<L>And pall, with nauseous Praise, the gen'rous Wine;</L>
<L>I fret, I rail, with angry Bile I fume,</L>
<L>And broken Pipes and Glasses strew the Room.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sometimes I turn the golden Antients o're,</L>
<L>Or LOCK, the second <HI>Stagyrite,</HI> explore;</L>
<L>From Argument to Argument I stray,</L>
<L>And follow close where Reason points the Way,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="18"/>Sometimes I drink at the <HI>Pierian</HI> Spring,</L>
<L>And trembling wanton on a youthful Wing;</L>
<L>But still the wonted Scene my Thought employs,</L>
<L>Cloggs all my Studies and dilutes my Joys.</L>
<L>Ev'n Sleep to me denies the needful Rest,</L>
<L>Or sleeping, Fancy haunts my troubled Breast;</L>
<L>The Plague and Torment of the Day returns,</L>
<L>And with Revenge my Soul in Slumber burns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nay, if at <HI>Church</HI> I bend the suppliant Knee,</L>
<L>Nor then from their damn'd Presence am I free;</L>
<L>The loathsome Object ev'n pursues me there,</L>
<L>I burst with Fury in the midst of Prayer;</L>
<L>Just as in fervent Transports I expire,</L>
<L>And my Soul mounts on Wings of hallow'd Fire,</L>
<L>Some haughty, worthless Minion meets my Sight,</L>
<L>And checks Devotion in its middle Height;</L>
<L>With Scorn upon each maudlin Face I dwell,</L>
<L>And with a pious, silent Madness swell.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="19"/>When the loud Organ to the Anthem plays,</L>
<L>And thro' the various Notes harmonious strays,</L>
<L>O! how demure the list'ning Harlots leer,</L>
<L>And drink the Musick in at either Ear;</L>
<L>How the Sluts languish with deceitful Pride,</L>
<L>And ogling drop the pretty Head aside:</L>
<L>In Church they practise each new Female Air,</L>
<L>And to a <HI>Playhouse</HI> turn the <HI>House of Prayer.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well for the Church may pious Christians fear,</L>
<L>And from its Dangers judge its Downfal near,</L>
<L>Since it is now become the publick Mart,</L>
<L>Where female Quacks display their Emp'rick Art.</L>
<L>Hither for Sale throng many a shining Toast,</L>
<L>The lawful Goods of him that proffers most;</L>
<L>Beauties of every Sort and Size appear,</L>
<L>That please all Fancies and all Prices bear;</L>
<L>The tall and short, the jolly and the lean,</L>
<L>Of ev'ry Age from Forty to Fifteen;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="20"/>Black, Brown and Fair are rang'd in different Pews,</L>
<L>That amorous Customers may pick and chuse:</L>
<L>Here sanguine Youths, dispos'd for married Lives,</L>
<L>And future <HI>Parsons</HI> are supply'd with Wives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not more debas'd the Sabbath was of old,</L>
<L>When <HI>Flocks</HI> and <HI>Herds</HI> were in the <HI>Temple</HI> sold;</L>
<L>Nor is the modern Practice more prophane,</L>
<L>Which in the <HI>Romish</HI> Church they still retain,</L>
<L>Which to each Cut-throat Rascal deigns Relief,</L>
<L>And from the Gallows screens the flying Thief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still on my Muse, and say what various Arts,</L>
<L>What Cheats are practis'd on unthinking Hearts;</L>
<L>When in full <HI>Balls,</HI> in dazzling Splendor gay,</L>
<L>Their active Limbs and Breeding they display;</L>
<L>With Antick Airs they speed their Steps around,</L>
<L>And to the Fiddles foot the trembling Ground;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="21"/>While, as sublime with airy Feet they fly,</L>
<L>The jaunty Whalebone shews the naked Thigh,</L>
<L>The Damask Shoe, enrich'd with curious Art,</L>
<L>And Scarlet Stocking pierce the Coxcomb's Heart;</L>
<L>Charm'd with her pretty Shape and swimming Air,</L>
<L>He swears that <HI>Venus</HI> is not half so fair;</L>
<L>How quick her Eyes, how matchless is her Face!</L>
<L>How skilfully she moves! with what a Grace!</L>
<L>On ev'ry Note his wanton Wishes soar,</L>
<L>He smiles and hums a Luscious Sonnet o'er;</L>
<L>While leering she observes his sparkling Eyes,</L>
<L>Drunk with hot Lust, and triumphs in her Prize;</L>
<L>With dimpling Smiles she feeds his young Desires,</L>
<L>And adds new Fuel to his growing Fires:</L>
<L>If with obsequious Posture he advance,</L>
<L>And begs her for his Part'ner in the Dance,</L>
<L>She curt'sies low, is proud of the Command,</L>
<L>And with a seeming Pleasure grants her Hand;</L>
<L>At ev'ry Round, the am'rous Fool to please,</L>
<L>She feels unblushing the lascivious Squeeze;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="22"/>Caught by inveigling Arts and wily Charms,</L>
<L>He throws himself distracted in her Arms;</L>
<L>The ready Priest his Curse with Marriage crowns,</L>
<L>He weds, and in a Fortnight hangs or drowns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why need I mention, to compleat the rest,</L>
<L>How these fair Vermin all our Paths infest,</L>
<L>From Garret Windows, with a wistful Eye,</L>
<L>They mark each single Gown that passes by,</L>
<L>And like Boys gaping at some Raree-Show,</L>
<L>With hireling Toasts the Doors are throng'd below,</L>
<L>In ev'ry publick Walk, in ev'ry Street,</L>
<L>You'll never fail unnumber'd <HI>Belles</HI> to meet,</L>
<L>So many, that should each fond Mother's Son</L>
<L>For <HI>better or for worse</HI> sollicit one,</L>
<L>The <HI>Colleges</HI> would fail, and many a Fair</L>
<L>Must go without a Scholar to her Share.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="23"/>Backwards and forwards to the neighb'ring Shops,</L>
<L>Censorious <HI>P—ne</HI> in dirty Night-Gown pops,</L>
<L>Herself most free at Female <HI>Freedoms</HI> rails,</L>
<L>And jaunts from Street to Street with Scandal-Tales;</L>
<L>While num'rous others, studious to be seen,</L>
<L>Feign Gossip-Errands and divert the Spleen:</L>
<L>Ambling they trip by ev'ry <HI>College</HI>-Gate,</L>
<L>To pick up straggling Hearts and mend their ragged Fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cease, gentle Youths, unjustly to complain,</L>
<L>That the Nymph's cruel and you sigh in vain;</L>
<L>Alas! with pitying Ears they hear you moan,</L>
<L>And for one single Asking, are your own,</L>
<L>Nay, oft, if bashful and reserv'd you prove,</L>
<L>They'll ev'n ask first and humbly court your Love.</L>

<L>But fly, Oh! fly from their destructive Charms,</L>
<L>Fly from th' Embraces of their op'ning Arms;</L>

<L>Your ruin'd Fame and your abandon'd Fate.</L>

<LG>
<L>I know a Youth, whom not ignobly born,</L>
<L>His careful Sire (to polish and adorn</L>
<L>His tender artless Mind) to <HI>College</HI> sent;</L>
<L>He came, and, oh! behold the dire Event!</L>
<L>New from the Rod, and Stranger to Mankind,</L>
<L>Each fair Appearance won his easy Mind;</L>
<L>As yet Experience had not fledg'd his Wings,</L>
<L>But, as they seem'd, he judg'd of Men and Things:</L>
<L>Thus ev'ry <HI>Puritan</HI> with him was pure,</L>
<L>And to be Pious was to be Demure:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="25"/>With him each glaring Female was divine,</L>
<L>Gay were the Tawdry, and the Shewy fine;</L>
<L>Thoughtless and unsuspecting of Deceit,</L>
<L>Thro' the dark Guise he could not see the Cheat.</L>
<L>When now but a few Moons had pass'd away,</L>
<L>To Female Cunning he became a Prey;</L>
<L>On a proud dainty Quean he casts his Eyes,</L>
<L>And Fires, 'till then unknown, within his Breast arise.</L>
<L>At first with Coldness, politickly coy,</L>
<L>The sly young Baggage shunn'd the whining Boy;</L>
<L>If he desir'd the favour of a Kiss,</L>
<L>With seeming Passion she deny'd the Bliss;</L>
<L>From his warm Lips she oft withdrew her Hand,</L>
<L>For so did the old Mother-Crone at home command.</L>
<L>Her artful Coyness doubled his Desires,</L>
<L>And blow'd thro' ev'ry Vein the spreading Fires.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="26"/>At length by slow degrees, in Treachery skill'd,</L>
<L>She grows more pliant, and begins to yield;</L>
<L>With some Respect she now receives his Suit,</L>

<L>While he to vicious idle Courses takes,</L>
<L>His <HI>Logick-Studies</HI> and his Pray'rs forsakes;</L>
<L>Pufft up with Love, a studious Life he loaths,</L>
<L>And places all his Learning in his Cloaths;</L>
<L>He <HI>Smarts,</HI> he Dances, at the Ball is seen,</L>
<L>And struts about the Room with saucy Mien.</L>
<L>In vain his <HI>Tutor,</HI> with a watchful Care,</L>

<L>In vain his <HI>Friends</HI> endeavour to controul</L>
<L>The stubborn, fatal Byass of his Soul;</L>
<L>In vain his <HI>Father</HI> with o'erflowing Eyes,</L>
<L>And mingled Threatnings, begs him to be Wise;</L>
<L>His Friends, his Tutor, and his Father fail,</L>
<L>Nor Tears, nor Threats, nor Duty will prevail;</L>
<L>His stronger Passions urge him to his Fall,</L>

<L><PB N="17" REF="27"/>In Wedlock-Sheets he stains his gen'rous Birth,</L>

<L>The well-known Signal to the welcome Spark.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean while the frugal Mother sits at home,</L>
<L>And mourns to find no youthful Lovers come;</L>
<L>Year after Year with fruitless Hope she waits,</L>
<L>None dare to venture on the cheapest Rates;</L>
<L>In vain she ope's her Doors and bids us chuse,</L>
<L>All, all her boasted Penny-worths refuse;</L>
<L>In vain each common Stratagem she tries,</L>
<L>Extols one's Gesture, and another's Eyes;</L>
<L>In vain at Church on Sundays they appear,</L>
<L>Trudge round the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Publick Walk.</NOTE> Parks, and thro' the Windows leer;</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="51"/>In vain each Ev'ning at the Door they stand,</L>
<L>Not one goes off;—ev'n <HI>Patty</HI> sticks at Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fond thoughtless Parent! e'er it be too late,</L>
<L>Thy Childrens boundless Vanities abate,</L>
<L>Teach them to drive Ambition from their Breast,</L>
<L>And in their own Obscurity to rest;</L>
<L>Strip 'em of all their unbecoming Pride,</L>
<L>The strutting Whalebone let 'em lay aside,</L>
<L>Let 'em their gew-gaw Fopperies reduce,</L>
<L>Unpatch their Faces, and unlace their Shoes,</L>
<L>Dismiss the Toilet and the Dressing-Box,</L>
<L>And humbly be content with Dowlas Smocks,</L>
<L>Be clad in Linsy-woolsy plain and tight,</L>
<L>And for blue Aprons let 'em change their white.</L>
<L>Send 'em to Service in some Farmer's Yard,</L>
<L>For their own Living let the Jades work hard,</L>
<L>Let 'em go feed the Hogs, and milk the Cows,</L>
<L>Wash, scower, and brew, and daily sweep the House</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="52"/>Or if they rather chuse the Nuptial Bed,</L>
<L>Let 'em some honest homely Rustick wed;</L>
<L>Numbers of russet Farmers may be found,</L>
<L>That want in Marriage-Fetters to be bound,</L>
<L>Those let 'em take, to those resign their Charms,</L>
<L>And riot in their sinewy clasping Arms.</L>
<L>Thus unaspiring let 'em lead their Lives,</L>
<L>And dream no more of being Parsons Wives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amongst our TOASTS, each Scoundrel has a Place,</L>
<L>If she be proud, and has a Moppet-Face;</L>
<L>If but her Voice is languishing and soft,</L>
<L>If she treads firm, or bears her Neck aloft;</L>
<L>If her Waist lessens and her Breasts swell high,</L>
<L>Has a small pretty Foot, a wanton Eye;</L>
<L>If she can dress and paint and laugh and chat,</L>
<L>If she can dance, romp, frolick, and all that;</L>
<L>If she be black, or brown, or flaxen-fair,</L>
<L>If careless, and if negligent her Air,</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="53"/>Or if her Skin be white, or Cloaths be fine,</L>
<L>The Woman is of Consequence divine:</L>
<L>Thus <HI>F-dd-s,</HI> and thus <HI>H—y—d</HI> are admir'd,</L>
<L>And thousands are with <HI>L-w</HI> and <HI>H-mm-d</HI> fir'd;</L>
<L>Hence <HI>N-l-n, W—ght</HI> and <HI>H-rr-s</HI> rose to Fame,</L>
<L>And servile <HI>Br—ks</HI> hence grew a noted Name;</L>
<L>A thousand more with Ease I could rehearse,</L>
<L>But who would, put such sordid Names in Verse;</L>
<L>Crack'd Chambermaids and common Strumpets some,</L>
<L>Bar-keepers, Sempstresses and God knows whom,</L>
<L>Names ev'n beneath the vilest <HI>Grubstreet</HI> Prose,</L>
<L>Who from the Loins of vagrant Gypsies rose;</L>
<L>Or whom, perhaps, the pedling Mother-whore,</L>
<L>Dropt secretly at the Churchwarden's Door;</L>
<L>I pass in Silence all the Rubbish-Train,</L>
<L>Nurs'd in the filthy Stews of <HI>Bullock</HI>'s-<HI>Lane.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if some waspish Critick should accuse</L>
<L>Of canker'd Prejudice the railing Muse,</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="54"/>Least he should think that I'm to love a Foe,</L>
<L>Some sapless Dotard, or demolish'd Beau,</L>
<L>That at the Sex maliciously I strike,</L>
<L>And hate all Women equally alike;</L>
<L>False were the Charge; for Love's my constant Guest,</L>
<L>And reigns a Lordly Tyrant in my Breast,</L>
<L>Love does my ev'ry other Thought controul,</L>
<L>And is the Master-Passion of my Soul,</L>
<L>In Love each Golden Minute I employ,</L>
<L>And in my LAURA center all my promis'd Joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor do I all our <HI>Oxford</HI> Dames despise,</L>
<L>For who, uncharm'd, can look on <HI>Jenning</HI>'s Eyes?</L>
<L>In whom a thousand various Charms I find,</L>
<L>Her Form is lovely, lovelier is her Mind,</L>
<L>By Nature soft, and spotless as the Dove,</L>
<L>She burns in all the Sanctity of Love;</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="55"/>Thro' the dark ambient Cloud of vulgar <HI>Toasts,</HI></L>
<L>She shines, and far superiour Glories boasts,</L>
<L>As the bright Diamond on a Dunghil gleams,</L>
<L>And thro' the Rubbish darts its blazing Streams.</L>
<L>In her unite Good-Breeding and good Sense,</L>
<L>A courtly Mien and rural Innocence,</L>
<L>As Morning mild, than highest Noon more bright,</L>
<L>And only LAURA shines with equal Light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Folly and Vice my Indignation raise,</L>
<L>But when I meet with Merit I can praise;</L>
<L>Nay, even when the severest Things I write,</L>
<L>The Cause of beautous Innocence I fight,</L>
<L>Depressing Vice, I raise up Virtue higher,</L>
<L>And who loath <HI>T-rr-l, Jennings</HI> must admire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Excuse, my LAURA, this ill-natur'd Flight,</L>
<L>And judge with Candour, what I sharply write;</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="56"/>Nor think, my Charmer, that I rashly dare,</L>
<L>With impious Verse prophane the virtuous Fair,</L>
<L>Sooner, by Heaven! all Hardships could I feel,</L>
<L>And thro' my Bosom plunge the pointed Steel;</L>
<L>Sooner than such a Thought I could dispense,</L>
<L>I'd rip my Heart and tear the Treason thence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now my promis'd Vengeance is compleat,</L>
<L>No more with Throws of Rage my Pulses beat,</L>
<L>Again my Nature is compos'd to Rest,</L>
<L>And softer Thoughts flow in upon my Breast,</L>
<L>The short-liv'd Storm within is now o'erblown,</L>
<L>And Peace and LAURA repossess their Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A while, Oh! let me lose my self in Love,</L>
<L>Thro' the cool Grotts and silent Mazes rove;</L>
<L>Bear me, oh! bear me to those happy Shades,</L>
<L>Where youthful Poets lodge their Lovesick Maids</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="57"/>There let me haunt the fragrant <HI>Jess'mine</HI> Bow'rs,</L>
<L>And load my Temples with the choicest Flow'rs;</L>
<L>Search ev'ry lympid Brook, and Silver Spring,</L>
<L>And on the Myrtles hear the Linnets sing;</L>
<L>On Beds of blooming Roses let me lye,</L>
<L>While wanton <HI>Cupids</HI> frisk before my Eye;</L>
<L>Then when I sleep, in all her shining Charms,</L>
<L>Let Fancy bring my LAURA to my Arms;</L>
<L>Blest in the golden Dream I'll seize my Joy,</L>
<L>And by Delution all my Senses cloy,</L>
<L>I'll kiss, I'll grasp her, gaze each Beauty o'er,</L>
<L>And lost in Transport, beg to wake no more.</L>
