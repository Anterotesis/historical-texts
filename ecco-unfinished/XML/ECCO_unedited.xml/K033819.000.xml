<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS this is the last Opportunity I shall have of addressing the Public this Year, I think it my Duty to return them my warmest Acknowledgments for their favourable Reception of the following little Piece.</P>
<P>The three principal Characters I met with in a Summer's Expedition; they are neither vamp'd from antiquated Plays, pilfer'd from <HI>French</HI> Farces, nor the baseless Beings of the Poet's Brain. I have given them in their plain natural Habit; they wanted no dramatic Finish∣ing; nor can I claim any other Merit than grouping them together, and throw∣ing them into Action. The Justice done
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
them there by the Performers, has been too strongly distinguish'd by the Town, to render any thing from me necessary: I could only wish that the Managers of the Theatres would employ Mr. <HI>Castallo,</HI> whose peculiar <HI>Naiveté,</HI> and strict Pro∣priety, would greatly become many Cha∣racters on our Stage.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written and spoke by Mr. FOOTE.</BYLINE>
<L>HAPPY my Muse, had she first turn'd her Art,</L>
<L>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Humour's dangerous Path, to touch the Heart.</L>
<L>They, who in all the Blust<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Blank Verse,</L>
<L>The mournful Tales of Love, and War, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehearse;</L>
<L>Are sure the Critics C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsure to escape,</L>
<L>You hiss not Heroes now, you only—gape.</L>
<L>Nor, (Strangers quite to Her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, Kings, and Queens,)</L>
<L>Dare you intrude, your Judgment, on their Scenes.</L>
<L>A different Lot the Comic Muse attends,</L>
<L>She is oblig'd, to treat you with your Friends;</L>
<L>Must search the Court, the Forum, and the City;</L>
<L>Mark out the Dull, the Gallant and the Witty,</L>
<L>Youth's wild Profusion, th' Avarice of Age;</L>
<L>Nay, bring the Pit itself, upon the Stage.</L>
<L>First to the Bar, she turns her various Face;</L>
<L>Hem, my Lord, I am Council in this Case,</L>
<L>And if so be, your Lordship should think sit,</L>
<L>Why to be sure, my Client must submit;</L>
<L>For why, because—then off she trips again,</L>
<L>And to the Sons of Commerce, shifts her Scene:</L>
<L>There, whilst the griping Sire, with mopeing Care,</L>
<L>Defrauds the World, himself, t' enrich his Heir,</L>
<L>The pious Boy, his Father's Toil rewarding,</L>
<L>For Thousands throws a Main at <HI>Covent Garden.</HI></L>
<L>These are the Portraits we're oblig'd to show;</L>
<L>You all are Judges if they're like or no:</L>
<L>Here should we sail, some other Shape we'll try,</L>
<L>And grace our future Scenes, with Novelty.</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>
I have a Plan to treat you with <HI>Burletta,</HI></L>
<L>That cannot miss your Taste, <HI>Mia Spilletta.</HI></L>
<L>But should the following Piece your Mirth excite,</L>
<L>From Nature's Volume, we'll persist to write.</L>
<L>Your partial Favour, bad us first proceed;</L>
<L>Then <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>are th' Offender, since you urg'd the Deed.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Choice, Dear <HI>Dick,</HI> is very little concern'd in the Matter: And to convince you that Love is not the Minister of my Counsels, know, that I never saw but once the Object of my present Purpose; and that too at a Time, and in a Circumstance, not very likely to stamp a favourable Impres∣sion. What think you of a raw Boarding-School Girl at <HI>Lincoln</HI> Minster, with a Mind unpolish'd, a Figure uninform'd, and a Set of Features tainted with the Colours of her un∣wholesome Food?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>No very engaging Object indeed, <HI>Hartop.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Thoughts now were mine then: But some Connections I have since had with her Father, have given Birth to my present Design upon her: You are no Stranger to the Situation of my Circumstances: My Neigh∣bourhood to Sir <HI>Penurious Trifle,</HI> was a suf∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent Motive for his advancing what Money I wanted by way of Mortgage: The hard Terms he impos'd upon me, and the little Regard I have paid to Oeconomy, has made it necessary for me to attempt by some Scheme the Re-establishment of my Fortune. This young Lady's Simplicity, not to call it Igno∣rance, presented her at once as a proper Sub∣ject for my Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Success to you, <HI>Jack,</HI> with all my Soul! A Fellow of your Spirit and Vivacity, Mankind ought to support for the Sake of themselves. For whatever <HI>Seneca</HI> and the othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> moral Writers may have suggested in Contempt of Riches, it is plain their Maxims were not calculated for the World as it now stands: In Days of Yore, indeed, when Vir∣tue was call'd Wisdom, and Vice, Folly, such Principles might have been encourag'd; but as the present Subjects of our Enquiry are, not what a Man is, but what he has; as to be Rich, is to be wise and virtuous, and to be Poor, ignorant and vicious, I heartily ap∣plaud your Plan!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Observation is but too just. And is it not, <HI>Dick,</HI> a little unaccountable that we who condescend so servilely to copy the Follies and Fopperies of our polite Neigh∣bours, should be so totally averse to an Imi∣tation of their Virtues? In <HI>France,</HI> has he Wealth? is an Interrogation never put 'till they are disappointed in their Inquires after the Birth and Wisdom of a fashionable Fel∣low: But here, How much a Year—Two Thousand.—The Devil! In what County? <HI>Berkshire.</HI> Indeed? God bless us! A happy Dog! How the duce come I to be interested in a Man's Fortune, unless I am his Steward or his Taylor: Indeed Knowledge and Ge∣nius are worth examining into; by those my Understanding may be improv'd, or my Ima∣gination gratify'd; but why such a Man's be∣ing able to eat <HI>Ortolans,</HI> and drink <HI>French</HI> Wine, is to recommend him to my Esteem, is what I can't readily conceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Complaint may with Justice be made of all Imitations: The ridiculous Side is ever the Object imitated. But a Truce to moralizing, and to our Business. Prithee, in the first Place, how can you gain Admittance to your Mistress? And in the second, is the Girl independent of her Father? His Con∣sent, I suppose, you have no Thought of ob∣taining.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some farther Proposals concerning my Estate; such as an Increase of the Mort∣gage,
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
or an absolute Sale, is a sufficient Pre∣tence for a Visit: And as to the Cash, Twenty to my Knowledge; independent too, you Rogue! And besides, an only Child, you know: And then, when Things are done, they can't be undone—And 'tis well it's no worse—and a Hundred such pretty Proverbs, will, it's great Odds, reconcile the old Fel∣low at last. Besides, my Papa <HI>in posse,</HI> has a Foible, which, if I condescend to humour, I have his Soul, my Dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, now you are in Spirits, give me a Portrait of Sir <HI>Penurious;</HI> tho' he is my Neighbour, yet is he so domestic an Animal, that I know no more of him than the common Country Conversation; that he is a thrifty, wary Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very Abstract of Penury! Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> with his transmigrated Stock∣ings, was but a Type of him. For instance, the Barber has the Growth of his and his Daughter's Head once a Year, for shaving the Knight once a Fortnight; his Shoes are made with the Leather of a Coach of his Grand∣father's, built in the Year, One; his Male-Servant is Footman, Groom, Carter, Coach∣man, and Taylor; his Maid employs her lei∣sure Hours in Plain-Work for the Neighbours, which, Sir <HI>Penurious</HI> takes care, as her La∣bour is for his Emolument, shall be as many as possible, by joining with his Daughter in scouring the Rooms, making the Beds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
thus much for his moral Character. Then as to his intellectual, he is a mere <HI>Charte Blanche;</HI> the last Man he is with must afford him Matter for the next he goes to; but a Story is his Idol, throw him in that, and he swal∣lows it; no matter what, raw or roasted, savoury or insipid, down it goes, and up again to the first Person he meets: It is upon this Basis I found my Favour with the Knight, having acquir'd Patience enough to hear his Stories, and equip'd myself with a Quantity sufficient to furnish him; his Manner is in∣deed peculiar, and for once or twice enter∣taining enough. I'll give you a Specimen—Is not that an Equipage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey! Yes, faith, and the Owner, an Acquaintance of mine: Sir <HI>Gregory Ga∣zette,</HI> by <HI>Jupiter!</HI> and his Son <HI>Tim</HI> with him. Now I can match your Knight. He must come this way to the Parlour. We'll have a Scene; but take your Cue; he is a Country Politician.</P>

<P>What, neither the <HI>Gloucester Journal,</HI> nor the <HI>Worcester Courant,</HI> nor the <HI>Northampton Mercury,</HI> nor the <HI>Chester?</HI> Mr. <HI>Jenkins,</HI> I am your humble Servant: A strange Town this, Mr. <HI>Jenkins,</HI> no News stirring, no Papers taken in!

<P>Sir, I am proud to—Well, Sir, and what News? You come from—Pray, Sir, are you a Parliament Man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, indeed, Sir.</P>

<P>Neither, Sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one.</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never trouble my Head about them. An old Fool!</P>

<P>Good Lord! Your Friend, M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Jenkins,</HI> is very close.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir <HI>Gregory,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hartop</HI> is much in the Secrets above; and it becomes a Man so trusted to be wary, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be so, may be so. Won∣derful! Ay, ay, a great Man, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I'll give him a better Insight into your Character, and that will induce him to throw off his Reserve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be so; do, do; ay, ay!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, <HI>Jack,</HI> don't be so crusty: Indulge the Knight's Humour a little; besides, if I guess right, it may be necessary for the Conduct of your Design to contract a pretty strict Intimacy there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, do as you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir <HI>Gregory,</HI> Mr <HI>Hartop's</HI> Ignorance of your Character made him a little shy in his Replies; but you will now find him more communicative; and, in your Ear,—He is a Treasure; he is in all the Mysteries of Go∣vernment, at the Bottom of every Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wonderful! A Treasure! Ay, may be so.</P>
</SP>

<P>And that you may have him to your∣self I'll go in search of your Son.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>About a hundred and fifty, Sir <HI>Gre∣gory.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good now, good now! And all full, I reckon; full as an Egg; nothing but News! Well, well, I shall go to <HI>London</HI> one of these Days. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hundred and fifty! Won∣derful! And, pray now, which do you reckon the best?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir <HI>Gregory,</HI> they are as various in their Excellencies as their Uses; if you are inclin'd to blacken by a couple of Lines the Reputation of a Neighbour, whose Charac∣ter neither your nor his whole Life can pos∣sibly restore; you may do it for two Shillings in one Paper: If you are displaced, or disap∣pointed of a Place, a Triplet against the Mi∣nistry will be always well receiv'd at the Head of another: And then as a Paper of Morning Amusement, you have the Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Fool! Good lack! And pray who and what may that same Fool be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir <HI>Gregory,</HI> the Author has artfully assumed that Habit, like the royal Jesters of old, to level his Satyr with more Security to himself, and Severity to others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be so, may be so! The Fool! Ha, ha, ha! Well enough! A queer Dog, and no Fool, I warrant you. <HI>Killi∣grew,</HI> ah, I have heard my Grandfather talk much of that same <HI>Killigrew,</HI> and no Fool. But what's all this to News, Mr. <HI>Hartop?</HI> Who gives us the best Account of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the Queen of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and those great Folks? Come now, you could give us a little News if you would; come now!—Snug!—Nobody by. Good now do; come, ever so little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why as you so largely contribute to the Support of the Government, it is but fair you should know what they are about. We are at present in a Treaty with the Pope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Greg.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the Pope! Wonderful! Good now, good now! How, how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are to yield him up a large Tract of the <HI>Terra-Incognita,</HI> together with both the <HI>Needles, Scilly-Rocks,</HI> and the <HI>Lizard-Point,</HI> on Condition that the Pretender has the Government of <HI>Laputa,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Greenland</HI> succeeds to St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Chair; he being, you know, a Protestant, when possessed of the Pontificals, issues out a Bull; com∣manding all Catholicks to be of his Religion, they deeming the Pope infallible, follow his Directions; and then, Sir <HI>Gregory,</HI> we are all of one Mind.</P>
