<HEAD>TO THE
KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS not the least of the Extraordinaries of Your
Majesty's Character, That as you are King of
Your People, so You are the Peoples King.</P>
<P>This Title, as it is the Most Glorious, so is it the
Most Indisputable in the World.</P>
<P>God himself appointed, the Prophet proclaim'd, but
the Peoples assent was the finishing the Royal Authority
of the first King of <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Your Majesty, among all the Blessings of Your Reign,
has restor'd this, as the best of all our Enjoyments, the full
Liberty of Original Right in its Actings and Exercise.</P>
<P>Former Reigns have Invaded it, and the last thought
it totally supprest, but as Liberty revived under Your
Majesty's just Authority, this was the first Flower she
brought forth.</P>
<P>The Author of these Sheets humbly hopes, That what
Your Majesty has so Gloriously Restor'd, what our
Laws and Constitution have Declared and Setled, and
what Truth and Justice openly appears for, he may be
allow'd to Vindicate.</P>
<P>Your Majesty knows too well the Nature of Govern∣ment,
to think it at all the less Honourable, or the more
Precarious, for being Devolv'd from and Center'd in
the Consent of your People.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
The pretence of Patriarchal Authority, had it really
an uninterrupted Succession, can never be supported
against the demonstrated Practice of all Nations; but
being also Devested of the chief Support it might have
had, if that Succession could have been prov'd. The Au∣thority
of Governours <HI>Jure Divino</HI> has sunk Ignomini∣ously
to the Ground, as a preposterous and inconsistent
Forgery.</P>
<P>And yet, if <HI>Vox Populi</HI> be, as 'tis generally allow'd,
<HI>Vox Dei,</HI> Your Majesty's Right to these Kingdoms <HI>Jure
Divino,</HI> is more plain than any of Your Predecessors.</P>
<P>How happy are these Nations, after all the Oppres∣sions
and Tyranny of Arbitrary Rulers, to obtain a King
who Reigns by the universal Voice of the People, and
has the greatest share in their Affections that ever any
Prince enjoy'd, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P>And how vain are the Attempts of a Neighbouring
Prince, to Nurse up a <HI>Contemptible Impostor,</HI> upon the
pretence of Forming a Claim on the Foundation of but
a pretended Succession, against the Consent of the general
Suffrage of the Nation.</P>
<P>To what purpose shall all the Proofs of his Legitimacy
be, <HI>supposing it could be made out,</HI> when the universal
Voice of the People, already express'd in enacted Laws,
shall answer, <HI>We will not have this Man to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>May this Affection of Your Subjects continue to the
latest Hour of Your Life, and may Your Satisfaction be
such as may convince the World, <HI>That the Chiefest Fe∣licity
of a Crown consists in the Affections, as the first Autho∣rity
of it derives from the Consent of the People.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TO THE
Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
AND THE
Commons of England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE vindication of the Original Right of all Men
to the Government of themselves, is so far from a
Derogation from, that it is a Confirmation of your
Legal Authority.</P>
<P>Your Lordships, who are of the Nobility have your Original
Right, your Titles and Dignities from the Greatness of your
Shares in the Freeholds of the Nation: If Merit has raised
any of your Ancestors to distinguishing Honours; or, if the
Royal Favours of Princes has Dignified Families, it has always
been thought fit to bestow or to enable them to Purchase some
Portion of the Freehold of <HI>England</HI> to be annexed to the said
Titles, to make such Dignity rational, as well as to support the
Succession of Honour.</P>
<P>From hence you are Vested with Sovereign Judicature, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
being the properest to be trusted with the Distribution of Justice
in that Country, of which you were supposed to have, and once
had, the principal Propriety.</P>
<P>From hence you sit in Parliament as a Branch of our Con∣stitution,
being part of the Collective Body, representing no
Body but your selves; and as a Testimony that the Original of
all Power Centers in the whole.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
The rest of the Freeholders have Originally a Right to sit
there with you, but being too numerous a Body, they have long
since agreed that whenever the King thinks fit to advise with
his People, they will chuse a certain few out of their Great Body
to meet together with your Lordships.</P>
<P>Here, in short, is the Original of Parliaments; and here,
if Power at any time meet with a Cest of Government, Bi∣shops
and Thrones become Vacant to this Original, all Power of
Course returns. This is the happy Center in the great Circle
of Politick Order.</P>
<P>From hence at the late Revolution, when the King deserted
the Administration, and His present Majesty was in Arms
in <HI>England,</HI> Nature directed the People to have Recourse to
your Lordships, and to desire your Appearance as the Heads of
the great Collective Body; and all the Champions for the great
Arguments of Divine Right could not in that Exigence have
Recourse to one President, nor to One Rule of Proceeding,
but what Nature would have Dictated to the Meanest Judg∣ment,
<HI>viz. That the Nation being left without a Gover∣nour,
the Proprietors should meet to consider of ano∣ther.</HI></P>
<P>And you <HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</HI> who
are the Representatives of your Country, you are this great
Collective Body in Minature, you are an Abridgment of the
many Volumes of the <HI>English</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>To you they have trusted jointly with the King and the
Lords, the Power of making Laws, raising Taxes, and Im∣peaching
Criminals: But how? 'Tis in the Name of all the
<HI>Commons of England,</HI> whose Represenata<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ives you are.</P>
<P>All your Power is yours, as you are a Full and Free Re∣presentative.
I no where attempt to prove what <HI>Powers</HI> you
have not, possibly the Extent of your Legal Authority was
never fully understood, nor have you ever thought fit to Explain
<PB REF="7"/>
it. But this I may be bold to advance, That whatever
<HI>Powers</HI> you have, or may have, you cannot Exercise but in the
Name of the <HI>Commons of England,</HI> and you enjoy them as
their Representative, and for their Vse.</P>
<P>All this is not said to lessen your Authority; Nor can it be
the Interest of any <HI>English Freeholder</HI> to lessen the Authority
of the <HI>Commons</HI> assembled in <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>You are the Conservators of our Liberties, the Expositors of
our Laws, the Levyers of our Taxes, and the Redressors of
our Grievances, the King's best Councellors, and the Peoples
last Refuge.</P>
<P>But if you are Dissolved, for you are not Immortal; or if
you are Deceived, for you are not Infallible; twas never yet
supposed, till very lately, that all <HI>Power</HI> dies with you.</P>
<P>You may Die, but the People remain; you may be Dissolved,
and all immediate Right may cease; Power may have its In∣tervals,
and Crowns their <HI>Interregnum;</HI> but Original Power
cndures to the same Eternity the World endures to: And while
there is People, there may be a Legal Authority Delegated,
though all Succession of Substituted Power were at an End.</P>
<P>Nor have I advanced any new Doctrine, nothing but what
is as ancient as Nature, and born into the World with our
Reason: And I think it would be a Sin against the <HI>Parlia∣ment
of England,</HI> to suggest that they would be offended either
with the Doctrine or with the Author, since 'tis what their own
Authority is built upon, and what the <HI>Laws of England</HI> have
given their assent unto by confirming the Acts of the last
<HI>Collective Body of the People,</HI> from whencethe present Settle∣ment
of the Nation does derive.</P>
<P>Wherefore I make no Apology for Protection or Favour as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Fact; as to Errors of Language I am ready to ask
P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f I offend, declaring my Intention is neither for nor
<PB REF="8"/>
against either Person or Party. As there is but <HI>One Interest</HI>
in the Nation, I wish there were but <HI>One Party,</HI> and that
Party would adhere to Vnbyas'd Justice, and pursue the Ho∣nour
and Interst of the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Eng∣lish
Liberty.</HI></P>

<BODY>
<DIV1>
<PB N="1" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>The Original
RIGHT
OF THE
People of England,
Examined and Asserted.</HEAD>
<P>I Have observ'd, when Interest obliges any Person or Party to
defend the Cause they have Espous'd, they please themselves
with fancying they conceal their Private Designs, by cover∣ing
their Discourses with Gay Titles.</P>
<P>Like a late Act of Parliament, which in the Preamble calls it
self, <HI>An Act for the Relief of Creditors,</HI> but in its Effect was really
<HI>an Act for the Relief of Debtors.</HI></P>
<P>Thus some Gentlemen place fine specious Titles on their Books,
as <HI>Jure Populi Anglicani, A Vindication of the Rights of the Com∣mons
of</HI> England, and a <HI>Vindication of the Rights of the Lords,</HI>
and the like; and with large and high Encomiums upon the
Excellency of our Constitution, treat the levity of some Peoples
Judgments with fine Notions; whereas the true End and Design
is desending the Interest and Party they have Espous'd.</P>
<P>The Defence of the Rights of the Representative Body of the
People, understood by the Name of the Commons of <HI>England</HI> in
Parliament, <HI>is a great Point;</HI> and so plain are their Rights, that
'tis no extraordinary Task to defend them: But for any Man to
advance, that they are so August an Assembly that no Objection
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
ought to be made to their Actions, nor no Reflection upon their
Conduct, though the Fact be true; and that it is not to be exa∣min'd
whether the Thing said be true, but what Authority the
Person speaking has to say it, <HI>is a Doctrine wholly new,</HI> and seems
to me to be a Badge of more Slavery to our own Representative
than ever the People of <HI>England</HI> owes them, or than ever they
themselves expected.</P>
<P>This therefore, together with some Invasions of the Peoples
Rights made publick by several Modern Authors, are the Reasons
why I have adventur'd, <HI>being wholly Disintersted and Vnconcerned
either for Persons or Parties,</HI> to make a short Essay at declaring
the Rights of the People of <HI>England,</HI> not Representatively but Col∣lectively
considered.</P>
<P>And with due Defference to the Representative Body of the
Nation, I hope I may say, <HI>it can be no Dimination of their Rights,</HI>
to assert the Rights of that Body from whom they derive the
Powers and Priviledges of their House, and which are the very
Foundation of their Being. For if the Original Right of the People
be overthrown, the Power of the Representative, which is subse∣quent
and subordinate, must dye of it self.</P>
<P>And because I have to do rather with Reason and the Nature
of the Thing, than with Laws and Precedents, I shall make but
very little use of Authors, and Quotations of Statutes, since Fun∣damentals
and Principles both in Law and Argument, are superiour
to Laws or Examples.</P>
<P>To come directly to what I design in the following Papers, 'tis
necessary to lay down some Maxims, other than what a late<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> Vindication of the Commons.</NOTE> Au∣thor
has furnish'd us with.</P>
<P>1. That <HI>Salas Populi suprema Lex,</HI> all Government, and conse∣quently
our whole Constitution, was originally design'd, and is
maintain'd, for the Support of the Peoples Property, who are
the Governed.</P>
<P>2. That all the Members of Government, whether King, Lords
or Commons, if they Invert the Great End of their Institution,
the Publick Good cease to be in the same Publick Capacity,
<Q><P>“And Power retreats to its Original.”</P>
<P>True Englishman, P. 28.</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="11"/>
3. That no Collective or Representative Body of Men what so∣ever,
in Matters of Politicks any more than Religion, <HI>are or ever
have been Infallible.</HI></P>
<P>4. That Reason is the Test and Touch-stone of Laws, and that
all Law or Power that is Contradictory to Reason, is <HI>ipso facto</HI> void
in it self, and ought not to be obeyed.</P>
<P>These four Generals run through the whole following Discourse.</P>
<P>Some other Maxims less General are the Consequence of these; as,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That such Laws as are agreeable to Reason and Justice
being once made, are binding both to King, Lords and Com∣mons,
either separately, or conjunctively, till they are actually Re∣pealed
in due Form.</P>
<P>That if either of the Three Powers do Dispense with, Suspend, or
otherwise Break any of the known Laws so made, they Injure the
Constitution; and the Power so acting ought to be restrained by the
other Powers not concurring according to what is lately allowed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> Vindication of the Commons.</NOTE>
<HI>That every Branch of Power is designed as a Check upon each other.</HI></P>
<P>But if all the Three Powers should joyn in such an Irregular
Action, the Constitution suffers a Convulsion, Dies, and is Dis∣solved
of Course.</P>
<P>Nor does it suffice to say, That King, Lords and Commons can
do no Wrong, since <HI>the mutual Consent of Parties,</HI> on which that
foolish Maxim is grounded, does not extend to every Action King,
Lords and Commons are capable of doing.</P>
<P>There are Laws which respect the Common Rights of the People,
as they are the Parties to be Governed, and with respect to these the
King can do no Wrong, but all is laid upon his Ministers—-who
are accountable.</P>
<P>And there are Laws which particularly respect the Constitution;
the King, Lords and Commons, as they are the Parties governing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
In this regard each Branch, may Wrong and Oppress the other,
or all together, may do Wrong to the People they are made to
Govern.</P>
<P>The King may Invade the Peoples Properties, and if the Lords
and Commons omit to defend and protect them, <HI>they all do Wrong</HI> by
a tacit approving those Abuses they ought to oppose.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12"/>
The Commons may extend their Power to an exorbitant Degree,
in Imprisoning the Subjects, Dispensing with the <HI>Habaeus Corpus</HI>
Act, giving unlimited Power to their Sergeant to Oppress the People
in his Custody, withholding Writs of Election from Burroughs and
Towns, and several other ways; which if they are not Check'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither by the King or the Lords, <HI>they are altogether Parties to the
Wrong,</HI> and the Subject is apparently injured.</P>
<P>The Lords may Err in Judicature, and deny Justice to the Com∣mons,
or delay it upon Punctillioes and studied Occasions, and if
neither the King nor the Commons take care to prevent it, Delin∣quents
are excused, and Criminals encouraged, <HI>and all are Guilty of
the Breach of Common Justice.</HI></P>
<P>That to prevent this, it is absolutely necessary that in Matters of
dispute the Single Powers should be Governed by the Joint, and that
nothing should so be insisted upon as to break the Correspondence.</P>
<P>And that the Three should be directed by the Law; and where
that is silent, by Reason.</P>
<P>That every Person concern'd in the Law is in his Measure a judge
of the Reason, and therefore in his proper place ought <HI>to be allowed
to give his Reason in Case of Dissent.</HI></P>
<P>That every Single Power has an absolute Negative upon the Acts
of the Other; and if the People, who are without Doors, find Rea∣son
to Object, <HI>they may do it by Petition.</HI></P>
<P>But because under pretence of Petitioning, Seditious and Turbu∣lent
People may soment Disturbances, Tumults and Disorders:
The Subjects Right of Petitioning being yet recogniz'd and pre∣ferv'd,
the Circumstances of such Petitions are regulated by Laws,
as to the Numbers and Qualities of the Persons Petitioning.</P>
<P>But the Laws have no where prescrib'd the Petitioners to any
Form of Words, and therefore no pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of Indecency of Expres∣sion
can be so Criminal as to be destructive of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Constitution; be∣cause,
though it may deserve the Resentment of the Petitioned, yet
it is not an illegal Act, nor a Breach of any Law.</P>
<P>And yet the Representative Body of the People ought not to be
Banter'd or Affronted neither, at the Will and Pleasure of any pri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yate
Person without Doors, who-finds Cause to Petition them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="13"/>
But if any Expression be offensive to the House, it seems Rea∣sonable
that the Persons who are concerned therein should be
requir'd to explain themselves And if upon such Explanation
the House find no Satisfaction as to the particular Affront, they
are at Liberty to proceed as the Law directs; but no otherwise.</P>
<P>And to me, the Silence of the Law in that Case seems to imply,
that rejecting the Petition is a Contempt due to any Indecency
of that Nature, and as much Resentment as the Nature of the
Thing requires: But as to breaking in upon Personal Liberty,
which is a Thing the Law is so tender of, and has made so strong
a Fence about, I dare not affirm 'tis a justifiable Procedure; no,
not in the House of Commons.</P>
<P>It is alledged, That it has been practiced by all Parliaments;
which is to me far from an Argument to prove the Legality of it.</P>
<P>I think it may pass for a Maxim, That a Man cannot be Legally
punish'd for a Crime which there is no Law to prosecute. Now
since there is no Law to prosecute a Man for Indecency of Ex∣pression
in a Petition to the House of Commons, it remains a
Doubt with me how they can be Legally punish'd.</P>
<P>Precedents are of Use to the Houses of Parliament where the
Laws are silent, in Things relating to themselves, and are doubt∣less
a sufficient Authority to act from. But whether any Prece∣dent,
Usage or Custom, of any Body of Men whatever, can
make a Thing Lawful which the Laws have expresly forbid, re∣mains
a Doubt with me.</P>
<P>It were to be wish'd some of our Parliaments would think fit,
at one Time or another, to clear up the Point of the Authority
of the House of Commons, in Case of Imprisoning such as are
not of their House, that having the Matter stated by those who
are the onely Expositors of our Laws, we might be troubled with
no more <HI>Legion Libels,</HI> to tell them what is, or is not, Legal in
their Proceedings.</P>
<P>The Good of the People Governed is the End of all Govern∣ment,
and the Reason and Original of Governours; and upon
this Foundation it is that it has been the Practice of all Nations,
and of this in particular, That if the Male-Administration of
Governours have extended to Tyranny and Oppression, to De∣struction
of Right and Justice, overtlirowing the Constitution,
and abusing the People, the People have thought it Lawful to
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
Reassume the Right of Government into their own Hands, and
to reduce their Governours to Reason.</P>
<P>The present Happy Restoring of our Liberty and Constitution
is owing to this Fundamental Maxim, according to a late Author,
<Q><L>“That Kings when they descend to Tyranny,</L>
<L>Dissolve the Bond, and leave the Subject free.”</L>
<L>True born Englishman, P.</L></Q></P>
<P>If the People are Justifiable in this Procedure against the King,
I hope I small not be Censur'd if I say, That if any one should ask
me, whether they have not the same Right, in the same Cases, against
any of the Three Heads of the Constitution, I dare not answer in
the Negative.</P>
<P>I may be allow'd to suppose any Thing which is possible; and I
will therefore venture to suppose, That in the late King's Reign
the House of Commons, then fitting, had Voted the Restoration
of Popery in <HI>England,</HI> in Compliance with the King's Inclination.</P>
<P>I doubt not but it had been Lawful for the <HI>Grand Juries, Ju∣stices
of the Peace,</HI> and <HI>Free-holders of any County,</HI> or of every
County, to have Petition'd the House of Commons not to pro∣ceed
in giving up their Religion and Laws.</P>
<P>And in Case of Refusal there, they might Petition the House of
Lords not to have Pass'd such a Bill.</P>
<P>And in Case of Refusal there, they might Petition the King,
and put Him in Mind of His Coronation Engagement.</P>
<P>And in Case of Refusal to that Petition, they might Petition
the King again to Dissolve the Parliament, or otherwise to protect
their Liberties and Religion.</P>
<P>And if all these Peaceable Applications fail'd, I doubt not but
they might Associate for their Mutual Defence against any Inva∣sion
of their Liberties and Religion, and apply themselves to any
Neighbouring Power or Potentate for Assistance and Protection.</P>
<P>If this be not true, I can give but a slender Account of our
late Revolution; which nevertheless I think to be founded upon
the exact principles of Reason and Justice.</P>
<P>Nor will the Pretence of Indecency of Expression be any Argu∣ment
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
to bar the Subject of his Right of Petitioning, or justifie
the ill Treatment of such Petitioners: For the Case exceedingly
differs from the supposed Case of the Lord Chancellor, and the
Complaint which a late Author brings, in desiring the Lord Chan∣cellor
<HI>to turn his plausible Speeches into Righteous Decrees.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First</HI> of all, The Freeholders of <HI>England</HI> stand in a different Ca∣pacity
to the Members of the House, who are their <HI>Trustees,</HI> their
<HI>Attorneys,</HI> their <HI>Representatives,</HI> from that of a Complainant in <HI>Chan∣cery</HI>
to the Judge of that Court.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Lord Chancellgr has a Right by Law to Commit
for personal Affronts offered in Court: Whether the House of Com∣mons
have the same Right by Law I know not, nor will not under∣take
to determine; but I do not find that Worthy Member has yet
attempted to prove they have.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly;</HI> This is Arguing from the Inferiour Court to the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>England,</HI> which is directly against Sir <HI>H. M.</HI>'s late Position,
<HI>Fol.</HI> 4. where he had, as I suppose, forgot that he had laid us down
this Rule.</P>
<P>“When there is Occasion to Debate concerning these Superiour Powers
of King, Lords and Commons, we mast not argue like Lawyers in
<HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> from the narrow Foundation of private Canses
of <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum;</HI> but like Statesmen and Senators, from the
Large and Noble Foundation of Govesnment, and the general Good
of the King and People.”</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> But I am also informed, that the Case is wrong too,
and that even in that Instance: The Lord Chancellor had no Power
to Commit to the <HI>Fleet,</HI> unless it were an Affront, <HI>Viva Voce,</HI> in Court.</P>
<P>Nor would it be any Argument in the supposed Case I am upon,
for any Body to say, That the Occasion must concern that part of
the Country from whence such Petition is brought: for the Intro∣ducing
of Popery would certainly concern every County of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And suppose again, the People thought themselves in danger of
an Invasion from <HI>France,</HI> and thereupon the Counties of <HI>Kent</HI> and
<HI>Sussex</HI> should have Petitioned the House to take them into Conside∣ration,
who, in such Case, were like to be the Seat of the war,
and first Exposed to the Enemy; Would any Body say, the Occa∣sion
did not arise in the C unty from whence such Petition did
proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16"/>
In this <HI>Universal Right of the People</HI> consists Our general Safety:
For notwithstanding all the Beauty of our Constitution, and the
exact Symetry of its Parts, about which some have been so very
Elegant, <HI>this noble well-contrived S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stem has been Overwhelmed;</HI> the
Government has been Inverted, the Peoples Liberties have been
trampled on, and Parliaments have been rendred useless and insig∣nificant:
And <HI>what has restored us?</HI> The last Resorrt has been to the
People; <HI>Vox Dei has been found there,</HI> not in the Representatives,
but in their Original the <HI>Represented.</HI></P>
<P>And what has been the Engine that has led the Nation to it?
The Reason and Nature of the Thing. Reason governs Men when
they are Masters of their Sences, as naturally as Fire flies upwards,
or Water descends.</P>
<P>For what is it that King, Lords and Commons assemble? 'Tis
to Reason together concerning the weighty Matters of the State,
and to Act and Do for the Good of the People, what shall be agree∣able
to Reason and Justice</P>
<P>I grant 'tis reasonable that every Branch should be vested with
due Powers, and those Powers be equally distributed.</P>
<P>But if they must be vested with Power, some Body must rest
them with it: If these Powers must be distributed, some Body must
distribute them. So that</P>
<P>There must be some Power <HI>Prior</HI> to the Power of King, Lords
and Commons, from which, as the Streams from the Fountain, the
Power of King, Lords and Commons is derived.</P>
<P>And what are all the different Terms which Statesmen turn so
often into fine Words to serve their Ends; as, <HI>Reason of State, Pub∣lick

who yet would be Opposers of this Doctrine, say, <HI>when it serves
their turn,</HI> that all the Great Offices which have the Title of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
annexed to them, ought to be Nominated and Approved by
the People of <HI>England,</HI> as the High Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> High
Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> and the like.</P>

That Power which is Original, is Superior; <HI>God is the Foun∣tain
of all Power, and therefore is the Supreme:</HI> And if we could sup∣pose
a Prior and Original of the Divine Power, <HI>that Original would
be God,</HI> and be Superiour; for all subsequent Power must be sub∣ject
and inferiour to the precedent.</P>
<P>The Power vested in the Three Heads of our Constitution is
vested in them by the People of <HI>England,</HI> who were a People before
there was such a thing as a Constitution.</P>
<P>And the Nature of the Thing, is the Reason of the Thing: It was
vested in them by the People, because the People were the only Original
of their Power, being the only Power Prior to the Constitution.</P>
<P>For the publick Good of these People, a Constitution and Govern∣ment
was Originally Formed; from the mutual Consent of these
people the Powers and Authorities of this Constitution are derived:
And for the preservation of this Constitution, and enabling it to an∣swer
the Ends of its Institution in the best manner possible, those
Powers were divided.</P>
<P>The Second Maxim is a Rational Natural Consequence of the
former, That at the <HI>final, Casual, or any other</HI> Determination of
this Constitution, the Powers are Dissolv'd, and all Authority
must derive <HI>de novo</HI> from the first Fountain, Original and Cause
of all Constitutions, <HI>the Governed.</HI></P>
<P>Now it cannot be suppos'd this Original Fountain should give
up all its Waters, but that it reserves a Power of supplying the
Streams: Nor has the Streams any power to turn back upon the
Fountain, and invert its own Original. All such Motions are Ex∣centrick
and Unnatural.</P>
<P>There must always remain a Supream Power in the Original to
supply, in Case of the Dissolution of Delegated Power.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>England</HI> have Delegated all the Executive Power
<HI>in the King,</HI> the Legislative in the <HI>King, Lords and Commons,</HI> the
Soveraign Judicature <HI>in the Lords,</HI> the Remainder is reserv'd in them∣selves,
and not committed, no not to their Representatives: All
Powers Delegated are to one Great End and Purpose, and no
other, and that is <HI>the Publick Good.</HI> If either or all the Branches
to whom this Power is Delegated invert the Design, the End of
their Power, the Right they have to that Power ceases; and
they become Tyrants and Usurpers of a Power they have no
Right to.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="18"/>
The Instance has been visible as to Kings in our Dayes; and
History is full of Precedents in all Ages, and in all Nations; par∣ticularly
in <HI>Spain,</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> in <HI>Swedeland,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and in
<HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>But in <HI>England,</HI> the late Revolution is a particular Instance of
the Exercise of this Power.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> on the Approach of a Foreign Army, and the ge∣neral
recourse of the People to Arms, fled out of the Kingdom.
What must the People of <HI>England</HI> do? They had no Reason to
run after him to be Govern'd there; there was no Body to call a
Parliament, so the Constitution was entirely Dissolved.</P>
<P>The Original of Power, <HI>the People,</HI> Assembled in Convention,
to consider of Delegating New Powers for their future Govern∣ment,
and accordingly made a New Settlement of the Crown, a
New Declaration of Right, and a New Representative of the
People; <HI>and some have thought they ought to have given a New
Sanction to all precedent Laws.</HI></P>
<P>It remains to argue from hence, But what Course must the
People of <HI>England</HI> take, if their Representatives exercise the Power
intrusted with them, to the Ruine of the Constitution?</P>
<P>It has been advanced, That every Man must submit, and not
presume to argue against it upon any Supposition of Mismanage∣ment.</P>
<P>I
can see no Reason given to confirm such a Position; for unless
we will place the Original of Power in the persons Representing,
not in the persons Represented, it cannot be made out that there
ought to be no Complaint upon the score of Mismanagement.
It is not the Design of this Discourse to lessen the Authority of
Parliament: But all Power must Centre some where. If it is in the
Three Branches of the Conftitution, 'tis there inherently and origi∣nally,
or it is there by Deputation. If it be there by Deputation,
then there must be a Power Deputing, and that must be both <HI>Prtor,</HI>
and consequently Superiour to the Deputed, <HI>as before.</HI></P>
<P>If we will come off of this, we must fly to the old weak Resuge
of a Power <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> a Doctrine which the most samed Pre∣tenders
to, have lived to be ashamed of; and whole Foundation is so
weak, that 'tis not worth while to Expose it.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="19"/>
I should therefore have been very glad, that for the Perfecting
the Defence of the <HI>English</HI> Constitution, the Gentlemen who have
begun so well, would have gone forward to Recognize the Power of
the People of <HI>England,</HI> and their undoubted Right to judge of the
Infractions made in their Constitution, by either Parties abusing the
particular Powers vested in them; and inverting them, by turning
them against the People they are designed to defend.</P>
<P>That they would have stated fairly what the People of <HI>England</HI>
are to do, if their Representatives shall hereafter betray the Liber∣ties
or Religion of the People they are intrusted with the De∣fence
of.</P>
<P>What by the Laws of Nature and Reason is to be expected, and
what by the Laws of our Constitution are allowed.</P>
<P>To say, It cannot be supposed the House of Commons can ever
betray their Trust, is a Compliment: No Man is bound to make
them, <HI>Humanum est Errare.</HI> We have seen Parliaments Err, and do
what succeeding Parliaments have thought fit to undoe: <HI>And as
that which has been may be, so that may be which never has been before.</HI></P>
<P>We have seen Parliaments comply with Kings to the Ruine of the
Nation; and we have seen Parliaments Quarrel with Kings, to the
Overturning of the Constitution, Dissolving the House of Lords, and
Suppressing the Monarchy.</P>
<P>We have seen Parliaments concur so with the Fate and Fortunes
of Princes, as to comply backward and forward, in Deposing and
Reinthroning alternately two Kings as often as Victory put power
into their Hands, I mean <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, and <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth,
who were Kings and Prisoners five or six times, and always the
Parliament complied with the Conquerors.</P>
<P>We have seen a Parliament of <HI>England</HI> confirm the Usurpation
of <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, the greatest Tyrant and most bloody Man
that ever <HI>England</HI> brought forth.</P>
<P>We have seen a <HI>Parliament</HI> confirm <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, who really
had no Right at all by Succession, and Rescind all the precedent
<HI>Parliament</HI> had done.</P>
<P>Afterwards, in Matters of Religion, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth made
a <HI>Popish Parliament</HI> pull down the Supremacy of <HI>Rome,</HI> and set up
the King's; and afterwards suppress all the Religious Houses in the
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
Nation. His Son pulled up Popery by the Roots, and planted the
Reformation, <HI>still the Parliament complied.</HI> Queen <HI>Mary</HI> Re-esta∣blished
Popery, and unravelled both the Reformation of King
<HI>Edward,</HI> and all the Acts both of Church and State relating to her
Mother's Divorce, <HI>and still the Parliament consented.</HI> One <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI>
Voted Queen <HI>Mary</HI> Legitimate, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> a Bastard:
Another <HI>Parliament</HI> Legitimated Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and Repudiated
Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> undid all her Sister had done, and
suppress'd all the proceedings of Popery; and <HI>all was by Authority
of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>So that this Parliamentary Branch of Power is no more Infallible
than the Kingly.</P>
<P>Had Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> gone on to have Recogniz'd the Peoples Right,
to preserve their own Liberties in case of faiulure in any, or in all the
Branches of the Constituted Power, he had compleated his <HI>Vindi∣cation
of the Commons of England,</HI> which no Man could have done
better than himself.</P>
<P>If then upon the Subversion of the Laws, and Interruption of
Common Justice, the Center of Power is in the People, <HI>a Fortiori.</HI>
The People are also concerned in every Degree of such a Subversion.</P>
<P>And 'tis the most reasonable thing in the World, that those who
upon a total Subversion are the Sufferers, and have a Right to the
Re-establishment, should have a Right to take Cognifance of any
Degree of Invasion made upon their Right, and which tends to that
general Subversion.</P>
<P>'Twould be Nonsence to suppose, that which has all the Greater
Powers should not have the Less.</P>
<P>Can the Peoples Good be the main and only End of Government,
and the Peoples Power be the last Resort when Government is
Overwhelmed by the Errors of Governors? and have these People
no Right, not so much as to be sensible of the Ruine of their Liber∣ties,
till it is absolutely compleated? 'Twould be ridiculous.</P>
<P>The truth is in right Reasoning, the first Invasion made upon
Justice, either by the tacit or actual Assent of the three Heads of our
Constitution, is an actual Dissolution of the Constitution; and, for
ought I can fee, the People have a right to dispossess the Incumbent,
and commit the Trust of Government, <HI>de Nova,</HI> upon that first
Act.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="21"/>
But I chuse rather to put the Argument upon total Subversions of
right Order and Defence, and I am sure no Body will dispute it
with me there.</P>
<P>And here, if I have any foresight, lies an absolute Security for us
against that Bug-bear, which so many pretend to be frighted at <HI>a
Commonwealth.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Genius</HI> of this Nation has always appear'd to tend to a Mo∣narchy,
a legal limited Monarchy; and having had in the late Re∣volution
a full and uninterrupted Liberty, to Cast themselves into
what Form of Government they pleas'd: There was not discover∣ed
the least Inclination in any Party towards a <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> tho'
the Treatment they met with from their last two Kings, had all in
it that could be, to put them out of Love with Monarchy.</P>
<P>A Commonwealth can never be introduc'd, but by such Invasions
of Right as must make our present Constituted Government impra∣cticable:
The Reason is, because Men never willingly change for the
Worst; and the People of <HI>England</HI> enjoy more Freedom in our Regal,
than any People in the World can do ina Popular Government.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>England</HI>' can never chuse a Commonwealth Go∣vernment,
till they come to desire less Liberty than they now enjoy;
that is, till they come to be blind to their own Interest. 'Tis true,
Example is no Argument; but I might freely Appeal to the Friends
of the Last Republick in <HI>England</HI> to answer this Question.</P>
<P>Whether the People of <HI>England,</HI> during the short Government of
Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> which was erroneously called a Common∣wealth,
did, or whether they can under any Commonwealth Go∣vernment,
founded never so wisely, enjoy greater Privileges and Ad∣vantages
than under the present Constitution in its full and free Ex∣ercise,
uninterrupted by the Excesses of Kings evil Councellors, Par∣ties
and Passions.</P>
<P>If any shall pretend that the late Parliament is aimed at in this, I
hope I may have as much liberty to suppose they are Mistaken; <HI>for
the Days of Judging by</HI> Inuendo <HI>are at an end.</HI></P>
<P>If any thing seem to lie that way, the Error must be theirs who
have so mean thoughts of them, as to think the Coat will fit them;
<HI>if it does, they are welcome to wear it.</HI> For my part, I declare my
self to intend only the bringing things to such a right Understand∣ing,
as may preserve the Ballance of Power; and, I hope, I can∣not
offend any Free Representative of the People of <HI>England,</HI> in
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
saying, that What Power they have they receive from the People they
represent; and, That some Powers do still remain with the People, which
they never neither diverted themselves of, nor committed to them.</P>
<P>Nor can I be sensible of offending if I say, that '<HI>Tis possible for
even a House of Commons to be in the Wrong.</HI> 'Tis possible for a
House of Commons to be misled by Factions and Parties. 'Tis pos∣sible
for them to be Brib'd by Pensions and Places, and by either of
these Extreams to betray their Trust, and abuse the People who en∣trust
them: And if the People should have no Redress in such a
Case, then were the Nation in the hazard of being ruined by their
own Representatives. And 'tis a wonder to find it asserted in a
certain Treatise, <HI>That it is not to be supposed that ever the House of
Commons can Injure the People who intrust them.</HI> There can be no
better way to demonstrate the possibility of a thing, than by proving
that it has been already.</P>
<P>And we need go no farther back than to the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI>
the Second, in which we have seen Lists of 180 Members who re∣ceived
private Pensions from the Court; and if any Body shall ask
whether that Parliament preserv'd the Ballance of Power in the
three Branches of our Constitution, in the due distribution some have
mentioned, <HI>I am not afraid to answer in the Negative.</HI></P>
<P>And why even to this day are Gentlemen so fond of spending their
Estates to sit in that House, that Ten thousand Pounds has been
spent at a time to be Chosen, and now that way of procuring Ele∣ctions
is at an end, <HI>private Briberies</HI> and Clandestine Contrivances
are made use of to get into the House. <HI>No Man would give a Groat
to sit where he cannot get a Groat honestly for sitting, unless there were
either Parties to gratifie, Profits to be made, or Interest to support.</HI></P>
<P>If then these things are possible, it seems to me not so improper
for the People, who are the Original and End of the Constitution, and
have the main Concern in it, to be very sollicitous that the due Bal∣lance
of Power be preserv'd, and decently; and, according to Law,
always to shew their Dislike and Resentment at any publick En∣croachment,
which either Branch of the Constitution, shall make
on each other, or on the whole, be it by their own Representatives
or any where else.</P>
<P>If it is expected, that I should descend to particular Matters, de∣bated
between the two Houses in the last Session of this present Par∣liament;
such Expectants will be deceived: I shall not meddle
with a Case which appears so difficult to be decided, that the two
Houses of Parliament could not agree about.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23"/>
And since, as I said before, every Person who takes upon him to
speaks to or of the Parliament, ought to have liberty to Explain
himself; so I have taken that Liberty in the Preface to this Book,
to which I refer. But this in General I may say, for I am upon
Generals, and shall keep to them without any relation to particular
Cases.</P>
<P>It cannot be that the <HI>People of England,</HI> who have so much Con∣cern
in the good Agreement of their Governours, can see the Two
Houses of Parliament at any time Clash with one another, or with
the King, or the King with them; or Encroach upon the Rights and
Liberties of the Subjects, and be Unconcern'd and not express their
Fears.</P>
<P>If any Fellow Subject be Impeach'd, to see the Disputes between
the Two Houses about Punctilioes of Form, interrupt the due and
ordinary Course of justice; so that a Criminal cannot be Detected,
nor an Innocent Man be Justified, but such Impeachments shall
lie as a Brand upon the Reputation of an Innocent Person, <HI>which
is a Punishment worse than his Crime deserv'd, if he were Guilty:</HI>
These are Injuries to the Subject in general, and they cannot be easie
to see them.</P>
<P>We have a great Cry against an Evil Ministry, the noise of which
is so great, as it drowns the Complaints of the People; but I dare
say none of the People of <HI>England</HI> would be against having due Re∣sentments
shown, and legal Punishments inflicted with impartial Ju∣stice,
where the Persons appear Guilty: But if Enquity after Dis∣orders
at Home should delay taking care of our Safety Abroad; if
private Clashings and Disputes between Parties and Interests should
take up the Hours which are due to the Emergency of Foreign
Affairs, the People of <HI>England</HI> will be very ill serv'd; and the Per∣sons,
whoever they are concerned, will be able to give but a sorry
account to the Country that employ'd them of the Trust they had
committed to them: Not that Delinquents should not be Punish'd,
or Evil Ministers Impeach'd, but, as our Saviour says in another
Case, <HI>These things ye ought to have done, and not have the other left
undone.</HI></P>
<P>What shall we then say to the manner of fixing Guilt upon a
Person or a Party by Vote. That the Lords denying a free Con∣ference
was a Delay of Justice, and tended to destroy the good Cor∣respondence,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and refusing to proceed to the Tryal of one Im∣peach'd
Lord, because another Lord, not Impeach'd, had affronted
the House.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="24"/>
Truly I shall venture to say nothing of it but this, That the Clash∣ings
and Disagreement between the two Houses are things our Ene∣mies
rejoyc'd at, and the People of <HI>England</HI> were very sorry for.
Who are in the right of it Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> must answer for me, who says,
<HI>It is not to be imagin'd that a Majority of so numerous a Body of Gen∣tlemen
can be influenc'd against Reason and Justice.</HI> But at the same
time supposes the Lords may, by receiving Articles of Impeachment
to Day, and appointing to Try them Forty Years hence, or else to
morrow Morning at <HI>Traro</HI> in <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P>If he means that it is not probable, I readily allow it; but if he
means that 'tis not possible, I cannot agree, for the Reasons and Ex∣amples
aforesaid: And if it be but possible, 'tis not reasonable the
Liberty and Safety of <HI>England</HI> should be exposed even to a possibi∣lity
of a Disaster; and therefore Reason and Justice allows, that
when all Delegated Powers fail or expire, when Governours de∣vour
the People they should protect; And when Parliaments, <HI>if
ever that unhappy time shall come again,</HI> should be either destroy'd,
or, which is as bad, be Corrupted, and betray the People they Re∣present,
the People themselves, who are the Original of all Dele∣gated
Power, have an undoubted Right to defend their Lives, Li∣berties,
Properties, Religion and Laws, against all manner of In∣vasion
or Treachery, be it Foreign or Domestick; the Constitution
is Dissolv'd, and the Laws of Nature and Reason act of Course, ac∣cording
to the late Author quoted before.</P>
<Q><L>“The Government's ungirt when Justice dies,</L>
<L>And Constitutions are <HI>non Entities:</HI></L>
<L>The Nation's all a Mob; there's no such thing</L>
<L>As Lords and Commons, Parliament or King.</L>
<L>A great promiscuous Croud the <HI>Hydra</HI> lies,</L>
<L>Till Laws revive and mutual Contract ties,</L>
<L>A <HI>Chaos</HI> free to chuse for their own share</L>
<L>What Case of Government they please to wear.</L>
<L>If to a King they do the Reins commit,</L>
<L>All Men are bound in Conscience to submit.</L>
<L>But then that King must by his Oath assent</L>
<L>To Postalata's of the Government:</L>
<L>Which if he breaks he cuts off the Intail,</L>
<L>And Power retreats to its Original.—”</L></Q>
<Q>True English-Man, p. 47.</Q>
<P>It may be Objected; But who are these People to whom Power must
thus Retreat? And who have the Original Right in their Hands? It
must be the whole People. If there be one Negative, every one having
an equal Right, the real Claim of Power is Imperfect: And since there
can be no general Collective Meeting of the whole Community, there can
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
be no Execution of their Power; and therefore this does not justifie a
few of that Body in the name of the rest, to Execute any part of
that Power.</P>
<P>This may be Answered; though upon a Dissolution of Govern∣ment
all the People collectively cannot be enquired of as to what
they will have done, yet one Negative ought not to Interrupt the
whole.</P>
<P>I'll suppose a general Dissolution of Government in any Country,
such as was seen in this Nation at the last Revolution.</P>
<P>The People assembled in a Universal Mob to take the Right of Go∣vernment
upon themselves, are not to be supposed to give their
personal Suffrages to every Article, but they may agree to a Con∣vention
of such Persons as they think fit to Intrust, to Constitute <HI>de
Novo,</HI> and may Delegate their Power, or part of it to such a Con∣vention;
and in such Case a general Concurrence is to be suppos'd,
unless there be a publick Dissent.</P>
<P>Now suppose the general Collective Body of the People should
not unanimously agree, 'tis own'd the Power could not be univer∣sally
Delegated, and there a Division would follow; but in such
Case, those who Dissented from such an Agreement, must declare
their Dissent, and agree to any other Form of Government for them∣selves,
and so divide from the other Body, and if they do not divide,
they in effect do not Dissent.</P>
<P>But then this Division must be before any Members are Delegated
by them to Convene.</P>
<P>For Example:</P>
<P>Suppose the Freeholders in <HI>Cornwall</HI> in such a Case should say,
We do not approve of your deputing Men to meet and consult of a
new Government and Constitution, we are resolved to be govern'd
by <HI>such a Man</HI> of our own Country.</P>
<P>This Resolution being against no Law, and that County having
sent no Members to represent them, and to join with the rest of the
Body, they cannot be legally disturb'd, or punish'd, or forc'd to
Unite with the rest of the Nation.</P>
<P>Such a Division might be look'd upon as a Misfortune to the
General Body, and unkind in the County or part dividing from the
rest, but in the nature of the thing it could not be Unjust.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="26"/>
For as much as any Body of Men are at Liberty, upon the Disso∣lution
of former Contracts, to be Governed by such Laws and Per∣sons,
and in such manner as they shall think fit.</P>
<P>Yet is there no fear of such a Division in a Country so depending
on its several Parts as this is, because the rest would render them so
uneasie, that Interest would compel them to comply.</P>
<P>I do not place this Right upon the Inhabitants, but upon the
<HI>Freeholders;</HI> the <HI>Freeholders</HI> are the proper Owners of the Country:
It is their own, and the other Inhabitants are but Sojourners, like
Lodgers in a House, and ought to be subject to such Laws as the
Freeholders impose upon them, or else they must remove; because
the Freeholders having a Right to the Land, the other have no right
to live there but upon sufferance.</P>
<P>In former Days the Freehold gave a Right of Government to
the Freeholder, and Vassalage and Villinage was deriv'd from this
Right, that every Man who will live in my Land shall be my Ser∣vant;
if he wont, let him go about his Business, and live some∣where
else: And 'tis the same still in right reasoning.</P>
<P>And I make no question but that Property of Land is the best
Title to Government in the World; and if the King was universal
Landlord, he ought to be Universal Governour of Right, and the
People so living on his Lands ought to obey him, or go off of his
Premises.</P>
<P>And if any single Man in <HI>England</HI> should at any time come to be
Landlord of the whole Freehold of <HI>England,</HI> he could indeed have
no Right to Dispossess the King, till the present Legal Settlement of
the Crown fail'd, because it was settled by those that had then a
Right to settle it.</P>
<P>But he would immediately be the full Representative of all the
Counties in <HI>England,</HI> and might Elect himself Knight of the Shire
for every County, and the Sheriff of every County must Return
him accordingly.</P>
<P>He would have all the Baronies and Titles of Honour which are
entail'd upon Estates devolv'd upon him, and upon any Expiration
of the Settlement would be King by natural Right.</P>
<P>And he would be King upon larger Terms than ever any Man
was legally King of <HI>England;</HI> for he would be King by inherent
Right of Property.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="27"/>
When therefore I am speaking of the Right of the People, I
would be understood of the Freeholders, for all the other Inhabitants,
live upon Sufferance, and either are the Freeholders Servants, or having
Money to pay Rent live upon Conditions, and have no Title to
their living in <HI>England,</HI> other than as Servants, but what they must
pay for.</P>
<P>Upon this foot it is that to this Day our Law suffers not a Fo∣reigner
to Purchase any of the Freeholds of <HI>England:</HI> For if a Fo∣reigner
might Purchase, your Neighbours (having Money to spare)
might come and buy you out of your own Country, and take Posses∣sion
by a legal and indisputable Right.</P>
<P>This Original Right was the first Foundation of the several Te∣nures
of Land in <HI>England;</HI> some held of the King, some of the
Lord, some by Knight Service, Soccage, and the like, and some
were called Freeholds. The Lords of Mannors had their Homages
and their Services from their Tenants, as an Acknowledgment that
the Right of the Land gave a certain Right of Government to the
Possessor over all the Tenants and Inhabitants.</P>
<P>And as a thing which will put this Argument out of all question.
The Right to Lands, Mannors, and Lordships was not Originally
a Right granted by Patents from Kings or Acts of Parliament, but
a natural Right of Possession handed down by Custom and ancient
Usage, as the Inheritance from the still more ancient Possessors,
and Prescription, as the Lawyers call it, or Usage time out of mind,
is to this Day allow'd to be a sufficient Title in several Cases, where
Conveyances, Deeds, Charters, and Writings of Estates are silent,
especially as to Buttings and Boundings of Land, Highways, Foot∣paths,
Water Courses, Bridges, and the like.</P>
<P>This Right, as all Right Originally, is Founded upon Reason:
For it would be highly Unreasonable, that those People who have no
share of the House should live in it whether he that built it will or
no. No Person has any Right to live in <HI>England,</HI> but they to whom
<HI>England</HI> belongs; the Freeholders of <HI>England</HI> have it in possession;
<HI>England</HI> is their own, and no Body has any thing to do here but
themselves.</P>
<P>If they permit other People to live here, well and good, but no
Man but a Freeholder lives here upon any Terms but <HI>permisses Supe∣riorum,</HI>
and he pays Rent for his Licence to live here.</P>
<P>Thus the Liberties and Privileges of Towns and Corporations are
founded upon Acts of Parliament to confirm Charters or Grants from
the Crown, by which the Freeholders give their Consent that such
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
and such Bodies of Men living in such Towns, shall enjoy certain
Privileges in Consideration of their being so considerably serviceable
to the Nation, by paying Taxes, maintaining the poor, by Manu∣factures,
Trade, and the like, notwithstanding they are not possess'd
of any part of the Freehold.</P>
<P>And 'tis observable, the King cannot give this Privilege, so as to
enable any of these Corporations to send Representatives to Parlia∣ment.
None but the Freeholders of <HI>England</HI> (and such Towns in
Conjunction) to whom the Freeholders have already granted such
Privilege, can give a Qualification of such a Nature, as is a receiving
them into an equal state of Privilege with a Freeholder.</P>
<P>Every Man's Land is his own Property; and 'tis a Trespass in
the Law for another Man to come upon his Ground without his
Consent. If the Freeholders should all agree, That such a Man shall
not come upon their Land; That they will not Lett him a House for
his Money; That whose Land soever he sets his Foot on, the Owner
shall Indict him for a Trespass, as by Law he may, the Man must
fly the Nation of Course.</P>
<P>Thus the Freeholders having a Right to the Possession of <HI>England,</HI>
the Reason must be good that they must have the same Right to the
Government of themselves, that they have to the Government of the
rest of the Inhabitants; and <HI>that there can be no Legal Poter in</HI>
England, <HI>but what has its Original in the Possessors; for Property is the
Foundation of Power.</HI></P>
<P>I am not undertaking to find fault with our Constitutions, tho'
I do not grant neither, that it is capable of no Amendment; but I
would endeavour to make way, by retreating to Originals, for every
Member to perform its proper Function, in order to put the general
Body into its regular Motion.</P>
<P>For as in the natural Body, if any Member, either by Contraction
of the Organ, Dislocation, or other Accident, fails in the perfor∣mance
of its proper Duty, the Locomotive Faculty is either inter∣rupted,
and the Body distorted, or at least the regularity of Natural
Motion is invaded: So in the Body Politick, if one Branch of the ge∣neral
Union err, and that Error is not Corrected, the whole Con∣stitution
suffers a shock, and there is an Insraction of the general
Order.</P>
<P>The Excellency of our Constitution consists of the <HI>Symitry of
Parts; and the Ballance of Power;</HI> and if this Ballance be broken,
one Part grows too great for the other, and the whole is put into
Confusion.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="29"/>
To give some Instances of this, 'twill be needful to enter a little
into History, and we need not go far to inform our selves, that
there has been a Time when the weakness of our Constitution has
appeared.</P>
<P>Our Constitution, when all the fine things in the World have been
said of it, is not impregnable, when Power has been thrown wholly
into one Scale, the other has always been trampled under Foot, and
overthrown by it.</P>
<P>The Regal Power under King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, over-Ballanc'd the
Lords and Commons, to the invading the Right of Levying Taxes
vested wholly in the Parliament, and to the discontinuing Parlia∣ments
for fourteen Years, and the many Convulsions the Constitution
felt in that time, is too melancholy a Subject to reflect upon.</P>
<P>The House of Commons in the next Settlement over-Ballanc'd
the Lords, and Power being added to one side, toss'd the Upper
House quite out of the Scale, absolutely Annihilated the very being
of the Peers <HI>as a House,</HI> and voted them out of the Constitution.</P>
<P>By the Restoration the Constitution return'd to its Original, and
the Ballance was pois'd again: What attempts have since been made
to overthrow it, are needless to be insisted upon, but the nature of
the thing leads me to make one Remark, That if the King can do no
Wrong, nor is not punishable or blamable by our Constitution, but
the Ministery, as a late Author has very clearly set down. Then
we have acted strangely in the late Revolution; That the Mini∣stery
of the late Reign, <HI>for whose Misbehaviour we thought we had a
just Right to call in Foreign Aid, and to suppress whose exorbitant Power
we took up Arms against our Prince,</HI> should not only not be punish'd
as they deserv'd, but be still capable of acting in the Ministery again,
and of representing in Parliament that very People they had Betray'd.</P>
<P>Not that I am of some Peoples Opinion neither, who think the
late King had hard measure in being Depos'd, when he was
really not accountable. For I presume I may affirm, That the De∣posing
King <HI>James</HI> was founded upon his Deserting the Nation, not
his Male-administration; for had he continued in <HI>England</HI> you might
possibly have subdu'd him, and took him Prisoner, but there had been
no room for Transposing the Crown while he had been alive.</P>
<P>And 'tis allow'd by all, that those Persons who advised him to
quit the Kingdom by flying out of it, either wilfully betray'd him,
or very ignorantly gave him the only Council which could com∣pleat
his Ruine.</P>
<P>How then it comes to pass that those evil Ministers have arriv'd
to Impunity for what was past, and again to be trusted both in the
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
Court and in the Parliament with the Peoples Liberties, <HI>is a Mystery
past our reaches.</HI></P>
<P>If I had no Name my self, I would set down theirs; or if I had a
Press in the Clouds to Print their Practices, the World should not be
Ignorant; but since 'tis not so, I shall only say as our Saviour said of
some Body else, <HI>By their Works ye shall know them.</HI></P>
<P>These are the Men who Cry loudest against the present Ministery,
and on all Occations make use of the pretence of <HI>Liberty</HI> to animate
the Nation against not only the present, but against every Mini∣stery
by which the publick Affairs shall be manag'd, and against
the King himself. The same Men who in former Days Cried up a
Popish Army in a profound Peace, the very same now Cried down
a Protestant Army in time of Danger. The very same Men who
could digest the absolute Power of ruining our Liberty and Religion,
being vested in a Popish King, were the first and forwardest that
durst not trust a Protestant King with Forces enough to defend us till
Peace was better Establish'd, but have by that means, according to
their Hearts desire, laid us and all <HI>Europe</HI> under a necessity of Arming
again to maintain that Peace, which 'twas then in our power to
have maintain'd.</P>
<P>For I am free to say 'twas not the Treaty of Partition which so
much run the <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon giving themselves up to the <HI>French,</HI> as
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was the despicable Figure the <HI>English</HI> Forces were reduced to,
which made the <HI>French</HI> King bold to take possession of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mo∣narchy,
which had some, I do not say all our Forces been continued
but a year or two longer, he would not have ventur'd to have done.</P>
<P>And yet all these Forces might have been subjected so absolutely to
Parliamentary Power, as if they had been their own; for the King
never denied them any Security they desired, and so they might
have been Disbanded as easily now as then.</P>
<P>Nor do I think that in this Discourse I can be supposed to favour
that Party, <HI>if there be such a Party, which indeed I question,</HI> who
would Govern this Nation by the help of a Standing Army; but I
must be allowed to lay down this for a Maxim, That any Force as
shall be agreed to by Consent of Parliament is Legal, and some Force
may at some particular times be necessary, of which the Parliament
are the only Judges.</P>
<P>Still I allow that of this Power so derived from Property, the <HI>House
of Commons</HI> are the Abridgment; they are <HI>the Freeholders of</HI> England
<HI>in M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nature;</HI> to them all needful Powers and Privileges are commit∣ted,
to make them capable of acting for the People they Represent;
<HI>and, Extremities excepted, they are our last Resort:</HI> But if they employ
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
those Privileges and Powers against the People, the reason of these
Powers is destroy'd, the End is inverted, and the Power cease of course.</P>
<P>From hence 'tis reasonable to give them Instructions; and though
they are not conditionally Chosen as to their Instructions. Yet they
ought in Honour to think themselves under equal Obligation to
stand by those Instructions.</P>
<P>Instructions to Members are like the Power given to an Arbitrator,
in which though he is lest fully and freely to act, yet 'tis in Confidence
of his Honour that he will think himself bound by the Directions he
receives from the Person for whom he acts.</P>
<P>If an Arbitrator Inverts the Design of his Principal, he destroys
the end of his Election, and is sure never to be entrusted again.</P>
<P>The <HI>House of Commons</HI> are our Sanctuary against, the Opprssion of
Princes, the Nations Treasures, and the Defenders of their Liber∣ties;
but all these Titles signifie, that at the same time they are the
Nations Servants.</P>
<P>The <HI>House of Commons</HI> also are Mortal, as a House; a King may
Dissolve them, they may die and be extinct; but the Power of the
People has a kind of Eternity with respect to Politick Duration: Par∣liaments
may cease, but the People remain; for them they were
originally made, by them they are continued and renewed, from
them they receive their Power, and to them in reason they ought to
be accountable.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Dissolution of the last Parliament has been subsequent to
the Writing these Sheets, and two Observations fall our so
naturally on this occasion, that I cannot but conclude this Subject
with them.</P>
<P>That both His Majesty and the whole Nation have very happily
given their Approbation to the Positions here laid down.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted but that the Language of the Addresses of the
People presented to his Majesty, upon the Indignity offer'd him
by the <HI>French</HI> King has in general a Dislike included in them of
the Management of their late Representatives; and tho' it is a new
thing, yet it is plain that their Proceedings in general have been
D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sobliging to the Nation.</P>
<P>There was no need to express in words at length, <HI>before also
His Majesty's Intentions were known,</HI> that they desire him to Dis∣solve
the present Parliament. Good Manners required, that
they should not so plainly lead His Majesty in what he was
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
to be the Author of; besides, the Parliament was in Being, and
the illegal Arbitiary Usage of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen fresh in the
Memory of the People. But what is the meaning of the following
Express <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Addresses? <HI>If Your Majesty please to entrust us with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Parliament; When Your Majesty shall be graciously
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Parliament; In Conjunction with a Parliament;</HI> and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> would the Addressors, have us, or have the King to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Expressions, but that the People finding them∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Proceedings of their Representatives, and the
Nation in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of being abused and betray'd to the Invasions of the
<HI>French,</HI> by the Illegal and Arbitrary Designs of a Party in the
House, have recourse to his Majesty, to depose <HI>for them</HI> a Power
which they saw going to be misapplied to the Ruine of those from
whom and for whom it was appointed.</P>
<P>Nor was this any thing but what was seen and known before; all
these Addresses are the Legitimate Off-spring of the <HI>Kentish</HI> Peti∣tion;
and had not the Freeholders been aw'd by the ill usage of the
<HI>Kentish</HI> Gentlemen, the whole Nation had then as unanimously Pe∣tion'd
the House, as they have now Address'd His Majesty.</P>
<P>This is evident from the Tenour, and yet undiscovered Original
of the <HI>Legion Paper;</HI> the Contents of which had so much plain Truth
of Fact, and Truth of Law, that the House stood Convicted in the
plain Consternation the Contents of it threw them in; <HI>and which
I could give a better History of, if it were needful,</HI> by which they
gave a full assent to the Right of the People.</P>
<P>But beyond all this is His Majesty's Proclamation, wherein, ac∣cording
to Truth, Reason, and the Nature of the Thing, His Ma∣jesty
has graciously given a Sanction to the natural Right of his
People, proclaiming from the <HI>English</HI> Throne, of which he is the
most Rightful Possessor by the Voice of the People, that ever sat
on it.</P>
<P>That when the People of <HI>England</HI> do universally express their
Resolution to do what should or ought to be desired of good <HI>English-Men</HI>
and Protestants,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See his Ma∣jesty's Procla∣mation for Dis∣solving the Parliament.</NOTE> <HI>It is reasonable to give them an Opportunity to
chose such Persons to represent them in Parliament, as they may judge most
likely to bring to effect their just and pious Purposes.</HI></P>
<P>The Words need no Comment, they contain in them a glorious
Recognition from the Restorer of <HI>English</HI> Liberty, and unexampled
Testimony to the reasonableness of those just Rights which, <HI>though
former Kings, blinded by Ambition, have endeavour'd to suppress,</HI>
His present Majesty, according to his first Declaration and continued
Practice, has accounted it his Chief Honour to preserve, and which
we doubt not he will hand down unbroken to our Posterity.</P>
