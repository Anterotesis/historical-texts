<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR OF THE COMEDY, AND SPOKEN BY MR. HARLEY.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>OUR bard and I were just about to fight,</L>
<L>When he consented you should set us right.</L>
<L>He says "he's nervous—nought can cool his fever,</L>
<L>"The town won't bear such trivial scenes for ever.</L>
<L>"The times are chang'd—sententious draughts they quaff,</L>
<L>"And all is nonsense now that makes them laugh.</L>
<L>"Morals from Seneca have gain'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he day,</L>
<L>"And poor Joe Miller's jests have died away.</L>
<L>"What then becomes of him, since Joe's no more?</L>
<L>"He never dealt in sentimental lore.</L>
<L>"In modern novels tortur'd virtue's fame,</L>
<L>"Or "from the same" wrote letters "to the same."</L>
<L>"Would that he had!—fine words gain approbation;</L>
<L>"But if you laugh not—where's our Speculation?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My answer was—" Sir Criticize may swear,</L>
<L>"You ought not to be pleas'd, when most you are.</L>
<L>"Say, that's obscure!—he understands not, this—</L>
<L>"But pray—is that the author's fault or his?</L>
<L>"May call that pantomime in which a scene,</L>
<L>"Too much embellish'd by a chair or skreen—</L>
<L>"For ah! how oft when hackney'd logic tires,</L>
<L>"Would Ranger's ladder rouse your latent fires?</L>
<L>"And one broad laugh rais'd by satyric Foote,</L>
<L>"Has done more good than novelist e'er wrote.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The comic muse was born to lash mankind,</L>
<L>Not by false sentiment debauch the mind.</L>
<L>What villain trembles at grave Plato's name?</L>
<L>But Horace' satyr laughs him into shame!</L>
<L>Lecture the proud—will preaching make them humble?</L>
<L>No—but lampoon them and their pride will tumble!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All this I told our bard, but still he sigh'd,</L>
<L>Still urg'd his former doctrines, mine denied—</L>
<L>At length he said that you should settle all,</L>
<L>And by your sentence, he must stand or fall!</L>

<HEAD><HI>SCENE.</HI>—An Apartment in <HI>PROJECT'S</HI> Country House. A Door in Flat.</HEAD>
<STAGE>CECILIA <HI>discovered trying to unlock the Door.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO, nobody being near, I'll make use of the at∣tendant's key, and for the second time converse with my dear Emmeline. We were yesterday in∣terrupted by Sir Frederick, and I had only time to say a few words to my old friend and school-fellow, but now—how! Sir Frederick again!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> FREDERICK FAINTLY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I beg I may not be thus constantly disturb'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Disturb'd! I would request the same favour, Miss Cecilia, but that nothing on earth ever disturbs me; and indeed nothing ever pleases me—I'm in a perfect state of happy <HI>nonchalance</HI>—I fancy though we're both on the same errand—that door, heh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I told you yesterday, sir, I know nothing about that door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, for shame!—what! do you pre∣tend not to know that it leads to that part of the
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>house where Emmeline is lock'd up? come, come, Miss—you remember I caught you bribing the at∣tendant to lend you the key— <STAGE><HI>(Cecilia walks about in agitation)</HI></STAGE> now why be affronted? nothing ever affronts me—no, if you were a man, and chose to say I had caused all Emmeline's sufferings—that I had behaved like a rascal to her—then send me a challenge—then cane—then kick me—why, I shouldn't be affronted—no, I've too much good breeding and good temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely, sir; but as a visitor at Mr. Project's house here in the country, I pry into no family secrets—if I did, I believe the story of this young lady—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, poor girl! she and all her large fortune had been mine if she hadn't—you under∣stand —love touch'd her brain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that's the cause of her present confinement: to be sure she has lately recovered her senses—indeed is quite restored; but her guar∣dian and physician think her entering too suddenly on the world again might occasion a relapse—there∣fore she is kept quiet and close in that part of the house—Would you believe it, ma'am, she preferr'd another man to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! and who could be so accomplish'd as to out-rival a lover like sir Frederick?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A cousin of hers, one Captain Arable, whose father, being averse to the match, sent him to Gibraltar, where ever since—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter a</HI> Servant.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Serv.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, Lady Project desires to see you imme∣diately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There now—you need not be mortified—
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>there's your equivalent: I'm sure her ladyship pre∣fers you to another man, even to her husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>She does, so shew me to her. Miss, if you should get a peep at Emmeline, tell her as I'm always in love in the country—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In the country! Why not in London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that depends on the part of the town I'm in—I constantly adapt myself, and in every street I'm a different man—for instance now: in the Temple I'm a lawyer; in St. James's street a lounger; in St. George's church I'm a married man; in Doctors' Commons a bachelor; Guildhall gives me an appetite: the Alley makes me waddle; in the Squares I'm not worth a farthing; and in Lombard street I've as many plumbs as a banker— So tell Emmeline I still love her and will still be her husband.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now then for my charming recluse— <STAGE><HI>(Opens a door in flat.)</HI></STAGE> Emmeline, it is your friend Cecilia!</P>
<STAGE><HI>She leads in</HI> Emmeline.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, forgive me, 'tis so long since I have seen a friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Come, as we were interrupted yesterday, pray sit down and proceed with your story: the little I have heard makes me anxious to hear more— <STAGE><HI>(They sit.)</HI></STAGE>—now, my sweet friend, proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will when I am able—First then, did you ever hear the name of Edward Ara—? you see my weakness; I have not power to proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay; unbosom your feelings: pray go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will, I will—the name of Edward Arable —it is enough to say we lov'd and were divided— My father chose Sir Frederick for my husband, and on the morn of our intended marriage, they falsely told me Edward was no more. What was to
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>be done? my lover dead! about to be united to his rival! my health long worn by grief and dis∣appointment! Oh my friend! I had not strength to combat against such complicated misery: a fever feiz'd me; my harrass'd brain was heated to deli∣rium, and merciful forgetfulness gave me that com∣fort, my friends and father had denied me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Emmeline! and during your malady your father died.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He did, bequeathing me his whole for∣tune in case of recovery, and appointing Mr. Project my guardian. Now mark what follows: two months ago the physician, who had the care of me, proclaim'd my health restor'd, and I came to this house in the full hope of taking possession of my for∣tune, and sharing it with the man who best deserves it—but what is the reverse? I am confin'd to those rooms; not suffer'd to be seen or spoken to; my letters intercepted and destroy'd, and when I ask the reason for all this, they say, <Q>Your health's pre∣carious, “it requires peace and quiet, and if you mix too suddenly with the world the joy may ”occasion a relapse</Q>—the joy! What joy, my friend? What pleasure can there be in mixing with that world that hitherto has only robbed me of my senses, and thwarted me in my affections?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, Emmeline; and now I see the mo∣tive for your guardian's conduct—He is an enter-prizing man—has involv'd your fortune in his schemes; and at present not being able to give you a fair account, he keeps you close, till by some lucky speculation he is enabled to repay you—but is there no way to extricate you? no means of escaping?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>None; impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have contrived to unlock one door in your
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>room, you see; why can't I get the key of the other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Because it leads to a pagoda that adjoins the house, and which has not been opened since my confinement. Oh Cecilia! is it not hard to wake as from a long and frightful dream, and find all true? no cheering friend to dissipate your terrors? nay, even he whose very smiles would clear the clouds around me! he to be absent! he not near to soothe me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecil.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He knows not of your recovery—your let∣ters have not reach'd him, else—hush! some∣body's coming! <STAGE><HI>(Looks out.)</HI></STAGE> it is your guardian! I cannot leave you so unsatisfied—let me go with you—we'll plan some letters that may recal his sen∣sibility—his heart was once humane; and had he not ruin'd himself by living beyond his income—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! there's the fountain of all modern evil! when once a man exceeds the limits of his fortune, the barrier of honour as well as prudence is thrown down—money is borrowed never to be re∣pai—friends are dup'd and become enemies—the gaming table is flown to as a last effort—till imper∣ceptibly, step by step, the mind, originally virtuous, becomes desperate, harden'd, and unprincipled! and for these errors I am doom'd to suffer! but he's here—Oh my father! why was I left to be the sa∣crifice of another's dissipation and extravagance?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[EMMELINE <HI>and</HI> CECILIA <HI>exeunt at door in flat.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> PROJECT <HI>followed by a</HI> Servant.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, go directly to Portsmouth; take my own carriage and horses, and, when the packet arrives from the East Indies, ask for Mr.
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>Tanjore, and give him this letter—stop, let me read it once more.—</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“<HI>My dear Cousin,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My house in town is magnificently fitted up to receive you—to my house in the country I have added two wings, built in the eastern style to make it more worthy your acceptance; my carriage, horses, and servants are waiting to conduct you to London; and I have got a ”bride for you, young, beautiful, and rich."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>There, that will please the young Nabob: to be sure it was unlucky my shutting my doors against him before he went to India, but these attentions, and bringing his sister Cecilia to my house, will remove former prejudices, and make it a most successful speculation—there, dispatch.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Giving letter to the</HI> Servant.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Serv.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will, sir.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then by marrying him to my ward Em∣meline, I shall prevent any overhawling of accounts, and if I keep her close till he arrives—here comes my wife in a rage at my refusing her money this morning—the miserly spendthrifts! to be saving farthings in the comforts and necessaries of life, and wasting hundreds in luxuries and superfluities.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Lady</HI> KATHARINE PROJECT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, Mr. Project, how dare you refuse me money when I condescend to send for it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Because 'tis time to grow prudent, madam. Wait the event of my speculations before you let folly and extravagance again undo us.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Extravagance!—Sir, 'tis your specula∣tions that have undone us—haven't they all fail'd?—didn't the first wise bubble burst into air?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The first, madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: didn't you give two thousand pounds for a picture gallery? think the pictures all originals? call it the Asiatic Asiphusicon, and say you should make a fortune by its exhibition?—very well, sir, and didn't the famous picture that you advertis'd, as "the celebrated champion of England, by Rembrant," turn out to be nothing more than an old sign of St. George and the Dragon, blown down from an alehouse in Leadenhall Market? wasn't the boasted beech tree, by Claude Lorraine, daub'd out a week before by a glasier's boy, in Cheap-side?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no Madam. Besides if it was, didn't the speculation on bark make me ample amends? didn't I, by the monopoly of that medi∣cine, dispose of it at my own price?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: for the doctors and apothecaries, finding they could get no profit by it, swore bark was unwholesome physic, and nobody took it.—Then didn't you run up so many new houses at Paddington that many of them were built without stair cases; and by the time one part was finish'd, didn't another fall all to pieces?—wasn't—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! have you done, ma'am?—I say it is your false oeconomy that has hurt my fortune: saving trifles and squandering thousands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Squandering!—What, sir, do you pretend I don't consult cheapness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but how, madam? you will lame my best horses by sending them to a cheap black∣smith, and then give a hundred pounds for a ham∣mercloth—you will quarrel with your maid for
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>burning two candles instead of one; and the same night lose a thousand pounds at faro—and, answer me fairly, that you might use otto of roses instead of lavender, haven't you sent me to bed supperless for a whole month?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well: and what then, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you stint the servants in meat and drink, only to dress them with bags and nosegays—and once when you gave one hundred and fifty pounds for a curricle, didn't you want me to drive two miles over impassable roads, only to avoid paying a turnpike?—another time when you and your favourite Sir Frederick—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There he always strikes me dumb—Oh! if I could recriminate! <STAGE><HI>(aside.)</HI></STAGE> Well, sir: what of Sir Frederick? I'm sure there's no impropriety in our intimacy: we are never tête a tête—At the theatre, the opera, all public places, my grand∣mother is always present; and if ever Sir Frede∣rick kist the tip of my finger, the old lady saw it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's impossible: for the old lady's as blind as Cupid.—However, it isn't our interest to quarrel; and if my schemes on the Alderman and the Nabob turn out as I expect, you shall have what money you desire—come, shake hands,—and now walk with me towards Aldgate farm, and I'll explain to you all my plans.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aldgate farm! there again! pray, sir, to whom do you owe the power you have over the Alderman? By whose means is that lump of agri∣culture become an annuity to you?—have not my charms lur'd him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure: he too has a blindness; and by his own affectation of intrigue, and your flattering his vanity—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He is become so attach'd to the wife,
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>that the husband may speculate him out of all his property. Well, sir, since you confess the obligation, I'll walk with you, and see how this curious gentle∣man farmer goes on. Saturday is the day, I think, the rustick comes from London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is: and as usual he only comes to paint his outhouses and neglect his land.—The farm is mine, and he thinks I shall give him a long lease; but when I find he has finish'd his improvements, I'll let it over his head.—Oh, Eliza! this is the age for speculation—People love delusion—ay, so much that the more you dupe them, the better they like you, and while a rich citizen shall propose a fair scheme which nobody adopts, a dashing west-end of the town gentleman shall start a visionary one, and, hey! presto!—every body meets him in full cry—This is my plan, and so the Nabob and the gentle∣man farmer shall find it.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Vickery.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Here are alterations!—The vulgar clod who kept this farm before my master, said he built every thing for use; he minded the value not the look of a thing:—now I think the Alderman has shewn him the difference.—Here he comes, and I must be off to his dear Lady Project with this basket full of choice garden-stuff, and haunches of Nova Scotia mutton. I wish the Alderman may succeed better as a lover than as a farmer; though

<P>There, there are improvements!—Welcome to Aldgate farm, my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thank'ye, Alderman, thank'ye.—Any news in London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ald. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That for London,—that for trade! <STAGE><HI>(snapping his fingers.)</HI></STAGE> here's the spot to make a fortune in. Look my dear friend: isn't every thing so tasty? so neat? so clean? you see at once this is none of your rough dirty farms: it belongs to a gentleman; not to a farmer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True: all the outhouses so new, so neat! ay, common farmers never think of these things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ald. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: plodding blockheads! they think of nothing but ploughing, sowing, and reaping: they look to the inside of their barns; I to the out! that pretty team now; <STAGE><HI>(pointing to one.)</HI></STAGE> it carries all the ashes and other manure to a neighbouring far∣mer's, for you must know I'm too cleanly to have any dust or dirt thrown on my land: a little chalk makes it look light and pretty.—Then the piggery! what do you think of the piggery? there! why there it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on me! in high varnish! Why, its very elegant. But pray, Alderman, haven't you found that the pigs spoil the paint?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ald. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and that the paint spoils the pigs; so I've got an excellent remedy—I keep none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's one way to be sure.—But with regard to the more essential parts of farming,—how goes on your cabbage plantation? your specu∣lation on butter? what have been your profits?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ald. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Profit! ask my bailiff about that. The
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>fact is, Project, I have had a curst unlucky year: the seasons have been against me: a hot winter—a frosty summer—flies, blights, and grubs, in all the corn—sheep, calves, and horses, all with the staggers —foxes eating up my chickens—cocknies shooting my geese—and as for the speculation you mention, why, the cows eat me forty load of hay, and I only made thirty pounds of butter;—"Debtor for hay one hundred forty five pounds, twelve shillings and eight pence. Per contra, creditor for butter, one pound, seventeen shillings, and ten pence halfpenny farthing!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I see it don't answer so well as I expected; but about the plantation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ald. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the cabbages.—Ay: there I've been fortunate.—I tell you what—that plantation and my Nova Scotia sheep will make up for all my losses.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>JACK ARABLE. <HI>(without.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Father—Where are you father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Here's your son. I'm told since he left Oxford and went to study under a special pleader, that he's much improv'd.—Why his education must have cost you a great sum of money, Alderman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ald. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Thousands, thousands! But he'll repay me.—Hark'ye; he is now a Batchelor of Arts—by and by King's Counsel—hereafter member for the county—then great Orator—the Seals—the Cabinet! Oh! there's no doubt but Jack will make his own fortune and mine too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?—why don't you allow him an income?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ald. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not a shilling.—I have given him a most glorious education and that's fortune enough now-a-days. —Now he starts fair, and he's like my field of
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>cabbages; so well cultivated that there's no doubt of a fine crop.</P>

<P>You did! did you?—where's the bailiff? —oh! this is an old manoeuvre—the farmers are in a combination against me, and whenever their cattle want food, they send them to breakfast, dine, and sup on my crops—they're not my sheep, so I'll go and pound them—in the mean time, Jack, do you give my friend, Mr. Project, a specimen of your talents.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Study, heh?—come—that's fair, very fair. Why, my study was to shoot without missing: leap five barr'd gates full speed—get drunk—make love to my laundress—break lamps with my mathematical instruments, and knock down the proctors with the classics—famous, heh?—oh! I finish'd my educa∣tion in a most capital style.</P>

<P>Special Pleading!—I'm above that—mum: —don't tell father, and I'll let you into a

<P>What do you know, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Jack Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That Westminster Hall won't do for Jack Arable—the market's over-stock'd—there's such a croud of black cattle, and so few buyers, that one half must be return'd on the owner's hand, at prime cost.—O!—besides, if one did get a brief, the King's-Bench is like other courts, so crouded, that there's no getting a place in it—and there's the case—I must come back to father—and what then?—he won't give me the Spanish.</P>

<P>The Spanish!—now what the devil's that?</P>

<P>Why, ready money, not credit or paper. When I ask him for a few guineas he reminds me of my education—refers me to Westminster Hall—says I shall be call'd next term and make thousands. Thousands! plague on't!—after being three years a barrister, attending the courts, and going the cir∣cuits; I dare say, I shan't fetch the price of my gown and wig!—so you see, Mr. Project, here am I with a finish'd education in the high road to a jail.</P>
</SP>

<P>No, but I love her fortune; and if I could marry her to-morrow, I'd touch the Spanish, and be off to London directly—to Epsom Races—the grand Cricket Match—zounds!—in making me a Special Pleader, they'd spoil one of the most dashing dogs in Europe.</P>

<P>I tell you, it's all settled—I've seen young Arable: he propos'd marriage, and I gave him as warm a reception as you could wish. But, Lady Katharine Project, sir; she tires me with her insinua∣tions— she says, I come here to seduce her husband's affections, when you know, Mr. Project, he's the last man on earth I should fix on for a gallant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Project's very much oblig'd to you: but the truth is this, Cecilia—she knows I see her partiality for sir Frederick: this makes her all obe∣dience—but if she could once recriminate; only prove I have my gallantries (and I have had them beyond a doubt) why then snap goes the rod I hold over her, and all the money I spent in patching up her reputation—</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Cecilia.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Money, in patching up reputation!— how do you mean, coz?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mean! that when certain people lose their character, they spend half their fortune in at∣tempting to retrieve it—keep open house, give public entertainments—suppers, balls, concerts, galas—then every body comes; for if Belzebub himself gave a dinner, there are people who would go to it!—every body comes, I say—eat, drink, dance, and retire; and while the host and hostess fancy they are sounding their praises, egad! they're only cutting up their reputation, and laughing at them more and more for their folly.</P>

<P>No: she concluded with recommend∣ing me to go to school again and finish my educa∣tion!—Mr. Project, you'll hardly believe it, but she call'd me Master Jacky: laugh'd at my learn∣ing; ridicul'd my manners; and when I reminded her that I had been made a scholar, and<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a gentle∣man, she said I might as well say one of my father's cows had been made to translate Greek, or dance the minuet de la Cour.</P>

<P>She said, that while you were planting shrubberies, building outhouses, and painting the pig stye, your bailiff was cheating you of the small crops your neglected fields produced; that in a month you would spend more money in fattening a single wether, than would supply the Court of Aldermen with turtle and venison for a year; that your garden is as expensive as your farm, for that every Monday morning, when your coach is cram'd with hampers of garden stuff, there isn't a turnip top within them but costs more than all the pine apples in Covent Garden market—that was fair, wasn't it?—very fair.</P>

<P>That's impossible, your ladyship, be∣cause Jack has carried her off already.—She is by this time as safe at Aldgate farm, as Emmeline is in your house, and I dare say they and the parson

<P>Why as all concealment will now be useless, I may venture to inform you that by some accident Emmeline has escap'd, I find; and I came here in search of her, and not to meet your husband ma'am, upon my honour.</P>

<P>Ay; that I will; my son, Captain Edward, is arriv'd, and if he and Emmeline should meet,—I tell you what,—as Jack has made two fools of us, I'll persuade the East Indian to let Edward marry his sister Cecilia.

<P>Not find her! Emmeline not to be found! tell me, sir Frederick, have you been at young Arable's chambers?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have—and he is out of town, at Epsom: positively, I can hear nothing of Emme∣line—but what then? fretting won't find her; and if it did, I dare say you'd find something else to fret you—I'm her lover, and you see I'm not un∣easy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: you hav'nt the reason I have—she may fall into the hands of some enemy, who may say, I have entangled her fortune; confin'd her after her health was restor'd; and at last convince her uncle, the alderman, that I have wrong'd her—then her friend, captain Arable, is in town, you say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he arriv'd last night from Gibral∣tar—receiving a letter that inform'd him of Em∣meline's recovery; he quitted the regiment at the risk of offending his father—leave me to manage him: let me see— <STAGE><HI>(looking at his watch.)</HI></STAGE> I am now going to meet him.</P>

<P>That's him! that's the young Nabob—I order'd the band to strike up as he pass'd through the hall; and as he's been accustom'd to be sur∣rounded with slaves, I've hir'd those Blacks and other attendants to give him a sort of pompous entrée.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there's the East Indian: I won∣der whether Mr. Tanjore's as easy and familiar as ever: I remember when he had neither cash nor credit, he used to call the greatest men by their Christian names; and though he hadn't a coat to his own back, he was always remarking on the dress of other people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! he was no Nabob then: now I fear he's as haughty and reserv'd as he was before free and familiar: good day, sir Frederick: I shall rely on your making captain Arable my friend. <STAGE><HI>(Sir Frederick exit.)</HI></STAGE> now for it: now for my best scheme! to be sure, my tricking him and turning my back on him before he went to Madrass, was rather unlucky; but his coming to my house, proves he don't think the worse of me—no, no: I have him: and when I've fairly strip'd him; I'll send him to India again, there to make another fortune, for the benefit of me and my Speculations!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: the princess Nundomoree took a fancy to my person and dress—introduc'd me to the Nabob of Begumboree: he to the Rajah of Seringapatoree; and so amongst them you see—but, Billy, what makes you so civil? before I sail'd, you wouldn't pay the fare of a hackney coach for me, and now you give me all your carriages and horses: well, well: I take it very kind of you; and so hark'ye—a few westerly winds will bring round the homeward bound fleet, and then hire all the strongest waggons you can get: bullion! pearls! diamonds!—oh, damme, coz, this house shall never hold them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Project.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I hope this house will hold them though: oh! for a westerly wind!—in return, my dear friend, the wife I design for you has five thousand a year—to be sure it's very little; but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A little's better than nothing, you know; and if I like her person and manners, why, five thousand a year will be very pretty pin money: but what's here, Billy?— <STAGE><HI>(looking at his coat,)</HI></STAGE> is this a dress for a cousin of a Nabob?</P>

<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Every thing, now-a-days—a good coat is tantamount to a good character; and if the World be a Stage, it's as necessary to dress as to act your part well: then consider the effect—why, when I landed from the Packet in my old blue coat, shabby red waistcoat, and decay'd kerseymeres, I cut through the alleys, and was push'd and smok'd by every apprentice and shopkeeper I met: but, the moment I put on these smart cloathes that you sent, I swagger'd through the most public streets—jostled all the men of fashion—cock'd my eye at all the lords, and receiv'd the homage and bows of the very shopkeepers and apprentices that had before sneer'd at me. Oh! in this age of false appear∣ances, there's nothing like a shewy outside; and a taylor is a man of more consequence than you imagine.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>Worse and worse: she has almost starv'd me since you went: you haven't yet seen her though: John, call Lady Project.</P>

<P>Nonsense!—Mr. Project says, you have brought over money enough to buy him new houses: new—</P>

<P>Not enough to buy him a new coat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cecilia.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>I liv'd in a jail, my dear sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Come, come; havn't I heard that your furniture was emboss'd with gold? that your din∣ners were more expensive than the governor's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My furniture was the bare walls, and my dinner bread and water; the fact is, a man may starve in India, as well as in England; and, instead of finding gold like dirt, or diamonds like pebbles, I found a sort of gentleman that must be attended to in all countries: I mean a bailiff! 'tis true, they didn't visit me on my arrival; but, in the course of a twelvemonth, they whip'd me into one of their hospitable mansions, and there I should have been at this moment, had not the captain of the Packet assisted me in my escape, and landed me generously in old England! I say generously, for curse me, if I am Nabob enough to pay for my passage.</P>

<P>Amazing! if Mr. Project knew this, he wouldn't be so friendly—</P>

<SP>

<P>He friendly! no: when he and the club had schem'd me out of all the money I had left; they shut their doors against me, while Sir Charles Stanley—I shall never forget his liberality! be∣friended me, and sent me to India: I guess how the mistake has happened—there is a man of my name, at Madras: an old lover of yours.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as to the fashions, coz, they fly so fast one can't be quick enough to catch them—nothing lasts above a day. Before I went to India the whole town was running after the Goddess of Health; she died, I'm told, and the learned Pig came to life; he went the grand tour, and the balloon came into power; that bubble burst, and boxing bore down all before it: then came the varieties of dress, such as short skirts, short hair, short sticks, and short great coats! in short, if the world didn't turn round of its own accord, people of fashion would make it, for the moon, whose votaries they are, isn't half so fickle or so changeable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; then don't you observe the alterations in buildings? my husband and other speculatists, have built so many new streets, and London is so absolutely gone into the country, that a citizen coming to a rout at Marybone, must be at the expence of changing horses, and paying turn∣pikes!—but, I understand, you want some little refreshment.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Little refreshment! now mind Cecily.—Yes, any thing will do, some turtle and venison, a great deal of game, a quantity of pine apples, and plenty of burgundy and champagne. Then about my bed; at the Rajah of Seringapatoree's I always slept under a canopy empanelled with looking-glass, and covered with gold and silver tissue—didn't I, Ce∣ily? you'll get such a bed Kitty. So now for dinner.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lady Pro.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Turtle, venison, canopies, and gold and silver tissue! Mr. Tanjore, you don't intend to live here in the same style you did in India.</P>

<P>Sir Frederick! my old acquaintance! how

<P>Psha! hang ceremony; Ned, your hand Ned—by the bye, Fred. is your friend a riding master?</P>

<P>Why?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Cock'd hat and boots! curst vulgar—you too! never wear a cravat with a full dress'd coat, its like a tooth-drawer. Well! what's the news, my boys?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know of none, but that you were last night re-elected a member of Bubble's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was I? only observe Ned—my cousin Billy brought me into this club, and when they had fleec'd me of all my cash, they kick'd me out as a pigeon quite bare—now I return from India with my feathers fresh moulted, they re-elect me, in the hopes of having another pluck—Ay, it's the way at all your fashionable gaming-houses. "Mr. President, who is the new member proposed?" "A great fool, but very rich!" pop, in goes a white ball.—"Who is the next, Mr. President?" "A great genius, but very poor!" "Here waiter! drop in a black ball."—Your servant though—I can't stay, I must go take a peep at my wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Fred.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your wife!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, gad! it's a most curious business; my cousin says I'm to be married to a lady with five thousand a year, but he either won't or can't tell me who or where she is! however, I overlooked a let∣ter my sister was just now writing, and I suspect spouse is conceal'd in her lodgings—mum! shan't I delight and astonish her! in India I was such a favourite with the women, that one day six prin∣cesses
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>came to prison to see me—Prison did I say? Oh, ay, that was when I fought against Tippoo, had six horses shot under me, and was at last taken prisoner by—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Capt. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, sir, what is this lady's name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Emmeline is her christian name, as to sir∣names, I never knew but two in my life. Sir Charles Stanmore, and your humble servant Tom Tanjore, two as fine fellows as ever handled rupees and pagodas. Fare-you-well. I shall marry this Emmeline to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Capt. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You marry Emmeline, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I Ned! and what's more, I invite you to our wedding-dinner, and you also, Fred. and all your friends, and your friend's friends!—Lady Project desired me to ask the whole town, and I'll take care the nuptials shall be celebrated in the true eastern style of magnificence; here's my card, and if you wish to be asked again, come well dress'd; nothing like a good coat, and so farewell, Fred. and Ned!</P>

<P>It must be her; let's follow him di∣rectly.</P>

<P>Stay, suppose you should meet the Al∣derman there, and I know he has business with this Mr. Tanjore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Capt. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, and not till then, let's think what's to be done? come, lose not a moment—in his sister's lodgings, and he about to marry her! 'tis dark, mysterious! mark me, Sir Frederick. I'd traverse half the world to thank the man that has befriended Emmeline! but if I find she has been wrong'd, if there should live a villain that has added to her sorrows, I pledge my honour to avenge her cause—my life or his must answer the event.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ald. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Only once: if you remember, sir, it was in Mr. Project's park, when the dear Lady Pro∣ject had fainted away and you caught her in your arms. I'm not censorious, Mr. Tanjore, but if her grandmother hadn't come up at the instant—</P>

<P>You'd have been jealous, heh? Well! but about your son—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ald. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sir; I wish your sister to become the wife of my son, Captain Arable; the reprobate has quitted his regiment to pursue an unhappy young lady, that I'm determined he shall never be united to. Now, sir, by the recommendation of that worthy man, Mr. Project—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Obadiah, where did you get that curious waistcoat?—positively, it's only fit for an alderman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ald. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then it's fit for me Mr. Tanjore; for I am an alderman.—Ay, and a farmer too, and if I could find my son, and Cecilia would consent, we'd whisk down to Aldgate farm to night: tack them together to-morrow, and in the course of a month, you can get them out to India, and there you know they're snug and comfortable for life. To a man of your interest, I suppose eight thousand a year will be—</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing—a mere trifle.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh! there is, is there? now then I'll go and detain him till we meet at the charming Lady Project's. Show me to him, sirrah.

<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Good day, Obadiah. Now this it is to be a Nabob! I'm as much sought after here as in India, and exactly from the same motive—friends want money here, and the bailiffs there. Here she is!

<P>What has my escape avail'd me? this letter renews my sufferings with tenfold force.— Married! to whom?</P>
<STAGE><HI>Reads.</HI></STAGE>
<P><Q>“My brother Tanjore agrees to your guar∣dian's proposals, and determines to marry you: I must regret this, while I know there is one ”who so much better deserves you.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore. (behind.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—He must be a very clever fellow, then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme. (reading.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“I have conceal'd from Tan∣jore your present residence, yet I think if he knew that you had escap'd from your guardian, be∣cause he made a prisoner of you, and embarrass'd ”your fortune</Q>—</P>
<P>What then?—he is weak enough to think him honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore. (behind.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No; he's not such a fool as that either.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme. (reading.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“If he knew that Edward Arable has won your heart—that your uncle the Alderman deserts you—that a marriage under these circumstances will be death to you and ”misery to him;</Q>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore. (behind.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Misery indeed!—this is more like a funeral than a wedding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme. (reading.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“And lastly, if you were to inform him, that your father, Sir Charles Stan∣ley was the man who befriended him in the hour of misfortune, I think he is not so void of gratitude and humanity, but he would assist rather ”than distress you.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore. (coming forward.)</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That he would—well said, sister; you have done your part, now let your brother do his.—Ma'am, my name is Tanjore:
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>your father got me out to India, when I hadn't a house to pop my head in; and though the habitation I pop'd my head into there wasn't altogether so comfortable, that was no fault of Sir Charles's.— He was my benefactor—I am your friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible? Will you not force me to accept your hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Accept my hand! I'll cut it off first. I wouldn't marry you for all the bullion in Bengal! Not but what I could love you Emmeline; and but for Ned—ah, but for Ned! we might have been a very happy, handsome couple!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can this be the man I was taught to expect? Can this be the haughty East Indian, whose riches—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Riches! that's your guardian's story: he insists upon it, I've brought home millions, and as he must know better than I do, it would be rude to contradict him, you know—but enough of myself, —Tell me how I can serve you? My poverty shall not prevent me going instantly to this speculatist and commanding him to do you justice. Zounds! I wish I had him in Calcutta: I'd march an army against him, as black as his own heart—cram him into the hot hole and smother him, if he didn't give you your fortune, and the man that deserves you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I insist you run no hazard on my account. I have form'd a determination which I shall now execute: it is, to go instantly and make one more appeal to my uncle—to Alderman Arable—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What Obadiah! he was here just now and seems so fond of your guardian—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know it; he has the highest opinion of his honour and veracity; but as the Alderman is the nearest relation I have left, he is the most proper
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>person to protect me; and therefore I shall make this last effort to undeceive him. Yonder is your sister, I see: she will conduct me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Allow me to attend you—heigho!— I don't know what's the matter with me. I feel such new emotions, and there's such a warm glow about my heart, that, gad! it fancies itself in India. Can you tell me what it means, ma'am?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Emme.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I cannot, sir; but very likely it results from the satisfaction of having done a gene∣rous action, and the emotion is new, because like too many others, you have perhaps sacrific'd your time and happiness at the shrine of fashion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's it ma'am—you have hit it exactly —Oh! what I have suffer'd by keeping up the appear∣ance of a fine gentleman!—Horses I never rode— carriages I never saw—Houses I never enter'd— frequenting clubs, routs, operas, and in short doing every thing I dislik'd, because I was told, it was what I ought to like:—but now I've done with it— henceforth I'll live to please myself; and while I don't suffer in my own opinion, what need I care for that of other people. Come, sweet Emmeline; you shall be happy still.</P>

<P>Then the truth is, the Alderman has lock'd up Miss Emmeline, and sent me for her Guardian, to whom she is to be deliver'd and confin'd for life—there, now you know the fact, and I take my leave.</P>

<P>Send for her Guardian and confine her for life!—what's to be done?—while my father is attach'd to this hypocrite, there is no way to extri∣cate or save her.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there is one—you seem a fine fighting fellow—Tom Tanjore's another, and as her father once sav'd me from being confin'd, while I can cock a pistol, or brandish a cane, I won't see his daughter expos'd to a similar predicament—come along Ned—we'll trip up Obadiah and carry her off.</P>

<P>What! are you the friend of Emme∣line?</P>

<P>Yes, and your's because you are hers—come let's have at them—what! do you shirk?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Capt. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I dare not go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dare not!—now this is always the way with your fighting gentlemen—but perhaps it's con∣stitutional, and the poor fellow's conscience is a little tender—ay, ay, some of us Nabobs have very weak nerves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Capt. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You misconceive—her Uncle is my father—he has forbid me his presence, and would you have me lift my arm against a parent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No Ned: but as he is no father of mine, and Emmeline is in danger, there can be no harm in my trying trick, stratagem, or force, to protect her; therefore I'll start alone; and may I go to India or to prison—and one will of course follow the other—if I don't snatch her from Obadiah, and restore her to my dear Ned!</P>

<P>The attempt is hopeless; but be it as it may—I request on knowing how I can return your kindness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tanjore.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there are two ways—the first is that you patch up your quarrel with Project, in order that you may celebrate your nuptials at his house, and the next is, that as Emmeline will like you the better for resembling me, you marry her in the fellow coat to that I now wear—it's a pretty

<P>Don't touch him—I'll wake him, or the devil, or his own conscience will wake him—begone sirrah, or— <STAGE><HI>(exit Vickery with bottle and glasses)</HI></STAGE>—pheugh!—what's to be done now?—if I can't get this guardian out of the house without seeing the Alderman, murder will be the conse∣quence, for sooner than give her up, curse me if I don't shoot Billy, choak Obadiah, and poison the doctor!—pheugh!—</P>

<P>The luckiest dog in Europe, Jack. Your father Obadiah sent me to look after you here at Bubble's, and not seeing you I put my hand in my pocket where I found five guineas my sister had lent me, "I'll have a touch," says I, "this Faro Bank dished me formerly, now I'll try to dish them"— down went the five guineas on your namesake the knave of clubs, Jack, the knave in my favour!

<P>Me going to draw a settlement!—No, I'm going to cock the knave; and as to father, he can't blame me, because he once play'd himself, you know. I'll tell you how it was, sir; (<HI>to</HI> TANJORE.) he was sent for, as magistrate, to put down a hazard table—in he came with the constables—push'd down the groom porter—seiz'd the caster—laid hold of the dice-box, when lo! as if there was magic in the wood, he cast his eyes at the guineas on the table, and avarice so compleatly got the better of justice, that he hallowed out, "seven's the main— at all in the ring, my jolly boys."</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Capt. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is but temporary consolation, while the Alderman's absurd vanity attaches him

<P>I did, and when she heard she was to wed Sir Frederick, there was a wild emotion in her countenance portending that her fever would re∣turn —she said, "they'd rob her of all hope, and once more steal her senses; yet they should not, I would not let them, would I?" then with a sigh she left me; Oh, my friend! I am not used to sink beneath misfortune, but this last scene has quite unman'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tan.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>More shame for you, it only animates me, misfortunes always rouse me, and if ever you should be in prison at Madras, the gaolers there will tell you so. I've already exposed the husband; now I'll try to manage the wife; she loves money; here's plenty, so I'll go directly and bribe her.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Capt. Ar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That will be hopeless, nothing but ex∣citing the Alderman's jealousy.</P>

<P>I'll try that too, Obadiah half suspects me at present, so wait for your brother and come toge∣ther to Lady Project's, and by the time you arrive if all isn't to your wishes, may the monsoon deluge me! may Tippoo torture me! may the marattha's —but this is no time for fine speeches—fol∣low me to Lady Project's— <STAGE><HI>(going, returns.)</HI></STAGE> and d'ye hear, Ned, bring your wedding coat along with you, for damme, but you shall be Emmeline's husband this very night!</P>

<P>And is there none to share your treasures?—is there no fair one worthy a heart so warm and so benevolent.</P>

<P>Hereafter perhaps it may find one like Emmeline's.—Till then, I shall pursue a plan, which had Project follow'd, he had now been happy—that is, not to waste a fortune in dissipation, and try to retrieve it, by false and unjust Speculation.</P>

<Q><L>If we must scheme let us try Projects here.</L>

<LG>
<L>THE Drama done, proceed we now to say</L>
<L>Something about, or not about the play;</L>
<L>Fine subject ours—rare times! when Speculation</L>
<L>Engrosses every subject in the nation;</L>
<L>To help the State,—Jews, Gentiles, all are willing,</L>
<L>And for the Omnium, venture their last shilling;</L>
<L>Nay, some subscribe their thousands to the Loan,</L>
<L>Without a single sixpence of their own:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be that their Speculation—I profess,</L>
<L>To speculate on one thing only—Dress;</L>
<L>Shew me your garments, Gents, and Ladies fair;</L>
<L>I'll tell you whence you come, and who you are—</L>
<L>But sportsman like, to hit the game, I'll try,</L>
<L>Charge, prime; present my glass, and cock my eye,</L>
<L>What a fine Harvest this glad Season yields!</L>
<L>Some Ladies' heads appear like stubble fields;</L>
<L>Who now of threaten'd famine, dare complain?</L>
<L>When every female forehead teems with Grain;—</L>
<L>See how the wheat-sheaves nod amid the plumes!</L>
<L>Our Barns are now transferr'd to Drawing-rooms;</L>
<L>And husbands who indulge in active lives,</L>
<L>To fill their Granaries, may thrash their wives;</L>
<L>Nor wives alone prolific, notice draw,</L>
<L>Old Maids, and young ones, all are in the straw.—</L>
<L>That damsel wrapt in shawls, who looks so blue,</L>
<L>Is a return from India—things wont do—</L>
<PB REF="81"/>
<L>The market's up—she couldn't change her name;</L>
<L>No rich Ram-Rowws, or Wang jang Wappers came;</L>
<L>Bad Speculation, Bet, so far to roam;</L>
<L>Black legs go out, and Jail birds now come home—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You stripling there—all trowsers, and cravat,</L>
<L>No body, and no chin—is call'd a Flat;</L>
<L>And he beside him, with a square cut frock,</L>
<L>Button'd before, behind a square cut dock;</L>
<L>Is, I would bet, nor fear to be a loser,</L>
<L>Either a man of fashion, or a bruiser:</L>
<L>A man of fashion! nothing but a quiz—</L>
<L>I'll shew you what a man of breeding is:</L>
<L>With back to fire, slouch'd hat, and knowing slang,</L>
<L>He charms his mistress by this sweet harangue;</L>
<L>"Well, pretty, lovely Lucy! how d'ye do?</L>
<L>"Come, see my puppy!" "No, Harry, to see you."</L>
<L>"You're vastly welcome, you shall see my stud,</L>
<L>"And ride my poney,"—<HI>"Harry, you're too good."</HI></L>
<L>"Zounds! how it freezes! Fly was Sancho's sire—</L>
<L>"Miss, can you see?"—"I'd like to see the fire."</L>
<L>That's your politeness—that's your flaming lover:</L>
<L>The fair may chill—but he'll be warm all over.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We're an odd medley, we must all confess—</L>
<L>Strange in our manners, stranger in our dress:</L>
<L>Whim is the word—droll pantomimic age!</L>
<L>With true tip-tops of taste, Grotesque's the Rage!</L>
<L>Beaux in long sleeves, and small cloaths, close confin'd,</L>
<L>Belles bunch'd before, and bundled up behind;</L>
<L>The flights of fashion bordering on buffoon,</L>
<L>One looks like Punch, the other Pantaloon:</L>
<L>But hold—my raillery makes some look gruff—</L>
<L>So I'll steal off—I think I've said enough.</L>
