<HEAD>AN <HI>ADDRESS,</HI> To the DIGNITARIES OF THE <HI>CHURCH OF ENGLAND;</HI> By the Rev. JAMES MURRY, <HI>OF NEWCASTLE,</HI> AUTHOR OF SERMONS TO ASSES, <HI>And of Two Sermons for the General Fast</HI> 1781.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU always provide the inferior Clergy, your menial church servants, with a form of prayer, to be used on the day of national fasting, but you totally neglect to furnish them with ser∣mons, suitable for such an occasion.—Your remissness in this particular, is perfectly consistant with the tenour of your con∣duct: you concur in the appointment of general fasts; but while you wallow in excess and roit, alas? you leave your Curates (poor souls,)to experience the practical part of fasting. In this you follow the example of your antient friends, the Pharasees, "You bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders, but you will not move them with one of your fingers." How often my lords, have you squandered more money at one entertainment, than two or three curates have for the support of themselves, and their families for a whole year? The reflection would make any person blush, except a modern Bishop—Your consciences are stupified through voluptousness; but the day is nigh at hand, when your titles will not avail, nor your lawn sleeves and mitres protect you, from the righteous judgment that will be passed on every one. When men will not receive a partial sentence, or be judged according to exter∣nal appearance, but where all distinctions of character will be laid aside.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>A FEW EXTRACTS, <HI>Taken from the</HI> Rev MR. MURRRY'S <HI>first sermon, for the general fasts,</HI> in 1781, text, Ecclesiastes, x. 16. <HI>Woe to thee Oh land! when thy King is a child, and thy Princes eat in the morning.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This land in which we live; one would think would have no reason to be afraid of the first part of this heavy woe, in the text,—for the sovereign of the British Empire, has himself a nu∣merous and <HI>beatiful</HI> family of children, which in one sense clears him of the imputation of being a child. With respect to the latter part of this woe, there may be some reason to hesitate,
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>The word in the text, which signifies princes, is not confined in its signification to princes of the blood royal, but may also be app<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to chief men, or the companion-of princes—or it may be used to signify privy councellors, or ministers of state. When persons of this character mind eating in the morning, more than the necessary business of the commonwealth, it is truly a woeful thing to any nation.</P>
<P>It appears sufficiently evident, that Solomon means in this place, by eating and drinking in the morning, those nocturnal re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els, where people at up till three or four in the morning, and go to rest when they should go to business, and are not fit for employment till the middle of the day.</P>
<P>The danger that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a nation, when princes eat in the morning is very gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for when their judgments are blinde I and their imaginations <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they are ready to pursue those ob∣jects of desire, which fancy suggests, instead of those which reason and judgment would dictate to sober persons, and so they either forget national concerns to pursue their own fancy, or manage all public concerns according to imagination and contrary to reason and found judgment. It is not to be supposed that their lordships, who have gone to bed gordged with high seasoned food, and strong drink at four o'clock in the morning, can be well qualified to judge of an express from Berlin, Madrid, or the West-Indias. For though they may be wiser than other men (which is even problematical) yet they are not naturally stronger, and must have rest and sleep as well as others. And it is plain that their wisdom can be of little service to the nation when they are asleep. It is true, they have secretaries that are intended to wait upon business in their absence:—but wicked fame says, that they also eat in the morning and sleep as long as their matters.</P>
<P>There is another woeful thing happens, when princes and privy councellors eat in the morning, and that is, it gives the world reason to infer, that the sovereign, though he may be a man in point of age, is but a child in conduct, when he employs such irregular and slothful servants, to manage the business of the em∣pire; for it seldom happens that the first and latter part of this woe is seperated.</P>
<P>If Great Britain is at this day an exception, it will be a hap∣py circumstance.</P>
<P>When the king is a child, and princes eat in the morning, it is no uncommon thing to see those muddy legislators exagerate modern statues, and enforce them by the severest sanctions, which are diametrically opposite and contrary to ancient laws, and fundamental institutions. Rulers cannot be supposed well qualified to make laws for others, when they are under the imme∣diate influence of intemperance, and their senses and underst∣ings annhilated, and in a real del<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um: princes and ministers of state, can but ill advise for the good of a nation, when they are led tottering from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to their palaces, and tumble into
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>their couches in a state of insensibility; supported by such totter∣ing pillars, it is no wonder the state staggers, and the throne shakes.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen rulers are intoxicated with ideas of power, and have their passions inflamed with dissipation, they are ready to ima∣gine, that the whole community is as foolish as themselves, and for that reason endeavour to persuade the people, that it is faction to oppose their measures, and treason to maintain their own rights. Because people will not minister to the gratification of the lust and appetites of those who want to enslave them, they are called factious and rebellious.</P>
<P>The prophet Isarah will help us to understand what is proper∣ly rebellion: he says, <Q>thy princes are rebellions, and the com∣panions “of thieves, every one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fartherless, neither doth the cause ”of the widow come before them.</Q> From this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is plate, that princes may be rebellious, and that when they are the com∣panions of thieves, they come under that predicament, joining interest and partnership with thieves and dishonest persons. These are such as take what is not their own, and apply it to their own purposes, this is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>urse compliment to princes, but as it is given by an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prophet, it cannot be taken amiss. It is also dishonest to promote, or procure laws that make it le∣gal, to give them more than the people can afford; this comes under the notion of theft, and rebellion, according to the pro∣phet's idea.</P>
<P>The princes of Judea▪ and Isr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>I▪ went partnership with the sovereign in the plunder of the nation, they voted large supplies to the king, because they knew they should receive a share in the revenue and might promote a law for encreasing the civil lift, in hope of serving in his majesty's houshold; but this was theft and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> justice and the laws of the land.</P>
<P>Seeking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gifts, and following after rewards, are joined rebellion, this probably refered to a vote of credit, which the ad∣ministration of Judea, procured to answer the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of secret service, without any design of going any thing with it for the good of the nation, this is joined with theft and rebellion.</P>
<P>And indeed, what can be a greater theft than to procure the credit of a nation, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> money for the service thereof, and apply it to private purposes? Were such a thing done in Britain, the whole nation would have reason to cry out against it.</P>
<P>Thus it is plain, that rebellion is not a crime, peculiar to the people only, but is sometimes to be found in the springs of go∣vernment. Some would make us believe that kings and princes cannot be guilty of rebellion, but the scripture informs us other∣wise.</P>
<P>As we are certain from the best authority, that even princes may rebel. The question is—Ought they to be punished like other rebels, and who can lawfully punish them: whether there is any difference between trying kings and princes for rebel∣lion, and punish them without trying them? I shall leave to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to determine,</P>

<L>IN this our Isle</L>

<L>Now liberty's gone</L>
<L>Oppression will come,</L>

<L>That freedom may smile,</L>
<L>Again in our Isle,</L>
<L>And corruption on longer will stand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fol de rol &amp;c.</NOTE></L>

<L>If we cou'd do this,</L>

<L>If our ends we do get,</L>
