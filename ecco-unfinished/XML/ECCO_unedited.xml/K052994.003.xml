<P>IN the persecution raised against the Sa∣cramentarians (A. D. 1538) John Nicholson, alias Lambert,<NOTE PLACE="inter">An account of John Nichol∣son, otherwise John Lam∣bert.</NOTE> was soon made an example of. This man had been minister to the English company at Ant∣werp, but was dismissed on account of his belief. He afterwards kept a school at London; and hearing Dr. Taylor preach upon the real presence in the eucharist, presented him with his reasons for op∣posing that doctrine. These were shewn to Cran∣mer, who was then of Luther's opinion in that article<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Luther's life, p. 115 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>, and endeavoured to bring Lambert to his way of thinking. Lambert appealed to the King: and his Majesty, in order to display his zeal and theo∣logical knowledge, undertook to confute him in West∣minster-hall, before the Bishops, Nobility, and Judges of the realm. Accordingly, in November, the delin∣quent was brought thither, where the trial was opened
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>by Dr. Day, in a speech, representing that the assem∣bly was not convened to dispute about any point of faith; but that the King, being supreme head of the church, intended openly to confute and condemn that man's heresy (pointing to Lambert) in their presence. His Majesty then commanded the prisoner to declare his sentiments about the sacrament of the altar: and Lambert began his answer by a preface, acknowledge∣ing the King's great goodness, that he would thus hear the causes of his subjects, and commending his great judgment and learning. Upon this Henry interrupted him, telling him, in Latin, that he came not there to hear his own praises; and commanded him to speak to the matter. The King asked him, whether Christ's body was in the sacrament or not? Lambert answered in the words of St. Austin, "It was his body in a certain manner:" But Henry ordering him to answer plainly, he said, "It was not his body." Upon that the King urged him with the words of scripture, "This is my body;" and then commanded the Archbishop to con∣fute Lambert's opinion. Cranmer spoke only to that part of the Sacramentarian's argument which was grounded on the impossibility of a body's being at two places at one and the same time, and endeavoured to support the contrary by mentioning Christ's appearing to St. Paul, alledging, that tho' Christ be always in heaven, yet he was seen by St. Paul in the air. Lam∣bert affirmed, that Christ was then only in heaven, and that St. Paul heard a voice and saw a vision, but not the very body of Christ. The dispute lasted from twelve to five, during which time Lambert was fre∣quently interrupted, and brow-beaten, by his adversa∣ries, who extolled, with the most extravagant enco∣miums, the King's learning, and at last declared vic∣tory on his Majesty's side. Lambert, thus confuted, was asked by Henry, if he was convinced of his error, and whether he would live or die? He answered, that he was not convinced by any arguments he had heard,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>and that he should "commit his soul to God, and submit his body to the King's clemency." His Ma∣jesty then told him, if he did not recant, he must die, for he would not be a patron to heretics: and because he would not do that, Henry ordered Cromwell to read the sentence, which he, as the King's vicegerent, did, declaring Lambert an incorrigible heretic, and con∣demning him to be burnt. This sentence was very soon after executed, with horrid circumstances of bar∣barity, in Smithfield, where Lambert expired, crying out, "None but Christ, None but Christ."</P>
<P>A. D. 1539.] The adulation bestowed on the King, at the conference with Lambert, inspired him with such an high notion of his own ability, as proved equally fatal to both parties; for he now resolved to punish rigorously all who should presume to dissent from him in point of faith, without making any dis∣tinction between papists or reformers. The interest of the latter began to decline insensibly at court since the death of Queen Jane, who had favoured the progress of the reformation. Cranmer, however, still kept his footing in the King's good graces by dint of personal merit; but Cromwell is said to have minded his own interest rather than that of religion; Shaxton, Bishop of Salisbury, was proud and litigious; Latimer, of Worcester, was weak and simple; Barlow, of St. Asaph, shallow and imprudent; and the other preachers of the new religion were generally enthusiasts, who suffered themselves to be hurried away by an intempe∣rate zeal, which paid no regard to the temper and character of their Sovereign, and consequently never failed to incur his indignation. They flattered them∣selves, that they had gained an accession of strength by the promotion of Edmund Bonner to the see of Here∣ford, upon the death of Edward Fox: but they were greatly disappointed; for that Prelate, notwithstand∣ing the obligations he was under to the chiefs of the
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>reformation, became one of their most rancorous ene∣mies.</P>
<P>King Henry now saw himself without any ally on whom he could depend, since the Emperor and the King of France had accommodated matters between themselves; for although he had been, for some years, treating with the Protestant Princes and cities of Germany, en∣gaged in the league of Smalcalde, the negotiations had produced no effect. This was, perhaps, owing to the stiffness of those Princes and states, who, having enter∣ed into what they called a league of religion, in which they entirely agreed among themselves, did not care to unite with such as differed from them therein; and had refused to admit the Protestant Swiss Cantons into their league, only because these last, following the doctrines of Zuinglius, did not agree with them in the point of Christ's presence in the eucharist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 110 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>. Several years had elapsed, since they had sent their confession of faith to England; and the King, tho' desirous of Me∣lancthon's coming over to him, had neither expressed his approbation thereof, nor declared wherein he dis∣approved it, nor given them the reasons of his dissent: and they much disliked several doctrines, which he continued to encourage in England, not allowing any body to vary from his sentiments. He made, how∣ever, the last year, another attempt towards an union: and sent Christopher Mount to the meeting of the Pro∣testants at Brunswic. His instructions were, 1st, To see who engaged in the confederacy; 2dly, Whether their league was for general defence, or limited only to matter of religion; and, 3dly, To require a final answer, whether they would send over Melancthon, with the great legation they had promised. They de∣sired to be excused in the last point, because they had present use for their learned divines; and insisted, that the King should first declare what points he disliked in
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>their confession. As to the other two articles, they said their league was only in the cause of religion, and sent the names of the confederates, being twenty-six cities, and twenty-four Princes; among whom the King of Denmark had been lately admitted. To pre∣pare matters, however, for a further treaty, three agents were sent over to dispute with the English di∣vines about religion: but, after some conferences, they were recalled, leaving behind them a remon∣strance, touching several abuses in England, particu∣larly, <HI>the communion in one kind only, private masses,</HI> and <HI>the celibacy of the clergy.</HI> Against these they alledged several arguments drawn from the scriptures, and pri∣mitive fathers; and, as their Princes would never ad∣mit them, they recommended it to the King to restore religion in all its primitive purity. Henry was too conceited of his own learning, and too fond of his own opinions, to give up any thing he had adopted: he expected, that the German Protestants should con∣form to his model of reformation; and, giving the agents no other answer but what consisted in defending the points excepted against, they returned much dis∣appointed and unsatisfied.</P>
<P>The German Protestants refusing still to assist the Emperor against the Turks, unless he would grant them such a peace in religion, as might comprehend both the present and future confederates, he formed a league with some Roman Catholic Princes of the em∣pire, in opposition to theirs, and for a mutual defence, if molested for the Popish religion. He thought fit, however, to treat with the Protestants for an accom∣modation: but the conference held on that account, this year, at Francfort, came to nothing. Before the issue was known, the King sent Mount to Germany, "to complain of their treating for a pacification with∣out his knowledge, to learn the conditions thereof, and whether they intended to adhere to the doctrine they professed." This induced them to send agents
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>over again to England, to assure him, "that the pa∣cification was not like to take effect, and no conditions had been so much as proposed; that they should com∣ply with nothing contrary to the Augsbourg confession; but, as his Majesty had enjoined the practice of the very things they had excepted against, under the seve∣rest penalties, they could not, unless he was pleased to mitigate them, send over the legation of divines he expected."</P>
<P>They had brought over with them a letter from Melancthon, exhorting him, "to perfect the refor∣mation begun, and not hearken to such as would hin∣der it, by insisting too rigorously on ceremonies, and things indifferent; for which reason he intreated him to mitigate his late proclamation." But Henry, ex∣pecting all should conform to his sentiments and orders, was so far from listening to this advice, that he got the articles in question confirmed by his next parliament, under heavier penalties.</P>
<P>Whatever danger the King apprehended from a∣broad, he ascribed it all to Cardinal Pole (against whom he had conceived a most violent hatred) as the great inciter of foreign Princes to invade his realm, and to his correspondences, as giving encouragement to make the attempt. To guard against it, he laid out considerable sums in erecting castles and forts in dif∣ferent parts of the sea-coast, which he went in person to view, and in putting his navy in a good condition. He had spies in all places, even in the Cardinal's fa∣mily, and, if he did not know all the particulars that passed between him and his correspondents, he yet knew enough to prevent their designs. It was perhaps a sense of this knowledge, the fear of a detection, or a despair of success, that induced Sir Geffery Pole, one of the Cardinal's elder brothers, to make a discovery of some persons concerned in that correspondence. These were, his eldest brother Henry Lord Montacute, Henry Courtenay Marquis of Exeter (cousin-german
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>to the King, as being son to Catherine, daughter of Edward IV.) Sir Edward Nevil, brother to the Lord Abergavenny, and Sir Nicholas Carew, of Bedding∣ton in Surry, Master of the Horse to the King, and Knight of the Garter. The two Lords were tried by their peers, the Lord Chancellor Audely sitting as High Steward; and being found guilty, were behead∣ed. The two knights had the same fate; the latter, who having been before a zealous Papist, had been converted by some book he read during his imprison∣ment, acknowledging, at his execution, the justice of God's judgments on him, for the hatred he had bore the gospel, and exhorting every body to read the scrip∣tures. Two priests and a mariner were put to death for the same offence: but Sir Geffery Pole was par∣doned.</P>
<P>Another measure the King took, against the danger he apprehended, was by increasing his treasure.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Act to con∣firm the disso∣lution of mo∣nasteries.</NOTE> It was disputed, whether the head of a body corporate could alone dis∣solve the corporation, or by a personal of∣fence forfeit its lands; though it appears by the years books, that the Abbot or Prior of a con∣vent were, by the law of England, always deemed the only persons living or capable of acting, in such a religious body; the rest being dead to the world, and having renounced all property. To remove this doubt, a parliament meeting on April 28, passed an act<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stat. 31 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE> to confirm all such resignations, surrenders and forfeitures, not only what had already been made, but such as should be made hereafter; and to vest in the King, and his heirs, all their rights and possessions, without any regard to founders, and their heirs, or any exception, either of the appropriate rectories, usurped upon the parochial clergy, to their scandalous impoverishment, and the great detriment of religion,
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>or of the exemptions from the jurisdiction of the or∣dinary, which those monasteries had obtained by papal bulls, to the great obstruction of ecclesiastical disci∣pline. The motives, that, beside the dread of the King's power, either induced the two houses to pass this act, or were urged for that purpose, seem to have been, their hopes of sharing in the spoils of the mo∣nasteries, the saving themselves from a tax, to defray the great expences the King was at, in providing for the defence of the realm, against the croisade, which the Pope at this time solicited; and the being ex∣cused for ever from all fifteenths, loans, and subsidies; the revenue added to the crown, by the dissolution of religious houses, being sufficient to enable the King to live on his own, and defend his realm, upon any sud∣den invasion or insurrection, to assist his allies on oc∣casion, to reward his well-deserving subjects, and to maintain a body of 40,000 disciplined men, under ex∣perienced commanders. In consequence of this act, promises, threats, pensions, all manner of ways were employed, to procure superiors to surrender their houses: and scarce any were proof against these temp∣tations. Such, as stood out, were made obnoxious on some other account, as for treasonable correspondence, bulls from Rome, or refusal of the oath of supre∣macy; and were put to death: this was the fate of the abbots of Glastonbury, Reading and Colchester<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stat. 28 Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>, and their houses were, on that pretence, declared to be forfeited. Endeavours were used to save some, where the religious had been exemplary in their lives, from the general ruin. Latimer interceded for that of Great Malverne, in his diocese of Worcester; the gentry of Oxfordshire petitioned for the nunnery of Godstowe, where their daughters were ordinarily educated; and to have kept up some of the monasteries of men, under other regulations, for a retreat to decayed gentle∣men,
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>and contemplative persons weary of the world, and of the women for the purposes here mentioned, would have been a great convenience for the whole kingdom. But none were spared<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE>: and thus 645 mo∣nasteries, 90 colleges, 2374 chantries and free chapels, and 110 hospitals, were dissolved; their revenue in land, being valued at 161,100 <ABBR>l</ABBR> a year, and their plate, furniture, stock and personal estates, amounting to an immense sum; as may be judged, from the in∣stance of St. Edmondsbury, whence 5000 marks of gold and silver were taken, besides several jewels of immense value.</P>
<P>The King had, at Cranmer's suggestion,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Six new sees founded.</NOTE> formed a scheme for erecting several new episcopal sees, and for endowing them with the lands of dissolved monasteries: and an act<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stat. 31 Hen. VIII. c. 9. Burnet, vol. i. 262, 269.</NOTE> passed for enabling him to execute this design. He proposed to found sixteen: but having disposed too lavishly of the lands destined at first for their endow∣ment, he erected only six bishoprics, viz. of Chester, Westminster, Oxford, Bristol, Gloucester and Peter∣borough. There were libraries well furnished with books in several of the abbeys: and out of the great regard he had for learning, he employed the famous antiquary John Leland to visit them, and take care of preserving the most valuable manuscripts, and choicest monuments of antiquity. He had proposed several other noble foundations, particularly of a col∣lege for the study of the civil law, and the purity of the Latin and French tongues, and the knowledge of foreign affairs, in order to serve for a seminary of mi∣nisters of state, and ambassadors in foreign countries. There could not be a more favourable opportunity than was now offered for such institutions: but Henry's own prodigality, and the greedy appetites of his cour∣tiers, prevented this, and other of his best designs.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<P>He was not fonder of multiplying his treasure, than he was, either of extending his prerogative, or of shewing his absolute power. Of the first kind was the act<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stat. 31 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE> for making proclamations, issued by the King, for the time being, with the advice of council, full as binding upon the subject (in case his estate, liberty, or person did not suffer by them) as acts of parliament. Of the later kind was the act of attainder, not only against the Marquis of Exeter, the Lords Montacute, Darcy, and Hussey, Sir E. Nevil, Sir N. Carew, Sir Robert Constable, Sir J. Bullmer, Sir Francis Biggot, Sir T. Percy, Sir Stephen Hammerton, the abbots or priors of Whalley, Woburne, Kirksted, Barlings, Jor∣vaux, Bridlington and Lenton, with other gentlemen and ecclesiastics, who had been legally convicted, either for treasonable practices, or for being concerned in the late rebellion, but against others likewise who had not been so convicted. Prosecutions indeed had been carried on against Cardinal Pole, Michael Throck∣morton, J. Hilyard, T. Goldwell, and W. Payto, for adhering to the Bishop of Rome, taking promo∣tion from him, and stirring up rebellion in England: and they had been all found guilty. But this does not seem to have been the case of Sir Adrian Fortes∣cue, Sir Thomas Dingley, and several others, attainted by the same act, as confederates with the persons con∣victed; there being no mention of any proofs produced against them, or of their having undergone any trial. Nothing certainly could be more arbitrary, or more dangerous to the life, liberty, and property of every subject, than the attainder of these persons without so much as being heard: though all writers reserve their exclamations on this head, to the case of Marga∣ret Pole Countess of Salisbury, who yet seems to have been sometime before<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE> found guilty of a correspon∣dence with her son the Cardinal (several of whose
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>letters, with some papal bulls, were found in her cabinet) at the same time that Gertrude Marchio∣ness of Exeter was also convicted. When the bill of attainder was depending in the house of Lords<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. 652.</NOTE>, Cromwell produced there a tunic of white silk, found among the Countess's linen, on the front whereof were painted the arms of England, and in the back part, the five wounds of Christ, or the in∣signia on the banner of the late northern rebels. Ger∣trude was pardoned at the later end of this year; but Margaret, after being two years in prison, was be∣headed.</P>
<P>Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Act of the six Articles, or the statute of blood.</NOTE> had been ambassador several years abroad, either at the French or Imperial courts; and had in that time probably reconciled himself to the Pope<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. 251.</NOTE>, whose interests he secretly favoured. He was an artful man, knew the King perfectly well, and chose always proper seasons for moving him in any point, that he wanted to carry. He had done no great service in his embassies, and had left the courts, where he had been employed, out of humour with Henry: to whom he represented, that it was owing to the suspicion they had entertained of his deviating not only from the government of the church of Rome, but from the faith there received, and nothing would re-establish a good understanding with them so easily, as by shewing his zeal for the received doctrines. Others about court, who were concealed friends of the papacy, improved this suggestion; and put the King upon hearing the cause of Lambert before-men∣tioned. His Majesty's arguments, learning, and judg∣ment were extolled to the skies; and to convince the world of his adherence to the Roman faith, six arti∣cles, much controverted at that time, and some of them rejected by the Lutherans, were to be established
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>by parliament, under the severest penalties.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lords Journals.</NOTE> On May 5 it was referred to Cromwell, the two Arch∣bishops, the Bishops of Durham, Bath, Carlisle, Ely, Bangor, and Worcester, to consider how to extirpate the diversity of opinions in matter of religion: but, they not agreeing in their sentiments, the Duke of Nor∣folk, on the sixteenth of that month, moved the House of Lords, that six articles, which he had to propose, should be examined in full parliament, where every person might speak his opinion, that so a determina∣tion might be made, and a penal statute enacted, for the better observation thereof. The articles were pro∣posed by way of questions; and after several debates, in which the King bore a share, the Lords and Com∣mons in parliament<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stat. 31. Hen. VIII. c. 14.</NOTE>, and the clergy in convocation, agreed,
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. That, in the sacrament of the altar, the natural body and blood of Christ, conceived of the Virgin Mary, is really present, under the form of bread and wine; and that, after the consecration, there remains no sub∣stance of bread or wine, nor any other substance, but the substance of Christ, God and Man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the com∣munion in both kinds is not necessary for salvation, by the law of God, to all persons; and that the very blood is in the flesh under the form of bread, and the very flesh in the blood under the form of wine, as well apart, as if they were both together.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That priests, after their ordination, might not marry by the law of God; and that by the same law,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. vows of chastity by man or woman were to be observed, and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. pri∣vate masses, as well as,</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. auricular confession, were necessary to be continued."</ITEM>
</LIST> By the bill brought in, pursuant to this determination, all that, after next July 12, should preach, dispute, or speak, against the doctrines of either transubstantiation or concomitancy, were to be judged heretics, and, without any abjura∣tion, be burnt immediately, and their estates forfeited as in cases of high treason. Whoever obstinately
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>maintained any thing contrary to the other articles, was to be punished as if guilty of felony: as priests also were, and such as had vowed chastity, if they married. The bare declaring of a person's opinion on the same heads, contrary to the act, was punishable in the first offence by the forfeiture of goods and chattels, and in the second was made capital. The marriages of priests were to be declared null, and if they lay, or openly conversed with their wives, after July 12, it was made felony. Such as kept other women, for∣feited their preferment, and if afterwards they repeated their offence, were to be hanged as felons; the women, with whom they committed the offence, being to suffer the same punishment. Abstaining from confession, and from receiving the eucharist at the accustomed times, subjected a person to fine and imprisonment at the King's pleasure, and, after a second conviction, to death and forfeiture, as in cases of felony.</P>
<P>Such was the cruel act of the six articles, incon∣sistent in some points with what Henry had recom∣mended formerly; but expedient for him, at this juncture, to convince foreign Princes of his catholicity. It was to be read once a quarter, in every parish-church throughout the kingdom: and commissioners were ap∣pointed, in every county, to put it rigorously in exe∣cution. Shaxton and Latimer, as soon as it passed, re∣signed the sees of Chichester and Worcester. The adherents of the papacy were so intent upon its exe∣cution, that they got 500 persons to be taken up immediately: but Cromwell, representing the evil con∣sequences of so violent a proceeding, procured a pardon for them; only the two prelates were long confined in prison. Cranmer had opposed the act to the last<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 249, 266, 270. in Coll. No. 11. 15.</NOTE>; and, when his reasons could not prevail to throw it out, gave his vote against its passing, though the King would have excused his absence. His ene∣mies,
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>imagined, that they had got a great advantage over him, and an handle for working his ruin: but, sending away his wife to her uncle Osiander in Ger∣many, he went on in his old way, addressing the King with his usual frankness and sincerity, which had at first recommended him to Henry, and still continued him in his good graces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Besides the sanguinary act above-mentioned, the parliament passed two other remarkable statutes, viz. for settling the prece∣dency and ranks of the peers and great officers of state; by which Cromwell, though the son of a blacksmith, or brewer, at Putney, obtained the first place after the Princes of the blood: and for enable∣ing the religious of dissolved monasteries to hold lands and tenements, and to sue and be sued in all actions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Private per∣sons allowed to have Bibles in their fami∣lies.</NOTE> There appeared soon after a very remark∣able effect of Cranmer's credit with the King. He obtained, on November 13, letters-pa∣tent, under the great seal for allowing all persons to purchase English Bibles, and keep them in their houses. The Bible, translated into English by the royal authority, had been printed the foregoing year by Richard Graf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on at London; and the King had paid for 1500 copies of the impression. One of these was to be placed in every church, chained so as not to be embezzled; to be read by all persons within his dominions, without controul or hazard; for which Cromwell had got the King's war∣rant. What Cranmer obtained, was a more general liberty: and whereas before a single copy served for the use of a whole parish, every parishioner was now enabled to have a Bible for his own family, to read it at leisure, to examine it carefully, to compare one passage with another, and to consider upon the whole what was the true meaning of any part of scripture. As nothing contributed more to the reformation, than the knowledge of the scriptures, it is easy to imagine how serviceable the free use of them, thus procured
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>by Cranmer, was to that end, by making them more generally known to the people.</P>
<P>A. D. 1540.] The exterior marks of a perfect union between the Emperor and Francis,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Henry mar∣ries and di∣vorces Anne of Cleves.</NOTE> alarmed the King of England to the highest degree. He suspected some de∣sign had been formed between them to his prejudice: and resolved, as well to unite with the German Pro∣testants, if they would come to some accord in points of religion, as to marry Anne of Cleves. When she landed at Rochester the King went thither incognito to see her, and found her so different from her picture, which had been drawn by Hans Holbein, that, in the impatience of his disappointment, he swore they had brought him a <HI>Flanders mare.</HI> Nevertheless, re∣flecting that her brother the Duke of Cleves was the Emperor's neighbour in the Low Countries, and his competitor for the duchy of Guelderland; and that her sister was married to the Duke of Saxony, chief of the league of Smalcalde; and that the Emperor was then at Paris negotiating with the French Monarch; he would not run the risk of affronting two such powerful Princes, at a time when he might stand in need of their assistance; and therefore he wed∣ded Anne on January 6 at Greenwich. After that so∣lemnity, the royal pair were bedded: but this, instead of curing the aversion he had contracted for her at first sight, only served to augment it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The day after the nuptials, when Cromwell asked Henry how he liked his new bed-fellow, his Majesty declared to him in confi∣dence, that he liked her worse than ever; that he suspected she was no maid; that she had unsavoury smells about her; and that he believed he should never be able to consummate his marriage.</NOTE>. He re∣solved to be divorced from her at any rate: and he was the more encouraged to take that step, because, having sent the Duke of Norfolk, after the Emperor had quitted France, to make a league with Francis, he had found the last of these Princes very diffident of
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>the other, and disposed enough to renew hostilities; though he did not care to come to an open rupture, till he knew the fate of the promised investiture of Milan. Princes seldom want pretences for executing any of their resolutions: and a pre-contract for a mar∣riage between Anne of Cleves and the young Prince of Lorrain, was now made use of to invalidate Henry's marriage. It doth not appear, whether that contract was made in words of the present or future tense, or whether it was more than a bare agreement or destina∣tion of their parents: if it was, the proofs, said to be produced of its being afterwards set aside, by an∣other convention or agreement of the same parents, or by a declaration of the Duke of Gueldres, who in∣termeddled in the affair, were not sufficient to destroy its obligation. However this matter was, the parlia∣ment which met on April 12, thought fit, on July 6, to address the King, that he would give orders for a trial of the validity of his marriage: and a commis∣sion was immediately issued for its being tried in the convocation. Two days were spent in examining witnesses to prove, "that there had been a pre-con∣tract between the Queen and the Prince of Lorrain; that the King had married her against his will, and without the inward consent of his mind; and that the marriage had not been consummated." The proof of this last particular rested chiefly upon Henry's own disposition, though it was what the Queen her∣self also acknowledged; canonists had often set aside marriages on all these accounts: and matters of this nature being usually submitted to their judgment, the convocation, in which great numbers of that profession sat, agreed unanimously, on July 9, in pronouncing the King's marriage null and invalid. This sentence was delivered the next day in writing to the two houses of parliament; and Henry sent the day following, the Lord Chancellor, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Southampton, and the Bishop of Winchester, to give
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>the Queen an account of what had been done; and to assure her, that he would, by letters-patent, declare her his adopted sister; a title giving her precedence before all the ladies of England, except his Queen and daughters; and would settle on her for life the palace of Richmond, with a revenue of 3000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per annum,</HI> which she might enjoy either in England, or abroad, at her option. Anne was naturally dull and phlegmatic, altogether unskilled in music, which was always agreeable to Henry: and as she had found very little matrimonial comfort or satisfaction, readily ac∣cepted the offer; signed her consent, and approba∣tion of the sentence; and chose to live in England, rather than to return, thus disgraced, into her own country. She wrote likewise to her brother, expressing her approbation of what had been done; extolling the King's goodness to her; desiring him and her other friends not to take the matter ill; and hoping it would cause no interruption of their friendship. A bill was, on July 12, brought into parliament, for annulling the marriage, and allowing the parties to marry again, pursuant to the sentence of the convocation: and it readily passed both houses.</P>
<P>The King lost no time in making use of the liberty of re-marrying;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Henry weds Catherine Howard.</NOTE> and having privately espoused Catherine, daughter of the Lord Edmond Howard, brother to the Duke of Norfolk, declared her publickly his Queen, on August 8, at Hampton-Court.</P>
<P>The fall of Cromwell, happening at the same time as the divorce, is generally imputed to the great hand he had in making the match with Anne of Cleves, and to the King's resentment on that account. Henry was certainly much out of humour on that occasion, and had abundant reason to complain of such as had abused him by false representations of her beauty and perfections; yet none of these, nor any one else con∣cerned in advising or transacting the marriage, besides
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>Cromwell, ever felt any effects of his anger. It seems much more natural to ascribe both these events to the power of the imperial faction in the court of England, particularly to the Duke of Norfolk, and to the new passion which the King had entertained for this noble∣man's niece, Catherine Howard; who now served him as effectually for the ruin of Cromwell, as Anne Bo∣leyn, another of his nieces, had formerly for that of Wolsey. The match with Cleves was considered as an introduction to a league with the Protestant Princes of Germany; which would have defeated all the Em∣peror's schemes for rendering himself absolute in that country: it behoved this Prince to set all his agents and partizans at work to defeat this alliance, and pre∣vent the effects it might reasonably be supposed to produce. The Duke of Norfolk had been always in his interests; and served him very well at this juncture: he was an utter enemy to the German league, because it was very likely to promote a reformation, to which he was extremely averse. He had lately at Archbishop Cranmer's table quarrelled with Cromwell; and used such bitter sarcasms and outrageous language to him, as could not easily be digested, and were plain decla∣rations of the mortal hatred he bore to this minister, whose highest post then was that of Lord Privy Seal. This violent proceeding might perhaps tempt people to think, that the Duke was able to carry his point against Cromwell, especially since he had got Stephen Gardiner Bishop of Winchester, Cuthbert Tonstal of Durham, and John Clark of Bath, recalled to court, and sworn of the privy council; designing the last for the post of Lord Privy Seal, and the second for vicar-general. The servants of the minister, whose spoils were thus to be disposed of, were of opinion, that though their master might not keep the title of vicar-general (which was generally odious) yet he would maintain his credit with the King, being very assiduous in his affairs, and doing nothing without first com∣municating
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>it to his Majesty. Whatever efforts were made against him, Cromwell doth not seem to have been sunk at all in his master's good graces, when the parliament met on April 12; having but two days before obtained from him a grant of thirty manors, parcel of the possessions of several dissolved monasteries. On the seventeenth of the month, he was created Earl of Essex, and, in a day or two after, Lord High Chamberlain of England (dignities that had fallen va∣cant, in the foregoing month, by the extinction of the male line of the Bourchiers, and the death of John Vere Earl of Oxford); and his son Gregory, being called up by writ to the house of Lords, took his place there as Lord Cromwell, the same day his father was introduced into it by his new title of Essex. The bill for suppressing the knights of the order of <HI>St. John of Jerusalem</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before the taking of Jerusalem from the Saracens, certain Chris∣tian merchants of Naples got leave, in 1012, from the Caliph of Egypt, to erect, for the entertainment of themselves and their countrymen, a small house and oratory near the church of the holy sepulchre. To them repaired certain canons of the order of <HI>St. Augustin,</HI> who built another oratory; but the number of the pilgrims increasing, they erected a large hospital on the spot where our Saviour celebrated the paschal supper; and taking St. John Baptist for their patron, were called <HI>Hospitallers of</HI> St. John <HI>of Jerusalem.</HI> By assistance from Eu∣rope, they opposed the attacks of the Infidels till 1099, when God∣frey of Bouillon came to their relief, and took the holy city from the Egyptian Caliph. Their order was confirmed before 1117, by Pope Pascal II. who granted them, by special order, the sole right of electing a superior, after the death of Gerhard the then superior, who enjoined that the religious of his order should wear a plain black robe with a white linen cross of eight points affixed to it. Upon Gerhard's de∣cease, A.D. 1118, the hospitallers elected Raimond Dupuy, a Florentine, for their head; and he was the first who took the title of grand-master. They entertained poor pilgrims in their hospital at Jerusalem, keeping the passage thither safe; and charitably buried the dead. They were at first very lowly, their m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster stiling himself <HI>servant to he poor ser∣vitors of the hospital of Jerusalem:</HI> but, by the bounty and devotion of Princes and private persons, they had, about the year 1240, no less than 19,000 lordships and manors in different parts of Christendom. After they were totally expelled from Palestine in 1291, they took up their residence in Cyprus until the year 1310, when they made themselves masters of Rhodes, and from the conquest of that island were stiled <HI>Knights of Rhodes.</HI> This title they preserved together with their ha∣bitation until the year 1522, when Solyman II. Emperor of the Turks, subdued their island: after which the grand-master went to Rome, and the rest of the knights were dispersed in divers places, until the Emperor Charles V. gave them the isle of Malta, to hold in fief of him, by charter dated March 24, 1530, and then they assumed the stile of <HI>Knights of Malta,</HI> which they still maintain. The order formerly consisted of eight tongues or nations, but now only of seven, since England separated from the church of Rome. The heads of each nation, or the grand-crosses, are called grand-priors, each having convents of knights, and estates appropriated for their maintenance, in every Popish nation: and by them the grand-masters are elected. The knights, who are computed to be about 3000 in number, and must be of antient noble families, are subject in spirituals to the Pope, and live according to the rule of St. Augustin. They are, among other engagements, obliged to sup∣port a continual war against the Mahometans, and also against pi∣rates; for which they are often denominated the champions of Chris∣tendom. Their chief residence, in England, was at Clerkenwell near London. It was founded by John Briset, and in time became so great, that it resembled a palace, and had a fine church, and a tower-steeple, of curious workmanship, raised so high, that, while it stood, it was a singular ornament to the city. The grand-prior in England was reputed the first baron of the land. When the templars were extirpated, in the reign of Edward II. they got a gift of their possessions; and outlived all the religious orders in England, until they were this year abolished on pretence of their dependence on the Pope and Emperor. All their effects in England and Ireland were confiscated to the King, who allowed 3000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> yearly for their sub∣sistence; of which 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> were allotted to Sir William Weston, the grand-prior, who was so affected with the dissolution of his priory, that he did not live to receive his pension, and lies buried in Clerken∣well church. The remaining 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> were distributed among the other members, in appointments from 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> according to their several qualities and deserts.</NOTE>, and a grant of four fifteenths and tenths
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>to be paid in as many years, and of two subsidies, each a shilling in the pound, are ascribed to his ma∣nagement; and he appears to have acted as principal minister all the session, till May 14; when the parlia∣ment (on account of the festival of Whitsuntide, and to allow the Bishops and clergy time to finish their instructions for the union of the Christian world) was
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>prorogued to the twenty-fifth of that month. Nor doth there appear to have been any change in his situ∣ation when the parliament met again, nor even any formed resolution for vacating the King's marriage with Anne of Cleves (whatever wishes or designs of that kind Henry might have before entertained) since, on the day last named, a bill was brought into the house of Peers, for settling a jointure on her as Queen of England, and passed <HI>nemine contradicente.</HI></P>
<P>It appears by Cromwell's letter, wrote in the Tower, on Saturday June 12, that, within the past fortnight, the Queen's German maid-servants had been sent away; that he had used instances with her Lord Chamberlain, and others of her council, to persuade her to a better behaviour towards his Majesty; and that the King had entrusted to him a matter of secresy relating to her, which he was charged with revealing, though he vin∣dicated himself very well from that accusation. But these passages do not account sufficiently for that mi∣nister's sudden fall, and the Queen's as sudden divorce; which, happening together, seem to have been the con∣sequence of a simultaneous resolution: and yet what else fell out within that space of time, is matter of pro∣bable conjecture, rather than absolute certainty, through the silence of cotemporary writers on the subject. These writers take notice of Cromwell's low birth, and his being raised, purely by the strength and merit of his natural parts, without any education or the support of friends, to the highest dignities and trusts in the kingdom; which consequently exposed him to the envy of the nobility, even if he had been less haughty than he is represented. They observe that the share he had in the suppression of monasteries, and in pro∣moting the reformation, had rendered him odious to all the Popish party; that even the reformed were dis∣contented with him, when they found he could not pro∣tect them from burning; and that the common peo∣ple hated him for having gotten from the parliament,
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>against their wills, the late above-mentioned grants of a subsidy, and four fifteenths and tenths, besides an∣other subsidy of four shillings in the pound from the clergy, at a time when they imagined themselves secure from the danger of new taxes, by the vast aug∣mentation which the lands of dissolved monasteries had made of the crown revenues. These, after all, were no reasons why the King should treat a minister of his abi∣lities, who had done him such extraordinary services, in the manner he did; though perhaps they might encourage his enemies to accuse him of having, in others, acted without the King's express knowledge or licence. It was impossible for any man, who had med∣dled so much in great and public affairs, not to mis∣take, forget, or err in various cases and manners, so as to be obnoxious in point of law, when a severe in∣quisition should be made into his conduct. Thus he was accused, "of setting persons at liberty, who had either been convicted of misprision of treason, upon the late statutes, or were in prison upon suspicion of treason; of granting licences for carrying corn, leather, beer, tallow, and other commodities, out of the realm, con∣trary to the King's proclamation, and for persons to go abroad, with horses, and money, without search; and of deputing commissioners in weighty cases within the realm, without his knowledge or assent, and in confi∣dence of his approbation." No mention is made of any particular instance of these offences, which would probably have appeared upon accusation to be inconsi∣derable matters, if not strictly justifiable: and to touch his life, it was necessary to charge him with heresy and treason. To support the first of these charges it was said, "That he had dispersed over the realm erro∣neous books, printed as well abroad as in England, about the sacrament of the altar, and other articles of religion, pronouncing the doctrines therein to be good, and saying every Christian might administer the sacra∣ment, as well as a priest; that he had, as the King's
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>Vicegerent in ecclesiastical affairs, licensed, without his knowledge, several persons, detected or suspected of heresy, to preach openly; that he had ordered many heretics, some indicted, others apprehended on the complaints of credible persons, to be set at liberty; that he had screened heretics, specially accused, from punishment, and had either imprisoned or rebuked the accusers so sharply, that people were afraid of inform∣ing against heretics." The charge of treason was founded upon the overt-act of drawing out his dagger, to give an emphasis to some words he was said to have spoken, two years before, in private conversation, ex∣pressing a resolution "to stand by the cause of the reformation, in the field, sword-in-hand, against the King and all others." These he absolutely denied; nor were they indeed consistent with that temper, modera∣tion, and prudence, which were remarkable in all his actions: and as they were laid at that distance of time, by persons who had not seen him afterwards, and had been so long concealed, there is a good deal of reason to think they were invented purely to furnish his ene∣mies with a pretence to take away the life of a minister, whose abilities and eminent services rendered him a for∣midable rival, even under disgrace.</P>
<P>These were the pretences for putting Cromwell to death: but the resolution for that step, and for the Queen's divorce, was probably owing to other motives. The Emperor had long wished to be reconciled to Henry, and had amused him with various offers to engage him in his interest, and in an alliance against France: and his ambassadors, at the court of England, watched and improved all opportunities for that purpose. A very fair one was at this time furnished them by the King of France; who, too desirous to oblige the Emperor in his late passage thro' that kingdom, had, in the open∣ness of his heart, made him a confident of all the most secret particulars that had passed in his negotiations with Henry, and of all the offers which this Prince had
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>made to engage him in a league against the house of Austria. Francis soon repented of this indiscretion; and the ill-humour it put him in, occasioned the dis∣grace of his favourite ministers, the Constable de Mont∣morency and Admiral Chabot. Henry could never forgive it; and the discovery thereof was the principal means made use of by the Emperor, to draw the King of England over to his interests, and to engage him af∣terwards in an alliance against Francis. The discovery appears, from all circumstances, to have been made about this time; and Henry resolving, in the height of his resentment, to unite with the Emperor, had no occasion for a league with the Protestant Princes of Germany, to which his religious principles rendered him averse, and nothing but the necessity of his affairs could make him submit. It happened at the same time that he took a liking to Catherine Howard, who had beauty enough to strike his fancy: and though she had neither virtue, nor a constitution, capable of holding out long against a Prince's courtship; yet Gardiner, and the Duke of Norfolk, with her other relations, managed matters so well, that the King grew enamour∣ed of her person. His passions, ever violent, made him impatient to enjoy the object beloved; Catherine had reasons to have her marriage hurried over privately, before the King's flame for her came to be the subject of public discourse: her relations, knowing how much Henry was influenced by the wives he liked, pushed it on with all their credit, and incited him to remove the obstacles to his happiness, by vacating his marriage with Anne of Cleves, and by destroying the author of it, who had drawn him into the noose, and whose ruin was necessary to their security. The King never scru∣pled any measures, nor minded the consequences there∣of, when his will was in question; obstructions served only to whet his fury for removing them: hence arose the resolution for the divorce of Anne, the private
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>marriage of Catherine, and the getting rid of Crom∣well.</P>
<P>This minister was, on Friday, June 11, about three in the afternoon, arrested by the Chancellor and Lords of the privy council, in the King's palace at West∣minster; and carried thence to the Tower of London. His fortitude seemed to forsake him at this juncture: being required to send to the King a full account of his transactions in his Majesty's marriage with Anne of Cleves, he concluded his letter in the most abject man∣ner. He subscribed himself a most woeful prisoner, ready to take the death, when it should please God and his Majesty; yet, he said, the frail flesh incited him continually to call to his grace for mercy, and grace for his offences. He dated the letter "At the Tower, this Wednesday the last of June, with the heavy heart and trembling hand of your Highness's most heavy and most miserable prisoner, and poor slave, Thomas Cromwell:" and below the subscription he wrote, "Most gracious Prince, I cry for mercy, mercy, mercy." His enemies had cooked up a charge against him; but conscious of the weakness of their proofs, at least in the capital articles, and fearing that what irregularities had been committed in the execution of his offices, might appear, on examination, to have been for the King's service, and, perhaps, agreeable to the general tenor of his commands and instructions, did not care that he should be admitted to make his defence. A shorter method, against which no inno∣cence could be proof, was taken: a bill for his at∣tainder was brought, on June 17, into the house of Lords; and, being passed after three readings, was sent on the 19th to the Commons for their concurrence. This was not so readily granted as might have been expected; ten days passed before the Commons sent back (as was usually done in such cases) the bill, which they did not approve: but they sent with it a new bill of their own framing, which they had passed, and an∣nexed
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>to it a proviso about the deanery of Wells. This new bill, coming up to the Lords on the 26th, was read thrice, and the proviso as often, the same day, and passed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir E. Coke says he was told by Sir T. Gaudy, a Justice at that time of the King's Bench, that Cromwell had, some time before, been ordered by the King to attend the Chief Justices, and ask their opinions, "Whether a man in prison, and forth-coming, might be attainted by parliament, without being called to answer?" And the Judges, after saying, "It was a dangerous question, and they thought a parliament would never do it," being pressed to a more direct reply, declared their opinion, "That if he was attained by parliament, it could not be questioned, whether he was called to answer or not." The relation adds, "That the party against whom this was intended was never questioned: and the first man that suf∣fered by that proceeding was Cromwell himself." This story seems calculated to lessen the horror of that minister's treatment: but, if it be true, it doth no great honour to the Judges; who must be very ignorant, if they did not know, that the attainders of Roger Morti∣mer, Earl of Marche, and of several others, by parliament, had been repealed on this very account, of the parties not being called to an∣swer, nor heard in their defence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Cromwell's chief fault was an excess of obsequious∣ness to the King's pleasures, the effect of an inordinate zeal for his master's service. In other respects, he is scarce sufficiently to be admired, for his prodigious parts, excellent judgment, infinite application to bu∣siness, wonderful dexterity in the management of af∣fairs, great moderation in the exercise of his authority, calmness of temper in his dealings with all persons, and under provocations sufficient to ruffle the sedatest per∣son; an uncommon generosity and nobleness of mind, notwithstanding the meanness of his extraction, and for an unexampled condescension in the height of his pomp, vouchsafing to take notice of his old acquain∣tance, and shew his gratitude for favours formerly re∣ceived. A minister in disgrace finds few persons gene∣rous enough to intercede in his behalf: Cranmer was the only one that discharged the part of a true friend on this occasion, having written a very moving letter
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>to the King in his behalf, declaring his firm belief of Cromwell's innocence from any disloyal meaning, and wishing his Majesty might find another counsellor equal to him in capacity, diligence, and fidelity. There were few such to be met with; and the King is said afterwards to have lamented his loss. The parlia∣ment was dissolved on July 24, after passing some other acts for the attainder of Lord Hungerford, and seve∣ral other persons; for the regulating sanctuaries, and reducing their number; and for repealing the penalty of death, denounced by the statute of the six articles, against incontinent priests and their women. They likewise passed an act, ordaining, that a marriage, al∣ready consummated, should not be dissolved on ac∣count of any pre-contract, unconsummated, or any other hindrances than those of the divine law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This statute, which so palpably contradicted the King's own conduct in the cases of his wives, was intended as a previous step to∣wards legitimating the Princess Elizabeth, and his marriage with Catherine Howard, who was cousin-german to Anne Boleyn: for, by the canon law, a marriage in that degree was prohibited, with∣out a special dispensation first obtained.</NOTE>. The commissioners, appointed by his Majesty to examine the doctrines of religion, having drawn up a long re∣port upon that subject, a statute was enacted, imply∣ing, that their report should have the force of a law, as well as every thing that the King should ordain con∣cerning religion. By this act they subjected their con∣sciences to the will and pleasure of their Sovereign, and vested him with that infallibility which they denied to the Pope. This complaisant assembly also passed an act for erecting a court of wards, and at last one for a general amnesty, from which were excepted the Coun∣tess of Salisbury and Cromwell, as well as those con∣victed of having denied the King's supremacy, or having violated any of the articles of the statute of blood.</P>
<P>Besides the before-mentioned letter, dated the last of
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>June, Cromwell wrote another to Henry in such a pathetic strain,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Death of Cromwell and Lord Hungerford.</NOTE> that his Majesty seemed affected with it, and caused it to be read thrice over in his hearing: but these impressions were effaced by the insinuations of the Duke of Norfolk and Bishop Gardiner; and a warrant was granted for beheading Thomas Cromwell, late Earl of Essex, on Tower-hill, on July 28. When he was brought to the scaffold, his regard for his son prevented him from expatiating upon his own inno∣cence. He thanked God for bringing him to that death for his transgressions: he acknowledged his of∣fences against God and his Prince, and confessed that he had been seduced, but that now he died in the Ca∣tholic faith. Then he desired the bye-standers to pray for the King, the Prince, and for himself; and having spent some time in private devotion, submitted his neck to the executioner, who mangled him in a shocking manner. Walter Lord Hungerford suffered at the same time, for sorcery, treason, and beastiality.</P>
<P>Henry was very rigid in causing the bloody statute, or the act of the six articles, to be put in execution; and Papists and the Reformed equally felt the fury of his displeasure, as head of the church. Among the persons attainted in the last session of parliament, there were three for denying his Majesty's supremacy, and as many for professing the doctrines of Protestantism. The first were Edward Powel, Thomas Abel, and Richard Featherstone; and the latter, Robert Barnes, Doctor of Divinity, with William Jerome, and Thomas Gerard, Bachelors of Divinity. These were drawn, one of each sort tied together, on hurdles to Smith∣field; where the Papists were hanged, and the Pro∣testants burned. In the preceding year, a man and a woman, Anabaptists, were committed to the flames in the same place; and four persons of the same profession, three men and a woman, all Dutch, as well as the other two, bore faggots at St. Paul's cross, to testify
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>their recantation and abhorrence of their former tenets.</P>
<P>The year 1540 is also memorable for a bull granted by Pope Paul III. confirming the order of the Jesuits, lately founded by Ignatius Loyola.</P>
<P>A. D. 1541.] The King of England was, in the mean time, intent upon the reformation he proposed in religion: and the sum of it having been drawn up in <HI>The necessary erudition of a Christian Man,</HI> this book was published by authority, and recommended to all persons, as a rule for directing their belief and practice. It contained an account of the Christian covenant, with an exposition of the Apostles creed, the Lord's prayer, the Ave-Maria, the ten command∣ments, and the sacraments: and, though the number of these last, and the doctrines relating to them, were asserted therein, agreeable to what had been determined in the statute of the six articles, yet the worship of saints, pilgrimages, and other ceremonies, were con∣demned. The King's supremacy in ecclesiastical mat∣ters was explained so as to prevent offence being taken at his title of <HI>head;</HI> the Pope's pretensions were refuted; the holy Catholic church was defined to be an aggre∣gate body, "comprehending all assemblies of men over the whole world, that received the faith of Christ; who ought to hold an unity of love and brotherly a∣greement together, by which they become members of the Catholic church;" and the unreasonableness of placing its unity in a submission to the Bishop of Rome, is fully shewed. Sinners were taught to depend wholly on the merits of Christ; unlearned people were exhort∣ed to pray in their mother-tongue; and a foundation laid for a further reformation, by declaring, "every national church to be a compleat body within itself, with power to reform heresies, correct abuses, and do every thing else necessary for keeping itself pure, and governing its members." To complete his designs for the instruction of his subjects, he caused a new im∣pression
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>of the English Bible to be made: and in May this year, issued strict injunctions, enforced with pe∣nalties, that every parish, throughout the realm, should purchase one, to be kept in the church, before All-hallow ride.</P>
<P>His Majesty had before erected Westminster into an ep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pal see, and assigned all the county of Middle-sex, except the parish of Fulham, for its diocese: and he now founded the bishoprics of Chester, Gloucester, and Peterborough; to which were added, in the next year, those of Bristol and Oxford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Thirlby was the first and only Bishop of Westminster: the see of Chester was filled by John Bird, translated from Bangor: John Wakeman, the last Abbot of Tewskesbury, was consecrated Bishop of Gloucester: John Chambers, who had been Abbot, was promoted to the see, of Peterborough: Paul Bush was made Bishop of Bristol; and Robert King, last Abbot of Ofney, got the cathedral chair of Oxford.</NOTE>. The priories too of cathedrals were converted into deaneries, and col∣leges of prebendaries; the lands of dissolved monaste∣ries being assigned for these endo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></P>
<P>This application of a small part of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey lands, to proper uses, did not prevent an insurrection in the north; where the Romish ceremonies had taken the deepest root, and the ejected religious had the greatest influence. It began in April, but was soon suppressed; Sir John Nevil, and about ten more, who put them∣selves at the head of the country people, being taken and put to death at York; and three others executed at London. This inconsiderable rebellion was gene∣rally imputed to Cardinal Pole's intrigues: and either for this offence of her son, or for some fresh provoca∣tion of her own, the old Countess of Salisbury, who had been kept in prison two years after her conviction and attainder, was beheaded, on May 27, in the Tower of London. The Lord Leonard Grey, bro∣ther to the Marquis of Dorset, was, in the next month, indicted for some treasonable practices with the Irish,
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>whilst he was Deputy of Ireland, and for engaging to join Reginald Pole: he pleaded guilty, and was also beheaded.</P>
<P>A more lamentable fate attended Thomas Fiennes, Lord Dacres; who being drawn in, by some disorderly persons, to go and hunt by night in the park of Laugh∣ton in Sussex, belonging to Sir Nicholas Pelham, was, in the way thither, engaged in an accidental fray, and one of the adverse party being mortally wounded, and dying about a month after, this young nobleman was tried by his peers for that offence. It was in the eye of the law no more than manslaughter; but he, confessing the fact, without considering the indictment had been laid for murder, was found guilty, and condemned to be hanged at Tyburn; the sentence being accordingly executed upon him, as well as on three gentlemen his accomplices.</P>
<P>The journey which the King made, in August, to Yorkshire, was not so much to extinguish the remains of the late rebellion, as to destroy all monuments of superstition, pretended miracles, and pilgrimages. Upon his arrival at York, he issued a proclamation, encouraging every body who had been injured by any of his officers, to bring their complaints before him and his council, and assuring them of redress: but this was not the sole end of his progress. He had, in the beginning of the last year, sent Ralph Sadler to Edin∣burgh, with instructions to press James V. to remove Cardinal Beton from his councils, to seize the lands of monasteries into his own hands, to enter into a stricter amity with him, and to agree upon an inter∣view between them, for the settling of this amity more effectually. James excused himself as to the two first particulars, having no objection to the Cardinal's con∣duct, nor any temptation to seize the revenues of the religious, who were always ready to supply him with money for his occasions; but professed a firm resolu∣tion to live always in friendship with his uncle, and
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>consented to an interview. This was now to be held at York, and Henry had caused great preparations to be made there for his nephew's reception: but the Cardinal, and the Scotch prelates, took care to pre∣vent a meeting, which they imagined would prove fa∣tal to the clergy of Scotland. They were apprehen∣sive, that Henry might, in a personal conference, pre∣vail on his nephew to take the steps which had been refused on the motion of his ambassadors; and made use not only of all the credit they had with their ma∣ster, as being his ministers, and employed in all the affairs of his realm, but of large promises to divert him from keeping his engagement with Henry. James, tempted by the assurance of 30,000 crowns a-year be∣ing paid him duly by the clergy, who were ready in any difficulty to assist him with all their fortunes, and by the prospect of more than 100,000 crowns a-year, which they undertook to raise for him by the forfei∣tures of heretics, did not come to the interview; which was considered as a plain declaration of his hostile mind, and that he intended to keep no measures with his uncle. Henry, disappointed, deluded, and full of re∣sentment, quitted York at the latter end of September; and, continuing his progress through several counties, returned to London, where he was informed of matters that gave him still greater uneasiness.</P>
<P>Whilst the King was in his progress,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen Catherine Howard accused of incontinence.</NOTE> one John Lassels had given the Arch∣bishop of Canterbury an account, that a sister of his, who had been a servant to Agnes Duchess-dowager of Norfolk, under whom Catherine Howard had been brought up, had assured him, that this Lady, now Queen, was very lewd; that Francis Derham, a servant in the family, had lain in bed with her, in his doublet and hose, between the sheets, an hundred nights; three female servants be∣ing, at different times, in bed with her, whilst they indulged themselves in such dalliances; and that one
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>Mannock (some time also in the service of the Duchess) had been admitted to the like familiarities, and knew a private mark in her body. The Archbishop con∣sulting the Lord Chancellor and the Earl of Hertford, who had been left by the King to manage affairs in London during his absence, they both agreed that he should acquaint his Majesty with it: and the matter being of such a nature, that he could not well express it by word of mouth, he drew up the information in writing, and, on November 2, presented it to the King. Henry, who had pretended to a wonderful sagacity in the case of Anne of Cleves, had expressed no suspicion of want of virginity in Catherine Howard, and was still so much in love with her, that, having the day before received mass, he had then given thanks to God for the good life he had led, and hoped to lead, with her; and desired his confessor, John Long∣land, Bishop of Lincoln, to join with him in the same thanksgiving. No words can represent his surprize and vexation, when he received the Archbishop's nar∣rative of the Queen's misconduct: he imagined it at first to be a forged story, yet resolved to make a strict enquiry into it, but with all possible secresy. Com∣municating the case to some of his counsellors, he told them, that he believed it to be a piece of calumny: but as he could not rest till he knew the certainty of the affair, he would have it examined with such pre∣cautions, as might preserve his consort from scandal if she was innocent. He ordered the Keeper of the privy seal to interrogate Lassels and his sister; who both resolutely adhered to what they had said: and Sir Thomas Wriothesly was appointed to examine Man∣nock, and to apprehend Derham, upon pretence of a piracy, with which he had been formerly charged in Ireland. George Mannock owned only some inde∣cent freedoms he had taken in feeling the most private parts of her body, prior to the time of Derham's fa∣miliarity with her: but this last confessed his having
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>lain frequently with her, and named three different women that were, one after another, in bed with her, when he committed the facts.</P>
<P>It was with an inconceivable grief, and such a terri∣ble distraction of mind, as, barring all utterance of speech, forced a vent only in tears, that Henry re∣ceived the report of the examinations. Archbishop Cranmer the Chancellor, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Sussex, and the Bishop of Winchester, being appointed to interrogate the Queen on the subject, she at first denied all: but finding them apprised of all her practices, she confessed the whole to the Arch∣bishop, and signed the confession with her own hand. Eight or nine other witnesses, who had opportunities of knowing her behaviour, agreed in the same tale, with other circumstances shewing Catherine's lascivious∣ness and incontinence. There were strong presumptions that she intended to continue her amours with Derham; having lately taken him into her service, and trained him often into her privy-chamber, under pretence of send∣ing him on errands, and writing letters, in the absence of her secretary. One of the women, who had been privy to their former familiarities, was likewise brought to serve in the Queen's bed-chamber. Thomas Cole∣pepper, a relation of the Queen by her mother, was taken up on violent suspicion, having, whilst the King was in the North, been brought, by the means of Lady Rochford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 431 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>, into her Majesty's chamber at eleven o'clock at night, and staid there till four in the morn∣ing. Upon examination Lady Rochford confessed the crime: and Colepepper and Derham were hanged; but Mannock got off by giving up the best part of his estate.</P>
<P>A. D. 1542.] Further proceedings against the Queen were referred to a parliament;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Is beheaded.</NOTE> which being summoned on November 23, met on Ja∣nuary 16 at Westminster, a bill for attainting Cathe∣rine
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>Howard, late Queen of England, and Jane Lady Rochford, of high treason, were brought into the Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Lords on January 21; but the Chancellor mov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng on the 28th, that they would not proceed too hastily in a matter of such importance, in which no room should be left for suspicion, or future complaint, and purga∣tion; and that it was proper for a committee of both houses to wait upon the Queen, and hear what she could alledge in her own behalf, a deputation of that house was immediately sent to her. She repeated her confession to them: and processes against those already convicted being brought as a further evidence, the bill passed the House of Lords, on February 8, and being agreed to by the Commons, was passed by letters-pa∣tent under the great seal; the parliament having de∣sired the King not to take the trouble of giving the royal assent to the act in his own person.</P>
<P>The old Duchess of Norfolk, Catherine Countess of Bridgewater (the Queen's aunt) who had been only indic∣ted, the Lord William Howard (her uncle) and his wife Margaret, with nine others, who had been convicted at common law for knowing and concealing Catherine's lewdness, were put into the act, and attainted of misprision of treason. A clause in it obliged all persons, "that should know anything of the incontinence of the Queen for the time being, to reveal it with all possible speed to the King's council, under the pains of treason: and if the King, or his successors, should intend to marry any woman, taking her to be a pure maid, if she, not being so, did not declare it to the King, it should be deemed high treason, and all who knew it, and did not reveal it, were made guilty of misprision of treason." All solicitations, by message or words, to engage any one "to corrupt the Queen, or the Prince's wife, were declared high treason in all parties concerned therein."</P>
<P>The Queen was, upon February 12, beheaded within the Tower; and, confessing at her death the looseness of her former life, protested solemnly, that she had
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>not defiled his Majesty's couch since their marriage. The Lady Rochford also suffered decapitation at the fame time; and as she was a woman of dissolute mo∣rals, people began to suspect the justice of Anne Bo∣leyn's fate. It was thought hard to punish the Queen's relations in so severe a manner, for not discovering her former ill conduct: and the King, in a little time, pardoned them all, as well as most of the other con∣cealers of Catherine's incontinence.</P>
<P>In this session, the bishoprics of Chester and of Man were severed from the province of Canterbury, and made subject to the Archbishop of York, for in∣creasing the number of his suffragans. On January 23, during this session, the King assumed the title of <HI>King of Ireland,</HI> his predecessors having only used that of <HI>Lord.</HI> This seems to have been no impolitic step; for whether the Irish Christians had been much weakened before, or thought it not below them to yield obedience, and own a subordination, to the royal dignity, James Earl of Desmond, coming over in the summer to England, made his submission: and his example was followed by the heads of several septs, who were content to take titles of honour after the English fashion.</P>
<P>James V. had endeavoured to excuse his not com∣ing to the interview proposed at York: but his apo∣logies, such as they were, did not abate Henry's re∣sentment. Treaties were carried on for an accommo∣dation: but these proving unsuccessful, the King of England published a declaration of war, revived the old claim of superiority over the crown of Scotland, and required James to do him homage. Some hosti∣lities ensued on both sides: the bad success of an army, sent to ravage the west marches of England, at Sol∣way-mass, is thought to have contributed to the death of James, who had been for sometime but in an indif∣ferent state of health. He died in his palace on
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>December 13, leaving only a daughter, scarce a week old, to inherit his crown and dominions.</P>
<P>Henry,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Henry's views to unite Scot∣land with England.</NOTE> on the news of his nephew's death, send<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, on December 26, for the Earls of Cassels and Glencarne, the Lords Maxwell, Sommervilles, Oliphant, Grey, and several other Scotch gentlemen, who had been taken at Solway-mass, and then resided at Lon∣don, to court, acquainted them with his inclination, to prevent all future quarrels between the two nations, and to unite the crowns by marriage between his son Prince Edward, and Mary their infant Sovereign. The prisoners seemed all to like a proposal, that promi∣sed so much good to both countries: and some of them entered very cordially into his measures; promising upon oath, as well to make up the match, as to bring the young Queen immediately into England, and get the government of the realm, with some of the strongest forts, committed to his Majesty. They were hereupon released, though under an obligation of returning again to prison, if they did not accomplish their engagements by a certain day.</P>
<P>A. D. 1543.] Henry had this marriage so much at heart, that, knowing there was a strong party against it in Scotland, which might create insupportable diffi∣culties, when the articles of it came to be adjusted, he resolved to be provided for carrying his point by force, in case he did not succeed by the way of treaty. With this view, when the parliament of England, which had been prorogued from Nov. 3, to January 22, met on the last of these days, he represented to the two houses, his claim on the crown of Scotland, the late hostilities of the Scots, the expences he had been at in the war, the success of his arms, the favourable opportunity offered of reducing that country to the obe∣dience of England, and the necessity of a supply. The Commons, ever liberal of the subjects money after a
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>victory, readily granted him a large subsidy to be paid for three years together: and one of six shillings in the pound was likewise granted, by the convocation of both provinces. The King was now in the eve of a war, if not with Scotland, at least with France, in consequence of a league actually negotiating with the Emperor for that purpose: and thought it necessary to provide for the quiet of his subjects, "by relaxing somewhat of the severity of the statute of the six ar∣ticles, exempting the laity from death, and making that which was capital for the clergy in the first, to be so only in the third offence." This was done by an act for the advancement of true religion, and abolishing of the contrary; which, "forbidding all persons to preach without licence, and interdicting all disputes, and the use of Tindal's Bible, allowed all of a degree not lower than a yeoman, to have the scriptures truly translated, and every body to read the King's injunc∣tions, <HI>The erudition of a Christian man,</HI> the psalter, pri∣mer, and other books, published by his authority for the instruction of his people." For the better exe∣cution of a late statute, making the King's procla∣mation equally obligatory with acts of parliament, offences against it were subjected to the cognisance of nine of the privy council; the greater number, re∣quired before, having caused great delays in bringing offenders to a trial.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">The King marries Ca∣therine Parr.</NOTE> The act for attainting Catherine Howard had created a difficulty with regard to the King's marriage; no maiden cared to run the hazard of her life, by exposing her virginity to be tried by his suspicions. He was thus under a necessity of matching with a widow: and Catherine Parr, re∣lict of John Nevil Lord Latimer, being a Lady highly esteemed for her prudence, virtue, and merit, he married her, and caused her to be proclaimed Queen, on July 12.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
<P>She favoured the reformation in her heart:<NOTE PLACE="inter">Scheme against Cranmer.</NOTE> but she knew how dangerous it was to con∣tradict the King in religious matters; and therefore she would not venture to interpose in behalf of three Protestants, who, soon after her nuptials, were, at the solicitation of Gardiner Bishop of Win∣chester, burned at Windsor. That prelate, and the other enemies of the reformation, not contented with the destruction of those and some others, eagerly as∣pired at the ruin of Archbishop Cranmer, whom they considered as the head and protector of all the inno∣vators in religion; and on the supposition, that the King would bear no contradiction in articles of faith, they ventured to insinuate to his Majesty, that heresy would never be wedded out of the land, while its pa∣tron was suffered to flourish. Henry at first made no answer to these suggestions, because he guessed their aim, and imagined his silence would discourage them from renewing their attempts: but Gardiner, and the Duke of Norfolk, with other partizans of popery, re∣peated the same strain so often, that his curiosity was interested. He seemed to listen with pleasure to their remonstrances, and even received some articles of ac∣cusation against the primate, subscribed with the names of his accusers; for the Duke and the Bishop, being unwilling to appear as parties in the affair, had pre∣vailed upon the canons of Canterbury, and some jus∣tices of the peace in Kent, to prefer those articles against Cranmer. Henry, thus informed, took an opportunity, while he diverted himself on the Thames, to stop at Lambeth; and the Archbishop coming down to receive his Majesty, was ordered to come into the barge, where the King conversed with him in private. He expressed his uneasiness at the growth of heresy, which he said he was resolved to extirpate, by pu∣nishing its favourers and protectors with the utmost rigour of the law. Cranmer applauded his resolution; but intreated him, in the name of God, to examine
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>well what was branded with the name of heresy, lest, in punishing supposed heretics, he should wreak his vengeance on the faithful servants of the Almighty. Then the King told him, that he was supposed to be the chief protector of the heretics, and put into his hands the articles of accusation; which the Archbishop having perused with great composure, he fell upon his knees, and desired he might be brought to trial. He frankly owned, that, with respect to the statute of the six articles, which he had so strenuously opposed, his sentiments still remained unaltered, though he had never spoke nor acted against it in any shape, since it acquired the force of a law. When the King asked him, if he was really married? he answered in the affirmative: but de∣clared, that, as soon as the act of the six articles had passed through both houses, he sent his wife to Germany. Henry was so struck with the candour and ingenuity of the Primate, that he assured him of his protection; made him acquainted with the scheme that was formed for his destruction; disclosed to him the names of his accusers; and commanded him to prosecute them for defamation. Cranmer begged to be excused; but the King insisted upon his proceeding, and desired him to nominate the judges. The Archbishop, however, pro∣ceeded so coldly in the prosecution, that Henry, seeing it was against his inclination, allowed him to drop it, though he could not help admiring his generosity. Such was the simplicity of Cranmer's heart, that he could not distinguish his own enemies; and such his benevolence, that he could not with-hold his assistance from those whom he knew to be his adversaries. One day he went to court to solicit in favour of a person who had craved his interest. Henry asked him, if he thought that person was his friend? and he replying in the affirmative, "No (said the King) he is your inve∣terate foe, and I order you to call him knave when you see him." Cranmer begged he might be excused from using such expressions, as they did not become the mouth
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>of a Bishop. Henry said he would be obeyed; but Cranmer found means to avoid the meeting; and the King continued to admire and love him for his meek∣ness and benevolence.</P>
<P>A war having broke out last year between the Em∣peror and France, the former endeavoured by all means to enter into a league with England: and the articles being settled on February 11, it was ratified in less than three months after; and Sir John Wallop was, on July 7, sent over, with Sir Thomas Seymour, and 6000 men, to join the Imperial army in Flanders.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the parliament of Scotland meet∣ing on March 12, declared next day the Earl of Ar∣ran the second person in the realm, and next in succes∣sion to the crown, in case of the Queen's decease with∣out issue. Instructions were likewise given to Sir James Lermont, Sir W. Hamilton, and H. Balneves, secretary of state, appointed ambassadors, for treating a peace with England, and the marriage of the Queen with Prince Edward. These restrained them from consenting, either to her removal into England before she was of age to be married, or to the surrender of any forts for security of her being delivered afterwards. There was however a strong party determined to op∣pose the marriage; the Queen-mother, the Cardinal, all the clergy, and the French faction among the no∣bility, being embarked in it. Such was the situation of affairs when Sir Ralph Sadler arrived at Edinburgh, the day after the recess of parliament.</P>
<P>However, the opposition that was made did not pre∣vent the treaties being concluded, on July 1, at Green∣wich. That of peace was made for the lives of both Princes, and for a year after the decease of either. That for the marriage provided, that the Queen should, at the consummation of the marriage, have a jointure of 2000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year settled on her during Henry's life, to be increased to 4000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> after his decease; that when she was ten years of age complete, the contract of
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>marriage being made by the proxies of the parties, she should be sent into England; that hostages should be delivered to Henry's commissioners, for the per∣formance of the articles relating to the marriage; that the kingdom of Scotland should still retain its name, laws, and liberties; and if, after the Queen's going to England, Prince Edward should die without issue by her, she should have free liberty of returning to Scotland unmarried, and without any impediment. A convention of the estates was called at Edinburgh, and, on August 25, the Governor swore, in their name, to the observance thereof. Cardinal Beton, and the rest of the French party, seemed to assent to it; but it was only to cover their designs: for, in the month of October, having received succours from France, they openly shewed their intentions to the contrary.</P>
<P>The Cardinal soon persuaded the Governor, James Hamilton Earl of Arran, who was of a fickle disposi∣tion, to change sides, upon the French ambassador's assurances of their being assisted by 6000 men in his master's pay, from Denmark, with money to main∣tain 10,000 Scotch in the field, and with all the force by sea and land that they should desire. The late trea∣ties of peace and marriage with England were annulled, as being expired, and not to be kept on the part of Scotland, on prerence of their being broke by the de∣taining of Scotch ships, and their not being ratified by Henry. New alliances were made with France for the invasion of England, whenever the French realm should be attacked by Henry.</P>
<P>1544.] These proceedings put the two nations into the same state of war they were in before the treaties: and Henry detesting the Governor's falsehood, knowing the engagements which the Cardinal, and the prevailing party in the kingdom, had entered into with France, to be utterly incompatible with such terms of peace as were necessary for the security of his realm, and see∣ing
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>that the gentle ways of treaty, which, like a polite courtier, he had at first taken to procure the marriage, and establish a perpetual amity, had not succeeded, he resolved to proceed in a different manner, and make them feel the effects of his vengeance.</P>
<P>To provide for a Scotch as well as French war, the King obtained from the parliament, which met on January 14, a discharge of all the sums he had bor∣rowed two years before upon loan from individuals. As he proposed to go abroad in person, at the head of his army, it was proper to settle the suc∣cession of the crown so,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The succession settled anew.</NOTE> as not to leave it doubtful in case of any accident: and this was done in such a manner, as to gratify the Em∣peror, with whom he was now in league, and who in∣terested himself much for the Princess Mary. An act passed for settling it on Prince Edward, and the Prin∣cess Mary and Elizabeth, and their issue, in their re∣spective orders, according to the usual course of suc∣cession; the two last being subjected to such condi∣tions as the King, by letters-patent, or his last will, signed by his hand, should appoint. Several persons had been burnt the last year for heresy; and the King, seeming to relent a little, put a stop, for a while, to such persecutions, as he imagined they would throw a blot upon his reign<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Among these was Adam Darnlip, who, having been laid hold of before, made his escape to the West of England, where he taught a school. When he was retaken, he was by Bishop Gardiner com∣mitted to the Marshalsea, and afterwards carried to execution. One Henry was burned at Colchester; and another person called Kirby suffered at Ipswich.</NOTE>: and it was moreover thought proper to prevent their being revived, lest any distur∣bance should happen in the realm during his absence. Thus an act passed to qualify that of the six articles, by providing, "that none should be indicted for any offence against it, but upon a presentment by the oaths of twelve persons, nor imprisoned till so indicted; that
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>all presentments should be made within a year after the offences committed; that no preacher should be prose∣cuted for words, unless complained of within forty days after his sermon, and the parties indicted were allowed the challenges usual in any other case of fe∣lony." These clauses were added, to discourage and prevent such accusations as had been lately brought against Cranmer, and others, by the artifices of Gar∣diner, who had a slur thrown upon him by the execu∣tion of German Gardiner his secretary, on March 7, for denying the King's supremacy.</P>
<P>Among other statutes enacted in this parliament, there was one for empowering the King to nominate commissioners for revising the ecclesiastical constitu∣tions: and, in this session, the titles of King of Eng∣land, France, and Ireland, defender of the faith, and supreme head of the Anglicane church, were insepa∣rably annexed to the English crown.</P>
<P>Henry's eagerness for his French expedition did not make him forget his care of religion. With a view of reforming the publick offices, he had caused a form of procession, a litany, collects, psalms, and a paraphrase on the Lord's prayer, all in the English tongue, to be published, with a preface, exhorting all persons to pray in their mother language. This composition had no∣thing exceptionable in it, except some invocations to saints to pray for the congregation, which did not re∣concile it to the Roman Catholics so far as to prevent their being shocked at a new petition inserted therein, for delivery "from the tyranny of the Bishop of Rome, and all his detestable enormities."</P>
<P>The King, leaving the Queen Regent, sailed on July 11 for Calais; his forces having landed there some time before, and part of them, under the D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of Norfolk, having marched to Monstreuil. The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of Suffolk having invested Boulogne on July 19, the lower town was taken two days after. The King ar∣riving on the 26th in the camp with the rest of his
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>forces, which now amounted to 30,000 men, a battery was erected, on August 3, against the higher town: but, for want of powder, the siege went on so slowly, that the place did not surrender till the 14th of Sep∣tember. The Emperor's concluding a treaty of peace with France, about this time, saved Monstreuil; for the Dauphin advancing with a great army, and the Imperial Generals retiring with their forces, the Duke of Norfolk raised the siege, and joined the main army at Boulogne: where Henry having spent some time in treating about a peace, without any effect, sailed thence, on September 30, for England.</P>
<P>A. D. 1545.] Having been at a great expence in his French expedition, and the keeping of Boulogne being likely to cost him a great deal more, to provide for it, Henry had recourse to the extraordinary way of benevo∣lence, which he found some difficulty in levying<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a general clamour against this method of raising money, and one Read, an Alderman of London, being very refrac∣tory, was impressed to serve as a soldier on the northern marches.</NOTE>. The success which the English had lately met with in their incursions into Scotland, encouraged them to make another in February; but being defeated on the 17th of this month, by the Earl of Angus, were forced to retreat. The Scots assembled an army of 15,000 men, to invade England; but contented themselves with ad∣vancing to the borders, and then retired, without ef∣fecting their purpose. At the same time the French made several descents and attempts on the coast of England, with very little success; for the English sleet being reinforced, so as to venture an engagement in the open sea, they returned to Havre.</P>
<P>To supply the King's expences in these wars, a par∣liament was summoned. It met on November 23, and granted him two whole fifteenths and tenths, be∣sides an usual subsidy, to be paid for two years toge∣ther; another of six shillings in the pound, payable in
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>two years, being granted at the same time by the clergy.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Colleges, hos∣pitals, &amp;c. suppressed.</NOTE> It was still a larger supply, which he got by the parliament's giving him the disposal of all chapels, colleges, chantries, hospitals, and fraternities, with their lands and possessions throughout the kingdom. Twenty-four of these had already surrendered to the King; the lands of others had either been seized by the founders, or leased out for long terms: but all being now vested in the crown, the seizures and leases were annulled, and the resignations confirmed. Hence followed a general destruction of those foundations, most of which had been instituted to say masses in for the souls of their benefactors: but the King took care to confirm the rights of the universities. Any two churches lying within a mile of one another, and either of them not exceeding 6 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in the King's book, were allowed to be united, and incorporated together by the ordinary, with the consent of the patron, incumbent, and pa∣rishioners: and doctors of the civil law, though lay∣men and married, were allowed to exercise ecclesiasti∣cal jurisdiction.</P>
<P>A. D. 1546.] A peace having been concluded with France at Campes between Ardres and Guisnes, it was proclaimed at London on June 13, though it was not ratified by the King of France till the 1st of Au∣gust. It was agreed, that the Scotch should be com∣prehended in this treaty, so as the King of England should make no war upon them, unless some new oc∣casion were given.</P>
<P>One of the King's motives for the late war with France, was his resentment at Francis's having broke his promise of casting off the Pope's supremacy, and promoting a reformation in his dominions: and some writers relate, that, at the peace of Campes, a secret engagement was made between them, for abolishing the mass in both their realms. It is added, that the King had ordered Cranmer to draw up a communion-office
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>in place of it, to be sent to Francis, for his con∣sideration: but, though Henry might order such a form to be drawn for the use of his own realm, the King of France seems to have been, at that time, in no dispo∣sition for making such an alteration in the French di∣vine offices: at least his ambassadors, in their harangue, on July 29, to the council of Trent, expressly dis∣claimed all designs of that nature, professed his deter∣mined adherence to the Pope, and the church of Rome, and represented it as a great merit in the King of France, that, though he had often been solicited by large offers to do otherwise, and follow Henry's ex∣ample, yet nothing could ever shake him in his reso∣lution.</P>
<P>That council having been opened on December 13, 1545,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings in the council of Trent.</NOTE> held its second session in the be∣ginning of this year, on January 7, when thirty-two Bishops were present, most of them Italians. As the Cardinals de Monte, Cervino, and Pole, the Pope's Legates, who presided in it, had not as yet received full instructions of what they were to treat of, or how they were to proceed, nothing was done in it, besides fixing the style it was to assume, viz. the holy, oecumenical, and general coun∣cil of Trent: the additional words, representing the church universal, proposed by the French Bishops, be∣ing rejected. Another motion for delivering their opi∣nions, or voting by nations, had the same fate; the number of Italian Bishops being greater than those of France, Spain, and Germany, put together. The next session was spent in reading and professing their belief of the Nicene creed: but in the fourth, on A∣pril 8, they agreed in a decree, that, "the council received, with equal respect, all the books of the Old and New Testament, and traditions concerning faith and manners, as derived from the mouth of Jesus Christ, dictated by the Holy Spirit, and preserved in the Catho∣lic church." This was followed by a catalogue of the
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>sacred books (among which were the apocryphal, that had never been received by the Jewish church) and an anathema "against all who did not either receive these books entire for sacred and canonical, so as they are read in the Catholic church, and contained in the <HI>vulgat</HI> Latin, or did knowingly and deliberately despise traditions." This was done, without specifying the particular traditions thus equalized with the scriptures, and without laying down any rules to shew, either what traditions ought to be received on that foot, or why the order of Deaconesses, which undoubtedly was of apostolical institution, or the cup in the eucharist, in∣stituted by our Saviour himself, and supported by the universal, uniform, and constant practice of the church, for 1400 years, were not admitted among such tradi∣tions. No version can, in the nature of things, be of equal authority with the text; yet they declared, "the <HI>vulgat</HI> Latin translation of the scriptures to be divine and authentic, though they knew it to differ in many places from the original text; and to abound with such a multitude of errors, that it was a work of many years to correct them, and, after establishing it with all these errors, they actually agreed to refer the correc∣tion of it to six divines, who were to publish it before the end of the council. They next "condemned all interpretations of scripture contrary to the sense of the church, and the unanimous consent of the fathers;" which, as the fathers are seldom unanimous in their explaining of any text, was arrogating the exposition of scripture to their own church, exclusive of the rest, and most numerous part, of christendom. The session concluded with "a prohibition of printing, selling, or keeping any anonymous books, not approved by authority," under pain of excommunication; a decree daily broke, and never observed in any country, but where the inquisition is established. There were not above five Cardinals, and forty-eight Bishops, some
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>of them only titular, present, when points of such consequence were determined.</P>
<P>The Lutheran divines had, in a late conference with the Roman Catholics, at Ratisbon, explained their sentiments with regard to original sin, and some other points, in such a manner, that both sides had agreed on the subject: but the members of the council think∣ing it below them to agree with the former in any thing, looked out for pretences to multiply disputes. Thus catching hold of some unguarded expressions of Luther, which had been explained in a good sense, they condemn∣ed them in five canons, about original sin, which they passed in their fifth session, on June 17, without pub∣lishing, as usual, any exposition of their own doctrine, upon the subject. The doctrines about justification, free-will, grace, and predestination, took up seven months, till January 13, when decrees were made on those subjects, couched in terms too unintelligible for the instruction of the generality of Christians, and founded, in several points, upon scholastic opinions and the philosophy of Aristotle; so that, if this Heathen had not furnished them with the distinction of final, efficient, meritorious, instrumental, and formal causes, some articles of faith would have been wanting. The word <HI>sacrament</HI> had been formerly used, sometimes in a very loose sense, and applied to all rites designed for the honour of God. It was not till the twelfth cen∣tury (a very late date for an apostolical tradition) that Lombard, the father of the schoolmen, delivered his opinion, that they were seven in number. The coun∣cil however, in this next session, on March 3 (when their decrees on the sacraments in general, and on baptism and confirmation in particular, were passed, unattended by any exposition of their own doctrine) thought fit, without determining what was the pro∣per essence and true notion of a sacrament, to pro∣nounce an anathema against all, "that either held there were more or fewer sacraments than seven pro∣perly
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>so called, or that said they were not all instituted by Jesus Christ;" though there is not, with regard to some of them, the least pretence to such an immediate institution, as the words seem to imply. "All who held that none of them were more worthy than another in any respect, or that they were not necessary to salva∣tion" (though they were not so to all persons, because, in their notions, there was a high perfection in vows of virginity, and matrimony was incompatible with orders) or "that baptism, orders, and confirmation did not imprint in the soul an indelible spiritual charac∣ter" (though such an indelible quality impressed on the soul is utterly incomprehensible) or "that the mi∣nister's intention (either actual or virtual) to do what the church does, is not necessary in the administration of the sacraments," were subjected to the like ana∣themas. Eight days after these decrees, on March 11, the council was, in consequence of a papal bull, transferred to Bologna in Italy; on the report of a plague in Tirol, and the unverified pretence of a con∣tagious sickness at Trent, which either ceased or was never heard of, after the council was removed.</P>
<P>The proceedings of this council seemed very well to justify the objections which the Lutheran Princes and states had made, to excuse their not owning it as a free council, and their not submitting to its decrees. They had desired a free one to be held somewhere in Ger∣many: but it could not be pretended, that Trent was in that country, on any other account, than because its Bishop was a Prince of the empire; nor was it a safe place for them to come to, since they would be there as much in the Pope's power, as if they had been in Italy. They could not think a council free, if the Pope, who was a party in the case, or his Legates, should preside in it, and consequently be masters of all debates, proposing, interrupting, suspending them, and starting new subjects at their pleasure. These were practices which the court of Rome would un∣doubtedly
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>use, to prevent decisions disagreeable to its maxims or interests; and would succeed in them the easier, because all Bishops were pre-engaged to the Pope, by oaths of obedience they had taken to him, and for the support of the Papacy. It was for this reason they insisted, that, before a council was called, the forms and methods of its proceedings, its constitution and authority, should be settled; and that the scriptures, with the sense of the primitive fathers and councils in the first six centuries, should be made the rule of its decisions, without any regard to the quirks, subtilties, distinctions, or opinions of the schoolmen. How just their apprehensions were, appeared in all the transactions of the council, which could not take a step till leave was granted by the Pope, nor debate any point, but what his Legates thought fit to propose. These Pre∣lates assumed an authority which destroyed its freedom, putting off debates whenever they pleased, excluding Vergerio, Bishop of Capo d'Istria, from his seat there, brow-beating and reprimanding the learned and pious Bishops of Fiesoli and Chioggia (for speaking their minds in behalf of the reformation of some abuses) in such a manner, as to oblige them at last to retire; and telling the Spanish Bishops, who pressed for residence being declared <HI>jure divino,</HI> with an imperious air, "It was the Pope's pleasure they should speak no more on the subject that session." This prohibition arose from an apprehension, that if it was once determined, that God had enjoined Bishops to watch incessantly over their flocks, it would be inferred thence, that he had given them all the powers necessary for the discharge of their duty.</P>
<P>The Emperor was very urgent, that the council would proceed upon matters of reformation, before they meddled with doctrines; the Pope was for beginning with these last, and deferring the other perhaps for ever. It was necessary, for the execution of their schemes in Germany, to make a shew of doing some∣thing
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>towards a reformation of abuses; and, a com∣promise being made for proceeding on both together, the Pope sent instructions to his Legates, to proceed with expedition in the doctrines, and with all the slow∣ness, they could contrive, in the points of reformation. His orders were executed; passages were extracted from the Augsburg confession, and the works of Luther and Zuinglius, with no other view than to cen∣sure them, if they were capable of an ill sense, though they had at the same time a good one, in which they might have been taken. It was a received principle among the Prelates assembled at Trent, that it was odious and scandalous for them to agree with Luther in any thing: hence arose so many pretences for making real errors of such as were only nominal, as depending purely on the sense of expressions, and so many unnecessary decisions in trifles and verbal dis∣putes. The Pope had given directions, that, in points contested among the Roman Catholics, care should be taken to avoid deciding particularly to the prejudice of one of the parties, for fear of occasioning schisms, or raising disputes, which might hinder their acting in concert against the Lutherans. Hence arose such an affected obscurity in some decrecs, that the learned Pybrac says, in a letter to the Chancellor de L'Hopital, that whereas other men spoke to be under∣stood, it seemed to be the design of this council to ex∣press themselves so, as not to be understood. As most of the decrees were founded on scholastic notions, it was impossible in certain cases to avoid disputes be∣tween the Thomists and the Scotists; though several new articles of faith were prevented by the violent at∣tachment which the Dominicans and Franciscans had for their contradictory opinions. When, in order to condemn Luther, it was necessary to touch on any of these controverted doctrines, the decrees were framed so, as to create a union in words, which each man in∣terpreted his own way, whilst their sentiments were
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>as widely different as ever. Hence it came, that in less than two years Soto and Vega, both eminent divines, who had a great share in all debates of the council, publishing comments upon its decrees in the fifth session, maintained their opposite opinions to be the true sense of the council: and the former of these having published a book, <HI>De Natura et Gratia,</HI> was opposed by Catharin, in the article of certainty of grace; each pretending, that the council had decided in his favour, though their opinions were contradictory. Both parties appealed to the Bishops who had sat in the council; but these were divided in their sentiments, which of them were in the right, nor could even the Presidents take upon them to determine the true sense of the decree in question; which not having been un∣derstood by the persons, that at that time compiled it, can hardly now be supposed more intelligible. As to the points of reformation, the council avoided touch∣ing on the hundred grievances for which the Germans demanded redress; and, most of these arising from the court of Rome, the Pope would not suffer the council to meddle with them; but issuing a bull, reserved the reformation of his own court and ministers to himself. He took the same method with regard to the union of benefices, whether perpetual or for life only, made within the last forty years, to pluralities and residences; and his Legates, following his instructions, with the Bishops under their direction, exerted all their arts and influence to prevent a serious and solid reformation; and, when it could be done in no other way, got the matters in debate still referred to the Pope, that nothing might be reformed to the prejudice of the Papal inte∣rest and pretensions. Hence arose those clauses, <HI>salva semper in omnibus autoritate apostolica,</HI> and, "if the a∣postolical see shall not judge otherwise;" which may be seen in several of the decrees of reformation. Potent bodies, and rich Cardinals, were concerned in many of the most mischievous corruptions; and those were
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>not to be disobliged: nor could any endeavours pre∣vail, for suppressing or recalling the exorbitant exemp∣tions or privileges of the mendicant orders, though they rendered a Bishop's residence in a manner useless, and subverted all order and discipline. Hence it came, that no reformation was made, but what was either trifling in itself, or likely to prove useless, by being subject to a papal dispensation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See more of this council in the first volume of this work, p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nothing was proposed (as the Emperor had en∣gaged) in this council, relating to the King of Eng∣land, who dictated at home in religious and civil mat∣ters, and his subjects durst not avow any deviation from his sentiments. He had for ten years been trou∣bled with ulcers in his legs, the pain of which, together with his corpulence and other bodily infirmities, ren∣dered him so peevish and fretful, that scarce any per∣son approached him without fear and trembling. He was impatient of contradiction in every thing, and espe∣cially in matters of religion; but by this time his tem∣per was so irritated, that those, who presumed to dif∣fer from him in opinion, could expect no mercy. Nicholas Shaxton<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See pages 427 and 428 of the preceding volume, and pages 3 and 13 of this.</NOTE>, who had resigned the bishopric of Salisbury, and still remained in prison for having re∣fused to conform to the statute of the six articles, being now accused of denying the real presence in the sacra∣ment of the altar<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See page 450 of the former volume.</NOTE>, the King ordered that he should be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law; and he was condemned to the stake: but he saved his life by signing a recantation, and in the sequel became a most rigid persecutor of the Protestants.</P>
<P>A young lady named Anne, daughter of Sir Wil∣liam Ascough,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Anne Ascough burned.</NOTE> of North Kelsey in Lin∣colnshire, being a woman of uncom∣mon
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>talents, was well known and esteemed by several persons at court. She was convicted of denying the real presence in the sacrament, and chose rather to suf∣fer death than to purchase pardon by abjuring her prin∣ciples. Being known to be favoured by some ladies of high rank, and suspected of maintaining a religious correspondence with the Queen, Sir Thomas Wriothe∣sley, Lord Chancellor, hoping that she would disco∣ver something that might furnish matter of impeach∣ment against her Majesty, the Earl of Hertford, or his Countess, who favoured the reformation, caused Anne to be put to the rack; and he is even said to have assisted manually in augmenting the torture, which, though administered with uncommon violence, she en∣dured with the most amazing fortitude. Her bones were dislocated in such a manner, that she was obliged to be carried in a chair to the stake in Smithfield, where she (being then about 25 years of age) suffered with Nicholas Belevian, a priest of Shropshire, John Lassels, gentleman of the houshold to the King, and John Adams, a poor taylor of London, all condemn∣ed on the same account; and Shaxton attended them to the place, where he preached a sermon, reproach∣ing them, in the harshest terms, as obstinate and in∣corrigible heretics.</P>
<P>The enemies of the reformation, perceiving the King so furiously incensed against the Sa∣cramentarians,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Another at∣tempt against Cranmer.</NOTE> or those who did not be∣lieve in transubstantiation, made another effort to destroy Cranmer. They renewed their complaints against him, as the protector of that sect; and told Henry, that were the Archbishop once committed to the Tower, such proofs would appear against him, as would astonish his Majesty. The King loved Cranmer with an affection which seemed to contradict every other part of his character; and he now resented the presumption of those who attempted to ruin a man, in whose favour he had so often inter∣posed.
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>Nevertheless he dissembled his sentiments, re∣ceived the articles of his accusation, and permitted that he should next day be examined in council. In the evening, however, he sent privately for Cranmer, told him what had passed, and desired to know in what man∣ner he proposed to defend himself. The Archbishop thanked the King for his great goodness in making him previously acquainted with the designs of his adver∣saries, and humbly intreated his Majesty to appoint such judges for his trial, as should understand the sub∣ject on which he was to be questioned. Henry, smiling at the Primate's simplicity, told him he was a fool to make so light of his own safety; that, if he was once in prison, his enemies would find abundance of false witnesses to ruin him; and that, since he would not take care of himself, he (the King) would look after his affairs. He directed him to appear before the council when summoned, and plead his privilege as Privy Counsellor, that his accusers might be brought before his face; that in case they should insist upon his being sent to the Tower, he should appeal personally to the King, and produce his Majesty's seal-ring, which he then took from his finger, and delivered to Cranmer. Next morning, the Archbishop was cited to appear before the council, and going to the place where they sat, was kept waiting in a lobby among servants, to the astonishment of all the spectators, until Dr. Butts, the King's physician, having seen him by accident, communicated this circumstance to Henry, who forth∣with sent an order that he should be admitted. When the Primate appeared before the board, they acquaint∣ed him that they had received divers informations, af∣firming that all the heresies in England sprang from him and his chaplains. Cranmer, in his answer, conform∣ed to the King's direction; and perceiving them bent upon committing him to the Tower, told them he was sorry to be so used by those with whom he had sat so long at the same board. At the same time he pre∣sented
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>the ring; at the sight of which the counsellors were astonished and confounded, and repaired in a body to the King, who chid them severely for having treat∣ed the Archbishop of Canterbury in so unworthy a manner. He told them, he thought he had a wiser council than now he found they were. He laid his hand upon his breast, and declared, by the faith he owed to God, that he believed the Archbishop was the most faithful of all his subjects. The Duke of Nor∣folk endeavoured to excuse their conduct, by saying, that all they intended was a trial, by which the Arch∣bishop's innocence would have been vindicated so, as to be free from all future aspersion. Henry replied, with a frown, he would not suffer persons, who were so dear to him, to be handled in that fashion; and said that he knew their factions and malice, and that he was resolved to extinguish the one, and punish the other without mercy. In the mean time he commanded them to be reconciled to the Primate; and the cere∣mony was performed in his presence.</P>
<P>This check did not so much discourage the Popish party, but that they attempted another stroke of still greater importance.<NOTE PLACE="inter">A design against the Queen.</NOTE> Queen Catherine was a favourer of the reforma∣tion, and frequently had sermons preach∣ed in her apartments by clergymen of that persuasion. Her husband was apprised of these particulars, and connived at them. He even condescended to allow her to dispute on points of religion, though he hated that women should argue on these topics: and sometimes her zeal exceeded her discretion. One evening she proceeded so far, that he was exasperated at her for∣wardness: perhaps his vanity was mortified by her getting the better of him in the way of argument. When she quitted the apartment, the King complained of her presumption to Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester; who fed his resentment with malicious insinuations, and, associating the Chancellor in his design, represent∣ed
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>the Queen, and her principal ladies, as heretics who patronized the innovators, and had corresponded with Anne Ascough. They even affirmed, that they were traitors as well as heretics; and inflamed his Majesty's passion in such an artful manner, that he subscribed certain articles against the Queen, intended as the foundation of an impeachment. The Chancellor hap∣pening to drop the paper, it was found by a person who delivered it to Catherine. She no sooner saw the King's subscription, than she concluded herself ruined, and was overwhelmed with fear and consternation. The agitation of her mind produced violent fits, of which Henry being informed, he visited her in her chamber, and spoke to her with such expressions of tenderness, as very much contributed to her recovery. Next night she waited upon the King in his apartment; and he turning the conversation upon religious disputes, she said, that, conscious of the weakness of her sex, she, as in duty bound, would submit, in these and all other points, to his superior judgment. Henry, still piqued at her former opposition, replied, "Not so, by St. Mary! you are become a Doctor, Kate, to instruct, not to be instructed." She then very artfully assured him, that she should never have presumed to argue with him on any subject, except to alleviate the pain of his infirmities, or with a view to profit by his supe∣rior learning. Hearing this declaration, "Is it even so, sweetheart (said he) then we are perfect friends a∣gain." At parting, he embraced her with much cor∣diality, assuring her, she might depend upon his af∣fection. On the day following, while he walked with her in the garden, the Chancellor appeared with the guard assembled, to conduct her, and several other ladies, to the Tower. The King then, stepping aside with him, was heard to call him knave, fool, beast, and ordered him to quit his presence. The Queen, ignorant of his business, interceded in his favour; and Henry exclaimed, "Poor soul, thou little knowest
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>how ill he deserves thy good offices!" The King was totally alienated from the Bishop of Winchester by his conduct on this occasion. He expelled him from the council; and though that Prelate evaded further dis∣grace and punishment by the most abject submission, he could never retrieve any share of his Sovereign's favour. However liable Henry was to be wrought up to a fury by artful suggestions, to the prejudice of any person, he never liked the accusers. When after the death of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, which happened on August 24, the preceding year, his Ma∣jesty came first to the council chamber, he appeared very melancholy; and being asked the reason, said, "It was the seeing a vacancy, where the Duke of Suffolk used to sit in council; whom he could not but lament, since, when he was offended with any body, the Duke always laboured to mitigate his dis∣pleasure, and never spoke ill of any person; which (looking upon the Lords of the council, one after another) none of them could say for himself."</P>
<P>The Duke of Norfolk had certainly a great hand, if not in the attempt against the Queen, at least in the design formed against Cranmer. Whether the part he acted in that affair contributed to it, or no, he fell soon after into disgrace, and was sent (as his son Henry Earl of Surry was also) on December 12, to the Tower of London. The Earl had been chagrined at being recalled from the government of the Boulonnois, and at the Earl of Hertford's being sent to command the forces in that country: this had provoked him to drop some threatening expressions against the counsellors, as well as a dislike at the King. The Duke, who, by some unhappy defect in his moral qualities, had quar∣relled with two of his nieces, when Queens of England, and in the height of their power, had now a quarrel upon his hands with his own wife, and, by an effect of his own or her pride, his licentiousness, or her jea∣lousy, they had been parted upwards of four years, and
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>expressed their rancour against one another so openly, as to give great scandal on several occasions. She had long ago, in a fit of anger, surmised two articles against him; and she now averred them, charging others also his confidents. One Mrs. Holland, supposed to be one of his mistresses, discovered all she knew of the Duke, though it seems only to have been some com∣plaints of his, that he was not beloved by the King, who thought him too popular, nor by his counsellors, who, being men of low birth, hated him for his supe∣rior quality. Some points of an higher nature were charged upon him, by Sir Richard Southwell, a mem∣ber of the Privy Council; but he denied them, and offered to maintain his innocence by a duel.</P>
<P>A. D. 1547.] The Earl of Surry was convicted of treason on January 13, and on the 19th of that month was beheaded on Tower-hill. The Duke acknowledg∣ing himself to have been guilty of high treason, and confessing he deserved to be attainted for it, humbly sued for the King's mercy and compassion; which it is questioned whether he would have obtained, had the King lived.</P>
<P>The King had for some time felt himself drawing gradually to his end, his dropsy growing daily worse: and having taken care, on December 11, to establish the noble foundation of Trinity college in Cambridge, made his will on the 30th of that month, "leaving the crown to his son Edward, and his daughters Mary and Elizabeth, and their issue in their respective orders; in default of whom to the heirs of his nieces Frances and Eleanor daughters of his sister Mary late Queen of France, by Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk, her second husband, and after them to the next lawful heir: so that the children of his eldest sister Margaret, Queen of Scotland, were excluded from their rank in the succession. he willed that his own daughters should forfeit their right of succession, should they marry without the consent of the Privy Council. In the mean time, to each of them he left ten thousand
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>pounds, by way of dower, and three thousand for their subsistence, until they should be married. The Queen was intitled to three thousand pounds in plate, and one thousand in money, over and above her join∣ture. He left six hundred pounds a-year in land, to the Dean and Chapter of Windsor, for the maintenance of thirteen poor knights, and other pious uses. His executors were directed to pay his debts, repair any injuries he might have unknowingly committed, and confirm all his grants and promises not perfected at the time of his decease. Legacies were left to each of the executors, and many of his faithful servants. On the third day of January he passed a grant of St. Bartholomew's hospital, with the scite of the Francis∣can or Grey Friers church, now called Christ-church, and five hundred marks a year, to the city of London. Though Henry believed his malady incurable, per∣haps he did not think death so very near; and no per∣son would venture to tell him his situation, until Sir Anthony Denny, out of Christian compassion, ex∣horted him to take care of his soul, as he, in all pro∣bability, had not many hours of life to enjoy. He thanked him for his charitable candour, owned he had been a great sinner; but expressed his confidence in the mercies of Christ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thevet, a friar of the Franciscan order, which had suffered much for their espousing the cause of Queen Catherine, says, in his Cosmography, that, when Henry was on his death-bed, he professed an hearty sorrow for the treatment of Anne Boleyn.</NOTE>. When Denny proposed a ghostly director, he desired him to send for Archbishop Cran∣mer, who had retired to Croydon, that he might not be present, nor concerned in the scandalous bill of attainder against the Duke of Norfolk, who had always been his enemy. Before he reached the palace, on Friday, January 28, Henry was speechless, though not insensible; for, when the Archbishop desired him to make some sign of dying in the faith of Christ, he squeezed his hand with seeming fervour, and in a few
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>minutes expired, being then in the six and fiftieth year of his age. The King's death happening between the date of the warrant and the execution, the Duke of Norfolk was saved by this providential interposi∣tion; though there seems to have been some dispute in the council about his fate, for they concealed his Majesty's decease for three days; and then the Lord Chancellor declared the parliament dissolved.</P>
<P>Henry VIII.<NOTE PLACE="inter">His cha∣racter.</NOTE> before he became corpulent, was a Prince of a goodly personage, and commanding aspect, rather imperious than dignified. He excelled in all the exercises of youth, and possessed a good under∣standing, which was not much improved by the nature of his education. Instead of learning that philosophy which opens the mind, and extends the qualities of the heart, he was confined to the study of gloomy and scho∣lastic disquisitions, which served to cramp the ideas, and pervert the faculties of reason, qualifying him for the disputant of a cloister, rather than the lawgiver of a people. In the first years of his reign, his pride and vanity seemed to domineer over all his other passions, though from the beginning he was impetuous, head∣strong and impatient of contradiction and advice; and perhaps these qualities might contribute to enable him to govern a people, who seldom obey so well, as when a strict hand is kept over them, and are sometimes apt to despise mild, and trample upon weak, Princes. He was rash, arrogant, prodigal, vain-glorious, pedantic, and superstitious. He delighted in pomp and pageantry, the baubles of a weak mind. His passions soothed by adulation, rejected all restraint: and as he was an utter stranger to the finer feelings of the soul, he gra∣tified them at the expence of justice and humanity, without remorse or compunction. He wrested the su∣premacy from the Bishop of Rome, partly on conscien∣tious motives, and partly for reasons of state and con∣venience. He suppressed the monasteries, in order to
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>supply his extravagance with their spoils; but he would not have made those acquisitions so easily, had they not been productive of advantage to his nobility, and agreeable to great part of the nation. He was frequently at war, but the greatest conquest he ob∣tained was over his own parliament and people. Re∣ligious disputes had divided them into two factions. As he had it in his power to make either scale prepon∣derate, each courted his favour with the most obse∣quious submission, and in trimming the ballance he kept them both in subjection. In accustoming them∣selves to these abject compliances, they degenerated into slaves; and he from their prostitution acquired the most despotic authority. He became rapacious, arbitrary, froward, fretful, and so cruel that he seemed to take a delight in the blood of his subjects. He seldom betrayed any symptoms of tenderness in his disposition, and his kindness to Cranmer was an in∣consistency in his character. He seemed to live in defiance of censure, whether ecclesiastical or secular; he died in apprehension of futurity; and was buried at Windsor with idle processions, which in those days passed for real taste and magnificence.</P>

<P>EDWARD VI. succeeded his father on the throne of England, being then in the tenth year of his age. He had been educated under the care of Dr. Richard Cox and Sir John Cheeke; and when his fa∣ther made his exit, was with his sister Elizabeth at Hertford, from whence he was conducted by his uncle Edward Seymour Earl of Hertford, and Sir Thomas Brown, to the Tower of London, where he was received by the council in a body, and proclaimed King of England. Next day, the late King's will being opened, it appeared that Edward's majority was fixed at the age of fifteen: that sixteen persons were nominated as executors of the will, regents of the kingdom, and tutors to the young King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were Thomas Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor Wriothesly, Lord St. John Steward of the houshold, Lord Russel keeper of the Privy Seal, the Earl of Hertford Lord Chamberlain, John Dudley Viscount Lisle (in the sequel Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland) Cuthbert Tonstal Bishop of Durham, Sir Anthony Brown Master of the Horse, Sir William Pa∣get Secretary of State, Sir Edward North Chancellor of the Court of Augmentation, Sir Edward Montague Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, Mr. Bromley one of the twelve Judges, Sir Anthony Denny, Sir William Herbert Gentleman of the Privy-Chamber, Sir Edward Wotton Treasurer of Calais, and Dr. Wotton Dean of Canterbury and York. Stephen Gardiner Bishop of Winchester had been in the list, but his name was expunged from the will by Henry's own hand.</NOTE>; and that these, or the majority of them, were impowered to regulate the affairs of the administration. They likewise found
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>another council appointed to be aiding and assisting to the executors, when called upon for their advice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The assisting council consisted of Henry Fitz-Alan Earl of Arundel, William Parr Earl of Essex (soon after Marquis of Nor∣thampton) Sir Thomas Cheney Treasurer, Sir John Gage Comp∣troller of the Houshold, Sir Anthony Wingfield Chamberlain, Sir William Petre Secretary of State, Sir Richard Rich, Sir John Baker, Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Thomas Seymour, Sir Richard Southwell, and Sir Edward Peckham.</NOTE>. Henry's will being read in public, the regents and counsellors immediately took possession of their respec∣tive offices. Then some of the members observing, that it would be troublesome to the people, and espe∣cially to foreign ministers, to address themselves to sixteen different persons of equal authority, proposed, that one of the number should be chosen as chief and president, under the title of protector. This proposal was strongly opposed by Sir Thomas Wriothesley, Lord Chancellor, who foresaw the choice would fall on the Earl of Hertford, with whom he had been long at variance, on account of religion. His objections, however, were over-ruled; and Hertford was chosen protector of the realm, and governor of the King's person, on this express condition, that he should do nothing without the consent of the other regents. It having been insinuated that the late King intended to make some promotions among his courtiers, evidences were examined touching those intentions; and, in con∣sequence of their depositions, there were several persons enobled, and others advanced to higher titles. Among those so distinguished were the Earl of Hertford, pro∣moted to the title of the Duke of Somerset, Sir Thomas Wriothesley created Earl of Southampton, and Sir Thomas Seymour, the protector's brother, made Baron Seymour of Sudley, and appointed Admiral of Eng∣land. About the same time, Somerset was advanced to the offices of Lord Treasurer and Earl Marshal, vacant by the condemnation of the Duke of Norfolk.
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>The obsequies of Henry were solemnized on February 13, and on the 20th the young King was crowned; on which occasion Archbishop Cranmer admonished his Majesty, that, as Christ's vicar within his own do∣mions, he was to take care that God should be truly worshipped, idolatry rooted out, his subjects preserved from subjection to the Bishop of Rome, and images removed from all the churches in his kingdom. At this juncture an amnesty was published, from which however the Duke of Norfolk, Cardinal Pole, Edward Courteney, eldest son of the Marquis of Exeter, and three others persons, were excluded.</P>
<P>The Earl of Southampton, being a man of a fiery, ambitious, turbulent disposition, whose politics and re∣ligion were different from those of the protector, this last resolved to take the first opportunity to expell him from the regency. He had granted a commission under the great seal to certain substitutes, to hear and decide causes in chancery, in the same manner as if himself were present. This step he had taken of his own simple authority, without the consent of the King or the other regents. This affair being communicated to the council, the judges were ordered to give their opinion on the subject; and they unanimously declared, that the Chancellor could not delegate his power to any other persons, without the consent of the King and regency, otherwise he forfeited his office, and be∣came liable to fine and imprisonment. When this de∣claration was intimated to him in full council, he in∣veighed against the Judges, and even reviled the council and protector. His behaviour exasperated the members to such a degree, that he was confined to his own house, and deprived of the great seal; but he was afterwards released from confinement, on his giving se∣curity for the payment of the fine to which he should be adjudged. Having removed this troublesome op∣ponent, Somerset informed his colleagues, that the foreign ambassadors scrupled to treat with him until they
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>knew the extent of his power; and desired that his pro∣tectorship should be established by patent. They deemed the proposal reasonable, and joined with him in a petition to the King, who, by patent, March 12, constituted the Duke of Somerset governor of his person, and protector of his realm and subjects. He had all the regeney (except the Earl of Southampton) and the twelve additional counsellors, assigned to him for ad∣visers; but they were tied up from doing any thing without his consent and advice; whereas he was im∣powered to admit to the privy council any person whom he might think proper, and in conjunction with any number of the counsellors, whom he should chuse to convene, to annul or change whatever they thought fit to alter or abolish. By this he enlarged his own authority, but entailed the hatred and envy of many of the nobility, which he felt severely in the sequel.</P>
<P>Henry VIII. had no sooner given up the ghost, than the friends of the reformation congratulated them∣selves on the event. They no longer suppressed their sentiments on religion; but maintained their doctrines openly in preaching and teaching, even whilst the laws continued against them in full force. Indeed, at this juncture, they had very little to fear from their ad∣versaries. The King himself was bred up in the re∣formed religion, and had already given surprising proofs of genius, capacity, and an amiable disposition, averse to cruelty and persecution. The protector professed the same doctrines, which were espoused by Thomas Cranmer and Robert Holgate, primates of Canterbury and York, Henry Holbech Bishop of Lincoln, Tho∣mas Goodrich of Ely, and William Barlow of St. David's, together with Dr. Nicholas Ridley. Hugh Latimer late Bishop of Worcester, by this time released from his prison (to which he had been sent soon after the resignation of his see) and though he declined the resumption of his episcopal character, living in a private manner with Cranmer, yet nevertheless assisted very
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>much in the work of reformation by his talents in preaching<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 13 of this volume.</NOTE>. Bishop Gardiner, perceiving, that, since the regency, and the people in general, favoured a reformation, his opposition would be of very little service to Popery, endeavoured to check the progress of Protestant tenets, by representing to the protector, that innovations during a minority would produce confusion and disturbance in the state, and proposing that religious matters should continue as they were at the death of the late King, until the reigning Prince should take the reigns of government into his own hands. Very little regard was paid to these insinua∣tions, although Gardiner was supported by Edmund Bonner Bishop of London, and Cuthbert Tonstal of Durham: but the chief of the party was the Princess Mary, who openly avowed the regulations of her fa∣ther, and particularly the act of the six articles. The inferior clergy derived their chief subsistence from the sacramental fees, and especially by singing of masses for the departed souls of the poor, for which they received two-pence a mass; and therefore were ene∣mies to the reformation and alteration of the church-service. Nevertheless, the regency, who had supplied the Protestants of Germany with 30,000 crowns, appointed, at Cranmer's instance, a general visitation of all the churches in England; of which more fully afterwards.</P>
<P>The Duke of Somerset's next attention was to the war with Scotland. Henry had, in his last illness, laid strong injunctions upon his executors to effect, if pos∣sible, the match between his son and Mary Queen of that country. The French party prevailing in Scot∣land, there was but little prospect of executing what he so much desired, in any other way but by force of arms: the protector therefore began to make prepa∣rations for prosecuting the war with Scotland, while
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>the French King declared, that he would not abandon his old allies in their distress. At the instance of the French ambassadors, Somerset consented to try the effect of negociation, before he should commence any hostilities.</P>
<P>The negociation proving fruitless,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Battle of Pinkey.</NOTE> the pro∣tector entered Scotland, in the beginning of September, with an army of fifteen thousand infantry, and three thousand horse, well appointed, provided with a train of artillery. The Scotch, having raised an army of 30,000 men; well provided with am∣munition, arms and ordinance, took post near Mussle∣burgh, within four miles of Edinburgh, in order to attack the English in their march. The famous battle of Pinkey or Mussleburgh ensued, on September 10, when the Scotch, having maintained an advantageous post, which the English durst not attack them in, abandoned it, imagining the English about to retreat, and fearing they should escape in the night, drew their forces up in a line of battle, and advanced to attack them. Their impetuosity not only saved the English (then in want of provisions) from a dangerous retreat, but threw victory into the hands of Somerset, whose troops made a most horrible carnage among the Scotch, with inconsiderable loss to themselves. The Duke of So∣merset was prevented from availing himself of the consternation which filled Scotland immediately after this battle, and from improving the other advantages of his success, by the intrigues of his brother in England. Having plundered and burned Leith, and all the neighbouring villages on the sea-side, made an unsuc∣cessful attempt on the castle of Edinburgh, and for∣tified Inchcolm, in the Firth of Forth, with Broughty castle near the mouth of the Tay, he returned to Eng∣land, where he was rewarded by the King with lands to the value of five hundred pounds a-year.</P>
<P>The Duke of Somerset acquired great popularity by this prosperous expedition; but at the same time
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>attracted the envy of several noblemen: nor did he seem to bear his fortune with moderation. Thomas, Lord Sudley,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Intrigues against the protector by his brother.</NOTE> High Admiral, a man of uncommon talents, but proud, turbulent and untractable, was in the number of those who envied the prosperity of the pro∣tector. He beheld, with discontent, the distinction which King Henry made between him and his elder bro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, with whom he thought himself equally inti∣titled to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>are in the administration. Sudley had ad∣dressed himself to the Princess Elizabeth on the score of marriage; but not succeeding in that pursuit, he in∣sinuated himself into the affection of the Queen Dowa∣ger, Catherine Parr, who gave him her hand in pri∣vate, immediately after the death of Henry. He found means to obtain from the King a letter, ex∣pressing his desire that such a match should be effected, and then he published his marriage in open defiance of the protector. He made a party among the nobi∣lity, who, as they hated his brother, fomented his am∣bition. And young Edward going frequently to his house, to see his step mother, he ingratiated himself with his sovereign, by an affected affability, officious∣ness, and complaisance, and supplying him with money, without the knowledge of his governor. While the protector was in Scotland, he redoubled all his art and insinuation, and obtained, from the King, a new patent for admiral, with an additional appointment. Before Somerset arrived, he had engaged in his party some privy counsellors, several noblemen of distinction, and a great number of the members of the lower house of parliament. He prevailed on the King to write a letter to the two houses of parliament, desiring the Ad∣miral might be appointed his governor; but, before this was delivered, the council, being apprised of his de∣sign, sent to assure him if he did not desist, they would deprive him of his office, send him to the Tower, and prosecute him on the last act of parliament, which
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>made it high treason to attempt disturbing the order of government. Being intimidated at this, he hum∣bled himself before the council, and was seemingly reconciled to the protector.</P>
<P>During Somerset's absence, the persons appointed to visit the churches, had performed their task without opposition, except from Gardiner Bishop of Winchester, and Bonner Bishop of London, who refused to obey the order of council, and were therefore committed to prison. The Lord Rich was created Chancellor; and the parliament, meeting on November 4, manifested the greatest attachment to the protector. They repealed all the acts touching high treason, which had passed since the reign of Edward III. all acts of felony specified since the rupture with the Pope; the statute which vested the King's proclamation with the power of an act of parlia∣ment; two acts passed against the Lollards; and the famous statute of the six articles. The King's supremacy was confirmed anew; and the pains of treason were decreed against those heirs of the crown mentioned in Henry's will, who should attempt to disturb the order of succession. The benefit of clergy, and the privi∣leges of sanctuary, were restored; from these however, assassins, and four sort of thieves, were excluded. Pri∣vate masses were prohibited, and the people permitted to receive the communion in both species. The King was impowered to fill vacant bishoprics, so that sham <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ections were entirely abolished. The cognizance of matrimonial or testamentary causes was transferred from ecclesiastical courts, to those of the regal jurisdiction; and they passed a law, enacting, that if any common person should refrain from working, or at least from offering to work, for the space of three days, he should be branded in the face with a red hot iron, and be∣come the slave of the informer. This rigorous decree was levelled against the monks, who, since the dissolu∣tion of the monasteries, instead of working for their livelihood, strolled from family to family, and endea∣voured to breed disturbance in the state. Finally, they
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>granted to Edward all the foundations for chantries, chapels, and colleges, of which Henry had not al∣ready taken possession. This act met with great op∣position from several prelates, and from Cranmer in particular. He hoped to find some opportunity of converting those benefactions to religious purposes; whereas, by being in the hands of the King, the church would be deprived of them for ever. But he was not able to carry his point. The nobility thirsted after the effects of the church, and these they easily obtained from the court: and the executors of Henry's will wanted money to pay his debts and legacies. The session was concluded with an act of amnesty, from which the prisoners in the Tower were excluded; but as Gardiner had been confined in the Fleet, he enjoyed the benefit of the statute.</P>
<P>We have already taken notice of the state of the two parties who favoured and opposed a reformation of those innovations in doctrine, and superstitions in prac∣tice, which the Popes, the monks, or schoolmen, had introduced in the days of ignorance: but the friends of protestantism lay under some disadvantages by rea∣son of Edward's minority, and a strong party in op∣position to their designs: and as we have given a detail of the most remarkable civil transactions, we shall now proceed to give an account of the steps taken, as well before as in the convocation, for re∣moving of the causes of complaint. It was probably with a view to pave the way for this work, that Cran∣mer had taken out, on February 7, a royal commission, impowering him to exercise, during the King's plea∣sure, all manner of coercive jurisdiction in all causes cognizable by spiritual courts and ecclesiastical persons, over and above the powers committed in the scriptures by divine authority. It hath always been a maxim in the law of England, that all coactive jurisdiction is derived from the crown, no court can be held, no oath administered, but in virtue of the royal authority;
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>and when Robert Grosthead (alias Grouthead) Bishop of Lincoln from 1235 to 1254, in his zeal for reform∣ing the lives and manners of persons that lay under an evil fame, first offered to introduce the oath <HI>ex officio,</HI> for discovery of secret lewdness that gave no scandal, it occasioned a complaint of parliament, and, had it not been for his extraordinary merit, and known inte∣grity, would have been severely punished. Bracton, an eminent English lawyer, who flourished in the 13th century, and wrote a book <HI>de consuetudinibus Angliae,</HI> saith, "That matters relating to jurisdiction, peace, and justice, belong to none but the crown and dig∣nity royal, nor can they be separated from the crown, nor be possessed by any private person." Causes of testaments, matrimony, adultery, and illegitimacy, being subjected by William the Conqueror to the cog∣nizance of ecclesiastical or spiritual persons, were for that reason commonly called ecclesiastical causes, and the courts, wherein they were tried, denominated spi∣ritual: but those judicatures were erected by the civil power, and the exercise of their jurisdiction became difficult after the passing of some acts in the late reign, for establishing the King's supremacy, and abolishing all ecclesiastical laws, repugnant either to the laws of the land, or the royal prerogative. Thirty two com∣missioners had been appointed to revise those laws; but they had made no report; and it was still uncertain what particular canons or constitutions might be deemed by common lawyers to come under that cha∣racter. Cranmer and all the Bishops at that time had been put into possession of their sees, in consequence of the Pope's bulls: and occasion might thence have been taken to suggest, that they exercised their ordi∣nary jurisdiction, as Wolsey had done his legatine, in virtue of the papal authority, which would subject them to a premunire. This had rendered it necessary for them in point of prudence to take out commissions from Henry for exercising their jurisdiction, in subor∣dination
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>to his authority, and for as long as he thought proper. Cranmer, either out of an abundant caution, or to set an example for making other Prelates depen∣dant on the King and Council, thought fit, upon the expiration of that commission which he had received from Henry, to take out a new one from Edward. Bonner, and the rest of the Bishops, took out the like commissions, for exercising their jurisdiction during the King's pleasure: but, whatever alarm seized them at first, the Bishops soon got over their fears, and such commissions were reputed needless; Ridley not having any when promoted to the see of London, and none being ever issued afterwards.</P>
<P>The advocates for Popery could not complain of the visitation of the churches being an inno∣vation,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A general vi∣sitation of the churches in England.</NOTE> as it agreed with the late King's injunctions, which had been published, though not duly executed, in his time; and the people were more ready to receive it, as they had some knowledge of it be∣fore. Cranmer, and his friends, obtained letters-patent from the regency for a visitation over Eng∣land, during which all Bishops were prohibited from preaching in any place but their own cathe∣drals, and other ecclesiastics were restricted to their respective churches, unless provided with the King's special licence. The kingdom was divided into six separate districts or circuits; and the number of visitors, for each, consisted of two gentlemen, a civilian, a divine, and a register. They were armed, as well with powers for enquiring into all ecclesiastical matters, as with injunctions which all persons were required to observe. These enjoined the clergy to take care, that the laws against the papacy, and for asserting the royal supremacy, were duly observed; and to teach their congregations, at least four times a year, that the first had been justly abolished, as a mere usurpation, and the latter a rightful power, which it was their duty to
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. They were to persuade the people from pil∣grimages, worship of images, and other superstitious practices; to take down and destroy such images as had been so abused; and to suffer no more wax candles or tapers to be burnt before any image. All shrines, rolls of wax, paintings, and other monuments of ido∣latry, and feigned miracles, were to be removed out of the walls and windows of churches: and a pulpit was to be erected in every church for preaching<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was a form of <HI>bidding-prayer</HI> enjoined by the visitors, to be used by all preachers. The latter part of it run thus: "You are to pray for all them that be departed out of this world in the faith of Christ, that they with us, and we with them, at the day of judge∣ment, may rest both in body and soul with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven."</NOTE>. Upon every holiday, when there was no sermon, the Lord's prayer, the creed, and the ten commandments, were to be recited out of the pulpit to the parishioners: and all that came to confession in Lent, were to be exa∣mined, whether they could repeat them before they were admitted to the sacrament. The epistle and gos∣pel, at high mass, were to be read in English; and, on every Sunday and holiday, a chapter of the New Testament was to be read in the morning, and one of the Old at evening, service, in English. All processions in the church and church-yard, were forbidden; and the litany, which used to be sung in them, was for the future to be said or sung in the choir, in English. A register was to be carefully kept in every parish, for marriages, christenings, and burials: and no body was to preach any where, besides in his own church, with∣out a special licence. In churches, where they had not an English Bible of the larger size, one was to be provided in three months; and, before a year expired, Erasmus's Paraphrase of the four Gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles, lately translated into English, was likewise to be provided, and placed in every church for people to read therein. Every clergyman, under the
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>degree of Batchelor of Divinity, was also obliged to procure a copy of the same paraphrase for his own use and Bishops were, by themselves or their officers, to examine what proficiency they made in the study o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the scriptures. The Bishops were particularly charged to see these injunctions observed in their dioceses; and to set forth nothing contrary to the doctrine contained in the homilies, published by authority.</P>
<P>These homilies had been approved in the convo∣cation, A. D. 1542: and the visitors carried with them copies thereof, which were delivered to the mi∣nisters of parishes, for the instruction of their congre∣gations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The generality of the common people had esteemed the priest as mountebanks, who had charms or secrets for the salvation of souls, and therefore thought nothing was further necessary than to commit, implicitly, their spiritual concerns to the skill of such emperi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Others were taught to believe, that, if they magnified Christ, and depended wholly upon his mercies and intercession, they should be saved, even though they led the most profligate lives.

Some learned and eminent preachers attend∣ed them likewise in their visitations; and exerted their talents wherever they passed, in teaching people the true principles of religion, and dissuading them from praying to saints, adoring images, the use of beads, candles, ashes, palms, processions, and prayers in un∣known languages. It was at first proposed, that these visitations should be made in May; but the visitors did not set out till August; and the injunctions were every where pretty well received, and generally observed. In some places, as at Portsmouth, and in London, at St. Martin's in Ironmongers-lane, the zeal of certain persons was too warm to wait a reformation from the vi∣sitors, and, without any directions, they demolished the images and pictures of saints that were in the churches and, to set an example to the rest of the kingdom, the
<PB N="77" REF="78"/><HI>compline</HI> (a part of the evening service) had been sung on the Easter Monday, in the English tongue, in the King's chapel. Cranmer published a catechism for the instruction of young people and children, which was afterwards approved in convocation; the book <HI>De vera differentia inter regiam potestatem et eccl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siasticam,</HI> translated into English by Henry Lord Stafford, son of the last Duke of Buckingham, and Herman<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">He was Archbishop and Elector of Cologne from 1515 to 1546, when he was deposed for embracing the Protestant religion, and died in 1552.</NOTE>, Arch∣bishop of Cologne's book, against the corruptions of Popery, translated by another hand, were printed, with other treatises against solitary masses, and other Romish novelties, to prepare the nation for the altera∣tions proposed to be made in parliament.</P>
<P>There appeared at the same time several books writ∣ten by the partizans of Papacy; some of them by Gar∣diner Bishop of Winchester; all exclaiming against the English translation of the scriptures, which they did not think proper to be communicated to the people, for fear of promoting dissensions in religion; though they opposed, with vehemence, the removing of images, which had been notoriously abused to the practice of idolatry. The school distinction between material and formal idolatry,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Reflections up∣on images and pictures in churches.</NOTE> and the pretences that the worship, though direct∣ed immediately towards the image, doth not terminate there, but in the person re∣presented, or in Christ himself, seem designed to tre∣pan people into a practice abhorred by the primitive Christians: and in places where images are retained, constant experence shews how impracticable it is, by any instructions, to restrain the ignorant people from falling into gross idolatry. The apologists for the Christian religion, and the works of the fathers, of the first four hundred years of the gospel, afford irrefra∣gable
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>proofs of the detestation, they universally had, of all images and pictures used in religious worship. They would suffer none in their churches; and the zeal of St. Epiphanius, who flourished at the latter end of the fourth century, in tearing and destroying the picture (probably of some saint) painted on a veil, which he chanced to see in his travels, is the more re∣markable, because it was in a church where he had no jurisdiction, that he shewed this instance of his in∣dignation. The plea of the worship's being directed, not so much to the image or picture, as to the invisible Being they were designed to represent, did not then serve for a just excuse. Aaron and the Israelites con∣sidered the golden calf only as a symbolical representa∣tion of the true God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt; and the feast, which they celebrated in its honour, was proclaimed by Aaron as a feast to the Lord, to Jehovah, the appropriate name of the true God: and yet they were guilty of idolatry. If the common people, who are much alike in all countries and ages, among the Heathen were so stupid as to ter∣minate their worship in an image, their philosophers did not renounce their reason so far as to mistake the idol for a Deity. They almost universally believed one supreme, infinite, eternal mind, that gave being to the world, and all things therein; but as he was invisible and incomprehensible, they thought they might wor∣ship him in his visible effects, and by corporeal repre∣sentations; but to him was their worship ultimately directed. Any person, acquainted with the mytho∣logy of the ancients, knows this to be the case; and it appears from the writings of Origen, Arnobius, and Eusebius, against them, that these were their real sen∣timents, and that they made this apology for themselves, though it did not save them from the guilt of idola∣try.</P>
<P>The injunctions were readily received by all the Bishops, except Gardiner Bishop of Winchester, and
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>Bonner Bishop of London, as before-mentioned. Gardi∣ner, being called before the council, affirmed, that the homilies contained manifest contradictions, and excluded charity from justification. He offered to dispute upon this subject, at Oxford, against any opponent soever; and he exclaimed against the paraphrase of Erasmus, which he said was bad enough in the original, but much worse in the translation. Notwithstanding all his ar∣guments, he was sent to the Fleet, from whence he sent a letter, in vindication of himself, to the Protec∣tor upon his return from Scotland; and the Princess Mary also wrote to that Nobleman in the Prelate's be∣half: but Somerset paid very little regard to their re∣monstrances, and Gardiner remained in prison till the close of the session of parliament, when he obtained his liberty by the act of indemnity before mentioned. Bon∣ner being summoned before the visitors in the cathe∣dral of St. Paul, on October 1, and having a copy of the injunctions delivered to him, with the homilies published by authority, received them indeed, but with a protestation, "That he would observe them if they were not contrary to the law of God and the statutes and ordinances of the church." He desired this protest might be enrolled among the acts of the court: but soon after, "upon better considering his duty of obedience, and the evil example that might thence ensue to others, it appeared to him neither rea∣sonable nor consistent with the duty of a subject; and therefore he revoked his protest, desiring the Lords of the council, that his revocation thereof might likewise be put in the same records of the visitation, for a per∣petual memory of the truth, and that they would me∣diate with his Majesty for the pardon of his unadvised action." This humble submission and retractation had such an effect upon the Lords, that, though they thought it necessary, for a terror to others, and for asserting their own authority, to shew their resentment at the insinuations couched in the protest, to the pre∣judice
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>of the injunctions, and the exaltation of the ec∣clesiastical canons and constitutions above the royal authority, to send him, on September 11, to the Fleet, they soon set him at liberty, and he sat in the next parliament and convocation. He joined not only with the chapter of St. Paul's, in causing the in∣junctions to be observed in that cathedral, where the litany was now sung, and the epistle and gospel read, in English, and all the images (that of Christ being called the <HI>Rood</HI>) taken down; but also with Bellassere, Archdeacon of Colchester, and Gilbert Bourn (after∣wards Bishop of Bath, but then) Archdeacon of Lon∣don and Essex, who were both very zealous and offi∣cious in the work, in making the like reform in all the churches of London and the rest of his diocese. This was done with so much diligence, that, before the end of November, all images were removed thence, and divine service performed according to the injunc∣tions.</P>
<P>The convocation having met on November 5, the day after the meeting of the parliament, Archbishop Cranmer,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings in convoca∣tion, or at its instance.</NOTE> in a speech, exhort∣ed the clergy to an assiduity in studying the scriptures: and pressed them to consider seriously, what things were in the church that needed reformation; in order to throw out all the Romish trash and novelties, which had not yet been removed. Some of them, on this occasion, intimating to him, that so long as the statute of the six articles stood in force, it was not safe to deliver their opinions, he represented it to the council, which caused that stature's being repealed, as before related: but the re∣peal provided, "That all who denied the King's supre∣macy, or asserted the Pope's, in words, should, for the first offence, forfeit their goods and chattels, and be imprisoned during the King's pleasure; for the se∣cond, incur the pains of a premunire; and for the third, be attainted of high treason.</P>

This ordinance seems to have been signed in the first of these sessions by the Bishops, for in the fifth it was brought by the Prolo∣cutor from the upper to the lower house, and was sign∣ed that day by several of the members, though the rest of the members, sixty-four in all, did not subscribe it till the next day, which made the sixth session, when they expressed their approbation thereof, <HI>nullo recla∣mante.</HI> So perfect an unanimity, at a time when the minds of men were agitated by continual disputes, would appear very surprising, were it not for the clear∣ness of a maxim, upon which their decision seems to have been founded, and which instructs us, "that in actions, the benefits whereof arise, not from the na∣ture of the act, but purely from its institution, we are religiously to stick close to that institution."

<P>On December 16, the eighth session of the convo∣cation, a point of discipline, that had been sometime in debate, was determined:<NOTE PLACE="inter">Considerations on the celibacy of the clergy.</NOTE> it related to the celibacy of the clergy. It is evident from scripture, that, under the Mosaic law, the Jewish priests were married, their of∣fice descending by inheritance; and that, under the gospel oeconomy, St. Peter was a married man, as some other apostles also were, all of them enjoying that liberty. It was indeed a qualification required in a Bishop, that he should be the husband of but one wife; yet this very restraint shews, that marriage was not forbidden to the inferior orders of the clergy, when it was allowed in those who were advanced to the highest ecclesiastical dignity. An affectation of more than ordinary purity and austerity beginning to prevail, a motion was made, in the council of Nice, A. D. 325, for a law to prohibit the marriage of the clergy. The motion was rejected, chiefly (as the ec∣clesiastical

<PB N="84" REF="87"/>historians relate) upon the arguments alledged against it by Paphnutius; who, though himself un∣married, opposed it vehemently, and shewed the un∣reasonableness of such a prohibition. St. Gregory Na∣zianzen's father was a Bishop, and begat him after his consecration. St. Jerome observes, that, in his time, the married Bishops were numberless; and some of the Bishops of Rome, even after the time of Leo the Great, who died A. D. 461, were the sons of married priests. Canons were indeed made, in several churches, re∣straining the clergy from marrying, after they had been ordained: but they do not seem to have been received in England; where even such as lived in mona∣steries and collegiate societies, had their wives and fa∣milies with them, till the conquest, except in a few convents, reformed upon Dunstan's plan by King Edgar. After the conquest, Archbishop Lanfranc imposed celibacy upon the Prebendaries of cathedral and collegiate churches; but allowed the parochial clergy, living in towns and villages, the use of mar∣riage already contracted. John de Crema, the Pope's Legate, got a canon passed in the synod, in 1125, for turning all the married clergy out of their benefices: but it never took place in Wales, and was very little observed in England. The compositions made with Henry I. and the protection he gave the married clergy, hindered the canon from being at first put in execu∣tion: and the Bishops, seeing it could not be done without a strong opposition, and great disturbances, chose to grant them licences for marrying secretly, and connived at their keeping wives in their houses, under the stile of <HI>concubines,</HI> as was the case of other western churches. Some constitutions were indeed made against such clandestine marriages, but it was only for shew; they were seldom or never executed: and some Bishops<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The late famous M. Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux in France, ob∣tained a licence from the Pope to marry privately: and when it was produced before the parliament of Paris, they adjudged his estate and effects to his widow and children, who were declared to be legitimate.</NOTE>, as well as others of the clergy, con∣tinued
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>to live secretly with their wives till the time of the reformation. When the act passed, in the 27th of Henry VIII. empowering the Archbishop of Canter∣bury to grant licences, dispensations, and faculties, in matters not contrary to the holy scriptures, and the laws of God, and declaring all such licence, &amp;c. should stand in full force and authority, without being liable to any future repeal; several priests obtained dispensa∣tions of marriage, some of them corroborated by the King's great seal, others only by the Archbishop. Henry being informed, by some of the Popish party, that many priests, as well regular as secular, had been married without authority, did, at their instigation, publish, in the 30th year of his reign, a proclamation, forbidding that practice for the future, but not dissol∣ving the marriages already contracted. These were, however, dissolved in the next year, by the statute of the six articles, and many so married were divorced: but a good number still retained their wives, and, though the King was told of it from time to time, he willingly tolerated such as kept their marriages secret. As for those, that were openly known to be married, he did not separate them from their wives, but ordered them to be reputed as lay-persons; and was inclined to give a full liberty in this point to all the clergy, had he not been hindered by some papal zealots in his coun∣cil, as he declared his mind to several that he talked with on the subject.</P>
<P>Such was the state of the clergy in England, when a proposition was laid before the lower house of convocation to this effect,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Marriage of the clergy al∣lowed by the convocation.</NOTE> "That all such canons, laws, statutes, decrees, customs, and usages, heretofore made, had, or used, that forbid any person to con∣tract
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>matrimony, or condemn matrimony by any per∣son already contracted, for any vows of priesthood, chastity, or widowhood, shall from henceforth be ut∣terly void, and of none effect." It was agreed to by a great majority, fifty-three being for it, and only twenty-two opposing the proposition: and it is remarkable, that among those who were for it, several were not then or ever afterwards married, as the Doctors Tay∣lor, Benson, Redman, Hugh Weston, Mr. Wotton, &amp;c. and that some of the opponents, Oken, Rayner, and Wilson, took afterwards the liberty of marrying. This determination was made in convocation, on Saturday December 17; and, on the Monday following, a bill for enabling married men to be priests, and to hold benefices, was brought into the house of Commons, and had then its first reading. It was, the next day, read the second and third times, passed, and sent up to the house of Lords: but some debates arising on the subject, there was not time to go through it, before the end of the session; the parliament being prorogued on Christmas eve.</P>
<P>A. D. 1548.] In the beginning of the next year the council made several alterations in the ceremonies of religion. They issued an order, in January, that there should be no creeping to the cross, no candles should be borne on Candlemas-day, nor palms on Palm-Sunday<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 455 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>. This being transmitted by Cranmer to Bonner (who, as Bishop of London, was reputed Dean of his province, and charged with the execution of his mandates, and the distribution of his letters-missive) was by him dispersed to the rest of the Bishops within the province of Canterbury: and these ceremonies were accordingly laid aside. The orders, frequently given for the removal of images, that had been abused to superstition, had not yet been fully executed; some of which had been taken away, during the late visitation,
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>had been since set up again: and nothing could be more shocking than some pictures designed to repre∣sent the Trinity, with the blessed virgin Mary sit∣ting between the two first persons, under a dove with expanded wings, as if she had been assumed into it: this occasioned another order, on February 11, for their removal.</P>
<P>Some of the country clergy and laity, seeing the steps taken by the government towards a reformation,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proclamation against un∣authorised, innovations, and for keep∣ing Lent.</NOTE> and presuming upon its fa∣vour or connivance, took it into their heads, without any warrant, to omit, al∣ter, and innovate the rites and ceremonies of the church, as was most to their liking. This being likely to promote dissensions and distur∣bances, the council, who were for proceeding regular∣ly and by degrees, lest weak people should be shocked at too sudden and general a change, judged it necessary, on February 6, to issue a proclamation, forbidding all such unauthorised and disorderly innovations, on pain of imprisonment, and further punishments. To refute the suggestions of some enemies to the intended reformation, who made it their business to alarm peo∣ple with apprehensions, as if every thing, that was ancient and serviceable to devotion, would be soon a∣bolished, they had a little before, on December 27, set forth a proclamation against irreverent talkers of the sacrament, and, by another published on January 16, enjoined all persons to abstain from flesh in Lent: and the King's table was served with lenten diet, during all that season.</P>

It was the business of the protector and council to see this order executed: and they sent, on March 13, a sufficient number of printed copies of the service to all the Bishops in the kingdom, with letters "requiring them to exert their care and diligence in the delivery thereof to all the incumbents and curates within their several dioceses, that they might have time to instruct themselves for the distribution, and their parishioners for the reception of the holy communion, before the next Easter, that a per∣fect uniformity might be universally observed through∣out the nation." The communion-service was received over England without any opposition: nor was it in∣deed liable to any objection in itself; those, that were most addicted to the old superstitions, having no pre∣tence to complain of any thing but bare omissions, such as of the elevation and adoration of the host, and some needless ceremonies of an indifferent nature; and that auricular <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nfession was only recommended in certain cases, and left to the discretion of the penitent, upon whose sincerity all the use of it entirely depends,
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>the compilers not daring to declare any thing necessary, which the scripture had not made so, much less to ascribe such a necessity to a practice unknown to the primitive church in the purest ages of the gospel. Several Bishops, though they complied with what had been done against their inclination, were still appre∣hensive of further changes: and encouraged preachers to instil prejudices into the people, against every thing that might come from the government, during the King's minority; charging the council with a design of forcing them to pay half a crown a man for every marriage, christening, and burial. As insinuations of that nature had contributed very much to the in∣surrection, in Yorkshire, in the last reign<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See page 462 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>, the re∣gency, to prevent the like mischiefs that might natu∣rally arise, from such seditious sermons, published a proclamation on April 24, ordering, "that none should be allowed to preach, but such as were licensed under the seals of the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Lord Protector."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">A new litur∣gy compiled, and all preaching in∣hibited till its establish∣ment.</NOTE> Notwithstanding all the caution used in granting licences to preach, several of those who had obtained them, slighted the King's injunctions, and declaimed in the pulpit against his authority, as well as proceedings. Many also of the beneficed clergy, though they pretended to comply with every order, and had received the new communion-service, did all they could to prejudice people against it: either curtailing it, or hurrying and slubbering it over in such a man∣ner, as to render it unintelligible; whilst others, de∣claring themselves more openly, did not use it at all, but said their masses as formerly. To correct these irregu∣larities, and prevent the evil consequences thereof, no method appeared so likely to succeed, as the drawing up of a public liturgy, and getting it confirmed by
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>parliament, with penalties to be inflicted on all that should not conform to its rules and directions. The late order, for administering the eucharist, in the English tongue, had not yet received the sanction of that authority, being authorised only by the convoca∣tion, and an act of the council of regency; and, tho' disaffected persons were apt to consider it as a proceed∣ing, not so much from the King himself as from a few persons about him, yet, when the King's pleasure came to be known by an act of parliament, it might be presumed, that all evils being removed, every body would submit to it, and conform without further trouble. With these expectations, the council, on September 1, sent for the committee of Bishops and Divines, who had lately drawn up the communion-service, and had been impowered likewise to revise and reform all the offices and divine service: and re∣commended to them the compiling of <HI>a public liturgy,</HI> which should contain the order or morning and even∣ing prayer, together with a form of ministering the sacraments, and the like for all religious offices. They readily undertook the work, in which, it is very pro∣bable, they had already made a considerable progress; and the King, by a proclamation, on the 23d of that month, notified it to all his subjects; "inhibiting at the same time all persons, whether licensed or not, from preach∣ing in open audience, in the pulpit or otherwise, till the proposed liturgy should be published. The clergy were exhorted, in the mean time, to apply themselves by prayers to God for the good execution and success of the undertaking, and the people to be content with the homilies set forth by authority, and prepare them∣selves with a thankful obedience, to receive a most quiet, godly, and uniform order, throughout all his dominions."—There was then, and probably had always been, a great diversity in the forms of prayer, rites, and ceremonies, used in the churches of England: but there were five liturgies more generally followed
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>than others, viz. those for the use of the churches of Sarum, Lincoln, York, Bangor and Hereford. There was the like diversity in the divine offices of all Chris∣tian countries; it being a consequence of the power vested in all Bishops, and exercised by them from the time of the Apostles, of appointing liturgies for their respective dioceses: and this caused such a variety therein, that an ancient ecclesiastical historian observes, "that there were scarce two churches to be found, which, in their rites and forms of prayer, agreed entirely with one another." Each religious order, as it was founded, had its peculiar liturgy; there were no less than fifty different volumes of different offices used in the churches of the city of Rome, when Pope Nicholas III. in the thirteenth century, ordered them to be laid aside, to make way for the uniform observance of that which was used in his own chapel: and Walafrid Strabo, who flou∣rished in the ninth century, says, in the first chapter of his book, <HI>de rebus ecclesiasticis, et horis canonicis,</HI> "that in his time the diversity of offices was in a manner in∣finite, not only with regard to different languages and nations, but even in the same province, according to the different institutions of Bishops. It could not reasonably be expected, that any body should be so perverse, as to dispute the authority of a national church, in ordering its own form of divine worship, when every single Bishop enjoyed the same power with∣in his diocese.—It was likewise intended that the new liturgy should remove all dissensions, and bring the people to an uniformity in their religious opinions, as well as in divine worship. With this view it was so contrived, as, not only by the portions of scripture appointed for each day's service in such an order, that the Old Testament should be read over once, and the New thrice, a-year, in every church in the realm, but likewise by the prayers themselves, to instruct people in all the essential doctrines, and great duties, of the Christian religion, that they might know what was
<PB N="92" REF="95"/>necessary for them, either to practise or believe, in order to salvation. No feasts instituted to support the notions of schoolmen, no prayers founded on scholas∣tic niceties, or the fabulous and uncertain legends of saints, nothing but what is agreeable to the true, ge∣nuine, clear, and indisputed doctrines of the gospel, found place in a composition, which contained as ra∣tional, as Christian, and as instructive a body of de∣votion, as was perhaps ever used in public worship. The constant use of such a liturgy has been generally allowed to be a more efficacious means of cultivating in people a religious turn of mind, of improving them in the knowledge of God, of keeping them in the faith of Christ, and of disposing them to the practice of their duty, than all the studied harangues, and transient ex∣hortations of preachers: and to these ends it was ad∣mirably adapted by the compilers. None of these ends could be advanced by the former offices, being in a language unknown to those who most wanted instruc∣tion. The effect likewise of what appeared most com∣mendable in those offices was defeated, or impaired, by such an excessive multitude of useless rites and cere∣monies, as became an intolerable grievance; some of them light and theatrical, others abused to superstition, and the rest serving to encourage such a reliance on ex∣ternal observances, as naturally made them less careful in cultivating that inward purity and holiness of mind; and in practising those duties of religion, which are required of every Christian. The committee, charged with revising those offices, thought it necessary to lop those excrescences, and to retrench those clogs on ra∣tional devotion and true religion; but took care, at the same time, to preserve a number of innocent cere∣monies, consistent with the simplicity of the Christian religion, and sufficient to maintain the decency and order necessary to be observed in public worship.— The two guides, which they followed in compiling the English liturgy, were, the pure religion taught in
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>scripture, and the usages of the primitive church: and it seems to have been their chief view, to make the worship of the church of England such, as all Chris∣tians upon earth might lawfully join in, whilst it af∣forded all the necessary means of salvation to her own members. All acts of communion are so many exer∣cises of union: and, as they judged an unity of com∣munion necessary to the unity of the Catholic church, they were likewise sensible of this truth, that whatever church, whether diocesan, provincial or national, how widely soever extended over several nations, or con∣tracted within the bounds of one particular country, doth, by introducing unlawful terms of communion, unlawful prayers or practices, into her constant wor∣ship, render communion with herself impracticable, she doth, at the same time, destroy the unity of com∣munion, and cut off herself from the body of the Catholic church. This may be termed a <HI>moral</HI> sepa∣ration from the church of Christ: and takes place whether it be followed by a <HI>local</HI> one or not, it being inconsistent with the duty of a good Christian to join in unlawful petitions or practices, or to communicate with a body of men, how numerous soever, a part of whose constant worship is unlawful. Actual commu∣nion can only be exercised with the particular churches, within whose bounds or neighbourhood we either live or sojourn: but it is necessary for every particular church to be in a state of communion with all the Christian world; which she cannot be if she vitiates her constant worship by unlawful prayers or practices, and thus hinders all sincere Christians from joining in her worship. From these principles it is easy to see, why the committee, in drawing up the liturgy, left out the practices of adoring, as well the wood of the cross, as the host in the form of a wafer, and the prayers either directly addressed to the Blessed Virgin, St. Nicholas, and other saints, or suing for the par∣don of sins, the benefit of the sacraments, and eternal
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>salvation, by their intercession and merits; which are to be seen in the <HI>sarum</HI> or other missals, used at that time, though they had no place in the antient liturgies of the church of England before the conquest, as ap∣pears from the <HI>benedictionale</HI> and <HI>breviary</HI> given by Ro∣bert Archbishop of Canterbury to the chapter of Rouen and the abbey of Jumieges. Solitary masses were abolished; the communion in the sacrament, and the administration thereof in both kinds, were restored, according to the institution of our Saviour, and the practice of the primitive church, that the people might not be deprived of any means of grace, or condition of salvation, offered to them under the gospel oeconomy. That they might not be diverted from having recourse to those means; or from a care of working out their salvation with a religious fear, by human inventions, and a groundless notion of their being attended with salutary and supernatural effects, all exorcisms and be∣nedictions of salt and water, fire, coals, candles, bran∣ches of trees, bells<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 234 &amp; seq. of vol. i. of this work.</NOTE>, and the like inanimate sub∣stances, and other superstitious usages, debasing the dignity of religion, and inconsistent with that beauty of holiness, in which God is to be worshipped, were laid aside<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">The new liturgy enjoined by act of parliament, called the act of uniformity.</NOTE> The new liturgy being drawn up, was subscribed by all the members of the committee, except Day Bishop of Chi∣chester: and being approved by the con∣vocation, had afterwards the sanction of a law given to it by the parliament, which met on Saturday November 24, and "enjoined all the clergy in cathedrals and parish-churches, from the Whitsuntide next following, to say and use the matins, even-song, ad∣ministration of the sacraments, and all other common and open prayer, in such order and form as was set down

<PB N="96" REF="99"/>labours would be more serviceable to religion in that way, than in any other, did not care, in the decline of life, to charge himself with the care of a diocese. The bill for allowing the marriage of the clergy, which had been frustrated by the prorogation of the parliament, December 24, 1547, being now revived, it was en∣acted, "that all positive laws, canons, constitutions, and ordinances, formerly made, and prohibiting mar∣riage to any ecclesiastical or spiritual person, of what degree soever, should be utterly void, and of none ef∣fect; and that all manner of forfeitures, penalties, crimes, or actions, in consequence of such laws, should be likewise void, as well with regard to the marriages already made, as those that hereafter should be made, by such ecclesiastical persons." When this bill passed the house of Lords, seven Bishops, with the Lords Morley, Dacres, Windsor, and Wharton, entered their dissent. The act enjoining <HI>abstinence</HI> from flesh in Lent, and on Fridays, Satudays, ember-days, vigils, and other usual fish or fasting days, not abrogated, pas∣sed unanimously: and that for vacating all fraudulent and extorted sales of the pensions, granted to priests on the dissolution of convents and chantries, and re∣storing them to the rightful proprietors upon refunding the inconsiderable purchase-money, seems to have met with no opposition. The beneficed clergy suffered great hardships at this time; abundance of patrons seizing the revenues of churches for their own use, or potting in the religious (who had pensions out of the abbey-lands which they had purchased) to serve the cures; the people in general refusing to pay <HI>tythes,</HI> either out of a dislike of the incumbent, or because they found that the patrimony of the church might, in so unsettled a time, be securely invaded<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The loss which the clergy sustained by their rights and the ec∣clesiastical laws, which should have secured them, lying dormant for years together, was the greater, by its happening at a time when the rents of lands were rising continually upon the suppression of abbeys, and the yearly flows of gold and silver from America, so that incum∣bents were glad to take what they could get from the Lords and landholders in their parishes; not daring to demand more, lest they should lose all. This gave occasion to a multitude of compositions for tythes; which, if continued at the same rate for the time of se∣veral incumbents, and, in some cases, even of one, if long-lived, and non-resident, serve for a pretence to country juries to fix them for ever, under the notion of a <HI>modus.</HI> The malevolence of lawyers, a variation in the maxims of law, and the want of settled rules for evidence, have contributed much to this grievance. The mistaken names given by country people of late to some parcels of land, have been the occasion perhaps of a hundred churches losing their rights since the Revolution. When churches were built, and parishes an∣nexed to them, they were endowed by the Bishop's giving the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and small tythes of the district to the Rector of the church, and by the Lord of the manor's giving a manse and glebe. This glebe was assigned in small doles or pieces, taken from the lands occupied by each of his tenants, and these lie dispersed in the common fields or meadows, till they come, upon an enclosure, to be laid together, for the common convenience of the Rector and his parishioners. These small portions of glebe, are, in old terriers, called <HI>doles,</HI> or pieces; but, within this l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st century, the common people have got an habit of calling, such as lie in meadow ground, <HI>tythe pieces;</HI> and from hence pretend, that they were given in lieu of tythe hay, either of the meadows wherein they lie, or of the whole parish: though it is p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain, no part of the glebe given by a Lord of the manor, could be a composition for any part of the tythes given by the Bishop. The old terriers before Archbishop Laud's time, contained only accounts of the glebe; and whoever consults these, will find almost all the pieces, now called tythe pieces, to be there called only pieces, and described as parts of the glebe, with all their respective boundaries and quantities, so that there can be no room for doubt.</NOTE>. To

<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Lord Sudley attainted and beheaded.</NOTE> Thomas Lord Sudley had, in the be∣ginning of the year, renewed his intrigues against his brother the Lord Protector, by forming confederacies with such noble∣men as envied the Protector's greatness; arraigning the Protector's conduct, and charging him with a de∣sign of enslaving the nation, by the help of 3000 Ger∣man soldiers, who had been taken into pay, and brought over to serve against Scotland. He per∣suaded the noblemen to retire home, and make them∣selves strong in their countries; and courted the yeomen, and such as were ringleaders in counties, and retained abundance of these, as well as of young gentlemen, in his service. In consequence of these measures, he thought himself sure of raising 10,000 men, at any time, besides his particular friends: and, having laid in magazines of arms for them (particularly in the castle of Holt, in Denbighshire) had found means to secure 10,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a month for their pay, by a combina∣tion with Sir W. Sharington, Vice-treasurer of the mint at Bristol. Sharington had defrauded the King above 4000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in clippings and shearings; and to make up the sum in his accounts, he had made the coin the lighter, and had coined a vast quantity of testons, of a base alloy, and under standard, without any warrant, and contrary to express orders. What he gained in this manner is computed to amount to 40,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Thus supplied with money, the Admiral grew confi∣dent of success; but wanted to be sure of another point, which, tho' no way serviceable to the getting the King in his hands, was perhaps necessary to his further de∣signs. The Queen dowager having died, in Septem∣ber 1548, in childbed, he renewed his addresses to the Princess Elizabeth, not without some hopes of their being accepted. Most of these proceedings were known; and the Protector had often warned him of
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>the danger he ran, endeavouring to dissuade him by gentle means from pursuing them: but he was incor∣rigible, and, when he could no longer excuse his mea∣sures, thought to bear himself our with insolence. No other method succeeding, it was resolved at last to send him and Sharington to the Tower: and the latter be∣ing tried, on February 4, at Guildhall, confessed his crimes, and was found guilty of high treason, but af∣terwards pardoned. The Protector still endeavoured to bring the Admiral to a submission; offering to stop all proceedings, if he would retire from court, and all public business: but nothing could cure his ambitious turbulent disposition, or moderate his hatred to his brother. This stubborness proved fatal to him▪ On February 25, a bill was brought into the house of Lords for his attainder; the King's council, and all the judges, having delivered their opinions, that se∣veral of the articles, charged against him, were trea∣son. The evidence for the bill being examined, it was agreed to unanimously; only the Protector, for natu∣ral pity's sake (such is the expression in the council books) desired leave to withdraw. The bill was read the third time, on the 27th, and sent down to the Commons, with a message, that, if they intended to follow the method taken in the upper house, the Lords, who had given their evidence there, should be sent to them, and declare, by word of mouth, before them such matters, as they might, in the mean time, see in their written depositions. The Commons resolved to pro∣ceed in the same manner, as had been observed by the Lords: but pressed that the Admiral might be brought to the bar, and plead for himself. The bill was read the second time, on Friday March I; and, on the Monday following, the Master of the Rolls bringing a message from the King, that "it was not necessary for the Admiral to appear before them, but, if the house required it, the Lords should attend to confirm their evidence;" it was read the third time, and passed

Upon a warrant, signed by the Protector and council, he was beheaded on March 20, upon Tower-hill; professing at his death, that he had never committed, or meant, any treason against the King or kingdom.</P>
<P>In the time of Henry VIII.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Joan Boacher burned.</NOTE> Protestants and Papists had been indiscriminately put to death, for the various reasons related in the preceding part of this work. The proceedings, in this reign, against Joan Boacher, an illiterate woman, gave an handle to the Roman Catholics to affirm, that the Reformers were not against burning, when the flames did not affect themselves. Joan was accused and convicted of maintaining the tenets of the Anabap∣tists (of whom there will be occasion to make mention afterwards) and that Christ was not really incarnate of the Virgin Mary; and condemned to be burned. Ed∣ward withstood all the solicitations of his council for signing the warrant for her execution, declaring, that it was doing in fact what they condemned in the church of Rome, and that he would not drive her head∣long to the Devil: but at last was persuaded by Arch∣bishop Cranmer, who urged, that Boacher's crime was an impeachment of the Apostles creed, and that blasphemers were to be stoned to death according to the Mosaic dispensation. The King, overcome by Cranmer's arguments and intreaties, put his hand to the bloody warrant, though not without seeming re∣luctance and visible tears, declaring, that he would lay all the charge upon the Archbishop before God. In the sequel, Geo. Van Parris, a Dutchman, was committed to the flames also, in Smithfield: and the Archbishop was more censured than his Ma∣jesty.</P>
<P>The new liturgy being printed and dispersed throughout the realm, upon the act of uniformity's
<PB N="101" REF="106"/>passing both houses,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Measures taken for en∣forcing the act of unifor∣mity.</NOTE> there appeared a greater and more general forwardness in receiving it, than could at first have been expected, before the common people were sufficiently weaned from their late usages. Some began, even at Easter, to officiate by it; and others followed their example, as fast as books could be provided: and, on Whitsunday, the day appointed by the act, it was read, with great so∣lemnity, in St. Paul's cathedral, at London, for an example to the churches of that city, and all over the kingdom. The learned men among the Roman Ca∣tholics did actually conform, seeing nothing in the liturgy to give offence, and not being able to shew, that there was the least necessity for retaining any of these usages in their former offices, which had been omitted: and the unlearned among them had reason enough to be pleased with the celebration of divine service, and having the principal mysteries of their re∣ligion communicated to them, in a language which they could understand. To ensure a general confor∣mity, and take away all the remains of superstition, a new <HI>royal visitation</HI> was made all over the kingdom; Archbishop Cranmer making one at the same time, and his delegates carrying with them the same injunc∣tions as the visitors. The principal points in these were, to prevent solitary masses being said in secret, or under the pretence of a communion; to banish some old ceremonies, as kissing the altar, breathing on the bread and chalice, and lifting them up openly before the distribution, still retained by some of the clergy; and to abolish the use of praying by beads, and saying; by an unreasonable preference, ten <HI>Ave Maria's</HI> for one <HI>Pater noster,</HI> which had come to be almost all the devotion of the vulgar. The visitors returned no com∣plaint from any part of the realm; only the Princess Mary continued the use of the mass in her own family The council exhorted her, by letters, to conform to
<PB N="102" REF="107"/>the laws, and not encourage others, by her disobedi∣ence, to a contempt of the king's authority. In her answer, on June 22, she told the council, "She did not consider the late acts as laws, being made in the King's nonage, and contrary to those of her father, which they were all bound to maintain:" and excused sending up her chaplain and comptroller, whom they had ordered to attend the board. A peremptory order be∣ing sent for their attendance, she wrote word to the council in another letter, dated June 27, "That she was subject to none of them, and would obey no laws they made, though she professed herself subject to the King." This occasioned a charge being given to her officers, who obeyed the summons, to represent to her, "That, tho' the King was young, his authority was, by the law of England, as great, as if he was of full age; that though, as single persons, they were her humble servants, yet, when they were assembled in a council, they acted in the King's name, and were to be equally respected in the exercise of his authority; that the late King's laws were no longer in force, others being made in their stead; and that, as all the King's subjects were included in the laws, without exception, she ought to set a good example." The Princess, ap∣prehensive of some further pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eedings, sent a person to the Emperor at Brussels, desiring him to interpose in her behalf, that she might not be forced to any thing against her conscience. Sir Philip Hobby was the ordinary resident at that court and Sir William Paget had been lately sent over, as ambassador extra∣ordinary, upon an overture, which that Prince had made to the Protector and council, for marrying her to Alphonso, brother to the King of Portugal. The Emperor insisted with Paget and Hobby, that the Princess should be allowed the free exercise of her re∣ligion: and they both engaged, in the King's name, that she should be dispensed with, <HI>for some time,</HI> in her
<PB N="103" REF="108"/>nonconformity; at which the Protector and council the more readily connived, on account of some distur∣bances at home.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Commotions in Devon∣shire, Nor∣folk, and o∣ther parts.</NOTE> Those Lords and gentlemen, who pos∣sessed the abbey-lands, had, many of them, inclosed large quantities of waste grounds in their manors, whereby the poor were deprived of the advantages they were ac∣customed to receive from the commoning they had enjoyed before: and wool, upon the increase of trade, turning to more profit than any thing pro∣duced by tillage, this humour of inclosing grew ge∣neral; whole villages were demolished, and houses pulled down to get quit of the inhabitants. The rents of farms were raised to three or four times their usual value; thousands of people were turned out of their way of livelihood; and this raising of rents enhanced excessively the price of provisions, which was the more grievous to the nation by the exportation of its good coin, and importing vast quantities of counterfeit money of a base alloy from abroad. A general spirit of discontent and mutiny arose from these grievances, among the common sort of people, all over the nation. Mr. Hales, one of the late commissioners for enquiring into inclosures, had observed every where the oppres∣sion of the poor country people; and, in the last session, had endeavoured to procure them some relief, by three different bills which he had brought into parlia∣ment: but, the intent of them appearing to those that were interested in the inclosures, they were all rejected by either the Lords or Commons. The King, who (as appears from one of his discourses) laid this matter to heart, in order to pacify the poor people, till be could more effectually redress their grievances, issued new commissions for enquiring into inclosures; and published a proclamation, in the beginning of May, enjoining all who had inclosed any lands, that used to be common, under certain penalties, to lay them open
<PB N="104" REF="109"/>again, by a day assigned. Whether this encouraged the populace to think they should be warranted in their proceedings, or whether they were apprehensive it would be eluded, and have as little effect as former proclamations, and even statutes, on the same account, they did not wait for the day fixed by it, but, rising in many parts of the realm in a riotous manner, pulled down the poles of parks, levelled banks, filled up ditches, and destroyed the hedges of inclosures. One of these risings, in Wiltshire, was suppressed by Sir W. Herbert; as those, in the adjacent counties of Gloucester and Oxford, were by the Lord Grey of Wilton, with the slaughter of a good many of the rioters. Those in Kent, Sussex, Hampshire, and some midland counties, were suppressed by gentler means; the nobility and gentry persuading the rioters to dis∣perse: but in Devonshire and Norfolk the commo∣tions were much more considerable and dangerous.—</P>
<P>That in <HI>Devonshire</HI> began upon the common pre∣tence of inclosures, and might as easily have been quelled, as any of the others, in which no body of figure had as yet appeared, if the insurgents had not been tampered with to change their note, and set up for the Romish religion. It was about Whitsunday (which fell this year on June 9) that the parish priest of Sampford Courtenay, grieving at the abolition of the mass, and the loss of his former gains by solitary ones, drew together a party of his parishioners, and, with some other confederates, persuaded the country people to take up arms, in hopes of increa∣sing their numbers, and drawing in the gentry to es∣peuse their quarrel. Nor were they deceived in their expectations; Humphrey Arundel, governor of St. Michael's Mount, and some other gentlemen, putting themselves at their head, their number soon amount∣ing to 10,000 men, united under expert commanders. It was expected at court, that this might be as easily suppressed as other risings: and the Lord Protector,
<PB N="105" REF="110"/>being averse to extremities, sent only the Lord Russel with a small force to stop their proceedings. This nobleman, too weak to encounter them in the open field, treated with them at a distance; hoping for the same suceess in this method, as the Duke of Norfolk, in the late reign, had met with, in disuniting the Yorkshire rebels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 462 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>: and, encouraging them to make their complaints, offered to send them to the council. Their demands were, "that the new liturgy should be laid aside, and the old service with the Latin mass, images, holy water, bread, and all other usual cere∣remonies, be restored; that the sacrament should be given only to the people at Easter, and in one kind; that it should be hung up, and worshipped, and all that refused to worship it should suffer as heretics; that solitary masses should be restored, and all preach∣ers in their sermons, and priests in the mass, should pray for souls in purgatory; that the English Bible should be called in, because otherwise the clergy could not easily confound heretics; that the act of the six articles should be revived, and Cardinal Pole be re∣stored and made of the King's council; and that half of the abbey and church lands be resumed, and given to two of the chief abbeys in each county; and that their particular grievances should be redressed in the manner which Mr. Arundel and the Mayors of Bod∣min should be sent, upon receipt of a safe-conduct, to represent." Their demands, which had been put into their heads by seditious priests, were rejected as inso∣lent: and an answer was drawn to each particular. In that, to the demand concerning the statute of the six articles, it was said, "that they would not have been carried in parliament, if the late King had not gone thither in person, and procured the act; though afterwards of his own accord he slackened the execu∣tion of it." As to the new liturgy, to which they had
<PB N="106" REF="111"/>declared an aversion, before they had either known or considered it, they were told, "it had been drawn up, after great study, and long consultation, by <HI>all the learned clergy,</HI> in reforming the old offices; and the worship of the church was now brought as near to what Christ and his Apostles had taught or done, as could be; it had been devised by the Bishops of the realm, had been agreed to by the whole clergy (in their provincial synods or convocation) established by parliament, and (being agreeable to scripture) was con∣firmed by the word of God himself."—A safe-conduct being refused to the ringleaders, who were treated as notorious traitors, and an answer shewing the unrea∣sonableness of every thing they demanded, could not be pleasing to the insurgents: however, they thought fit to moderate their demands, rather than put an end to the treaty. The mass, and the six articles, were now the chief matters insisted on; and these were rejected in the answer made, on July 8, in the King's name; whose minority being the most specious thing that misled them, it was represented to them, "that his blood, and not his years, gave him the crown, and the state of government required, that there should be, at all times, the same authority in Princes, and the same obedience in subjects." It was penned in a threaten∣ing stile, and concluded with ah<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>invitation of them to submit to the King's mercy, which the other insur∣gents had experienced, and found withal a redress of their grievances: otherwise they must expect the ut∣most severity that traitors deserved. The rebels, trusting to their numbers, were in no disposition to submit; and marched to Exeter, carrying before them the <HI>pix</HI> or <HI>hoste,</HI> born under a canopy, with crosses, banners, holy water and bread, candlesticks, and other things which had been removed out of churches for being abused to superstition. They laid siege to the town, and made several attempts to storm it, but in vain. Lord Russel, who had lain all this time at
<PB N="107" REF="112"/>Honiton, being joined by 300 Italian arquebusiers under Battista Spinola, by the Lord Grey with several troops of German horse, and other forces, resolved to attampt the relief of Exeter, which was now redu∣ced to extremity for want of provisions, the inhabi∣tants having been obliged to eat their horses. He attacked them, and driving them from their works, with a great slaughter of their men, entered the city on August 6, being received in a triumphant manner by the citizens, whose loyalty was rewarded by an increase of privileges, and a grant of the manor of Eviland to the corporation. The rebels, retiring in scattered parties, were pursued and cut off in great numbers; their strongest body, having rendezvouzed at Launceston, were routed, and their chiefs taken. Arundel, the mayor of Bodmin, and the rest of the ringleaders, were sent to London, and executed; several of the rabble were put to death by martial law, for a terror to others; and the vicar of Saint Thomas, one of the principal incendiaries, was hanged on the top of his own tower, dressed in his Popish garb, with his beads hanging at his girdle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Norfolk</HI> insurrection began at Ailborough June 20, and grew nothing considerable, till July 6, when Robert Ket a tanner, but rich, being owner of three manors, put himself at their head, and assumed the styles of master and King of Norfolk and Suffolk. He confined in irons all such as refused to follow his camp; and was supported by one Coniers, an ecclesias∣tic, who officiated as chaplain. They broke down in∣closures, ravaged the country, and denounced ven∣geance against the gentlemen of that county. The pretence of their rising at first only related to inclosures: but, when their number increased to 20,000, nothing would serve them but the suppression of the gentry, placing of new counsellors about the King, and some∣what to be done in favour of the old religion.

They rejected the offer with disdain, and established their head-quar∣ters at Munshold, where Ket the tanner, and a com∣mittee, sat in judgment under a large tree, known by the appellation of <HI>the oak reformation,</HI> from which Dr. Matthew Parker preached to the rebels of their duty and allegiance, to the no small hazard of his life from divers arrows snot at him. They made themselves masters of Norwich, and obliged Thomas Cod the Mayor to attend them, though at length they admitted him, and other gentlemen prisoners, to their councils, for the greater credit thereof. William Parr, Marquis of Northampton, was sent against them, and took posses∣sion of Norwich, which had been evacuated by the in∣surgents. These, assaulting the Marquis there in the night, were repulsed with a considerable loss; but re∣newed the attack with such impetuosity, that they en∣tered the city, and compelled Northampton to retreat, with the loss of one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dred men slain, among whom was John Lord S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d, and about thirty taken pri∣soners: for the citizens in general favoured the rebels, and annoyed the King's troops with stones from the windows and balconies, while they were engaged with the insurgents in the streets. Upon this disaster, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, was sent with a numerous reinforcement, and a large train of artillery. When he came before Norwich, he summoned the rebels to surrender, assuring them of the benefit of a free par∣don: but his proposal being rejected, he planted his artillery, and having made a breach, entered the city by assault. One hundred and thirty of the insurgents were killed in the encounter, and sixty, being taken, were immediately hanged by martial law: however some of Warwick's waggons falling into the hands of the rebels, they got a supply of ammunition, which they began to want. Their rage was increased at the
<PB N="119" REF="116"/>sight of the execution of their associates. They poured in like a torrent at one of the gates, though it was guarded with cannon, and, notwithstanding a very ob∣stinate resistance, carried off the artillery. On this occasion the very boys shewed a surprising spirit, pull∣ing the arrows from their bodies, and delivering them to their own archers. The insurgents, animated by this success, battered the wall, and then mounting the breach, were with great difficulty drove back. In∣fluenced by a supposed prophecy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The prophecy ran thus—
<P>The country knuffs, Hob, Dick, and Hick, with clubs and clouted shoon.</P>
<P>Shall fill up Dussendale with blood of slaughtered bodies soon.</P></NOTE>, they quitted the hill of Moushold, and taking possession of a low ground called Dussendale, sent a defiance to the Earl of Warwick. His lordship being reinforced with 1500 horse, sent them another offer of pardon, but with an exception of some of their ringleaders. The rebels refusing it on these terms, Warwick ordered the whole cavalry into the valley, where they were formed in tolerable good order, and had placed their prisoners in the front tied together in pairs, that they might stand the first brunt of the battle. The roya∣lists, however, spared the unfortunate captives, and attacked their antagonists with such vigour, that they quickly put them in disorder, and made them fly with precipitation. The pursuit was continued for three miles, with such carnage, that 2000 lay dead upon the ground. Those, who guarded the artillery and bag∣gage, had fortified themselves with waggons and palli∣sadoes, and declared that they would fight to the last drop of their blood: but upon assurance of pardon from Warwick's own mouth, laid down their arms, and submitted. Ket and his brother William being taken next day in a barn, the first was hanged on the walls of Norwich castle, and the latter on the top of Wymundham steeple. Nine others suffered in the same

<P>There was, about the same time, an insurrection of about 3000 persons in Yorkshire, excited by William Ombler, a man of some distinction, Thomas Dale a parish∣clerk, and one Stevenson, upon much the same pretences; but was quelled before it came to any great head, upon an offer of pardon; and the ringleaders, being taken, were executed with four of their followers, at York.</P>
<P>It was greatly suspected, that the Lady Mary, then residing at Kenninghall in Suffolk, had given encou∣ragement to the Norfolk rebellion: Pooley and Lionel, her servants, were said to have been concerned with them: but she vindicated herself very well from all suspicions, and the informations appeared to be groundless.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Bonner Bi∣shop of Lon∣don deprived and impri∣soned.</NOTE> The council now had leisure to look after the execution of the act of uniformity, from which they had been diverted by these commotions, and to take measures for preventing several Priests and Bishops, who had officiated openly by the new liturgy, to avoid the penalty, from celebrating their private masses in secret places, where it was difficult to discover their practices. This was done no where with such assurance, as in the cathedral of St. Paul; in several chapels whereof, by the sufferance of Edmund Bonner, the Bishop, masses were still kept up, particularly those of the Apostles and our Lady's performed in Latin, disguised under the English names of <HI>the Apostles,</HI> and <HI>our Lady's communion.</HI> The council had, by their letters of June 24, ordered Bonner not to suffer such masses to be used, or the holy communion to be administered, in any other place than at the high altar of the church, or at any other time than that when high mass used to be said formerly. Bonner, not willing himself to execute these injunctions, left it to the Dean and Chapter: and, the practice still continuing, he was
<PB N="111" REF="120"/>accused of negligence, and summoned to appear, on August 11, before the council. He had there a wri∣ting delivered to him in support of the charge of re∣missness, representing, that whereas on high festi∣vals he had used formerly to officiate himself, he had seldom or never done so, since the introduction of the new liturgy. Certain injunctions were given him, to be observed in his future conduct, and requiring him particularly to preach at St. Paul's cross once a quar∣ter, to be present there at every sermon, unless he were sick, to officiate in his cathedral on every high festival, and give the communion, to prosecute all that either went to mass, or did not frequent the common prayer, and receive the sacrament once a year. For a trial of his loyalty, he was ordered to preach at St. Paul's cross, on Sunday, September 1, against the rebels, and to shew as well the unlawfulness of taking up arms on pretence of religion, as that the King was as much a King, and the people as much bound to obey him, whilst a minor, as when he was of full age to take upon himself the exercise of government. When the day came he spent most of his sermon in maintaining transubstantiation, with many bitter reflec∣tions on all that were of a different opinion, and se∣veral other things tending to stir up disorder and dis∣sention: but mentioned nothing concerning the King's authority, whilst a monor, which, being necessary for refuting the chief pretence, as well of the rebels for their insurrections, as of others for their non-confor∣mity, had been mostly insisted upon by the council. This being complained of by Dr. William Latimer and John Hooper, a commission was issued, on Sep∣tember 8, to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Nicholas Ridley Bishop of Rochester, Sir W. Petre, and Sir T. Smith, secietaries of State, and Dr. W. May Dean of St. Paul's, to examine him upon the information given against him, and summarily to proceed to eccle∣siastical
<PB N="112" REF="121"/>censures, to imprisonment and deprivation, as the offence should be found to deserve. Bonner, when convened before them, pretended he could not see his judges, until they were pointed out to him by one of the bye-standers. When the witnesses were examined, he said one talked like a goose, and another like a woodcock. He treated the court with contempt, and laughed at the people, calling them fools and dunces. He affirmed, that Dr. Hooper was an ass indeed; and told Secretary Smith, that he was a liar. Archbishop Cranmer telling him, that he ought to be sent to prison for his insolence, he replied, that he cared not whi∣ther they sent him, so as they did not send him to the devil; but thither he said he would not go. He said, he had a few goods, a poor carcase, and a soul; that the two former were in their power, but the last was in his own. The court was several times adjourned: but he continuing to revile his judges in the most abu∣sive terms, was committed to the Marshalsea, after having appealed to the King. Whilst in that prison, he was assured of gentle usage, if he would submit, and promise better behaviour for the future: but he seems to have taken his party, and, insisting on his appeal to the King, which was either not received, or he could not obtain a supersedeas upon it, refused to make any other answer. He had taken out a com∣mission to hold his see of London, during the King's pleasure; and the Commissioners, though unwilling to proceed to extremities, seeing him obstinate and in∣corrigible, sentenced him to be deprived of his see, and to remain in prison till the King should order other∣wise. This method of procedure against Bonner, and the exemplary punishment of the late rebels, being followed by an act in the next session of parliament, for the destroying of all images, and the calling in of all the old offices, kept the Romanists in tolerable order during the remainder of Edward's reign.</P>
<PB N="113" REF="122"/>
<P>The measures, which the Protector had taken to promote the reformation,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Protector accused of mal∣administration, sent to the Tower, and releasea.</NOTE> had made all the Popish party his enemies: and having too precipitately raised an im∣mense fortune, gave too much occasion for a clamour against his conduct. Besides the deanery of Wells, with five other dignities or prebends, which Henry VIII. had promised him, and the church-lands bestowed upon him, by Edward VI. as a reward for his success in Scotland, he had procured a great many other beneficial grants to himself, to the impairing of the King's revenue. He had recommended his ser∣vants to the like bounties, and had been so partial to his own creatures in the distribution of the chantry lands, that a very small portion of them was granted to such noblemen as he viewed in an unfavourable light. The prosecution of his brother, (in which he was sup∣posed to act by Warwick's instigation) and the signing of the warrant for his execution, appeared in the world's eye such unnatural acts, that they greatly ble∣mished his character. The parade he shewed of his wealth, in erecting that sumptuous palace called <HI>So∣merset house,</HI> and the havock he made of the sacred buildings on that occasion gave universal offence. West∣minster-abbey was first proposed for the scite of his palace; but he was diverted from that design, by the Dean and Chapter conveying to him the rich manor of Islip, and a great many others, for ninety years. When he had fixed upon <HI>the Strand</HI> for its situation, St. Mary's parish church, and the contiguous houses of the Bishops of Worcester, Litchfield, and Landaff, were pulled down to furnish ground and materials for the structure; and there being still deficiency in the latter respect, a chapel in St. Paul's church-yard, a charnel house there, with a chapel in it, and a goodly cloister about it, the steeple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note, page 20 of this volume.</NOTE> and a part of the church
<PB N="114" REF="123"/>of St. John of Jerusalem, were likewise demolished, to supply stone, iron, lead, and timber for that purpose. The tombs and monuments of the dead were defaced, and their bones carried away by cart-loads, and buried in Bloomsbury fields: this was shocking to every body, and gave the Londoners a dislike to the Protector. Probably his natural compassion for the poor, and his sense of their hardships, made him erect a court of re∣quests in his own house for their relief, and interpose with the judges in their behalf: but he carried his re∣gard for them to extremity, when he courted their favour, when his condescension to them sunk so low as to encourage them to contemn and disobey his commands, when his preference of them was so appa∣rent, as to raise the jealousy and indignation of the nobility. These last were enraged, to the highest de∣gree, at the insults and losses they had sustained in the late commotions; imputing the rise of them to the commissions and proclamations against enclosures issued by his authority or influence, and the not suppressing them in the bud to his dilatory proceedings, and de∣clining to march against them in person at the head of an army. Their resentments on these accounts were now at the height; and the party against the Protector thought the juncture favourable to their design.— After several complaints, disputes, and treaties for an accommodation, the Lord St. John, President, the Earls of Warwick, Arundel, and Southampton, Sir E. North, Sir Richard Southwell, Sir Edward Peckham, Sir E. Wotton, and Doctor Nicholas Wotton, met, on Sunday, October 6, at Ely House in Holborn, where Warwick resided; and, taking upon them to act as the King's council, sent for the Mayor and Aldermen of London, and, after arraigning the Protector's conduct, in every point, for which they had the least pretence, required them to obey no letters sent by him, but only such as came from themselves. The Lieu∣tenant of the Tower, being likewise sent for, submitted
<PB N="115" REF="124"/>to their orders: and they were joined, next day, by the Lord Chancell or Rich, the Marquis of Northamp∣ton, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Sir T. Cheyne, Sir John Gage, Sir Ralph Sadler, and the Lord Chief Justice Montague: and wrote the King a letter full of pro∣fessions of their duty, pretences of zeal for his preser∣vation, and complaints against the Duke of Somerset, whom they charged with gathering a force about him, to maintain his wilful measures. This charge was founded on his behaviour at Hampton court, upon advice of what was doing at Ely-house; having caused a proclamation to be made at the court-gates, and in other parts of the neigbourhood, requiring all persons to come in for the defence of the King; whom he re∣moved thence that night to Windsor castle, with his guards, and the retinues of such as were then at court, making in all about 500 men. The Lords at Lon∣don went to Guildhall, October 8, and, giving the common council of the city an account of their pro∣ceedings, assured them, they had no thoughts of alter∣ing religion, as was reported by their enemies, and no views but for the safety of the King, the honour of the kingdom, and the good of the people; for which ends they desired their assistance. The common coun∣cil unanimiously approved of their conduct, and pro∣mised to stand by them with their lives and fortunes. This declaration of theirs, and the commons not com∣ing in as he expected to his assistance, so intimidated the Protector, that he resolved to struggle no longer against the stream: and, protesting that his design in collecting forces was only to guard his person from any violent attack, declared himself ready to submit to what two of the Lords at London, and two of those about the King, should determine; desiring, however, that what was agreed on, should be confirmed in par∣liament. A warrant was sent for the two Lords to repair to Windsor, with the King's faith for their safe∣ty: and Cranmer, Paget, and Smith (all the coun∣sellors
<PB N="116" REF="125"/>now remaining with him) wrote to them, re∣commending a peaceable determination of the matter, and exhorting them not to be led by cruel councils, which they well knew some were suggesting; glancing at the Earl of Southampton, who had not yet digested the disgrace brought on him by the Duke of Somer∣set.— The Lords Russel and Wentworth, Sir Ant. Brown, Sir Ant. Wingfield, and Sir John Baker Speaker of the House of Commons, having deserted the Duke of Somerset in his distress, and joined the associate counsellors at London, it was agreed that So∣merset was no longer fit to be Protector. Sir Philip Hobby was sent back with letters to the King, desiring they might be admitted to his presence; that the forces gathered about his person might be sent away; and that the Duke of Somerset might submit himself to the order of council. Their desires were complied with: and the Lords, being invited to send three persons to Windsor, for ordering things according to their minds, sent them, with a charge not to allow the Duke of Somerset to withdraw before their arrival. On October 12, the whole council came to Windsor, protesting to the King, that all they had done was for his safety and service. On the day following, the Protector, being called before them, was charged with several misdemeanors, "in acting without the consent of the other executors; in treating alone with foreign ambassadors; in making Bishops and Lord Lieutenants by his own authority; in holding a court of requests in his own house, and determining matters relating to freeholds; in embasing the coin; in issuing procla∣mations and commissions about inclosures, contrary to the sentiments of the rest of the council; in not taking care to suppress the late insurrections, in ne∣glecting the forts about Boulogne; in possessing the King with ill notions of the designs of the Lords, who met at London, and causing them to be proclaimed as traitors; in arming his servants, gathering people,
<PB N="117" REF="126"/>carrying the King to Windsor so suddenly, as to put him in fear, and threw him into a dangerous disease." In consequence of this charge, he was sent to the Tower, and the King was carried back the same day to Hampton Court; the Marquis of Northampton, the Earls of Warwick and Southampton, the Lords St. John, Russel, and Wentworth, being appointed gover∣nors of his person.</P>
<P>Thus matters stood, when the parliament met on No∣vember 4, after which a bill of attainder was brought into the house of Peers against the Duke of Somerset, founded upon a confession signed with his own hand. A deputation of that august assembly was sent to learn from his own mouth, whether this confession was vo∣luntary or extorted. He thanked them for their can∣dour; owned that he had voluntarily signed the writing; but solemnly protested, that he had never harboured a sinister thought against his Sovereign or the state. Upon this he was divested of all his offices; and all his moveables, together with great part of his landed estate, were confiscated, for the use of the King; but his submissive behaviour, and the frivolous∣ness of the charge against him, so far blunted the ma∣lice of Warwick and his other enemies, that the pro∣secution was dropped, and himself released from his confinement, after giving security for his future con∣duct, and, in two months after his enlargement, re∣admitted to a seat at the council table.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the parliament passed a severe law against unlawful assemblies,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Acts in fa∣vour of the Reformation.</NOTE> in order to prevent future insurrections; and repealed the statute against vaga∣bonds, which had passed in the parliament that met in November 1547, and was enacted chiefly against the religious of dissolved monasteries. The new liturgy was confirmed in this session; and all the <HI>old offices, missals,</HI> and <HI>breviaries,</HI> with other books deemed su∣perstitious, were ordered to be delivered to certain com∣missioners,
<PB N="118" REF="127"/>that they might be burned and destroyed. It was enacted, that all the prayers addressed to saints should be razed out of the books printed in the late reign; and that all images taken from churches should, within a limited time, be committed to the flames. These laws prevented all further opposition, from the Romish party, to the new liturgy, during this King's reign, as the want of service-books rendered their priests incapable to officiate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was in this session that the sons of Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s first obtained liberty to sit in the house of Commons.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The friends of Popery, expecting that the Earl of Southampton would now have the reins of govern∣ment, were much elated at the fall of Somerset: but they soon found that the Earl of Warwick had the ascendancy. They were not destitute of hopes from this nobleman, who was generally believed to have given them great hopes and assurances of what he would do in their favour: but, when he found the King immoveable in that point, and so much bent upon the reformation, that nothing could so much recom∣mend a person to his favour, as endeavouring to pro∣mote it, he easily dropped that party, and affected to be zealous in advancing what he found was so agree∣able to his Sovereign. Bonner petitioning that his appeal might be received, and his process reviewed, a new court of delegates, consisting of four civilians, and the like number of common lawyers, was appoint∣ed for that purpose: but, upon examining the mat∣ter, they reported, that the process had been legally carried on, and the sentence justly given.</P>
<P>There still were wanting, to compleat the offices of the church of England,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A newordinal established.</NOTE> forms of prayer for the consecration of Bishops, and the ordination of priests and deacons: and the par∣liament passed an act for authorising by law an ordi∣nal, to be drawn up by six Bishops, and as many learn∣ed
<PB N="119" REF="128"/>divines, of the King's appointment, and published by the next April 1, prohibiting, after that day, the use of any other. The council already had, at the in∣stance of the convocation, set the committee (formerly appointed by that body for reforming the <HI>old offices</HI>) which had drawn up the <HI>new liturgy,</HI> to work upon this ordinal; though, it not being yet compleated, the parliament thought sit to give it a legal sanction, by a previous confirmation; so implicitly did they pay a deference to the resolutions of the clergy. The or∣dinations, mentioned in scripture, were performed by the imposition of hands, and prayer, and the ancientest forms of ordaining were plain and simple: but latter ages had introduced, in different countries, unctions of the persons ordained, consecration of vestments, and abundance of other rites and ceremonies, which, being unknown in the first ages of the gospel, the committee thought fit to retrench; and to sollow the rules of the primitive church, as recapitulated in the fourth council of Carthage in 401; which, though composed only of African Bishops, was generally followed, as to the form of consecrating Bishops and inferior ministers, in all the western churches. The Romanists, from the time of the council of Florence, in the fifteenth cen∣tury, laid a mighty stress upon the rite of delivering to a priest the vessels used in the consecration of the eucharist, with a power of sacrificing to God for the dead and the living; a form introduced to countenance solitary masses, and the notion, which they were wil∣ling to encourage, of a new offering up of our Savi∣our, distinct from that on the cross. When the church in her ordinal hath sufficiently expressed the holy order, to which a person is called, and the Bishops, minister∣ing in her behalf, have actually, by imposition of hands, and prayer, conferred upon him that order, though in general terms, he is, in consequence thereof, invested with all the powers annexed by Christ to that order; nor is there any occasion for an enumeration of every
<PB N="120" REF="129"/>particular power or branch of his office. There is no necessary connexion between a priest and a sacrifice: yet the church of England, having empowered such, as she admits to the order of a priest or presbyter, to administer the sacraments, has empowered them there∣by to offer the eucharistical sacrifice. This she thinks as true a sacrifice, as the passover, or any other of the Jewish sacrifices under the law: it is commemorative, as they were typical, of our Saviour's sacrisice of him∣self upon the cross: both are representative thereof, though in a different manner, and derive thence their salutary effects. She considers it as a sacrifice really propitiatory, not indeed in its own nature, but in vir∣tue of Christ's institution, as it is a memorial of his own sacrifice upon the cross, and a means of applying, to each good Christian in particular, all the benefits, which he purchased by it for the church in general. If her adversaries think fit to represent it, as propitia∣tory in its own nature, as a new meritorious satisfaction to God for the sins of the living and the dead, as a suppletory sacrifice continually supplying the defects of our Saviour's sacrifice, or as a new immolation of him, or renewal of his passion, she rejects all these as false and unprimitive notions: and, however they may be insinuated in private to gull the common people, it is not easy to imagine, that any learned man will dare to maintain them openly and explicitly. The new ordi∣nal was published in the March following: and the first Bishop consecrated by it was John Poynet, promoted to the see of Rochester.</P>
<P>A. D. 1550.] In the beginning of this year, a peace being concluded with France and Scot∣land,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Gardiner de∣frived of his sie of Win∣dester.</NOTE> the council was more at leisure, and better enabled to remove all obstructions, that retarded a further reformation. The principal of these arose from some papisti∣cal Bishops; who, complying with all alterations when made, still kept their sees, and, receiving with
<PB N="121" REF="130"/>respect the orders sent them from time to time, took little or no care for their execution; encouraging un∣derhand the retaining of many superstitious and abo∣lished practices, to which they were themselves ad∣dicted. It was resolved to contrive some way or bring∣ing them within the reach of the law; and, by putting tests upon them, which they could not easily en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, oblige them either to declare their dislike of what had been lately established, or to oppose the royal autho∣rity; acts, which, in the precarious tenure they had of their sees, <HI>during the King's pleasure,</HI> were deemed suf∣ficient causes for their deprivation. Bonner had been already deprived; and Ridley was, on April 1, trans∣lated to the see of London; Middlesex (which had been taken thence, as before related, to farm the dio∣cese of Westminster<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 30 of this volume.</NOTE>) being at the same time reunited to it, upon Thirlby's resignation of the latter bishopric, and removal to Norwich. Gardiner, Bishop of Win∣chester, had made so ill an use of the liberty he en∣joyed, in consequence of the act of grace, passed at the latter end of the year 1547, that he was, in a short time afterwards, summoned before the council, and ordered to preach, on June 29, at St. Paul's Cross, pursuant to the directions given him, by way of pur∣gation: deviating from his instructions in that sermon, he had been put in prison, where he had continued till this year; when, on June 8, his case being considered in council, it was resolved, "that, if he repented of his former obstinacy, and would for the future apply himself to advance the King's proceedings, his past errors should be remitted; otherwise he should be pro∣secuted as his obstinacy and contempt deserved." This resolution being communicated to him next day, he de∣sired to see a book of the King's proceedings; and then, expressing an inclination to conform, promised to give a full and direct answer, even on subjects which
<PB N="122" REF="131"/>might offend his conscience. A book was thereupon sent him; and, Dr. Heylin says, "that, after peru∣sing all the offices contained in the Common-Prayer-book, he declared, that he was very well satisfied in his conscience with it, and would not only execute it in his own person, but cause all of his diocese to officiate by it in divine service." As to other proceedings, he excused himself from answering them, unless he were at liberty. The council, not being satisfied with this, sent some certain articles to him, on July 8, which he was required to subscribe. He excepted to none of them, but that which concerned the confession of his faults, and the submission he was to make to the King for pardon; which he utterly rejected, insisting upon his innocence. Though displeased at his refusal, the King was unwilling to treat him with rigour, and sent W. Herbert and Secretary Petre to acquaint him, that, if the words of the confession proposed seemed too harsh, he might devise others, provided he made a submission. He refusing to modify them, and stand∣ing peremptorily on his justification, new articles, and a new submission, were drawn up for him to subscribe; the former containing the most material steps taken in the reformation, of which he was to express his ap∣probation, and declare himself willing to vindicate them in the pulpit. When they were brought him, he positively refused to make a submission: and, as for the other articles, he would not declare his opinion, till he should be set at liberty; it not being reasonable he should subscribe them in prison. It was hereupon resolved, to send for him before the council, and exa∣mine him whether he would stand to that answer; and, in case he did, to denounce a sequestration of his tem∣poralities for three months, with intimation, that, if he did not comply in that time, he should be deprived. This was done on July 19; and, when the articles were read to him, he refused either to subscribe or consent; professing himself desirous to obey the King, in all his
<PB N="123" REF="132"/>lawful commands; but as several things were desired of him against his conscience, he desired to be excused. The sequestration was then read: and, though it ex∣pired on October 19, nothing was attempted against him till November 23, when a committee was appoint∣ed, by the council, to consider of the legal steps ne∣cessary to be taken in order for his deprivation. A commission was issued, on December 12, to Archbishop Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley Bishop of London, Tho∣mas Goodrich Bishop of Ely, Henry Holbech Bishop of Lincoln, Sir William Petre, Sir James Hales, and other lawyers, directing them to call the Bishop of Winchester before them, and proceed to deprive him, if he continued in his obstinacy. His trial beginning on the 15th, he desired a copy of the commission, and the articles exhibited against him, which accordingly were allowed him: and entered a protest against his judges, as being prejudiced against him; excepting, for the same reason, against Sir Anthony Wingfield, Sir William Cecil, Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Edward North, and other persons of rank, that were examined as wit∣nesses. He was allowed to choose his own council, and had the liberty of producing several of the King's council, as witnesses, in his behalf. Gardiner was so well versed in all the dilatory pleas and quirks of the civil and canon laws, that his trial took up twenty-two sessions: but his manifest contempt, and continued disobedience, of the King's orders, and the laws made for establishing the reformation, being fully proved, sentence was at last, on February 14 next following, pronounced against him, declaring him deprived, and his see vacant. He hoped to prevent its execution, by appealing from it, as unjust and invalid, to the King: but the commissioners would not receive it, till they first knew his Majesty's pleasure. During the course of his trial, he had behaved himself with so much irre∣verence to the King, with such calumnious reflections on the council, and with such insolence to his judges,
<PB N="124" REF="133"/>calling them Heretics and Sacramentarians, that he had no reason to expect such a favour: and on this ac∣count an order was made the next day in council, for removing him to a meaner lodging in the Tower, with only one servant about him, to be appointed by the Lieutenant, and for debarring him of all visits and correspondence, as well as the use of pen, ink, and paper.</P>
<P>Whilst the council was stripping such of their power as were avowed enemies of the reforma∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Peter Martyr, and other fo∣reigners, ar∣rive in Eng∣land.</NOTE> they found its progress obstructed, and even its settlement attacked in certain particular points, by some, who pretend∣ed to be the most zealous for it in the main, and by whom they expected it would be best promoted. When the Emperor Charles V. had crushed the Smalcalde league, taken John Frederic Elector of Saxony at Mulberg, and, by a scandalous prevarication, got Philip Landgrave of Hesse into his hands, he thought himself absolute master of Germany: and, no body daring to oppose his will, he had got an edict passed in a diet, for regu∣lating the exercise of religion throughout the empire, agreeable to his own notions of things, but in such a manner as did not please many of the Romanists, and was generally detested by the Protestants. This edict was called the <HI>interim,</HI> because it was only to take place till the council of Trent should have determined by its decisions all matters relating to religion, and all disputed points, either of faith or ecclesiastical disci∣pline: and it was ensorced by the severest penalties, in case of non-compliance. The divines of the Pro∣testant churches, being the chief objects of the Emperor's indignation, were forced, in 1548, to abscond for the safety of their lives. In this distress, Archbishop Cranmer got from the King a pension of forty marks a-year, for Peter Martyr Vermiglio, a learned Floren∣tine, settled at Strasburgh: and invited him over to
<PB N="125" REF="134"/>England; where, after entertaining him some time in his own house, he procured him a canonry of Christ∣church, and the chair of divinity professor in the uni∣versity of Oxford. In the year following, he did the same service for Martin Bucer, and Paul Fagius; getting each of them pensions of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year: the latter was appointed Hebrew lecturer at Cambridge, but died in a few weeks; and the former, being made professor there, performed the functions of his charge with excellent abilities and an unwearied application, to the general satisfaction, and the great advantage, of the university.</P>
<P>The universities were at this time in no little distress, not being sufficiently endowed,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proposed vi∣sitation of the two universi∣ties.</NOTE> and abun∣dance of students being forced to leave them for want of subsistence. The King indeed sent them relief from time to time, and maintained professors for their instruc∣tion: but the avarice of his courtiers rendered the little they enjoyed very precarious, and was a great discouragement to the progress of their studies. Com∣missions had been issued for a visitation of both these seminaries, under pretence of removing all remains of superstition, with such as maintained them; but the visitors were empowered likewise to unite two colleges into one, by which the suppression of one of them would of course be effected, and the courtiers have an opportunity of procuring grants of its revenues. This advantage they commonly made upon all alterations: and it was the true meaning of those exchanges, which were made of lands, upon the vacancy of sees, between the King and the new Bishops. Thus, when Ridley was translated to London, the manors of Braintree, Southminster, Hackney, and Stepney, with the Marsh, were exchanged for other lands, and some impropria∣tions of the same or a better value, so that the crown had no advantage by the bargain: yet those manors
<PB N="126" REF="135"/>were no sooner in the King's hands, than Lord Rich obtained a grant of the first, Sir Thomas Darcy of the second, and the Lord Wentworth of the two last of those manors. Ridley, one of the visitors for Cambridge, when he found how far their commissions extended, easily saw through the design; and, refusing to act in it, put a stop to its execution; probably defeating, at the same time, the other intended for Oxford.</P>
<P>The before-mentioned foreign professors had been continually engaged in disputations concerning the controverted points of religion; particularly the mass and transubstantiation, which the Roman Catholics con∣sidered as the most essential articles of their faith, and in which, for that reason, they were allowed a full li∣berty of arguing and defending their sentiments. Bucer died on February 28, 1551; and Peter Martyr sur∣vived King Edward; having both acquitted themselves, on all occasions, answerably to the high opinion enter∣tained of their learning, before their arrival in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>Much about the time they arrived in England, there also came over other foreigners,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Account of John a Lasco, and his fol∣lowers.</NOTE> who, in∣stead of shewing a grateful sense of the charitable reception and generous encou∣ragement they met with here, made it their business to find fault with the rules and ordinances compiled for the reformation of religion, in trisling matters, since they could do it in nothing momentous, and to promote a disaffection and non∣conformity in things and circumstances, owned to be in their nature indifferent. In the infancy of a refor∣mation, nothing could be of more pernicious conse∣quence, or more likely to prevent its succeeding, than such a non-conformity and division among its profes∣sors, as had appeared some years before, and was now evident in Germany, from the division between the Lutherans, Zuinglians, and Calvinists, about the sa∣crament:
<PB N="127" REF="136"/>yet such was the conduct of John a Lasco, a Polish Baron, who came over with a great number of German and other foreign refugees, to whom he served as chief pastor. He was settled with this congrega∣tion at Embden in East Friesland, when the appre∣hension of being persecuted there made him come over to England, to stipulate for a secure retreat, and com∣petent provision, for himself and flock; assuring the Duke of Somerset, that it would be the means of in∣troducing a new trade, and gainful manufacture, into the kingdom. He desired, that they might be incor∣porated by the King's letters-patent, with certain pri∣vileges; and that some old dissolved church or mona∣stery might be assigned them for a place of divine wor∣ship: and obtained a pension of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, with a patent of naturalization for himself, his wife and chil∣dren. A charter was likewise passed, on July 24, con∣stituting these German refugees a body politic, under the direction of John a Lasco, their superintendant, and four other ministers, with a power to increase their number, and choose their successors, if the King approved the choice. The church of the Au∣gustine Friars, with its soil, scite, and appurtenances in London, was also granted them, for holding their religious assemblies, and they were authorised to use their own rites and ceremonies in the worship of God, and to exercise their own ecclesiastical discipline, though they differed from the government and forms of worship established in the church of England.</P>
<P>Upon this encouragement, and the privileges of na∣turalization enabling them to trade with the same freedom and advantages as the natives, a great num∣ber of Germans, Poles, and other foreigners, came over to London: and settled in different parts of the city, though the greatest part of them chose St. Ca∣therine's and Southwark for their residence. Another church of strangers, mostly Walloons and French,
<PB N="128" REF="137"/>settled, at the same time, in Glastenbury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 472 of vol. ii. and page 8 of this vol.</NOTE>, under the protection of the Duke of Somerset; who had, for their accommodation, procured from the crown a grant fo the scite and demeasnes of that dissolved abbey, in exchange for the castle and manor of Sleford in Lincolnshire. These, being weavers and workers in kerseys, and the like cloths, served to introduce that manufacture into the country. A French congrega∣tion, and another of Italians, were likewise set up in London, subject to John a Lasco's inspection; whose jurisdiction or superintendency extended over all churches of foreigners in that city, and over their schools of learning or education. It was an impolitic thing in the Council and Bishops, whilst they were pressing an uniformity in divine worship, and disci∣pline, throughout the nation, to allow these churches in its metropolis to exist under another kind of govern∣ment, and to use a different liturgy (viz. that of Stras∣bourgh) with different rites and ceremonies from those enjoined by the laws: it proved an obstruction to the settlement of order in the church of England, and gave occasion to a good deal of disturbance in eccle∣siastical proceedings. Their conduct in this point was probably owing to their compassion for strangers, persecuted and denied the exercise of their religion in their own country: but there seems to have been an∣other reason for putting all these foreign congregations under the superintendency of John a Lasco; by whose care and vigilance it was hoped, that a stop might be put to the resort of Anabaptists from 2broad, and that, with whatever privacy they came over, they might be discovered foon after their arrival.</P>
<P>Several of these Anabaptists had come into England,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Anabaptism propagated in England by Popish emisa∣ries.</NOTE> during the reign of Henry VIII. but this Prince took such strict measures in finding them out, and punished with such severity, burning all who did
<PB N="129" REF="138"/>not abjure their tenets, that they were soon obliged to return into their own countries<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They consisted of two sects,

<ITEM>1. Such as held that baptism ought not to be administered but to those of the years of maturity, and who, being capable of instruction, did, on a conviction of its being their duty, desire to be admitted into the church by that institution. This opinion they grounded on Christ's commission, in which teach∣ing is joined with baptism. These were called the <HI>moderate Baptists.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Those who gave into sundry errors, and being men of fierce and turbulent dispositions, raised in Germany a commotion called the <HI>rustic war,</HI> which got the Anabaptists in general a bad character.

</LIST></NOTE> But expecting per∣haps a greater lenity, or less vigilance, in the reign of his successor, they had lately come over again, and seduced some of Edward's subjects; which it was apprehended would throw a slur upon the refor∣mation, and be objected to the reformers in general by the Romanists, in their way of representing matters. A commission had accordingly been issued, the last year, for enquiring after, and prosecuting, these here∣tics; and many of them being seized, made all a recantation, except Jane Boacher (commonly called Joan of Kent), and George Van Paris, a Dutch∣man, before-mentioned, who were the only persons that suffered capitally, in this reign, for religious sentiments. The preceding year, there had been in∣tercepted a letter from Delft, May 12, 1549, ad∣dressed to Gardiner and another English Bishop, and acquainting them, "that the reformation had been carried on in England by Edward VI. with so much temper and judgment, that all the Protestants and other reformed in Germany, were inclined to unite with the English church, and establish episcopacy
<PB N="130" REF="139"/>among themselves; that it was the opinion of their learned men at Trent, that all foreign sects would adopt the English discipline, and become one unite body, and their principal divines, as Calvin, Bullin∣ger, and others, had actually made the offer; that such a union would be the ruin of the papacy, and there being no way so likely to prevent it, as by creat∣ing a division among the Protestants themselves, and raising sects and separations from the established doc∣trine of the church of England, N. S. and E. L. were therefore sent over to them, properly instructed, and recommended to the favour and protection of these two prelates, in case they should be checked by other heretics. Their particular charge was, to deny infant baptism, to assert the necessity of rebaptizing, and to preach up a future monarchy upon earth after death, which would please the ordinary people, and obstruct the proceedings of the reformers." This was probably the reason, why the council were so diligent and severe in prosecuting and suppressing the Anabaptists.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">The Episcopal robes jerupled by Hooper Bishop of Gloucester.</NOTE> But this was not the only sect the church of England had to guard against, the foundation being now laid for another, about matters of form and ceremony, by some exceptions started by John Hooper, collated, on July 3, to the see of Gloucester, upon the death of Wakeman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 30 of this volume.</NOTE>. Hooper had been educated at Oxford; had studied the scriptures with great diligence; and made a considerable progress in learning: he had, in the late King's reign, shewed his affection to the points of reformation, then established, in such a manner, that, after the act of the six articles, he did not think it safe to stay in England. Retiring to Zu∣rich, he became acquainted there with Bullinger and other learned men; and contracted there a fondness
<PB N="131" REF="140"/>for the worship and usages of the Zuinglian or Helvetic churches; though he differed from their divines in some part of doctrine, particularly concerning pre∣destination. Returning in this reign to England, he grew very popular by the constant exercise of his talent of preaching; and in such favour with the Earl of Warwick, that he not only recommended him to the King for the see of Gloucester, but wrote to Arch∣bishop Cranmer, on July 23, to excuse him from wearing the Rochet, and other pontifical habits, at his consecration, and from taking any oath burthensome to his conscience. The Archbishop could not dispense with the laws of the land, and the rules of the church, nor conserrate Hooper in the manner he desired, with∣out incurring a premunire: and, to remove this diffi∣culty, the King was persuaded to write a letter, on August 5, to Cranmer, "warranting him, by the advice of his council, to omit the ceremonies, that displeased Hooper, and discharging him from all man∣ner of dangers, penalties, and forfeitures, which he might incur by law for such an omission." Hooper's objection to the oath was not so much the matter of it, as to the form at the conclusion, <HI>So help me God, all Saints, and the Holy Gospels:</HI> and the King's striking out the words, <HI>all saints</HI> with his own hand, removed his scruples on that subject. Those, which he had entertained about the episcopal habits, still remained, nor would Cranmer and Ridley consent to the omission, considering it as a thing that would be destructive of all order, and be attended by numberless ill conse∣quences. They represented this so effectually to the King, that he grew very angry with Hooper for his unreasonable stiffness: and the Earl of Warwick think∣ing fit to drop him too, he was, for his disobedience and contempt, ordered to keep his house, and not stir out, unless to see the Archbishop, or the Bishop of London, Ely, and Lincoln, for the satisfaction of his conscience, and neither to preach or write without
<PB N="132" REF="141"/>a farther licence from the council. Hooper was a per∣tinacious, morose, opiniative man: and all the argu∣ments, which those learned prelates used, to convince him of his errors, served only to heighten his obsti∣nacy. His letters to Bucer, Peter Martyr, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llinger, and others, to whom he had sent the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ons of his refusal to wear any habits of the same kind or fashion of those worn by the Romanists, did not produce an∣swers to his mind: all those divines, though used to churches in which no distinction of garments was observed, declaring their opinion, that things of an indifferent nature, as habits were, could not be made unlawful by others wearing them, and advising him to comply<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nevertheless, Peter Martyr, in one of his epistles, dated at Zurich, Nov. 1559, affirms that he himself never used the surplice, when he lived at Oxford, though he was a canon of Christ church there, and frequently in the choir.</NOTE>. He still persisted in his obstinacy: and, in contempt of the order of council, wrote and printed a book, intitled, <HI>a confession of his faith,</HI> in order to justify his conduct; written in such a manner as to give a great distate, and containing matters that deserved censure; and went abroad freely, preach∣ing in the churches of London, saying things too bitter and unreasonable in his sermons, and exclaiming wherever he went against the King's counsellors. Being called, in the beginning of the year following, on January 13, before the council, and persisting in his former opiniative obstinacy, he was committed to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to be either reformed, or punished, as the case required. The Archbishop finding him quite untractable, he was sent, soon after, to the Fleet prison: and, consenting, at last, to wear the episcopal robes, was consecrated on March 8; being dispensed with for wearing them as a daily habit, and only obliged to use them whenever he preached before the King, in his own cathedral, or in all other
<PB N="133" REF="142"/>public places<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">While this controversy was on foot, John Rogers, one of the Prebendaries of St. Paul's cathedral, and Divinity reader there, now returned from beyond seas, could never be persuaded to wear any other than the round cap when he went abroad. Being pressed to a compliance, he declared that he would never agree to use the cap, tippet, &amp;c. unless all Popish priests should, for distinction's sake, be constrained to wear upon their sleeves a chalice with an hoste in it. Nay, such an humour of recusancy then began to break out, that one Steven, curate of Catherine Cree church, preached at St. Paul's cross, that it was fit the names of churches should be altered, and the names of the days of the week changed; that fish-days should be altered, and Lent kept at any other time, except between Shrove∣tide and Easter. John Stow, in his chronicles, saith, that be had seen the said Steven leave the pulpit, and preach to the people from an high elm tree, which stood in the midst of the church-yard, and, after sermon was done, return to the church.</NOTE>. Thus arose that opposition, which has continued ever since, against the liturgy, the cap, surplice, and other usages of the church of England. John a Lasco, abusing the indulgence of the government to his foreign congregations, not only encouraged Hooper in his scruples, but joined with the <HI>Calvinian</HI> faction, which now began to appear, in all their ob∣jections to the cap and surplice, and other orders of the church; for which he was severely reptimanded by Bucer, a man of excellent learning, judgment, temper, and moderation; who, making a solid answer to all his ob∣jections, sent it him in a letter, which was afterwards published. John a Lasco had received his education in Poland, a country over run with Arians and Soci∣nians, who, denying the divinity of our Saviour, treated him in a manner as their equal, by sitting with him at his table: and, publishing a book, entitled, <HI>Forma et ratio totius ecclesiastici ministerii,</HI> maintained the prac∣tice of <HI>sitting at the Holy Communion,</HI> contrary to the usage and express direction of the church of England.</P>
<P>Some of the zealous opposers of the habits were ridiculous enough, to require an alteration in the names of the days of the week,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Calvin in∣termeddles.</NOTE> and that Lent should be kept at any other
<PB N="134" REF="143"/>season, or time, than that which had been observed by the primitive church. The difficulties which, for want of the proposed reform of ecclesiastical laws, the Bishops lay under in the exercise of their authority, prevented the irregularities of those refractory persons from being repressed by a proper discipline. When, in the first part of this King's reign, the government had set about a reformation, Cavlin had wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, offering his service in the work: but Cranmer knew the busy, pragmatical tem∣per of the man too well to accept his officer. This was a slight that Calvin's pride could not digest: failing in his application to the Archbishop, he endeavoured to insinuate himself into the Protector's favour; and, succeeding in his design, wrote him a very long letter, in which, approving of set forms of prayer, he finds fault with the English liturgy in some particulars. These were, <HI>the commemoration of the dead,</HI> which he acknowledged however to be very antient, <HI>the use of chrism,</HI> and the <HI>unction</HI> in the visitation of the sick, the last whereof was rather allowed then enjoined. He advised, that these, with some other rites and cere∣monies, should be abrogated: he had emissaries every where to start objections against what had been establish∣ed without his advice; and was for having every thing given up, that offended a few particulars, and might become matter of contention. Thus altars were to be taken down, being complained of as encouraging peo∣ple in the Popish notions of the sacrifice of the mass; they had been removed already in some places, and tables put in their stead, by persons who thought the latter more agreeable to primitive christianity, since our Saviour instituted the sacrament of his body and blood at a table, not at an altar, and there is no ap∣pearance of the Apostles having ever used an altar in their ministration. An order of council was made, on November 24, and sent to the Bishops, for taking away altars in every church and chapel of their respective
<PB N="135" REF="144"/>dioceses, and setting up tables in their stead, in some convenient part of the chancel of such church, to serve for the ministration of the holy communion. Ridley took care to execute this order, without loss of time, in his own diocese; but it was not observed universally over the kingdom, till the repeal of the first liturgy, in which the priest was directed to stand <HI>before the mid∣dle of the altar</HI> in the celebration, and the establishment of the second, which requires him to stand <HI>on the north side of the table.</HI> It was pretended, that this change was not any way repugnant to the rules of the first liturgy, because the names of <HI>altar, the Lord's board,</HI> and <HI>table,</HI> were used in it indifferently; and the same position <HI>before the middle of the table</HI> might be still observed: it caused however a great diversity of prac∣tice, till the revision of the liturgy, set about by Cal∣vin's influence, was finished.</P>
<P>The Lady Mary, bred up in the Roman Catholic religion, and attached by her own interests to those of the Papacy,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Princess Mary, refu∣sing to con∣form, designs to quit the kingdom.</NOTE> on which her mo∣ther's marriage, and her own legitimacy, depended, would admit of no alteration in the public offices used in her own cha∣pel, where her priests said masses daily. The King had wrote to her many letters to draw her off from the church of Rome; the Lords of the council had done the same, but all in vain; she would confer with none of the Bishops sent to instruct her, nor hearken to any arguments against her present persuasion. She had, out of regard to the Emperor, been hitherto indulged in having mass said in her family, but with two restrictions, viz. that no body should be present at it besides her own domestic servants, and that her chaplains should celebrate it only in her pre∣sence. Her spirit was too haughty to bear these re∣strictions, and her obstinacy was too determinate to allow her to conform. In this situation, she resolved to retire to the court of the Queen Regent in Flanders;
<PB N="136" REF="145"/>a step, which in all probability would have prevented her succession to the crown of England, and cannot be accounted for, but from the great idea she had formed of the Emperor's irresistible power. A scheme was laid for conveying her beyond sea from Essex, where she then resided: Flemish ships were provided to re∣ceive her on board; and a commotion was to be raised in the country, that she might in the tumult escape. The King, being informed of the design, sent, on July 13, Sir John Gates, with some forces, to pre∣vent its execution; and ordered the coast to be secured, and a fleet to put to sea: and dispatched the Lord Chancellor Rich, with Sir W. Petre, to bring up the Princess to court. She came very unwillingly as far as the Chancellor's house, absolutely refusing to pro∣ceed any farther; and, a sickness breaking out in his family, which seemed to be contagious, she was let alone for a while, and seems to have returned to her former residence. Orders were sent, on December 15, to apprehend her chaplains, Mallet and Berkley, for not observing the restrictions above mentioned: they were committed to prison; nor could all her instances procure their release. Several letters passed between her and the council on the subject; in which she in∣sisted much on a promise, made to the Emperor, for a dispensation with the laws in her favour; and they denied its being made, at least in such a latitude as she pretended.</P>
<P>A. D. 1551.] The Imperial ambassador interposing in her behalf, she came to Westminster, and had, on March 18, a conference with the King and council. On this occasion, declaring her resolution not to change her opinions in religion, she was told, that the King did not purpose to constrain her in that point, but only to restrain her in the outward profession of it, on ac∣count of the inconveniences that might thence ensue. The Emperor's ambassador threatening, in his name, to denounce war, if she was not allowed the free exer∣cise of her religion, Dr. Wotton was sent over, a∣bout
<PB N="137" REF="146"/>the middle of April, with directions, "to desire that the Emperor would be less violent in his requests," and to inform him, "that if the Lady Mary was his cousin, she was likewise the King's sister, and his sub∣ject too; that, as the King was a Sovereign Prince de∣pending on none but God, there was no reason for the Emperor to intermeddle, either with ordering his sub∣jects, or directing the affairs of his realm." He was however authorised to offer, "that whatever favours the King's subjects were allowed in the Emperor's do∣minions in point of religion, the Emperor's subjects should receive the same in England; but further than this, his master would not go; and it would be in vain to press him any more on the subject." This resolute answer prevented any more such menaces for the future.</P>
<P>On August 12, Rochester, Waldegrave, and Ingle∣field, the chief officers of the Princess Mary's houshold, being sent for to court, were charged with orders from the council, inhibiting the use of any service, but the English liturgy, in her family, and with letters from the King notifying these orders to his sister. They were likewise enjoined, to notify these orders to her houshold, and to stay there to see them observed: but, upon her forbidding them to do so, they returned, without executing this part of their commission. The council requiring them to go back to Copthall, and execute it, they all refused: and were for the con∣tempt sent prisoners to the Tower; from whence they were not discharged till the April following. The council chose to signify the inhibition to the Princess, by her own servants, imagining it would palliate the harshness of the order: but upon their refusal the Lord Chancellor Rich, Sir Ant. Wingfield, and Sir W. Petre, were sent to see it executed. The Empe∣ror's ambassador, interposing, was told, that the King would have the laws observed by all his subjects; and the Princess finding that the Emperor's authority availed her so little, gave little further trouble on that subject, though she had met with several mortifications
<PB N="138" REF="147"/>from the council, and even from the King himself, whose zeal bordered on the spirit of persecution.</P>
<P>Henry Brandon Duke of Suffolk, and his brother Charles, being both cut off, on July 14, by the sweat∣ing sickness, which now made its appearance the third time in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This malady began at Shrewsbury, on April 15, and spread over most parts of the kingdom, raging in a terrible manner till the end of September. It was never known in this nation, till the begin∣ning of the reign of Henry VII.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page <HI>375</HI> of vol. <HI>ii.</HI> of this work.</NOTE> and was so peculiar to the Eng∣lish, that it seized and carried them off in other countries, without affecting any of the natives; and no foreigners were troubled with it in England. Any person that was seized with it, either died or re∣covered in about ten hours; if a man indulged the inclination it gave him to sleep, he died in six hours; and in half that time if he catched any cold. It raged mostly among persons of robust constitutions; old men and women, and young children, being either not subject to it, or attacked but very slightly; and it proved so fatal that scarce one in a hundred escaped, till time had found out a remedy, by the following method. Those seized with it by night, in bed, were to keep there twenty-four hours; if in the day time, to throw themselves imme∣diately, with their cloaths on, into bed for the same term; not covered so much as to provoke sweat, but to let it flow off gently. They were to abstain, if possible, from eating or drinking, or at least not drink more than just sufficient to asswage their thirst: and, above all, they were not to uncover any part of their bodies; the putting a hand or foot out of bed being mortal. At London eight hundred died of it in a week: and a great number were carried off by it in the rest of the kingdom. A little before this distemper broke out, a terrible earthquake happened at Croydon in Surry, and some other places in the neighbourhood. Six dolphins were taken in the Thames, three at Queenborough, and the other three below Greenwich, all as big as horses. These uncommon accidents were looked upon by credulous and ignorant people, as presages of the troubles which soon afterwards afflicted the kingdom.</NOTE>, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, had an opportunity to gratify Henry Grey Marquis of Dorset (who had married Frances, these noblemens sister of the half blood, and the eldest daughter of Charles Brandon, by Mary, sister to Henry VIII.) with the title of the Duke of Suffolk. This honour was conferred on him on October 11; Warwick being, at the same time, created Duke of Northumberland;
<PB N="139" REF="148"/>William Pawlet, Earl of Wiltshire, Marquis of Win∣chester; and Sir W. Herbert, Baron of Cardist and Earl of Pembroke. These two last were Dudley's creatures, subservient to him in all his measures; and in raising the latter to these honours, he had highly obliged William Parr Marquis of Northampton, whose sister Herbert had married. The new Duke of Suffolk, a weak man, and easily drawn into any step, natu∣rally fell under Northumberland's management, upon the alliance between them by the marriage of his fifth son, Lord Guilford Dudley, with the Lady Jane Grey, the other's eldest daughter. This young lady, one of the most accomplished of the age, was next to her mother in the succession of the crown, in case of Ed∣ward's decease, had the lines of the two daughters of Henry VIII. and of his sister Margaret, been extinct<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 60 of this volume.</NOTE>: and, as Northumberland proposed to set aside the two Princesses, Mary and Elizabeth, on pretence of ille∣gitimacy, and depending on the aversion of the En∣glish to a Scotch and French government, designed to exclude the descendants of Margaret, whose heir, Mary Queen of Scotland, was contracted to Francis Dauphin of France, and to raise his own family to the throne of England.</P>
<P>As he had little reason to expect much opposition,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Duke of Somerset tried and beheaded.</NOTE> excepting from the Duke of Somerset, and a few of his friends, he de∣termined to work their ruin. The reconciliation be∣tween Somerset and him, on an alliance of their fa∣milies, by a marriage between John Dudley Earl of Warwick (Northumberland's eldest son) and Somer∣set's daughter Lady Anne, was but feigned on the the part of Northumberland, who soon found an op∣portunity of effecting his rival's destruction. After the suppression of the commotions in Devonshire, Norfolk, &amp;c. already mentioned, an act to prevent
<PB N="140" REF="149"/>such insurrections for the future had passed, making it "treason for more than twelve persons to assemble together, in order to pull down inclosures, alter reli∣gion, or any of the laws, or to take, kill, or imprison, a Privy Counsellor, if they did not disperse within an hour after the reading of a proclamation." After some other paragraphs relating to the principal design of the act, a clause was added, enacting, "that if any person or persons should, by open word or deed, procure, move, or stir, any other person or persons to rise, or make any other traiterous or rebellious assem∣bly, with intent to do, exercise, or put in use any of the things above-mentioned, every person should be adjudged a felon, and suffer death and forfeitures, as in cases of felony, without either benefit of clergy or sanctuary." Upon this act was founded the plan for entrapping Somerset; the putting him in fear of his life would naturally make him take measures to defend it; and Northumberland's openly avowing himself his enemy afforded grounds enough for such apprehensions. A gentleman named Whalley had been taken up and examined, on February 16, about his persuading se∣veral noblemen of the realm, to make the Duke of Somerset Protector at the next parliament: and though no further discovery appears to have been made of this design, it was thought impolitic to let the Duke live till the next session.—To pave the way for his ruin, he was represented as a proud aspiring person, whose ambition had no other bounds than the crown itself. His doors were watched, and notice taken of all that went in or out; his words were observed, made worse by repeating, and aggravated by odious circumstan∣ces to his disadvantage: and no arts of fraud and treachery left unpractised, that might bring him into suspicion with the King, and disgrace with the com∣mon people. Somerset's friends soon suspected, that these practices were the prelude to his and their ruin: and it is not unlikely, that, in conferring together upon
<PB N="141" REF="150"/>this subject, some hot inconsiderate person might pro∣pose a violent attempt against the Duke of Northum∣berland, though no measures seem to have been taken for putting such a design in execution. However Northumberland had so beset the King with his crea∣tures, that nothing could come to his ear but through their conveyance: and things were so represented, that he consented to the prosecution of his uncle. What confirmed him in this resolution, seems to have been an information, given, on October 7, by Sir Thomas Palmer, "that, on the last St. George's day, So∣merset proposed setting out for the North to raise people, if Sir W. Herbert, Master of the Horse, had not assured him upon his honour, that he should have no hurt, and the Lord Grey went before to see who were his friends; that afterwards it was contrived to invite Northumberland, Northampton and others to a banquet, and either to kill them there, or set upon them by the way, if they came thinly attended; that Sir Thomas Arundel had secured the Tower, Sir Miles Partridge, attended by Seymour and Hammond, was to raise London; that Sir Ralph Vane, with 2000 foot, which he had in readiness, and Somerset's troop of 100 horse, were to attack the Gens d'Armes on a muster-day; and, if he were beaten, the Duke was to run through London, crying, <HI>Liberty, liberty,</HI> to raise the apprentices, and, if he could, to make his way to Poole or the Isle of Wight." Somerset, being apprised of the reformation, charged Palmer with it: but he absolutely denied it.—His grace, with the Lord Grey, John and David Seymour, Neudigate, Ham∣mond, two of the Duke's servants, Sir Thomas Pal∣mer, and Sir Ralph Vane, were arrested, and all, ex∣cept the three last, committed to the Tower; the next day, the Duchess of Somerset, with her favourites Crane and his wife, and her chamber keeper, Sir Miles Partridge, and James Wingfield, were sent to the same prison; as Sir Michael Stanhope, Bannister, and
<PB N="142" REF="151"/>Vaughan, were, the day following. Crane deposed much to the same effect as Palmer, only adding, "that the Lord Paget's house was to be the place of the banquet; that the Earl of Arundel knew of the con∣spiracy; and that, in August last, the Duke of So∣merset, pretending to be sick, had gone privately into London, to see what friends he could make in the city." All that Hammond confessed, amounted to no more, than that "the Duke had armed men to guard him, one night, in his house at Greenwich." Arundel, and Paget, were hereupon sent, on Novem∣ber 8, to the Tower: and the prosecution slept till December 1, when Somerset was brought to his trial in Westminster hall, before the Marquis of Winchester, as high steward. Twenty seven peers composed the jury; Northumberland, Northampton and Pembroke, the first a party, and all three his professed enemies, being of the number; and, what was as surprising, the Lord Chancellor Rich, though a peer, was left out.</P>
<P>To make up in parade, what might be defective in the force of the evidence, twenty-two peers had been extraordinarily assembled, the day before the trial, to hear Palmer, Crane, and Hammond swear, before the King and council, to the truth of what they had affirmed in their different examinations, which were drawn up in form, in order to be produ∣ced in court at the trial. These depositions were calculated to support three indictments against the Duke for so many different designs,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To seize the King's person, and govern all affairs:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To seize, in conjunction with 100 others, on the Duke of Nor∣thumberland, and imprison him: and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To raise London.</ITEM>
</LIST> He pressed to have the witnesses brought face to face, that he might have an opportunity of cross examining them; a point of justice, which the Lord Chancellor would scarce have refused, had he been high steward: but the Marquis of Winchester absolutely refused his request; and the whole evi∣dence
<PB N="143" REF="152"/>rested upon the written depositions above-men∣tioned, no part whereof contained any proof of the first indictment. The council for the King, in ag∣gravating other charges, represented "the raising of men at his house, with an ill intent to kill the Duke of Northumberland, to be treason, by the act of 3 and 4 of Edward VI. <HI>against unlawful assemblies;</HI> that the raising of London was likewise treason; that minding to resist his attachment, assaulting the Lords of the council, and devising their deaths, were felony." Somerset, having no council to plead for him, ex∣cepted to Palmer as a very wicked man, and urged in his defence, "that he had never any thoughts of raising the North, and all the grounds for such a sur∣mise was, that, being alarmed by rumours of a design against his person, he had sent for Sir William Her∣bert, to be assured in the matter. As to the ban∣quet, he protested in the solemnest manner, there was not a syllable of truth in it, and required some other witnesses of that charge might be produced. The attacking of 900 Gens d' armes on a muster-day, with only 100 men, was too mad an action for any body to attempt: and he utterly denied it, as well as any design of raising London, though thinking it the safest place for him, he had gone into the city, to see if he could find shelter there; none of the witnesses being with him, so that they could be no competent evidence of his design. He owned his having men one night in his chamber at Greenwich: but said he meant no harm to any body, and none in particular to the Duke of Northumberland, whose life he was so far from endeavouring to take away, that he had determined to the contrary; that he had assembled those men purely for his own defence; and it was plain, he meant no harm, because he did none when it was in his power." Such was his defence with regard to the facts charged upon him, and he was acquitted by the Lords as to the treasonable articles: but, though no invitation or
<PB N="144" REF="153"/>other circumstance was alledged with regard to the banquet, nor was there the smallest evidence of any assault upon the Lords; yet, whether the men in his chamber at Greenwich were imagined to have been assembled, not for opposing any illegal violence to his person (which seems to have been the real case) but to resist a legal attachment, they found him guilty of fe∣lony, and condemned him to be hanged. Somerset received the sentence with great resignation; and having begged the pardon of the Lords, against whom he had any ill-will, and recommended himself, his wife and children, to the King's mercy, was sent back to the Tower. The populace, seeing him reconveyed thi∣ther without the axe, imagined he had been entirely acquitted, and manifested their joy in repeated shouts and exclamations, till they were informed of his doom, and that there was no occasion for the axe being carried, as he had been acquitted of the indictment for treason. It was unfortunate for the condemned nobleman, that the King was so environed with his adversaries, that none of his friends could get access, or find any means to represent his innocence, and detect the artifices and treachery of his enemies; for Palmer was the person, who, alarming him with the imminent dan∣ger he was in, persuaded him to gather men into his chamber at Greenwich, and six weeks after his death was put into an honourable employment by Northum∣berland, one of whose chief confidents he was ever af∣ter, in the advancements of all his projects, particularly in that of getting the succession settled in the house of Suffolk. Lord Rich, the chancellor, interested him∣self in behalf of Somerset; but this correspondence being accidentally discovered, he was divested of the great seal, the custody of which was committed to Thomas Goodwich, bishop of Ely. The King having signed the warrant for beheading his uncle, that noble∣man, on January 22, in the ensuing year, was between eight and nine in the morning brought to a scaffold
<PB N="145" REF="154"/>on Tower hill, and addressing himself to the people, assured them, that "his intentions had been not only harmless in respect to particular persons, but always tending to the common good of the King and kingdom." He was interrupted for a while by the crouds which came running from the Hamlets, and by Sir Anthony Brown's advancing to the place on a gallop, which caused a general expectation of a pardon, and great shouts of joy among the populace. When the tumult was over, he went on "to make a confession of his faith; blessing God for making him an instrument in the reformation; exhorting all to persevere in it, to obey the King, whom he had never offended by word or deed; having been ever diligent in taking care of his affairs both at home and abroad, and in promoting the good of the people (to which the populace assented, crying out, <HI>it was very true</HI>) and declaring he forgave all the world," submitted to the block with great tranquillity, firmness, and intrepidity. Thus fell Ed∣ward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, a nobleman of a middling genius, not without virtues, being gentle and beneficent in his nature, humble and affable in his great∣ness, sincere and candid in his transactions, compassi∣onate to the afflicted, careful of the poor, animated with zeal for the religion he thought right, and so well be∣loved by the people, that numbers of them dipped their handkerchiefs in his blood, to keep him in their remembrance. His good qualities were intervoven with strong passions, among which pride, ambition, and vanity, seemed to preponderate: but his admi∣nistration of public affairs was never charged with any blemish of corruption; and no encomium but is due to his merit in the excellent education he gave his Prince; an advantage few meet with that succeed to the throne in their minority.</P>
<P>Several of Somerset's friends suffered,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Somerset's friends exe∣cuted.</NOTE> soon after, on the same account. Sir Thomas Arundel, Sir Michael Stanhope,
<PB N="146" REF="155"/>Sir Ralph Vane, and Sir Miles Partridge, were all executed on February 26; the two first being behead∣ed, and the others hanged. They all calling God to witness, declared at their death, that "they never practised treason against the King, nor were guilty of any design against any of the Lords of the council." These agreeing declarations, made at the awful mo∣ment of their launching into futurity, confirmed the world in the notion generally entertained before, that the pretended conspiracy was all a mere forgery.</P>
<P>Somerset's affair did not prevent or impede the pro∣secution of the Bishops,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Several Pre∣lates deprived of their sees.</NOTE> who, retaining their inclinations to the Papacy, pretended to conform: and, by that means keeping possession of their sees, were enabled to protect and encourage others in a breach of the establish∣ed orders, and to obstruct a general uniformity in worship and discipline. John Verey, Bishop of Ex∣eter, had alienated most of the manors belonging to his see; he had granted long leases of others to some courtiers, charged with pensions for his own benefit: and, being either willing to secure these, which amount∣ed to 485 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year for his life, or apprehensive of some trouble, for having, by underhand practices, favoured the Devonshire insurrection, resigned his office. His advanced age, being 87 years old, gave a colour to this act, which secured the revenue he had provided for himself, at the expence of his see: and he was succeeded by Miles Coverdale, who had assisted Tin∣dal in the translation of the Bible, and was consecrated on August 30. George Day, Bishop of Chichester, had preached himself, and suffered others of his diocese to preach, seditious doctrines; to prevent the bad effects whereof, Dr. Cox had, the last year, on October 7, been sent into Sussex to appease the people by more wholesome doctrine: and the Bishop, being summoned before the council, was, upon his denial of the words of his accusation, ordered, on November 8, to bring
<PB N="147" REF="156"/>in writing what he preached. He probably thought this too dangerous: and therefore, on the 28th of that month, he signified voluntarily to the Duke of Somer∣set, that he would not execute the orders, sent him by the King and council; for taking down altars in his diocese, for setting communion-tables up in some con∣venient part of the chancels, and for instructing people in the reasonableness of the alteration. He was, on this account, convened several times before the coun∣cil in the beginning of December: and though he was allowed the liberty of using the names of table and altar indifferently, continued so obstinate in his refu∣sal, that he was committed to the Fleet. A commis∣sion being issued this year for his examination and trial, he was deprived in the beginning of October; and succeeded by John Scory, Bishop of Rochester. Ni∣cholas Heath, Bishop of Worcester, had been impri∣soned some time for refusing to subscribe the new or∣dinal: and, appearing before the council, on Septem∣ber 22, not only persisted in that refusal, but declared, he would never consent to the order for setting up tables in room of altars. Being tried for these con∣tempts, at the same time with Day, he was deprived on October 10, and his see was granted to John Hooper Bishop of Gloucester; the two dioceses being united. Cuthbert Tonstal, Bishop of Durham, had been accused, by Ninian Menville, of knowing, and consenting to, a conspiracy in the north, for raising a rebellion; he had, in July last year, made an answer to that charge, and Menville had replied to it; but the prosecution was long suspended, for want of a letter of the Bishop's to Menville, on which the proof chiefly depended. This letter was at last found among the Duke of Somerset's papers, when they were searched after his last apprehension; and Tonstal was sum∣moned to appear, on December 20, before the coun∣cil. He could not deny the letter to-be his own hand-writing, and, being incapable of giving any sa∣tisfactory
<PB N="148" REF="157"/>account of it, was committed to the Tower of London; where he wrote his defence of transub∣stantiation, printed three years after at Paris. Nor were the Bishops popishly inclined the only persons that suffered, at this time, from prosecutions Robert Farrar, Bishop of St. David's, having disobliged the chapter of his church, had articles exhibited against him by a factious party of the canons: and, being di∣vested of the support and protection he used to receive from his patron the Duke of Somerset, a commission was issued, to enquire into the merits of the cause. The articles in general could not but appear trifling, when the most material of them were, his going abroad some∣times without a square cap; his having married a cou∣ple, without obliging them to receive the communion; his causing the communion-table to be put in or near the place where the altar had stood; his suffering seve∣ral superstitious usages to be retained among the peo∣ple (which, in all probability, so zealous a reformer could not help, since the Welch could not be entirely weaned from them of a long time, notwithstanding all the care of his successors) and for exercising some acts of episcopal jurisdiction in his own name, in derogation of the King's supremacy. The last article proved more fatal to him than all the rest; being indicted the summer following of a premunite, at the assizes of Caermarthen, and committed to prison: where he re∣mained all the rest of Edward's reign; and was, in Queen Mary's time, carried thence, to suffer at the stake for his religion.</P>
<P>A. D. 1552.] The parliament met, this year, on January 23, as the convocation did the next day,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings in the parliament and convoca∣tion.</NOTE> chiefly for ecclesiastical matters; though some acts of a civil nature passed in the first of those assemblies. The act for confirming the attainders of the Duke of Somerset, and his fellow sufferers, Arundel, Stanhope, Vane, and Partridge, passed by the Lords in a hurry,
<PB N="149" REF="158"/>being read thrice the same day, was rejected by the Commons; nor would these last oblige the Duke of Northumberland in agreeing to another bill for depri∣ving the Bishop of Durham, which had likewise passed the upper house; though strongly opposed by the Arch∣bishop of Canterbury and the Lord Stourton, who entered their dissents. A bill was brought in for qua∣lifying the statute of premunire; and for providing, that no Bishops or spiritual judge should incur-it by executing his office, unless he proceeded after a pro∣hibition from the courts of law: but this dropped in the upper house, the Lords prob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly not caring to en∣courage or secure the Bishops in the free exercise of their jurisdiction. They had however so much regard to the honour both of church and state, as to pass an act, with severe penalties, against quarrelling, and fighting in churches and church-yards; to prevent the profaning of confecrated places, by such scandalous frays as had been too much practised of late, since the episcopal jurisdiction, and ancient censures of the church, were lessened in authority and reputation. The dioceses of London and Westminster had been, about two years before, unit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by letters-patent; it was now thought proper to have its union confirmed by parlia∣ment; the authority whereof was probably the more necessary, because the archdeaconry of St. Alban's, formerly part of the diocese of Lincoln, was, on this occasion, annexed to that of London.</P>
<P>On April 15, the parliament was dissolved,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The articles of religion published.</NOTE> having first passed two very material acts relating to religion, which had been be∣fore approved of by the convocation. One of these was for the due observation of fasts and holidays. It was decreed, that all Sundays, with the holidays marked in the calendar and liturgy, should be kept as holidays; and that the Bishops should proceed by ecclesiastical censure against the refractory. A clause was added for the observation of St. George's

<PB N="150" REF="161"/>feast by the knights of the garter; and another in favour of labourers or fishermen, who might work on those days in case of necessity. The eves of holidays were ordained to be kept as fasts; and abstinence from flesh on Fridays and Saturdays, as well as in Lent, was en∣joined. In these regulations, the parliament traced the steps of the rubric in the liturgy,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The liturgy revised and authorised.</NOTE> establishing none but what had been before appointed by the convocation. They took the same method in the act of uni∣formity now passed, establishing the book of Common∣prayer, and the ordinal, which, being sent from the convocation, in order to have the sanction of a law added to them, they would have taked to the act, without ever reading them: but this seeming too im∣plicit a deference to the clergy, and not becoming the dignity and wisdom of so august an assembly, as the parliament of England, they did read it over, but made not the smallest alteration. Calvin, with his emissaries and followers, who were dispersed in different parts of the realm, and were for retrenching every an∣cient usage, upon which the Romanists had grafted any superstitious or erroneous novelty, had made it their business to raise doubts about some passages in the liturgy, as capable of being wrested so, as to favour the errors and novelties which had been abolished: and, in compliance with their importunity, rather than their reasons, it had been revised by a committee of the convocation. The alterations that were made on this occasion were, a short form of confession, and a decla∣ration of a general absolution to all, that sincerely re∣pent, and firmly believe in the gospel, added to the morning and evening service; and a rubric about the posture of kneeling at the reception of the eucharist; the omission of the sign of the cross, and prayers for souls departed, in the communion-service, and of oil in confirmation; the introducing of the ten com∣mandments, with a prayer to God, at the end of each,
<PB N="151" REF="162"/>for mercy on past offences, and grace to keep them for the future, into that service, instead of the <HI>introit;</HI> a change in the form of words and at the delivery, and in some part of the prayer for the consecration of the eucharist, with some lesser variations. The liturgy, thus revised and altered, was now, together with the ordinal, confirmed by act of parliament.</P>
<P>That assembly did not interfere in another affair, which passed at this time in convocation, to whose cog∣nizance it properly belonged. When well-meaning men, in former days, sound fault with the corruptions of the <HI>court of Rome,</HI> or rejected any of the new notions of the schoolmen, it was an ordinary policy in the Romanists, not only to charge those men with other doctrines, which they either did not profess, or express∣ly disavowed, but also with such as were most likely to render them odious. The same method was taken with regard to Luther and his followers in Germany; who, to refute the calumnies thrown upon them, found it necessary to draw up <HI>a confession of their faith</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">See it in vol. i. of this work, p. 128.</NOTE>, and present it to Charles V. and the estates of the empire, assembled, in 1530, at the diet of Augsburgh. It had the desired effect, and the example was followed by other reformed churches; who, being likewise aspersed, were obliged to take the like method of a public vin∣dication. These <HI>confessions</HI> were not only very useful for repelling the attacks of their adversaries, but served also for a stated rule among themselves, in confor∣mity to which all private persons, of their respective communion, were to form their judgments, and for declaring the harmony between them and other nati∣onal churches, which had thrown off the Papal yoke. The clergy of the church of England had answered these ends, in a good measure, by the public liturgy, and the homilies published in the English tongue for the instruction of the people: but it was still conceived
<PB N="152" REF="163"/>necessary, at least for the satisfaction of the foreign world, to lay down in form a public rule, as well to testify their orthodoxy in all the essential articles of faith, as to shew their dissent from the innovations of the church of Rome, and of the opinions of the Ana∣baptists and other sectaries. With these views, Cran∣mer, Ridley, and other divines, drew up a book of articles; which being now approved in convocation, were translated into Latin by Dr. Heddon, university orator at Cambridge, and Sir John Cheek, and pub∣lished in Latin by the royal authority, enjoining all the clergy to subscribe them, "for the avoiding of diver∣sities of opinions, and for establishing consent touching true religions." It was impossible, in such a work, to avoid touching on some points canvassed in the schools, which the warmth of debates made people, at that time, imagine to be of greater consequence than they are in reality: but there were as few notions of this kind in them, as the exigence of the times would allow. These articles agree in substance with those af∣terwards established in the convocation of 1562; the latter being rather explanatory of the former in points, wherein there is a variety of expression, than any way different in respect of doctrine. A catechism was like∣wise published at this time for the instruction of youth, after being revised and approved by a committee of the convocation.</P>
<P>The Popish partizans object very un∣reasonably against such <HI>confessions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="inter">Remarks on ecclesiastical councils.</NOTE> made in provincial councils, arrogating to the Pope the calling of general councils, the presidency thereof, and even a superiority over them; choosing to have every thing of that nature determined in assemblies subject to the Pontiff's influence, and making his dictates the rule of their decisions in all points of doctrine. That this hath been the case in most general councils for seven hundred years past, is too notorious to be denied: but, to confine matters of
<PB N="153" REF="164"/>faith to such assemblies, is contrary to the practice of the Christian church in all ages; from which it appears, that, for one heresy censured in general councils, there have been an hundred condemned in provincial and national synods. The primitive church was governed, and all determinations in matters of faith, for the first three centuries, by provincial synods only; and a ge∣neral council was not so much as known, till, the em∣pire becoming Christian, the council of Nice was call∣ed by the Emperor Constantine<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 40 of vol. i. of this work.</NOTE>. This, being com∣posed of Bishops, deputed by their colleagues in every province of the empire, and qualified to attest the doc∣trines received in each, was more truly general than any which has been since honoured with that title; scarce any one whereof was composed of the like exten∣sive representation, or equally free in its proceedings. It is not the number of Bishops that makes a council general; it cannot be so, but by a general deputation from all provincial or national churches; what gives force to its decrees, is the reception thereof by such churches; and what distinguishes the orthodox deci∣sions of some general councils, from the clashing and heretical ones of others, is the reception of the former, and the rejection of the latter, by particular churches, which compose the church universal. It is now, and hath been for many ages, utterly impracticable to assem∣ble a council deserving the name of general; the four patriarchates of the east being under the dominion of infidels, too jealous to suffer any number of Bishops of the Greek church to attend at western councils: which used, by publishing <HI>croisades,</HI> to spirit up devout war∣riors in infinite numbers to invade their country. Nor is it easy to assemble a general council of the western Bishops alone, by reason of the jarring interests of Princes, who will not allow their Prelates to go out of their dominions to attend it, when they do not like
<PB N="154" REF="165"/>the occasion of its being called, or the influence that directs its proceedings.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Further pro∣ceedings in the Council of Trent.</NOTE> This is confirmed in the council of Trent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 47 of this volume.</NOTE>, which, after a long suspension, renewed its sessions the last year on May 1; and adjourned to September 1; the French ambassador having entered a protest, in his master's name, that the King of France (then engaged in a war with the Pope, in behalf of the Duke of Parma) would not send his Bishops thither, nor observe any of its de∣crees. The council however proceeded, without the assistance of the French prelates, to make, in the sessions of October 11, and November 25, several de∣crees, relative, as well to what they stiled reformation, as doctrine, with regard to the eucharist, penance, and extreme unction; but in such a manner, as to procure little respect to their decision, and to shock the wisest and best of the Romish communion. It appears from the letters of Vargas, one of the Emperor's ambassa∣dors who was at the council, that "Cardinal Cre∣scentio, and the other legates, would not deviate a jot from the Pope's orders, to save the world; that nothing could either be proposed, debated, or defined, but by their consent, and in such manner as they di∣rected; that they acted in an arbitrary, over-bearing, imperious, and, on some occasions, in a brutal man∣ner, abusing, reviling, and threatening Bishops, who said any thing which they did not like; that there was no shadow of liberty, nor the least traces of a general council, in all its proceedings, and it could not but end ingloriously, leaving the church in a worse condi∣tion than it was in before; that the canons for reform∣ing abuses were so trifling, that several were ashamed to hear them; and, though some Bishops called it a pretended reformation, and it was really so infamous, as it would make the council a jest to the world, yet no
<PB N="155" REF="166"/>other, nor any better order was ever to be expected; the authority of the see of Rome being saved in all things so, that what the Pope did not like stood for nothing; that, when gross abuses were com∣plained of, the matter was compounded; that which passed uncensured being established for ever, and what was censured, being easily eluded. As to their decrees in matters of doctrine, after hearing the debates of some scholastic divines on the subject in particular con∣gregations, the legates cooked them up to their own mind; not finishing them till the night before the session, and the Bishops knowing nothing of what was to be passed till it was ready to be pronounced, many of them neither did nor could understand the points determined, and so passed them implicitly, committing such blunders in some cases, that the legates were forced to employ divines to correct decrees after they were passed by the council. All was done (as that ambas∣sador observes) by directions from Rome; and nothing else was to be expected, when a majority of the coun∣cil consisted of the Pope's pensioners."—Notwithstand∣ing this majority of their own creatures, the legates were not a little embarrassed on some occasions. There was nothing they so much dreaded as the coming of Protestants to the council: and, as well to deter them from that step, as to have a pretence for not hearing them, in the explanations and defence of their confes∣sions of faith, they had, in contempt of the remon∣strances of the imperial ambassador, hurried over matters so, as to prejudge them, and to condemn the most material articles of those confessions, which, by wresting them to a perverse sense, they could find a pre∣text to censure. Joachim, Elector of Brandenburgh, had sent his ambassadors to Trent; the Duke of Wir∣temberg did the same; and, at the latter end of the last year, deputies arrived there from Strasburgh, and five other cities of the empire; being followed, in the beginning of this, by ambassadors from Maurice, the
<PB N="156" REF="167"/>new Elector of Saxony. These all demanded a revi∣sion of what had been done with regard to the contro∣verted points, and a safe-conduct for their divines to come and dispute, and defend the doctrines laid down in their own confessions: but the legates, pursuant to their orders from Rome, resolved not to allow them the liberty of a defence, pretending that there would, in that case, be no end of disputes. The instances of the imperial ambassadors, and the ecclesiastical electors of the empire, prevailed indeed for a safe-conduct, but not such a one as the Protestants desired, or thought (after the declaration of the council of Constance, that faith was not to be kept with heretics) a sufficient security for their divines. The legates would not grant one more ample: and, being doubtful whether the form, to which they had consented, might not be ac∣cepted, proposed to finish their decrees in a session or two, and then dissolve the council. This resolution could not be executed, without giving abundant occa∣sion of clamour to the world: but an unexpected event extricated them out of their difficulties, and afforded them a plausible pretence, on April 28, to suspend the council.</P>
<P>This was a war which, at that time, broke out in the empire, on the following occasion. The Emperor, contrary to his word of honour, given to Maurice of Saxony, and the Marquis of Brandenburgh, had de∣tained the Landgrave of Hesse in prison, which had greatly irritated these two Princes: nor could the other potentates and states of the empire see, with patience, the liberties of Germany invaded, and the freedom of religion destroyed. As there was no probable means of procuring a redress of these grievances, but by force, they resolved to take that method: and, making a league with Henry II. King of France, they made preparation for war with all secresy imaginable. Having assembled their forces on a sudden, they came, on April 1, before Augsburgh, and, in two days, made
<PB N="157" REF="168"/>themselves masters of that city. The King of France, having, at the same time, advanced into Lorrain with a strong body, and declaring, that his only design was to assert the liberties of Germany, which the Emperor meant to enslave, found admittance into the cities of Metz, Toul, Verdun, and advanced as far as Strasburgh. Charles V. though averse to an ac∣commodation, was soon obliged to enter into a treaty with the confederates, and consent to the pacification, made at Passau, in the beginning of August. The principal conditions were, "That a diet should be assembled in six months, to consider the most easy and proper means for appeasing all disputes about religion; for which an equal number of pious, prudent, and pa∣cific persons, should be chosen, on both sides; that in the mean time neither the Emperor, nor any other Prince, should force the conscience, or put a constraint on the will of any body, in point of religion, nor, by an act of violence, or under pretence of instruc∣tion, do any thing to the prejudice, or slight, of any person whatsoever on the subject, but suffer all the world to live in peace and tranquillity; that the Princes of the <HI>Augsburgh confession</HI> should not molest the Romish ecclesiastics or seculars, but let them enjoy their estates and revenues, and exercise their jurisdiction and cere∣monies; that the imperial chamber should do justice to to all, without regarding their religion, and the Pro∣testants, having in it the number of seats belonging to them, should, as well as the parties, who had suits in the court, be at liberty to swear by <HI>God and the saints,</HI> or by <HI>God and the Gospels,</HI> at their option; and, in fine, that, if they could come to no agreement in articles of religion, this agreement should still con∣tinue for ever in its full force and vigour." Thus was the <HI>interim</HI> (formerly mentioned) which had only been executed in a very few places, entirely annulled: the Landgrave of Hesse was set at liberty, and all diffe∣rences in Germany with the Emperor terminated.</P>
<PB N="158" REF="169"/>
<P>The war still continuing between the Emperor and France, Charles applied to the court of England for a succour, but in vain. The King had greater reason to be jealous of the Emperor, than of any other power in Europe, his projects for getting the Princess Mary out of England, being calculated neither for Edward's advantage, nor for furthering his designs of reformation in his dominions; for the better carrying on of which, it was very convenient, that he should be at amity with his neighbours; and accordingly the disputes with Scotland, about the debateable lands on the borders, were settled, on September 24, by the Lords Wharton and Conyers, Sir T. Wharton, and Sir T. Chaloner, in conjunction with the Scotch com∣missioners. Thus at peace with all the world, Edward was not diverted from the work he had most at heart: and caused the common prayer to be translated into French, for the use of the isles of Jersey and Guern∣sey. It was probably not so easy to find proper persons capable of translating it either into the Welsh or Irish languages; so that it did not appear in the former, till the 5th of Queen Elizabeth, and, if it hath not been translated since into the latter language, it hath been chiefly owing to the influence the Romish priests still preserve in Ireland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">The reforma∣tion introdu∣ced into Ire∣land.</NOTE> The acts for abolishing the papal supre∣macy and establishing the regal, for suppres∣sing monasteries, levying the twentieths of ecclesiastical preferments, and appointing the order of consecrating Bishops, with some others of the late King's regulations, had passed in the par∣liament of Ireland: but the council of England did not think it prudent, during Edward's minority, to push things farther among a people so tenaciously ad∣dicted to the church of Rome. Their chief concern was, to keep that country quiet: and with an addi∣tional force of 400 men they attained their end sur∣prisingly; there not being any disturbance there during
<PB N="159" REF="170"/>the whole of this reign. Notwithstanding, the English liturgy was carried over thither; and, without any law in their own parliaments to impose it, was used in most churches of the English plantations. John Bale was made Bishop of Ossory, Goodacre primate of Armagh, and other vacant sees filled with persons zealous for the reformation: which continually gained ground among the English, though, for want of instructors, the Irish septs remained in their wonted ignorance.</P>
<P>In England nothing more was done this year, re∣lating to religion, besides the care taken to see the laws lately made duly observed; the deprivation of Bishop Tonstal, on October 11, for misprision of treason; and the promotion of Dr. John Taylor, in June, to the see of Lincoln, after it had been vacant near a year, and stripped by greedy courtiers of all its manors, except that of Bugden in Hunting donshire.</P>
<P>It is said,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The bishopric of Durham divided.</NOTE> that Ridley was named to Durham; and possibly some instrument might pass for that purpose; since, in Queen Mary's reign, advantage was thence taken, to put Bonner into possession of the see of London, with∣out pronouncing any deprivation against Ridley, who yet was afterwards deprived of Durham for heresy and sedition. But, if any patent did pass for his trans∣lation, it never took effect, probably thro' the power of the Duke of Northumberland, who aimed at the rich palatinate belonging to this see; and got an act of parliament, in the next session, to dissolve the bishopric, and erect, in its stead, two dioceses under two Bishops, one retaining the old name of Durham, the other denominated from Newcastle; which, virtually, if not expressly, set aside Ridley's translation. About this time, Thomas Sternhold,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The psalms translated into metre.</NOTE> a groom of the privy-chamber, translated some of the psalms into a barbarous English metre: and the rest being soon after put into verse by John Hopkins and others, in imitation of what had been done
<PB N="160" REF="171"/>abroad by Clement Merot, and Theodore Beza, people fond of foreign customs, began to sing them in their houses. The practice spreading from thence to churches, they sung them there, without any authority or licence, before and after the liturgy and sermon; so that, not interfering with the established worship, it grew into a custom by connivance, and hath so continued without any express allowance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">The King ap∣points the Lady Jane Grey his suc∣cessor.</NOTE> A. D. 1553.] The King felt himself greatly indisposed by a disorder in his lungs, in consequence of the measles and small-pox, with which he had been seized the preced∣ing spring. The cause of his illness was by some imputed to having overheated himself at sports and exercises, during his progress in the former summer; though others, who pretended to have looked more narrowly into the matter, fancied they had ob∣served some sort of decayings in him, from the time Sir Robert Dudley (fourth son of the Duke of Nor∣thumberland) came to attend in ordinary about his person. It was hoped, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Majesty's youth, the approaching spring, and prep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> medicines adapted to his case, might, by degrees, get the better of his ma∣lady: but it was of too malignant a nature; and grew so fast upon him, that, when the parliament met in the beginning of March, the Lords and Commons were obliged to attend him at Whitehall, to hear the reasons of their being convened. Every degree of decay of the King's healti. was a spur to Northumber∣land, in taking measures for carrying on the schemes he had formed for raising his own family to the throne, upon Edward's decease; he was scarce ever absent from the sick Prince; and endeavoured by his assiduity, and pretended concern for his health, to get into his affections, as well as considence, at the same time that he kept all, but his own creatures, at a dis∣tance. —The King, drawing near his end, the weak∣ness of his body, and depression of his spirits by a
<PB N="161" REF="172"/>languishing sickness rendering him susceptible of such impressions, fears, and apprehensions, as Northumber∣land suggested, he was soon persuaded, that he had the same right of settling and altering the succession of the crown, as his father Henry had exercised: and as all that had been done by them both, towards a refor∣mation, would be set aside, if the order settled by Henry's will took place, it was proposed to him to make an alteration therein. The young Monarch had nothing at heart so much, as the establishment of the reformation: it had been the continual object of his pursuit, in the exercise of his regal power, and it was the chief subject of his last prayer at the moment of his decease. The danger of its being destroyed, and of the revival of popery, if the Princess Mary should mount the throne, was too evident to be disputed: and Edward was sufficiently inclined to prevent so fatal a consequence if it might be done with justice; for which, besides the danger of their marrying foreigners, that would destroy the laws and liberties of the nation, other pretences were not wanting. These were such as lay equally against to Princess Elizabeth, though no such danger was apprehended from her: yet, both having once been declared illegitimate, though born <HI>bona fide</HI> in marriage, and afterwards not only capa∣citated to succeed, but actually declared heirs to the crown, in their respective orders, were on that account both to be excluded. It was further urged, that, if these Princesses had been really legitimate, and for that reason natural heirs to their father, yet they were not so to Edward, being his sisters only by the half blood; who, in the case of private inheritance, can∣not, by the law of England, claim the real estates of an half brother, whilst any relations of the whole blood remain, as had appeared in a late instance, upon the decease of the sons of Charles Brandon. Very likely Edward was not conversant enough with the law of nations, and the constitution of the kingdom, to know,
<PB N="162" REF="173"/>that the rule, observed in private patrimonies, was very different from the order established with regard to crowns descending by a lineal succession, in which the next line a heir hath as much right to the succession, as the King in being hath to the possession, of the crown; and was therefore the more easily persuaded, by this pretence, to exclude his half sisters. Henry's will had set aside the Scotch line: and Mary Queen of Scotland, the heir of his sister Margaret, being affianced to the Dauphin, there was room for the same apprehen∣sions on the score of religion from that quarter, as were entertained with regard to the Princess Mary; be∣sides the manifest danger of England's becoming a pro∣vince to the more powerful kingdom of France. All these circumstances concurring to favour Northum∣berland's scheme, no body being suffered to approach Edward, but such as were sure to promote it, and Frances Duchess of Suffolk, the next heir of the line of Mary, younger sister of Henry VIII. devolving all her right upon her eldest daughter, the King was pre∣vailed with to appoint his cousin the Lady Jane Grey his successor. — Sir Edward Montague, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and two other Judges, Sir Thomas Bromley, and Sir John Baker, with the Attorney-General, and Solicitor General, were sent for to the Council, the King being present; and the mi∣nute of the intended settlement of the crown being read, they were ordered to draw it up in the form of a patent. They observed, that the succession being settled by act of parliament, could not be altered in any other manner: and when this objection did not prevent the order's being renewed, they desired time to consider of the matter. Upon examining the statute of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Edward VI. of treasons, they found it to be treason, not only after the King's death, but even in his lifetime, to alter the succession: and, when they came again before the council, declared, it could not be done, because it was treasonable, and all the Lords,
<PB N="163" REF="174"/>that should concur in it, would be guilty of treason. Northumberland was in a violent passion at this decla∣ration; called Montague a traytor, and threatened the other Judges: but they persisted in their opinion. They were sent for again on June 15, and, Gosnold coming with them, the King asked them a little roughly, why they had not prepared the settlement? Upon their ur∣ging, that whatever they did would be of no force with∣out a parliament, the King said he would call one soon: and, when they proposed to delay it till then, he told them, he would have it first drawn, in order afterwards to have it ratified by parliament; and required them upon their allegiance to set about it immediately. They were at last brought to comply, partly by threats, and partly by their being granted, at their request, a special com∣mission to make the draught, and a pardon after it was finished. When the form of the entail was drawn, and brought to the Chancellor (Thomas Goodrich Bishop of Ely) for the great seal, all the judges were required to put their hands to it, and only Gosnold and Sir James Hales refused: the former, however, complied after∣wards, but the latter, though zealous for the reforma∣tion, would not consent to do it, on any consideration. The Chancellor then, for his own security, insisted that all the Lords of the council should likewise set their hands to the instrument; which was accordingly signed on June 21, by thirty-three persons in all, in∣cluding the Judges. Archbishop Cranmer was not there; and when it was proposed to him, refused to sign: nor could any arguments persuade him to the disinheriting of his late master's daughters, till they got the King to conjure him, not to stand out singly against his will, and engage him, upon the opinion of the Judges, that it was legal, to set his hand to it.</P>
<P>Edward had but a short time to live,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The King's mu∣nificence to the city of London.</NOTE> when the great seal was put to this settlement: but, before he died, he had the satisfaction of seeing some charitable founda∣tions, which he had designed for some time, fully
<PB N="164" REF="175"/>settled. Vast swarms of beggars and necessitous people were continually strolling about the streets of London, since the suppression of monasteries: and Bishop Ridley, in a sermon, preached the last year before the King, had earnestly recommended the settling of some con∣stant method for their relief. Edward, much affected with what he had heard, sent for the prelate; gave him thanks for his good exhortation; and, discoursing with him about the proper methods of bringing about so good a work, it was thought adviseable to consult the Lord Mayor and Aldermen on the subject. In consequence hereof, a general contribution was made in the city, towards preparing and furnishing the hospitals of Christ-church, and of St. Thomas in Southwark, the scites whereof, with the lands and the revenues of the dissolved priories of Little St. Bartholomew and St. Thomas, had been given by Henry VIII. before his death, to the city: but nothing had been done to fit them up for the purpose intended. A subscription was now opened for a weekly contribution towards the maintenance of these hospitals, till they should be better endowed: and some of the citizens contributed very generously to both these charitable undertakings. The decayed buildings in both places were thereupon re∣paired; and the work carried on with so much dili∣gence, that, on November 23, a great number of sick and maimed people were taken into St. Thomas's hos∣pital, and no less than 400 children put into Christ's hospital; all of them to be cloathed, lodged, and sub∣sisted, at the charge of the city, till other means could be provided for their future maintenance. The King, delighted with the forward liberality of the citizens, sent for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, on April to, and gave for ever his palace of Bridewell (erected by Henry VIII.) to the city, to be employed for the relief of such vagabonds, and thriftless poor, as should be sent thither to receive chastisement, and be kept to labour. The hospital, founded in the Savoy by Henry VII. for the relief of travellers and pilgrims, had
<PB N="165" REF="176"/>of late been made a harbour for idle fellows, vaga∣bonds and strumpets: and the master and brethren, being thereupon sent for to the King, were persuaded to resign it into his hands, with all its goods, lands and revenues. His Majesty, immediately upon this sur∣render, assigned a yearly rent 7000 marks, with the beds, bedding, and other furniture, towards the maintenance of the work-house of Bridewell, and the hospital of St. Thomas. The letters-patent confirm∣ing this grant, with a licence of <HI>mortmain,</HI> for enabling the city to purchase lands to the amount of 4000 marks a-year, for the support of those and other hos∣pitals, were passed on June 26.</P>
<P>Some people observed, that,<NOTE PLACE="inter">King Ed∣ward's death.</NOTE> after the settlement of the succession, Edward de∣cayed more visibly than he did before. A woman, who could give no account of the nature of the dis∣temper, nor would declare the means she proposed to use, undertook to restore him, in a very short time, to his former health: and the physicians were, by Nor∣thumberland's advice, and an order of council, dis∣charged, till she had tried the effects of her medicines. The use of them soon brought upon the King a difficulty of speech and breathing; his legs swelled, his pulse failed, and his skin changed colour, with many other horrid symptoms of approaching death. This being observed, the physicians were sent for again, when it was too late, being called in purely for form sake, that it might not be said, a King had died without the attendance of his physicians: and some of them whispered in secret, "that neither their advice nor applications had been at all regarded, in the course of his sickness; that he had been ill-treated several times; and when, by the bene∣fit of youth, and the effect of proper medecines, there was fair hopes of his recovery. he was again more strongly overlaid than ever." Such sudden turns often happen in consumptive cases: and yet Dr. Heylin quotes a popish writer, affirming, that the apothecary,
<PB N="166" REF="177"/>who poisoned him, drowned himself soon after, out of the horror of his crime, and the remorse of his con∣science; and that the laundress, who washed his shirts, lost the skin of her fingers. However this was (and, if Edward had been poisoned, some mark of it must have appeared, when his body was opened to be em∣balmed) the people in general imputed his death to the Duke of Northumberland, and broke out into most violent exclamations against him; maintaining, that it had been his view, in getting the King's two uncles put to death, in disgracing, and removing from court, the most faithful of his nobility and council, and placing about his person such as were ready to perpetrate any wickedness that they should be desired to commit. Northumberland, slighting these clamours, proceeded in his measures for securing the crown to his own fa∣mily; but, as Providence often infatuates the most crafty politicians, he took the most important of them too late for his purpose. This was the getting of the two rightful heirs into his hands; for having engaged the King or the Lords of the council in his name, to write a letter to his sisters, inviting them to court, to bear him company during his illness, they began their journeys; but, before their arrival, Edward died at Greenwich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His corpse remained there till August 8; and, being then removed to Westminster, was buried the next day in the abbey-church; the Marquis of Winchester, Lord Treasurer, attending it as chief mourner, with twelve other mourners, six of them Earls, and six Barons. Day, the late Bishop of Chichester, preached the funeral-sermon: but the burial-service was read in English by Archbishop Cranmer, who, at the same time, administered the communion. At this mournful so∣lemity, to which no ambassador was invited, and few of the nobility attended, an universal dejection prevailed, and such tokens of real grief were expressed by all ranks of people, as had scarce ever been known on the like occasion.</NOTE>, on July 6, towards night, in the six∣teenth year of his age, and the seventh of his reign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">His cha∣racter.</NOTE> Edward VI is celebrated by historians for the beauty of his person, the sweetness of
<PB N="167" REF="178"/>his temper, quickness of apprehension, and an ad∣mirable understanding, cultivated and improved by study and reflection to an amazing degree. His favour to men of learning is universally acknowledged: one of the most eminent of that age, Jerome Cardan, an Italian physician and a Roman Catholic, who, in his return from Scotland, passed some time in the English court, the year before Edward's death, and conversed frequently with him on matters of science, gives him a character, which in an English writer might look like flattery or prepossession. "There was in him (says Jerome) a towardly disposition and pregnancy, qualifying him for all human literature, so that, whilst a child, he was master of several languages, besides his native English. He was singularly perfect in the French and Latin tongues; and understood the Greek, Italian, and Spanish, having the like facility for re∣ceiving all others: nor was he unskilled in music, lo∣gic, and the principles of natural philosophy. He did not want either humanity, princely gravity and majesty, or any other accomplishment becoming a noble King. In a word, it might seem a miracle in na∣ture to behold the excellent wit and genius that ap∣peared in him, being yet a child: and this (says he) I do not speak rhetorically to magnify matters beyond the truth, for the truth really surpasses what I here declare" He was assiduous to inform himself of every thing that concerned the commerce and interest of his country, and understood foreign affairs very well, con∣sidering his years. He made useful regulations for the dispatch of business in his council, and kept a jour∣nal of all that passed in it. He was very careful to pay his debts, and maintain his credit; and would, in all probability, have made an excellent oeconomist, if he had lived to take the reins of government into his own hands. Notwithstanding these great qualities, his Majesty seems to have had an ingredient of bigotry, that would have rendered him very troublesome to
<PB N="168" REF="179"/>those of tender consciences, who might have happened to differ from him in religious principles. Neither can his consenting to the death of his uncle, who had served him faithfully, be reconciled to his boasted hu∣manity and penetration, unless we charitably ascribe it, with some authors, to an inflexible regard for what he thought justice; or conclude that he wanted reso∣lution to withstand the importunities of his minister, and that he was deficient in that vigour of mind, which often exists independent of literature and ac∣quired talents.</P>

<P>A. D. 1553 THE Duke of Northumberland endea∣voured to conceal the death of Edward VI. in hopes of getting the two disinherited Princesses into his hands, and in order to take effectual measures for publishing the late King's will, and settling the Lady Jane Grey on the throne, without disturbance. But as it was known by all the Lords of the council (some whereof were ill-affected to the Duke, though they had crouch∣ed under his power) it could not be long a secret to the world: and the melancholy event began in two days to be whispered about London. The Duke then thought it necessary to send for the Lord Mayor, six Aldermen, and twelve of the principal citizens to
<PB N="169" REF="180"/>Greenwich, to acquaint them with his Majesty's de∣cease, and the will he had made for settling the suc∣cession. The patent under the great seal, containing the disposition in favour of the Lady Jane, was shewed them: and, after being obliged by promises and threats to take the oaths to her, they were strictly charged, un∣der severe penalties, not to divulge the matter. Jane was at Sion house, in Middlesex, when Northumber∣land, Northampton, Arundel, Hunting∣don,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Lady Jane Grey pro∣claimed.</NOTE> and Pembroke, approached her on their knees, with such marks of respect and ceremony, as threw her into the greatest astonishment. When she was acquainted with her de∣signation to the throne, she burst into a flood of tears; nor could all the intreaties of her friends, parents, re∣lations, and husband, prevail with her, for some time, to accept the proffered crown. Her consent being at last extorted, she was conducted, on July 10, to the Tower of London; presented in form with the keys at her entrance, and proclaimed Queen, that evening, in different parts of the city. The Princess Mary had come as far as Hoddesdon in Hertsordshire, when she received a message from Henry Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, informing her of the King's death, and the steps taken to exclude her from the succession. She immediately retired to Kenning-hall in Norfolk, and wrote thence, on July 8, to Sir George Somerset, Sir W. Drury, Sir W. Waldegrave, and Clement Hig∣ham, requiring their immediate attendance, with what forces they could raise. Circular letters were dispatch∣ed to all the nobility and magistrates of the principal towns, putting them in mind of her right, and com∣manding them to proclaim her without delay. Then she wrote to the council, expressing her surprise, that, as they knew her undoubted right to the crown, they had not informed her of her brother's demise; and pro∣mising to take them into favour, upon recognizing her title, and proclaiming her in London, and other
<PB N="170" REF="181"/>places, according to their duty. Having taken these measures, she removed to Framlingham castle in Suf∣folk, that, in case of being hard pressed, she might be near the sea to make her escape to Flanders. The first noblemen who joined her were John Bourchier Earl of Bath, and Henry Ratcliffe Earl of Sussex; Sir T. Wharton, Sir J. Mordaunt, Sir H. Bidingfield, Sir W. Drury, and other gentlemen of figure, joining them, made up a force, which began to be formidable. The council at London sent an answer to her letter, im∣porting, that as she was the fruit of an unlawful mar∣riage, formally dissolved by act of parliament, she ought to drop her pretensions, and acknowledge the sovereignty of Queen Jane, who had mounted the throne by virtue of the late King's letters-patent: and having received advice of the unexpected event in fa∣vour of Mary, on July 12, ordered the forces, which they had in readiness, to march to Newmarket, under the command of the Duke of Northumberland. The hopes of being able to do something, in Dudley's ab∣sence, in favour of Mary, made some of the Lords prevail on him to accept the command; and, though he complied, it was not without some jealousy of their designs. However, before he set out, he instructed the Duke of Suffolk to detain the counsellors in the Tower, on pretence of conforming to the practice of the English sovereigns, who, with their council, used to reside there, on their accession to the throne.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Princess Mary was pro∣claimed at Norwich,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen Mary proclaimed in the country,</NOTE> which city sent a body of men, with ammunition, to her assistance: and she had been reinforced by the Lord Thomas Howard, son to the Duke of Norlolk, with the friends and followers of the Howard family, very numerous in that country. Upon the first news of Northumberland's march, Mary was advised, by some about her, to retire a∣broad;
<PB N="171" REF="182"/>and had he advanced immediately against her, she might probably have taken that step; in which case she would hardly have found friends to introduce her back to England. Instead of acting with the ne∣cessary vigour, resolution, and dispatch, he loitered away his time some days at Cambridge; and, not find∣ing the supplies he expected from the council on his arrival at Bury, he retired back to that place. He was now under a necessity of waiting for succours from London; and he wrote to the council in the most pressing terms for a reinforcement: but, though they offered eight crowns a month, besides subsistence, to every volunteer that would inlist, such was the general odium against Northumberland, that few would en∣gage, even on these terms; while people crowded to the banners of Mary, and maintained themselves at their own expence; insomuch that her army soon amounted to 14,000 men, and many assisted her with money, plate, and jewels.</P>
<P>The time was favourable for the Earls of Pembroke and Arundel,<NOTE PLACE="inter">and in London.</NOTE> and the other enemies of North∣umberland, to take measures for his destruction. The two Earls, finding themselves restricted and watched by Suffolk, took an opportunity, from the Duke of Northumberland's pressing letters, to pro∣pose, that, as the French ambassador was averse to enter the Tower, they should meet him at Baynard's castle, a house belonging to the Earl of Pembroke in the city, where they might confer with him, and con∣cert measures for bringing over a body of troops for the service of Jane. Suffolk assenting, they invited to the place all the noblemen about London who were thought to be in Mary's interest: and when they met, the Earl of Arundel made a speech, inveighing bitterly against Northumberland, and his designs, in the ex∣altation of Jane, which, he affirmed, was only to serve his own private views, though shamefully cloathed with the specious pretence of religion: and moved, that Mary
<PB N="172" REF="183"/>might be proclaimed Queen of England. Arundel's harangue was no sooner finisned, than Pembroke de∣clared his approbation of the motion: and, clapping his hand upon his sword, signified his resolution to de∣fend the Lady Mary's cause against all opponents. Some of the Lords proposed, their first advertising the Duke of Northumberland, whom they had all engaged to support, and to treat in common for a pardon: but, a majority being against all delays, a proclamation was drawn up and signed by all present. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen, being acquainted with the re∣solution, came and joined them; and the whole body, mounted on horseback rode through St. Paul's church∣yard to the cross in Cheapside, where Mary was pro∣claimed Queen, by Sir Christopher Barker, principal King at arms, on July 19, about four in the after∣noon. The Earl of Arundel and Lord Paget were dispatched to Framlingham castle, to acquaint her Majesty with these proceedings: and some companies were sent to secure the Tower, which was the easier done, as Pembroke had 150 of the guards at his de∣votion. Jane resigned the parade of royalty, with more satisfaction than she had received it: and retired, with her mother, to their own habitations. The Duke of Suffolk, joining the other Lords, with Arch∣bishop Cranmer, Chancellor Goodrich, the Marquis of Winchester, and the rest of the council, sent in∣structions to the Duke of Northumberland, to disband his forces, and behave like a dutisul subject.</P>
<P>Some private friends having informed him of these proceedings at London, the Duke had dismissed his forces, then reduced to a small number by desertion, and intended to quit the kingdom: but being prevented by the band of pensioners, who insisted upon his stay∣ing to justify their proceedings, he endeavoured to re∣commend himself to Mary, by proclaiming her Queen at the market-place in Cambridge, on July 20, when he threw up his cap in token of joy, and shewed other
<PB N="173" REF="184"/>feigned demonstrations of his zeal. The Earl of Arundel arriving next morning, and arresting him in the Queen's name, he fell down at his feet, and abjectly sued for his favour; but was treated by him, with a retaliation of the pride and insolence Arundel had formerly re∣ceived from him. On July 25, he was committed to the Tower<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the way thither a woman shewed him a handkerchief which she had dipped in the blood of the Duke of Somerset; and up∣braided him as being the cause of that nobleman's ruin.</NOTE>, with the Earls of Warwick and Hun∣tingdon, the Lords Hastings, Ambrose and Henry Dudley, Sir Andrew Dudley, Sir John and Sir Henry Gates, Sir T. Palmer<NOTE N="|" PLACE="foot">See page 141 of this volume.</NOTE>, and Dr. Sandys Vice-chan∣cellor of Cambridge. These were followed the next day by the Marquis of Northampton, the Lord Ro∣bert Dudley, Sir Robert Corbet, and Bishop Ridley; the offence of this last being a sermon which he preach∣ed, on the 16th, at St. Paul's cross, maintaining Jane's title to the crown, according to the late King's settlement, and setting forth Mary's obstinacy in ad∣hering to the Romish superstitions, with the mischiefs her accession must bring on the nation, by subjecting it to a foreign power, and subverting the true reli∣gion.</P>
<P>Upon the revolution at London, and the disaster of Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Mary enters London in triumph.</NOTE> Mary disbanded her army at Framlingham, and began her march to London, which she entered in triumph, on August 3, attended by her sister Elizabeth, who had joined her on the road with 1000 horse raised for her service. She proceeded im∣mediately to the Tower, and soon after her arrival there set at liberty the Duke of Norfolk, the Duchess of Somerset, and other state-prisoners, ecclesiastics and laics. Thus Mary became mistress of the realm with∣out a drop of blood, notwithstanding her rival had
<PB N="174" REF="185"/>been possessed of the forts, the magazines, the trea∣sure, the civil power, the navy, and the regular mi∣litary force of the realm: from whence Bishop Good∣win takes occasion to celebrate the attachment of the English to the heir of blood, in opposition to an usur∣ped authority. As the Londoners had been very zea∣lous in Mary's cause, she distributed 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> a piece to every poor house-keeper among them. On Aug. 20, she issued a proclamation touching a redress of the in∣conveniences arising from the currency of bad money: and another, on Sept. 1, remitting a subsidy of 4 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> in the pound on lands, and 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> on goods, payable in two years, granted to the late King by his last par∣liament.</P>
<P>The Duke of Northumberland had been the au∣thor, contriver,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Duke of Nortlum∣berland condemned, and beheaded.</NOTE> and abetter, of the late usurpation: and as he well∣deserved death on that account, he was too dangerous a man to be suffered to live under a Queen, who knew that her measures would soon create a general discontent among the people. Being brought to his trial, on Aug. 18, the Duke of Norfolk acting as High Steward, he de∣sired to know, whether a man, acting by orders under the great seal, could be justly charged with treason? and whether those, who were at least equally culpable, could sit as judges? Norfolk replied, that the great seal of an usurper could be no warrant; and that any person, against whom there was nothing upon record, was reputed in law capable of sitting on any trial. From this last answer, Northumberland foresaw that any ob∣jection he could make would be over-ruled; he there∣fore confessed the indictment, and threw himself on the Queen's mercy; for which he also petitioned his judges to be mediators with her Majesty to his sons, who had taken arms in obedience to his command. The Marquis of Northampton, and the Earl of Warwick (the Duke's eldest son) being arraigned at the same time,
<PB N="175" REF="186"/>pleaded guilty; and all three received sentence, as in cases of high treason. The same judgment was pro∣hounced, the next day, upon Sir John and Sir Henry Gates, Sir Andrew Dudley the Duke's brother, and Sir T. Palmer; who all pleading guilty, submitted to the Queen's mercy. On Tuesday, August 22, Nor∣thumberland was brought to the scaffold on Tower-hill, where he acknowledged that he had been always a Roman Catholic in his heart, and expressed great sor∣row for having plundered the effects of the church, especially as he had it not in his power to make resti∣tution. He is said to have been amused with a pro∣mise of pardon, in consequence of which he made this confession, which the Romanists published abroad with great exultation. With him Sir John Gates and Sir T. Palmer were brought to the block, the rest of them being reprieved, and afterwards pardoned.</P>
<P>The noblemen, who had signalized themselves in the Queen's behalf,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Queen rewards some of her friends.</NOTE> expected ber re∣compensing their service: nor was she unmindful of some of them. The Earl of Arundel was constituted steward of the house∣hold. The Earl of Sussex was created Knight of the Garter, having also a privilege granted him, for being, after the Spanish fashion, covered in her pre∣sence; and the Lord Paget was, in a very honourable manner, restored to the same order, of which he had been deprived in the former reign by Northumber∣land's means. Sir Edward Hastings was made Master of the Horse, had a grant of the manors of Bosworth in Leicestershire, and of Michelcherke in Somerset; and was afterwards advanced to the title of Lord Ha∣stings of Loughborough. Sir Henry Jernegan was appointed captain of the guard; and Sir Thomas Tresham was created Lord Prior of the order of St. John of Jerusalem, which was now revived<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 19 of this volume.</NOTE>. Seve∣ral
<PB N="176" REF="187"/>others were rewarded, at the same time, with pla∣ces and pensions; but it doth not appear that any re∣wards were given to the Earl of Bath, Sir John Mor∣daunt, or Sir Thomas Wharton, though they were the first noblemen that joined her. The worst cir∣cumstance in the choice of her great officers and coun∣cil was, that scarce any of them were eminent for ta∣lents to qualify them for affairs of government; which, through that defect, fell entirely under the manage∣ment of Gardiner (who was now released from his confinement) and Paget. Gardiner having the great seal delivered to him on August 23, was, on Septem∣ber 26, created Lord Chancellor, and shewed himself full as arrogant and violent in his administration as the most arbitrary of his predecessors in power.</P>
<P>A change of the present establishment of religious affairs was what Mary pretended to have most at heart;<NOTE PLACE="inter">She deprives Bi∣shops by her own authority.</NOTE> and, to allure the Bishops to come into her measures, she had declared her resolution of restoring all the lands and manors which had been taken away from their sees. Some of them, flattered with the expectation, complied: but as there was little hopes of prevailing with the major part, more violent methods were to be taken with such as adhered firmly to the Reformation. Bonner was, on August 5, reinstated in the see of London, and took possession of the Bishop's palace, exercised the episcopal authority, and, on the 27th of that month, revived the mass, and all the Roman La∣tin offices, in his cathedral. This was done on the pretence of the see's being vacant by Ridley's transla∣tion to Durham, though no patent had ever passed for his translation; and he had in June, a little before <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d∣ward's death, sent, as Bishop of London, and Dean of the province, the Archbishop's writ to the other Bishops for summoning a convocation to meet in Sep∣tember, concurrent with a parliament, which was to have convened at the same time, to confirm that
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>Prince's settlement of the succession. The bishopric of Durham was dissolved by act of parliament; and the supposition that it was filled by Ridley (whom on other occasions they stile Bishop of Rochester) served for a pretence to restore Tonstal to it, upon the other's deprivation for heresy and sedition, as is mentioned in the register. But these seem to have been pretences found out afterwards to gloss over what had been done irregularly at first; for all writers agree, that both Bonner and Tonstal were put in possession of their sees on August 5; and the commission of delegates for hearing the former's new appeal (that which he had made in the late reign having been pronounced insuf∣ficient) did not bear date till the 22d of that month, and sentence was not given on it till the beginning of September; that for rehearing Tonstal's cause is not dated. Hooper was actually Bishop of Worcester, as Poynet was of Winchester, and Scory of Chichester; yet, without any legal process, or deprivation of the parties, Heath, Gardiner, and Day, were immedi∣ately restored to those sees; as Vesey was, on Septem∣ber 28, to that of Exeter, which he, being 87 years old, had formerly resigned.</P>
<P>Thornden, sub-dean of Canterbury, had caused mass to be said in the cathedral there;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Archbishop Cran∣mer, and other pre∣lates, imprisoned.</NOTE> and Archbishop Cranmer being falsely charged, by common report, of ei∣ther ordering or consenting to it, to vindicate himself from a calumny which might have an ill effect on the professors of the reformed religion, drew up a decla∣ration, in which he offered, with P. Martyr (who had been aspersed as unlearned) and a few others, whom he would chuse, to defend, in a public disputation, the liturgy, doctrines, and every part of the reforma∣tion under the late King, as agreeable to those of the primitive church, and warranted by the holy scriptures. He proposed to enlarge, and put his own seal to it,
<PB N="178" REF="189"/>and then to have it fixed on the doors of St. Paul's, and other churches in London: but a foul draught<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was to this purport.— "As the devil is a liar, and the father of lying, so he has now stirred up his servants to persecute Christ and his true religion. That whereas the great abuses of the <HI>Latin masses</HI> had been reformed in the two late reigns, and the ser∣vice in holy supper performed agreeably to the institution of our Sa∣viour, and the practice of the apostles; so now the devil endeavours to restore the Latin sati factory masses, a thing of his own invention and device. To bring this more easily about, some people have abused my name, and spread a story, as if I had set up the mass at Canterbury, and that I bad offered to say mass before the Queen at St. Paul's, and elsewhere.
<P>The Archbishop denies the fact, protests against every part of the story; as a downright calumny, and, with the Queen's leave, offers to justify the English communion-service, both from the authority of the Scriptures, and the practice of the primitive church; and, on the other side, that the mass is not only without foundation in both these respects, but likewise discovers a plain contradiction to anti∣quity and the inspired writings, and is stuffad over and above with many horrid blasphemies. And where is Peter Marty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had been ma∣liciously charged with ignorance by some people, the Archbishop, with the Queen's leave, undertakes that this divine, himself, and four or five more of his chasing, will maintrin the <HI>Reformation</HI> made in the late reign, with respect to doctrine, discipline, and worship, to be more orthodox and defensible, more agreeable to the true stan∣dard and primitive plan, than the belief and practice of the church of Rome. The conditions required by the Archbishop, in the dis∣pute, are there. That God's word may be the judge, and that the arguments on both sides may be put in writing; that the world may examine the force of what is alledged, and that neither party may have an opportunity of denying their assertions."</P></NOTE> thereof getting abroad, some of the copies of it were brought to the council; by whose order he was, on September 14, committed prisoner to the Tower. As he had been himself remarkable for doing beneficent offices for divers persons in distress, he found some friends in his own; and several of the most moderate in the council thought it would be punishment suffi∣cient to deprive him of his see, and assign him a com∣petent maintenance, upon his exhibiting a true inven∣tory of all his estate, with an injunction to keep his house, without meddling in matters of religion. He
<PB N="179" REF="190"/>had interposed, even in the Queen's behalf, with her father, to mitigate his anger, when he was proceeding to extremities against her for adhering obstinately to her mother; and neither the Duke of Norfolk, nor Gardiner, nor any one else, durst speak to him to save her from being sent to the Tower: but she could ne∣ver forgive him the divorce of her mother; and was confirmed in these implacable sentiments by Gardiner and Bonner, who yet had gone greater lengths than he, in every part of the prosecution of that affair, ex∣cept only in pronouncing the sentence. Nothing but his death would appease her resentment: but there was some difficulty to determine, upon what capital crime he should be condemned. It seemed hard to charge him with signing the settlement, which ex∣cluded the Queen from the succession, as he was the last person that signed it; and the council would not care to make that a capital crime in him, of which they had been all at least equally guilty. The sangui∣nary laws of Henry IV. and V. against heretics, and the statute of the six articles under Henry VIII. had been repealed; and, in defect of any other means, it was resolved to convict him first of treason, and then keep him in prison, till the laws against heresy were revived, when he might be prosecuted and burnt upon that account. To pave the way for his trial, Gardi∣ner, who had the penning of all the acts that passed in the approaching session of parliament, thrust into two of them certain clauses, charging the Archbishop with being the chief conspirator, with the Duke of Northum∣berland, in contriving the Queen's exclusion, though every body knew the contrary. Accordingly, on No∣vember 13, Cranmer was tried and condemned of trea∣son, with the Lady Jane, and her husband Lord Guil∣ford Dudley, with his brother Lord Ambrose; and the see of Canterbury becoming vacant by his attain∣der, the Dean and Chapter assumed the administration of its spiritualities, as usual in other vacancies. Hol∣gate,
<PB N="180" REF="191"/>Archbishop of York, had not been concerned in any of the transactions relating to the succession; but he was committed, on October 4, to the Tower, tho' it doth not appear upon what pretence he was impri∣soned. He was deprived, in March following, for being married, and detained in custody till January 18, 1555, when he was set at liberty at King Philip's in∣tercession; about a year after which he died, as is supposed, of grief, his houses having been plundered, during his confinement, to the amount of several thou∣sand pounds in money, plate, jewels, stores, and fur∣niture, and even the manor of Scroby seized, which he had bought of the crown, and settled, after his own and wife's decease, upon the see of York.</P>
<P>Such of the deans, dignitaries, and parochial cler∣gy, as had been deprived by law,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The reformed cler∣gy deprived.</NOTE> in the late reign, for non-conformity, were again restored to their benefices, and the legal proprietors expelled by force, under co∣lour of the Queen's authority, without any legal pro∣ceedings. Dr. Cox, Dean of Christ church in Ox∣ford, and of Westminster, was turned out to make room for Dr. Richard Marshall, who succeeded him in the former, and Dr. Hugh Weston, who supplant∣ed him in the latter dignity. Thus the Queen, in the month of October alone, presented 256 livings, not above one whereof appears to have been vacant by death: and it is not unlikely that private persons fol∣lowed her example. The laws against the mass and Roman offices were still in force; but no body could make their court to the government more effectually, than by reviving these forbidden services; and great encouragement was given to this irregularity. On Friday, August 11, a priest singing mass in a church in the horse-market at London, a great disturbance ensued; and the Lord Mayor complaining thereof, and telling the Queen, that greater tumults would arise, if a stop was not put to that illegal practice, she resent∣ed
<PB N="181" REF="192"/>it highly. The priest, indeed, to quiet matters, was taken up, though dismissed immediately; and the Queen next day declared in council, "that, though in her own conscience she was fully satisfied in matters of religion, yet she did not intend to compel or restrain any man's, otherwise than as they should be persua∣ded of the truth, upon hearing the word of God ex∣plained by learned preachers," <HI>i. e.</HI> such as should be licensed by her authority; which, on the 29th of that month, she committed to Gardiner, Bishop of Win∣chester, silencing all that he did not think proper to licence. On Sunday, August 13, the day after this declaration, Bourne, one of Bonner's chaplains, preach∣ing at St. Paul's cross, declaimed against the late King's proceedings in matters of religion; which so incensed the people, that a tumult arose, stones were thrown at him, and a dagger, which, missing him narrowly, stuck in a post of the pulpit. More mis∣chief would have ensued, if the tumult had not been appeased by Rogers and Bradford, two Protestant di∣vines, who carried off the preacher, but were impri∣soned themselves for their popularity. This riot pro∣duced an order of council to the Lord Mayor and Al∣men for calling a common-council, and obliging all children and apprentices to keep their own parish∣churches on holidays, and not attempt any thing to the breach of the common peace: and on the Sunday following, besides several lords of the council, the magistrates, and companies of the city, who attended at divine service, Sir H. Jernegan was sent with 200 of the guards to secure Dr Watson the preacher.</P>
<P>It was now extremely palpable how much the Queen had the Romish religion at heart;<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Queen issues a proclamation concerning reli∣gion.</NOTE> and that, as the people in general were so averse to it, she could not establish it without some disturbance: and the ferment ran so high in London, as to occasion its be∣ing given out publickly, that 20,000 men would lose
<PB N="182" REF="193"/>their lives, before they would suffer an alteration. To allay it in some measure, a proclamation was is∣sued on August 18; in which, after taking notice of the inconveniences and dangers which the realm had suffered formerly through diversity of opinions in que∣stions of religion, and of the same contentions being revived by false reports, her Majesty declared, that she would not hide, but observe and maintain for herself, during her reign, that religion which she had always professed, and desired all her subjects quietly to enter∣tain; signifying, however, that she would not com∣pel any of them thereunto, <HI>till farther order should be taken therein by common consent.</HI> In the mean while, she forbade all her subjects, of all degrees, to move sedi∣tions, or stir unquietness in her people, by interpreting the laws of the land after their own fantasies, but to continue quiet, till such further order was taken; charging them to live together in Christian charity, and to leave off these new-founded devilish terms of <HI>Papist</HI> and <HI>heretic,</HI> and threatening to punish all that should rashly presume to make any assemblies of peo∣ple, or should therein attempt to stir them to disquiet and disorder. Imputing afterwards the spreading of false rumours and sedition, as well to the subtlety and malice of some evil-disposed persons, taking upon them, without sufficient authority, to reproach and in∣terpret the word of God after their own brains, in churches and other places, both in public and private, as to the playing of interludes, and printing of false books, ballads, rhymes, and other lewd treatises, in the English tongue, containing doctrine in the present controversies about the mysteries of the Christian reli∣gion; she forbade all persons to preach, or, by way of reading in churches, or other public or private places, except in schools of the universities, to interpret or teach any scriptures or doctrines touching religion, or to act any interludes, or to print any such book, bal∣lad, rhyme, or treatise, without her special licence."</P>
<PB N="183" REF="194"/>
<P>It is plain, that whatever moderation is couched in this artful proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="inter">She encourages Popery.</NOTE> it was only in∣tended to lull the people asleep till the Queen was crowned, and could carry her point in parliament. Sir James Hales, the only one of the judges that refused to sign King Edward's settle∣ment for her exclusion, telling the justices of the peace, at a quarter sessions in Kent, that the laws of the late King were still in force, and that they ought to see them duly executed, and not suffer them to be transgressed, was taken up on this account, and committed to the King's Bench prison. He was a conscientious man, and very zealous for the Reformation; but, being ter∣rified by threats during his confinement, was persua∣ded by Day to a compliance, which he soon repented; and being disturbed in mind, attempted his own life, next day, by cutting his throat with a penknife. Upon this submission he was set at liberty, and retired to his house in Kent; but without any enjoyment of life, or perfect recovery of his senses: and finding an opportunity too convenient, one day, of getting abroad undiscovered, drowned himself. Every body, that ad∣hered to the laws, had a mark of displeasure set upon them; and nothing was so agreeable to Mary, as the breach of them by setting up the mass, the Latin ser∣vice, and processions, the pageants of saints, and the Roman usates, the practice being recommended by the courtly name of setting forward <HI>the Queen's pro∣ceedings,</HI> and orders given in the articles of archidiaco∣nical visitations, for the presenting of such as gave them any obstruction. The <HI>Suffolk Protestants,</HI> alarmed at these proceedings, addressed her on the subject: but were told, "That members must obey their head, and not expect to rule it:" and Mr. Dobbs, presuming to put her in mind of the promises she had made them with regard to religion, was set in the pillory for three days together. They had served her in her greatest distress, and being the first that joined her, laid the founda∣tion
<PB N="184" REF="195"/>of that power, which, afterwards, persecuted them like others with fire and faggot; an ingratitude, as much owing to the pride of her heart, as to her bigotry in religion The Lord Chief Justice Montague had sent his son, with twenty men, to her standard in Suffolk; but this did not excuse him from being turned out of his office, from six weeks imprisonment, and from being fined, with Judge Bromley, 7000 pounds sterling for their offences in obeying the late King's commands in drawing his settlement. She resolved to lay the like fines upon all that had been in arms against her: a way indeed of raising a good deal of money, but likely also to create her abundance of enemies.</P>
<P>As the success of all her measures depended entirely upon the compliance of the approaching par∣liament,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings in parlia∣ment.</NOTE> all manner of illegal and arbitrary practices had been used to get an house of Commons returned to her purpose. Beele, who was clerk of the council under Queen Elizabeth, says, "that, in many places of the country, men were chosen by force and menaces; that, in others, the agents for the court made use of violence to hinder the commons from coming to an election; that false re∣turns were made in many places, and some members, after being elected and returned, were violently thrust out of the house of Commons:" which was the case of all that were suspected of favouring the reforma∣tion. A great many people had some way or other, during Jane's short usurpation, rendered themselves obnoxious to the government, which could easily sind pretences to harass them: but, notwithstanding this disadvantage, and the violences here mentioned, the Queen was not a little apprehensive of miscarrying in the point she aimed at, unless she could prevail with her sister to conform to her religion. An opposition to her measures, by the next heir to the crown, could not but give spirit to an opposition in parliament, and
<PB N="185" REF="196"/>deter persons from consenting to alterations in reli∣gion, which, in a short time, they might be obliged to repeal. The Queen, from the time of their first meeting, had laboured to bring the Princess over to her own way of thinking in matters of religion: and had renewed her persuasions during all the month of August; but without success. In the beginning of September, she set all the Lords of the council, one after another, for two days together, to talk with her sister on the subject: but this teazing of her proved fruitless, and provoked the Princess at last to give them rough answers, as she knew, that, by acknow∣ledging the authority of the Roman Pontiff, she would of course own her mother's marriage insuffi∣cient. Mary, who would allow firmness and resolu∣tion in no body but herself, had thoughts of sending her to the Tower, removing her servants, and putting others about her; imagining that she was confirmed in her non-compliance by some great men, that in∣tended an opposition in parliament: but this was too dangerous a step to be taken till the business of the session was over. It was necessary, however, to ex∣tort from her at any rate a compliance, before the parliament met: and such means were used, that, at the latter end of the month, the Princess consented to go to mass with her sister; doing so perhaps with as little regard to it, as she expressed afterwards to some Dutch deputies, who complaining to her of their be∣ing forced by the King of Spain to go to mass, she asked them, "why they could not go thither as to a farce, tho' they could not assist at it as a matter of re∣ligion?"</P>
<P>However, Elizabeth's going to mass disheartening all that meditated an opposition, the Queen carried most of her points, in the parliament, which met on Thursday, October 5, with little difficulty. The chief of these was, the limiting of all treasons to the statute of 25 Edward III. but, to prevent its being
<PB N="186" REF="197"/>of service to any she had a mind to prosecute, either for religion, or any other pretences, it was clogged with an exception of all persons, that were either im∣prisoned, confined in their own or other houses, out∣lawed, or attainted for treason, or misprision of treason, before September 30 last past, or excepted out of the pardon granted at her coronation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This solemnity was performed by Stephen Gardiner Bishop of Winchester, on Sunday, October 1, and from the benefit of the am∣nesty then published were excepted the state-prisoners in the Tower or Fleet, 60 persons mentioned by name, and divers others.</NOTE>. Felonies were like∣wise reduced to such offences, as had been deemed so before the accession of Henry VIII. and thus a provision was made for Cardinal Pole's<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See an account of him in vol. ii. page 475, and page 6 of this.</NOTE> exercise of the office of legate (in which quality he was soon ex∣pected in England) without involving himself or the the clergy, as Wolsey had done, in the penalties of a premunire. The spiritual estate in this parliament was composed of the six prelates, lately restored; the re∣formed prelates being most of them in prison; and John Harley Bishop of Hereford, with John Taylor of Lincoln, who going out, when mass was said con∣trary to law, were therefore excluded from their seats. Alexander Nowel (afterwards Dean of St. Paul's) re∣turned burgess for Loo in Cornwall, was turned out of the House of Commons, because, being a preben∣dary of Westminster, he had, as such, a seat in the convocation. Whether he was the chapter's represen∣tative in this body (which, after Weston's intrusion into the deanery, doth not seem probable) or whether it was owing to his affection for the reformation, a difference was made between him and Dr. Tregonwell, who was a main instrument in the removal of the Pro∣testant Bishops, and, though likewise a prebendary of the same church, continued to sit, as Sir Thomas Haxey<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See note, page 81 of this volume.</NOTE>, and other clergymen, had formerly done, in the House
<PB N="187" REF="198"/>of Commons. The subsidy of tonnage and poundage for her Majesty's lise was brought in: and two acts passed for the restitution in blood of Edward Earl of Devon, son of Henry Courrenay Marquis of Exeter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 6 of this volume.</NOTE>, and of his mother Gertrude. Three of the above∣mentioned bills being considered as acts of grace, the Queen would not intermix other matters with them in the same session; for which reason the tonnage bill was deferred, and the parliament prorogued, to Tues∣day, October 24, when the second session began.—The marriage of Henry VIII. with Catherine, the Queen's mother, was declared to be lawful, by the first act which passed in it, notwithstanding any sentence or acts of parliament to the contrary: but without any mention of the papal dispensation, the chief pretence for its validity. The Princess Elizabeth, being obliquely declared illegitimate by this law, was treated with great indifference. Other bills passed, for the attainders of the Archbishop Cranmer, the Marquis of Northamp∣ton (who was soon after pardoned, and restored to his blood and honours) the late Duke of Northumber∣land, three of his sons, and as many of his accomplices as had suffered with him; and for validating all deeds and writings made during Jane's usurpation, except∣ing her grants of crown-lands and commissions. Two bills, brought in with a view of distressing the profes∣sors of the late reformation, by subjecting such as did not say their service, nor come to church, to certain penalties to be inflicted by ecclesiastical judges, and for other punishment on such as did not attend the Roman offices of devotion, nor receive the sacra∣ment, did not pass; though both houses agreed to another, for punishing all persons, that should dis∣turb preachers, or priests ministering in other offices of religion, profane the eucharist, or pull down crosses,
<PB N="188" REF="199"/>crucifixes and images.<NOTE PLACE="inter">King Edward's laws in favour of the reforma∣tion annulled.</NOTE> But the princi∣pal act was, that for repealing all the laws and statutes, made in King Ed∣ward's time, in derogation of the doc∣trines of the church of Rome, and in favour of the reformation, which was now left on the same footing as it stood on at the time of Henry VIII.'s decease. By this act, which the pretence of a further considera∣tion of what had been done in the late King's minority served to countenance, all former statutes for the first and second liturgy, for administering the sacrament in both kinds, for confirming the new ordinal, for abro∣gating certain fasts and festivals formerly observed, for authorising the marriages of priests, and legitimating their children, and for regulating the nomination of Bishops, and the exercise of their jurisdiction, were at once annulled. Then the parliament renewed an act of the late reign against more than twelve persons as∣sembling with a design to alter the established religion, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 140 of this volume.</NOTE> and repealed the attainder of the Duke of Norfolk<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 59, 60, and 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There were some other acts which Mary had much at heart, in favour of Cardinal Pole, and the Papal claims, but it was not yet seasonable to attempt them. Cardinal Dandino, Legate at Brussels, had sent Fr. Commendone over to England, to see whether she would reconcile the realm to the church of Rome: and this trusty and able minister received from her as∣surances of her full resolution to do so, but that she must proceed with caution and secresy, for sear of rais∣ing disturbances, which might defeat her design. Pope Julius III. upon this advice, appointed Pole his Le∣gate in England; who, setting out from Rome, in August, intended to proceed through Germany to Brussels, where he proposed to make some stay, till
<PB N="189" REF="200"/>the manner of his reception in England was determined: but he had not reached Trent, when his journey was stopped by fresh orders, and he returned, in the be∣ginning of September, to the neighbourhood of Luna. Hearing afterwards of the repeal of King Edward's laws, he set forwards again; but, the people not being yet prepared to bear the sight of a Papal minister, and being extremely averse to a re-establishment of the Pope's power, which they expected would be followed by all the exactions and grievances, so continually complained of by their ancestors, he was stopped a second time at Dillinghen. Gardiner did not like his coming over, fearing he would govern all in England: and the commons, who had not passed the act for re∣pealing the late King's laws, till after several long and warm debates for eight days together, and a division of above a third part the house against it, being sounded on the subject of the Papal supremacy, appeared so averse to it, that it was not thought advisable to make the attempt.</P>
<P>The Emperor had proposed his son Philip to Mary for a husband, and she had agreed to it so readily, that the articles were drawing up in the beginning of Sep∣tember. Her confessor was gained to promote it, and Gardiner by the promise of a Cardinal's hat; Paget by money; and the Earl of Arundel by his own am∣bitious projects. He imagined, that, if she married a foreigner, he might, by that foreigner's favour, get his son (who died some time after at Brussels) to marry the Princess Elizabeth: which would be a means of putting the administration of public affairs into his hands, and bringing at last the succession of the crown into his family; it being generally thought that the Queen's infirmities incapacitated her for bearing chil∣dren. These were her chief favourites; and Norfolk agreed with them, having ever been in the Imperial interest. Most of the council were of opinion, that she could not espouse a foreigner without espousing his

<PB N="190" REF="203"/>quarrels; that a match with Spain would involve her in continual wars with France and Scotland; that the nation would never digest the government of a fo∣reigner; and therefore advised her to marry an Eng∣lishman, to the perpetual quiet of her realm, and the general satisfaction of her subjects. Sir Thomas Cheyne went so far, as to propose the Earl of Devon∣shire: but Mary, whose heart, temper, and manners, were entirely Spanish, excepted against the Earl as too young and unexperienced in business; and declared, she would never marry a subject or servant, as she could get no honour nor respect by such a marriage. This answer might stop the mouths of her counsellors, but it did not quiet the minds of her subjects. Pam∣phlets were published, representing Philip as proud, arrogant, intractable, and incompatible with any one, even with his own father, unequal to her in age, sure to treat her with contempt, and not to stay with her to get children; and as one who, having nothing more in his view than to get England for his son Don Carlos, would domineer over it in the same imperious manner the Spaniards did in all places, and as he himself prac∣tised in Naples, Milan, and his other territories, where an infinite number of ancient families were ruined, and their estates seized, by his Spanish favourites. Libels were dispersed and dropped in the city, in the court, and even in her chamber; and some great men, seeing the Queen resolved upon Philip, were for Courtenay's marrying the Princess Elizabeth, and carrying her down to Devonshire and Cornwall: the Duke of Suf∣folk, the Earls of Pembroke and Cumberland, the Lord Clinton, and other noblemen, with all the mili∣tary men, were for this party.</P>
<P>An address from the house of Commons, that the Queen would not marry a foreigner, but one of her own countrymen, gave her a great deal of perplexity. She did not care to receive it; and had at first a just excuse, being then ill of a disease, which afflicted
<PB N="191" REF="204"/>her annually, attended with a continual palpitation of heart, and affecting her so, that she did nothing but weep whilst it lasted. After her-recovery, she still af∣fected delays; and above a month passed, after the address was drawn up, before it could be presented. Her answer was, that "she held her crown of God, and hoped to find council from him alone on so impor∣tant an occasion; that she had not yet taken any reso∣lution on the subject, but, whenever she did, she would take care to consult in her marriage the good of the realm, and the benefit of her Commons, though she herself was principally concerned." The Queen had got the house sounded in relation to another measure, dictated by her passions and hatred to her sister Eliza∣beth: but met with a repulse, which the injustice of the proposal well deserved. When the Princess Eli∣zabeth had complied with her in going to mass, she affected to shew her some favours, knowing how ser∣viceable she might be in getting the parliament's con∣sent to her measures: but this was all grimace. She had before used to hold Elizabeth by the hand in all great assemblies at court, and shewed her other marks of friendship and honour: but after the repeal of the late King's lawas in favour of the reformation, took all methods of treating her with such neglect, and marks of malevolence, that no body about the court durst visit the Princess in her chamber, or speak to her, without the Queen's knowledge. Mary, in getting her own mother's divorce annulled, and removing the slur of illegitimation from herself, had taken care to leave it still upon her sister; but this not being deemed susti∣cient, she used all her interest with the parliament, to get the Princess expressly declared a bastard, and ex∣cluded from the right of succession. The members absolutely refused to come into these measures; and the Queen, not finding the parliament fit for all her purposes, dissolved it on December 6; resolving to as∣sume

<PB N="192" REF="207"/>a more absolute command in government than she had yet exercised.</P>
<P>The convocation of Canterbury still continued sitting, and was not dissolved till a week after the parliament.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings in convoca∣tion.</NOTE> In the writ of summons, Mary assumed the stile of <HI>Supreme head of the churches of England and Ireland;</HI> and, as she had used her supremacy for dispossessing the re∣formed Bishops, she now exercised it in so unconstitu∣tional a manner, as to get what proctors she pleased re∣turned for representatives of every diocese. It is otherwise inconceivable, that, when three fourths of the parochial clergy throughout England were, within a few months, turned out of their benefices, for their inclination to the reformed religion, there should not be so much as one of the same sentiments returned to represent them in this convocation. The reformed deans and dignitaries had been deprived, to make room for others popishly affected: and this practice had been so general, that there were not above two Deans and four Archdeacons in the lower house to defend the late reformation. Dr. Hugh Weston, newly substituted Dean of Westminster in the room of Dr. Cox, was chosen prolocutor: and, on October 18, signified to the house the Queen's pleasure, that they should de∣bate touching matters of religion, and proceed to the making such constitutions as they should think neces∣sary. The main point in debate related to the presence of Christ in the holy sacrament: and James Haddon and Walter Philips, deans of Exeter and Rochester, John Philpot, John Elmer, and Richard Cheney, arch∣deacons of Winchester, Stow, and Hereford, with an∣other, were all the disputants on the Protestant side of the question. They held, "that though Christ was indeed present in the sacrament, rightly ministered ac∣cording to his institution, yet he was not present in that gross and carnal manner which those of the Po∣pish party maintained." They were often checked by
<PB N="193" REF="208"/>the prolocutor; and though some great Lords attend∣ed; there was a great deal of disorder in the disputa∣tion, which hindered it from producing any good ef∣fect. Both sides pretended to the victory in this dis∣pute, which lasted six days; till Weston notified to them the Queen's pleasure for putting an end to the debate; and said to the reformed divines, <HI>You have the word, and we have the sword;</HI> expressions that shewed plainly which side had the better of the argument.</P>
<P>One side being possessed of the sword of government, that overpowering argument, made up for all deficiencies of truth or reason to support their cause.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Foreigners and others quit the realm.</NOTE> Two preliminaries were issued, upon the breaking up of the parliament, for putting in execution the act which had passed in it, for repealing all the late King's statutes about religion. Orders were given for the mass to be said, and all the Latin offices to be used, on Decem∣ber 20, in all churches of the kingdom, as at the death of Henry VIII. This was begun that day, and con∣tinued all the Queen's reign, without interruption. The severities, which, from the time of her accession to the throne, had been exercised upon the reformed, had prepared them all to expect a cruel persecution; and those, who had most distinguished themselves, sought for opportunities of crossing the seas, to take refuge in foreign countries. John a Lasco, with his German congregation, and other foreigners, had been ordered in September to quit the realm, and about 170 of them went away then in two ships for Copenhagen, leaving only two of their ministers to serve their coun∣trymen, that were merchants settled in London. Pe∣ter Martyr, though he had come over on the public faith, being invited by King Edward, and sent by the city of Strasburgh, and had, on that account, obtained the Queen's licence to return, was so eagerly sought after by his enemies, that it was not without great dif∣ficulty be made his escape into Germany. Coverdale,
<PB N="194" REF="209"/>Bishop of Exeter, obtained the liberty of transporting him∣self, by the intercession of the King of Denmark: Poynet of Winchester got beyond sea as well as he could, and was followed by Scory and Barlow of Chichester and Wells, as they found opportunities: the rest of the re∣formed Prelates were too closely imprisoned to escape.</P>
<P>A. D. 1554.] The late act, repealing Edward's laws, and restoring the mass and other Roman services,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The married clergy turned out of their livings.</NOTE> consequently deprived all the beneficed clergy, and all that mi∣nistered in the church, if they did not comply in officiating by those services. The repealing the statutes that authorised their mar∣riages, left them open to the lash of the canon law; which, though not obligatory in this country, any farther than warranted by custom, or consistent with the laws of the land, was, upon the repeal of those statutes, very clear in disabling the regular clergy, who had made vows of celibacy. How far the private marriages of the secular clergy before the reformation, in consequence of a general connivance, derogated from the custom which gave force to the parts of the canon law received in England, is a question fit only for law∣yers to decide: but it seems contrary to natural equity, that a bare repeal of former laws should, without ex∣press words warranting a retrospect, he made use of to invalidate, from the beginning, those marriages which the laws had authorised, and to punish such as had lawfully contracted them, not for their future, but their past, conduct. The Queen's instructions, on March 4, to the Bishops, ordered them to deprive all the married clergy of their ecclesiastical benefices and promotions, and not suffer them to bide with their wives, but to divorce and punish them; though such priests were to be more favourably treated, that with their wives consent promised to abstain. This favour was referred to the Bishops discretion, and consisted in admitting them to their former functions, but not
<PB N="195" REF="210"/>in the same place they were in before, and in allowing them some small part of the benefice of which they were dispossessed; for all to be deprived, and to do penance; the form of confession on that occasion being generally drawn in terms that a man could hardly affirm with veracity. The savour here mentioned was not intended for the regulars, who were dealt with more severely than the seculars, and yet very few of these last received any benefit thence, by reason of the Bishops discretionary power. Bonner, indulging himself in a promiscuous concubinage, had several bastards: and was so fond of anticipating orders, that he bad turned all the married priests, in his diocese, out of their livings, before the end of February. In March, the Queen's commissioners deprived the Archbishop of York, the Bishops of St. David's, Chester, and Bristol, who had been regulars, and those of Gloucester and Hereford, being only seculars, for their marriage. Taylor, Bishop of Lincoln, being unmarried, was, at the same time, deprived of his see, for the pretended misde∣meanor of having taken a grant of his bishopric from Edward VI. with the clause, <HI>Quamdiu bene se gesserit,</HI> i. e. whilst he behaved himself so as not to merit a de∣privation by some act, which the laws or canons punish∣ed with that penalty. Scory and Barlow, Bishops of Chichester and Bath, prevented the like sentences by a resignation, which contributed to their escape abroad. Thousands of the inferior clergy were, in a very short time, deprived of their livings or their ministrations, on account either of their marriage, or not conforming to the mass; many of them, upon common same, with∣out process, uncited, unheard, and with shocking cir∣cumstances of injustice and oppression.</P>
<P>These changes naturally raised great discontents among the reformed in all parts of the kingdom, par∣ticularly in London, where they were much more nu∣merous than their adversaries: but the effects were not so violent, as those excited by the Spanish match,
<PB N="196" REF="211"/>which occasioned a general clamour. Papists and Protestants equally detested it, dreading the inquisition, confiscation of estates, invasion of privileges, destruc∣tion of liberties, and a shoal of other calamities, the usual attendants of Spanish tyranny: but the Queen was resolved upon the match, and it was impossible to divert her from it by any remonstrances.</P>
<P>The treaty for it had lain dormant whilst the parlia∣ment was sitting: but, soon after the dissolution, the Counts of Egmond and Lalain, John de Montmorency Lord of Courieres, and two other ambassadors, were sent over by the Emperor to conclude it in form, and adjust the articles: which was done accordingly, and they were signed, on Friday, January 12, by the Im∣perial ambassadors, and by the Lord Chancellor, the Earl of Arundel, the Lord Paget, Sir Robert Roches∣ter, and Sir W. Petre, the Queen's commissioners: and, on the Sunday and Monday following, were communicated by Gardiner to the nobility at court, and to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, with a pompous account of the advantages thereof to the nation, and an high encomium of Philip. But this declaration of Gardiner's did not cure the jealou∣sies of the people; and their discontents were so plain, that the Emperor was in some pain for his son's safety, when he should arrive in England.</P>
<P>The people, more clamourous in proclaiming their grievances,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Sir T. Wyat's insurrection.</NOTE> than either cool in consider∣ing, or wise in taking proper methods for their relief, vented their fury in loud and useless exclamations against the Spaniards; and, tho' they did not want numbers for any enterprise, they had no leader capable of forming a great design, and qua∣lified to unite them in its execution. Every one took the step he imagined most conducive to his end, but without a proper concert: and, as the most obvious thing which offered itself to their thoughts, was the necessity of succours from France, to oppose the
<PB N="197" REF="212"/>mighty power of the Emperor, some applied to the French Ambassador in England for assistance. M. de Noailles gave them a cool answer, being afraid of in∣volving his master in a war with England: and when the Mayor and Aldermen of Plymouth offered, by their agent sent on purpose to the court of France, to put themselves under the Gallic Monarch's protection, and to receive a garrison of his troops, being resolved not to admit Philip, nor obey any of his commands, their proposal was not accepted for the same reason: The English, however, resolved upon an insurrection: and Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, who had been lately pardoned, seemed, on account of his superior quality, personal bravery, and experience in war, a fit person to head the undertaking. But he had no enterprizing genius, and wanted that sudden courage of mind, and vigour in action, which are the life and soul of such affairs: and, though his brother the Lord Thomas Grey, a man of more active resolution, got him to undertake for raising the midland counties, yet his Grace had otherwise a small share in advancing the design. Sir Thomas Wyat, a Kentish gentleman, much esteemed and beloved, was the most active per∣son in the affair: he had been frequently employed in embassies, particularly in Spain; and, having there observed the subtlety and cruelty of the Spaniards, he had contracted an utter aversion to their manner of go∣vernment. Sir Peter Carew, and other gentlemen, embarked with him in the design: but they resolved not to attempt any thing till Philip's landing, when, they expected, the nation would be most affected with a sense of their immediate danger.</P>
<P>This undertaking might, in all probability, have succeeded, had a general rising been made, as propo∣sed, in all parts of the country at one time: but either the government had some information of the design, as it seems not improbable from some measures they took four days before the rising, or else, as is gene∣rally
<PB N="198" REF="213"/>said, the concert was broke by Sir Peter Carew. This gentleman, too indiscreet in communicating the affair, or too eager to appear in arms, perhaps out of fear that delays might produce a discovery, and pre∣vent the execution of the design, began, before the time appointed, to raise men in Cornwall: but, not having got a competent force together, when a supe∣rior one marched against him, he was obliged to fly to France for resuge. This alarmed the other conspi∣rators, and disconcerred all their measures. The Duke of Susfolk, to avoid an ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est, left the town, on Janu∣ary 25, with the Lords Thomas and Leonard his bro∣thers; and going down to his estates in the shires of Warwick and Liecester, endeavoured to raise the coun∣try: but was followed so close by Francis Hastings Earl of Huntingdon, with a body of three hundred horse, that, not having a force sufficient to oppose him, he dismissed his small party; and, trusting to one Un∣derwood, his park keeper at Astley, for concealment, was betrayed by him, and delivered up to Hunting∣don. Sir Thomas Cheney, Warden of the Cinque ports, had been sent to take care of Kent: but was not able to prevent Sir T. Wyat's rising, on January 25, at Maidstone, where he published a declaration, against the Queen's evil counsellors, and the Spanish match, which he plainly saw would ruin the nation. The country flocking in to him, he advanced with 12 or 1500 men to Rochester, and took up his head-quar∣ters in the castle. Mary was a little puzzled how to act on this occasion; she was jealous, that the rebels designed to marry her sister to the Earl of Devon, and put them upon the throne: and yet, they were both such favourites of the nation, that it was dangerous to take them up at so ticklish a juncture, especially as it did not appear that they had the least concern in the insurrection. She knew not well whom to suspect; and it was only out of abundant caution, that the Mar∣quis of Northampton (lately pardoned) the Lord Darcy,
<PB N="199" REF="214"/>Sir Edward Warner, and others, found afterwards to be innocent, were committed to the Tower. How∣ever, she sent the Duke of Norfolk, and Sir H. Jer∣negan, with a great part of her guards, and a body of other forces, against the rebels: and to increase their numbers, the city of London raised 500 men, and sent them under one Alexander Brett, to reinforce the Queen's troops. Norfolk advancing, on Monday, January 29, to Rochester bridge, found it guarded by the rebels, and the river lined by 60 or 80 pieces of cannon; yet he resolved to force his passage, if they did not submit upon the offer of a pardon. It was not accepted by any one, except, in appearance, by Sir George Harper; who, going over to the Duke, per∣suaded the 500 Londoners to desert, and they, ad∣vancing to the bridge, turned suddenly about, and declared for Wyat: which put Norfolk and Jernegan in such confusion, that they immediately sled; and Wyat, coming up with a party of horse, intercepted the rest, and seized eight brass cannon, with the Duke's baggage. Had this bold chieftain marched directly to London, as was proposed, without losing time, he would have found an easy admittance into the city, and the Queen would have been in the utmost distress.</P>
<P>But his delays allowing her time to recollect herself, and provide better for her security, to encourage her friends, and intimidate the disaffected, she caused, on February 1, proclamation to be made over the city, that the Duke of Suffolk and Sir Peter Carew, with their accomplices, were dispersed and fled; offering, at the same time, a general pardon to all the Kentish-men, except Wyat, Harper, Sir Henry Isley, and Rudstone, and a reward of 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year in land, for ever, to any person who should take the first of those rebels. Count Egmond fell down the river to fetch over 4 or 5000 Spaniards from Flanders: and the Queen went in the afternoon, with her ladies and train, making a mourn∣ful figure, to Guildhall, where the common council
<PB N="200" REF="215"/>was assembled. She there made a vehement speech against Wyat, "representing the insolence of his de∣mands, that she should put her own person and four of her council into his hands; and (to render him odious) charging him with a design to sack the city." To engage the Londoners the more firmly to her in∣terest, she declared her resolution of taking up her re∣sidence within their walls; but in the mean time armed a body of 500 men, chiefly foreigners, for the defence of the bridge. Her speech had such an effect, by the assistance of her agents, that the city re∣solved to defend itielf, and 20,000 men took arms, the next day, in her behalf. W. Lord Howard of Effingham was appointed to command them, as her lieutenant in London; and it was proposed, that the Earl of Pembroke should march with 6 or 7000 of them against Wyat; but the Londoners absolutely re∣fused to cross the river. The weather was very bad, provisions exceeding scarce, and, Wyat having no money to supply the wants of his men, they deserted in great numbers, during his stay at Deptford: but marching thence, on February 3, he entered South∣wark without opposition, and found there some relief: but the draw-bridge was taken away, and the gate so well guarded, that there was no forcing a passage that way into London. Provisions began to be scarce on the other side of the river: and the Queen could not forbear expressing her astonishment, that she and her council should be besieged by such a handful of men (for the rebels were not above 2000, when they en∣tered Southwark) in so populous a town, in the midst of ber realm, with all her nobility about her, and no body daring to undertake the suppressing them; which gave reason to think that few disapproved Wyat's proceed∣ings. Affairs seemed in so bad a state, that all the council declared, they never liked the match: and the Queen condescended to send Wyat a message, pressing him to lay down his arms, and promising that she
<PB N="201" REF="216"/>would not marry the Prince of Spain; that she would pardon him with all his companions, and never bear him the least ill will:" but he demanded the Tower, with four of her council, and insisted on seeing her actually married to an Englishman.</P>
<P>Having settled matters with his friends in the city, Wyat marched with 1500 men, on February 6, from Southwark to Kingston; where he found the bridge broke down, and 2 or 300 men posted on the other side the river. Two pieces of cannon made them re∣tire; and having repaired the bridge, he passed all his forces over in two hours, and advanced, about eleven at night, without resting, directly towards London. He might have reached London in the dead of the night; and he marched, undiscovered by any of the Queen's scouts, to Brentford: but, when he had passed this place, the wheels of one of his car∣riages broke, and he would stay to have the cannon re∣mounted. Several experienced officers were against a delay, which would break their appointments with the citizens: but he was deaf to all their remonstran∣ces, which gave every body so ill an opinion of the enterprise, that abundance of his men quitted him; and Harper, to procure his pardon, made haste to court, and gave the Queen an account of Wyat's pro∣ceeding and designs. Effingham was immediately or∣dered to his charge in the city; and Pembroke drew out his forces, amounting to 7 or 8000 men, which had been raised during Wyat's stay at Deptford and Southwark. Wyat, after making a halt at Knightsbridge to refresh his men, advanced about noon through Pica∣dilly to St. James's, passing by the Earl of Pembroke's Gens d' armes, which were posted on an hill against it, without any attack, except of his rear, which he would not march back to support. Followed by that Earl, and continuing his march to Charing-cross, he char∣ged Sir John Gage the Lord Chamberlain, who was posted there with a body of horse, and a thousand
<PB N="202" REF="217"/>foot, so bristly, that he put them to flight, and seized their train of arrillery: a disaster which threw the court at Whitehall into the utmost terror and confu∣sion. Wyat still advanced with his party, passing through the midst of armed men, that lined the streets, without any opposition, till he came to Ludgate, which he expected would be opened to him: but Lord Ef∣fingham being there, with a strong guard, prevented his entrance. This disappointment frighted his men so, that only eighty were lest with him; and with these retiring to Temple-Bar, he there faced all the Queen's army under the Earl of Pembroke, and stood his ground, till a composition was made by her Majesty's sending a general pardon for all his party. He then yielded to Sir Maurice Berkeley, and after being ex∣amined by the council, was carried to the Tower.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">The Princess Eliza∣beth and Earl of Devon taken into custody.</NOTE> The rebellion was no sooner sup∣pressed, than the Earl of Devonshire was taken up; put into the custody of the Earl of Sussex; and after a few days sent to the Tower. A party likewise of 500 horse was sent to Asheridge in Buck∣inghamshire, to bring up the Princess Elizabeth: but she had been ill for some time, and several days passed before she was able to bear travelling. Her distemper was generally supposed to be a dropsy: but, whatever it was, she began to recover in the beginning of March; and desiring to speak with the Queen, was refused an audience. This was done on pretence that she ought first to clear herself of the suspicions under which she lay: but the true reason was, the Queen had resolved on her death, all means being used to find out matter of accusation against her, in order to a charge then actually drawing up in form, she was committed prisoner to the Tower. But these measures failing, she was released on May 19, and passing by West∣minster without seeing the Queen, went to Richmond in Surry: and declining a match proposed by the Im∣perial
<PB N="203" REF="218"/>ministers, with Philbert Emanuel Duke of Savoy, was sent thence to Woodstock in Oxfordshire, where she was kept under the care of the Lord Williams of Tame and Sir H. Bedingfield. The Earl of Devon∣shire was soon afterwards conveyed prisoner to the castle of Fothcringhay in Northamptonshire. Being set at liberty on April 5, 1555, at the intercession of King Philip, he went to Brussels; but sinding himself watched there by spice, he got leave to travel into Italy, where he died, at Fadua, on October 4, next year.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Lady Jane Grey and her husband, with others, put to death.</NOTE> The share, which the Duke of Suf∣folk had in Wyat's insurrection, proved satal to his daughter the Lady Jane, who acquainted him in a letter, that she was not insensible that he had shortened her days. Before this rebellion, Mary seemed disposed to deal gently with Jane: for after she was found guilty of high trerson, she had the liberty of the <HI>pa∣rade</HI> in the Tower, and of walking in the Queen's garden; but now it was thought necessary to proceed to extremities, Mary's sasety being deemed precarious while her rival was alive. Dr. Fecknam Dean of St. Paul's was sent with a message from the Queen, de∣siring that she and her husband might prepare for im∣mediate death, and exhorted her to embrace the Ro∣man Catholic religion. She received the message with great temper and evenness of mind; but as to the Doctor's advice, she said she had no time to enter into religious controversies, and should spend the little time she had in preparing for eternity. Fecknam, mistaking her meaning, prevailed upon Mary to grant her a re∣prieve for three days. When he acquainted the un∣happy captive of the respite, he desired she would hear him on the subject of religion. Jane told him, he had mistaken her meaning, and that she was not desirous of longer life. Then he disputed with her upon different points of religion, concerning which she argued with uncommon strength of reason, display∣ing
<PB N="204" REF="219"/>a surprising fund of knowledge. Her husband, the Lord Guilford Dudley, desired to take his last farewel of her before he suffered; and this request was granted: but she would not consent to such an interview, lest it should, by an unreasonable tender∣ness, shake their mutual fortitude, and make them leave the world with greater regret, neither of them being seventeen years of age. However, on February 12, the day of their execution, she viewed him through the window as he went to Tower-hill, and even saw his headless corpse brought back in a cart to be in∣terred in the Tower chapel. As her usurpation had been involuntary on her part, and her case generally pitied, it was not judged proper to execute her in pub∣lic; therefore the Tower was determined on for the fatal scene. About two hours after her busband's death she was conducted to the scaffold, and in her way thither saluted the spectators with equal affability and composure, holding Dr. Fecknam by the hand. The Lieutenant of the Tower begging she would favour him with some memorial, she presented him with tablets, in which she had written three short sentences in the Greek and Latin languages, setting forth her own case. When she reached the place of her suffer∣ing, she embraced Fecknam most affectionately, say∣ing, "God will requite you, good Sir, for your hu∣manity to me; though it gave me more uneasiness than all the terrors of approaching death." In her speech on the scaffold, she owned herself guilty, not that she had grasped at the crown, but because she had not refused the offer. She desired that her mis∣fortune might be a warning to posterity, that innocent meaning is not a sufficient excuse for disturbing the pub∣lic: and observed, that those who yield to other people's ambition, help to accomplish their schemes, and are drawn into unlawful practices, though against their will, have a great deal to answer for. Having spent a short time in devotion, her female attendants took
<PB N="205" REF="220"/>off her grown, and the ornaments of her head and neck, and covered her eyes with a handkerchief. Then she laid her head on the block, and encouraged the execu∣tioner, who at first hesitated to execute his office; which at length, however, he performed; her fate drawing tears from the eyes of all the spectators, Papists as well as Protestants. Her father, the Duke of Suf∣folk, was, five days after, tried before the Earl of Arun∣del; and pleaded in his defence, that it was no treason in a peer of the realm, to raise his power, and make proclamation, only to keep strangers out of the realm; desiring the opinion of the serjeants at law then present. They declining to give it, he was, on February 23, beheaded, his brother Lord Thomas undergoing the same fate on April 27.</P>
<P>Mary made a pretence of Wyat's rebellion, to take up every one she suspected, and she suspected all that had either experience or talents for war, or any considerable interest in their countries. The Tower of London was soon filled with persons of the first distinction: above fifty officers, knights, and gentlemen, besides Wyat, were put to death, as soon as the rebellion was suppressed. This might be the effect of Spanish politics; but what she did to the common people, probably, arose from a cruel and vindictive temper. All Princes used to spare, or make few examples of these, yet she not only sent twenty-two to be executed with Alexander Brett in Kent, but causing twenty gibbets to be erected in different quarters of London, hanged fifty of the insurgents on them, so that no body could walk the streets without an offensive and shocking spectacle. About 400 were led in procession with halters about their necks, to the Tilt-yard; where, from a gallery in Whitehall, she granted them a pardon; but, notwith∣standing this shew of clemency, there were above 400 of these common men executed before March 12: how many suffered afterwards doth not appear by suf∣ficient evidence.</P>
<PB N="206" REF="221"/>
<P>The parliament met on Thursday, April 5; and the Chancellor, in his speech to the two houses, after "asserting the Queen's right to the crown by inheri∣tance and the regular course of the succession, and affirming her right to chuse a husband for herself, maintained, that she had exercised this last very pro∣perly, and laid before them the articles of marriage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These articles implied—That, by virtue of the marriage, Philip should enjoy the title of King of England, conjunctly with Mary, as long as the marriage should subsist; but that the Queen should dispose of the revenues of England, and the nomination to all em∣ployments and benefices should be conferred upon the natives of England only: that she should enjoy the titles belonging to the King her husband: that her jointure should be sixty thousand livres: that the children of the marriage should succeed to the effects of the mo∣ther: that the Archduke Charles, the son of Philip, should enjoy the kingdom of Spain, Naples and Sicily, with the duchy of Milan, and all the Italian dominions; but, in default of Prince Charles and his issue, those sovereignties should devolve to the eldest born of Philip and Mary: that this first born should, at any rate, have Bur∣gundy and the Netherlands: that the younger sons and daughters of the marriage should be provided with appanages, and portions in England: that in case the marriage should produce daughters only, the eldest should succeed to Burgundy and the Netherlands, provided she should, with the consent of her brother Charles, espouse a native of these countries, or one of her mother's dominions; otherwise Prince Charles should keep possession of these countries, and provide her with a portion assigned upon Spain and the Netherlands: that, if Prince Charles should die without issue, the eldest son of Philip and Mary, or in default of sons, the eldest daughter should succeed to all the dominions of her father and mother; and that the successor should not intrench upon the laws, customs, and privileges, of the countries composing his or her inheritance, nor administer the government by any other than natives of the respective countries.—There was a clause annexed, importing, that, before the consummation of the marriage, Philip should solemnly swear to the observation of the fol∣lowing articles: That all his domestics should be English, or subjects of the Queen: that he should bring no foreigner into England, who might be disagreeable to the natives of this country: that he should make no change in the laws, statutes, and customs, of England: that he should not convey the Queen from her dominions, without her own express desire; nor any of the children, without the consent of the no∣bility: that, in case of his surviving the Queen without issue by her he should not arrogate any right to himself upon England or its de∣pendencies; but leave the succession to the lawful heir: that he should not carry jewels or any thing of value out of the kingdom; nor alie∣nate any thing belonging to the crown, nor suffer any sort of usur∣pation: and that, notwithstanding this marriage, the alliance be∣tween England and France should remain uninfringed.</NOTE>."
<PB N="207" REF="222"/>But the main tendency of his speech was, to endea∣vour the getting such a power vested in the Queen, as should enable her to settle the succession, according to her own pleasure. This proposal was supposed to come from the Emperor; who wanted to have matters so settled before his son's arrival, that the Queen might dispose of the crown, in such manner, as he did not doubt to prevail on her to do. However, the two houses were so alarmed at this scheme for disinheriting the Princess Elizabeth, and subjecting the nation to a fo∣reign yoke, and to Spanish tyranny, that they not only rejected it, but took some precautions against any pre∣tence for such an attempt. Thus they would not allow Philip, even, a matrimonial crown; and, tho' they confirmed the articles of the marriage, they added a proviso, declaring, "that her Majesty, as their <HI>only Queen, should solely, and as a sole Queen,</HI> enjoy the crown and sovereignty of her realms and subjects, with all the pre-eminencies, dignities, and rights, thereto be∣longing, in such <HI>sole and only estate,</HI> and in as large and ample a manner in all degrees and exercises, from and after the solemnization of the said marriage, and at all times during the same, as she used to do before, and actually enjoyed at present, without any right, title, claim, or demand, to be given, come, or accrue to the Prince of Spain, either as tenant by courtesy of the realms, or by <HI>any other means,</HI> in virtue of the said marriage, of, in, and to the said crown, sovereignty, realms, dominions, authority, and rights thereunto belonging, notwithstanding the said marriage, or any statute, prescription, custom, or <HI>any other thing</HI> to the contrary." Affirming her right to the ordinary au∣thority of a King, they avoided investing her with the extraordinary powers granted to Henry VIII. and when
<PB N="208" REF="223"/>a bill was afterwards, on April 17, brought into the house of Lords, for declaring <HI>or imagining the death of the Queen's husband, whilst he was alive, to be treason,</HI> they were so jealous of its being abused to an ill pur∣pose, that it was laid aside after the first reading. There was certainly ground enough for this jealousy, when Philip's partizans gave out in all places, that he was <HI>the true and undoubted heir, by right of inheritance,</HI> to this crown, as descended of John of Gaunt, and shew∣ed every where a tree of consanguinity, which they had drawn up so, as to contain only the persons that served to deduce his descent; omitting entirely the elder branches. It caused a general indignation to see the Queen encouraging such impostures: and the people exclaimed furiously against her, for making no con∣science, either of taking away the crown from the right heirs, or of giving it to a foreigner.</P>
<P>The parliament rejected some other bills relating to religion; particularly two for taking away the pensi∣ons from married priests, one for suppressing erroneous opinions contained in books, and two others for re∣viving the act of the six articles, and the old statutes against the Lollards, heresy, and erroneous preaching. Cardinal Pole had arrived, on January 25, at Brussels: and, matters not being yet sufficiently prepared for his reception in England, he employed himself in medi∣ating a peace between France and the Emperor. How∣ever, he did not neglect pressing the Queen, by letters and messages, to unite the realm to the see of Rome, and to restore the Papal supremacy, without deferring it a moment for any worldly considerations: but she had her marriage so much at heart, that, till it was set∣tled, she would not trouble herself about religion. He was surprised to find her insisting, that the Pope should confirm the possessors in the enjoyment of church-lands for ever; and he in vain attempted to dissuade her from it; demanding, at the same time, to be restored
<PB N="209" REF="224"/>to his own estate; which it was not yet seasonable to attempt.</P>
<P>Six new Bishops had been consecrated, the day be∣fore the meeting of the parliament, to increase the number of votes in the house of Lords: yet there did not appear above ten of this order on the first day of the session. One of these was Tonstal, stiled Bishop of Durham; though that bishopric was actually dis∣solved, and continued so till the end of this session, when an act passed for its re-erection, and restoring him to all its former possessions, except Cold-Harbour, and some other houses in London, which had been granted to the Earl of Shrewsbury. The Queen dissolved the parliament on May 5, and then issued a proclamation, fixing the rate of the currency of Spanish and Portu∣guese crusadoes, in which, probably, numbers of the members had been paid.</P>
<P>Nothing now took up Mary's thoughts but the ex∣pectations of Philip's arrival, and the making of pre∣parations for his reception. She had never seen him, but his picture had charmed her: she thought every day an age till he came, and was impatient at his af∣fected delays. He arrived, on July 19,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Philip ar∣rives, and is married to the Queen.</NOTE> off the isle of Wight, with a fleet of 160 sail, on board of which were 6000 Spaniards, designed to serve in England had there been occasion: but the malecontents, in despair of succours, after being bid to expect nothing from France, had laid aside all thoughts of an insurrection. He brought with him a vast treasure, two cart-loads of coin, and ninety-seven chests of bullion: and the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord Treasurer, the Earls of Arundel and Rutland, with the Lord Paget, waiting upon him the next morning, conducted him ashore to Southampton; from whence, after a stay of three days, he removed to Winchester. The Queen met him at this last place, and they were married on Wednesday, July 25, the feast of St. James, the tutelar Saint of Spain, she be∣ing
<PB N="210" REF="225"/>in her 39th year, and older than him by eleven years and three months; the Marquis of Winchester, with the Earls of Arundel, Bedford, Derby, and Pem∣broke, performing the ceremony of giving her away, in the name of the kingdom; and Gardiner celebrating the marriage-office. On August 18, they made a pompous entry into London: where pageants and triumphal arches had been erected, and other marks of rejoicing were exhibited at a vast expence. Removing in a few days from Whitehall to Richmond, they dis∣missed their train of nobility; and then retiring to Hampton-Court, made it their ordinary residence. Mary had there her husband to herself, scarce ever suffering him to be a moment out of her sight. He was stiff, reserved, and formal; no drawing-room was kept, and no admittance to him, but with a deal of ceremony, and after asking an audience; forms unu∣sual in England, and which did not a little disgust the nobility.</P>
<P>A parliament that would come into all the measures, was what the ministry now had principally in view. The flight of almost half the gentry of the nation, and the dispiritedness of the rest, were favourable to their wishes: and to secure it still more, the Queen issued a proclamation, directing what persons she would have chosen for the house of Commons. She thought fit likewise to insinuate continually, that she was with child, and owned her pregnancy to foreign ambassadors: but it proved only the beginning of a dropsy, though the physicians said,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Queen brings forth a mola.</NOTE> it was a mole or lump of flesh, which by its weight had a slow motion, that agitated her whole belly, and was at last taken from her, though not without great difficulty. Few people believed it, or thought it possible for her to be with child; but it was a con∣venient notion for carrying some matters in parliament, and it served to keep Philip longer in England than he would have staid. The session began on Monday, No∣vember
<PB N="211" REF="226"/>12, the Chancellor in his harangue recommend∣ed to them the King's coronation, and the settlement of religion:<NOTE PLACE="inter">The parliament admits the Pope's Legate, and the laity's possession of church lands is confirmed.</NOTE> and a bill being brought in for the repeal of Car∣dinal Pole's attainder, it was so readily passed by both houses, that it had the royal assent on the 22d; the King and Queen going both to the parliament-house, and the latter fancying that she felt the child leap in her womb upon this occasion. She carried on this farce so far, that she received compliments on it from foreign Princes, <HI>Te Deum</HI> was sung, and orders were given for prayers to be said at all masses for the child's preservation. Pole, who had waited some time near Dover, till his attainder was repealed, came on Saturday, November 24, to London; and was visited by all the nobility. On Wednesday following, the two houses were called to Whitehall: and the Cardinal, having returned his thanks for their late favour to him, exhorted them to be reconciled to the church of Rome; into the bosom whereof he was ready to receive them, and grant them an absolution from all spiritual censures. This pro∣duced a conference, next day, between committees of the Lords and Commons; and, an address being drawn up in the name of both houses, expressing a desire of their reunion, and presented to the King and Queen, the Legate, at their intercession, absolved the Parlia∣ment, the whole realm, and all the dominions of Eng∣land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Cardinal used the following form of absolution:—"Our Lord Jesus Christ, which, with his most precious blood, hath redeem∣ed and washed us from all our sins and iniquities, that he might purchase to himself a glorious spouse, without spot or wrinkle; and whom the Father hath appointed head over all his church, He by his mercy absolve you. And we, by apostolic authority given unto us (by the most Holy Lord Pope Julius III. his Vicegerent here on earth) do absolve and deliver y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and every of you, with the whole realm, and the dominions thereof, from all heresy and schism, and from all and every judgment, censures, and pains, for that cause in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urred. And also we do restore you again unto the unity of our mo∣ther, the holy church, as in our letters more plainly it shall appear, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." After this ceremony was over, they went in solemn procession to the chapel royal, where <HI>Te Deum</HI> was sung: and because this return to the Ro∣man communion sell on St. Andrew's day, the Cardinal procured an order for keeping that festival with an additional office. On Sunday following, the submission of the two houses to the Papal authority, and the absolution given by the Cardinal, were repeated by Bishop Gardiner, the Chancellor, in a sermon, at St. Paul's cross, from Romans xiii. 11.</NOTE>. In consequence hereof, an act was to be made
<PB N="212" REF="227"/>for repealing all the statutes formerly made against the Papal supremacy: but that affair was attended with such difficulties, that, after a week's consideration, and debates, no way could be found out, but to get the Pope to confirm all the church-lands to the present possessors. This was done upon an address from the convocation, releasing all their claim, and that of the clergy they represented, to any of them, and desiring such a confirmation: and the Legate, on December 24, signed an instrument for that purpose; which is recited in the act <HI>for repealing all statutes against the Pope, and for establishing ecclesiastical possessions conveyed to the laity.</HI> By this act, which did not pass the houses till January 4, the Papal supremacy, the jurisdiction of Bishops and ecclesiastical courts, and the prerogative of the crown, were put on the same footing, as they stood on in the 20th of Henry VIII. all sees, colleges, hospitals, schools, and other foundations erected, all legal marriages, though within the degrees prohibited by the canon law, contracted, all institutions to bene∣fices granted, and all processes carried on, and all church-lands conveyed to laymen, according to the late laws in being, since the separation from Rome, were confirmed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Laws against the Lollards revived.</NOTE> An act passed for reviving the sangui∣nary statutes against the Lollards: but some bills, for incapacitating married priests to be schoolmasters, and for vaca∣ting
<PB N="213" REF="228"/>leases, made either by them or by other spiritual persons after resignation, were laid aside. A bookseller of London, who had printed a great number of libels against the marriage, and the Romish religion, had been discovered and taken sometime in October: and it was probably owing to his confession, that, before the 26th of that month, no less than 150 persons were seized upon that account. One Rose, in a private congregation at London, had prayed, "That God would turn the Queen's heart from idolatry to the true faith, or else to shorten her days, or take her quickly out of the way;" this served for a colour to an act declaring such malicious prayers to be treason. The imagining or compassing to deprive Philip of the stile of <HI>King of England</HI> was made the like offence, and the publishing in words, that he ought not to enjoy the title, subjected the person to perpetual imprison∣ment.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the session, the Queen thought herself sure of getting Philip recognized as presumptive heir of the crown, or at least to get the administration put into his hands, that he might dispose of the trea∣sure and forces of the nation at his will: but she found herself disappointed; not being able so much as to pro∣cure for him the crown of Queen consort. The King fully expected to be crowned, and with this view made great court to the house of Commons; but they un∣animously rejected the proposal. Philip and Mary were both so incensed, that they went, with a small train, on January 16, to dissolve the parliament, without any ceremony; shewing all the world how much they were discontented at it, notwithstanding its compliance with all their desires in point of religion: but that seems but to have been a secondary view with either of them.</P>
<P>Soon after the dissolution of the parliament, several gentlemen were released from the Tower, at Philip's intercession, who had been confined, either for Wyat's
<PB N="214" REF="229"/>insurrection, or some other reason<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principal of these were Holgate, Archbishop of York, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton (who had been tried and acquitted on account of Wyat's rebellion, but nevertheless kept in prison), Sir Gawen Carew, the Lord Henry Dudley, Sir G. Harper, Sir Edmund Warner, Sir James Crofts, Sir Nicholas Arnold, and Sir William St. Low.</NOTE>. He is said like∣wise to have interceded for the Princèss Elizabeth, that her guard might be taken off, and she brought to court: but Gardiner, her mortal enemy, opposed it at first, as not proper whilst the parliament was sitting, and found means to defer it a good while longer. Philip was willing to oblige her, in hopes of making her serviceable to his purpose, if his Queen should die: and she owed her life to his fear of Mary Stuart's suc∣ceeding, in that case, to the crown of England.</P>
<P>After the laws against the Lollards were revived, they were soon put in execution.<NOTE PLACE="inter">Burnings for reli∣gion.</NOTE> The alli∣ance between the Pope and England (says M. de Noailles) was confirmed, on February 4, by the burning of Dr. John Rogers, Preben∣dary of St. Paul's (who had saved Bourne, now Bishop of Bath and Wells) in Smithfield: he went with such calmness and resolution to the stake, that he was admired and applauded by the greatest part of the spectators, who, glorying in his constancy, shouted for joy on the occasion, as if he had been going to a wed∣ding. Five days after (February 9) Dr. Rowland Taylor was burnt at Hadley, in Suffolk, where he had been Vicar, and had ventured to oppose some Romish priests, who celebrated mass in his church. Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, who acted as Chan∣cellor, Prime Minister, and chief counsellor to the Queen, being informed of his behaviour, sent for him to London, where he reviled him with the epi∣thers of traitor, villain, heretic, and knave, and com∣mitted him to the King's Bench prison, from which he
<PB N="215" REF="230"/>was, in a few days, brought to his trial, when he was condemned to be burned in his own parish. When he was conducted to the stake, and began to harangue the by-standers, one of the guards struck him on the head. Then he was fixed in a barrel of pitch, and one of the spectators throwing a stick at the old man, which wóunded him so severely that his visage was covered with blood, he replied, "Oh friend, I have harm enough, what needed that?" When he repeated a psalm in English, one of the guards struck him on the mouth, bidding him speak Latin; and while he was employed in ejaculation, another clove his head with an halbert in such a manner, that his brains came out, and he expired. John Cordmaker, Chancellor of the church of Wells, and John Bradford (another of Bourne's preservers) suffered afterwards in the same manner at London, and Laurence Saunders, who was parson of Allhallows in Bread-street, London, and descended of a gentleman's family, was burned at Coventry. John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester, was burned at the capital of his diocese, on February 9. During his im∣prisonment, Ridley, the deposed Bishop of London, wrote him a letter to encourage his constancy, and to assure him, that, notwithstanding their former diversity of opinion in certain matters, he had now a cordial affection for him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following is the substance of that epistle: "My dear bro∣ther, forasmuch as I understand by your book, that we thoroughly agree, and wholly consent together, in the substantial points of our religion, against which the world now so furiously rageth, however in times past, in certain circumstances of religion, your wisdom and my simplicity (I must confess) have a little jarred, each of us follow∣ing the abundance of his own spirit. Now (I say) be assured, that even with my whole heart (God is my witness) in the bowels of Christ, I love you in the truth, and for the truch's sake, which a∣bideth in us, as I am persuaded by the grace of God shall abide in us for evermore. And because the world, as I perceive, brother, ceaseth not to play his pageant, and busily conspireth against Christ our Saviour, with all possible force and power, exalting high things against the knowledge of God, let us join hands together in Christ, though we cannot overthrow, yet to our power, and as much as in us lieth, let us shake those high altitudes, not with carnal, but with spiritual weapons: and withal (brother) let us prepare ourselves to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay of our dissolution, by that which after the short time of this bo∣dily affliction, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we shall triumph together with him in eternal glory." See page 130 of this volume.</NOTE>. Robert Farrar, Bishop
<PB N="216" REF="231"/>of St. David's, was tried at Caermarthen by Henry Morgan, who had been promoted to his see, and con∣demned him as an heretic, for marrying after being a professed religious, for maintaining justification by faith only, and for denying transubstantiation, and the pro∣pitiatory sacrifice of the mass. He was first brought before Gardiner, and it is thought that if he had then managed with dexterity, and been smooth in his an∣swers, he might have disengaged himself, and secured his conscience and life. When before Morgan, he ap∣pealed to Cardinal Pole, who was averse to religious butchery; but Morgan would not allow his appeal. He suffered with great constancy at Caermarthen, on March 30, and put the truth of his doctrine on a very bold test: for he told a gentleman of his acquaintance, that if he perceived him uneasy under the pain, or so much as once stir in the fire, he should not believe any of his tenets. He acted as courageously as he spoke; and though his hands were burned off, he never so much as moved, till a by-stander knocked him down. Gar∣diner observing that the execution of these ecclesiastics served only to increase the zeal of the Protestants, and excite murmurings among the people, transferred to Bonner, Bishop of London, the commission he had received from the Queen for extirpating heresy, and from which he could expect nothing but the public hatred. In so doing he let loose the most savage minister of vengeance upon the reformed; for the zeal of Gar∣diner was cruel, but that of Bonner was furious.</P>
<P>In the morning of April 30, all the bells in London
<PB N="217" REF="232"/>rang for joy of the Queen's delivery. <HI>Te Deum</HI> was sung at St. Paul's, bonfires,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Report of the Queen's delivery.</NOTE> pub∣lic feastings, and other expressions of joy, were made in all parts of the city: and one preacher, the curate of St. Anne's near Aldersgate, went so far, as to give a particular account of the pro∣portion and features of the young Prince, representing him as the strongest, the finest, and most amiable child in nature. But all this joy was soon damped by the more certain advice that the Queen's big belly was only the effects of a mole. She indeed was so much out of order, and eat so very little, that the physicians said, her child could have no sustenance, nor be brought into the world alive. They flattered her with hopes of being brought to bed on June 25, and, when that day came, they persuaded her, that she had miscount∣ed two months; which she was the readier to believe, because her husband had promised to stay with her till she was delivered. The Emperor was dangerously ill, laid up of the gout all over his body. He wanted to settle his affairs, and, sending for his son, furnished him with so just a reason for a journey to Flanders, that it could not be opposed. Philip was quite tired of his wife, who kept him so continually with her, that, from the time of their marriage, they had never been asunder, day nor night, except at meals: she was grown very lean, pale, wan, and splenetic; inconso∣lable at the thoughts of losing her husband, she wept continually: but all hopes of her child-bearing being over at the latter end of August,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Philip goes to Flanders.</NOTE> he resol∣ved to set out for Flanders; and accord∣ingly leaving Whitehall on August 26, he passed through London in his way to Greenwich, the Legate on his left hand, and the Queen behind in an open litter. This parade was designed to convince the world that the Queen was in no danger; it being no easy matter to make the people believe truth, after be∣ing long imposed on by artifices. Philip, on the 29th
<PB N="218" REF="233"/>of the month, took leave of Queen, promising a speedy return in about a fortnight, and desiring Pole not to stir from her during his absence. He staid at Canterbury five or six days, much to her dissatisfaction, waiting till his equipage was ready to sail for Flanders: but, parting on Wednesday, September 4, from Dover, in the morning, he lay that night at Calais. In his letter from thence, he recommended the Princess Eli∣zabeth, as well to the Queen's good graces, as to the care of the Spaniards he had left behind; being afraid she should be put to death, and having now entertain∣ed thoughts of marrying her on his wife's decease, whose big belly turned to a dropsy.</P>
<P>The cruel persecution still raged in Eng∣land;<NOTE PLACE="inter">Persecution of the re∣formed,</NOTE> and was indeed continued to the end of this reign, more or less bloody, at dif∣ferent times, according to the circumstances of affairs, and at different places, according to the tem∣per of the Bishops, who were charged with the execu∣tion of the statutes against heresy in their respective dioceses. In all those of the province of York, there suffered only one person, who was burnt at Chester, and not more in the dioceses of Exeter, Wells, Peter∣borough, and Lincoln; very few in those of Wales, two in Ely, three in Bristol, as many in Salisbury, and none at all in those of Oxford, Gloucester, Worcester, and Hereford. The chief persecutors were Christopher∣son, Baine, and Griffi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, Bishops of Chichester, Lich∣field, and Rochester, Thorndon Suffragan of Dover, Harpsfield Archdeacon of Canterbury, and above all Bonner Bishop of London, who, without distinction of sex or age, burnt, within three years, no less than 200 persons. The inhuman barbarity of Jacques Amy, Dean of Guernsey, is so unparalleled in all the heathen persecutions of the Christians, that it ought not to be passed by in silence. Observing that Catherine Gouches, a poor widow, and her two daughters, absented themselves from church, he summoned them before
<PB N="219" REF="234"/>him: and finding that they had, in the late reign, been taught some of the reformed opinions, pro∣nounced them heretics, and condemned them to the fire, though they offered to comply with the Queen's religion. One of the daughters being with child, in the midst of the flames and anguish of the tor∣ments, her belly brake asunder, and a goodly boy dropt into the fire, but was immediately snatched up by W. House, one of the by-standers. On the news of this strange accident, one Gosling, bailiff of the island, and executor of the Dean's sentence, ordered the babe to be cast again into the flames, that there might remain no issue of an heretical parent. The whole number of those that suffered at the stake in this reign, is computed at 284; besides such as were thought to be made away with in prison, and some hundreds killed by starving, stinks, and various kinds of tortures and hardships: to say nothing of 800 exiles. These cruelties had not the effect proposed; they made men serious in religion, and to suspect the worst of Popery, as it was supported with such barbarities; and the universal constancy which appeared in the martyrs, gave many of their adversa∣ries a good opinion of the doctrines, which they attest∣ed with their blood, and brought them over to the re∣formation. Philip, afraid that the odium of all these cruelties would fall upon him, had made his confessor Alphonso, a Spanish Franciscan friar, in a sermon be∣fore him, inveigh bitterly against such savage and un∣profitable cruelties, which, far from making converts, would only create an abhorrence of their religion. It is very probable, that he did not encourage them, be∣cause they interfered with his political views, by in∣creasing the aversion which the nation had to his go∣vernment: and, either for this reason, or from his own experience in Germany, the Emperor had ad∣vised the Queen, at her first coming to the crown, to give no man any trouble on account of religion; but
<PB N="220" REF="235"/>take warning by his example, who, by endeavouring to compel others to his own religion, had spent his power in vain, and purchased nothing by it but dis∣honour.</P>
<P>Cardinal Pole was much of the same sentiments, and was for making use of the lately re∣vived statutes, purely by way of terror,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Bishops Rid∣ley and Lati∣mer burnt.</NOTE> without putting them in execution; but Gardiner, though he did not disapprove this method, with regard to the common people, was of a different opinion with regard to the reformed Bishops, dignitaries, and celebrated preachers, and even the Princess Elizabeth, and the lay nobility. These he was entirely for taking off, as the chief supporters of the ordinary people: this he called <HI>laying the axe to the root of the tree;</HI> and had the satisfaction, before his death, of seeing his advice followed in the execu∣tion of two Bishops, Ridley and Latimer. They had been removed, with Archbishop Cranmer, the last year, in April, from the Tower to Oxford; where they were to dispute with six divines, deputed by the lower house of convocation, and as many learned doctors, culled out of each of the universities, on the following questions:
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. Whether the natural body and blood of Christ, conceived of the Virgin Mary, be really in the sacrament after the words spoken by the priest?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether in the sacrament, after the words of consecration, any other substance do remain, than the substance of the body and blood of Christ?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Whether the mass be a sacrifice propitiatory, for the sins of the quick and dead?"</ITEM>
</LIST> They had but two days allowed them to prepare for the disputation, were de∣barred all access to one another, not suffered to have the use of their own books and papers; and kept in such uncomfortable places, as differed little from com∣mon dungeons. Each of them was appointed a par∣ticular day, that they might not assist one another, if there had been occasion: Cranmer's was April 16;
<PB N="221" REF="236"/>Ridley's 17, and Latimer's the day following. They were not allowed to oppose, but confined only to the part of the respondents; in which they met with con∣tinual interruptions, and such tumultuous clamours, revilings, shouts, and outcries, as were never known in any learned assembly. They all acquitted them∣selves to the wonder, even, of their adversaries: but, when this formality was over, they were called on Friday, April 20, before Dr. Weston (who had sat president at the disputations, and now sat with the rest in the nature of judges) to know whether they would subscribe to the articles, in the popish sense, and, upon their refusal, were condemned as heretics. There was no law, at that time in being, that could take away their lives: and the matters rested till Sep∣tember 12, this year; when Cranmer was convened, in St. Mary's church, before Brooks, Bishop of Glou∣cester, sitting as the Pope's sub-delegate, and the Doc∣tors Martin and Story, the King and Queen's com∣missioners. To these last he made his reverence; but shewed no respect to the first, as acting by commission from the Pope, whose supremacy he had abjured. Several articles were proposed to him, which he did not deny; but stood upon his justification in point of doctrine. Upon the whole, he was cited before the Pope in eighty days: and, having expressed his wil∣lingness to do so, if the King and Queen would give him leave, he was remanded to prison. White, Brooks, and Holyman, Bishops of Lincoln, Gloucester, and Bristol, sitting by virtue of the legate's commission eight days after, condemned Ridley and Latimer to be degraded from their episcopal, priestly, and other ecclesiastical, orders, and to be delivered over to the secular arm for punishment. The sentence was executed; and they were burnt, on October 16, in the Town-ditch over against Baliol college.</P>
<P>Gardiner died, on November 12, at midnight, to the no small grief of the Queen, who lost in him her
<PB N="222" REF="237"/>ablest counsellor, and one that had more influence, than all the rest, on the parliament; but to the great joy of the people. He had been at the opening of the parliament on Monday, October 21, and declared the cause of its meeting to be granting aid to their Majesties: but not being able to attend the house above two days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox, in his Martyrology, tells a story which he pretended to have had from good authority, that the same day on which Ridley and Latimer suffered, Gardiner would not go to dinner till his ser∣vants, who were posted on the road for that purpose, had brought him notice that the faggots were kindled about them: that this bar∣barous fancy made the dinner be kept back till four o'clock in the afternoon, although the old Duke of Norfolk was uneasy for staying so long: that when Gardiner heard the two prelates were burning, he was transported at the news, and went immediately to dinner, but was suddenly seized at table, and thence carried to bed, where he continued fifteen days, without voiding any thing by urine, or otherwise, which caused his tongue to swell.—What is faithfully related above, is sufficient to confute this tragical relation, with re∣spect to his confinement. Besides, the Duke of Norfolk, there mentioned, died on August 25 the preceding year; and Bishop Goodwin relates that Gardiner died of the gout, and not of a sup∣pression of urine. He is said to have felt some remorse in his last mome<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, and to have exclaimed, "I have finned with Peter, but I have not wept with Peter." This prelate, though he took the surname of Gardiner, was natural son of Lionel Wideville, Bishop of Salisbury, and brother to Elizabeth, consort to Edward IV.</NOTE>, the Lord Treasurer seems, in virtue of his office, to have supplied the place of Speaker of the house of Lords, during the rest of the session, and at last, by the Queen's orders, declared the par∣liament dissolved, without any particular commission for these purposes. The great seal was put into the custody of Sir Nicholas Hare, till the beginning of January; when Ely and Paget being baulked of their pretensions to the post, though the Emperor wrote in their favour, Heath Archbishop of York was made Lord Chancellor, by Pole's recommendation. It was not thought proper, that the Princess Elizabeth, al∣though she conformed to the Romish religion, should be about cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, or in town, whilst the parliament was
<PB N="223" REF="238"/>sitting, lest the nobility and gentry should shew her too much respect and affection: and she was sent away from Greenwich, on Friday, October 18, to her country-house, about thirty miles from London, to pass the winter. Her way lay through the city: and in passing the streets, she was followed and huzza'd by prodigious crowds of people of all ranks, to the no small displeasure of the Queen; who did not find her sister's absence any way lessen the opposition made to her measures in parliament. She was very uneasy at the accounts she received from Flanders, of her husband's assiduity in visiting younger ladies than her∣self; and resolved to get him back from thence if possible. Nothing was so likely to procure his return, as to get him crowned, and the government put into his hands: she did her utmost to carry these points, but could not obtain the consent of parliament. The bull of Pope Paul IV. confirming what Cardinal Pole had done, for assuring the possession of abbey and church lands to the laity who possessed them, was read before both houses, on the second day of the session: but it did not remove the ill humour of the Commons, nor make them more liberal in their supplies.</P>
<P>Mary had applied all the money, she could scrape together, to supply her husband's necessities, and left the vast arrears due to her late brother's and her own servants of the houshold unpaid; she was involved too in other heavy debts, and yet continually launching out into new expences. She had lately re-edified a Fran∣ciscan convent at Greenwich; was going to build another for the Dominicans, and a third for the Car∣thusians: she designed likewise to found as many abbeys, as the lands, of such as had been dissolved, still remaining in the crown, would endow. It was with an ill grace, that, whilst she was thus alienating her ordinary revenue, she applied to parliament for an extraordinary aid to pay her debts, particularly those

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="224" REF="241"/>of the houshold; in which probably a good number of the house of Commons were personally interested. Notwithstanding this circumstance, and the artifices of her minister, with the pompous harangues, display∣ing the services, which the Queen and her husband had done to the nation, when the Comptroller and Secre∣tary Petre, with the rest of the committee appointed to consider of the supply, had presented a bill to the house, for the grant of a subsidy of four shillings in the pound, payable in two years, and two-fifteenths, it met with a very strong opposition. Very free speeches were made on the occasion: and it appeared in an odious light, that she should come to the laity for the payment of her debts, and the supply of her extravagance, when she was squandering away the trea∣sure and revenue of the crown upon ecclesiastics. This objection lay equally against another bill, she had at heart, though it was postponed till the expected supply was granted: and the Queen, being afraid of losing both, thought proper to send a message, on October 30, to the Commons, by Secretery Petre, declining the two-fifteenths, and desiring only the subsidy.</P>
<P>Accordingly it was granted, though an hundred members were absolutely against giving any supply. The Queen then, on November 19, sending for both houses to Whitehall, acquainted them with her resolu∣tion of making a cession of the <HI>first fruits</HI> to the church, and resigning the impropriations in her hands to the Legate's disposal, and desired them to pass an act for these purposes. This was a point, in which no inte∣rest but her own was immediately concerned; and yet the bill, which at first contained a surrender thereof to the Pope, though afterwards altered in this particu∣lar, was debated for a fortnight together; meeting with such difficulties, that all the intrigues, treaties, managements, threats, and promises that could be used, were scarce sufficient to remove them, and the ministers durst not venture upon any other act to the prejudice
<PB N="225" REF="242"/>of the subject. The Queen had another subject of vexation given her by the Commons; who, upon a di∣vision, threw out a bill for attainting the persons, and for forfeiting the estates of the Duchess of Suffolk, and all other Protestants, who had, since her accession, sled abroad, and taken refuge at Francfort, Strasburgh, and others towns in Germany, if they contemptuously refused to return home, upon the King's and Queen's letters recalling them, or upon open proclamation made to that effect. No house of Commons had ever ap∣peared so refractory before: and the Earl of Pembroke, the Master of the Horse, the Comptroller, with other of her favourites, were treated with so much contempt, on the occasion, and her own conduct so freely censured, that, unable to bear contradiction any longer, she put, on December 9, a premature end to the parliament. The clergy granted her a subsidy of six shillings in the pound, payable in three years by equal portions; and expected to have their jurisdiction, dignity, and re∣venues restored to them; the Legate recommended it, the Queen supported it with her instances, but neither prevailed.</P>
<P>The time assigned to Cranmer (who was all the while closely confined in <HI>Bocardo,</HI> the north-gate pri∣son in Oxford) for his appearance at Rome expiring on December 10,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Archbishop Cranmer recants, and is burn∣ed.</NOTE> he was pronounced contumacious: and the Pope, on December 11, provided Pole to the see of Canterbury; constituting him ad∣ministrator thereof, till he should be consecrated, and then appointing him Archbishop, with full power and jurisdiction. That see had been vacant ever since Cran∣mer's conviction of treason: but the Pope, having ex∣communicated and deprived him for heresy, insisted that he should be put to death on this account. The judges telling the Queen, that this Prelate was, after his attainder, a dead man in law, and could not be tried for any other crime, she was forced to grant him
<PB N="226" REF="243"/>a pardon for treason, in order to have him prosecuted and burnt for heresy. A Papal commission was sent to Bonner and Thirlby for the trial of the Primate, and on conviction for degrading him; which last was done on February 14, 1556<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bonner, Bishop of London, and Thirlby, Bishop of Ely, being employed on this occasion, first cloathed Cranmer with a mitre, pall, and other archiepiscopal vestments, all made of coarse canvas. Thirlby wept bitterly during the whole scene, protesting to the Archbishop, that it was the most sorrowful action of his life; and that nothing, but the Queen's positive commands, could induce him to be present at the affliction and distress of a person with whom he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lived in perfect friendship: but Bonner, having insulted him with very indecent raillery, ordered him to be stripped of his ludi∣crous attire, according to the ceremony of degradation used in the church of Rome. See page 273 of vol. ii. of this work, for the form of degrading a priest, in the case of William Sautre.</NOTE>; and, on the 24th of the same month, the Queen issued a writ for the exe∣cution of that sentence. It was thought of mighty service to the Popish cause, to get him first to recant; and great endeavours were used for that purpose, with assurance of life, and other promises, the performance whereof was never intended. The business of those who teazed him on this subject, was, to draw him in at any rate; and they allowed him to frame a recan∣tation in such a manner, as might satisfy the govern∣ment, and not be very shocking to his own conscie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce: but, when he had signed one paper, they still wanted another to explain it, till he had signed at last six wri∣tings. The first imported, "That, since the Pope's authority had been received in England by act of par∣liament, he was content to submit to the laws there∣in, and to take the Pope for chief head of the church of England, <HI>so far as God's laws, and the laws and cus∣toms of the realm would permit.</HI>" There was no such reserve in the second, which contained "a submission to the Catholic church of Christ, to the Pope as its supreme head, to the King and Queen, and to all their laws and ordinances." The third expressed "a pro∣mise,
<PB N="227" REF="244"/>that he would promote the like submission in others, and submitted his book to the judgment of the Catholic church, and the next general council." The substance of the fourth was, "a general profession, that, with regard to the sacraments, and all points of the Christian religion and Catholic saith, he believed as the Catholic church did believe at that time, and had ever believed from the beginning." In the fifth, "he condemned all the heretical doctrines of Luther and Zuinglius:" and in the sixth, "he acknowledged his offences against the Pope, the King, the Queen, the realm, and the universal church, particularly in the divorce of Henry VIII. in blaspheming the eucha∣rist, in denying Christ's body and blood to be truly and really contained under the species of bread and wine, and in writing books against the truth." Notwith∣standing these different writings of submission and re∣cantation, it was resolved to put him to death: but this was kept secret, till he should first have made a public recantation in St. Mary's church, stronger than what he had signed in private, and particularly expres∣sing his belief of transubstantiation. He was carried to St. Mary's, on March 21, for that purpose: but instead of doing so, he "absolutely renounced all the above writings, which fear of death had caused him to sign; and declared that as his hand had offended there∣in contrary to his heart, it should, for that reason, be first punished. He went on, declaring against the Pope, with all his false doctrine, and maintaining the true doctrine of the sacrament, as laid down in his book against the Bishop of Winchester;" when he was interrupted by the Lord Williams, and hurried away to the stake, going to it with a chearful countenance. He there again expressed his repentance for the recan∣tation he had signed, and declared, that he died in all the opinions he had taught in his books. When fire was put to the pile, he stretched out his right hand, and thrust it into the flame; holding it there a good
<PB N="228" REF="245"/>while before the fire seized any other part of his body, and crying with a loud voice, "This hand hath of∣fended:" and what appeared surprising, his heart was found among the ashes, unconsumed and entire. His patience in the torment, and his courage in dying, were wonderful, and not outdone by any of the pri∣mitive martyrs. He was a man of an open and gene∣rous temper, exemplary and unaffected piety, of great abilities, learning and judgment; indefatigable in his searches after truth; abstemious in his own way of living, and spending all his revenue in charity to the poor, and pensions to learned men abroad; admired by all, and generally beloved for his gentleness, mode∣ration, humanity, and equanimity; constant to his friends in all circumstances of their affairs, and gene∣rous even to his enemies.</P>
<P>The day after his martyrdom, Pole was consecrated; and, on March 25, was invested with the pall,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Cardinal Pole made Archbi∣shop of Can∣terbury.</NOTE> in Bow-church, at London. He had held, some time before, a synod, by his legatine authority, for which he had the Queen's li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence: and, having assigned several persons to compile homilies, and trans∣late the New Testament, published, in February, some canons (as they were termed) of reformation.</P>
<P>Whilst the lives of martyrs in this country were daily spent in defending the doctrine, liturgy,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Proceedings of the English refugees abroad.</NOTE> and constitution of the re∣formed church of England, some of the English exiles abroad were labour∣ing to subvert, or at least to alter them according to their own fancies. The towns, where they chiefly settled, were Embden, Strasburgh, Zurich, Geneva, Basil, and Francfort; being allowed the exercise of their religion, and keeping up the face of an English church in their congregations. In the three first of these places they constantly used the English liturgy: but in Francfort, where the magistrates had assigned
<PB N="229" REF="246"/>them a church for divine worship. Whitingham, Goodman, and other preachers, set themselves to dis∣figure it, altering the confession and prayers, laying aside the liturgy, besides the reading of the psalms and chapters. When they had agreed upon a form of their own (which they endeavoured afterwards to ob∣trude upon the whole church of England) they invited the exiles at Strasburgh and Zurich to repair to Franc∣fort, and join in their worship, but met with a refusal; the latter having heard of their alterations, and signi∣fying their own resolution of maintaining the order of the church of England. Knox, who had lately pub∣lished some seditious pamphlets, in which the Empe∣ror, as well as the King and Queen of England, were equalled to Nero for cruelty and persecution, came thither from Geneva: and inflamed them so much a∣gainst the English liturgy, that all the endeavours of Grindal and Chambers for accommodating the diffe∣rence, by persuading them to retain the substance of it, though they laid aside the surplice, and other ceremo∣nies, proved ineffectual. Some of these separatists were for the Geneva office; but Know, who had pro∣cured a letter from Calvin to disparage the English liturgy, would needs have a form of his own; think∣ing himself full as able as Calvin to make a rule for his own congregation. At last they agreed on a mixed form, taken partly from the English, and partly from the Geneva offices, to be used for a time, till a better course could be taken. Dr. Richard Cox, late Dean of Christ church and Westminster, and one of the compilers of the English liturgy, coming about this time with many English exiles to Francfort, endea∣voured to revive the use of it: and, being a man of great learning, dignity, and authority, obtained an order from the senate, enjoining Whitingham, and the rest of his faction, to receive the English service. They chose rather to retire after Knox, who had quir∣ted the place, to avoid a prosecution for treason against
<PB N="230" REF="247"/>the Emperor: and Cox, restoring the liturgy, esta∣blished such an order in the congregation, as might keep up the face of an English church: Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehead being chosen principal Pastor, and Horn, Mullings, and Trahorn, appointed Hebrew, Greek, and Divi∣nity Lecturers. Whitingham, with the rest of the faction, retiring to Geneva, chose Knox and Goodman for their constant preachers; and, casting off the whole frame of the English reformation, adopted that of Ge∣neva, with some of Calvin's doctrines. Cox removing to Strasburgh, where his old friend P. Martyr lived, a new dissension arose in his absence. He had, in de∣fect of a Bishop, established, by general consent, the power of exercising ecclesiastical discipline in the chief Pastor, two other Presbyters, and four Deacons, as assistants: and had, upon Whitehead's quitting his charge, got Mr. Horn appointed chief Pastor. Ash∣ley, a gentleman of figure in the lay-sect of the flock, had, in the beginning of this year, been censured for some words expressing a contempt of the ministry: and not bearing this rebuke, made an appeal to the congregation, in which he had such interest, that a number of laymen, meeting together, sent two of their company to the chief Pastor, and consistory, re∣quiring them to proceed no further. Horn, support∣ed by Chambers, Treasurer of the contributions, ex∣cepted to this message, as sent from a private conven∣ticle of Ashley's partizans, and not approved by the general consent of the congregation: and resolved to insist upon the authority conferred upon him and his co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assessors by the rules of discipline which had been established. Ashley and his adherents protested against them, as an adverse party, and for that reason inca∣pable of acting in the case as judges: and set about forming a new scheme of discipline, calculated, as they pretended, for curbing the exorbitant power of the Pastor and his colleagues, who thereupon quitted their offices. The faction was proceeding to elect others in
<PB N="231" REF="248"/>their stead, and to establish their new discipline, when the magistrates of Francfort restored the old ones to their fomer authority by a public edict. Ashley's party opposed this, and set up the discipline they had devised, putting the supreme power in ecclesiastical causes into the hands of the congregation, and committing the disposal of the public money to certain officers, whom they termed Deacons. The breach being made wider by the contention between such as were for retaining the old, and those that would introduce the new dis∣cipline, the magistrates sent to Strasburgh for Dr. Cox, Dr. Sandys, and R. Bertie, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to make up the difference, both parties agreeing to submit the contro∣versy to their arbitration. A form of reconciliation was drawn up: but the partizans of the new discipline, being grown more numerous than the others, refused to submit to any establishment, by which the power of the diffusive body of the congregation, then of a fluc∣tuating nature, as exiles flocked to the place, or re∣moved their abode, might be called in question. They likewise elected new ministers: nor could all the re∣monstrances sent from Strasburgh deter them from going on in their measures for maintaining a division among persons, whom their common sufferings ought to have united, and for vilifying, in the eyes of fo∣reigners, the reformation, which had been carried on in their own country, and was daily recommended by the blood of martyrs. Such was the beginning of the several factions of the <HI>Puritans,</HI> against the rites and ceremonies of the church of England. These separations gave way likewise to innovations in doc∣trine; the exiles, which retired to Geneva, setting a∣bout a new translation of the Bible, and intermixing in their notes several heterodox notions, some of a se∣ditious nature, with regard to the civil magistrate, and others as scandalous in respect to episcopacy. The Calvinian doctrines of absolute predestination and re∣probation, making <HI>God the author of sin, and all the wick∣edness
<PB N="232" REF="249"/>upon earth,</HI> either in express terms, or by unde∣niable consequence, now also began to be propagated in pamphlets published by the resugees at Geneva.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the persecution in England con∣tinued to rage; to the great prejudice of the Queen's affairs, increasing the disaffection to her government, and rendering the disaffected desperate. Whatever pleasure she had received from the burning of Cran∣mer, in revenge of her mother's divorce, it was not an equivalent to the anxiety she felt on account of her husband's absence. Philip losing all hopes of having children by the Queen, and having taken a dislike to her person, shewed no inclination of returning to England: and had by degrees sent for his furniture, his guards, and all his servants from thence, leaving only some of his band of music with her, and Don Diego Agneda, who was obliged to stay to discharge the debts of his houshold. What vexed her the more, was, that he had no occasion for them in Flanders, since they were not ordered thither. She did all she could to prevent their going: and her ill success in this cost her abundance of tears, with all the re∣monstrances and complaints that could come from a woman tormented with an extreme passion, and having no way of revenging the ingratitude of a foreign husband, whom she had, out of ambition, and an unaccountable passion, chosen and purchased at an excessive expence, contrary to the sense of her people, the interest of the nation, the laws of the land, and the will of her father. The fury, however, raised on this occation, spent itself, not on him, but on her subjects, whom she hated, laying upon them the blame of his going abroad; because they would not consent, either to his being crowned, even in the quality of a consort, or to settle him in the sull enjoyment of the government, without which he could not make the figure he desired in England. Having little hopes of his return, unless she carried these points, she resumed
<PB N="233" REF="250"/>the design: and it was proposed to hold a parliament, in March, for this purpose.</P>
<P>One William Constable, alias Feather∣stone, a miller's son,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Plots against the Queen.</NOTE> much of an age with the late King Edward, and resembling him in person, had been publickly whipt about a year be∣fore in London, for pretending to be really that Prince: and, vanity rendering him incorrigible, he was taken up again for the same offence, condemned of-treason on February 26, and executed on March 3, being drawn to pieces by four horses in Smithfield. A dis∣covery was made, about the same time, that one of her chaplains had undertaken to kill her; but as the honour of her religion might suffer by the punishment of a Ro∣mish priest for so black a crime, the matter was smothe∣red. Another plot for robbing the exchequer of some Spanish money there lodged, with a view of employ∣ing it towards raising an insurrection, was discovered soon after by White, one of the conspirators: and John Throckmorton, Richard Uddel, Henry Peckham, John Daniel, W. Rossey, W. Stanton, John Dethic, John Bedel, were condemned for it, and executed. Some fled into France: and Sir Anthony Kingston was ap∣prehended, but died on the road in coming to London.</P>
<P>Endeavours were used to involve the Princess Eliza∣beth in this conspiracy; and, either upon this ac∣count, or because, upon a search of her house in town, some forbidden books had been found in a coffer, a guard had been set on her person. Besides Peckham, Worne her house-steward, and another of her house∣servants, were taken up and condemned: but what they said of her was so slight, that the Queen thought fit to send orders for discharging the guard, and to write her an account of the substance of their deposi∣tions, professing, that she did not believe a word of their contents, and recommending to her Pope and Gage, instead of her servants that had been condemn∣ed. This was accompanied with a present of a ring,
<PB N="234" REF="251"/>worth 6 or 700 crowns; and the Lord Loughborough was sent, with Sir Francis Englefield, to bring her up to court: but the Princess excused herself from going. There was at that time a project actually under consi∣deration, for transporting her either to Flanders or Spain; the execution of which was prevented by the intercession of the French ambassador with Car∣dinal Pole, who was of a pacific disposition, and averse to harsh measures. It was a circumstance very dangerous for the Princess, as well as the Earl of Devon, that they were universally beloved; and their names were made use of, without their know∣ledge, by every mad fellow that wanted to raise the populace; as was done sometime after at Ipswich; where they were proclaimed King and Queen of Eng∣land, and eight or ten of the rioters seized.</P>
<P>The Queen's jealousy was inflamed to the highest pitch at these conspiracies, and the knowledge of her being generally hated. She knew not who to trust, and took up all that she suspected, either of dabbling in these plots, or having favoured Wyat's insurrection. The Tower was filled with prisoners of distinction: and, though the Lord Thomas Howard and Captain Randel were soon dismissed, the Lord Bray and others were confined, till no colour was left to doubt of their innocence. She took care to be attended by her guards: and would let herself be seen only in her chamber by five women, passing the night in tears, complaints, and in writing letters to draw her husband over; in∣censed against all her subjects, astonished at the infide∣lity of those who had most of her confidence, and jealous of her servants, because they were generally either related or allied to the nobility, and likely to adopt their sentiments. Lord Clinton the Admiral (who did not indeed like the stiffness of the ceremonial at her court, and her ungracions behaviour to men of quality, and was apprehensive that her hatred of her people, and theirs in return, would, with its divisions, cause the ruin of the nation) though en∣trusted
<PB N="235" REF="252"/>with the command of the sleet, did not escape suspicion. Even the Lords of her council were in the same situation: and she was so enraged at them, that she could not forbear saying things shocking to them, and much to her own disadvantage; as, that <HI>she trusted none of them, but the Lord</HI> Montacute <HI>and the master of the horse,</HI> two young men, not well qualified to extri∣cate her out of difficulties.</P>
<P>Mary was, likewise, terribly apprehensive lest France should assist the malecontents. She had frequently demanded that the English refugees in that country, whom she represented as abominable heretics, should be delivered up to her: and, in her expostulations with the French ambassador on the subject, was so eager for being gratified therein, that the least contradiction would have thrown her into a fury. Henry I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. had too much magnanimity to comply with her demand, and give up a number of distressed exiles to her rage: but, faithful to his treaties, he satisfied himself with affording them a protection, and entered into no mea∣sures with them to her prejudice.</P>
<P>So many promises had Philip made, of coming over to England, that the Queen, though she infi∣nitely longed for such an interview, now believed none of them. Don John Mendosa came over, in July, with compliments to the Queen, and fresh assurances of her husband's return before the end of August. These were clogged with some conditions or precau∣tions, suggested by a pretended fear for the safety of his person during his stay, and expressed in a demand, that she would send over six or seven eldest sons of the prime nobility to Flanders, there to remain as hostages for his security: but this was impracticable; nor was it a point in which he could reasonably expect to be gratified. Mary looked on it as mere shuffling, and, in a fit of rage, tore his picture: but her revenge fell more heavily on the reformed; Bonner being the bloody instrument of her fury. Above eighty persons,
<PB N="236" REF="253"/>some of them gentlemen, being brought in one week from different parts of the realm to London, M. de Noailles the French ambassador says, thirty or forty were presently burnt in about the same space of time, all dying firm in their opinions. Nothing could be more impolitic than such persecution; for opinions are often rive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted by opposition. The indignation of all moderate people was roused by these proceedings; the surprising resolution, with which the victims suffered the most painful death, diffused a general notion of the sanctity, and inhanced the merit of the religion which they professed: so that this frantic zeal of their perse∣cutors contributed, in a great measure, to the subse∣quent establishment of the reformed religion.</P>
<P>Thinking to atone for her sins by some acts of piety, Mary erected a convent for Carthusians at Shene, and another for the Dominican or Black Friers in Smith∣field. The hospital of the Savoy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 353 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE> was now sitted up, and anew endowed by the Queen: her maids of ho∣nour, and other ladies about court, contributing to furnish it with bedding and other necessaries. The old convent at Sion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 286 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE> was replenished with nuns; and a sufficient estate in land assigned for their maintenance. Weston was forced to surrender his deanery of West∣minster; and the chapter being dissolved, the convent was on November 21 restored, consisting of fourteen monks, besides Dr. John Fecknam, who was made abbot at the same time. What had been left of the church and priory of St. John of Jerusalem<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See pages 20 and 113 of this volume.</NOTE> near Smithfield, was restored in the year following: and Sir Thomas Tresham being made grand prior, a libe∣ral endowment was assigned for the honourable sub∣sistence of the knights of the order. Sir Thomas, dying soon after, was succeeded by Sir Richard Shelley, who was the last grand master in England. Eight
<PB N="237" REF="254"/>other abbeys were likewise new founded; and endowed out of the lands of the dissolved monasteries, which as yet remained in the hands of the crown. Whether the vast expence of the buildings, necessary for the reception of the new colonies of religious destined to fill the re-edified convents, the sending supplies abroad to her husband and the Emperor, or any other ex∣pences, had exhausted her exchequer, the Queen either really was, or affected to be thought in great distress for want of money. The extraordinary methods, which she took to fill her coffers, and the disagreeable manner of retrenching her expences, caused a general discontent, which shewed itself, as on former occasions, in libels and satires, whereof many were thrown into the lodg∣ings of her counsellors, and dropped in her Majesty's own chamber<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other pieces, there were pictures representing her naked, meager, wrinkled, and withered, with flabby breasts hanging down to a disgustful length, sitting in a toyal chair, and on her head a crown, with M. R. and A. about it in great letters. In the first of these was written in lesser characters <HI>mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> in the second <HI>regina,</HI> and in the third <HI>angliae.</HI> At her feet, and about the painting, were drawn a great num∣ber of Spaniards sucking her: and underneath, in Italic characters, but in the English language, was a discourse specifying her being sucked so excessively by the Spaniards, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at she had no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing left but skin and bones. Then were more amply set forth, with great exactness, all the money, rings, jewels, presents, and aids of all kinds, with which she had underhand supplied her husband: and what is more surpri∣sing, in what place they were levied o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taken, by whom carried, where and to whom delivered, with many other circumstances and particulars, silling two sheets of paper. Mary was heartily vexed at this droll and satirical piece, and yet so extremely afraid of its being published, that, to keep it secret, she got in all the pictures that were found about her palace, chusing rather to suffer the affront than com∣plain of it openly, in order to discover the authors. These she ima∣gined to be some of her own council, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ho knew the most of her affairs; the exactness of the account sor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fving her conject<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce none else could come to the knowledge of so many particulars.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A war having broke out between France and Spain, Philip endeavoured to embark England in it, by flat∣tering the Queen with hopes of his speedy coming over: and sent, about the middle of December, some of his harbingers to prepare matters for his arrival.
<PB N="238" REF="255"/>Mary, to oblige him, ordered thirty-five or forty new ships to be built, and the Tower to be filled with bows, arrows, arquebuses, pikes, corselets, and other arms, of which it was at that time unprovided: and, to divert the hatred of the nation from the Spaniards to the French, the judges were instructed to load these last with calumnies, and to alarm the people with frightful representations of the calamities they might ex∣pect from a French invasion, encouraged by the refugees in that country holding correspondence with England. The Earl of Pembroke and Lord Grey were as eager for a war as Mary herself, being military men, sure to have the chief command of the forces, and wanting to touch her money: but the rest of the council were generally averse to a war that could not but be ex∣tremely prejudicial to the kingdom. They saw she could have no children, and did not care what became of the realm, if she could but put it into her husband's hands: they had no affection for Philip, and did not care to embark in a war for the service of a Prince, whose power was already formidable, and filled them with such suspicions, that they knew not well whether to wish him success or ruin. In case of the former, they were likely to be the first that would feel the in∣solence of victory, though they should be the first in∣struments of obtaining it, and a way would be paved for their perpetual servitude; and, if matters went ill, the nation would be so impoverished by taxes, to de∣fray the charges of war, that the crown would be in danger of falling a prey to the conqueror. They re∣presented to the Queen, that the nation was in great distress by a dearth, greater than had been known in an hundred years past, through the failure of the last harvest, the effect of too dry a summer, corn being raised to six or seven times its usual price, and the common people obliged to eat bread made of acorns; that the people, ever averse to taxes, would be more so in such a situation; that a war would be ruinous in
<PB N="239" REF="256"/>every respect, and was particularly dangerous when they had as much to fear within the realm as without. These representations had no other effect on Mary, than to throw her into a violent passion, and provoke her to a declaration, that if France broke with her husband, she would, whatever was the consequence, execute her father's treaties with the Emperor, and defend the Low Countries.</P>
<P>A. D. 1557.] Though Cardinal Pole had more of the Queen's confidence than any of them,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The bones of Bu∣cer and Fagius dug up at Cambridge.</NOTE> he acquiesced in the same opi∣nion with the other counsellors; he loved quiet, and wished the public tranquillity; but was too languid in his opposition to destructive measures. he had really more authority than he desired; but was so timorous in exerting it, in matters not only of great but little importance, that he seemed to be as much afraid of the least Lord of the council, as he could have been of Henry VIII. had that Prince been still living; and on all occasions, after a modest declaration of his sentiments, referred every thing to the council. Even in religion, though his particular province, he let the Bishops and ordina∣ries proceed to acts of cruelty, equally contrary to his judgment and inclination. He had been formerly suspected of favouring Luther's doctrines; and Paul IV. the present Pope, was his enemy. Thus obliged to be very cautious in his conduct, and to regulate it so as not to be liable to any just exception, he had, in his articles of visitation, inserted some, directing the cler∣gy to inquire after absentees from the church, and teachers of erroneous doctrines; and thought fit now to proceed against the dead, whom he could not hurt, to commute for his not exercising severity upon the living Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 124 of this volume.</NOTE>, the first professor of divinity, and the latter Hebrew lecturer,
<PB N="240" REF="257"/>in the university of Cambridge, had died there, and been buried, the one in the church of St. Mary, the other in that of St. Michael. Pole sent down com∣missioners to proceed with the shew of an extraordinary rigour against their dead bodies; and, on January 10, those two churches were interdicted. Their bodies being then taken out of the grave, they were cited to appear, or any body else in their behalf, that would dare to undertake their defence; witnesses were ex∣amined to prove their heterodoxy; and, after a deal of formality, prescribed by the canon law in such cases, the sentence was given, that the bodies should be car∣ried, under a guard of armed men, to the market∣place, and, being there chained to several stakes, should be burnt, together with as many of their books as could be procured. Pole had been chosen Chancellor of the university of Oxford; and a like commission was issued for proceeding in the same manner against the corpse of Peter Martyr's wife<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See pages 124, 132, 177, 193, of this volume.</NOTE>, who had been buried there, and was supposed to be of the same reli∣gion with her husband. But when the commissioners came to execute their powers, they could find no wit∣ness against her in this point; all that were examined professing that they did not understand her language, and therefore could not tell of what religion she was: nor had she read any books, as the Cambridge profes∣sors had, to supply the want of other legal evidence. This the commissioners certified to the Cardinal; and orders were sent to Dr. Marshall, Dean of Christ church, to take her body, and bury it in a common dunghill, she having been a nun, and broken her vow of celi∣bacy. It was about two years afterwards, upon Queen Elizabeth's accession, removed thence, and decently interred in the grave of St. Frideswide; their bones being so intermingled together, that there was no dan∣ger, whatever change should happen, of its being ever
<PB N="241" REF="258"/>treated again in the like unseemly manner. The ashes of Bucer and Fagius were also interred at Cambridge about the same time; a solemn commemoration of them being held there, their panegyric made by the university orator, and a sermon preached by Mr. Pil∣kington (afterwards Bishop of Durham) on the occa∣sion.</P>
<P>Mary, restrained by no saith of treaties, nor seruple of conscience,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Philip comes a∣gain to England.</NOTE> from breaking the peace with France, was for going to war im∣mediately; and her council, seeing her rage or passion for her husband would not suffer her to hearken to more moderate advice, were willing to give their consent for assisting, Philip with 6000 foot, and 600 horse, for the defence of the Low Countries, according to the treaty with the late Emperor; but were absolutely against a war, till the affairs of the realm were better settled. She resolved to give him all the succour in her power; though sick of vexation at the delay of his coming over, which had occasioned her a vast expence in keeping a fleet ready for convoying him to England. At last he signified to her plainly, "that he should defer his coming till she had declared war against France; that his honour lay at stake, and he could not come, unless assured of a good reception, and being obeyed as King, particularly in what related to the succours he might reasonably expect from Eng∣land; that all his dominions were likely to be inva∣ded; and, if he should come over, and not succeed in that point, but be forced to return without doing any thing, it would give a terrible blow to his repu∣tation, and be of infinite disservice to his affairs." Mary renewed her instances for his coming: assuring him, his presence was necessary to procure what he desired. She prevailed: and Philip arriving, on Sa∣turday, March 20, at Greenwich, <HI>Te Deum</HI> was sung; and Mary met him at the church of the Cordeliers, or
<PB N="242" REF="259"/>Observants (a branch of the Franciscan or Grey friers) whose monastery she had rebuilt there, on account of the orders having suffered much for their attachment to the cause of her mother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 417 and 429 of the preceding volume, and page 61 of this in the note.</NOTE>. They went on the 23d by water to the Tower, and thence through London to Westminster, thinly attended, and the people using no demonstration of joy, nor making any acclama∣tion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Upon Philip's arrival, proclamation was made over London, forbidding all persons accustomed to wear arms, to wear them for the future, or to have any bucklers or halberts, carried with them, as usual, or even to wear a sword longer than three quarters of an ell; a precaution taken either to prevent murders and other inconvenien∣cies, that might arise from quarrels between the English and the Spaniards of the King's retinue, or to give the latter an advantage in their weapons. The English gentlemen slighted the proclamation, laughing at it publickly; and in fact, after the coming of the Spaniards, and trying their mettle in a few rencounters, they generally wore longer s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ords than they had used bef re.—There had been fre∣quent bickerings between the English and Spaniards, when Philip was formerly in England. One of the most remarkable was at Kings<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on in Surry, on Corpus Christi day, June 22, 1555, when a Spaniard, on some affront, killing an Englishman, the whole town rose, with swords and clubs, to knock all the Spaniards on the head without dissi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction, even in the church, where they took re∣fuge: and the tumult was not appeased, until the murderer was hanged.</NOTE>. Cardinal Pole had quitted Greenwich in haste upon Philip's arrival, considering him as an enemy to the Pope, whose legate he was: and proposed to re∣tire into his diocese. Mary had assured the King, that he should, at his arrival, find all the great Lords gained to his mind; depending upon the force of money to produce this effect. Henry Nevil, Earl of West more-land, had not been at court since her coronation: but now he was sent for, with Francis Talbot and Edward Stanley, the Earls of Shrewsbury and Derby; though none of them were disposed to enter into the measures which her passion inspired. Almost every thing ne∣cessary
<PB N="243" REF="260"/>for a war was still to be provided; the Queen and the Spaniards were hated; discontent reigned over every part of the nation, and nothing but the assistance of France was wanting for the execution of the de∣signs of those that proposed to overturn her govern∣ment: yet she resolved rather to ruin herself, than not gratify her husband. She teazed her council every day on the subject: and on Thursday, April 1, after making a formal harangue to the Lords, insisted on their coming to a resolution. They debated the mat∣ter for two days; and, on Saturday, told her, "That they neither could, nor ought to, enter into a war; that France had been a good neighbour, had not aided her subjects in their rebellion, and had saithfully ob∣served her treaties; that all the wars with that country had been ruinous to England, and the last more so than the precedent; that the necessities of the realm, arising from a general famine this year, false coin, the impoverishment of the people, and the divisions about religion, were too great to render a war adviseable, and it was expressly contrary to the conventions for her marriage." The Queen replied in a great rage, that this answer was not agreeable either to their own duty, or to her desire: and, allowing them two days more for their consultation, ordered them to bring her one, more to her own and her husband's satisfaction. The best part of the council still stood out against all her menaces: though, after a week's dispute with her, some of the Lords of the council were inclined to com∣pound the matter, and, if a war was deferred till har∣vest, that the nation might not be starved for want of provisions, to come into it at Michaelmas. This was not agreeable to the views of Philip, who resolved not to visit England any more, unless he obtained an immediate declaration of war against France, and should effect a marriage between the Princess Eliza∣beth, and Emanuel Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bert Duke of Savoy, his

However, as the Princess was under such ob∣ligations to his good offices, he renewed, on this visit, his endeavours to accomplish the proposed marriage. He had brought over Marga∣ret Duchess of Parma, his natural sister, and his cousin-german Christina, daughter of Christian II. the expelled King of Sweden and Denmark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page <HI>385</HI> of vol. <HI>ii.</HI> of this work.</NOTE>, and widow of Francis Duke of Lorrain, to carry Elizabeth with them to Flanders. Philip was in love with the Duchess of Lorrain; and the little parties of shooting which they had fre∣quently together, as well as the sumptuousness of her retinues, and the great profusion of her table, which she was not able of herself to support, aroused Mary's jealousy, and gave her a vast deal of in∣quietude. Whether it was on account of her being out of humour on this occasion, or because a Swedish ambassador arrived, about Lady-day, with proposals of marriage from his master, Philip's sch me was not relished; though the Princess, having asked leave to go to her house in Norfolk, to be more out of the way, was refused that indulgence till after Whitsuntide. Francis de Noailles, Bishop of Dux, who had succeeded his brother Anthony in his embassy to the English court, had informed Elizabeth of Philip's designs; and she declared, that she would rather die than go to Flanders, or marry the Duke of Savoy. The Queen was so aversa to the proposal, that she would neither send for her sister from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, where she resided under a guard, nor suffer the two Duchesses to visit her there. Every moment of these ladies stay in England gave Mary grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> uneasiness, which was in some measure removed by the Duchess of Parma's deoa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure on April 29, and the Duchess of Lor∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s on the 8th of the nexth month.</NOTE>. John de Luna, governor of the castle of Milan, had a little before quitted the Spanish service; and retired into France. He had there informed the constable De Montmorency, that, being very intimate with Pichon, one of the King of Spain's principal ministers, and talking with him about the measures to be taken for making their master ab∣solute Lord of England, Pichon had told him, it had been already resolved, that, after the King went thither, it should be proposed to the English to make war upon Scotland with a great army: and under this colour, a good body of Spaniards being brought over, with the less suspicion, might be put into the sea-ports and
<PB N="245" REF="262"/>fortresses of the greatest importance. When Philip was once master of these, it would be no difficult matter for him, in conjunction with his venal creatures among the English, to reduce the rest of the kingdom: and Pichon was of opinion, that Ruy de Sylva, Philip's chief confident, would land in England, with the very troops he was at this time bringing from Spain. There was a very great probability in this scheme: and, though the Spaniards did not seem to be as yet in a condition to put it in execution, the constable thought fit to send advice of it to M. de Noailles; who commu∣nicating it to such as he thought proper, and knew to detest the Spanish government, rendered them still more averse to Philip's measures.</P>
<P>Mary, calling the council together, on April 8, declared publickly, that, if they did not agree to her measures, she should dismiss two-thirds of them; and Philip, if he did not carry his point, resolved to de∣part for Spain. The council, still unwilling to com∣ply, offered twice the number of men, and double the sums of money, stipulated in the treaties with the Low Countries, that they might not enter into an open war: but Philip said, "He had rather all the world should know they were embarked in his fortune, than have all the wealth in the nation." At last, an express from the Earl of Westmoreland broke the resolution, in which the council had hitherto persisted.</P>
<P>Mary's suspicions had, from the beginning of the reign,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Stafford's at∣tempt on Sear∣borough.</NOTE> fallen heavily upon the military gentlemen; and as they were deemed the most dangerous in case of any insurrec∣tion, arrested their persons on different pretences, keeping them for years together in loath∣some prisons, and confiscating their estates. Divers of that character, to avoid persecution, had taken re∣fuge in France, where, being stripped of their fortunes, they made a sorry shift to subsist: and finding all ap∣plication to that court for aid unsuccessful, were by
<PB N="246" REF="263"/>their necessities fit for any undertaking that could afford the least prospect of relief. The Lord Paget, judging it not impracticable to animate some of those refugees to an enterprise, which, being laid in France, would give a tolerable colour for a rupture with that crown, had, by the help of Dr. Wotton, the English ambassador at Paris, found out one Captain Thomas Stafford fit for their purpose: and they wrought upon him by their agents so effectually, that he undertook to surprise the castle of Scarborough, a place of conse∣quence and reputation, lying on the sea, in the North-Riding of Yorkshire, but garrisoned so weakly, and guarded, in appearance, with so little case, that the enterprise seemed very feasible. Stafford, getting some ships at Dieppe, and accompanied by thirty-four re∣fugees, landed at Scarborough; where the Earl of Westmoreland having intelligence of his strength and motions from Doctor Wotton, was ready to receive him: and being surrounded, upon his landing, be∣tween the castle and the sea, was obliged to surrender at discretion. Stafford, with five or six others, were brought up to London: but the rest were all hanged in the country, denying unanimously they had any foreign succour or encouragement. Stafford owned at his trial, that he had got his design communicated to the King of France and the constable Montmorency; but he had never seen either: and, upon their both rejecting it, he had, in despair, attempted it with the few men he could get together. He was con∣demned, and, on May 28, beheaded on Tower hill: and three of his accomplices were, the next day, hanged at Tyburn, only two of the thirty-five being pardoned. At his execution he declared, that he meant the liberty of his country, and died with great resolution: but no remonstrances could prevail with him to ask the King's and Queen's pardon, or to ac∣knowledge that he had given them any offence. This so enraged the Queen, that, sending the next day to
<PB N="247" REF="264"/>the Tower, she caused his corpse, which had been bu∣ried in the chapel, to be dog up, drawn to Tower-hill, and there cut into quarters, and his bowels to be burnt; the populace laughing all the time at the ridiculous vengeance. beholding it as a madness and cruelty worthy of such a Princess.</P>
<P>The Scarborough affair had the inten 'ed effect: and the council,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Philip involves England in a war with France.</NOTE> resolving upon an open war, thought fit to assign it as the chief cause of their resolution. Great preparations had been made for it: and, to defray the expences, the Queen had raised 150,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> by levying the second year's subsidy before the time settled by parliament, which became a new subject of complaint: and either mortgaged the de∣mesnes, or sold the lands, of the crown, to all that would purchase them; making no distinction between the old estates of the crown, and the new ones lately vested in it by the suppression of monasteries, which though, in her fits of conscience, she had made a so∣lemn promise of returning them to the church, were now sold for her husband's use, and to propagate a war in christendom.—According to the ancient custom, a herald was sent over, to denounce war against the King of France. Henry II. accepting the defiance, forbade the herald to say more, "since he came from a woman, of whom it was not decent for a Prince of honour, virtue, and generosity, to take the revenge in words; though, in the case of another person, he should have used and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rent language: but still hoped, God would shew the justice of his cause by the event; protesting that she was the author of all the evils, which the war should bring upon christendom."</P>
<P>A war being thus entered into with France, to pre∣vent any disturbance at home, several gendemen, who had the misfortune to be suspected, were taken up and carried to the Tower, hoodwinked and muffled, that they might not be known, according to the Spanish
<PB N="248" REF="265"/>fashion: others were taken into the service, and even Sir Peter Carew, who had been long persecuted, was offered the command of 500 men; which he declined, though, to avoid the charge of disaffection, he ex∣pressed himself ready to serve as a volunteer. The city of London was ordered to raise 1000 men, well provided with arms and ammunition; the soldiers that were pressed going abroad with an ill will: and troops were daily transported to Calais, where an army of 1000 horse, 5000 foot, and 2000 pioneers, rendez∣voused under the Earl of Pembroke. Philip arrived there, on July 5, in his way to Brussels; having been accompanied to Dover by the Queen; who, after the departure of her troops, raised an extraordinary guard for the safety of her person.</P>
<P>The action at St. Quintin, commonly called the battle of St Laurence,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Battle of St. Quintin.</NOTE> as happen∣ing on August 10, where the French were entirely routed with a very great loss of men, and a num∣ber of their chief nobility either slain or taken prisoners, was a terrible blow to France, and threw the whole kingdom, as well as Paris, into the utmost consterna∣tion; from which however they had time to recover, by Coligni's desperate defence of St. Quintin for seventeen days, which the Spaniards expected, as being untenable, would have immediately surrendered after the victory obtained there: and Philip gained no very considerable advantages from his victory, on the side of Flanders, though it procured him great advantages in Italy; the King of France being obliged to recal part of his army employed there.</P>
<P>The Pope, resenting greatly the Queen of England's engaging for her husband's sake in the war against France, had deprived Cardinal Pole of his legatine powers; and, under pretence of calling the Cardinals about him, cited him to appear at Rome. It was necessary to have a legate in England that understood the language, customs, and manners, of the country:
<PB N="249" REF="266"/>and, few offering themselves with these qualifications to his choice, he raised Peter Peyto, a Franciscan Frier, of an ancient English family, and the Queen's confessor, June 14, to the dignities of Cardinal and Legate. The Queen resolved not to admit the new Legate: but Pole, having advice of what passed, laid aside the marks of his legatine authority, and abstained from the exercise of his faculties. The victory of St. Quin∣tin, and the recal of the French forces from Italy, obliging the Pope to think of an accommodation with Philip, a peace was made in September: and Paul, growing less eager in the prosecution of Pole, waved insisting upon his repair to Rome, and at last restored him to his former legation. The Pope had, in his wrath, thrown out speeches, detracting from the or∣thodoxy of Pole's religious sentiments: and this per∣haps made his Eminence, not only grant a commission for proceeding against the reformed in his diocese of Canterbury, but to signify also to the Queen, and to deliver to the secular arm, such as had been con∣victed.</P>
<P>A. D. 1558.] The English commonly kept a very strong garrison, during the summer-time, in Calais: but as it was in a manner surrounded by water, and the marshes were unpassable in winter, they left, at this season, but a small number of men in it, to save charges; and the loss, which the French had suffered at St. Quintin, rendered them the more negligent at this juncture. Henry, having got together a considerable army, resolved to besiege it;<NOTE PLACE="inter">The loss of Calais.</NOTE> and the Duke of Guise came with his army, on New-year's day, before the forts of St. Agatha and Newnhambryg; the town not being approachable, till these were taken. Being weakly garrisoned, they were easily reduced: and the Duke of Guise erecting, on January 4, a battery of fifteen pieces of cannon against the castle, a large breach was soon made in the walls:
<PB N="248" REF="267"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="249" REF="268"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="250" REF="269"/>but, there being a large and deep ditch before it, sup∣plied with water by the river Hannes, and swelled at full tide from the sea, the garrison thought it impassa∣ble. But D'Andelot, Colonel-General of the French infantry, in the beginning of the night, running a trench to the side of the ditch, made a lodgment there, with 1200 fusileers; and used such diligence to drain the water, that it was passable in the morning at ebb, and the castle was taken by assault. The Lord Went-worth, Governor or the place, seeing no prospect of any succour, and having only 300 sound men left of his garrison, surrendered it, on January 8, upon con∣dition, that the townsmen and soldiers, leaving their effects to the mercy of the conquerors, might retire, the first to what place they pleased, and the latter (ex∣cept himself and fifty more, who were to be treated as prisoners) to England. The Duke of Guise, follow∣ing his blow, marched to Guisnes, which he battered so furiously with thirty-five large cannon, that he soon made three breaches: and the noise of the artillery was heard as far as Antwerp. The Lord Grey was in the place with a garrison of 1100 men, and, on January 20, stood a general assault, in which he lost 4 or 500 of his soldiers: and, retiring with the rest into an old castle, surrendered it on the 22d, himself and the rest of the principal officers remaining prisoners of war, and the others having liberty to march off whither they pleased. The garrison of Hammes quitted the place upon the approach the French army. Thus was Eng∣land deprived, in less than a month, of conquests, which the English had retained for more than 200 years; France thinking the attempt all that time im∣practicable: and lost the last foot of ground of what she had ever possessed on the continent. The loss of Calais so affected Queen Mary, that she said it would be found engraved on her heart after her decease.</P>
<P>This disaster greatly diminished the reputation of the
<PB N="251" REF="270"/>nation abroad: and Philip, pretending to lay it to heart,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The council de∣cline attempt∣ing its reco∣very.</NOTE> offered soon after his assist∣ance for the recovery of the place, before i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fortifications were repaired. The coun∣cil in their answer, on February 1, repre∣sented "their inability of accepting the offer, since the enterprise would require an army of 20,000 men, the charge whereof, in the present situation of affairs, they could not expect to raise a sum sufficient to defray upon the uncertain hopes of success." However, to provide for a defence of the realm, against the French and Scotch, the parliament meeting on Thurs∣day, January 20, the convocation gave a subsidy of eight shillings in the pound, payable in four years, by equal portions: and the Commons, besides a subsidy of four shillings per pound on land, and two shillings and eight-pence on goods, for one year, granted a fif∣teenth. An act passed for "confirming all the sales and grants of the crown-lands, either already made by the Queen, or that should be made by her for seven years to come;" a sufficient time for alienating, and finding persons to purchase, the rest of her demesnes. On this occasion, one Mr. Copley, a member of the house of Commons, expressing his "fears that the Queen might thereby give away the crown from the right inheri∣tors," was ordered to withdraw till the house had considered of his words; and these being deemed <HI>irre∣verent</HI> to her Majesty, he was called in; and begging pardon for his offence, if it was one, desired it might be imputed to his youth and inexperience. He was committed to the custody of the Serjeant at Arms, till the Speaker had acquainted her Majesty with his of∣fence, and interceded in the name of the house for his pardon: and the Queen, after insisting upon his being examined <HI>whence what he had said had sprung</HI> (which probably was from the general jealousy, entertained all over the nation, of a design to set Philip on the throne after her decease, and to disinherit the Princess
<PB N="252" REF="271"/>Elizabeth) promised to consider the request of the Commons in his behalf. This report was made on Monday, March 7; but nothing further appears to have been done in this matter: the parliament, after passing two acts for the defence of the realm, settling the proportion of horses, armour, and weapons, which every man was to be provided with in their respective stations, and making a provision for the due taking of musters, being prorogued that afternoon to Novem∣ber 5, next following.</P>
<P>These precautions were not unnecessary; for upon the first breaking out of the war, the King of France had sent to the Queen Regent of Scotland, desiring her to raise all its force, and make an irruption into Eng∣land. She was sufficiently inclined to comply with his desires: but there were some difficulties in the way; the gentry having been lately alarmed by an attempt for subjecting them to a standing tax, for the pay of a standing army of mercenaries, to be kept ready on all emergencies for the defence of the realm, which they were obliged to in their own persons by their tenures; and the people in general complaining that the great offices of state, and the places of the greatest trust and profit, were put into the hands of Frenchmen. The project of the tax was coloured by the convenience which gentlemen would find in staying at home, with∣out neglecting their affairs, and exposing their persons in a time of war: but the Scotch, dreading the conse∣quences that a standing army might have, in making the rest of the nation drop that warlike temper, which had been their sure and glorious defence in all past ages, and not caring to be exposed equally to attempts for enslaving them at home, and to the invasion of fo∣reigners, without means in their hands to resist both, shewed so much resolution in opposing it, that the scheme was for a time laid aside.</P>
<P>There appeared no reason for any apprehensions from
<PB N="253" REF="272"/>the parliament of Scotland, till De∣cember 14,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Marriage of Mary Queen of Scotland with the Dauphin.</NOTE> when a letter from the King France, desiring that some per∣sons of the first quality might be sent to Paris, to attend at Francis the Dauphin's affiancing and marriage with Mary their Queen, and to transact what should be necessary on the occasion, was present∣ed to the states of that kingdom. Commissioners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were James Boton Archbishop of Glasgow, David Panter Bishop of Ross, Robert Reid Bishop of Orkney, George Lesley Earl of Rothes, Gilbert Kennedy Earl of Cassils, James Lord Fleming, George Lord Seton, James Stewart Prior of St. Andrew's (afterwards Earl of Murray) and Sir John Erskine of Dun.</NOTE> were immediately appointed for that purpose; and the arti∣cles of marriage were signed, on April 19, providing "that if the Dauphin died before he succeeded to the crown of France, Mary, surviving him, should have a jointure of 30,000 <HI>livres turnois</HI> a year; but, if he came to be King, it was to be increased to 60,000, or to as much as any Queen of France had ever enjoyed, to be paid duly wherever she resided; in which point she was to have her option, and carry off with her all her jewels and effects. The Dauphin was to take the name and title of King of Scotland, to have his arms quartered with those of that kingdom; and when he came to be King of France, to bear the titles and arms of both realms under one crown. In case of issue by the marriage, the eldest son was to inherit both crowns; but if only females sprung from it, the eldest daughter was to be Queen of Scotland, and have, as a daughter of France, 400,000, and each of the youngest daughters 300,000 crowns for their portion. The ceremony of the affiancing having been performed sometime before, Francis and Mary were solemnly wedded on Sunday, April 24: and four days after, all the Scottish com∣missioners (except the Bishop of Ross, who did not come to France with the rest) swore allegiance in the name of the estates of Scotland, to the Queen, and to
<PB N="254" REF="273"/>the King Dauphin, on account of his being her consort.</P>
<P>The French at that time had views of enslaving Scot∣land, which they were ashamed or afraid of owning; but which appear evidently in three instruments, that the young Queen was made to sign privately on April 4, twenty days before the solemnization of her mar∣riage. In the first of these, "she conveyed after her death, without issue, to the King of France and his successors, and made them a donation <HI>causa mortis</HI> of the kingdom of Scotland and its appurtenances, with all the rights that she either had at present, or might hereafter have, to the kingdom of England, and all the lands and cominions thereto belonging." The se∣cond seems to have been a kind of mortgage, "giving the King of France, after her decease without children, possession of the realm of Scotland, till he should be reimbursed a million of pieces of gold, or such greater sum as should appear due to him, as well for her edu∣cation and entertainment in France, as for his expences in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> defence of Scotland against the power of Eng∣land." In the third writing, of the same date with the two former, and confirming them both, she declares, "that finding the deputies of the estates of Scotland were, out of favour to certain persons, obliged by their instructions to insist on the kingdom's descending, for want of heirs of her body, to some Lords of the coun∣try, taking thereby from her, the true Queen, all liber∣ty and power to dispose thereof; and not daring, for certain reasons and just fears, to contradict such their resolution at present, being at a distance from her realm and the sight of her subjects, not assured of the sorts and strong holds of the country; and her open opposition to it being likely to produce great troubles and com∣bustions to the ruin of her realm, especially whilst a war was carrying on between France and England, she there∣fore protests, that, whatever consent she should give to the articles and instructions sent by the estates of her
<PB N="255" REF="274"/>realm, particularly, <HI>in the point of the lineal succession of her crown,</HI> in case of her dying without issue, she still intends that her disposition thereof, in favour of the King of France, shall remain in full force, notwith∣standing her agreement and consent, or any she should afterwards give, to the said articles and instructions, as being directly contrary to her genuine will and inten∣tion."</P>
<P>As Mary was of too tender an age to judge for her∣self, it was impious and cruel to entangle her in such acts of prevarication, and breach of faith; which, if known, must render her odious to her own subjects. Here at least was laid the foundation of that claim of the crown of England, which, being soon followed by some other acts of a like meaning, into which she was drawn by the council of France, the authority of her husband (whom she wedded on April 24) and the advice of her ambitious uncles, proved the chief cause of all her troubles, and the violent death she at last suffered.</P>
<P>During these transactions at Paris, the council of England resolved to fit out a large fleet, with a con∣siderable land-force on board, in order to make de∣scents on the coasts of France, and particularly to seize Brest in Brittany, hoping perhaps it might, in a treaty of peace, serve as an equivalent for Calais. But they were so slow in their preparations, and so lit∣tle careful to keep the secret, that the fleet did not sail till the latter end of July: and, in the mean time, the French had discovered their design. They found Brest too well fortified and guarded to make any attempt upon the place; and sailing to Conquet, plundered and burnt the town, with the monastery of St. Mahé, and some adjoining villages: but the Flemish forces, marching further up into the country, were attacked in the height of their pillaging, by M. de Kersimon, a Breton nobleman, at the head of 6000 militia troops, and defeated with the loss of 500 of their number. Ten English ships, commanded by Vice Admiral Malin,
<PB N="256" REF="275"/>did, on July 13, a much greater service,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Battle of Gravelines.</NOTE> in the battle between the Mareschel de Fer∣mes, Governor of Calais, and the Count of Egmond, Governor of Flanders, near Gravelines. The victory was doubtful, when these ships, passing accidentally off the coast, and drawn by the noise of the firing to the place of the engagement, came up the river, by the advantage of an high tide: and, ly∣ing in the middle of it, played with their cannon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o terribly upon the French troops, that they were routed with the loss of 5000 men. As the French army, thus ruined, had been drawn out of Calais, and other neighbouring garrisons, a fair opportunity now offered for the recovery of that place, in which the fleet and forces that plundered Conquet might have been very useful, and were ready for the service: but the coun∣cil had no vigour, and Philip was indifferent for every thing that regarded the interest of England.</P>
<P>The Queen of England had never been perfectly well since her supposed pregnancy: and, though the lump of flesh,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen Ma∣ry's death,</NOTE> which contributed to that mistake, had been taken away, a foundation was laid for a dropsy. This was neglected at first, she being so desirous of appearing to be in health (which she thought necessary to keep her disaf∣fected subjects in awe) that she would consult nobody but a young physician, much in her confidence, but of little judgement or experience: and the disease gather∣ed strength by degrees. She had expected her husband over in May with so much assurance, that she had sent his horses and wardrobe to wait on him at Harwich and Dover, and the Lord Admiral Clinton to the latter of these places, to prepare and command the fleet destined for his convoy: but, after every thing was in readiness for his passage and reception, she found, to her inexpressible grief, that his voyage was not only stopped by the pressure of his affairs, but that, as soon as these were settled, he had, resolved to
<PB N="257" REF="276"/>embark for Spain. This neglect struck her to the heart: and being accompan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with other subjects of anxiety, the disorders of government, the ill-success of all her enterprises, the hatred of her people, the continual dangers of insurrections and invasions, the emptiness of her exchequer, the distress of the realm and of all her affairs, the loss of Calais, to the great dishonour and ruin of her credit abroad, produced a poorness of blood, a dejection of spirits, and a slow, yet visible decay. The impetuosity of her passions, added to the ordinary effects of a continual uneasiness, the inveteracy of her constant distemper, and the most unhealthy autumn that perhaps ever was known<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At that time there raged a pestilential fever and quartan ague, which seized those chiefly who were advanced in years, and cut off greater numbers than any former plague is said to have done. Divers places were left void of justices, and men of worth, to govern the kingdom; and the mortality among the clergy was so great, that thirteen Bishops died, many parishes had no divine service, and curates could not be got for money. Much corn was left on the field for want of labourers to get it in. The contagion proved satal also to physicians, and two belonging to the Queen died a little before her demise.</NOTE>, threw her into a lingering sever, which wore her away so visibly, that all about her person thought her life in great danger. In this condition she thought of a suc∣cessor; and hating her sister, would have excluded her, had it been practicable. Philip and a Spanish govern∣ment were too odious to the nation, and too much the aversion of her own council, to have any room for hopes, that a disposition in his favour could take place but by mere force, which could not be used in the present juncture. To bequeathe the crown to the Queen Dauphiness Mary of Scotland, was to perpetuate a war between Christian powers, when on the point of being terminated; to aggrandize his and her mortal enemy; and to do an infinite prejudice to the affairs of an husband, whom, in despight of his ingratitude, she loved to distraction. Cardinal Pole was descended of
<PB N="258" REF="277"/>the royal family, much in her graces, and likely to be supported by all the Popish interest: but he was timid in all his actions, his head full of scruples, and, through a defect of ambition, courage, and vigour, unquali∣fied to undertake or conduct an enterprise of such a nature, as the usurpation of a crown, and the sub∣verting of the constitution of a powerful kingdom. Besides, he was in so very bad a state of health, that his life was in danger: and she found, after all, that she could not alter the succession without an act of parliament. There was one in being, and its second session began on November 5; but there was little likelihood of its coming into any such measures, when the Commons disputed about granting a subsidy, which had been, on the 14th of that month, demanded of them in the Queen's name, and recommended by the Lords, and the necessity whereof for the safeguard of the realm was evident. In fact, none was voted be∣fore its dissolution by her death, on November 17, at St. James's, a little before day-light; Cardinal Pole expiring about sixteen hours after her. Mary's de∣mise was looked upon as a signal deliverance, as it happened on the eve of a peace; which would have enabled her and Philip to pursue their scheme for sub∣verting the constitution of the kingdom, and enslaving a disunited people, hopeless of any foreign succours, and which had been long fixed for the time of its exe∣cution. Her funeral was solemnized, on December 14, at Westminster, with a mass of <HI>requiem,</HI> in the usual form; and her body was interred in the chapel of Henry VII. her grandfather<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Besides her founding some religious houses, and returning im∣prooriations, tenths, and first fruits, to the church, Mary built the <HI>public school,</HI> at Oxford, which continued for that service till the time of James I. when they were taken down to make way for a much nob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r structure. During her reign, and perhaps by the encourage∣ment of her example, two new colleges were added to the univer∣sity of Oxford. Sir Thomas Pope, one of Henry VIII.'s abbey visitors, obtained a grant of a small college in Oxford, founded by the Bishop and Prior of Durham for a nursery to their monastery.

<P>The character of Mary may be easily deduced from her actions,<NOTE PLACE="inter">and character.</NOTE> as well pub∣lic as private, before-mentioned. John White, Bishop of Winchester, in his funeral panegy∣ric upon her, celebrates her devotion, zeal for Popery, benefactions to the clergy, and resignation to the will of Heaven, when, weary of the world, she lay upon her death-bed, and received the sacraments; this is the sum of what those, who had tasted most of her kind∣ness, were able to say in her favour. Mary was not formed to please; she had nothing of the amiable wo∣man either in her person or behaviour; was stiff, for∣mal, reserved, four, haughty, and arrogant; her sace plain and coarse, without any soft features to smooth its roughness, or any insinuating graces to shade its de∣fects: every thing in her looks, her air, her carriage, and manner, was forbidding She did not care, or did not know how to oblige: did all things in an im∣perious and grating way, choosing to be feared rather than to be loved. She had been b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed up to learning by her father: but it did not serve either to improve her mind, to inform her judgment, or to remove her pre∣judices. She pretended, or perhaps fancied herself, to have a great deal of religion; it was the point in which she fixed her chief glory; and she had really as much of it, as her inordinate pride or passions would give her leave to retain: but it was a religion of a low kind,
<PB N="260" REF="279"/>that of a bigot, and choaked with superstition. Hence arose the inconsistency of her conduct, in resuming the title of <HI>supreme head of the church of England,</HI> after she had laid it aside with a seeming abhorrence; and in other respects, that delicacy and tenderness of conscience, which induced her to declare, in the most solemn man∣ner, to her parliaments, and to all the world, that she could not, with the safety of her soul, retain any church-goods in her hands, allowing her afterwards to sell them, for supplying her husband with the money, arising from their sale, to carry on a bloody war between Christian potentates. She did not want understanding: but her violent passions were such a drawback upon it, that she had a very small stock of good sense left upon the ballance: and she had so little regard to her own dignity and decorum, as to admit of formal consulta∣tions for burning the body of her father, and cutting off the head of her sister. Her fundamental defects were the same with her father's, an unmeasurable pride, a surious impetuosity, the effect of her violent passions; a wilfulness to which she would have sacrificed the world; and an insatiable avarice: she equalled him at least in all these respects, but wanted his judgment in the exercise of them, and, if possible, outdid him in arbitrary cruelty. Henry made all his passions give way to his politics, to his own reputation, and to the interests of the kingdom: Mary's conduct shewed her to be equally regardless of her own honour, and the good of her people. Besides those shocking scenes of cruelty, exhibited to the very end of her reign, in burning people for religion, her suspicions reduced the nation to the same miserable condition it had experi∣enced, under the persecutions of Empson and Dudley, in the reign of her grandfather. Scarce any body was fase from them: but they fell with the greatest violence upon the worthiest persons, producing fines, imprison∣ments, exiles, and confiscation of estares. In short, every dreary year of her inglorious reign was blackened
<PB N="261" REF="280"/>with remarkable disasters, and by such acts of injustice' rapine, violence, oppression, and tyranny, as Spanish councils only could have suggested.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> JOHN ROGERS.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN ROGERS was an Englishman by birth, and educated at the university of Cambridge, where he be∣nefited very much in learning, and from thence was chosen by the merchant-adventurers to be their Chap∣lain at Antwerp, to whom he preached many years, and there falling into acquaintance with William <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indal and Miles Coverdale (who were sled thither from the persecution in England) he, by their means, profited much in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and joined with them in that painful and prositable work of trans∣lating the Bible into English, and being much enlight∣ened thereby, he cast off the yoke of Popery, judging it to be impure and idolatrous. Having married a wife at Antwerp, he removed from thence to Witten∣berg, where he advanced much in study, and grew so skilful in the Dutch tongue, that he was chosen pastor to a congregation, and discharged his office with diligence and faithfulness for many years.</P>
<P>In the reign of King Edward, he was sent for home by Bishop Ridley, and made a Prebendary of St. Paul's; and the Dean and chapter chose him to read a divinity∣lecture in that church: In which place he continued till Queen Mary's days. In the beginning of her reign, in a sermon at St. Paul's cross, he exhorted the people to adhere constantly to that doctrine which they had been taught, and to beware of Popery, Idolatry, and Superstition; for which he was called before the Lords of the council, where he made an ingenuous and godly answer, but withal carried himself so prudently, that for that time he was dismissed. But after the Queen's proclamation came forth, he was ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in called, and committed prisoner to his own house, whence he
<PB N="262" REF="281"/>might have escaped, and had many motives, as a wife and ten children, and friends in Germany where he could not want preferment. But being once called to answer in Christ's cause, he said, he would not depart, though to the hazard of his life. From his own house Bonner removed him to Newgate, where he remained some time, among thieves and murderers.</P>
<P>At last he was again called before the Lords of the council, where Gardiner the Lord Chancellor taunted, reviled, and checked him not suffering him to speak his mind, and remanded him to prison; whereupon he wrote thus: "I was compelled to leave off what I would have gladly spoken, and therefore I desire the most hearty and unseigned prayers of all Christ's true members, the true imps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Imp signifies, in this case, son, offspring, or progeny.</NOTE> of the true Catholic church: that the Lord God of all consolation will now be my comfort, strength buckler, and shield: as also of all my brethren who are in the same case; that I, and you all, may despise all manner of threats, and cruelty, and even the bitter burning fire, and the dreadful dart of death, and stick like true soldiers to our dear and loving captain Christ Jesus, our only Redeemer and Saviour, and the only true head of the church: that we do not traiterously run out of his tents, or rather out of the plain field from him in the heat of the bat∣tle: but that we may persevere in the fight (if he please not otherwise to deliver us) till we be most cruelly slain by his enemies. For this I most heartily, and even with tears, most instantly and earnestly desire you all to pray: and if I die, to be good to my poor and most honest wife, being a poor stranger, and to all my little souls, her and my children."</P>
<P>The day following he was brought before the coun∣cil again, and also a third time, where he met with the like usage; and, when by no means they could re∣move him from his constancy, Gardiner read his sen∣tence of condemnation, degraded him, and then de∣livered him over to the secular power: declaring that
<PB N="263" REF="282"/>he was under the great curse, and that it was a dange∣rous and vengeable matter to eat or drink with him, or to give him any thing; for that all who did so should partake of the same curse. Then Mr. Rogers said: "Well, my Lord, here I stand before God and you, and all this honourable audience, and take him to witness, that I never wittingly and willingly taught any false doctrine; and therefore have I a good con∣science before God and all good men. I am sure that you and I shall come before a righteous Judge, before whom I shall be as good a man as you: and I nothing doubt, but I shall be found a true member of Jesus Christ, and everlastingly saved: and as for your false church, you needed not to have excommunicated me out of it, for I have not lived in it these twenty years, the Lord be thanked for it." He then desired that his wife might be admitted to come to him whilst he lived: but Gardiner would by no means grant his request.</P>
<P>On February 4, 1555, he was wakened (being then sound asleep) by the Keeper of Newgate's wife, and told to prepare himself for the fire. Being desired to make haste, he said, "If it be so, I need not tie my points<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By that he meant the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tchets of his shoes.</NOTE>;" and was immediately hurried away to Bon∣ner, of whom he earnestly requested to speak with his wife, but could not prevail. From thence he was carried into Smithfield, where, scarce being permitted to speak to the people, he briefly persuaded them to persevere in the truth which he had taught them, and which he was now ready to seal with his blood. A pardon being offered him, if he would recant, he ut∣terly refused it. His wife, with nine small children, and the tenth sucking at her breast, came to him; but this sorrowful sight had no effect on him, but in the flames he washed his hands, and with an admirable pa∣tience took his death, all the people exceedingly re∣joicing at his constancy, and praising God for it. He was the <HI>Proto-Martyr</HI> in Queen Mary's days.</P>
<PB N="264" REF="283"/>
<P>During the time of his imprisonment, strict search was made in his chamber for his writings and papers, yet none were found: but, after his death, his wife and one of his sons found, lying in a corner under a blind pair of stairs, a book which contained a narra∣tion of his examination, and answers, whereunto were added these as predictions: "If God look not mercifully upon England, the seeds of utter destruction are sown in it already by these hypocritical tyrants, and Anti∣christian Prelates, double traitors to their native coun∣try. And yet they speak of mercy, of blessing, of unity, of the Catholic church, &amp;c. but this double dissimulation will be discovered one day when the plague comes, which undoubtedly will fall upon those crown∣shorn Captains, and that shortly, whatsoever the godly and the poor realm suffer in the mean time by God's permission. For the dispersed English flock shall be brought again into their former state, or a better (I trust in God) than it was in the innocent King Ed∣ward's days; and our bloody Babylonian Bishops, with their whole crown-shorn company, shall be brought to utter shame, rebuke, ruin, and destruction. For God cannot, and undoubtedly will not, suffer for ever their abominable lying, false doctrine, hypocrisy, blood th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ness, whoredoms, idleness, their pestilent lives, pampe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in all kinds of delights, their tonso∣nical boasting pride, their malicious, envious, and poisonful stomachs, which they bear towards his poor afflicted flock. Some shall have their punishment in this world, and they that escape here, shall not escape everlasting damnation. This shall be your sauce, O ye wicked Papists, make ye merry as long as ye may."</P>
<P>Whilst he lay in the prison of Newgate, he was very merry, and earnest in all he went about, being there above a year. To the prisoners he was very charitable, and liberal; for their sakes he made an agreement with his fellows, that they should eat but one meal a day,
<PB N="265" REF="284"/>yet paying for two, which overplus should be given to them that lacked on the other side of the prison.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> LAURENCE SAUNDERS.</HEAD>
<P>LAURENCE SAUNDERS was born of worshipful pa∣rents, educated at Eaton school, and from thence chosen to King's college in Cambridge, where he re∣mained three years, and greatly profited in learning. Then his mother (who was very rich) thought proper to bind him apprentice to a merchant in London, Sir William Chester.</P>
<P>His master, being a good man, observing that his mind was better fitted for spiritual contemplation than the bustle of a busy life, and that his inclinations were wholly bent on the one, but averse to the other, ac∣quainted his friends with it, gave him back his inden∣tures, and released him from his engagement.</P>
<P>Saunders being ravished with the love of learning, especially with reading the scriptures, soon after re∣turned to Cambridge, where he studied Greek and Hebrew, but chiefly divinity, that he might qualify himself for a ministerial life. He was frequent, and very fervent in prayer, and, when assaulted by tempta∣tions, had always resource to that exercise, from which he derived much support and consolation. He com∣menced Master of Arts, and continued long in the university. In the beginning of King Edward's reign he began to preach (being first ordained) and by his doctrine and exemplary life did a great deal of service, and gained a general approbation, so far that he was chosen to read a divinity-lecture at Fotheringhay. Soon after he married, and removed from thence to the ministry of Litchfield, where he gained, by his behaviour, even the good opinion of his adversaries. From thence he was removed to Church Langton in Leicestershire, where he taught diligently, and kept a bountiful house, and from thence to All-hallows in
<PB N="266" REF="285"/>Bread street, London. But upon Mary's accession to the crown, he wanted to resign his benefice in town, and took a journey into the country, and in his way preach∣ed at N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tthampton, not meddling with state-affairs, but boldly delivering his opinions against the Popish tenets; which (said he) are likely to be renewed, as a just punishment for the little love which England hath born to the true word of God, so plentifully offered to them. Some of the Queen's men, which were there, and heard him, were highly displeased with his sermon, and on that account confined him some time among them. But, in regard to his friends, who were great sticklers for Mary, and because there was no law broken by his preaching, at length they dis∣missed him. Not dismayed at this, but inflamed with a godly zeal, he persisted in preaching faithfully at both his benefices, not having opportunity to resign either of them, but into the hands of Papists: and notwithstanding the Queen's proclamation to the con∣trary, he diligently taught his opinions, at his country place, where he then resided, confirming the people, and arming them against the Popish doctrine, till he was commanded and obliged to desist. His friends advised him to quit the kingdom, which he refused; and being hindered there from preaching, he travelled towards London, to visit his flock there.</P>
<P>Sir John Mordaunt, one of the Queen's council, meeting him near London, and inquiring whither he went? <HI>I have</HI> (said Mr. Saunders) <HI>a pastoral charge in London, whither I am going to instruct my people according to the truth.</HI> Mordaunt advised him against it: but Saunders asked him, <HI>How then shall I be discharged be∣fore God; if any be sick, and desire consolation; or if any want good counsel, and instruction, or if any should slip into error, and receive false doctrine?</HI> Being asked if he did not preach at such a time in Bread-street, he re∣plied in the affirmative. Do you intend to preach so again, said Mordaunt? <HI>Yes,</HI> replied Saunders, <HI>to mor∣row
<PB N="267" REF="286"/>you may hear me there, where I will confirm by God's word all that I then preached.</HI> Finding he could not prevail on him to desist from his purpose, Mordaunt left him, and going soon after to Bonner, informed him of Saunders's intention to preach the next day; which he accordingly did; and afterwards, at his lodging, being somewhat troubled in his thoughts, a friend of his asked him how he did? <HI>Truly,</HI> said he, <HI>I am in prison, till I be in prison.</HI></P>
<P>The text which he preached upon in the forenoon was 2 Cor. ii. 2. <HI>I am jealous over you with godly jea∣lousy, for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his sub∣tility, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicicy that is in Christ.</HI> In the afternoon, he was preparing himself to preach again, when an officer from Bonner came and took him before that prelate, with whom he found Mordaunt. He was charged with treason for acting contrary to the Queen's proclamation; and with heresy and sedition for his sermon. Bonner said he would prove him to be a heretic, because he taught that the administration of the sacraments, and all orders of the church, were most pure which came nearest to the order of the primitive church: for (said Bonner) the church was then in her infancy, and could not bear that perfection which afterwards it ac∣quired by ceremonies. Saunders answered from St. Augustine, "that ceremonies were given to the infirm and weak, and therefore it was a sign of the great perfection of the primitive church, that it had few ceremonies; whereas the Roman church had many, and these partly blasphemous, unsavory, and unpro∣fitable." After some other discourse, the Bishop de∣sired him to write his judgment concerning transub∣stantiation, which he did, saving, <HI>You seek my blood, and you shall have it: I pray God you may be so baptised in it, that you may hereafter loath blood-sucking, and be∣come
<PB N="268" REF="287"/>a better man.</HI> He was then sent to Gardiner, who demanded of him how he had dared to preach, notwithstanding the Queen's proclamation? Saunders replied, that he did but, according to his duty, ex∣hort his flock to persevere and stand stedfast in the doctrine they had been taught: repeating the words of the Apostle, <HI>that it is better to obey God than man,</HI> and said, that what he did, he was moved thereto by his own conscience. A goodly conscience indeed, said Gardiner; this your conscience could make the Queen a bastard; would it not? No, replied Saun∣ders, we declare no such matter; but for that let them care whose writings are yet abroad to testify the same, not without the shame and reproach of the author. This he said, alluding to a book Gardiner had published, to curry favour with Henry VIII. wherein he had openly declared Queen Mary to be a bastard. No, said he, we only profess, and teach, the sincerity and purity of God's word; which, albeit it be now forbidden us to publish with our mouths, yet I doubt not but it will be sealed with our blood.</P>
<P>Gardiner, irritated at the freedom of his speech, ordered him to prison; on which Saunders said, <HI>I thank God for having at last given me a place of rest, where I may pray for your conversion.</HI> He continued in prison one year and three months: and was so zealous in defence of the truth, that he forbade his wife to sue for his delivery: and, when other of his friends had by suit almost obtained it, he so discoura∣ged them that they gave over the pursuit. Being brought again to examination, and life promised him, if he would recant, he answered, <HI>I love my life and liberty, if I could enjoy them without the hurt of my own conscience; but, by God's grace, I will bear the utmost that man can do against me, rather than do any thing against my own conscience:</HI> And, when Gardiner threatened him with death, he said, <HI>Welcome be it, whatsoever the will of the Lord be, either life or death; and I tell you
<PB N="269" REF="288"/>truly, I have learnt to die: but I exhort you to beware of shedding innocent blood: truly it will cry aloud against you.</HI></P>
<P>Being excommunicated, degraded, and condemned, he was sent to Coventry to be burned. When he came near the place of execution, on February 8, 1555, he went chearfully to the stake, kissing it, and saying, <HI>Welcome, the cross of Christ! Welcome, everlasting life!</HI> The fire was made of green wood and other smothering materials which would not burn, whereby he underwent grievous torments: but the grace, and plentiful consolation of Christ, which never forsake his servants, gave him admirable strength and patience, so that he died with great calmness and resignation.</P>
<P>During his imprisonment, he wrote many excellent letters; and after his condemnation, in a letter to his wife, and friends, he thus writes; "Oh what worthy thanks can be given to our gracious God, for his un∣measurable mercies plentifully poured upon us! And I, most unworthy wretch, cannot but bewail my great ingratitude, towards so gracious a God and loving father. I beseech you all, as for my other many sins, so especially for my sin of unthankfulness, crave par∣don for me in your earnest prayers. To number God's mercies in particular, were to number the drops of water in the sea, the sands on the shore, or the stars in the heavens. O my dear wife and friends, rejoice with me, I say rejoice with thanksgiving, for this my promotion, in that I am made worthy to magnify my God, not only in my life, by my slow mouth, and un∣circumcised lips, bearing witness of his truth, but also by my blood to seal the same, to the glory of my God, and confirming of his true church. I profess to you, that, as yet, the comfort of my sweet Christ doth drive from me the fear of death; but if my dear husband Christ do, for my trial, leave me a little to myself, alas I know in what case I shall then be: but if he do, yet I know that he will not be long, nor far absent from me; though he stand behind the wall, yet he will peep
<PB N="270" REF="289"/>in at a crevice. He is a tender-hearted Joseph, tho' he speak roughly to his brethren, and threatened bond∣age to his best beloved Benjamin, yet can he not con∣tain himself from weeping upon us, and with us, from falling on our necks, and sweetly kissing us. Such, such a brother is our Christ unto all his; wherefore hasten to go unto him, as Jacob did with his sons and family, leaving their country and acquaintance. Yea this our Joseph hath obtained for us, that Pharoah the infidel shall provide us chariots, whereby with ease we may be carried to him. Our very adversaries do help us to our everlasting bliss, by their speedy dispatch, blessed be our God. Fear not bugbears which lie in the way; fear rather the everlasting fire, &amp;c. My dear wife, and fellow heirs of the everlasting kingdom, always remember the Lord; rejoice in hope, be pa∣tient in tribulation, continue instant in prayer, and pray for us appointed for the slaughter, that we may be unto our heavenly Father a fat offering, and an ac∣ceptable sacrifice. Farewel, all in Christ, in hope to be joined with you in everlasting joy. Amen, Amen, Amen. Pray, Pray."</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> Dr. JOHN HOOPER.</HEAD>
<P>This divine was born in Somersetshire, A. D. 1495, and in 1514 sent to Merton college in Oxford, where he was placed under the tuition of his uncle John Hooper, master fellow of that college, and principal of St. Alban's-hall. In 1518, John the nephew was admitted bachelor of arts, which was the highest degree he took in that university, and about the same time compleated it by determination. After this he is said to have been one of the Carmelites or White-friers, and to have continued so for some years, till growing weary of a monastic life, he re∣turned to Oxford; but having there embraced the
<PB N="271" REF="290"/>Protestant principles, when the act of the six articles came out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 11 of this volume.</NOTE>, he was compelled to quit the university. He then went to live in Devonshire with Sir Thomas Arun∣del, as his chaplain and steward: till Sir Thomas having intelligence of his opinions, which were contrary to his own, yet having a great regard for his integrity, sent him on a message to Gardiner Bishop of Winchester, writing privately to the prelate to endeavour to reclaim him, but in any case requiring him to send him his servant again.</P>
<P>Gardiner conferred with him several days; but finding him fixed in his opinions, sent him back, according to Sir Thomas's desire, much commending his wit and learning, but ever after bore a secret grudge and antipathy against him: so that, soon after, Mr. Hooper was warned by some private friends to provide for his own safety, for that there was something secretly forming against him. Upon this he lest the kingdom, and went to Paris. After some time, he re∣turned, and lived with a gentleman of the name of Sentlow: but understanding that snares were again laid for him, with much difficulty and danger he escaped a second time abroad, and travelled into Germany, where he became acquainted with many learned men, and by them was generously entertained, both at Bazil and Zurich; especially by Bullinger, who became his very intimate friend.</P>
<P>There he studied Hebrew, and married a wife; and at last, upon Edward VI.'s accession to the crown, he, with many other exiles, returned to London, where he generally preached twice, and at least once every day. The people so flocked to hear him, that the churches could not contain them. He was soon ap∣pointed chaplain to the Duke of Somerset. In his doctrine and ministry he was earnest and zealous, elo∣quent

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="271" REF="292"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="272" REF="293"/>in his discourse, and perfect and ready in the scriptures. In his labour, and pains-taking, he con∣tinued indefatigable to the end of his life: neither did promotion change him, nor dainty fare corrupt him. He was of a strong body, sound health, pregnant wit, and of invincible patience; spare of diet, spare of words, and sparest of time: a liberal housekeeper, and very grave in his deportment. Being at length called to preach before King Edward, he was created Bishop of Gloucester<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of his scruples about the episcopal habits, page 130 of this volume.</NOTE>, where he remained two years, and then of Worcester; where he behaved so uprightly and inoffensively, that his enemies had nothing to say against him. He used to go about among the diffe∣rent towns and villages of his diocese to preach to the people: and he so governed his own house, that there was nothing to be found in it, but good exam∣ple, honest conversation, and reading of the scriptures. In his hall, he kept daily a table spread with good store of victuals, for the poor people of the city of Wor∣cester, by turns: and, when they were served (being before examined by himself or his deputies, of the Lord's Prayer, Creed, and ten commandments) then he himself sat down to dinner, and not before.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of Queen Mary, he was sent for, by a pursuivant, to London; and though he had opportunity, and was persuaded by his friends to fly, he refused, saying, <HI>Once I did fly; but now being called to this place, and vocation, I am resolved to stay, and to live and die with my sheep.</HI></P>
<P>When he came to London in August, Gardiner committed him, on September 1, to prison, with some bitter reproaches; afterwards also, at his examination, they called him beast, hypocrite, &amp;c. which he bore with great patience. In the Fleet, where he was con∣fined, he had nothing but a pad of straw for a bed, and a rotten covering, till some people sent him a bed
<PB N="273" REF="294"/>to lie on. Concerning his base usage in prison, he himself thus writes: <HI>I paid always to the warden of the Fleet as a Baron paid, as well in fees, as for my board,</HI> viz <HI>twenty shillings per week, till I was wrongfully de∣prived of my bishopric, and after that time I paid as the best gentleman in the house; yet he always used me worse, and more vilely than a very slave. Thus I suffered im∣prisonment almost eighteen months, my goods, living, friends, and comfort, being taken from me: the Queen owing me above eighty pounds, yet hath she cast me in prison, and allows me nothing; neither are any suffered to come at me, whereby I may be relieved. I am under a wicked man, and woman, and see no remedy but in God's help: but I commit my just cause to him, whose will be done, whether it be by life or death.</HI></P>
<P>When he was brought to examination before Gardi∣ner, and the other commissioners, on January 21, 1555, there was such a noise and tumult whenever he began to speak, that he was forced to be silent; nevertheless they proceeded to degrade and condemn him, and then delivered him over to the secular power. As they were carrying him to Newgate, one of the Sheriffs asked him why he was so hasty and quick with the Lord Chancellor, and used no more patience to him? To which he answered, "Mr. Sheriff, I was nothing at all impatient, though I was earnest in my Master's cause: and it stands me in hand so to be; for it goeth upon life and death, not in this world only, but in the world to come." After his degradation, he lay six days a close prisoner in Newgate, none of his friends being suffered to come to him: during which time Bonner, Harpsfield, and several others came to him, using various means to bring him to recant: but they found him stedfast and immoveable. On February 4, his keeper gave him some hints, that he should be sent to Gloucester to be burnt, which he rejoiced at exceed∣ingly, lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, and praising God that he should be sent amongst the people

<PB N="274" REF="297"/>over whom he had been pastor, to confirm with his blood the truth of what he had formerly taught them, not doubting but the Almighty God would enable him to perform it to his glory. And immediately he sent for his boots, spurs, and cloak, that he might be ready to ride when they should call for him. The day following, he was delivered to some of the Queen's guard, who conveyed him to Gloucester on the 7th. When he came near the city, he was met by numbers of the people, who lamented his situation. Next day Sir Anthony Kingston, coming to him, told him, that life was sweet, and death bitter. To which he answered, "the death to come is more bitter, and the life to come more sweet. I am come hither to end this life, and suffer death, because I will not gain∣say the truth I have formerly taught you here."</P>
<P>Being delivered to the Sheriff on February 9, being market-day, he said to him, My request to you, Mr. Sheriff, is, only that there may be a quick fire, soon to make an end of me, and in the mean time I will be as obedient to you as you can desire: if you think I do amiss in any thing, hold up your finger, and I have done. I might have had my life, with much worldly gain, but I am willing to offer up my life for the truth, and trust to die a faithful servant to God, and a true subject to the Queen. When he saw the Sheriffs men with so many weapons, he said, "This is more than needs; if you had willed me, I would have gone to the stake, and have troubled none of you all." As he went to the place appointed for his exe∣tion (which was opposite to the college of priests, where he used to preach) he was forbid to preach to the people. His looks were chearful, and his coun∣tenance more ruddy than usual<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was drest in a gown of his landlord's; had a hat on his head, and a staff in his hand, to support him, as the sciatica, which he had contracted in prison, made him halt.</NOTE>. Being come to the
<PB N="275" REF="298"/>stake, he prayed about half an hour, whereof the following is a part; "Lord, I am hell, but thou art heaven: I am a sink of sin, but thou art a gracious and a merciful Redeemer. Have mercy, therefore, upon me a most miserable and wretched offender, after thy great mercy, and according to thine inestimable goodness. Thou art ascended into heaven, receive me to partake of thy joys, where thou fittest in equal glory with thy Father. For well knowest thou, Lord, wherefore I am come hither to suffer, and why the wicked do persecute thy poor servant: not for my sins and transgressions committed against thee, but because I will not allow of their wicked doings, to the contaminating of thy blood, and to the denial of the knowledge of thy truth, wherewith it did please thee by thy Holy Spirit to instruct me. With as much di∣ligence as a poor wretch might (being thereto called) I have set forth thy glory. Thou well seest, O Lord my God, what terrible torments, and cruel pains, are prepared for thy poor creature: even such, Lord, as, without thy strength, none is able to bear or patiently to pass; but that which is impossible with man is possible with thee. Therefore strengthen me of thy goodness, that in the fire I break not the rules of pa∣tience, or else asswage the terror of the pains; as shall seem fittest to thy glory."</P>
<P>When he was in the midst of his prayer, a box with a pardon being set before him, he cried, "If you love my soul, away with it; if you love my soul, away with it;" and then proceeded in his devotion. When his prayer was done, he prepared himself for the stake, and was undrest to his shirt, which he trussed between his legs, where he had a bag of gunpowder, and another under each arm. Three iron hoops being prepared to fasten him to the stake, he only put one of them round his middle, bidding them take away the rest, saying, I doubt not but God will give me strength to bide the extremity of the fire without
<PB N="276" REF="299"/>binding. When reeds were cast to him, he embraced and kissed them, putting them under his arms. When fire was first put to him, the faggots being green, and the wind blowing away the flame, he was but scorch∣ed: more faggots being laid to him, the fire was so suppressed, that his nether parts were burned, his up∣per being scarce touched. He prayed mildly, as one that felt no pain, "O Jesus, the son of David, have mercy upon me, and receive my soul:" and, wiping his eyes with his hands, he said, "For God's love, let me have more fire." A third fire being kindled, it burned more violently, yet he was alive in it a great while; the last words he uttered being, "Lord Jesus have mercy on me, Lord Jesus receive my spirit:" and then gave up the ghost.</P>
<P>He was above three quarters of an hour in the fire before he died; yet he patiently suffered the extremity thereof, neither moving forwards, backwards, or to any side: and having his nether parts burned, and his bowels fallen out, he quietly expired<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bishop Ridley's letter to him, in note, page 215 of this volume.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of Dr.</HI> ROWLAND TAYLOR.</HEAD>
<P>ROWLAND TAYLOR was Doctor of both laws, and parson of Hadley in Suffolk, where Thomas Bilney had formerly been a preacher<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See note, page 421 of vol ii. of this work.</NOTE>, and in which place there were few, either men or women, that were not well learned in the holy scriptures, many having read over the whole Bible, and could say a deal of St. Paul's Epistles by heart. There Dr. Taylor preached constantly on Sundays, holydays, and other times when he could get the people together. So soon as he was called to this place, he left the family of Dr. Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he had former∣ly
<PB N="277" REF="300"/>lived, and, like a good shepherd, constantly abode with his flock, and gave himself wholly to the study of the sacred writings, most faithfully endeavouring to fulfil the precept of Christ to Peter, <HI>Lovest thou me? Feed my sheep</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John xxi.</NOTE> His life and conversation were very examplary, and full of holiness: he was meek and humble, yet would stoutly rebuke sin in those of the highest rank: very mild, void of all rancour and malice, ready to do good to all men, forgiving his enemies, and far from doing wrong to any. He was a father to the poor and distressed, causing the parishioners to make good provision for them, besides what he gave them out of his own bounty. He brought up his own children in the fear of God and in good learning: and continued all the days of King Edward in this holy and exemplary exercise.</P>
<P>In the beginning of Mary's reign, a priest was pro∣cured, by some of the Popish party, to come and say mass in his church. Being at his study, and hearing the bell toll, he went to the church, and finding the priest guarded with drawn swords, in his robes, ready to begin the mass, he said to him, "Thou Devil, who made thee so bold to enter into this church, to pro∣fane and defile it with this abominable idolatry? I command thee, thou Popish wolf, in the name of God, to avoid hence, and not to presume thus to poi∣son Christ's flock."—Then said one Foster, the ring∣leader in this business, to Taylor, "Thou traitor, what dost thou here, to let and disturb the Queen's proceedings?" Dr. Taylor answered, "I am no trai∣tor, but the shepherd which God, and my Lord Christ, hath appointed to feed this flock; and therefore I have good authority to be here." After some more alter∣cations, Foster, and his armed men, forced the Doctor out of the church, and the priest went on with the mass. Soon after, Foster wrote a complaint against
<PB N="278" REF="301"/>him to Gardiner, who sent his letters-missive for him; whereupon his friends earnestly entreated him to fly, telling him, that he could neither expect justice, nor favour, but imprisonment, and cruel death: but he answered, "I know my cause to be so good and righte∣ous, and the truth so strong upon my side, that I will, by God's grace, appear before them, and to their beards resist their false doings; for I believe, that I shall never be able to do God so good service as now, and that I shall never have so glorious a calling, nor so great mercy of God profered me as I have now: therefore pray for me, and I doubt not but God will give me strength, and his holy spirit, that all my ad∣versaries shall be ashamed of their doings." His friends represented to him, that he had sufficiently done his duty, and been witness to the truth, both in his ser∣mons, and resisting the Popish priest, and advised him to reserve himself for better times; but he answered, "I am now old, and have already lived too long to see these terrible and wicked days. You may do as your consciences serve you, but I am resolved not to fly: God will hereafter raise up teachers, which shall with much more diligence and fruit teach than I have done; for God will not forsake his church, though for a time he trieth and correcteth us, and that not without just cause."</P>
<P>His friends, seeing his constancy and resolution, with tears recommended him to God; and so preparing himself he went to London, and presented himself be∣fore Gardiner the Lord Chancellor, who reviled him, calling him knave, traitor, heretic, asking him if he knew who he was? To which Taylor replied, "Yea, I know you, and all your greatness; yet you are but a mortal man: and if I should be afraid of your lordly looks, why fear you not God the Lord of us all? How dare you for shame look any Christian in the face, see∣ing you have forsaken the truth, denied our Saviour Christ and his word, and done contrary to your own
<PB N="279" REF="302"/>oath and writing? With what countenance can you ap∣pear before the judgment-seat of Christ, and answer for your oath, first made to Henry VIII. and afterwards to Edward VI.?" Gardiner told him, that was Herod's oath, unlawful, and therefore fit to be broke; and thank∣ed God that he had broke it, and returned to the church of Rome, which he advised Taylor also to do. Tay∣lor said, "Should I forsake the church of Christ, which is founded upon the true foundation of the Pro∣phets and Apostles, to approve those lies, errors, su∣perstitions, and idolatries, that are approved of most blasphemously by you? God forbid. Remember that you wrote truly against the Pope, and were sworn a∣gainst him." Upon which Gardiner abused him with reviling language, calling him an arrogant knave, and a very fool. Taylor desired him to leave his railing, said it was unseemly in one of his station, and bid him remember, that he that calls his brother sool is in danger of hell fire. On Gardiner's upbraiding him for being a married man, Taylor said, "Yea, and I thank God that I am, and have had nine children, all in lawful matrimony; and blessed be God that ordained matrimony, and commanded, that all that had not the gift of continency should marry, and not live in whoredom and adultery." After some other discourse, the Bishop committed him to the King's Bench prison, where he lay almost two years.</P>
<P>In prison he spent his time in prayer, reading the scriptures, preaching to the prisoners, and to others that resorted to him: and it pleased God, that he found in that prison Mr. Bradford, whom he exhorted to faith; strength, and patience, and to persevere con∣stantly unto the end. Bradford thanked God who had provided him so comfortable a fellow prisoner, and they both together praised God, and continued in prayer, reading, and exhorting one another; insomuch as Dr. Taylor told his friends, that God had provided graci∣ously for him, to send him to that prison, where he
<PB N="280" REF="303"/>found such an angel of God, to be in his company to comfort him. He was several times examined concern∣ing his faith, and at last was condemned to die. When the sentence was read, he told them, that God, the righteous judge, would require his blood at their hands, and that the proudest of them all should re∣pent their receiving of Antichrist again, and their per∣secution of the flock of Christ. He also thus wrote to his friends, "God be praised, since my condemnation, I was never afraid to die. God's will be done. If I shrink from God's truth, I am sure of another manner of death than had Judge Hales<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 193 of this volume.</NOTE>. But God be praised, even from the bottom of my heart, I am unmoveably settled upon the rock, nothing doubting but that my dear God will perform and finish the work that he has begun in me and others. To him be all honour, both now and ever, through Christ our only Saviour. Amen."</P>
<P>After his condemnation, Bonner came to the prison to degrade him, bringing all the garments used by the priests in officiating at mass, which Taylor refused to put on, till it was done forcibly; when Dr. Taylor, setting his hands by his sides, walked up and down, and said, "How say you now, my Lord, am I not a goodly fool? If I were in Cheapside, would not all the boys laugh at these apish toys?" The Bishop, having despoiled him of all, would have given him a stroke on his breast with his crosier: But his chaplain said, My Lord, strike him not, for he will surely strike again. "Yea, by St. Peter, will I, said Taylor; the cause is Christ's, and I were no good Christian, If I would not fight in my master's quarrel." Then the Bishop cursed him, but durst not strike him: to whom Dr. Taylor answered, "Though you curse, yet God doth bless me." Next night his wife, son, and servant, came to him, where before supper they kneeled down and pray∣ed,
<PB N="281" REF="304"/>saying the Litany. Being sent down to Hadley to be burned, he was very chearful all the journey, as one going to a banquet or bridal. On the way, the Sheriff of Essex much persuaded him to return to the Popish religion; to whom he at last said, "I well per∣ceive now that I have been deceived myself, and shall deceive many in Hadley of their expectation." When the Sheriff desired him to explain his meaning, hoping that he would recant, he said, "I am a man of a very great carcass, which I hoped should have been buried in Hadley church-yard; but I see I am deceived: and there are a great number of worms there, which should have had jolly feeding on this carrion, but now both I and they shall be deceived of our expectation." When he came within two miles of Hadley, he desired to alight; and being down, he leapt, and gave a frisk or two, saying, "God be praised, I am now almost at home, and have not above two stiles to go over, and I am even at my Father's house." At Hadley town's end, a poor man, with five children, met him, crying, "O dear father and good shepherd, God help and succour thee, as thou hast many a time succoured me, and my poor children." The streets were filled with people, weeping, and lamenting their loss of such an excellent preacher: To whom he said, "I have preach∣ed to you God's word and truth, and am now come to seal it with my blood. He gave all his money to the poor, for whom he was wont to provide formerly. Once a fortnight at least he used to call upon Sir Henry Doile, and other rich clothiers, to go with him to the alms houses, to see what the poor lacked in meat, drink, apparel, and other necessaries; withal exhorting, comforting, and rebuking, as he saw occasion. Com∣ing to the place of execution, on February 9, 1555, he was not suffered to speak to the people, yet he was very chearful, saying, "Thanks be to God, I am even at home:" and when he had prayed, and made ready, he came to the stake and kissed it. He would
<PB N="282" REF="305"/>fain have spoken to the people, but one thrust a tip∣staff into his mouth, another struck him on the head, and another threw a faggot at him, which broke his face, that the blood ran down: to whom Dr. Taylor said, "O friend, I have harm enough, what needed that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 214 of this volume.</NOTE>?" When he was saying the Psalm <HI>Miserere</HI> in English, Sir John Shelton struck him on the lips, say∣ing, "You knave, I will make you speak Latin." The fire being kindled, he held up his hands, calling upon God, and saying, "Merciful Father of Heaven, for Jesus Christ my Saviour's sake, receive my soul into thy hands." and so stood still, without moving, till one, with an halbert, struck out his brains.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> JOHN BRADFORD.</HEAD>
<P>John Bradford was born at Manchester in Lanca∣shire, and by his parents brought up to learning; and afterwards he served Sir John Harrington, a man much employed under Henry VIII. and Edward VI. in which place he had opportunity of greatly advantaging himself; for his master found him so active, and fit for his employments, that above all others he made most use of his faithful service; and he continued with him several years.</P>
<P>But the divine pleasures intending him for better em∣ployment, having given up a just account to his mas∣ter, with his approbation, he went to Cambridge, where, by his diligence in study, he profited so much in knowledge, and so pleased all, by his godly and blameless conversation, that, after one year's abode in the university, he was made Master of Arts, and cho∣sen Fellow of Pembroke-hall. There Bucer falling into acquaintance with him, persuaded him to enter into the ministry, which he modestly excused for want of learning: but Bucer said, "If thou have not
<PB N="283" REF="306"/>fine manchet, yet give the people barley-bread, or such as thou hast." Being thus persuaded to enter into the ministry, Bishop Ridley made him a Prebendary of St. Paul's, where he continued preaching three years faithfully, reproving fin sharply, and pithily impugn∣ing errors and heresies, and persuading to a godly life. In the beginning of Queen Mary's reign, Bourne, Bi∣shop of Bath, made a seditious sermon at St. Paul's cross, which so enraged the populace, that they were ready to pull him out of the pulpit, and one threw a dagger at him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 181 of this volume.</NOTE>; whereupon Bourne requested Brad∣ford (who was behind him) to stand in his place, and to quiet the people, which he accordingly did, and afterwards safely conveyed Bourne to his house; on which one said to him, "Ah, Bradford, Bradford, thou savest him that will help to burn thee." In the afternoon Bradford preached at Bow-church, and sharply reprimanded the people for their carriage: yet within three days after, he was sent for before the coun∣cil, charged with sedition for this act, and committed prisoner to the Tower. From thence they removed him to the King's Bench; and after his condemnation he was sent to the Counter in the Poultry; in which places, during the time that he remained prisoner, he preached twice a-day, unless sickness prevented it, and often administered the sacrament. Preaching, reading, and prayer, were the chief pleasures of his life. He was in such credit with his keeper in the King's Bench, that sometimes in the evening he would give him leave, on his bare word, to go into London to visit a sick friend; and he was so mindful of his promise, that he used to return to prison again, rather before his hour than after. He was of person somewhat tall and slen∣der, spare of body, of a faint sanguine colour, and an auburn beard. He slept little, his recreation was ho∣nest company, and Christian discourse a little after din∣ner
<PB N="284" REF="307"/>and then to his book again. He counted the hour ill spent that was not employed in doing some good, either with his pen, study, or exhorting others. He was no niggard of his purse, but would liberally communicate what he had to his fellow-prisoners. Once a-week he visited the thieves on the other side of the prison, giving them godly exhortations, and dis∣tributing some money among them. An intimate friend of his asked him, if he should procure his liber∣ty, what he would do, and where he would go? To whom he answered, that he cared not whither he were delivered out of prison or no; but if he should, that then he would marry, and abide secretly in England, and teach the people as the time would suffer him. He was had in great esteem and admiration of all good men: so that many who only knew him by report, much lamented his death; and even many of the opposite party wished he might live. Few days passed, wherein he shed not some tears before he went to bed: nor was there any prisoner with him but received some profit by him. He had many opportunities of escaping, but would not embrace them. The night before he was carried to Newgate, he dreamed that chains were brought for him to the Counter, and that the next day he should be carried to Newgate, and the day follow∣ing be certainly burned at Smithfield; which accord∣ingly came to pass: for that day, in the afternoon, the Keeper's wife came running into his chamber, saying, O Mr. Bradford, I bring you heavy news, for to∣morrow you must be burned; your chain is now a buying, and presently you must go to Newgate. At this, Mr. Bradford put off his cap, lifting up his eyes to heaven, and said, "I thank God for it: I have looked for this a long time, it comes not to me suddenly, but as a thing waited for every day and hour: the Lord make me worthy thereof. He spent the rest of the evening in prayers. The morning be∣fore he was burned, as he was putting on a clean shirt,
<PB N="285" REF="308"/>in which he was to suffer, he made such a prayer of the wedding-garment, that every one present were in great admiration. At his departing out of his cham∣ber, he prayed earnestly, and gave money to every servant and officer in the house, exhorting them to fear and serve God, labouring to avoid all manner of evil. Then turning about to the wall, he prayed vehemently, that the words he had spoken in them might not be in vain, but that the Lord would work effectually for Christ's sake. During his imprisonment, he had been oft examined before the Bishops, and profered life, if he would recant: but he answered, "Life with God's displeasure is worse than death; and death in his true favour is true life." When he came into Smithfield (where another young man was to suffer with him) he fell on his face and prayed; then taking a faggot in his hand, he kissed it and the stake also; and pulling off his cloaths, he stood by the stake, and, lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven, said, "O England, England, repent of thy sins, repent of thy sins; be∣ware of idolatry, beware of Antichrists, take heed they do not deceive thee." After that turning his head to the young man, he said, "Be of good comfort, brother, for we shall have a merry supper with the Lord this night." Then embracing the reeds, he said, "Strait is the way, and narrow is the gate, that leadeth to eternal salvation, and few there be that find it;" and then the faggots being kindled, he soon ex∣pired in the flames, A. D. 1555.</P>
<P>He was very charitable, insomuch as in a hard time he sold his chains, rings, and jewels, to relieve those that were in want. In his examination before Gardiner, he often told him that he had sworn six times never to admit the authority of the Bishop of Rome; and therefore, if he examined him as a dele∣gate from him, he durst not answer him, left he should break his oath. Gardiner told him, he pre∣tended stoutly to defend the doctrine of King Edward's
<PB N="284" REF="309"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="285" REF="310"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="286" REF="311"/>days, yet durst not answer him: at which Bradford said, "that all men may know I am not afraid, saving mine oath, ask me what you will, and I will plainly answer, by God's grace, although I see my life lieth thereon. But, O Lord, unto thy hands I commend it, come what will, only sanctify thy name in me, as in an instrument of thy grace. Now ask me what you will." Gardiner asked him, "What think you of the blessed sacrament? Do you not believe Christ's real presence there, in his natural body?" Bradford replied. "My Lord, I do not believe that Christ is corporally present in the sacrament, but that he is pre∣sent there to the faith of the due receiver. As for transubstantiation, I plainly and flatly believe it not." In a letter to his mother and brethren, he thus writes: "I am now in prison, sure enough from starting, and I thank God I am ready with my life and blood to seal those truths which I have preached to you, if God shall account me worthy of that honour; for it is a special benefit of God to suffer for his name, and gos∣pel, as now I do; I heartily thank him for it, and am sure that I shall be partaker of his glory. If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him, as St. Paul says *; therefore be not faint-hearted, but rather rejoice, at least for my sake, who am now in the high way to heaven; for through many afflictions must we enter into that kingdom. Now will God make known who are his: when the wind doth not blow, we cannot discern the wheat from the chaff; but wheat is so far from being hurt by the wind, the wheat re∣mains, but the chaff slieth away, and the wheat is so far from being hurt by the wind, that it is more clean∣sed, and better known to be wheat. Gold when it is cast into the fire is made more precious, so are God's children by the cross of afflictions. God's children are now chastised here, that they may not be con∣demned<NOTE PLACE="foot">2 Timothy ii. 12.</NOTE>
<PB N="287" REF="312"/>with the world: but sure great plagues from God hang over the realm for it. And no marvel if God's hand lies so heavy upon us; for lately, as there was never more knowledge, so never less godly living. It was counted a foolish thing to serve our God truly, and fervent prayer was not passed upon. Preaching was but a pastime, the communion was counted too common, fasting to subdue the flesh was far out of use; alms were almost nothing; malice, covetousness, and uncleanness, were common every where, with swearing, drunkenness, and idleness; and therefore all this evil is come upon us. Yea, I myself loved not this truth, as I should, therefore God thus punisheth me, nay in punishing blesseth me, and I thank him more for this prison, than for any parlour, yea, than for any pleasure I have ever had; for in it I find God, my sweet and good God always."</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> Dr. NICHOLAS RIDLEY.</HEAD>
<P>Nicholas Ridley was born at Willymondswyke in Northumberland, of worshipful parents, and educated in grammatical learning at Newcastle, and from thence sent to Cambridge, where he continued till he was bachelor of arts; he then went to Oxford, and was there elected Fellow of University-college in 1521. After that returning to Cambridge, he was chosen master of Pembroke hall, and made Doctor in divi∣nity. From thence he was called by Archbishop Cranmer to be vicar of Herne in East Kent, where he was a fruitful and painful preacher, at which time he became a favourer of the reformation. After some time, he was made a prebendary of the cathedral church of Canterbury: but not liking his society there, he travelled into France, and studied at Paris and Louvain. At his return he was made chaplain to King Henry VIII. and in 1547 consecrated Bishop of Rochester. He was translated from thence on April 1,
<PB N="288" REF="313"/>1553, the 4th of Edward VI. to the see of London, in the room of the deprived Bishop Bonner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page III of this volume.</NOTE>: and in both his dioceses he took so great pains in preach∣ing, that he was dearly beloved of his flock, to whom also he was singularly exemplary in his life; so that even his enemies had nothing to say against his conduct. Every Sunday and holiday he preached in one place or another, except extraordinary occasions prevented him. He was very well learned, and of such reading that he deserved to be numbered amongst the greatest scholars that these latter ages have produ∣ced; as appeared by his works, sermons, and sundry disputations in both universities. He had a strong me∣mory, a deep wit, was very judicious and very merciful. His person was comely, and well-proportioned in all points. He was free from malice, and soon forgot all injuries done against him; very kind to his kindred, if they behaved well. He used all means to mortify his flesh, being much inclined to prayer and contem∣plation; was sober in discourse, sometimes facetious and merry at meals, after which he used to play at chess about an hour, and then retired to his study, till five o'clock in the evening, when coming down, he, after prayers in his family, went to supper, then played a game at chess, and returned to his study till eleven o'clock. He daily read a lecture at prayer-time to his family, giving every one that could read a New Testament, and hiring them with money to learn chapters by heart, being very careful that his family should set an exam∣ple of godliness and virtue to others. He maintained Nicholas Heath, the deposed Bishop of Worcester<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 146 of this volume.</NOTE>, for a year and an half, in the same splendor, as if the episcopal palace at Fulham had been that Prelate's own: and Bishop Bonner's mother (whom he affectionately called his own mother, though her behaviour merited no friendship from him, he had constantly at meals
<PB N="289" REF="314"/>with him, setting her at the upper end of the table, whoever was present during the time her son was in prison<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 110 and 176 of this volume.</NOTE>. He was first converted by reading a book on the sacrament, written by Bertram in the ninth century, and much confirmed by conferences with Dr. Cranmer and Peter Martyr.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of Queen Mary, he was imprisoned with Cranmer in the Tower<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 173 of this volume.</NOTE>, and from thence sent, with that prelate and Latimer, to Oxford, and there kept in the common goal; till at length, being separated from the others, he was com∣mitted to the custody of one Irish, with whom he continued till the day of his death. Writing to Lati∣mer in prison, he saith, "I pray you, good Father, let me have something more from you to comfort my heart; for except the Lord assist me in his service, I shall play the part but of a white-livered knight; but he can make a coward in his cause fight like a man." In a letter to Mr Bradford, he says, "As far as Lon∣don is from Oxford, yet thence we have received both meat, money and shirts, not only from our acquain∣tance, but from some strangers." And again, he says, "Ever since I heard of our dear brother Rogers his stout confession and departing (blessed be God for it) I never felt any lumpish heaviness in my heart as some∣times I did before. Blessed be God, notwithstanding our hard restraints, and the evil reports raised of us, we are merry in God; and all our care is, and shall be (by God's grace) to please and serve him, from whom we expect, after these temporary and momentary miseries, to have eternal joy and perpetual felicity, with Abra∣ham, Isaac, Jacob, &amp;c. As yet never a learned man, scholar or other, hath visited us, since our coming to Bocardo, which now may be called the college of <HI>Quondams;</HI> for we be no fewer than three, and I dare say every one well contented with his situation, which is
<PB N="290" REF="315"/>our heavenly Father's good and gracious gist. Fare∣wel; we shall, by the grace of God, one day meet and be merry together; which day assuredly ap∣proacheth; the Lord grant it may shortly come."</P>
<P>Writing to Grindal, who was then in exile, he thus informs him of his condition. "I was about two months close prisoner in the Tower, after that (without my seeking) I had the liberty of the Tower granted me, and so I continued about half a year, till, refusing to be present at mass, I was shut up close prisoner again. The last Lent but one, by reason of their rising in Kent, the Tower was so full of prisoners, that my Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Master Latimer, Mr. Bradford, and myself, were all put into one prison, where we remained till almost Easter, and then Dr. Cranmer, Master Latimer, and myself, were sent down to Oxford, and were suffered to have nothing with us, but what we carried upon us. About Whitsuntide following was our disputations at Oxford, after which we had pen, ink, and all things, taken from us, yea, and our own servants were removed from us, and strangers set in their steads, and all of us kept apart, as we are unto this day. God be blessed, we are all three in health, and of good chear, and have looked long ago to have been dispatched; for within a day or two after our disputations we were condemned for heretics: the Lord's will be fulfilled in us, &amp;c."</P>
<P>When he was brought before the Pope's delegate (John White Bishop of Lincoln, and other commis∣sioners) in the divinity-school in Oxford, whilst the commission was reading, he stood bare, till he heard the Cardinal named, and the Pope's holiness, and then he put on his cap; and being admonished by the Bishop to pull it off, he answered, I do not put it on in con∣tempt of your lordship, but that by this my behaviour I may make it appear, that I acknowledge in no re∣spect the usurped supremacy of Rome; and therefore I utterly despise and condemn all authority coming from
<PB N="291" REF="316"/>the Pope. Then the Bishop commanded the beadle to pull off his cap, and Ridley bowing his head, suf∣fered him quietly to do it. After several examina∣tions, he was at last degraded, and condemned to be burnt. The night before he suffered, he caused his beard to be shaven, and his feet washed, and invited his hostess, and the rest at the table, to his wedding. He also asked his brother, whether his sister could find in her heart to be present at it? Yea, said he, I dare say with all her heart. His hostess weeping, he said, "O Mistress Irish, I see now that you love me not, for in that you weep, it appears that you will not be at my marriage, nor are therewith content. I see you are not so much my friend as I thought; but quiet yourself, though my breakfast be somewhat sharp and painful, yet I am sure my supper shall be more sweet and pleasant." His brother offering to watch with him, he refused it, saying, "I intend to go to bed, and sleep as quietly as ever I did in my life." In the morning, he came forth in a fair black gown, faced with foins, and a tippet of velvet, &amp;c. and looking behind him he spied Latimer, coming after him, to whom he said, "O be you there?" "Yea, said Lati∣mer, have after as fast as I can follow." Coming to the stake, he lift up his hands and eyes to heaven, and running to Latimer with a chearful countenance, em∣braced, kissed, and comforted him, saying, "Be of good heart, brother, for God will either asswage the fury of the flame, or give us strength to abide it." He then went to the stake, kneeled by it, kissed it, and prayed earnestly; and being about to speak, his mouth was stopt by some that attended the execution. Being stripped, he stood upon a stone by the stake, and said, "O heavenly Father, I give thee hearty thanks, for that thou hast called me to be a professor of, thee even unto death. I beseech thee, Lord God, have mercy upon this realm of England, and deliver it from all its enemies." As a smith was knocking in
<PB N="292" REF="317"/>the staple, which held the chain, he desired him to knock it in hard, for the flesh would have its course. His brother bringing him a bag of gunpowder, he asked what it was, and being told, said he would re∣ceive it as sent from God; and, when he saw the flame a coming up to him, he cried with a loud voice, "Into thy hands, Lord, I commend my spirit, Lord receive my soul:" but the fire being kept down by the wood, he desired them for Christ's sake to let the sire come to him, which his brother-in-law misunderstand∣ing, still heaped on more faggots, whereby his legs were burned, before his upper parts were touched; at last his upper parts fell into the fire, and he gave up the ghost. Bishop Ridley on a time crossing the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hames, there rose on a sudden such a tempest, that all in the boat were astonished, expecting to be drowned: Rid∣ley desired them not to fear, for the boat carried a Bishop that was to be burned, and not drowned. He suffered in the fifty-fifth year of his age, on Octo∣ber 10, 1555, in the Town-ditch, opposite to Baliol college.</P>
<P>He was a man so revered for his learning and know∣le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge in the sacr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d scriptures, that his very enemies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere forced to acknowledge his excellence: and if his life might have been redeemed with money, Gre∣gory Fiennes, Lord Dacres of the North<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 95, and 96 of this volume.</NOTE>, being his kinsman, would have given ten thousand pounds rather than he should be burned. But so unmerciful and cruel was Queen Mary's temper, that, notwith∣standing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idley's gentlene's to her in the days of King Edward, she would by no means be intreated to spare his life.</P>

Whilst he was Master of Pembroke hall, he used to walk much in the orchard, where he learned by heart almost all St. Paul's epistles, and the epistles of St. James, St. Peter, St. John and St. Jude: concerning which himself said, "Though in time I did forget much of them again, yet the sweet smell thereof I trust I shall carry with me into heaven, and the pro∣fit thereof I have felt all my lifetime hitherto<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For further particulaas of this venerable prelate, see pages 67, 74, 82, 87, 121, 123, 125, 126, 131, 152, 159, 164, 176, 177, 215, 220, and 221, of this volume.</NOTE>."</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> Dr. HUGH LATIMER.</HEAD>
<P>Hugh Latimer was born at Thirkesson, in the county of Leicester, and, being of a ready apt disposition, was, by his parents, brought up to learning, and went to Cambridge at the age of fourteen, where, after other studies, he applied himself to that of school-divinity, and commenced bachelor of divinity, being then a very zealous Papist. He made an oration against Philip Melancthon; railed against Mr. Staf∣ford divinity-lecturer, and desired the scholars in no ways to believe him. He was so zealous in the Popish tenets, and therewith so scrupulous, that, being a priest, he thought he had never sufficiently mixed his
<PB N="294" REF="319"/>massing wine with water, and that he should never be damned, if once he was a professed Friar. He was cross-bearer in the university of Cambridge, and carried it on procession-days, till he was converted by professor Bilney<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note, page 241 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>; who seeing him very violent in his way, though without knowledge, endeavoured to remove his prejudices, and going to the cross-bearer's study, de∣sired him to hear him make a confession of his faith; with which Latimer was so touched, that he gave over school-divinity, and studied more orthodox divines: so that, whereas before he was an enemy to, and almost a persecutor of, the favourers of a reformation, he was now zealous in their cause; changing his old manner of cavilling and railing, into diligent conferring with Bil∣ney or others, and asked Stafford's pardon before he died. He was not satisfied with his own conversion, but became a powerful public preacher; also instruct∣ing many in private: which set many of the Doctors and Friars against him; and Nicholas West, Bishop of Ely; forbade him to preach, A. D. 1529: yet he con∣tinued for three years preaching with much applause; even the Bishop himself admiring his talents.</P>
<P>Soon after, complaint was made against him to Car∣dinal Wolsey; but by the means of Dr. Butts, the King's physician<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 56 of this volume.</NOTE> a favourer of good men, he was chosen into the number of those which laboured in the cause of the King's supremacy. Whereupon he went to court, and lodged with Dr. Butts; but at last being weary of the court, he had, by the Lord Cromwell's means, a living given him in Wiltshire. The place was called West Kingston, near Sarum, where he di∣ligently instructed his flock, and preached zealously many times abroad in the country. Hereupon some Roman Catholic priests drew up articles against him; and he was much molested by William Warham,
<PB N="295" REF="320"/>Archbishop of Canterbury, and John Stokesley Bishop of London, before whom he was cited to appear. They detained him a long time from his own curacy, calling him three times every week before them, which much troubled him: whereupon he wrote to the Archbishop, expostulating with him for so long detaining him from his charge; and that not for any just cause, but only for preaching the truth against abuses which had crept into the church. Yet his application availed nothing, till the King rescued him out of their hands, and, in 1535, at the request of Lord Cromwell, made him Bishop of Worcester<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 427 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>. In that station he conducted himself with great diligence and piety. He spent his whole time in study, teaching, preaching, exhorting, visiting, correcting, and reforming, to the utmost of his power, as far as the times would bear; and though he could not utterly extinguish the reliques of Popery, yet he so managed, that they should be used with as little hurt, and as much profit as might be. Yet there he was not quiet, for one of great place accused him to the King, of preaching sedition, but the King was satisfied with the Prelate's answer. At New-year's tide, it was usual for the Bishops to present the King with a New-year's gift; and Bishop Latimer, among the rest, pre∣sented him with the <HI>New Testament,</HI> wrapped up in a napkin, with this inscription about it, <HI>Fornicatores &amp; adulteros judicabit Dominus;</HI> "Whoremongers and adul∣terers God will judge." But soon after passing of the statute of the six articles, he, seeing that he could not retain his office with a good conscience<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See pages 12 and 13 of this volume.</NOTE>, of his own accord resigned his bishopric; and, when he put off his rochet, in his chamber among his friends, he gave a skip on the floor for joy, feeling his shoulders lighter (as he said) by being discharged from so heavy a bur∣then. After which he betook himself to his former
<PB N="296" REF="321"/>mean parsonage: yet there, by the malice of some priests, who slandered his doctrine, he was much en∣dangered: and though, by Cranmer's means, be for some time escaped their snares, he was at last com∣mitted to the Tower, where he remained till the reign of Edward VI. Being then restored to his liberty, he might also have been restored to his bishopric; but he chose to live in a private way with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rchbishop Cran∣mer; and conceiving that his preaching would be ser∣viceable to religion, he continued a diligent and pain∣ful preacher all that King's reign, in different places, though he was sixty-seven years of age. He rose to his study, winter and summer, at two o'clock in the morn∣ing. He evidently foresaw, and foretold, all those plagues the nation afterwards felt under Queen Mary; and foretold, concerning himself, that his preaching the gospel would cost him his life, and that Stephen Gar∣diner, Bishop of Winchester, who was then in confine∣ment, would be an instrument of persecution.</P>
<P>In the beginning of Queen Mary's reign, he was sent for by a pursuivant, whereof he had notice six hours before he came to his house; yet instead of fly∣ing, he prepared himself for his journey, and, when the pursuivant came, he said, "My friend, you are welcome; I go as willingly to London to give an ac∣count of my faith, as ever I went to any place in the world; and I doubt not, but as God hath formerly made me worthy to preach his word before two excel∣lent Princes, so he will enable me to bear witness to the truth before the third, either to her eternal com∣fort or discomfort." The pursuivant, having deliver∣ed his letter, told him, that he was commanded not to stay for him, and so immediately departed; his ad∣versaries hoping that he would have fled: but Latimer hasted after to London, and, as he rode through Smith∣field, observed that place had long groaned for him. Coming before the council, after many abuses, he was committed to the Tower, where God gave him strength
<PB N="297" REF="322"/>of mind, not only to bear the terribleness of imprison∣ment, but to deride and laugh to scorn the doings of his enemies. This aged father, who may justly be stiled the Demosthenes of the pulpit, being kept in the cold winter without a fire, sent the Lieutenant's ser∣vant to tell his master, that, if he did not look better to him, perchance he might deceive him. The Lieu∣tenant, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nking that he intended to make an escape, charged him with his words; to whom he answered, "You think I shall burn, but, unless you let me have a fire, I shall deceive your expectation, for I am here like to starve with cold." He continued a long time in the Tower, with as much patience as any man could do in such a situation, and from thence was sent to Ox∣ford with Cranmer and Ridley<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See an account of their disputation there, page 220 of this volume.</NOTE>: where they spent their time in fervent prayer and study. Three things Latimer more especially prayed for, 1st, "That as God had appointed him to be a preacher of his word, so that he would give him grace to stand to his doc∣trine, that he might give his heart's blood for the same." 2dly, "That God, of his mercy, would re∣store his gospel to England once again:" which he often inculcated in his prayer, and that with so much ardour, as though he had seen God before him, and spoken to him face to face. 3dly, "That the Lord would preserve the Princess Elizabeth, and make her a comfort to the comfortless realm of England." All which requests God most graciously answered. At last, being condemned, with Ridley, to be burned, when he came to the stake, he list up his eyes with an amiable and comfortable countenance, saying, <HI>Fidelis est Deus,</HI> &amp;c. "God is faithful, who will not suffer us to be tempted above that which we are able to bear." When the fire was brought, he said to Dr. Ridley, "Be of good comfort, brother, and play the man; we shall
<PB N="298" REF="323"/>this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in Eng∣land, as I trust shall never be put out." Being strip∣ped, he seemed a very comely person to all that were present, and whereas, in his cloaths, he appeared a withered, crooked, silly old man, he now stood bolt upright, as comely a father as one might behold. As he was burning, his blood ran out of his heart in such abundance, as if all the blood of his body had been gathered thither, to the great astonishment of the be∣holders, and according to his former request, "that he might be so happy as to shed his heart's blood for the truth." When the fire was first kindled, he cried, "O Father of Heaven, receive my soul:" and so re∣ceiving the flame, and, as it were, embracing it, having stroked his face with his hands, and bathed them a lit∣tle in the fire, he soon expired, with very little seem∣ing pain, on October 16, 1555. In a letter to King Henry VIII. he thus concludes, "Wherefore, graci∣ous King, remember yourself, have pity on your soul, and think that the day is even at hand, when you shall give an account for your office, and of the blood that hath been shed with your sword: In the which day that your grace may stand stedfast and have your <HI>quietus</HI> sealed with the blood of our Saviour Christ, which will only serve at that day, is my daily prayer, &amp;c."</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> PETER MARTYR.</HEAD>
<P>PETER MARTYR was stiled <HI>de Vermiglio</HI> from the place of his nativity, in the territories of Florence, where he was born in 1500, and where his family had flourished for several centuries with reputation. His parents were very solicitous and careful about his edu∣cation; and, being of a pregnant wit, and an ingenious disposition, he gave great hopes, in his minority, of excelling in future times. He was very studious and assiduous, spending no time idle. At sixteen years of
<PB N="299" REF="324"/>age he entered into a monastery of regular canons of St. Augustine, in Fessula, near Florence. There he spent three years in the study of the arts and the holy scriptures, part whereof he learned by heart. Then he went to Padua, where, entering into a monastery of the same order, he continued there al∣most eight years, in which time he almost wholly em∣ployed himself in the study of philosophy. There he heard the daily lectures of famous philosophers, who were professors in that university, as Branda, Genna, Confalionerius, &amp;c. and finding that Aristotle was in many places not properly translated into Latin, he re∣solved to study the Greek language, which accordingly he did, with great labour, as he had not fit masters to assist him therein: by which diligence he acquired such perfection, as to be able to read without help, and un∣derstand the Greek orators, philosophers, and poets. During his abode there, he likewise heard the constant lectures of three divines. When he was twenty-six years old, the fraternity of that monastery called him to the office of preaching, whereby he might put in practice his former private studies, be serviceable to them, and make himself famous; and upon trial his learning and abilities appeared to be such, that he was honoured with the degree of a Doctor. He began first to preach in the church of Brixia, and afterwards in the most famous cities of Italy. All the time he could gain from preaching, he spent in the study of philoso∣phy and divinity. He preached also privately, and read lectures in the colleges of Padua, Ravenna, Bo∣nonia, and Vercellis.</P>
<P>Hitherto he had most applied himself to the study of school-divinity, but now he began to spend most of his time in searching the fountain, the Old and New Tes∣tament; and finding, that, to enable him thereto, the knowledge of the Hebrew was very necessary, whilst he was Vicar to the Prior in Bononia, he applied himself to the study of that language, and, by his singular di∣ligence,
<PB N="300" REF="325"/>became a good proficient therein. His name grew very famous in the chief cities of Italy; and the superiors of his order, approving his diligence, resolved to advance him to some greater dignity, and so by the consent of all he was made Abbot of Spoleta. He behaved so excellently in that station, that he was uni∣versally admired, considering that tho' hitherto he had been only employed in his studies, he yet shewed such wisdom and dexterity in managing the affairs of a monastery.</P>
<P>At Spoleta he continued three years: at the end whereof, by a public convention of the superiors of the order, he was made Governor of the college at Naples, which for the dignity of the place, and pro∣fits belonging to it, was of great esteem. In that city he attained to more light and knowledge of the truth than he formerly had: and by his study of the scrip∣tures observed the errors and abuses that had crept into the church; whereupon he began to read the works of some Protestant authors, by which he owned afterwards that he profited very much. He daily also conferred with some friends that were addicted to the study of the reformed religion, to the mutual edification of both parties. A reformed church being gathered in Naples, Peter Martyr jointed himself to it; and being desirous to instruct others, he began to expound St. Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians with great success; for not only the fellows of his college resorted to him, but many Bishops and Noblemen. But when he came to the words of 1 Cor. iii. 13, 14. <HI>Every man's works shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire,</HI> &amp;c. and had interpreted them contrary to the received opinion, many adversaries were stirred up against him: for it was commonly thought, that these words imply a <HI>purgatory;</HI> but Dr. Martyr shewed, out of the ancient fathers, that these words could not be so understood. However the Popish clergy could by no means endure this interpretation; knowing
<PB N="301" REF="326"/>that if purgatory was overthrown, a great part of their profits by masses, indulgences, &amp;c. would presently cease. Whereupon they accused Martyr, and so far pre∣vailed as to have his lecture put down: but Martyr refused to obey the sentence as unjust, and trusting to the goodness of his cause, appealed to the Pope; and by the assistance of his friends at Rome he overcame his adversaries: for at that time he had there potent friends, as Cardinal Gonzaga, Gaspar Contareni, Re∣ginald Pole, Peter Bembus, and Frederic Fregosius, all learned men, and gracious with the Pope, who also acknowledged that the church needed some re∣formation. By their assistance he got the interdict taken off, and was restored to his former liberty of preaching, which yet he could not long enjoy; for before he had been three years at Naples, he fell into a grievous and dangerous disease, together with his old fellow student Benedictus Cusanus, who died: but Martyr, by the diligence of his physicians, was (tho' with great difficulty) cured. The superiors of his order, in a convention, seeing that the air of Naples did not agree with him, made him general visitor of their order. In that office he so demeaned himself, that good men much commended his integrity, con∣stancy and gravity; and others feared him, not daring to discover their hatred to him. Sometime afterwards, in a co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the superiors, he was made prior of the monastery <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Luc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a Some out of love preferred him to this place; others, thinking that it would prove his rum: for there was an ancient grudge between Florence and Lucca, the latter suspecting that the Florentines wanted to enslave them. But Peter Mar∣tyr, by his excellent learning and virtue, did so prevail on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he people o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lucca, that, contrary to the expec∣tation of his adversaries, himself being a Florentine, he was no less <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>steemed at Lucca, than if he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> amongst them: so that they earnestly desired the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>up riors o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his order, that he might not be removed
<PB N="300" REF="327"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="301" REF="328"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="302" REF="329"/>from thence. Numbers of the nobility, and senators of the city, resorted to his lectures; and, that he might the better plant religion in that commonwealth, he preached to them every Sunday. What fruit his ministry had, may be discerned by this, that in one year's space, after his departure out of Italy, eighteen fellows of that college left their places and po∣pery, betaking themselves to the reformed churches. Many citizens also of Lucca went into voluntary exile, where they might enjoy their opinions with peace and safety. Whilst Martyr remained at Lucca, there met at that city the Emperor Charles V. Pope Paul III. and Cardinal Contareni, coming legate out of Germany; who, for old acquaintance sake, lodged with Martyr, and had daily much conference with him about religion. Most people imagined that Martyr would be in no small danger, on account of the pre∣sence of the Pope; because that his enemies might suggest something to the suspicious old Pontiff, which would turn to Martyr's great trouble. However, as he was strengthened with his own authority and learn∣ing, and a great place in the affections of the people, they moved not at that time; but waited for a fitter opportunity, intending to undermine him secretly. However, as a foretaste of what they intended, they seized upon a friar of Martyr's college, and imprison∣ed him, under the accusation of violating their reli∣gion: but some noblemen rescuing him, thereupon Martyr's enemies accused him at Rome, and in all the colleges of his order, and summoned him to ap∣pear at Geneva, to answer the same; but he, being informed of the snares that were laid for him, and also being admonished by his friends to take care of himself, for that many sought his life, he resolved not to go to the assembly, but to remove himself to some place, where he might be safe from the power and malice of his adversaries. He first conveyed part of his library to Christopher Brent, a senator of Lucca,
<PB N="303" REF="330"/>who, he knew, would take care and send it to Germany to him; the other part of it he gave to the college: and, setting all things in order in that house, he pri∣vately departed out of the city. Purposing to visit his own country, he went to Pisa; and meeting there with some trusty messengers, he wrote to Cardinal Pole, and some other of his friends at Lucca. Being arrived at Florence, he met there with a godly and learned man (Bernardin Ochine) who, being cited to Rome, was going thither; but, being warned of the danger by his friends, he consulted with Martyr, and, upon deliberation, both of them agreed to leave Italy, and retire into Germany.</P>
<P>Ochine departed first, and went to Geneva, and from thence to Augsburgh; and two days after Martyr followed, going first to Bononia, then to Ferrara, and from that to Verona. Being courteously enter∣tained there by his old friends, he went thence over the Alps into Switzerland. In his journey, when he came to Zurich, he was very kindly entertained by Bullinger, Pellicane, and Gualter, and by the other mi∣nisters belonging to that city, to whom he offered his service if they needed it; but it was declined. From thence he went to Basil, where, after he had abode about a month, he was called to Strasburgh, by the means of Martin Bucer; in which place he was made professor of divinity. There he continued five years, in which time he interpreted most part of the Bible, which he had a great skill in. Finding some inconvenience of living single, by the advice of his friends, he married an honest and noble virgin, Catherine Damp Martin, who afterwards died in England without issue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 240 of this volums.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Upon the accession of Edward VI. and the abolishing of the Papacy in England, it was resolved to reform the universities, that a proper ministry should proceed therefrom; and Peter Martyr being at this time famous
<PB N="304" REF="331"/>for his learning and skill in affairs, was judged a pro∣per instrument in that employment: whereupon the Archbishop, by the command of the King, sent for him over; and, by the consent of the senate of Stras∣burgh, he came over to England<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 124 of this volume.</NOTE>. Cranmer, for some time, entertained him at his house, with all courtesy and humanity, till the King sent him to Oxford, to be professor of divinity; where he first began to ex∣pound the first epistle to the Corinthians, because there∣in were many heads laid down, which concerned the controversies of the times. The Roman Catholics (whereof as yet there were many at Oxford) at first patiently bore Martyr's teaching, frequented his lec∣tures, and indeed seemed to admire his learning: but some of them, especially the heads of houses, laboured to restrain the students from going to his lectures, but yet proceeded no farther. When he came to declare his judgment about the sacrament, they could bear it no longer; and therefore, that they might not only procure him envy, but danger, they first began to ac∣cuse him of teaching contrary to the doctrine of their forefathers, of designing to extirpate their wholesome and decent ceremonies, of profaning the sacrament of the altar, and (as it were) trampling it under his feet. Then (without acquainting him) they affixed papers upon all their church-doors, in English, declaring that to-morrow there should be a public disputation, against the real presence of Christ in the sacrament. By this means, the next day they silled the schools, disposed their party in every place, commanding them to make a noise, to raise tumults, and, if need were, to fight with any that should oppose them. Many went, not only of the scholars, but of the townsmen, some to see the event of this business, others to assist their friends, in case they should fall together by the ears. Martyr, in the mean time, being wholly ignorant of the affair,
<PB N="305" REF="332"/>was in his house preparing himself in his usual manner to read his lecture, till some of his friends (observing the unusual concourse of people) went to him, and opening the business to him, would have persuaded him not to go; but he rejected their advice, and in his way was met by Dr. Smith's boy, with a letter from his master, wherein he challenged him to a disputation. On this, Martyr's friends again earnestly solicited him to return home; but he was still resolute; and so going to the schools, when his adversaries provoked him, he endeavoured by a modest speech to quiet them, saying, that he refused not to dispute, but only disliked the time, for that he came to read his lecture; and, having somewhat quieted them, he went on with his lecture to the admiration of all. They, who before admired him for his singular learning and eloquence, now much more did so for his constancy. For notwithstanding the murmurs of the people, and the rage of his ad∣versaries, he went on without the least change of his colour, or hesitation of his voice, or trembling, or any thing that might imply the least fear. Having ended his lecture, his adversaries began again with great cla∣mour to provoke him to a disputation, nor would they accept of his modest excuse, when he told them that he would dispute at another time; that he was not now prepared, they having concealed their questions from him, without setting them up in public as they used to do. To this they replied, that he, who had read his lectures about the Lord's supper, could not be unprovided to dispute on the same subject. He answered, that he durst not undertake such a work with∣out acquainting the King of it, especially as the thing tended to sedition. He told them also, that to a law∣ful disputation it was requisite that the question should be agreed on; that moderators should be appointed, by whose judgment all things should be determined; and that they should have notaries to write the argu∣ments on both sides. Whereas, he said, none of these
<PB N="306" REF="333"/>things be ready, and the night draws on that we shall want time to discuss so great a controversy.</P>
<P>His adversaries would not be satisfied with these just reasons, but all were like to fall together by the ears: whereupon the Vice-Chancellor interposed his authority, requiring P. Martyr, and Dr. Smith, to meet at his house, with their friends on both sides, where they should agree upon the questions, and the time and or∣der of disputing. In the mean time, he commanded the beadles to dissolve the assembly; and taking Mar∣tyr by the hand, led him forth, and safely conducted him to his own house. At the time appointed, Martyr, accompanied with some of his friends, went to the Vice-Chancellor's house, with Dr. Siddal, and Curtop, who were at that time zealous for the reformation, though afterwards in the reign of Queen Mary they deserted it. Smith did the same, taking with him Dr. Cole and Oglethorpe, and three other Doctors of di∣vinity. They contended some time about the laws of the disputation; but at length the questions were agreed upon, and the time and place appointed for it. In the mean time, by their mutual consents, the King was made acquainted with it, that he might send down his delegates, to order the disputation aright. Smith, be∣ing apprehensive on account of his raising the former tumult, fled before the day came, first into Scotland, and from thence to Louvain in Brabant. At the time appointed, the King's delegates came. In their pre∣sence Martyr disputed four days, with three of the Popish Doctors, Tresham, Chad, and Morgan, where∣in he shewed excellent learning; and because his adver∣saries scattered abroad many false reports, he afterwards printed the whole disputation. The insurrection hap∣pening in Devonshire and Oxfordshire<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 103 of this volume.</NOTE> some time after, many threatened the death of Martyr, so that he could neither read his lectures, nor safely remain in
<PB N="307" REF="334"/>Oxford; on which he was safely conveyed by his friends to London, which the King was much pleased at; and when his wife and family could not with safety re∣main at his house, his friends hid them, till the sediti∣ous multitude were departed out of Oxford; and, after the suppression of the rebellion, Martyr returned again to his wonted labours. But his adversaries often raising tumults before his house in the night, throwing stones at his door, and breaking his windows, the King, to provide for his safety, made him Dean of Christ's church, allotting him a fine house, and pleasant gar∣den. He was much valued by his Majesty, and high∣ly esteemed by Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, and all that favoured the Reformation. Cranmer made great use of his advice in settling the government of the church: but in the beginning of Mary's reign, Martyr was forbidden the exercise of his place, and commanded not to set a foot out of his own doors, nor to carry any thing thence. On this he wrote to his friends, shewing what danger he was in, and plead∣ing the public faith given to him when he was sent for by King Edward VI. By this means he got leave to come to London; where it was disputed in the coun∣cil, whether he should be imprisoned; because, some said, he had done much hurt to their religion: but af∣ter debate it was concluded, that, as he came into England on the public faith, he should be safely dis∣missed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 193 of this volume.</NOTE>. Whereupon, sending him public letters, signed with the Queen's own hand, he went first to Antwerp, from thence to Cologne, and thence to Strasburgh, from whence he came: where he was entertained with much joy, by his old friends, and re∣stored to his former place.</P>
<P>Yet here he was persecuted by his enemies, who sug∣gested to the senate, that he differed in judgment from
<PB N="308" REF="335"/>the confession of Augsburgh<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See vol. ii. page 128 of this work.</NOTE>, about Christ's presence in the sacrament of the Lord's supper, which might cause much trouble in the church, and that he refused to sign the articles of agreement between Luther and Bucer about this matter: whereupon Martyr wrote to the senate, that there was nothing in that confession rightly understood which he did not concur with; and that if his text, at any time, should lead him to speak of that subject, he would do it so modestly, that it should give no offence; and that his not subscribing to the agreement between Luther and Bucer (wherein, amongst other things, they had set down, that they which wanted true faith did nevertheless eat the body of Christ) ought not to be objected to him, for that he could not assent thereto, but he must give offence to the Helvetian, English, French, and Geneva churches: and that Bucer himself, in England, had taught far otherwise. With this answer the senate was satisfied; and he, and Zanchie, taught diligently both divinity and philosophy in that city: but soon after Pellican dying at Zurich, the senate there chose Martyr in his room, and presently sent for him, desiring the senate of Strasburgh would consent to the removal: which they did, though very unwillingly; and Martyr em∣bracing it the more readily, on account of the opposi∣tion he still met with at Strasburgh, departed, to the great grief of his friends, in 1556, John Jewel (afterwards Bishop of Sarum) accompanying him.</P>
<P>There he was well entertained, by the senate, schools, ministers, and all good men. He resided for some time with his old friend Bullinger. The senate, to shew how greatly they esteemed him, made him free of their commonwealth, that he might not live among them as a stranger, but as a citizen. Here, by the advice of his friends, and to obtain issue,
<PB N="309" REF="336"/>he married again, (six years after the death of his first wife) one Catherine Marenda, who for religion had left her own country, and lived at Geneva in good repu∣tation. As he was greatly valued by the people of Zurich, so he loved them exceedingly. He was always ready to be serviceable to other churches, as appeared in many instances.</P>
<P>Soon after this, he fell sick of a fever, made his will, and, to his friends that visited him, he spake chearfully and comfortably, telling them that his body was weak, but inwardly he enjoyed much peace and comfort. He made before them an excellent confes∣sion of his faith, concluding thus, "This is my faith, and they that teach otherwise, to the withdrawing of men from God, God will destroy them." He gave them his hand, and bidding them farewel, gave up the ghost, A. D. 1562, aged sixty-two years.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> Dr. THOMAS CRANMER.</HEAD>
<P>This renowned prelate, of whom so frequent mention has been made in this work, was born on July 2, 1489, at Afracton, in Nortinghamshire, and was the son of Thomas Cranmer, a gentleman possessed of a genteel fortune, and descended of a Norman family which came to England with William the Conqueror, and for some ages was seated at Cranmer-hall in Leicestershire. Young Cranmer was put to learn the grammar under a parish-clerk, with whom he suffered much and improved little. At the age of fourteen he was sent to the university of Cambridge, where for eight years he spent his time in reading, the subtilities and jargon of the scholastic writers. However, after∣wards he applied himself closely to the study of the best Latin authors. He took his degree of master of arts, and was chosen fellow of Jesus college. After that he married a wife in 1525, and thereby losing his fellow∣ship, he was chosen divinity-reader in Buckingham

<PB N="310" REF="339"/>college; but, his wife dying in childbed in 1526, the master and fellows chose him again into Jesus college: after which he commenced Doctor of divi∣nity, in 1528. From thence he was chosen a fellow in Cardinal Wolsey's college, in Oxford; but fore∣seeing the danger which afterwards followed, he refu∣sed that place. Whilst he was in Cambridge, the dis∣pute arose concerning King Henry's divorce, from his brother's widow, and the plague breaking forth at Cambridge, Dr. Cranmer retired to Waltham cross, where he proposed an expedient touching the divorce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 393 of vol. ii. of this work, where Dr. Cranmer is by mistake called professor at Oxford.</NOTE>, with which Henry was so well pleased, that he ordered the Doctor to write his sentiments at large upon the subject: and commanded Thomas Earl of Wiltshire, father of Anne Boleyn, to provide him with retired lodgings, books, and whatever else was necessary for the work. Henry made Cranmer one of his chap∣lains, gave him a good benefice, and nominated him to the archdean<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry of Taunton. When Cranmer, in 1539, had finished his task enjoined by the King, he presented it, supported by the scriptures, and other authorities, to his Majesty; who, having read it, asked him whether he would justify it before the Pope? and Cranmer professing his willingness, Henry hastened his dispatch to the Pope; and sent other learned men abroad to foreign universities, to dispute the question amongst the divines there; where it was concluded, that no such matrimony was lawful by the word of God. There Cranmer and the rest proffered to de∣fend, that, by the law of God, the brother ought not to marry the brother's wife; but none appearing against them, the Pope made Dr. Cranmer his penitentiary in England, Wales and Ireland, and so dismissed them. From thence Cranmer travelled, in 1531, to the Em∣peror's court at Vienna, offering to dispute with his divines upon the same subject: but the learned Cor∣nelius Agrippa, counsellor to the Emperor, receiving,
<PB N="311" REF="340"/>in private conference, full satisfaction from Cranmer, easily persuaded the other learned men that were in the Emperor's court not to contend with the Doctor, who, he said, was in the right; so that no man con∣tradicting him, Cranmer departed from the Emperor, and having travelled all over Germany, he brought home with him into England the opinions of the most learned men that lived in the universities, and courts of Princes. In this journey, he learned all the New Testament by heart; and was confirmed in his former opinion in favour of the Protestant doctrine.</P>
<P>William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, dying August 23, 1533, the King resolved to supply his place with Dr. Cranmer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 410 of vol. ii. of this work.</NOTE>, who was then in Germany about the above-mentioned business, and was loth to take upon him an office of such great dignity in the church; for he knew that there was an oath to be taken to the Pope, before he could be insialled in that place; and he feared what issue the King's divorce might have, not being ignorant of his violent dispo∣sition. He knew that sudden and great changes were dangerous, and that the court, to which he was un∣accustomed, was full of deceits and intrigues; that he must in all things obey the King's will, and that if he tripped in any the most trivial affair, there would be some, who, envying his advancement, would take the advantage to tumble him headlong down. He also was now fallen in love with a young maid, Osiender's niece, whom he determined to marry, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh he knew it was forbidden by law for a priest to marry, or for a man to be made a priest who had married a second wife. Weighing these things seriously within himself, when he was sent for by the King to return home as soon as he could, he stayed in Germany several months, framing one excuse or other, hoping that in the mean time some other might get the archbishopric: but
<PB N="312" REF="341"/>such were the times then that every man feared the slipperiness of the place, and declined it. At last Cranmer, having privately espoused his wife at Nu∣remberg, returned home, and was consecrated Arch∣bishop of Canterbury by John Langland Bishop of Lincoln, John Vesey Bishop of Exeter, and Henry Standish Bishop of St. Asaph, on March 30, 1534: but previously made a protestation against the usual oath to the Pope, which he was obliged to take; and when he gave the Pope's bull into the King's hand, said, "That he would never receive a bishopric of England, but from him who was the head of England, nor take an oath that was derogatory to the King's autho∣rity." Thus being made Archbishop, he carried him∣self as formerly he had done, rising every morning at five o'clock to his study; after dinner, if he had no suitors, he spent an hour at chess, and so to his study again. He was naturally very charitable and gentle, so ready to forgive and forget wrongs that it grew into a proverb, "Do my Lord of Canterbury a shrewd turn, and he will be your friend as long as you live." He was so free from passion, that he never miscalled the meanest of his servants; he relieved many that were in want; was just in paying all men; so that when he was cast into prison, he owed no man a farthing. The whole weight of the reformation lay upon him: and it is with regret that we observe his zeal's having hurried him beyond his usual moderation in the case of Joan Boucher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 100 of this volume.</NOTE>. However, his charity was very extensive to the poor, for whom, being sick, lame or wounded, &amp;c. he provided lodgings, and appointed an almoner, physician, and surgeon to attend them, and they had daily hot broth and meat sent to them from the primate's kitchen. We have had frequent opportuni∣ties of taking notice of the Archbishop's character in the course of this work: and shall now give an account
<PB N="313" REF="342"/>of his behaviour on the discovery of an almost unpa∣ralleled treachery and ingratitude, after the defeat of the last attempt against him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See a full account of both these schemes, pages 39 and 55 of this volume.</NOTE>, in the reign of Henry VIII. Dr. Cox Vicar-general, and Anthony Hussey secretary, whom the King commissioned to find out the authors of the plot against Cranmer, having loitered about Canterbury, without doing any thing to the pur∣pose, his Majesty secretly employed Dr. Lee to make strict inquiry into the affair. Lee, going speedily to Canterbury made himself acquainted with some per∣sons, by whose directions he searched the houses of some suspected persons by night, where he found let∣ters written from Gardiner, which opened the whole plot against Cranmer. These he immediately carried to the King, who from that time withdrew his affec∣tions from those concerned in that affair, and acquainted Cranmer with these letters, bidding him beware of his enemies, now he knew them. Amongst the letters that were found in Kent, one was written by the suffragan of Dover, another by Dr. Barber a civilian; which two men were well esteemed by the Archbishop, and had been promoted, and greatly favoured, by him. When Cranmer had their letters, he sent for them into his study, and said to them, "You two are the men in whom I have always put most confidence, and to whom I have always communicated all my secrets; you must now give me some counsel, for I am shame∣fully abused by two whom I have trusted in the same manner; for these persons have not only disclosed my secrets, but have taken upon them to accuse me of he∣resy, and are become witnesses against me: I require you therefore to give me faithful advice, how I must behave myself towards them." Marry (answered Bar∣ber) such villains and knaves deserve to be hanged up immediately without further trial. Hanging is too good (said the suffragan) and if there want an execu∣tioner
<PB N="314" REF="343"/>I would be the hangman myself. At these words, the Archbishop, lifting up his hands and eves to hea∣ven, said, "O Lord and most merciful God, whom may a man trust in these days? It is true which is said, cursed be he that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm; there was never any man used as I am: but thou, Lord, hast evermore defended me, and lent me one good master (meaning the King) without whose protection I could not be safe for one day; I praise thy holy name for it." Then he pulled the two letters out of his bosom, and gave to them, asking if they knew them? Upon which they fell down upon their knees, and asked forgiveness with many tears. "Well (said the gentle Archbishop) God make you both good men, I never deserved this at your hands: but ask God forgiveness, against whom you have highly of∣fended."</P>
<P>How far Cranmer was instrumental in the work of reformation, has been already sufficiently treated of, in the preceding part of this work, as also his impri∣sonment, recantations, and the manner of his death, on March 21, 1556, when he was in the 67th year of his age.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Of the</HI> LIFE <HI>and</HI> REIGN <HI>of</HI> QUEEN ELIZABETH, <HI>and the State of</HI> RELIGION <HI>from</HI> 1558 <HI>to</HI> 1603.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen Elizabeth proclaimed.</NOTE> QUEEN Mary's death being com∣municated by the privy council to the Lords lately assembled in parliament, it was unanimously resolved to proclaim
<PB N="315" REF="344"/>the Princess Elizabeth. The majority of the peers were either altogether indifferent about religion, or se∣cretly favoured the reformation; and the rest believed that the Popish religion was too firmly established, to be abolished by a Princess who was no bigot, and had conformed, to the Romish religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 185 of this volume.</NOTE>. The Lords having deputed Nicholas Heath, Archbishop of York, to signify their resolution to the Commons, it was unanimously agreed to proclaim the Princess Elizabeth, as next in succession, according to her fa∣ther's appointment. Upon this Elizabeth was pro∣claimed Queen of England, by sound of trumpets, and loud acclamations, first in the Palace-yard at Westminster, and then in London<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">She was then at Hatfield in Hertfordshire, and being addressed by all the Bishops, then living, on their knees, at Highgate, in her way to London, she allowed all of them, except Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London, to kiss her hand.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Elizabeth was now but twenty-five years of age; but her natural abilities, the transactions of the late reign, and the difficulties she had to deal with, had furnished and improved her beyond the expectations of her age: and of this early sufficiency she gave good proof in the choice of her council. She thought it most adviseable to intermix Papists and Protestants at the board, that, by this means, neither party should despair of her favour, and the ballance would be best kept in her own hands. The Roman Catholic part were, Nicholas Heath Archbishop of York, William Pawlet Marquis of Winchester Lord Treasurer, Henry Fitzalan Earl of Arundel, Francis Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury, Edward Stanley Earl of Derby, William Herbert Earl of Pembroke, Edward Lord Clinton Admiral, William Lord Howard of Effingham Lord Chamberlain, Sir Thomas Cheney, Sir William Petre, Sir John Mason, Sir Richard Sackville, and Dr. Ni∣cholas Wotton, Dean of Canterbury. These were all
<PB N="316" REF="345"/>privy counsellors to the late Queen. The others of the reformed persuasion (as Cambden reports) were, William Parr Marquis of Northampton, Francis Russel Earl of Bedford, Sir Thomas Parr, Sir Ed∣ward Rogers, Sir Ambrose Cave, Sir Francis Knolles, and Sir William Cecil: to which number, Sir Ni∣cholas Bacon was soon added. But that two of this last division, viz. Bedford and Cecil, conformed to the Roman Catholic religion in the late reign, may be easily collected from their having a share in the public business. At her first entering upon the govern∣ment, she selected a sort of cabinet-council from some of the Protestant party, and with these she concerted measures for retrieving the <HI>reformation;</HI> but this was to be done with great precaution, and gradual ad∣vances. In the first place, therefore, she took care to settle the magistracy, and secure the kingdom from disturbance: and to prevent confederacies and invasions from abroad, she dispatched her ambassadors to no∣tify her accession to foreign Princes, and her desire to maintain their friendship<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Karne, Queen Mary's agent at Rome, was instruct∣ed to inform Pope Paul IV. of the death of that Princess, and Eliza∣beth's accession, together with her desire that there might be a mutual communication of good offices between them. Paul answered, "That the kingdom of England was held in fee of the apostolic see; that she could not succeed, being illegitimate; that he could not con∣tradict the declaration of Clement VII. and Paul III. that it was a great boldness to assume the name and government of it, without his consent: yet being desirous to shew a fatherly affection, if she would rencunce her pretensions, and refer herself wholly to his free disposition, he would do whatsoever might be done with the honour of the apostolic see," Elizabeth very little regarded the pontiff's remonstrance.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">Philip of Spain solicits, her in marriage.</NOTE> The King of Spain being informed of his Queen's death, ordered the Count of Feria, his ambassador at London, to address Elizabeth for marriage, giving her an assurance of the Pope's dispensation for that pur∣pose. Philip was not only willing to keep his English
<PB N="317" REF="346"/>title and interest, but apprehensive lest the British do∣minions should fall into a union with France by the Queen of Scotland's pretensions. The Queen was un∣resolved in her answer for some time; an overture of this kind from so great a Prince, and one who had formerly been very much her friend, was not suddenly to be refused. Whether Philip's former kindness pro∣ceeded from real friendship or state-policy is not the question; the favour was to be interpreted in the fairest sense. These considerations kept the Queen-sometime in suspense upon the overture. At last, looking farther into the consequence, she perceived that the marrying the wife's sister was equally forbid∣den, with entering into the same relation with the brother's wife; that, such an engagement standing condemned by the holy scriptures, the Pope's dispen∣sation could never disentangle the matter. Besides, by engaging with her sister's husband, she must ne∣cessarily own herself the issue of an unlawful marriage, which she might think she had no reason to suspect, considering the public determinations both at home and abroad in favour of her father's divorce from Cathe∣rine of Spain. However, she returned King Philip's address the smoothest refusal, shewing herself the ra∣ther disinclined to marriage, than denying it upon any other score. But this Prince renewing his application by several letters, seemed to have gained some ground in her affections, for she made no scruple to commend him for the reservedness and decency of his behaviour, saying that she should value herself in imitating his conduct. This discourse made the Protestant courtiers apprehensive of an impression, and that the King might probably obtain her. Therefore, to prevent this alliance, they ventured to remonstrate loudly against the haughti∣ness of the Spaniard: and some of her council, whom she admitted to the highest confidence, told her, that herself, her friends, and the kingdom, were utterly ruined, if she owned the papal authority, either in dis∣pensing,
<PB N="318" REF="347"/>or any other matter; that two Popes had pronounced her mother's marriage unlawful; that up∣on this sentence the Queen of Scots had put up her claim to the English crown; that the Pope would never reverse this judgment of his predecessors; that it was in vain to expect justice from the court of Rome, who had shewn themselves so partial against her mother; and that the French King was now trying his utmost with that see, that Mary Queen of Scotland might be declared Sove∣reign of England.</P>
<P>The Queen, having forthese reasons resolved against the marriage,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Elizabeth intends restoring the re∣formation.</NOTE> believed that nothing would more effectually put a stop to Philip's importunity, than a speedy alteration of religion. She therefore consulted her cabinet-council upon the proper mea∣sures for recovering the church to the condition it was left in by her brother King Edward. To proceed with the greater security, the danger of the enterprise, to∣gether with the method for disentangling the govern∣ment, was laid before the board. The danger might be ranged under two heads, foreign and domestic. From abroad, her Majesty might expect, that the Pope would excommunicate her, and encourage an invasion. It was likewise not improbable that the French King might take his advantage of the opportunity, break off the treaty at Cambray, and solicit the Queen of Scotland to make war upon England. Neither was it improbable but the Irish, being malecontents, and so warmly attached to the church of Rome, might rise in rebellion: and lastly, the King of Spain's great power, and neighbourhood in the Low Countries, was no fa∣vourable circumstance. The remedies in counterbalance were these; that as to the Pope's excommunication, it was only an insignificant noise, powder without ball, and was to be despised; that the French, if they of∣fered a peace, were to be closed with; if not, it was thought worth while to court their friendship, as it
<PB N="319" REF="348"/>brought that of Scotland along with it. The Protes∣tants in France and Scotland were to be encouraged, and <HI>divisions in religion fomented.</HI> The garrisons in Ber∣wick, and upon the borders, were to be reinforced, and the same securities provided in Ireland. A good cor∣respondence with the Spaniards was to be preserved, and the old alliance with the house of Burgundy re∣newed.</P>
<P>The cabinet foresaw, that the danger at home would arise from the nobility dismissed the council-board; from the Bishops and other ecclesiastics, who must lose their preferments; from the Judges and Justices of Peace, employed in the late reign; and, in short, from all hearty Papists of wealth and distinction. The way to make those people inoffensive, was to throw them out of commission, and to bring none but Protestants into the administration; to purge the universities; place new presidents in the colleges, and turn out the masters at Winchester, Eaton, and other schools. It was resolved, that the Papists must not only be put out of business, but care must be taken to sink their cha∣racter, and lessen their interest, so long as they continu∣ed of that persuasion: and if some of them should happen to comply with the alteration in the church, they were not to be trusted; it being natural for every man to watch his opportunity, to recover his old ground, and to like that establishment best which him∣self had a hand in settling: and particularly, as to the non-complying Bishops, they must be reduced by some new parliamentary provision: <HI>premunire</HI> must be play∣ed upon them; and when once they were in <HI>misericor∣dia</HI> they were not to be pardoned without entire sub∣mission and conformity; that by hampering them close, and executing the laws strictly, her Majesty's occa∣sions for money may be somewhat supplied: that those Protestants who affected improper alterations, and were for throwing the ecclesiastical polity into a new form, ought to receive an early check: that it was by no
<PB N="320" REF="349"/>means adviseable to allow more than one church: <HI>that the free exercise of different religions would prove an ever∣lasting principle of sedition and disturbance,</HI> especially in a nation of so martial a genius as the English. How∣ever, to prevent discontents, the reformed <HI>liturgy</HI> ought to be reviewed, and made as inoffensive to all parties as may be: that this affair should be referred to Parker, Bill, May, Cox, Grindal, Whitehead, and Pilkington; these divines being all remarkable for learning and temper; and that Sir Thomas Smith, (who is supposed to have drawn this advice) was to bring them together, and have a share in the consulta∣tion: that when the debate was settled, and the book finished, it was to be presented to the Queen, and, after her approbation, laid before the parliament; and that besides this committee, other persons of learning and character should have the perusal of the book, to give it a farther reputation: that before the reviewed ser∣vice was published, there must be a strict prohibition of all innovation: that frequent changes lessened the authority of a government, and therefore ought to be prevented as much as possible; besides the giving out orders would suggest an instance of duty to the subjects, and train them to the practice of obedience: and as to her Majesty, she may keep to the same form of religion, unless with respect to the communion on high festivals; at which time her Highness may re∣ceive it with such a latitude of ceremonies, as she shall think fit: that where there are more priests than one at mass, they may all communicate in both kinds: and for farther relief of her Highness's conscience, if need be, the office of the mass may be the seldomer read, and some other devout prayers used instead of it: and lastly, to the question, what noblemen were to be made privy to this design, before it was opened to the whole council? the answer was, that none but the Marquis of Northampton, the Earl of Bedford, the
<PB N="321" REF="350"/>Earl of Pembroke, Sir John Grey of Pyrgo, and Wil∣liam Cecil, were to be trusted with the secret.</P>
<P>But the Queen having discharged all those commit∣ted for religion in the late reign, and given the exiles leave to return home, the inclinations of the court were easily discovered. The Protestants presuming upon this knowledge, ventured beyond the protection of the constitution; and meeting first in private houses, and afterwards in churches, preached their persuasion, and drew great audiences after them. The Papists, on the other side, not dropping their defence, the peo∣ple began to ruffle and grow warm in the controversy: and thus images were pulled down in several churches, and the priests affronted. The Queen, to keep the kingdom quiet, and prevent unseasonable squabbling,<NOTE PLACE="inter">A proclama∣tion forbid∣ing preaching.</NOTE> published a proclamation for silencing the pulpit, and commanded all disputes of this nature should be forborn: and thus, for some time, none were allowed to preach without a licence under the broad seal. But to give some discovery of what she intended, she allowed the liberty of reading the epistles and gospels in English, provided it was done without expounding; the Lord's prayer, the creed, and the litany, might likewise be said in the same language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rainsford, a gentleman belonging to the court, petitioned Elizabeth, that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the four Evan∣gelists, who had been long imprisoned in a Latin translation, might walk abroad, as formerly, in the English tongue; but her Majesty replied, "That she should first endeavour to know the minds of the prisoners, who perhaps desired no such liberty as he demanded."</NOTE>. As to the rest of the ser∣vice, it was to go on by the rubric of the missals and breviaries, till the Queen and parliament had farther debated this matter.</P>
<P>A. D. 1559.] On January 13, the day before the coronation,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen E∣lizabeth crowned.</NOTE> there was a splendid cavalcade from the Tower to Westminster. The Queen, before she stepped into her
<PB N="322" REF="351"/>coach, is said to have made a short ejaculation, heard by those near her, returning God thanks for preserving her to so happy a day: acknowledging her being rescued by Providence from the extremity of danger, and comparing it with Daniel's deliverance from the den of lions. She was saluted, as she passed, with all imaginable marks of duty and affection: and her return to these acclamations was very engaging, both in air and gestures. The manner of her receiving an English Bible was particularly striking: it was let down from one of the triumphal arches, at the Little Con∣duit in Cheapside, and presented by a figure resembling Truth. When she discovered the present, she first kissed her hands, and then receiving the book, kissed it, laid it to her breast, promised to read it, and re∣turned the city more thanks for this present, than for all the rest of great value she had already received. It must be owned she was <HI>a great mistress of behaviour,</HI> and perfectly understood the art of making herself po∣pular, without expence. Next day she was crowned at Westminster, by Owen Oglethorpe, Bishop of Car∣lisle: the solemnity was performed according to anci∣ent custom, and directed by the Roman Pontifical. None but the Bishop of Carlisle could be prevailed on to officiate at the coronation. Archbishop Heath, and the rest of that order, declined that business. They were afraid that the impressions of her Protestant edu∣cation were not worn out: this suspicion was confirmed by her late forbidding a Bishop to elevate the host for adoration. Her permitting some of the church-service in English was also much disliked. However, the Queen appeared very religious, came constantly to the closet or chapel at the hours of prayer, and behaved her∣self there with seeming great devotion. She wore black in Lent, and was very attentive at the sermon; tho' she used to say, she had rather address God Almighty in prayer, and converse more immediately with him, than hear a learned and rhetorical discourse upon the
<PB N="323" REF="352"/>divine attributes. She had honourable sentiments of the use of the cross, of the blessed Virgin, and of other saints; and never mentioned them but with regard and reverence. The reader may possibly be at a loss, why the Queen risqued her being refused at the coronation, by so many Bishops of the Roman persuasion: for were not William Barlow, John Scory, and Miles Cover∣dale, the Protestantt Bishops of Wells, Chichester, and Exeter, living? Were not these three Prelates all hearty in the reformation? Why then was not the set∣ting the crown on her head offered to one of these? To this it may be answered, that these three Bishops were then actually deprived<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 193, 194, and 195 of this volume.</NOTE>; and the process not being re∣versed, their character might be questionable. Be∣sides, she had reason to believe these three Prelates would have scrupled the <HI>ceremoniale:</HI> and to have al∣tered it to their approbation, might probably have drawn a blemish upon the solemnity, and represented her to disadvantage in foreign courts. And after all, it is possible the form might sit easy enough upon her mind, and her conscience give her leave to humour the junc∣ture.</P>
<P>Upon Elizabeth's accession to the throne, the Eng∣lish exiles at Geneva seemed willing to make up the former difference with their brethren<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 228 of this volume.</NOTE>, and moved towards a reconciliation. To this purpose they dis∣patched William Keth, one of their congregation, to the English at Arrow, Basil, Strasburgh, Worms, Franckfort, &amp;c. In their letter to those of Arrow and Franckfort, they express a strong inclination to recover a right understanding, and come up to a per∣fect harmony with the rest of the English: but then their proposals were somewhat narrow and reflecting; they called the ceremonies trifles, they proposed the best reformed churches, meaning Calvin's congrega∣tion,
<PB N="324" REF="353"/>for the measures of agreement. They were sen∣sible that clashing would disserve the reformation, and report them to disadvantage among the Papists: and they would gladly have an end put to their former dis∣putes; but then the accommodation must be made up∣on their own terms. This letter was subscribed, in the name of the whole church, by Christopher Good∣man, Miles Coverdale, John Knox, Anthony Gilby, William Whitingham, and six others. The English church at Franckfort, in their answer to this letter, de∣clare themselves pleased with this friendly overture, but are sorry it came no sooner; for now, almost all those of the congregation, with whom they contested at Franckfort, were removed. However, they did not question but that they would drop their resentment, and look upon them as brethren. As for ceremonies, the settling of that point must neither be referred to Franckfort nor Geneva: the divines in England, with the concurrence of parliament, must put an end to that controversy. They hoped the reformation would recover, and not be clogged with an overweight of ce∣remonies: and therefore, provided nothing immoral was imposed, they were resolved to acquiesce in the public establishment, and wish their brethren of Ge∣neva may be equally resigning. And since all the re∣formed abroad differ in rites, and yet agree in doctrine, they see no reason why the English church may not be allowed the same latitude. However, if any ceremo∣nies, really exceptionable, should happen to be put upon them, they promised, at their return home, to join with them in an address for removing such grie∣vance. This letter was signed, in the name of the church, by James Pilkington, Richard Beesley, Henry Knolles, Andrew Nowel, and seven others.</P>
<P>The English at Geneva now returned home, ex∣cepting a few that stayed to finish <HI>their translation of the Bible.</HI> They had already made a version of the Psalms, which they published by itself, and dedicated to the
<PB N="325" REF="354"/>Queen. On Jan. 25, the parliament met at Westminster; and Sir Nicholas Bacon, the Lord Keeper, opened the session with a speech, suggesting to them what business they were to go upon, which was ranged under three heads; viz. religion, redressing grievances, and reform∣ing the administration. As to religion, the Lord-Keeper acquainted the two houses, "That the honour of God Almighty was the Queen's principal concern: that this ought to have the preference in their debates: that religion was the furest basis for the support of the commonwealth: that the civil administration ought to take its measures from hence; and this world be go∣verned upon views of the other. That discharge of duty in this particular would derive success upon all the rest: but remissness and negligence in that respect must have an unfortunate eff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct upon other provisions; for not being settled upon strength and clearness of principle, they must of course be exposed to clearness and change; circumstances which bring discredit upon any public establishment, and ought to be particularly avoided in matters of faith and religion. Her High∣ness therefore (continues the Lord Keeper) earnestly re∣quires you, that, in regard to the duty you owe to God and her Majesty, the concern you have for your coun∣try and yourselves, you would recollect your thoughts, and exert your endeavours: that you would spare no pains for the establishing that which▪ after your utmost inquiry, shall be judged most serviceable: and that, in the managing this debate, no consideration of superi∣ority, power, interest, or pleasure, no ostentation of learning, nor contest for victory, may prevail upon you. And to this purpose her Majesty expects you should decline squabbling, heat of disputation, and scholastic arguing; as such niceties, and methods of contention, are below the dignity of the subject, and unbecoming a parliamentary assembly. Besides there is a great deal of time unnecessarily spent this way: and when men
<PB N="326" REF="355"/>harangue, and wrangle, to shew their parts, they sel∣dom agree in any serviceable resolves: and as your own debates ought to be governed by temper, gravity, and good humour, so it is proper some public provision should be made, to check contention, and contumelious behaviour <HI>without doors;</HI> and that no party-language, no terms of reproach, nor provoking distinctions, should be kept up in the kingdom. That the names of Here∣tic, Schismatic, Papist, and such like, should be laid aside and forgotten; for what do these discriminations tend to, unless it be to perpetuate divisions, to en∣courage factions, to inflame men's spirits, and make them hate and do mischief to each other? In the management of this affair touching religion, two ex∣tremes are to be carefully avoided; on the one hand, there must be a guard against unlawful worship and superstition; and, on the other, things must not be left in such a loose regulation, as to occasion indif∣ferency in religion, and contempt of holy things. The exemplary punishment of undue worship and supersti∣tion, and especially of Atheism and immorality, is clear from the history of all ages, and needs not be particularly recited: and the blessings of Providence are no less remarkable on the contrary practice. And, for your farther encouragement, I think I may affirm, that neither good King Hezekiah, nor the noble Queen Esther, had a stronger zeal to discharge error, and reform what's amiss, than our Sovereign Lady has to recommend herself to the approbation of God Almighty. Let therefore the consideration of our duty to God, the terror of his judgments, the sense of his goodness, the love to our country and ourselves, and the encouragement of so inviting an example in the Queen, put us upon our best endeavours for pro∣viding such laws, as may tend to the honour of God, the settlement of his church, and the repose of the kingdom." Thus closed the Lord Keeper's speech concerning religion.</P>
<PB N="327" REF="356"/>
<P>The convocation met the next day after the parlia∣ment; and, after a mass of the Holy Ghost, Bonner Bishop of London opened the meeting with a short discourse; for, in the vacancy of the see of Canter∣bury, the Bishop of London was commonly president of the convocation. But this post was not annexed to the see of London by common right, but by the choice of the dean and chapter of Canterbury. For in case a convocation meets, when the see of Canterbury happens to be vacant, the prior and convent formerly, but since the reformation the dean and chapter, direct a commission to some Bishop to represent them; for being beneath an episcopal character, they are un∣qualified to preside in person in the upper house. They commonly make the Bishop of London their repre∣sentative upon such occasions; notwithstanding they have the liberty of pitching upon any other: and thus in the convocation held in the year 1532, when the see of Canterbury was void by the death of Arch∣bishop Warham, the convent chose the Bishop of St. Asaph for their commissioner; who upon the strength of this representation presided in the convo∣cation. Farther they are not tied to the nomination of a single Bishop, but may join two or three in the instrument for this purpose: and thus it happened at present, the Bishops of Worcester and Coventry being joined with Bonner. This prelate told them, that notwithstanding a Latin sermon had been customary on such occasions, yet now it was not to be expected; because the Queen had forbidden any sermons in that church, till farther order from her Majesty. Nicholas Harpsfield, Doctor of Law, and Archdea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of Can∣terbury, was chosen prolocutor. The only remarkable business done by this convocation was, the drawing up of certain articles in defence of the religion esta∣blished. This paper was couched by way of address to the Bishops, who were to lay it before the Lords in parliament. The substance of it is as follows: They
<PB N="328" REF="357"/>acquaint the Bishops, that being informed by public fame, that many points of religion, hitherto unani∣mously received by the whole church, and handed down without interruption from the Apostles, were now called in question, and particularly the articles underwritten; for this reason they thought themselves concerned to provide in the best manner they could for the salvation of themselves, and the people com∣mitted to their charge. Therefore being supported with the precedent of their predecessors upon a resem∣bling occasion, they thought themselves obliged to publish their belief of the following articles, appealing to God, in the most solemn manner, for the sincerity of their declaration. First, "That, in the sacrament of the altar, by virtue of the words of consecration duly pronounced by the priest, the natural body and blood of Christ, conceived of the blessed virgin, are really present under the species of bread and wine." Secondly, "That, after the consecration, the substance of bread and wine does not remain, nor any other substance but that of God and man." Thirdly, "That the true or real body of Christ, and his real blood, is offered in the mass, as a propitiatory sacrifice for the quick and dead." Fourthly, "That the supreme power of feeding and governing the church militant, and confirming their brethren, is given to the apostle St. Peter, and his lawful successors in the apostolic see, who represent our Saviour for this purpose." Fifthly, "That an authority for debating and settling those things which belong to faith, the sacraments, and discipline of the church, is a privilege which has always, and ought to belong to the hierarchy, and not to the laity; the Holy Spirit having given the for∣mer a commission for these functions." These articles being put into Bishop Bonner's hands, were by him presented to the Lord Keeper Bacon: and in the next session Bonner acquainted the lower house of convo∣cation, that an instrument was sent up from both the
<PB N="329" REF="358"/>universities, attested by a public notary, in which the articles were all subscribed excepting the last.</P>
<P>All the effect this declaration had with the house of Lords and the Queen, was the bringing on a disputa∣tion between the Roman Catholics and the reformed.<NOTE PLACE="inter">A aisputation be∣tween the Papists and Protestants at Westminster.</NOTE> This conference was begun, by the Queen's orders, on March 31, at the abbey-church of Westminster. The Archbishop of York, being one of the council, was required, in her Majesty's name, to intimate her pleasure to some of the Bishops: and to make choice of eight, nine, or ten, of their own party, to manage a dispute with an equal number of the other persuasion. Archbishop Heath, and the other Bishops, consented to the motion, and the points proposed to be argued. Upon this, at the Queen's instance, it was mutually agreed, that, to prevent wrangling, the debate should be managed in writing: that the Bishops, as persons of the best qua∣lity, should give in their papers in the first place; and that the other party should return them their answer in writing the same day: and the papers which were mu∣tually exchanged one day, should be reciprocally an∣swered another. And because the issue of this dispute might give some measures to the parliament, the Lords desired, that the papers might be penned in English: which was likewise agreed to by both parties. The preliminaries being all settled, the conference began at the time and place above-mentioned; the privy council, a great part of the nobility, and some of the house of Commons, being present. The persons made choice of, to engage in the controversy, were these; for the Roman Catholics, White Bishop of Winchester, Bayn Bishop of Litchfield, Scot Bishop of Chester, Watson Bishop of Lincoln, Dr. Cole Dean of St. Paul's, Dr. Harpsfield Archdeacon of Canter∣bury, Dr. Chadsey Prebendary of St. Paul's, and Dr. Langdale Archdeacon of Lewis. Those for the re∣formation,
<PB N="330" REF="359"/>were Dr. Scory late Bishop of Chichester, Dr. Cox late Dean of Westminster, Mr. Horn late Dean of Durham, Mr. Elmer late Archdeacon of Stow, Mr. Whitehead, Mr. Grindal, Mr Guest, and Mr. Jewel. The points to be argued were these, first, "Whether it is against the word of God, and the custom of the ancient church, to officiate and ad∣minister the sacraments in a language unknown to the people?" Secondly, "Whether every church has au∣thority to appoint, to change, or set aside, ceremo∣nies, and ecclesiastical rit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, provided the lame be done to edification?" Thirdly, "Whether it can be proved by the word of God, that there is offered in the mass a propitiatory sacrifice for the quick and the dead?" The Papists were to defend the negative of the first, and the affirmative of the last question; and the Protestants were to make good the affirmation of the second. And that the disputation might be managed in form, and the order observed, the Lord Keeper took the chair; not that he had any commission from the Queen to determine between the parties, or over∣rule any point in the controversy.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding things had been thus thoroughly adjusted, the Bishops broke the method, and came unprovided with the paper, pretending they had mis∣taken the agreement. However, they said they were prepared to argue the first proposition by word of mouth. The Lord Keeper, after a reprimand for de∣parting from their preliminaries, gave them the liberty to proceed in their own way, they having promised to put their arguments in writing afterwards, and deliver them to the other party. The Papists having appointed Dr. Cole to represent them, and deliver their sense upon the first question, he discharged his commission sometime by speaking off hand, as it was pretended, sometime by reading authorities out of a paper, and sometimes he spoke what was prompted by his party. What he delivered does not appear; for it is plain his argument upon the first question, preserved in Bennet
<PB N="331" REF="360"/>college library, was not his first discourse, but a re∣ply to Horn's paper. This is evident from Cole's speech introductive to his argument: his words are these: "Whereas these men here present, have de∣clared here openly, that it is repugnant and contrary to the word of God, to have the common prayers and ministration of the sacraments in Latin here in England; that all such common prayer and mi∣nistration ought to be, and remain in the English tongue: Ye shall understand, that, to prove this their assertion, they have brought in as yet only one place of scripture, taken out of St. Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, the fourteenth chapter, with certain other places of the holy doctors, whereunto answer is not now to be made. But when the book which they read shall be delivered unto us, according to the appoint∣ment made in that behalf, then, God willing, we shall make answer, as well to the scripture, as other testi∣monies, alledged by them, so all good men may evi∣dently perceive and understand the same scripture to be misconstrued, and perverted from the native and true sense." From hence he proceeds to reply to Horn's paper upon the first question. And here he asserts, first, That divine service, in an unknown tongue, is no contradiction to any plain declaration of scrip∣ture; and, secondly, supposing there were any plain text against this usage, the constant practice of the church ought not to be condemned. This bold pro∣position he endeavours to make good by the following arguments. First, he takes notice, that notwithstanding the keeping the Sabbath or Saturday was expressly com∣manded by God Almighty, yet the church, without any warrant from written revelation, has changed the festival to Sunday. That this alteration, having passed all along without scruple or contest, is a good reason to rely on the authority of the church in other mat∣ters. He observes farther, that when our Saviour washed his disciples feet, he told them it was "for their example, that they should do as he had done."
<PB N="332" REF="361"/>Notwithstanding which express words, the church had, without breach of duty, omitted the imitation. And in the blessed sacrament of the altar, the practice of our Saviour, mentioned in scripture, is not followed in every circumstance; for he celebrated this mystery after supper. From hence he infers, that the church is governed by the devotion of the Holy Spirit; and that, in virtue of this privilege, she is im∣powered to change a custom, even recommended by our Saviour himself; and that, by our Saviour's promise, the authority of the primitive is conveyed down to the present church. And upon this ground the church has barred the laity receiving under both kinds, and pronounced those guilty of heresy who affirm that whole Christ is not contained under either species. He reinforces his reasoning from a text in the Acts, where the council of Jerusalem published their decree in these words: "It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay on you no greater burthens than these necessary things: that ye abstain from meat offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication." Here is a plain precept from the Apostles, and other persons un∣questionably inspired, for abstaining from eating blood, no less than from other things, which are unalterably unlawful; and yet this branch of the decree has not been kept; the church for many ages has dispensed with the command; neither is she blamed by the re∣formed for indulging this latitude. To this he adds another instance, from the Acts of the Apostles, where it is said the Christians sold their estates, lodged the purchase-money with the Apostles, and had all things common. But this charitable precedent was never thought binding to succeeding ages. From all these in∣stances his conclusion is, that supposing the Protestants had the scripture on their side in the case contested, supposing this, which he won't grant, yet since the church is always under the guidance of the Holy Spi∣rit, her decisions are no less to be regarded than those
<PB N="333" REF="362"/>of the Apostles; that this assertion is a plain conse∣quence of our Saviour's promise, "that the Holy Ghost should teach his disciples all things, and guide them into all truth; and that he himself would be with his church till the world's end." To this purpose he cites a passage from St. Austin, where it is said, "that though the church tolerates a great many things, yet she neither approves nor connives at, nor practises, any thing contrary to faith or moral duty."</P>
<P>After thus attempting to establish the Catholic church in this extent of authority, his next effort is, to prove the see of Rome the seat of this authority, and the cen∣ter of unity: but for this he offers nothing but the testimony of Irenaeus, where that church, or probably the city of Rome, is called <HI>potentior principalitas.</HI> From hence he proceeds to shew the danger of schism; that St. Paul conjures the Corinthians, "that they all speak the same thing, and that there be no division among them:" that neither knowledge, faith, good works, nor martyrdom itself, will avail those who are out of the communion of the church; for, as St. Austin speaks, "let a man's pretensions be what they will, whoever is separated from the church of Christ can be no Christian." From hence Cole argues, that the translating the common prayer into the mother-tongue is a breach upon the custom of the universal church; and that such an alteration must of necessity be intro∣ductive of an horrible schism. Then he endeavours to prove, that prayers in an unknown language has been all along the custom of the western church. And here, by a common mistake, he makes Dionysius the Areo∣pagite the first preacher of Christianity in France: he mentions Martialis and Austin the monk, for the con∣version of the Spaniards and Saxons; and takes some notice of the Britons and Germans being brought over to the belief of the gospel: but when he comes to make out his point, that the service was performed in these churches in a language unknown to the people, he of∣fers
<PB N="334" REF="363"/>nothing but the silence of historians. However, to give something of the face of an argument, he af∣firms, the Protestants can never prove, that the church-service in the vulgar tongue was generally practised, either with respect to place or time. Then he proceeds to argue from the permanency of the Latin; that the phrase and construction of this language keeps steady and fixed, whereas that spoken by the common people is strangely floating and uncertain, insomuch that one age is scarcely intelligible to another: that if the church-liturgy should be always reformed to the modern style, and changed as often as language wears, and words grow out of fashion, such frequent alterations would lessen the veneration for holy things, strike off the ad∣vantage of antiquity, and disserve the majesty of reli∣gion. He endeavours to support his reasoning by ta∣king notice, that the laity among the Jews were not permitted to enter either the holy of holies, or the body of the temple: and yet the priests officiated in the first, and the high priest in the latter: that, in the Greek church, the priest consecrates with the curtains drawn before the altar: that the people, by not un∣derstanding the public prayer, have a better opportu∣nity for their own private devotion, which would be disturbed, if they should do nothing but attend to an∣swer Amen: besides, that, in a great church, it is impossible for every body to hear what the priest says. His next effort is somewhat surprising: he affirms, that if it were necessary to officiate in the vulgar tongue, it would follow, that no body could be the better for any prayers, unless he understood them, and heard them when they were said: from whence the inference would be, that the church's prayers for St. Peter in prison signified nothing: each of which consequences, as he argues, are no less than heresy. His last topic is from the ill translation of the Bible. If we should, says he, consent to the English service, we must be obli∣ged to use King Edward's common prayer-book, which
<PB N="335" REF="364"/>consists of versions of Psalms, and other parts of the scripture, in which are several plain mistakes, and deviations from the original: and this, continues he, is downright depraving the holy scriptures; and if the liturgy must be regulated upon this false translation, we may be said to serve God with lies. We ought not therefore to alter the form of the common prayer to that degree as to lose the benefit of all devotion: and yet such must be the issue of this uncharitable conten∣tion, unless our adversaries think fit to acquiesce. The church of God (as St. Paul speaks) has no such cus∣tom as they would bring upon us; and therefore we may put the Apostle's question to them, "What, came the word of God out from you? or came it to you only?" Has the whole church of Christ been all along mistaken, and never seen the fourteenth chapter of St. Paul to the Corinthians? Has the Holy Ghost laid down his office, and discontinued his leading Chris∣tians into all truth, till now of late? St. Austin, in his letter to Julianus the Pelagian, who complained of hard usage in the Eastern church, answers him thus: "In my opinion, father, you ought to have been de∣termined by that part of the world in which our blessed Saviour crowned his chief apostle with martyrdom. You had your first and second birth in the Western church. What makes you endeavour to bring in fo∣reign doctrine upon her? or rather, why would you take away part of that faith you found in her at your baptism?"</P>
<P>Cole pretended, that it was in their power to cite a great many more authorities: however, he was willing to wave this advantage, for fear of being tedious to the audience. That this was Cole's second discourse, for the reading whereof the Bishops insisted so strongly, at the second meeting of the conference, will appear farther by Horn's paper, the purport of which was as follows. He declares, by way of preface, a great regard for the authority of the Catholic church;
<PB N="336" REF="365"/>that they professed an entire submission to all the ar∣ticles of the Apostolical, Nicene, and Athanasian creeds; that they are willing to refer the whole con∣troversy to the holy scriptures and the Catholic church: but then by the Catholic church they do not understand the church of Rome, but that body of Christians who can prove their title to Catholicism from the scriptures, and is under the directions of the Holy Spirit; and that they have the warrant of St. Austin, and other fathers, to restrain the Catholic church to this notion. From hence he proceeds to state the question, first, that by the word of God, the Protes∣tants mean only the written word, or canonical scrip∣tures; and, secondly, by the custom of the primitive church, they understand the general practice of the church for the first five centuries. He first undertakes to prove common prayer in an unknown language is contrary to the word of God. And upon this head he argues at length, and with sufficient force, from 1 Cor. xiv. I shall mention one text cited by Horn from that chapter: <HI>I will pray by the Spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.</HI> From hence he argues that common prayer imports the joint petitions of the congregation, declared by their language; that this definition is approved by St. Austin. There would be no need of forming our prayers into words, says he, unless to discover the mind of the understanding to the people. The ministration of the Lord's supper and baptism (adds Horn) are as it were sermons upon the death and resurrection of Christ: but sermons or representations must be made intelligible language, otherwise they are to no pur∣pose. It is not lawful for a Christian to abuse the gifts of God; and he that prays in an unknown lan∣guage is guilty of this mismanagement; for the use of speech is only to communicate thoughts and discover the mind to the hearer. He fortifies his reasoning from the practice of the Heathen, and the suggestions
<PB N="337" REF="366"/>of natural light; and observes that the Pagans in all countries, though never so slenderly improved, put-up their prayers to their deities, and perform their re∣ligious solemnities in the vulgar language. He then endeavours to prove, that prayers in an unknown tongue are contrary to the practice of the primitive church. He begins with Justin Martyr's apology; where this father, giving an account of the Christian worship to the Roman Emperors, acquaints them, that, at their assemblies on Sundays, the writings of the Apostles and Prophets used to be read; and that after sermon they all stood up and prayed; and that when the Bishop officiated in the communion-service, the peo∣ple all answered Amen. From hence it is evident, that the scriptures were read in the vulgar language; and that the liturgy was understood by the people, otherwise which way could they be qualified to say Amen. This custom may be farther traced in St. Ba∣sil's and St. Chrysostom's liturgies, where the people have a share in the service. For instance, they answer, <HI>Lord have mercy upon us: and with thy spirit: we lift them up unto the Lord, &amp;c.</HI> Now which way could they make these responses, or adjust them to the time, un∣less the public form was drawn up in the common language? Farther, St. Basil, in his letter to the clergy of Nea Caesarea, endeavours to take off some objections to the psalmody used in his church; and having pre∣mised that their practice in this particular was uniform and general, takes notice that the people at church, after having made their confession to God, threw them∣selves into two divisions, and sung the psalms alter∣nately. To these authorities he adds farther testimo∣nies, from St. Ambrose on 1 Cor. xiv. from St. Je∣rome on these words of the same chapter, <HI>How shall be that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen?</HI> To these the testimony of Justinian is subjoined, where the Emperor commands all Bishops and priests to pronounce the liturgic prayers, and the office for baptism, with a
<PB N="338" REF="367"/>loud voice, that the people may hear, and be assisted in their devotions: which benefit they cannot have, unless they understand what is said. And here he founds himself upon the Apostles reasoning, and argues from the xivth of the Corinthians already mentioned.</P>
<P>When Horn had read through his paper, the au∣dience seemed to discover their satisfaction, and give a preference to his arguments: upon which the Bishops alledged, that they had more to offer upon the first question. This was contradicting their former answer; for when Cole had ended his first discourse, the privy council asking them if they had any thing to say farther upon that head, they answered no. Notwith∣standing, to take off all pretences of complaint, the conference was adjourned till Monday following, and the Bishops were ordered to bring in their paper to the second proposition, with a promise that what they had farther prepared on the first question should likewise be heard: and to this both parties agreed. But when the day came, the Bishops insisting upon their reading the supplemental paper to the first question, and refu∣sing to abide by the last compromise, the conference, after some squabble, broke up. White and Watson, Bishops of Winchester and Lincoln, shewing more heat than the rest, and misbehaving themselves to a great degree, were committed to the Tower, and fined. The rest were bound in a recognizance, to appear before the council, where most of them were deeply fined.</P>
<P>As the reformed divines kept close to the conditions of the conference, and came off with advantage upon the first question, so they were no less prepared for the second, which they, in their paper, handled in a masterly and convincing manner</P>
<P>Let us now go back to the senate<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See p. 325 of this volume.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Further proceed∣ings in parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and consider the proceedings there in re∣gard to ecclesiastical affairs. As to the Lords Spiritual, none of them had sum∣mons but such as acted in the late reign. The first bill was
<PB N="339" REF="368"/>for the restitution of tenths, first-fruits, and parson∣ages impropriate to the crown, which Mary had re∣turned to the church. This bill, as a motive to make it pass, sets forth the innumerable and inestimable charges of the royal estate; "that the crown descend∣ed to her Majesty very much incumbered, and lessen∣ed in the revenues; and that the statute of the second and third of Philip and Mary for the extinguishing tenths, &amp;c. was made to the great disherison and de∣cay of the estate royal." From this preamble the statute goes on to repeal the second and third of Philip and Mary, cap. 4; and thus the acts for the payment of tenths, passed in the reign of King Henry VIII. were revived. The Bishops all protested against this reannexing the tenths, &amp;c. to the crown; but the temporal Lords voted for the bill <HI>nemine contradicente:</HI> which was somewhat strange, considering they were, almost all of them, the same members which made the act for returning these things to the church in the late reign. The Queen, desirous of sharing the spoils of the church, yet affecting to appear scrupulous of re∣taining the impropriations vested in the crown, obtain∣ed an act impowering her, on the vacancy of any bishopric, to resume the manors and temporal posses∣sions thereof, making the see a just recompence in parsonages impropriate: it did not pass the Commons without opposition, though carried, on a division, by 134 against 90 voices. All the sees in England and Wales (except Landaff) were either at this time actually vacant, or became so before the end of the year: and whoever looks into the restitution of temporalities, published by Rymer, will see how shame∣fully this power was abused, to the stripping them of all their best manors, under colour of giving them an equi∣valent in impropriations, but in so little a proportion to the real value of the other, that a church-bargain came to be an adage of the same import as Glaucus's exchange. The bishopric of Durham was at first
<PB N="340" REF="369"/>treated as ill as the rest, and, besides being charged with a pension of 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year towards the mainte∣nance of the garrison of Berwick (which was paid all her reign) she seized most of the manors belonging to it, and retained them in her own hands: but this oc∣casioned so general a discontent, and such heavy clamours among the gentlemen and yeomen, who held their lands by much more easy and advantageous tenures under the Bishops, than they could expect to do un∣der the crown, that she was afraid of an insurrection, and restored them all to the see, except the great manor of Sedberg in Northumberland. In vain did the Bishops represent to her the ill consequences which this improverishment of the sees would produce with regard to learning and hospitality, the scandal it would give abroad, the hurt it would do to her own character, and the discredit it would bring on her re∣formation. Elizabeth regarded no remonstrances: and, hot content with plundering them for her own profit, suffered her courtiers to have a share in the prey; Sir W Cecil getting into his hands the best manors in the Soake of Peterborough; Sir Robert Dudley those of the see of Oxford, and other favourites those belong∣ing to Bristol, and the rest of the late erected bishopries. Another power granted her by this parliament, of making rules and statutes for the cathedral and col∣legiate churches, schools, and ecclesiastical corpora∣tions, founded by her father, brother, and sister, was more reasonable in itself, and more careful in its exercise.</P>
<P>The two most material acts which passed this session, were, <HI>one for restoring to the crown its ancient jurisdiction over the state ecclesiastical and spiritual, and abolishing all foreign powers repugnant to the same;</HI> and another for establishing an <HI>uniformity in divine service, and in the administration of the sacraments.</HI> It had been declared by an act in the second parliament of Queen Mary, "to have always been the law of the realm, that the
<PB N="341" REF="370"/>regal office, with all the dignities, prerogatives, au∣thorities, and jurisdictions, thereto belonging, whether invested in male or female, were equally and entirely so invested in the one and the other; so that, whatever a King might do or execute by law, a Queen (being supreme governess, possessor, and inheritor of the crown) might do by the same power to all intents and purposes whatever." In pursuance of this declaratory statute, Queen Elizabeth assumed the <HI>supremacy,</HI> not by the title of <HI>head</HI> of the church, lest it might give offence, but by that of <HI>Supreme Governess:</HI> and to prevent all misconstruction in this point, declared to all her subjects in the injunctions, which she published soon after, "That nothing was or could be meant or intended by the first of the acts above mentioned, than what was acknowledged to be due to her late father and brother; and that she neither did nor should claim it by any other authority, than was claimed and exercised by them, and was of antient time due to the imperial crown of this realm, <HI>i. e.</HI> to have under God the sove∣reignty and rule over all persons within her dominions, of what estate soever, whether ecclesiastical or tem∣poral, so as no foreign power should have any superio∣rity over them."</P>
<P>This not serving to remove the cavils of unreasonable men, the Bishops and clergy assembled in convocation, A. D. 1562, by her consent and authority, declared still more explicitly, "That they did not by this act, or otherwise, give the Queen the ministring of God's word, or sacraments, but only that prerogative, which had been always given to all godly Princes in holy scripture by God himself, viz. that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether ecclesiastical or temporal, and restrain, with the civil sword, the stubborn and evil doers." In this sense was the oath of supremacy now enjoined to be taken, "acknowledging the Queen to be the only supreme governess of all her dominions, in all
<PB N="342" REF="371"/>ecclesiastical and temporal causes, declaring that no foreign Prince, prelate, state, or potentate, hath or ought to have any spiritual or ecclesiastical jurisdiction within this realm, renouncing all such foreign juris∣diction and authority, and promising as well to bear true allegiance to her Majesty, as to defend all juris∣dictions and authorities belonging to her, or annexed to the imperial crown of England." All prelates and ecclesiastical ministers, all judges, justices, magistrates, officers, and persons receiving fee or wages of the crown, were obliged to take this oath, on pain of being deprived of their dignities, benefices, and offices, and rendered incapable of receiving any other: and it was to be tendered to all that sued out livery of their lands, or did homage to the Queen, that took holy orders, and were admitted to degrees in the univer∣sities. The act repealing all the statutes of Queen Mary in favour either of the papacy, or of persecution for what was called heresy, and reviving all the acts of Henry VIII. against the papal power, and those of Edward VI. in behalf of the reformation, inflicted severe penalties on all that should, by writing, preach∣ing, printing, word, or deed, maintain the spiritual or ecclesiastical jurisdiction and authority of any fo∣reign prelate or potentate within the Queen's domi∣nions; the first offence to be punishable with the for∣feiture of all preferments, and goods real or personal, the second with the pains of a premunire, and the third with those of high treason. Her Majesty was likewise impowered to appoint commissioners for the exercise of her supremacy, and for correcting all errors, schisms, heresies, and enormities: but they were "re∣strained from adjudging any thing to be heresy, but what had been so determined by the authority of the canonical scriptures, by any of the four first general councils, or by some other general council, founding its declaration on the express and plain words of scrip∣ture, or what should be hereafter judged to be heresy
<PB N="343" REF="372"/>by the parliament, with the assent of the clergy in convocation." Such was the substance of this act of supremacy, which laid the foundation as well of the <HI>high commission</HI> court, which served for a bulwark of defence to the church of England against the practice and attacks of both Papists and Puritans, during the fourscore years it subsisted, as of that commission, which the Queen issued this year, for a general visita∣tion, and for correcting all disorders and irregulari∣ties, in ecclesiastical matters, which could not be re∣dressed by the ordinary episcopal power, at least with∣out taking up more time than the exigencies of the church could well allow. As to the act of uniformity, establishing the book of common prayer and admini∣stration of the sacraments, it must be observed that this book was the same in substance with that of the 5th and 6th of Edward VI. and only varied from it in two or three points, for the better promiting of a general conformity, a matter of the utmost conse∣quence to the peace of the nation and the service of religion. It was with this view that the prayer for "being delivered from the tyranny, and all the de∣testable enormities of the Bishop of Rome," was left out of the litany, left it should shock, and keep the Roman Catholics from joing in the public service; to the matter whereof they could not otherwise have any exception: and in fact, they resorted generally to the parish churches for ten years, till that famous bull of Pope Pius V. was published; as is affirmed of his own knowledge by Sir E. Coke, in his speech at Norwich assizes, and by Queen Elizabeth, in a letter, on August 11, 1570, to Sir Francis Walsing∣ham, during his embassy at Paris, and confirmed even by Saunders and Garnet. The different explications of the particular manner of Christ's presence in the eu∣charist, given in the <HI>Augsburg</HI> and <HI>Helvetic confessions,</HI> had given occasion to unhappy disputes, which had been carried to a strange height, and done great dis∣service
<PB N="344" REF="373"/>to the reformation; though the learned and moderate men on both sides found, that they agreed in the main when they came to explain their senti∣ments. To reconcile such as had a regard for those foreign churches, to the liturgy, the revisors of it added the benediction at the delivery of the sacred elements, prescribed by King Edward's first liturgy, to that which had been adopted at the instance of the Calvinisis in the second; thus taking care, whilst they rejected a carnal, that they should maintain in general such a real presence, as is asserted in the writings of the ancient fathers.</P>
<P>This last mentioned bill did not pass the Lords with∣out some struggle. Cuthbert Scot, Bishop of Chester, and John Fecknam abbot of Westminster, harangued against it: and as their speeches are the last which there will be occasion to mention on the subject, and seem to comprehend all the arguments, which the Papists could adduce in favour of this cause, we shall, with our usual impartiality, present them to our readers. Fecknam spoke as follows—As two different views were the subject of their inquiry, he looked upon it as a point of the last importance to resolve on the right side of the question: that he conceived himself bound in duty to God, the Queen, and their Lordships, to deliver his opinion upon the case; and, in order to set their Lordships upon a sure bottom, he lays down three rules to form their judgment upon. First, To distinguish the true religion from what is counterfeit, we must consider which of them has the best claim to antiquity, and has been most universally received both as to time and place. Secondly, Which of them has been most constant and uniform with itself. Thirdly, Whether of the two religions is most productive of mo∣rality and virtue: and in which communion the people are most exemplary for their piety towards God, and their obedience to the civil magistrate. In treating of the first point, the abbot pretended that the reformed
<PB N="345" REF="374"/>religion was altogether modern and novel, and never received till the latter end of Edward VI. Whereas the Roman Catholic faith and worship professed at present in this realm, had been the religion of the island for no less than fourteen hundred years. He takes it for granted, that the articles and worship of the Christian religion, when first planted here, were the same with the present belief and practice of the church of Rome; and that all parts of christendom were agreed about these matters. As to the second rule, he charges the new religion, set forth in the articles, and liturgic books of the English reformers, with in∣consistency and different appearance. He alledges, that these reformers floated in their opinion, quitted their first plan, and refined upon themselves; and yet always pretended to publish and decree nothing but the sincere word of God. He says, that it was no wonder to find such diversity in the religious system of the reformed, since the men that composed it could neither agree with each other, nor with themselves. To make out this charge, he pretends, that our English reformers took their measures, and were go∣verned in their resolutions, by the divines of Germany, such as Carolostedius, Melancthon, Luther, and Zuin∣glius. He gives an instance of their disagreement, concerning the doctrine of the holy eucharist. Carolos∣tedius interprets the words of the institution of the holy eucharist thus, <HI>accepit panem, benedixit, fregit, deditque discipulis suis, dicens, Accipite, et comedite, hoc est corpus meum quod pro vobis tradetur, monstrans corpus visibile suum.</HI> i. e. according to Carolostedius's divinity, our Saviour pointed to his visible body, and said, "This is my body which shall be betrayed for you." This exposition was condemned by Luther, who expounded the words of the institution to a sense of consubstan∣tiation. Zuinglius makes the words <HI>my body,</HI> signify no more than the figure of my body. Peter Martyr, in his late disputations at Oxford, differed from these
<PB N="346" REF="375"/>three, and would have us to understand by <HI>this is my body,</HI> that our Saviour's body received by faith, shall be <HI>pro pane, vel instar panis,</HI> i. e. instead of bread to the communicants. The abbot then proceeds to charge Archbishop Cranmer with self contradiction, and fluc∣tuating in his belief. His instance is, that in one year he published a catechism in English, and dedicated it to King Edward VI. in which he asserts the real pre∣sence of Christ's body in the eucharist; but soon after he printed another book, in which he plainly main∣tained the contrary doctrine. From hence he infers, that since both the English and German reformers are so inconsistent with themselves, their Lordships have great reason to question their belief, and refuse their scheme till they are better agreed. The abbot then comes to his third rule or characteristic of the true re∣ligion, i. e. Whether the Roman Catholic or the Re∣formed communion affords the best people, with re∣spect to piety and civil life? And here he is so hardy as to appeal to matter of fact, and desire their Lord∣ships to consider how much the subject is changed for the worse, since the death of Queen Mary: which declension in virtue he lays to the charge of the new preachers. In her late Majesty's reign (saith he) your Lordships may remember how quiet and governable the people were; it was not then their custom to prescribe to authority, to run before the laws, nor disobey the proclamations of their sovereign. There was then no sacrilegious rapine, no plundering of churches, no blasphemous outrage, and trampling the holy sacraments under their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet. In the late reign, the generality of the people, and particularly the nobility and those of the privy council, were ex∣amplary for their public devotion: it being the cus∣tom to go to a church or chapel, to beg the protec∣tion of God, before they entered upon the business of the day. But now the face of things is quite otherwise. The new preachers, and the stage, by
<PB N="347" REF="376"/>rallying and running down the old religion, have raised a turbulent humour in the people, brought on a disso∣lution of manners, and a contempt of religious appoint∣ments. From this declension in piety and good man∣ners (which he takes for granted) he solicits the Lords to expel the reformation, and adhere to the antient belief."</P>
<P>Fecknam, to remark nothing farther on his speech, misreports Cranmer and Ridley on the subject of the holy eucharist; for neither of these Bishops had contradicted their sentiments in King Edward's reign. No, they explained themselves consistently, and refuted the calumnies thrown upon them.</P>
<P>At the third reading of the bill, Cuthbert Scot, Bishop of Chester, delivered himself against it in a set speech.</P>
<P>"My Lords, this bill, though it has been thrice read, yet in my opinion it ought neither to have been mentioned nor regarded in this honourable house, the design of it being to expose those things to question, which ought to be received without farther enquiry. To speak particularly, the business of this bill is to bring on a change in religion, or more properly a total suppression of what has been antiently professed. As to religion, it consists partly in externals, and partly of things which relate to the subject, and are essential to practice. As for those matters which are more essen∣tial, they may be reduced to faith, hope, and charity; and touching the externals, the liturgy, and the ad∣ministration of the sacraments, may be ranged under this head. Now, with reference to these latter, they are clearly sunk and extinguished by this bill; and as for the former, the efficacy of them is much weakened. For, first, by breaking the unity of the church, charity is lost; for <HI>nunquam relinquent unitatem, qui non prius amittunt charitatem,</HI> i. e. "they never forsake unity, who do not first love charity." And St. Paul tells us that <HI>charity is the bond of perfectness.</HI> When charity is
<PB N="348" REF="377"/>once departed, there is nothing left to cement a Chris∣tian society: and thus we split into sects and factions, which is the calamity of the present age. As to faith, several of the articles and mysteries of this theological virtue, are not only questioned but denied. Now when faith and charity have thus taken their flight, hope must either be in a solitary condition, or (which is most likely) presumption set above it, which disorder commonly ends in despair. From what I have already observed we ought rather to pay a regard to our holy religion, than dispute upon it. For as a learned au∣thor suggests, <HI>Quaepetefacta sunt, quaerere; quaeperfecta sunt retractare; et quae definitae sunt convellere; quid aliud est quam de adeptis gratiam non referre?</HI> i. e. "To question a point clearly discovered, to touch over things which are well finished, and to unsettle matters which have passed the test, what is it but ingratitude for the blessings we have received?" And to the same purpose St. Athanasius argues; <HI>Que unnc a tot &amp; talibus episcopis probata sunt, &amp; decreta, clareque demonstrate, superva∣cuum est denuo revocare in judicium.</HI> i. e. "It is a very unnecessary business (to speak softly) to bring the cause to a rehearing, which has been thoroughly examined, and settled by so many Bishops of character." He means the Prelates that assisted at the council of Nice; for (as St Athanasius goes on) if their decisions must be re examined, this liberty is the way to keep us un∣der perpetual uncertainty, and hinder the uncertainty from ever coming to an end. Now, if St. Athanasius thought it unreasonable to question the decisions of the council of Nice, where there were but three hundred and eighteen Bishops present; how much more unac∣countable must it be in us to question the belief and practice of the whole Catholic church, where, instead of three hundred, we have three hundred thousand Bishops to vouch for authority. And as for the grounds and articles of faith, than which nothing ought to be better fixed, and more certain; these things, I say,
<PB N="349" REF="378"/>must be very precarious and floating if they hang upon an act of parliament. In earnest this is but a weak support for so great a weight. And here I desire your Lordships to understand me rightly. I have no inten∣tion to say any thing to lessen the authority of parlia∣ment. I own the acts of this honourable court are not to be contested, when passed upon matters within your jurisdiction. But as to religion, I humbly conceive that is a subject altogether foreign to the business of a par∣liament. For faith, as I have observed before, ought to have a firm basis, to be as unalterable as the laws of the Medes and Persians, and not stand liable to amend∣ments and repeals, and all other casualties of the statute book. We ought not to waver, and be at uncertainties in our belief; for as St. James speaks, <HI>he that doubts or wavers is like a wave of the sea,</HI> always rolling from one figure to another. Besides, the body of the parliament consists mostly of the temporal nobility, and the com∣mons, which, though persons of great judgment and learning in civil matters, yet divinity is none of their profession. The exposition of the scriptures, the read∣ing of the antients, has been none of their employment. These things considered, they cannot be supposed to be rightly qualified to pronounce upon the doctrines and practice of the church: neither do these things belong to their function, or lie within their character. And for this, my Lords, I appeal to a late instance. I re∣member in this parliament there was a Nobleman's son put under an arrest, and committed. This confine∣ment was resented by your Lordships, and the honour of the house was thought to suffer by it. Upon this resolution, the young gentleman, the bailiff, and the person at whose suit he was arrested, were ordered to appear before your Lordships; but before they were brought into the house, it was thought proper to de∣bate the matter over again, for fear the house might concern themselves in things <HI>without</HI> their cognizance. The case was found to contain three points. The first
<PB N="350" REF="379"/>was a debt, and that your Lordships thought proper to remit to the common law. The second point was, upon enquiry, found an encroachment upon the court of Chancery: and the third was the arrest and com∣mitment, in which the house thought themselves con∣cerned. Upon the whole, if, by your Lordships reso∣lution, the parliament has no authority to check the courts of common law, and chancery, which relate only to civil justice, and turn upon matters which lie open to human reason, then, by all force of conse∣quence, your pretensions must be still lower in matters of faith; in matters of faith and religion, which so far exceed the extent of reason. The subject of this bill being of this sublime nature, there are three things principally to be considered. First, the importance of the matter; secondly, the obscurity of the case, and the difficulty in trying the truth; and, thirdly, the danger of mistaking the point, and coming to a wrong resolution. As to the first, the importance of the matter, nothing can be greater. It is no temporal in∣terest, no money-business, no branch of property; no, it is of a much higher nature: the fate of eternity, life and death, heaven and hell, are concerned in it. For now, as the scripture says, <HI>life and death, fire and water, are set before us:</HI> now to judge rightly, in an af∣fair of this consequence, is neither every body's talent, nor every body's business. Father, we should be especially careful, not to pass a rash censure upon the judgment and practice of our forefathers. Now that system of belief, that form of religion, which is to be set aside by this bill, is the same which was professed by our ancestors for a thousand years, and upwards: and, which is more, it was likewise received by the univer∣sal church from the times of the Apostles. A noble member of this house was lately pleased to say, that our forefathers lived in the dark, and therefore we have great reason to lament their ignorance. To this we may answer, that if our forefathers were within the
<PB N="351" REF="380"/>hearing of this imputation, we have reason to be∣lieve they would reply, as our Saviour did to the wo∣men that lamented him, <HI>Weep not for us, but for your∣selves.</HI> Secondly, as the subject is of the last impor∣tance, so is the matter perplexed, and not to be dis∣intangled without difficulty and penetration. The question to be resolved relates to the mass-book, and the new common prayer. The first by the bill is to be suppressed, as unorthodox and indefeasible; the other to be established as agreeable to the holy scrip∣tures. Now, the commendation of the one, and dislike to the other, relates to the same matter, i. e. a right ad∣ministration of the sacrament, pursuant to the institu∣tion of our Saviour Christ. In which administration we are to consider three things; first, the institution of our blessed Saviour, which comprehends the matter and substance of the sacraments. Secondly, the re∣gulations of the apostles, from which the form of the sacraments may be said to emerge. To which, in the third place, we may put the additions of the holy fathers, for the perfecting, and farther advantage in the administration. These three things, as they are necessary, so they are duly observed in the mass book or old service. But the other book, which is so much magnified, not only strikes two of them clear out of practice, but makes the third almost insignificant. Notwithstanding which, the compilers pretend it ex∣actly agreeable to the word of God, our Saviour's institution, and the custom of the primitive church. But, to wave the insisting upon apostolical regulations, and primitive tradition, though these things may justly challenge our regard, let us come to the institution of our blessed Saviour, and examine which of those two books comes up closeit to his standard: and, to clear the controversy the better, we'll take the mass, or, as they call it, the Lord's supper, for an instance. And here, as all the fathers collect from the scriptures, our Saviour instituted three things. These he com∣manded
<PB N="352" REF="381"/>to be continued, in remembrance of his pas∣sion, until his coming again, <HI>Do this, &amp;c.</HI> The first is the consecration of the blessed body, and blood of our Saviour Christ: the second consists in the offer∣ing up the same to God the Father: and the third we may call the communion, i. e. the eating and drink∣ing the said blessed body and blood of our Saviour Christ, under the form of bread and wine. These two things are taken away in the new service-book, which the compilers of that book are willing to ac∣knowledge. They declaim against the doctrine of Christ's being offered oftener than once, though the holy fathers unanimously maintain, that Christ is still offered in an unbloody manner. Now, if these men would consider the consequences of their tenets, this reflection might be serviceable to recover them. For if there is no external sacrifice, then there is no priest∣hood; for the function of a priest (as St. Paul informs us) is to offer gifts and sacrifices for sin. Now if there is no priesthood under the New Testament, the next inference is that we have no religion: and thus "we are without God in the world." For these, like the links of a chain, have a close con∣nexion with one another. Farther, I desire your Lord∣ships to consider, that the consecration falls likewise in this modern liturgy. These men talk of nothing but the holy communion, but fall short of the mean∣ing of that expression, for the things which should make it holy, i. e. the body and blood of Christ, are not there. It is true, when the administration is duly performed, the communion may well be called holy: for then we receive our blessed Saviour's body and blood into our bodies; and thus we are united with him, like two pieces of wax, which are melted into each other. This similitude St. Cyril and St. Chry∣softom made use of upon this occasion; and, as St. Paul speaks, "We are made flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone." But this great advantage cannot
<PB N="353" REF="382"/>be expected from the new book; for by the ministra∣tion prescribed, Christ's body is not truly there; for when there is no consecration, there can be no real presence. But this is the case of the new service; for these men neither observe the form prescribed by Christ, nor the custom of the church. The Evange∣list informs us, that our Saviour took "bread, bles∣sed, broke, and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take and eat, this is my body, do this in remembrance of me." By these words, we are commanded to take the broad in our hands, to bless, and break it; but by the orders of, this book, all this is omitted; for the priest neither takes the bread in his hand, nor blesses it, nor breaks it. And as for the words, <HI>this is my body,</HI> by the pronouncing of which has St. Chrysostom teaches) the consecration is performed, their priests, when they pronounce these words of our Saviour, have no regard to the sacramental solemnity, or the force of the expression, or the effect upon the bread; but make no more of the words than if they were telling a story. To proceed, the Doctors of the church affirm, that an intention to do that which Christ did, i. e. "To consecrate his body and blood," is a circumstance of absolute necessity. For this pur∣pose, the church has appointed certain prayers in the canon of the mass, to be said before the consecration: the words are these, <HI>Ut fiat nobis corpus et sanguis Do∣mini nostri, Jesu Christi,</HI>" i. e. that the elements may be made unto us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thus the intention of the church, and of the priest officiating, is plainly declared. But in this new book there is neither any such intention de∣clared, or any petition put up to God for that pur∣pose. The contrary does rather appear by these words in their office; "That we receiving these thy creatures of bread and wine, may, &amp;c. Which words declare they intend nothing of consecration. And if so, let them value themselves as much as they please upon
<PB N="354" REF="383"/>their communion, it is to no manner of purpose, in regard the body of Christ is not there; which, as I have already observed, is the very thing that should be communicated. Yesterday a noble peer was pleased to say, that he believed Christ was received in the communion prescribed by the new service: but upon his being asked, whether he worshipped him there, he answered, No, nor ever intended it. Now this is a strange opinion, that Christ should not be worshipped where-ever he is owned to be present. I grant they tell us they worship our Saviour no less than we do: but then they distinguish, and affirm it is with respect to his being in heaven, and not as he is present in the sa∣crament; which is just as if a man should say, that he is willing to pay a civil worship to his Prince, when he sits under a state, and has his robes on: but if he comes abroad under a disguise, or in a plain habit, they desire to be excused. And yet, by their favour, he is as much a Sovereign in a freeze coat in the streets, as when he sits upon the throne in gold tissue. And thus he that sits upon the throne in gold tissue. And thus he that sit upon the right hand of God, in the appearance of a glorified body, is the same Christ which is concealed in the sacrament, under the forms of bread and wine. The scriptures (as St. Austin ex∣pounds it) command us to worship our Saviour's body in the sacrament. The text runs thus, <HI>Adorate scabellum ejus,</HI> &amp;c. i. e. Worship his footstool, for it is holy. And now, my Lords, I beg you would please to consider the subject of the present controversy, and whether your Lordships are sufficiently qualified to examine the points, and pronounce upon the case, i. e. Whether your Lordships are furnished so far with ec∣clesiastical learning, as to give a judgment whether the body of Christ is <HI>consecrated, offered, adored,</HI> and truly <HI>communicated</HI> by the order of this new book? whether these acts and circumstances are made essen¦tial by the institution of our Saviour, and whether this <HI>new book</HI> follows the direction of that infallible rule?
<PB N="355" REF="384"/>These things, as I observed to your Lordships, are weighty and perplexed; and it is no easy matter not to fall into an error. And then your Lordships may likewise consider the condition of the other sacraments; and that these are either perfectly sunk, or mangled after the same manner by this book. Thirdly, Your Lordships may please to remember the great danger you draw upon yourselves, by undertaking to judge in the cause, especially if you should happen to make a wrong decision; for then, besides the misfortune of your own persons, you will prove the unhappy occa∣sion of misleading others. King Jeroboam has this mark set upon him, as an aggravation of his misbe∣haviour, that, besides his personal miscarriage, "he made Israel to sin." My Lords, I intreat you would be very careful to prevent the application of this text. To speak freely, in my judgment, if you pass this bill, you will not only err yourselves, but be instru∣mental in misleading the nation, for which you must expect to give an account to Almighty God. Those who are well read in ecclesiastical history, and ac∣quainted with the methods of the church, in debating religious controversy, can easily inform your Lord∣ships, that these matters have been all along decided by the clergy, and not by the laity. The Arian heresy, in the reign of Constantine the Great, was canvassed and condemned in the council of Nice; the heresy of Macedonius, in the first council of Constantinople, in the time of Theodosius the Great; the heresy of Nestorius, in that of Ephesus, in the reign of Theo∣dosius the Younger; the heresy of Eutyches, in the council of Chalcedon, under Mercian. But here we are to observe, that none of those religious Emperors ever convened their temporal nobility, or commons, to advise, or determine in these controversies. They did not refer the case to the majority of the laity, nor go to the poll to discover truth. And to come nearer home, to the third council of Toledo in Spain, and to
<PB N="356" REF="385"/>a French council, in the reign of Charles the Great; in both these, the customary usage of the church was observed. The Prelates had the Pope's leave to meet, and then reformed the abuses, and decided the matters in ques∣tion. And the Princes brought none of the laity to intermeddle in the affair: neither did they themselves offer to debate the matter, but left the controversies entirely to the management of the clergy: nor need we wonder at this conduct in Catholic Princes, for even heretical Emperors declined bringing the laity to interpose in religious disputes. Thus Constantius and Valens, who drew several synods together, left the de∣cision to the body of the clergy. And the Emperor Zeno, who was a favourer of Eutyches, managed by the same rule. Nay, in the acts of the Apostles, the Infidels refused to concern themselves this way: for when St. Paul was brought before Gallio, and charged with teaching the people to worship God contrary to the laws of the country, this Magistrate replied, "If it were any manner of wickedness, O ye Jews, I might well bear with you: but if it be concerning any ques∣tions or doubts in the law," i. e. if it be a charge con∣cerning your religion, "I will be no judge in these matters." I beseech your Lordships to recollect that all Princes and Magistrates, Catholic, Heretic, and Infidel, have all along refused to put themselves in a post, which your Lordships are now going to challenge. But I shall distress your Lordships patience no longer, and conclude with the mention of two instances. The first is in the Emperor Theodosius the Great, who makes no scruple to confess, that, <HI>Illicitum est qui non sit ex ordine sanctorum episcoporum, ecclesiasticis se immis∣cere tractatibus.</HI> i. e. "It is not lawful for a man who has not the episcopal character, to interpose in religious affiars." The other is a saying of the Emperor Va∣lentinian; <HI>Mihi quidem qui in sorte plelis sum, fas non est ista curiosus scrutari: Sacerdotes quibus isla curae sunt, inter seipsos, quocunque loco voluerint, conveniant:</HI> i. e.
<PB N="357" REF="386"/>"It is not lawful for me, saith the Emperor, who am but a layman, to enter into any curious enquiry upon these matters: this is the Bishops business, and there∣fore let them meet about it where they please." Now if these Emperors had nothing to do in such debates, I must crave leave to say your Lordships have as little.</P>
<P>And thus the Bishop concludes his speech, desiring their Lordships to consider what was offered, and in∣terpret him favourably.</P>
<P>Most readers may be judicious enough to disintan∣gle the matter; it being no difficult matter to show the principles laid down, the authorities produced, and the consequences drawn, will not bear in the application. The advantage gained by the reformed, at the confe∣rence in Westminster abbey<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 329 of this volume.</NOTE>, smoothed the passage for the uniformity-bill, and brought over a majority of the houses; and thus the artful and elaborate rhe∣toric of Scot and Fecknam were disappointed. The reason why we have no answers to these speeches is, because there were no reformed Bishops then sitting in the upper house: for the controversy was too much embarrassed with ecclesiastical learning, to be managed by the temporal nobility. When the bill passed, the Archbishop of York, the Bishops of Ely, London, Worcester, Landaff, Coventry, Litchfield, Exeter, Chester, and Carlisle, the Marquis of Winchester, the Earl of Shrewsbury, the Viscount Montague, and the Lords Morley, Stafford, Dudley, Wharton, Rich, and North, dissented. The parliament approved of the new revised draught of the liturgy, excepting in one circumstance. The committee of divines had left the people at liberty to receive the communion, either kneeling or standing; which the parliament restrained to kneeling, agreeable to the first service book of King Edward. The penalty for depraving the common prayer, for the third offence, is the forfeiture of all the criminal's goods and chattels, and imprisonment
<PB N="358" REF="387"/>during life. This clause did not pass without a guard for the honour and privileges of the Lords: for it is expressly provided, <HI>that all and singular Lords of parlia∣ment</HI> shall be tried by their peers. And thus, in the late reign, it was enacted, that all Lords of parlia∣ment, having place and voice in parliament, are to be tried by their peers, in case of petit treasons, murder, and felony. Sir Edward Coke makes no scruple to affirm, that the Bishops are Lords of parliament. His reasons are undeniable. "They hold of the King, says he, by barony, and are called by writ to parlia∣ment." From hence it follows, that, by the statutes of Queen Mary and Elizabeth, the Bishops have a right to be tried by their Peers, no less than the temporal nobility.</P>
<P>During this sessions a peace was concluded at Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eau in the Cambresis, with the French and Scots. By the French treaty, Calais, and its dependences, were to be restored to the Queen, after the term of eight years The parliament was dissolved on May 28, and the Sunday afterwards the common prayer was used in the Queen's own chapel; as it was, at Mid∣summer, in all parish-churches throughout the kingdom: the people having been used to it in King Edward's time, it was received with great joy in all places. As Elizabeth had no great reason to expect the peace would be o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>long continuance, and as she had proposed to employ the leisure it afforded her to promote a refor∣mation, she resolved to lose no time in establishing an uniformity in religious worship. In Edward's time nothing had been a greater obstruction to the progress of the reformation, than the compliance of several Popish Bishops, after they had opposed in parliament all the bills that passed in its favour: skreened by their own conformity, they encouraged non-conformity in the clergy and people of their dioceses, and either con∣nived at, or protected, such as disobeyed the King's injunctions. There had been in that reign a majority
<PB N="359" REF="388"/>of Bishops, with the two Archbishops at their head, well affected to the reformation, and zealous to pro∣mote it; so that the Prelates, attached to the Papacy, had no way to take for keeping up in the nation any regard for the see of Rome, and the superstitions and novelties it had introduced into religious worship, so likely to succeed, as by retaining their sees, and em∣ploying their episcopal authority to protect such of the clergy as mangled the liturgy, instilled prejudices a∣gainst it into the people, and otherwise served the cause of Popery. But now, having found themselves una∣nimous in their parliamentary measures, they vainly imagined that, holding altogether, they could put a stop at once to the reformation: and, perhaps, being ashamed of so many shiftings and changes, they resol∣ved not to comply any more, nor take the oath of su∣premacy, which they had so often taken, either as Bishops or priests, in the reigns of the late Kings, Henry and Edward. The most eminent for learning and merit among the reformed clergy had, in Queen Mary's time, been either martyred for their religion, or had disappeared, living either in exile abroad, or so privately at home in lurking holes (where they applied themselves entirely to their studies) that they could not be discovered: and this encouraging many of the in∣ferior Popish clergy to think themselves necessary, and that the churches could not be supplied without their ministration, they took up likewise the resolution of standing out, and of quitting their preferments; a conduct which several of them are said to repent of, when they found themselves disappointed in their ex∣pectation. The Queen, who, out of a desire to have every thing done according to law, had hitherto borne the contradictions of the Bishops, resolved now to pro∣ceed roundly against them: and they were all summon∣ed to appear, on May 15, before the council; when, putting them in mind of the late acts for restoring re∣ligion and the supremacy of the crown, she recom∣mended
<PB N="360" REF="389"/>the affairs of the church to their consideration, and pressed them to suppress all the Romish superstitions. Heath, Archbishop of York, answering in the name of the rest, desired her to recollect her sister's attach∣ment to the see of Rome, and her engagement with the Pope, which, he thought, bound her successors: and exhorted her to reunite with the Papacy. She told them that her sister had no power to bind her successors to an usurped authority; that, her crown being inde∣pendent, she owned no superior on earth; that the Pope's usurpation over Princes was insupportable; and that she should look upon all her subjects, whether ec∣clesiastical or civil, as enemies to God and the crown, who should abet his pretensions, or own any foreign power whatsoever.</P>
<P>A discovery had been lately made of the unlawful correspondence which Heath and most of these Bishops had held with Rome in King Edward's time; their plots for cutting off the Protector, with the wisest of the council, and for strengthening the interest of the Pope and the Romish religion; to which the late Queen Mary was supposed to have been privy. This appear∣ed by several letters and papers found in her closet, and sealed up at the time of her decease, by the Earl of Sussex, to whose custody they had been committed. It was proposed, at first, to prosecute the Bishops for these treasonable practices: but the Queen's pardons, at her coronation, and the conclusion of the late par∣liament, extending to all crimes perpetrated before her accession, the council thought it most adviseable to tender them the oath of supremacy. There were about fourteen of them; and all refused the oath, except Kitchin Bishop of Landaff. The others were, Heath of York, Bonner of London, White of Winchester, Tonstal of Durham, Thirlby of Ely, Watson of Lin∣coln, Pose of Peterborough, Bourne of Wells, Tuber∣ville of Exeter, Bayne of Litchfield, Morgan of St. David's, Oglethorpe of Carlisle, Pate of Worcester,
<PB N="361" REF="390"/>Scot of Chester, and Goldwell, who had been transla∣ted by the Pope from St. Asaph to Oxford, but had not taken possession of this last see by reason of Queen Mary's decease. The three last of these chose to quit the kingdom; the rest, whose sees were vacant in law upon refusal of the oath, were deprived, one after an∣other, in June, July August, and September: and, notwithstanding the barbarous usage of the reformed Bishops in the late reign, were treated with great hu∣manity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oglethorpe died soon after of an apoplexy, Bayne of the stone, and Morgan of some other distemper, in the December following; all of them in their beds, and at full liberty Heath and Pole lived on their own estates, and died at last, as White and Tuberville did, at liberty. Tonstal and Thirlby were well entertained, till their deaths, at Lambeth, by Archbishop Parker; as Bourne was by Dr. Carew Dean of Exeter. When any of them transgressed the laws, and preached in their pontifical habits, they got off with a short con∣finement, and gentle reprimand, upon promising not to offend for the future. Bonner alone was confined to the Marshalsea upon this occasion, not so much for his inhumanity in putting so many to death in the late reign, as to preserve him from the revenge of their relations, and the fury of the populace, who held him in the utmost detesta∣tion; for he had the liberty (though he durst not use i) of going abroad. Watson, a sour morose man, lived twenty-four years after his deprivation, with the Bishops of Rochester or Ely: but then embarking in measures with the Jesuits, and other Romish emissaries, that came over on treasonable designs into England, he was sent prisoner to the castle of W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sbech in Cambridgeshire, where he died. The oath was next tende<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to the dig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aries and parochial clergy; and of these there were twelve Deans, as many Archdeacon, fifteen heads of colleges, fifty prebendaries of cathedral churches, about eighty incumbents of parishes, that refused it, and lost their prefer∣ments on that account; the whole num<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, including the Bishops, not amounting to two hundred, which▪ in a realm containing twenty-six dioceses, and near ten thousand parishes, was very inconsiderable.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About this time John Jewel, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury, wrote to Zurich, and gave Bullinger an ac∣count of the state of religion in England.

That the reformed in England had not only their old antagonists, but their late friends to en∣counter with: that these latter had deserted the cause, joined the enemy, and made a more vigorous and ob∣stinate resistance than any of the rest; and which gives us, says he, the most trouble, we have the re∣mainder of the Spanish vices, luxury, pride, and liber∣tinism, to contest with: as yet our fortunes are unre∣stored, and we are little the better for returning to our country. He proceeds, we hope our affairs will mend shortly; for the Queen is a prudent and religious Princess, and inclined to favour us: religion is re∣covered to the same foot on which it stood in the reign of King Edward VI. and I am satisfied the letters sent hither by yourself, and your republic, had a con∣siderable weight in this matter. He affirms, that the Queen will not endure the stile of Head of the church of England; that she is altogether of opinion that title is too big for any mortal, and ought to be given to none but our blessed Saviour: and besides, it has been so horribly abused by the Pope, that it is scarcely con∣sistent with a good conscience for any person to make use of it. He further advances, our universities are in a lamentable condition, and almost quite lost to all sense of orthodoxy; there are not above two in Oxford of our sentiment; and those so far dispirited as to be good for nothing. As to friar Soto, and another Spanish monk, he says, they have quite destroyed Peter Martyr's plantation, and made a wilderness of the Lord's vineyard. In the latter part he affirms, you can scarcely imagine so great a ravage and desolation of principles could have happened in so short a time: and tho' I should be glad to see any thing from Zurich in England, yet I would not advise you to send any young travellers hither at present, unless you would have them come home with less learning, and a worse belief."</P>
<PB N="363" REF="394"/>
<P>Soon after the dissolution of the parliament, there was a consultation at Greenwich, whether it was ad∣viseable for the Queen to admit Martineg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Pope's nuncio; which was carried in the negative. The reasons alledged were, that, by the statutes of the realm, no person, with a public character from Rome, was permitted to come into the kingdom: that, at the present juncture, it would be dangerous to entertain an agent from his holiness: and that the countenance of a nuncio would encourage the malecontents, and hinder their compliance with the late establishment. The Pope had been all along advertised of the progress of the reformation. When Elizabeth first came to the crown, he was extravagantly haughty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 316 of this volume.</NOTE>. Thus he continued impolitically stiff, and untractable, till things were past remedy. At last, perceiving his gasconades had no effect, he grew more moderate in his demands, dropped his civil sovereignty, and only insisted there might be no innovations in religion. Sir Edward Karne, the Queen's ambassador, told him, that he had no instructions to answer upon that head: and that the way for his holiness to obtain satisfaction was to de∣clare for the lawfulness of the marriage. This was a shocking request to the Pope and Conclave, and could not be complied with, without putting a disgrace upon the former proceedings of that court. They chose rather to risque the event, than run upon that rock: and when, by farther advices from England, the pontiff understood that a revolution in the church was coming forward, he commanded Karne not to depart Rome without leave; and in the mean time to take the government of the English hospital there. The Pope's aim, in putting this restraint upon Karne, was to pre∣vent his giving intelligence of the practices carried on by the French and the court of Rome against the Queen. But Karne had sent some advices of this
<PB N="364" REF="395"/>intrigue already: and the design was quickly no se∣cret, nor needed any agent to discover it. Mary Queen of Scots, swayed by the ambition of the Dau∣phin her husband, the Pope's incitement, and the ad∣vice of the French King, put up a claim to the British sovereignty: founding her right upon descent, as heir to the late Queen Mary. These pretensions could not be supported, without throwing a blemish upon Queen Elizabeth's birth, and plainly declaring her illegitimate. This was a severe provocation, and gave the Queen a lasting aversion to that Princess.</P>
<P>Thus alarmed with a competition, the Queen provided for her defence,<NOTE PLACE="inter">The Queen's injunctions.</NOTE> and went on with greater vigour in the reformation. For this end a body of injunctions was set forth; im∣porting much the same as those of King Edward. The new regulations were, first, concerning the use of singing, which the Queen would have kept up to pre∣serve the science and advantages of music: that there∣fore all maintenance settled for the service of the choirs should be continued. There was likewise care taken that an affectation of skill should not be carried so far, as to make the use of the church-service less significant; and that they should sing in so plain and distinct a manner, that the pronunciation should be altogether as well understood, as if it had been read. However, for the satisfaction of those that were par∣ticularly fond of music, a religious anthem was al∣lowed at the beginning and end of the service. Pur∣suant to this order, the psalms were sung in plain song, in most parish-churches; and, in the Queen's chapel, in cathedrals, and colleges, the hymns were sung in a more awakening and improved manner. To make the performance farther entertaining and solemn, organs and other instrumental music were made use of. The customary reverences in churches were ordered to be continued; for instance, when the name of Jesus was pronounced, all persons were to bow, or shew some
<PB N="365" REF="396"/>other suitable mark of respect. Altars were not to be taken down, but by direction of the parson or church-wardens, and in that case the communion-table was to stand in place of the altar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The oath of supremacy having been misconstrued by several persons, as if the Kings or Queens of this realm had challenged "an authority and power of ministry of divine service in the church," the Queen disclaims the supremacy in this sense, and that her Ma∣jesty neither does, nor ever will challenge such authority. She also declared that she intended to stretch the <HI>regale</HI> no farther than it was carried by Henry VIII. and by Edward VI. "and was of ancient time due to the imperial crown of this realm." How far this reached, the <HI>admonition</HI> proceeds to explain; that is, "Under God to have the sovereignty and rule over all manner of persons born within these realms, dominions, and country, either ecclesiastical or temporal, so as no foreign power ought to have any superiority over them." The Queen professed herself willing to accept the oath of supremacy sworn in this sense.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About Midsummer the Queen issued commissions for a royal visitation all over England, by commis∣sioners assigned for different circuits. They proceeded upon the plan of the injunctions; and had besides a book of articles printed for that purpose. By these directions all carved images, paintings, counterfeit miracles, and other superstitious remains, were re∣moved out of the churches, and defaced<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The discovery of a late imposterious practice the more induced the Queen to give way to the removal of images. At the arrival of the Earl of Sussex, the Queen's Lieutenant, in Ireland, the litany was sung in English at Christ church, Dublin. Some bigotted Papists were much offended, and endeavoured to retrieve their old service by counterfeiting a miracle. For this purpose, a marble figure of our Saviour, standing in the cathedral, with a reed in his hand, and a crown of thorns upon his head, was observed to bleed through the thorns upon the face of the crucifix. This wonder∣ful appearance happened in service-time, when the Lord Lieute∣nant, the Archbishop, and the rest of the privy council, were at church. When this was perceived by the people, they were strangely affected, especially when one privy to the contrivance told them, "that our Saviour could not chuse but sweat blood, when heresy was come into the church." All the audience not be∣ing of the same mind, the miracle occasioned a confusion, and the congregation broke up. Several of the people, however, staid be∣hind, fell on their knees, and prayed before the image. The Archbishop of Dublin, suspecting some foul play. ordered the Sex∣ton to wash and examine the image; in doing which, the man per∣ceived a spunge soaked with blood in the hollow of the head. One Lee, formerly a monk of the cathedral, had that very Sunday morning placed within the head the spunge, which being loaded with blood, it was strained through the cracks of the marble, and fell down in drops upon the face. The cheat being thus discover∣ed, the Archbishop preached in the church upon that subject the next Sunday: and, to make the more serviceable impression, Lee with his accomplices were planted upon a table before the pulpit, with their hands and legs tied, and their crime written on a paper fixed to their breasts. In this manner they appeared three Sundays, were imprisoned for some time, and then banished the realm. A detail of this imposture was transmitted by Archbishop Curwin; which being presented to the Queen by Parker, gave a turn to her inclination, and prevailed with her to consent to the removal of images: but all that divine's a learning and zeal could not persuade the Queen to part with the crucifix, and lighted tapers, in her own closet. She thought, probably, that the arguing against the use, from the abuse, was short of exact reasoning. <HI>See an account of-another imposture of much the same nature, called</HI> the rood of grace, <HI>page</HI> 471 <HI>of vol.</HI> ii. <HI>of this work.</HI></NOTE>. They in∣quired
<PB N="366" REF="397"/>likewise into the preaching, morals, and ma∣nagement of the clergy. However, the ignorant zeal of some people carried them too far in this exercise; for not only images were destroyed, but copes, altar∣carpets, prayer-books, other church-furniture, and crucifixes, were burnt together. The Queen and court did not countenance this furious zeal: and the reader may see an ample dissertation on images, &amp;c. in church∣es, page 77 of this volume.</P>
<P>The case of the Popish Bishops lately turned out was not neglected abroad. The Emperor, and other Roman Catholic Princes, solicited the Queen to deal favourably with them, and to allow the Papists some churches in cities and large towns; but without effect, as such an indulgence would be contrary to the public interest, and would encourage faction and an unrea∣sonable separation.</P>
<P>Though many sees were vacant at the time of her
<PB N="367" REF="398"/>accession, the Queen took no steps for filling them till July,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Consecration of Arch∣bishop Parker, and o∣ther Prelates.</NOTE> when <HI>congres d'élire</HI> were issued to the chap∣ters of several for the election of Bishops. Dr. Matthew Parker was accordingly, on August 1, chosen Archbishop of Canterbury, as Wil∣liam Barlow and John Scory, formerly Bishops of Wells and Chichester<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 177, 194, and 330, of this volume.</NOTE>, were, about the same time, presented to the sees of Chichester and Hereford: and these two Prelates officiated, on the 8th and 9th of the following month, at the solemn service in the cathe∣dral of St. Paul, for celebrating the obsequies of Hen∣ry II. late King of France; which was done with all the magnificence imaginable (the French ambassador and hostages assisting at the solemnity, by order from their court), a thing which contributed highly to her reputation in foreign countries. The Queen, who had made every thing subservient to her interest, had, on the Christmas-eve before, caused the like obsequy to be celebrated in honour of the Emperor Charles V. but that had been performed by the Popish Bishops af∣ter the Roman manner; whereas the grosser supersti∣tions of Popery were omitted, and the communion re∣ceived on this occasion. Parker was consecrated at Lambeth on Sunday, December 17, by Barlow and Scory, Bishops elect of Chichester and Hereford, Miles Coverdale, late Bishop of Exeter, and John Hodskins, suffragan Bishop of Bedford, according to the ordinal of Edward VI. newly reprinted for that purpose<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Roman Catholics, because the Primate, after his conse∣cration, gave an entertainment at the Nag's-Head tavern in Cheap∣side, have affected to ridicule his ordination as irregular, and brand it with the appellation of <HI>the Nag's-Head consecration:</HI> but a full disproof of this calumny may be seen in that Prelate's register, in which every thing relating to his consecration is entered at large; and that ludicrous piece, called Ward's <HI>History of the Reformation,</HI> is only proper to mislead the ignorant, and is neither believed nor deemed of sufficient authority or authenticity by the sensible Papists, one of whom (father Courayer) has published an irrefragable vin∣dication of the validity of the consecration in the church of Eng∣land.</NOTE>.
<PB N="368" REF="399"/>The sees of London, Ely, Worcester, and Bangor, were filled by Edmund Grindal, Richard Cox, Edwyn Sandys, and Rowland Meyrick, all consecrated before the end of that month; as Thomas Young, Nicholas Bullingham, John Jewel, Richard Davis, and Ed∣mund Guest, were, in the next month, for the bi∣shoprics of St. David's, Lincoln, Sarum, St. Asaph, and Rochester. Those of Bath and Wells, Litchfield, Exeter, Norwich, Peterborough, Winton, and Glou∣cester, were filled, in different months of this year, by Gilbert Berkley, Thomas Bentham, William Alley, John Parkhurst, Edmund Scambler, Robert Horne, and Richard Chaney, all men of abilities in point of learning, and eminent for the integrity of their lives and conversation. Thus were all the sees in the pro∣vince of Canterbury supplied with pastors, except Bris∣tol, which was held <HI>in commendam</HI> with Gloucester, till A.

D 1603, the jurisdiction being exercised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the revenues enjoyed by favourite courtiers. The archiepiscopal see of York, and the bishoprics in that province, viz. Dur∣ham, Carlisle, and Chester, were not filled till A. D. 1561, by Thomas Young, James Pilkington, John Best, and William Downham.</P>
<P>The settlement of the reformation in England en∣couraged some of John à Lasco's congregation to return hither<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See pages 126 and 193 of this volume.</NOTE>, and petition for their church, in Austin Friers, granted them by King Edward VI. Utenhovius, a man of learning and condition, who had formerly been
<PB N="369" REF="400"/>a member of this congregation, came over with recom∣mendatory letters from Bullinger to the Queen. This Utenhovius, with one Peter de Loene, a minister, joined themselves at first to one Adrian Hampste∣dius's congregation. The granting him a new patent, with the old privileges, was at first refused; the Bi∣shops having suggested to the Queen, that making a foreigner a superintendant could not be done without maiming the jurisdiction of the diocesian. To take off this objection, they chose Grindal Bishop of London for their superintendant. The French Protestants, though formerly incorporated with the Low Dutch and Germans in King Edward's patent, made no at∣tempt to recover their former privileges. However, they had the use of a church in Threadneedle-street, belonging to the Dean and Chapter of Windsor. It was part of St. Anthony's hospital, and still continues for the use of that nation.</P>
<P>Bishop Jewel preached a sermon on March 30 this year, in Lent, at Paul's cross, upon these words of the apostle St. Paul; "for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 23.</NOTE>." From this text he took occasion to make that remarkable chal∣lenge in defence of the reformation. The Papists ha∣ving charged the church of England with novelty, and departing from primitive doctrine and practice, to wipe off these aspersions, the Bishop put the cause up∣on a bold issue, and declared in the pulpit, that "if any learned men of all our adversaries, or if all the learned men that are alive, are able to bring one suffi∣cient sentence out of any old Catholic Doctor or Fa∣ther, or out of any old general council, or out of any of the holy scriptures of God, or any one example of the primitive church, whereby it may be clearly and plainly proved, that, for the first six hundred years af∣ter Christ, there was any private mass in the world;
<PB N="370" REF="401"/>or that there was then any communion administered in one kind; or that the people had their communion in a language which they did not understand; or that the Bishop of Rome was then called universal Bishop, or head of the universal church; or that the people were then taught to believe, that Christ's body is really, substantially, corporally, carnally, or naturally in the sacrament; or that his body is, or may be, in a thou∣sand places, or more, at one time; or that the priest did then hold up the sacrament over his head; or that the people did then fall down and worship it with di∣vine honour; or that the sacrament was then, or now ought to be, fixed, depending under a canopy; or that in the sacrament, after the words of consecration, there remains only the accidents and appearances, without the substance, of bread and wine; or that the priest then divided the sacrament in three parts, and afterwards received himself alone; or that whosoever had affirmed the sacrament a figure, a pledge, a token, or a remembrance of Christ's body, had been con∣demned for a heretic; or that it was then lawful to have thirty, twenty, fifteen, ten, or five masses to be said in a church in one day; or that images were then set up in churches for people to worship them; or that the laity were then forbid to read the scriptures in the language of the country; or that it was then lawful for the priest to pronounce the words of consecration so low, as to be heard by none but himself; or that the priest had then authority to offer up Christ to his fa∣ther; or to communicate and receive the sacrament for another, as they do; or to apply the virtue of Christ's death and passion to any man by the means of the mass; or that it was then thought sound doctrine to affirm, that the mass <HI>ex opere operato,</HI> that is, by the bare force of the administration, and without re∣gard to the qualifications of the person receiving, is able to discharge any part of our sins; or that then any Christian called the sacrament his Lord and his God;
<PB N="371" REF="402"/>or that the people were then taught to believe, that the body of Christ remains in the sacrament, as long as the accidents of the bread continue without corrup∣tion; or that when Christ said, <HI>this is my body,</HI> the word <HI>this</HI> does not refer to the bread, but to an <HI>indi∣viduum vagum,</HI> as some of them say; or that the acci∣dents or appearances of bread and wine are the sacra∣ments of Christ's body and blood, and not rather the very bread and wine itself; or that the sacrament is a sign of the body of Christ that lies hidden under it; or that ignorance is the mother of true devotion; that if any of his adversaries were able to make out but a sin∣gle proposition amongst all these, either by sufficient declarations in scripture, or by the testimony of the an∣cient fathers and councils, he was ready to give up the contest, and subscribe himself a proselyte."</P>
<P>This challenge made a great noise, and the Papists thought themselves obliged to answer it. Dr. Cole, late Dean of St. Paul's, was the first who undertook the contest: his manner was smooth and friendly, and some letters past between him and the Bishop. Rastall entered the lists, and engaged with more heat, but with as little success. These were seconded by Dormer and Marshal. Dr. John Harding, an English divine, who retired to Louvain, was the most considerable ad∣versary. He had been a strong Protestant in the reign of King Edward, but relapsed to Popery when Queen Mary came to the crown. He offered at a thorough answer, and considered the challenge from point to point: but his testimonies did not reach up to the age for which they were cited. He makes use of counter∣feit records, and cites the decretal epistles, as if they were written by the Popes whose names they carry. The Bishop first published an answer, and afterwards a rejoinder to Harding's performances. Which of these two learned men were the fairest representers, came closest up to the difficulties, and argued with the greatest
<PB N="372" REF="403"/>learning and force, may be easily discovered, by perusing what passed between them.</P>
<P>Paul IV. dying, the see of Rome, after a vacancy of four months, was filled with John Angelo Cardi∣nal of Medicis, who took the name of Pius IV. This Pope appeared not of so haughty and imperious a tem∣per as his predecessor: he wisely considered, that pro∣ceeding to extremities, without a proportionable power, was a dangerous experiment: that violent measures had been often unsuccessful; and that several kingdoms had been lost by unseasonable stiffness and rigour. By this rough treatment, for instance, England went off from Clement VII. and, when it was afterwards recovered, the imperious demands of the late Pope had so disgust∣ed Queen Elizabeth, that she immediately gave in to the reformation. However, this Pope did not despair of gaining her by smooth applications; to which pur∣pose he dispatched Parpalia, Abbot of St. Saviour's, with a letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter, from Cambden, is as follows: Dearest daughter in Christ, health and apostolic benediction. How much the salvation of your soul, the honour of your reign, and the interest of your king∣dom, is desired by us, is known to God the searcher of hearts; and may be understood, in some measure, by the instructions which our Nuncio Vincentio Parpalia, a person of fidelity, and not unknown to your Majesty, has orders to lay before you. We earnestly ex∣hort your Highness, dearest daughter, that you would be no longer governed by unhappy advisers; by men who love nothing but their own interests and pleasures: we therefore intreat you to give the fear of God the principal sway in your councils, <HI>to know the time of your visitation,</HI> and to resign to the admonitions of us your spiritual father. Your Majestly may promise yourself any reasonable length of com∣pliance, which lies within the compass of my station, not only with reference to your spiritual advantage, but likewise for the service and security of your royal dignity. And that, when you return to the communion of the church, as we hope you will, you shall be received with the same marks of affection and regard, as the father entertain∣ed his son with at the coming home: though our satisfaction will be much greater than that mentioned in the parable; for there the joy was only for the recovery of a single person, whereas your Hihgness's return will draw your subjects happiness along with you, and give a strong occasion of pleasure to the universal church. And besides, Heaven itself will be, as it were, transported with the news, and you will make an addition to the joys of the blessed. Such a glori∣ous recollection will raise your character, prove serviceable to your memory, and give you a much b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighter crown than that you now wear. But, concerning this affair, my Agent Vincentio shall dis∣course with your Highness more at large, and give you farther proof of our paternal affection, &amp;c.

<P>About this time, a form of belief, digested into eleven articles, was set forth by the Bishops,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Articles to be owned by the clergy.</NOTE> and ordered to be read by the clergy at their first entering upon their cures. The second article declares, that all errors and heresies may be sufficiently confuted by scripture. The fifth affirms the Queen's superiority and prerogative in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as temporal, to be a∣greeable to the word of God, and rightfully belonging to her Highness, in the same sense and extent, as it is declared in the late act of parliament, and explained in her Majesty's injunctions. The eighth affirms, that the difuse of <HI>exorcism,</HI> oil, salt, spittle, or hallowing of the water in the administration of baptism, is no exception∣able omission: because these ceremonies are no part of the substance of the sacrament. The last disallows the usual flourishing upon images, relicks, and counterfeit miracles. And all representations of the invisible God in the figure of an old man, or of the Holy Ghost in that of a dove, and all other modes of divine worship unwarranted by scripture, such as pilgrimages, setting up candles, and praying upon beads, are directly cen∣sured.</P>
<P>Elizabeth gloried in the reformation she had establish∣ed, and the foreign world stood amaz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at her having done it with such apparent facility, and without the least disturbance: she loved the decorum, and even splendor of religion, and did not care that the exterior face of the church of England should appear mean and
<PB N="374" REF="405"/>fordid in the eyes of foreigners, who already admired the wisdom, vigour, and dignity of her administration. This year, the English translation of the scriptures, commonly called the Geneva Bible, was published at Geneva. There are two epistles prefixed to the work, one to the Queen, and another to the reader. These addresses charged the English reformation with the re∣mains of Popery, and endeavoured to prevail with the Queen to strike off several ceremonies. This offensive application was probably the reason why these epistles were omitted in the next impression. The Queen's in∣dulging a French Presbyterian church in England en∣couraged great numbers of that nation, and of the Dutch, to come over and settle in the maritime towns: and here, under the shelter of the reformed religion, they maintained several gross errors and heresies. Some of these were German Anabaptists, and others, who propagated opinions of a very dangerous tendency. To stop the spreading of this infection, the Queen, by a proclamation, ordered those, both aliens and natural born English, who maintained these opinions, to de∣part the kingdom within one and twenty days, under penalty of imprisonment, and forfeiture of their goods. Notwithstanding this order, several skreened them∣selves with their Protestancy, and joined the French and Dutch congregations both in London and other places. And here, by venting some of their opinions, they oc∣casioned such warm contests, that Peter Martyr found it necessary to interpose his interest for bringing them to a better temper. To this purpose he wrote a letter, from Zurich, superscribed to the church of strangers in the city of London.</P>
<P>About this time another proclamation was set forth relating to the church. The Queen, by her injunc∣tions, had ordered the removing all paintings, and other monuments of counterfeit miracles and idolatry, both from churches and private houses. Some people, either out of avarice or puritanism, or both, had mis∣applied
<PB N="375" REF="406"/>the execution of this order, by carrying it much farther than her Majesty had intended. Thus, under the colour of these injunctions, they defaced the images of our blessed Saviour and his Apostles, and destroyed the historical representations of scripture in the church-windows: and their zeal carried them to the pulling away coats of arms, and monumental in∣scriptions, where they found any pictures in their neighbourhood. And because the bells had been con∣secrated, and the churches abused to superstition, and idolatrous worship, they took down the bells, turned the steeples to pigeon houses, and stripped the roof for the lead. All this ravage and disorder was forbid∣den by the proclamation, under pain of imprisonment during her Majesty's pleasure, and such farther fine for the contempt as shall be thought meet. A charge was likewise given to Bishops, and all other ordina∣ries, to enquire of all such contempts done from the beginning of her Majesty's reign, and to enjoin the persons offending to repair the same within a conve∣nient time, and of their doing therein to certify to the privy council, or the council in the star-chamber, that order may be taken therein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The collegiate church of St. Peter's Westminster, which had frequently changed its foundation, and suffered so many revolutions in figure and fortune within twenty years, had now a more lasting settlement. Fecknam the last abbot, and his convent, had an offer to keep their preferment, upon condition of taking the oath of su∣premacy, and officiating by the English Liturgy: but these conditions being refused, the abbey was dissolved by act of parliament. And the Queen having made choice of parcel of the best lands, conveyed the rest to that church: by her Majesty's letters-patent, bearing date the second year of her reign, the foundation is settled for a Dean, twelve secular canons, two schoolmasters, forty scholars, petty canons, and others belonging to the choir, to the number of thirty, and twelve alms-men. To which may be added stewards, receivers, and servants belonging to the college. The Dean had the custody of the <HI>regalia,</HI> assists at coronation solemnities, and is constituted justice of peace within Westminster and its liberties, by act of par∣liament. The Dean and Chapter have the privilege of great juris∣diction, both ecclesiastical and civil, within the city and liberties of Westminster, the precincts of St. Martin's le Grand, and some carishes in the county of Essex.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="376" REF="407"/>
<P>A. D. 1561.] The Queen wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, and the rest of the commissioners for causes ecclesiastical, to re∣view the <HI>Kalendar</HI> for the <HI>common prayer,</HI> to strike out some of the lessons, and appoint others which they should judge more serviceable and instructive. This letter complains that many churches were unrepaired to a scandalous degree; that they were unornamented and very negligently kept; which indecency and disregard is ordered to be rectified. Towards the latter end the Queen takes notice of her permission of the <HI>common prayer</HI> in Latin to collegiate churches, and commands these commissioners to take care that this allowance of her's may not be disappointed or mismanaged. That there was occasion for some alterations in the Kalendar, appears by the defectiveness of the last <HI>com∣mon prayer</HI> set forth in the reign of King Edward VI. where there was no direction for proper lessons on Sundays. But in a common prayer, printed in the year 1560, there is a Kalendar of first lessons for morning and evening prayer on Sundays, throughout the year, and for some Sundays the second lessons are appointed. This common prayer was printed before the Queen sent her letter to the commissioners above-mentioned, as may be collected from the dates. It is likely therefore that the Archbishop and the rest might settle the second lessons for Sundays, then unappointed, and make some further alterations in the rest of the Kalender. The Queen, making a progress this sum∣mer into Essex and Suffolk, took some umbrage at the figure and behaviour of the clergy; not finding them every where so conformable in their habit, so perfect in their office, nor so discreet in their management, as she expected. She was particularly displeased at seeing
<PB N="377" REF="408"/>their wives in cathedrals and colleges. She therefore issued out an order to forbid all heads and members of any college, or cathedral church within the realm, having their wives, or any other woman, within the precinct of such places, under the penalty of forfeiting all ecclesiastical promotions belonging to any cathedral or collegiate church. Secretary Cecil sent this unac∣ceptable order to Archbishop Parker: and to explain himself the better to Parker's satisfaction, he told him in a letter, that the Queen stood strongly disaffected to matrimony in the clergy; that, had it not been for something of courage and dexterity in himself, she had absolutely forbidden churchmen that state; and that he was glad to compound with her Majesty, and pro∣posed this expedient to prevent her going farther. The Archbishop sent the injunction through his pro∣vince, pursuant to her Majesty's order, but was greatly dissatisfied with the contents; and afterwards, upon his waiting on the Queen, he was surprised with her Majesty's discourse upon this subject, as appears by his letter to Secretary Cecil. He acquaints this minister, "that he was astonished to the last degree to hear so learned and conscientious a Princess treat the holy in∣stitution of matrimony with so much satyrical con∣tempt. I wonder (says he) that state should be made a crime in the clergy, which will stand the test of the last day; that an engagement which pleases God Al∣mighty should not please her Majesty. I am at a loss to understand why her Highness should gratify our ad∣versaries so far, as to put us under disfavour upon this account. If our reputation is thus disabled, we shall be rendered incapable of doing God and her Majesty service. As far as my reading and information reach∣es, it has been the custom of all Princes, both Chri∣stian and Pagan, to countenance the ministers of re∣ligion: they thought this a necessary expedient to re∣commend the rules of duty, to preserve the force of conscience, and support the government; but now it
<PB N="378" REF="409"/>is our misfortune to be singled out from the rest of mankind for infamy and aversion; to be exposed to the ignorant and malicious with marks of the greatest disadvantage; to be censured as if we had no regard to the circumstances of our profession; as if we were wholly resigned to appetite, without the least check of discretion. The Queen was so possessed with the no∣tion of our mismanagement in this matter, that she repented our being trusted with the function. This discovery must be sport to the clergy of the late reign: it must be a diversion to them to see in what manner we are handled, and with what distinguishing hard∣ships we are treated by the government. But this we shall pass over in patience, and rest the event with God Almighty." Whether the Secretary acquainted the Queen with this letter, or what success it had with her, does not appear: however, it shews that the Archbi∣shop was a plean dealer, and did not want courage.</P>
<P>The Pope renewed his attempt to gain the Queen, having invited her, with other Protestant Princes, to the council of Trent, and dispatched Abbot Marti∣nango into England with letters of very smooth con∣tents. Amongst other things, he acquainted her, that if she would please to send either Bishops or ambassa∣dors to the council, he did not question giving them such satisfaction as might open a way to a farther ac∣commodation. The Nuncio stopping in Flanders, sent to the Queen for leave to come forward: upon which, a council being called, and the matter debated, he was refused admittance, as the receiving him might imply an acknowledgment of that authority which had been abrogated by act of parliament.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">On June 4 this year a terrible fire happened in the cathedral of St. Paul's, London. It broke out near the top of the steeple, burnt down the spire to the stone work, and in four hours con∣sumed the timber and lead of the whole church. This church was one of the largest in all Christendom; seven hundred and twenty foot in length, a hundred and thirty in breadth, and in heighth, from the floor to the roof, a hundred and fifty. It was generally supposed to be set on fire by lightning: but Dr. Heylin says, that, within thirty years of the writing his Church-History, an old plumber confessed on his deathbed, that the church was burnt thro' his negligence, in leaving a pan of coals carelessly in the steeple when he went to dinner.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="379" REF="410"/>
<P>A. D. 1563.] A new parliament met at Westmin∣ster, January 12. The first act that passed this ses∣sions is the act of <HI>assurance of the Queen's power over all estates.</HI> It is pointed against those who maintained the "jurisdiction of the see of Rome, formerly unjustly claimed and usurped within this realm." To prevent the ill consequences arising from hence, those who maintain or defend, by printing, preaching, or teach∣ing, the Pope's authority or jurisdiction upon any part of her Majesty's dominions, as also their aiders, assis∣tants, and comforters, shall, for the first offence, in∣cur the penalties provided by the statute of premunire. There were likewise two other acts passed, one against fantastical prophesies, and another against witchcraft; and an act for translating the Bible and common prayer into Welsh. This last act puts the direction of the work into the hands of John Scory, Bishop of Here∣ford, Richard Davis of St. David's, Thomas Davis of St. Asaph, Rowland Merick of Bangor, and Hugh Jones of Landaff, who were to inspect the translation, and take care for the printing of such a number, that every cathedral, collegiate and parish church, and cha∣pel of ease, within their respective dioceses, where Welsh was commonly spoken, might be furnished with one.</P>
<P>In the convocation, which met on January 13, there were several things aimed at: but excepting a subsidy, and what related to the doctrinal articles, commonly called <HI>the thirty nine articles,</HI> nothing relative to doc∣trine or discipline passed; unless we reckon the autho∣rising of the Latin catechism, drawn up for the use of schools. This catechism lay unpublished till the year
<PB N="380" REF="411"/>1570, when, at the instance of the two Archbishops, it was printed with a dedication to them and their suf∣fragans. It was afterwards translated into English and Greek. In the whole, it was much the same with that set forth in the reign of King Edward VI.</P>
<P>A. D. 1564.] This summer the Queen made a visit to Cambridge; where being received with all kinds of honour by the university, and entertained with trage∣dies, comedies, and scholastical disputations, she sur∣veyed every college; and took her leave with a Latin oration, giving them encouragement to pursue their studies.</P>
<P>The English Bishops, being impowered by their canons, began to shew their authority, in urging the clergy of their dioceses to subscribe to the liturgy, rites, and discipline of the church; and such as refused were branded with the name of Puritans. The Non∣conformists at this time were divided into two ranks; some, mild and moderate, contented only to enjoy their own opinions; others, fierce and fiery, to the distur∣bance of church and state. Among the former was John Fox, who being summoned by Archbishop Par∣ker to subscribe, produced the New Testament in Greek, and said, "To this I will subscribe." But when a subscription to the canons was desired of him, he re∣fused it, saying, "I have nothing in the church, save a prebend at Salisbury; and if you will take it from me, much good may it do you."</P>
<P>The exiles, returned from Geneva, had begun dis∣putes about the cap, surplice, and other ecclesiastical habits. Their aversion to the habits of the clergy was sounded on their having been worn by Papists; though they had most of them been in use before any of the corruptions of Popery were known in the world. These ill supported scruples made the church look strangely disfigured and party-coloured: therefore the Queen thought fit to make a further signification of her royal pleasure, legally declared by her Commissioners for
<PB N="381" REF="412"/>causes ecclesiastical, according to the acts and statutes made in that behalf. The Archbishop is thereupon required, to consult with such Bishops and Commissi∣oners, as were next at hand; upon the making of such rules and orders as they thought necessary, for the peace of the church, with reference to the present state thereof. By a statute made in the last parliament, for keeping her Majesty's subjects in their due obe∣dience, a power was given to the Bishops to tender and receive the oath of supremacy of all manner of persons residing and dwelling in their several dioceses. Bonner was then prisoner in the Marshalsea, which, being within the borough of Southwark, brought him within the jurisdiction of Horn Bishop of Winchester, by whose Chancellor the oath was tendered to him. On the refusal of the oath, he was indicted at the King's Bench, upon the statute, to which he appeared, and desired that council might be assigned to plead his cause; which was granted. The business came under consideration in the parliament, which met on Septem∣ber 30, where the legality of Horn's episcopacy (which was objected against, in the behalf of Bonner) was cleared by statute, declaring the legality of those Eng∣lish Bishops authority, whose call and consecration to their place was formerly performed.</P>
<P>This year there was a design for reprinting the Ge∣neva Bible; and some time had been spent in the re∣view and correction of it. John Bodleigh, one of the principal undertakers, applied to Secretary Cecil for a longer term in the property of the copy. The Secre∣tary refused to assist them, till he had consulted Arch∣bishop Parker, and Grindal Bishop of London. It is probable Cecil might demur to the encouraging another impression, because the Bishops intended shortly to publish a translation of their own. However, the Archbishop and Grindal wrote to him in behalf of the undertakers; but not without some conditions of se∣curity,
<PB N="380" REF="413"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="381" REF="414"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="382" REF="415"/>viz. that the undertakers should engage to let the impression pass under their regulation, and not be pub∣lished without their consent and advice. They, not being willing to come under these restraints, deferred the impression till after Parker's death.</P>
<P>A. D. 1566.] The Archbishop having lately moved the Queen and Secretary Cecil to assist him in the ex∣ercise of discipline, her Majesty issued out her procla∣mation, requiring conformity to the habit. The pe∣nalty of disobeying the order was deprivation and dis∣ability of preaching: and since the Archbishop com∣plained that the London clergy had shewn themselves more stiff in their non-conformity, and that their prac∣tice made an impression upon the country, the Secre∣tary acquainted him, that the Queen was willing the reformation should begin there; and that, in case of non-compliance, it would be expedient to press their authority, and proceed with resolution. And to coun∣termine their proceedings, and take off the imputation of rigour, her Majesty designed to join some secular persons of quality in the commission with them. The twenty-sixth of March was appointed for this trial, and Cecil sent the Archbishop word, that the Lord Keeper Bacon, the Marquis of Northampton, and himself, in∣tended to be there: but none of them came; for it seems they recollected themselves, and declined having a share in such unacceptable business. The city clergy appeared at Lambeth, and several of them were per∣suaded to quit their prejudices, and preserve themselves. The Archbishop sent the Secretary a particular account of their proceedings. The issue was, sixty-one of them promised conformity, nine or ten refused to appear, and thirty-seven could not be brought to compliance. Some of these last were men not ill distinguished as preachers; but several of them, as the Archbishop re∣ports, seemed to have a great deal of zeal and good meaning, but with a very moderate proportion of
<PB N="383" REF="416"/>learning and judgment. According to the measures preconcerted, those, who continued unreclaimed, had the discipline driven home upon them: and, the pe∣nalties of silencing and sequestration being executed, and no sign of relaxation upon what was to follow, the dissenters broke out into remonstrances, and loudly complained of hard usage.</P>
<P>However, the bulk of the Puritan party stood firm in their old opinions: and, for their encouragement, they were not without friends at court. Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester, and Sir Francis Knolles Vice Cham∣berlain, favoured them; and Sir Francis Walsingham, afterwards secretary of state, was supposed to be in the same interest. Besides, Parkhurst, Sandys, and Pil∣kington, Bishops of Norwich, Worcester and Durham, leaned to their side in this controversy. But the Queen would not endure any innovation.</P>
<P>A. D. 1567.] This year the controversy touching the habits occasioned farther misunderstandings, and ended in an open rupture; for now the Puritans drew off from the church, formed separate congregations, and laid the common prayer book wholly aside. They pretended that methods of compulsion, and tying the "ceremonies of Antichrist to the service of God," was the reason of their going off. However, they did not at first use extemporary prayers; but officiated by the book made use of by the English refugees at Ge∣neva; to which there were some additional prayers subjoined. Thus they quitted the communion of the church, and formed a schism. However, several of their ministers thought, that they carried their excep∣tions too far, and refused to join them in their se∣paration. These non-conforming meetings incensed the government, and put the commissioners upon looking after them. About a hundred of these dissenters met in Plumber's hall, under the pretence of a wedding; but this excuse being thought too slender, about fif∣teen of them were apprehended. The next day seven
<PB N="384" REF="417"/>of them, viz. Smith, Nixon, White, Ireland, Haw∣kins, Rowland, and Morecraft, were examined before Grindal Bishop of London, who was not very forward himself to press conformity: and because they insisted on the platform of foreign churches, and pretended to be governed by their precedent, the Dean of Westmin∣ster told them, that all the men of learning in Europe were of a different sentiment as to their case. To this the Bishop of London added, that even the learned in Geneva were against them. He produced a letter from some of the ministers in that city. The ex∣pression which most affected them was this, "That they should exercise their office against the will of their Prince and Bishops, we do so much the more tremble at." To reconcile them to the establishment, Grindal asked them the following question, Have we not a godly Prince? Speak, is she evil? To this three of them made their several answers thus. William White, "What a question is that? the fruits do shew." Thomas Rowland: "No, but the servants of God are perse∣cuted under her." Robert Hawkins: "Why, this question the prophet answereth in the Psalms: how can they have understanding that work iniquity, spoiling my people, and extol vanity?" In the progress of their examination they objected against the form of the consecrated bread. Their cavil was, because it was given in wafers; which, they said, was going too near the Roman communion. The Bishop of London replied, that the church of Geneva, for whose practice they had so great a regard, received it in wafer-cakes. When arguing and gentle applications made no im∣pression, when, instead of promising to forbear their meetings, they discovered a resolution of maintaining their sentiments and separation, some of them were re∣manded back to prison; but they were soon after set at liberty. The more learned and considerable mini∣sters of this party disliked these excesses. It is true, they scrupled the practice of the ceremonies suffered in
<PB N="385" REF="418"/>their preferments, and chose rather to throw up their functions than to comply. But, notwithstanding their disagreement in these matters, they were by no means for driving the contest to a schism.</P>
<P>A. D. 1568.] This year Thomas Harding, and Nicholas S unders, Doctors in Divinity, received an authority from the Pope to absolve all the English who returned to the Romish communion. They were like∣wise empowered to dispense in all cases of irregularity, wilful murder excepted. Their commission extended to absolution for heresy, provided the persons recon∣ciled abstained three years from officiating at the altar. One Thomas Heath, a Jesuit, brother to the late Archbishop of York, was seized at Rochester. He was sent over missionary by his superiors, with instruc∣tions to pretend himself a dissenter. He was furnished with several Anabaptistical and Arian tracts, and was to throw in a mixture of Puritan doctrines. This Heath, after six years preaching about the coun∣try, in the habit of a poor minister, applied himself to the Dean of Rochester for preferment. The Dean, to try his talents, gave him a turn in the cathedral. In his sermon, he refined a little upon the church of England, and warped towards Puritanism. His text was, that <HI>prayer was made without ceasing unto God for St. Peter.</HI> From hence he took occasion to observe, that these prayers were not such as were then used in the English Liturgy. As it happened, a letter dropped out of his pocket from the pulpit, which was taken up by the Sexton, and delivered to Guest the Bishop. It was superscribed to him, by the name of Thomas Fine, from one Malt, a Jesuit of character in Madrid. The purport of it was to instruct him in the manage∣ment of his mission. Upon this discovery the Bishop examined him closely. At first, he only owned, that he had been a Jesuit, but was now of another per∣suasion: that he was not entirely of the sentiment of the episcopal party, but endeavoured to carry protes∣tancy
<PB N="386" REF="419"/>to a farther improvement, and set the reformed at more distance from the church of Rome. After this, upon searching his chamber, they found a licence from the Jesuits, and a bull from Pope Pius V. In this instrument there was a discretionary latitude, for preaching what doctrine his superiors thought fit: which compass was allowed in order to make misun∣derstandings among the Protestants. In his trunk were found several books against infant baptism, with other heterodoxies. For this foul practice he was sentenced to stand three days in the pillory at Roches∣ter, his ears were cut off, his nose slit, and his fore∣head marked with the letter R. He was likewise condemned to perpetual imprisonment; but death re∣leased him in a few months afterwards.</P>
<P>A. D. 1569.] The store of Papists in England began now much to diminish. Prisons consumed many, age more of their priests, and they had no place in Eng∣land whence to recruit themselves. Hereupon they resolved to erect colleges abroad, for the education of English youth. This project, which began this year, was so effectually prosecuted, that, within the compass of fifty years, they had founded nine colleges, and furnished with students, for whom they provided a maintenance. Doway college, in Flanders, was founded 1569, by Philip the Second King of Spain: all the recusants in England being benefactors to it. The first rector was William Allen, afterwards Cardinal. Whereas the government of all other English colleges belong to Jesuits, this only is ruled by secular priests. The second college was at Rome, founded anno 1579; Pope Gregory XIII. gave maintenance therein, first to six, then to fourteen, and at last to threescore scholars, to the yearly value of four thou∣sand crowns. The Welch hospital in Rome, founded and endowed many hundred years before, by Cad∣wallader King of Wales, for Welch pilgrims, with the rich lands thereof, was conferred by the said Pope
<PB N="387" REF="420"/>on this college. The thrid college was founded by Philip the Second King of Spain, at Valladolid in Old Castile. Donna Louisa de Caravaial, a rich widow lady in Spain, gave all her estate to this college, and came over to England, where she died. Father Wal∣pole, by pretending to have gained Lord Wotton's son and heir to the Romish persuasion, got above five hundred pounds to this college. Sir Francis Inglefield, privy counsellor to Queen Mary, forsaking his fine estate in Berkshire, at Queen Elizabeth's accession was a bountiful benefactor to this college. The fourth col∣lege was at Seville, founded by Philip the Second King of Spain, anno 1593. The fifth was at St. Omer's in Artois, founded 1596, by the same Monarch, who gave them a good annuity; for whose soul they say every day a mass, and every year an <HI>Obitum.</HI> Their Rector is generally a Fleming, though the college is of English only. The sixth college was at Madrid, founded 1606. The seventh, a college at Louvain, in Brabant, founded the same year, by Philip the Third King of Spain, who gave a castle with a pension to the Eng∣lish Jesuits to build them a college. The eighth col∣lege was at Liege in Lukeland, founded 1616. The Archbishop of Cologne (being at this time also Bishop of Liege) gave them a pension to live on, and leave to build a college. Many of the English nobility and gentry, under pretence of passing to the Spa to re∣cover their healths, visited this college, and made them large donations. The ninth college was at Ghent in Flanders, founded 1624, by Philip the Fourth, who gave them a pension. It is incredible what a vast sum of money was yearly carried out of England for the maintenance of these colleges, having here their pro∣vincials, subprovincials, assistants, and agents, who collected for them. The two colleges of Doway and Rome received such encouragement, and flourished to that degree, that when Sanders wrote, above 300
<PB N="388" REF="421"/>priests had been sent over from thence into Eng∣land. To engage the members of these societies the more firmly, and harden them for the business to which they were bred, they obliged them to take the following oath at their admission, provided they were grown up to mens estate.</P>
<P>"I <HI>A. B.</HI> one bred in this English college, considering how great benefits God hath bestowed upon me, but then especially when he brought me out of my own country, so much infected with heresy, and made me a member of the Catholic church, as also desiring with a thankful heart to improve so great a mercy of God, have resolved to offer up myself wholly to divine ser∣vice, as much as I may, to fulfil the end for which this college was founded. I promise therefore, and swear, in the presence of Almighty God, that I am prepared, from my heart, with the assistance of divine grace, in due time to receive holy orders, and to re∣turn into England, to convert the souls of my coun∣trymen and kindred, when, and as often as it shall seem good to the superior of this college, &amp;c."</P>
<P>The court of Rome having waited a long time for Queen Elizabeth's recollection, and despairing now of her recovery, resolved to proceed to extremities, and declare her excommunicated; and published a bull to this effect. About two years after, one John Felton was drawn, hanged, and quartered, for publishing this bull, and pasting it up on the gates of the Bishop of London's palace.</P>
<P>A. D. 1570] This year a parliament met at West∣minster, wherein several acts passed against Papists and Nonconformists. Against the first it was enacted, "That to write, print, preach, or affirm, that the Queen was an heretic, schismatic, &amp;c. should be ad∣judged treason; and that it should be so accounted, and punished, to bring, and put in execution, any bulls, instruments, writings, &amp;c. from the see of Rome, from the first of July following." An act was made
<PB N="389" REF="422"/>also against fugitives, who, being natural born-subjects of this realm, departed the same without licence. A∣gainst Non-conformists it was provided, "That every minister should, before December 25 next following, in the presence of his Diocesan or his deputy, declare his assent to all the articles of religion agreed on in the convocation of 1563, upon pain of deprivation on the refusal thereof." Against covetous Conformists it was provided, "That no spiritual college, or hospital, shall let lease, other than for the term of twenty years, or three lives; the usual rent, or more, reserved pay∣able yearly during the said term." It has been already observed, that the reformation was oftentimes mis∣managed to the impovershing the clergy England was not the only scene of oppression; the Irish church lay under the same disadvantage, as appears by a letter from the Archbishop of Dublin to Secretary Cecil. He applies to this minister in relation to the deanery of St. Patrick's; desiring that he would move the Queen, that this preferment might not be bestowed upon any layman, nor made a fee for the Lord Chancellor; but that the Chapter might enjoy the privilege of their charter, and chuse some learned divine. He likewise complains of the great want of teachers in that king∣dom, alledging that the disloyalty of the subjects was owing to their ignorance: that the greatest number of benefices within the English pale are impropriated to her Majesty, and farmed out to such as have no care for the cure; and that religion suffers very much upon this score: that he wished her Majesty would rather be pleased to quit some part of her impropriations for the maintenance of the ministry, who were in a very miserable situation.</P>
<P>A. D. 1571.] The convocation met, on April 3, in the chapter house of St. Paul's. The sermon was preached by Dr. Whitgift, his text being in Acts xv. 6, <HI>The apostles and elders came together to consult of this matter.</HI> From hence he took occasion to discourse up∣on
<PB N="390" REF="423"/>the institution and authority of synods, touched up∣on the opposition made to the church by Puritans and Papists, dilated on the use of distinct habits and reli∣gious ornaments, and mentioned several things which required reformation. In the third session Cheney Bishop of Gloucester was excommunicated, for not appearing at the convocation, not constituting a proxy. This unusual censure was passed upon the Bishop for contempt. It was pronounced by the Archbishop, with the consent of the upper house. But some time after Higgins, the Bishop's chaplain, exhibited let∣ters of proxy for his Lord, and moved the Bishop might receive absolution, which was granted.</P>
<P>A. D. 1572.] The canons made in 1563 were not for nine years afterwards confirmed by act of parlia∣ment: but being ratified by parliamentary authority, the Bishops began the urging of them more severely than before, which occasioned great disputes with the Puritans. About this time Chark, Trevers, Gardiner, Barber, Chester, Crook, and Egerton, joined the rest of the Puritan party, in order to their settling of their discipline.<NOTE PLACE="inter">The first pres∣bytery in Eng∣land.</NOTE> In order to this they erected a presbytery at Wandsworth in Surry; which, being situated upon the Thames, was a convenient place for forming a con∣gregation out of the Dissenters in the city. This first establishment was called the <HI>Order of Wandsworth</HI> by Field, who was their minister. Whether the Queen was presently informed of this establishment, is uncer∣tain; however, complaints being carried to court of their behaviour, she issued a proclamation, "That the laws for keeping up a uniformity of public worship should be put in execution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year happened a cruel massacre at Paris, the Queen of Navarre and all the heads of the protestants being invited there to a marriage between Henry of Navarre, and the King's sister. Above two thousand persons were murdered in Paris the first day, besides what was killed in the two days following. And Admiral Coligny, the pillar of the reformed church, was killed in his bed on Bartho∣lomew-eve.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="391" REF="424"/>
<P>The Anabaptists began now to increase in England. On Easter-day, a Dutch congregation of them was dis∣covered without Aldgate in London, whereof twenty∣seven were taken and imprisoned; and four, bearing faggots at St. Paul's cross, solemnly recanted their opi∣nions. In the next month one Dutchman and ten women were condemned, of whom, one woman re∣nounced her errors, eight were banished, and two, the most obstinate, were burnt in Smithfield, where they died with great horror.</P>
<P>A. D. 1573.] One Peter Burchet, who had per∣suaded himself that it was lawful to kill any that had opposed the truth of the gospel, drew his dagger upon Hawkins, the famous navigator, in the open street, and wounded him, supposing him to be Hatton, who was then in great favour with the Queen. Being com∣mitted to the Tower of London, he killed one of his keepers with a billet, which he snatched up out of the chimney; for which he was hanged, after having his right-hand cut off and nailed to the gallows.</P>
<P>A. D. 1575.] This year died, on the 17th of May, Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury. After the see had been vacant above half a year, Grindal Archbishop of York was preferred to it: but before he had passed through all the forms, and compleated his character, the convocation, after several prorogations, was re∣assembled at St. Paul's, and, according to custom, the Bishop of London was president.</P>
<P>A. D. 1576.] At the second session, on February 17, this year, Grindal's translation being perfected, he came into the convocation-house at St. Paul's, and took the presidentship upon himself. There was no business done till the 17th of March, when the Arch∣bishop ordered the reading of several articles, after∣wards
<PB N="392" REF="425"/>subscribed by both houses, relating to the regu∣lation of the clergy.</P>
<P>A. D. 1577.] The Roman Catholic missionaries, sent from the seminaries beyond sea, made some pro∣gress in their undertaking, and drew off a great many people from going to church. To stop this defection from reformation, it was thought fit to impose a pecu∣niary penalty on such as absented themselves from divine service: but, there being no provision by act of parli∣ament, the legality of the method was debated. The judges, being summoned to give their opinion of the matter, resolved, that, by the statute of the ist of E∣lizabeth, the commissioners for ecclesiastical causes had authority to inflict any punishment, either amerciament, or otherwise, which the ecclesiastical laws allowed of. The ground of their opinion was, because all ecclesia∣stical jurisdiction and authority is by that statute an∣nexed to the crown; and, by the same statute, her Majesty is impowered to commit this authority to such persons as she thinks proper to employ. Cuthbert Main, a Romish priest, was condemned and executed at Launceston in Cornwall; and Mr. Trugeon, who entertained him in his house, was sentenced to perpe∣tual imprisonment.</P>
<P>A. D. 1579.] A sect called the Family of Love, grew so numerous, that the Privy Council thought fit to endeavour their suppression. They persuaded their followers, "That those only were to be elected, and saved, which were admitted into that family, and all the rest reprobates and to be damned; and that it was lawful for them to deny, upon their oath, before a magistrate, whatsoever they list." They dispersed books among their followers, translated from the Dutch tongue into English, which they intitled, <HI>The Gospel of the Kingdom, Documental Sentences, the Prophecy of the Spirit of Love, and the publishing of Peace upon Earth.</HI> The author of these books was Henry Nicholas of Leyden, who blasphemously said,
<PB N="393" REF="426"/>"That he did partake of God, and God of his huma∣nity." This man came over into England in the reign of Edward VI. and joined himself to the Dutch congre∣gation at London, where he seduced many artificers and silly women. Micronius and Charineus, then ministers of the Dutch congregation, zealously con∣futed his errors; but it seems their antidotes did not take such effect as his poisons. To check the propo∣gation of their tenets, a proclamation was published, that the civil magistrate should be assistant to the ec∣clesiastic, for the timely suppressing them, and that their books should be burnt.</P>
<P>The Queen was now treating of a marriage with the Duke of Anjou; which alliance was not agreeable to the English. The Puritans were loudest in their re∣monstrances; and one Stubbs, a lawyer of that per∣suasion, wrote a book against the match, intitled, <HI>The gaping Gulph;</HI> which was penned with a great deal of heat and satire. The Queen looked upon these intemperate clamourings as no better than arraigning the government. Therefore, to check this insolence, a proclamation was issued for seizing the book, the au∣thor, and printer. Stubbs was taken in a sew days; and William Page, who dispersed the copies, and Sin∣gleton the printer, were also apprehended. Stubbs and Page had their right-hands cut off with a cleaver, upon a scaffold in the market-place at Westminster; but the printer was pardoned. When Stubbs's right-hand was cut off, he listed off his hat with the other, exclaiming with a loud voice, "God save the Queen;" and the populace, in profound silence, testified their horror of the barbarity of the court, and the submission of the delinquent, who was a man of some note and unblemished reputation.</P>
<P>This year Matthew Hammond, a plow-wright of Hetherfell near Norwich, was convened before the Bishop for heresy and blasphemy. He denied the in∣spiration of the New Testament, the divinity of our
<PB N="394" REF="427"/>Saviour and the Holy Ghost, the necessity of baptism, and the holy eucharist. He abused the Queen and council with opprobrious language, for which he was sen∣tenced to lose his ears; and, persisting in his heresies and blasphemous expressions, he was, at last, burnt in the castle-ditch at Norwich.</P>
<P>A. D. 1580.] Some English Jesuits, most distin∣guished for learning and courage, were sent over, this year, into England, for the conversion (as they call it) of the country. Amongst these missionaries, Robert Parsons and Edmund Campion were the most remark∣able. These men, prosecuting their mission with great alacrity and vigour, prevailed with abundance of the common people, and several persons of learning and quality, to return to the communion of the church of Rome. They are said to have acted in a very sediti∣ous manner: some of them being so hardy as to affirm, that the crown belonged to the Queen of Scots; that Queen Elizabeth ought to be deposed; that if the Pope commanded one thing, and her Majesty the con∣trary, his Holiness was to be obeyed. To prevent the danger from such a mission, the Queen published a proclamation, commanding, that all those who had children, relations, or wards, beyond the sea, should certify their names to the ordinary, and recall them home within four months: and in case they refused to return, not to supply them with remittances, by bills of exchange, or any other way. They were likewise forbid to entertain or support any Jesuits or seminary of priests: and, when they knew where any such persons might be found, they were commanded to discover them, and put them into the magistrates hands, under the penalties of being prosecuted as abettors of rebellion. That the strictness of this order might not be surprising, the proclamation sets forth, that the business of these missionaries was not only to gain proselytes to their church, but to embroil the church, and draw off the peo∣ple from their allegiance. Parsons, a warm, rugged-tem∣pered
<PB N="395" REF="428"/>man, was very bold and seditious in his discourse; and went such extravagant lengths as to propose de∣throning the Queen, insomuch that some Roman Ca∣tholics designed to seize him, and deliver him to justice. Campion, more modest, and of a smoother disposition, offered to dispute with the English clergy, and sent them a public challenge. He likewise publish∣ed his <HI>Decem rationes</HI> (ten reasons) in defence of the Ro∣man communion, which was answered by Dr. White∣aker.</P>
<P>A. D. 1581.] The Duke of Anjou, being now at the English court, continued to solicit the marriage: as for the Queen, she was willing to quiet the appre∣hensions of the people, and silence the reports touch∣ing the toleration of popery. For this purpose, after great importunity, she consented to proceed to some extremities. Edmund Campion, the Jesuit, Ralph Sherwin, Luke Kirby, and Alexander Briant, priests, were tried for high treason upon the statute of the 25th of Edward III. They were charged in the indictment with compassing the Queen's death, and adhering to the Bishop of Rome; and that they came into England to raise a rebellion, and subvert the government. The jury brought them in guilty; and they were executed. Not long after several other Papists suffered upon the same score. The necessities of the times forced the Queen upon these severities: for she always declared herself averse to punishing people for conscience sake; but when principles and the Catholic religion were made a pretence for plotting and treason, she was forced to strike.</P>
<P>A. D. 1582.] The republic of Geneva, being appre∣hensive of a siege from the Duke of Savoy, sent an agent to England for support. Their case had been recommended to Walsingham by Brook the English ambassador at Paris. Reasons of state, besides other considerations, seem to have prevailed with the Queen to interpose in their behalf: and, since money was the
<PB N="396" REF="429"/>most practicable way of assistance, the council wrote to Archbishop Grindal to promote a contribution amongst the clergy. The Archbishop sent moving letters to his suffragans, and endeavoured to excite their com∣passion from the present distress of the Genevians. He likewise put them in mind, that this city deserved some return for their former favours to the English Pro∣testants.</P>
<P>A. D. 1583.] Grindal, Archbishop of Canterbury, having lost his sight, was somewhat disabled for his function. He had formerly desired the Queen for leave to relinquish his charge and retire. This motion, though then refused, was now thought reasonable. However it does not appear that the resignation was perfected before his death, which happened in July, at Croydon. He was succeeded by John Whitgift, a Prelate of great learning and vigour, who was translated from Worcester to Canterbury. At his first coming to the see, he had strict injunctions from Queen Eliza∣beth, to hold a strict rein, to press the discipline of the church, and recover his province to uniformity. This method agreed with the Archbishop's sentiment, and was probably suggested by himself: for he insisted strongly upon the clergy's subscribing the three articles, afterwards required by the canons passed in 1603; that is, "the Queen's ecclesiastical supremacy, the unex∣ceptionableness of the prayer and ordinal, and that the nine and thirty articles are altogether agreeable to the word of God."</P>
<P>About this time one Robert Brown,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Rise of the Brownists.</NOTE> de∣scended of a considerable family in the county of Rutland, began to publish his he∣terodoxies, and grow very troublesome. He was bred in Bennet college in Cambridge, fell into Cartwright's opinions, and at last went much farther in his singu∣larities. He was extravagantly satyrical against the church of England. In his discourses, he said, that her government was Antichristian, her sacraments
<PB N="397" REF="430"/>clogged with superstition, that the liturgy had a mix∣ture of popery and paganism in it; and that the missi∣on of the clergy was no better than that of Baal's priests in the Old Testament. And now, believing himself obliged to go out of Babylon, he went to Zealand, and joined Cartwright's congregation at Mid∣dleburgh: but even there finding fault with Cart∣wright's scheme, he resolved to produce something more perfect from his own invention. His model was drawn in a book, intitled, <HI>A treatise of reformation,</HI> whch had been printed the preceding year at Middle∣burgh. Having sent as many copies of it into Eng∣land as he thought necessary, he came over soon after himself. At this time the Dutch had a numerous congregation at Norwich; many of whom inclining to Anabaptism, were the more disposed to entertain any new opinions. Brown made his first essay among them; and after having made some progress, and raised himself a character for zeal and sanctity, he began to tamper with the English, taking in the assistance of Richard Harrison, a country school master. At length he formed churches of both nations, but mostly English: and instructed his audience, that the church of Eng∣land was no true church; that there was little of Christ's institution in the public ministrations, and that all good Christians were obliged to separate from those impure assemblies; that their next step was to join him and his disciples; that here was nothing but what was pure and unexceptionable, evidently inspired by the Spirit of God, and refined from all alloy and profana∣tion. Brown dispersed his books in most parts of the kingdom: but the government was far from conniving at these liberties; for Elias Thacker and John Cop∣ping were indicted this summer, for dispersing these pamphlets, brought in guilty of felony, and executed at St. Edmund's Bury. Brown, the author, was more favourably dealt with than either of these criminals: though, being convened before Edmund Freke Bishop
<PB N="398" REF="431"/>of Norwich, and other ecclesiastical commissioners, he not only maintained his schism, but misbehaved him∣self to the court, upon which he was committed to the custody of the Sheriff of Norwich. However, the Lord Treasurer Burleigh, being his near relation, pro∣cured his enlargement; and, after he had suffered a good deal by his obstinacy, he conformed so far as to take a benefice in Northamptonshire. But, though he conformed himself, it was not in his power to close the schism. Many of his followers continued unre∣claimed, and suffered death for their mispersuasion.</P>
<P>The Puritans were not without great men in their interest: amongst whom may be reckoned the Earls of Huntingdon and Leicester, Roger Lord North, Sir Francis Knolles, and Secretary Walsing∣ham: but as for the Queen, she had no good opinion of the Dissenters. They maintained some uncourtly doctrine, as it was then reckoned: they confined her Majesty's supremacy to temporal jurisdiction: they did not caress her prerogative, nor stretch her empire far enough into the church. This made her cold to inter∣cession, and disabled their patrons from doing them much service: and to prevent importunities of this kind, she referred ecclesiastical business entirely to Whitgift's management. This Prelate acted vigorous∣ly, and answered the confidence put in him. The great men at court who favoured the Puritans, finding the Archbishop countenanced by the Queen, and him∣self a person of such resolution, did not think fit to en∣gage their character, and risque their fortunes by an open opposition.</P>
<P>As the Dissenters were troublesome on one hand, so on the other some bigotted Papists engaged in desperate designs. John Somerville, a Warwickshire gentle∣man, heated to rage and distraction by some scanda∣lous pamphlets, made his way privately towards the Queen's apartment, assaulted one or two with his drawn sword, and, being apprehended, confessed that
<PB N="399" REF="432"/>he intended to kill the Queen. Though this man was apparently frantic, one Edward Arden, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of the same county, Arden's wife, their daughter married to Somerville, and one Hall a priest, were arraigned at Guildhall, and brought in quality of high treason upon the evidence of this lunatic. About three days after, Somerville strangled himself in the prison; and Arden was drawn, hanged and quartered, but the women and the priest were pardoned.</P>
<P>A. D. 1584.] The parliament met this year No∣vember 23, and an act passed for obliging Roman Catholic priests and Jesuits, who practised sometimes against the state upon the excommunicating bull of Pope Pius V. to depart the kingdom within forty days, and not to return under the penalty of high treason. The convocation met the day after the par∣liament, in which little was done besides granting a subsidy. On the 18th of December, John Hilton, clerk, who had been imprisoned by the high commis∣sion for error, heresy, and blasphemy, was ordered to be convened. He appeared on the twenty-second, and confessed the accusation; and that, in a sermon at St. Martin's in the Felds, he had affirmed that the Old and New Testaments are but fables; that he had blasphemed our Saviour, and declared himself a Hea∣then. After this he gave in his abjuration in writing: upon which submission, penance was injoined him, and he was ordered to make a solemn recantation in St. Martin's church, the convocatioon being present.</P>
<P>A. D. 1585.] An assembly of the dissenters had met at the same time as the parliament and convoca∣tion, but the certain place of their meeting was not known. Their agents had constantly attended the parliament-house, strongly soliciting their business. What impression they made may appear by a letter to her Majesty, from Archbishop Whitgift, wherein he complaineth of several bills that had, the day before the date of his letter, passed in the house of Commons,
<PB N="400" REF="433"/>in favour of the non-conformists, about marrying at all times in the year, concerning ecclesiastical courts, and episcopal visitations. This letter either found or made the Queen of the Archbishop's sentiment; for the bills and debates in the lower house come to no∣thing, and no alteration passed upon the discipline of the church this session. On the twenty ninth of March the Queen made a speech to both houses at the proro∣gation of the parliament. She takes notice that some people have been busy in finding faults with the clergy; that a censure of this kind reflected upon herself: for since God had made her an over-ruler of the church, her negligence could not be excused, if any schism or heresy was connived at. She grants-there may be some misbehaviour and omission amongst the body of the clergy; and that such miscarriage is common to all considerable offices. "All which (continue her Ma∣jesty) if you, my Lords of the clegy, do not amend, I mean to depose you. Look well therefore to your charge." The dissenters, failing of success in the parliament house, were somewhat discouraged. Cart∣wright himself, their leading man, was now willing to come to an accommodation, and made use of the Earl of Leicester to mediate with the Archbishop to that effect, as appears by letters that passed between the Archbishop and that nobleman, in July, this year. A presbytery was set up this year at Hatfield Peveril in Essex, by one Carew, a Puritan preacher. Ailmer Bishop of London being informed of it, summoned the preacher and several of the congregation before himself, and other ecclesiastical commissioners. These men, after examination, were committed. As for Carew, his ignorance, heterodoxies, and assurance, were very remarkable. He had his mission only from the people's election, despised all censures of the church, declaimed against the common prayer, and denied Christ's descent into hell. He maintained, that divisions were necessary, because our Saviour said,
<PB N="401" REF="434"/>"I came not to send peace, but a sword." He held that "the soul of man was part of the substance of God;" by consequence, that the soul was infinite, and that the Deity must suffer in the fate of those that were lost. He had misled his people to an indifferency for the sacrament of baptism: they said, "It made no matter for the water, as they had the word."</P>
<P>A. D. 1586.] This year is remarkable for the un∣precedented trial of Mary Queen of Scots, brought about by the indiscretion of her friends, and the jealous fears of Queen Elizabeth; who, to the in∣delible sullying of her character, permitted the sen∣tence to be executed upon that unfortunate Princess, in Fotheringhay castle, the year following, after she had been prisoner in England nineteen years, having fled thither for protection from her own rebellious subjects.</P>
<P>A. D. 1587.] Conformity was now pressed to the height. The power of the high commission began to extend far, and penalties to fall heavy on offenders: whereupon the dissenters much opposed it in their writings, some questioning the court as not warranted by law; others taxing their proceedings as exceeding their commission. But the most general exception against the high commission was, the proceeding <HI>ex officio mero,</HI> by way of inquiry against such whom they suspected: it being conceived unjust, that, in cases criminal, a party should be forced to discover what might be penal to himself. The lawfulness of this oath was learnedly canvassed on both sides. Be∣cause many questioned the authority of the high com∣mission, Archbishop Whitgift so contrived the matter, that the principal Non-conformists (especially if they had any visible estates) were brought into the star∣chamber, the power whereof was undisputed; where some of them, besides imprisonment, had very heavy fines laid upon them. And, because most of the
<PB N="402" REF="435"/>Queen's council were present at the censures, this took off the odium from the Archbishop.</P>
<P>A. D. 1588.] This year is famous for the destruc∣tion of the <HI>Invincible Armada,</HI> fitted out by the King of Spain, in order to invade England. For the happy event of this affair Queen Elizabeth appointed prayers and thanksgivings over all the churches in England. The Queen with a great train of the nobility came to St. Paul's church (where the banners taken from the enemy were displayed) and there, in a most humble manner, gave thanks to Almighty God, the giver of all victory. About this time many libels flew abroad, the main drift of which was to defame the English prelates, and render them odious to the common people, and to introduce the Geneva discipline. These libels were stuffed with such scandalous, virulent, and abusive language, as could scarce be imagined to drop from the mouth or pen of a Christian, and yet they were the work of some ministers and lay proselytes pretending to an uncommon purity and preciseness in religion. This year also the Popish clergy set forth a book, called <HI>the admonition,</HI> dispersed among the Pa∣pists, and much extolled. But the defeat of the Armada happening soon after its publication, Parsons procured the whole impression to be burnt (except some few sent abroad to his friends) that it might not remain a monument of their falsehood.</P>
<P>A. D. 1589.] The convocation met at St. Paul's this year on November 13, but there was nothing done, besides granting two subsidies, till the beginning of March, when the Archbishop brought in certain orders to be observed through the whole province. 1. That single benesiced men should be obliged to constant residence; but with an exception of liberty for prebendaries, and chaplains to the King or Peers. There was likewise a saving for those who were allowed non-residence by act of parliament. However, in these cases, they should be compelled to keep a licensed
<PB N="403" REF="436"/>preaching curate. 2. Double beneficed men were to reside equal proportions of time upon their respective livings, and to provide a licensed curate where they are absent. 3. Beneficed men absent an hundred and thirty days, were to keep licensed curates. 4. Scan∣dalous ministers, guilty of notorious crimes, must be removed, and never admitted into any cure. 5. Un∣learned ministers, unqualified to catechise, are barred admission to any cure. 6. None shall be allowed to place or displace a curate without authority from the Archbishop or Bishop of the diocese. These orders were agreed to by both houses, who promised to obey and execute them.</P>
<P>A. D. 1590.] This year Thomas Cartwright, Bat∣chelor, of Divinity, was brought before the Queen's com∣missioners for ecclesiastical causes, and the oath <HI>ex officio</HI> tendered to him, to answer divers articles ob∣jected against him. Every one of the commissioners assured him, upon their credit, that, by the laws of the realm, he was obliged to take the oath, and an∣swer the questions put to him. But Cartwright de∣sired to be excused, and told them he thought the laws of God brought him under no such necessity. Upon this non-compliance he was committed to the Fleet, to which prison several of his brethren had been sent some time before.</P>
<P>A. D. 1591.] About this time one Hacket, an illi∣terate, insolent, debauched fellow, who, having spent his substance in riotous living, had put on a demure face and turned Puritan, praying <HI>extempore,</HI> keeping Sunday fasts, and boasting of conflicts with Satan, en∣gaged in a wild enterprise for promoting the Geneva discipline. Wiggington, a puritanical preacher, made him acquainted with Coppinger and Arthington, both alike enthusiastical pretenders to a divine call and su∣pernatural revelations. They formed a charge of trea∣son against Archbishop Whitgift, and Sir Christopher Hatton the Lord Chancellor; threatened to dispatch
<PB N="404" REF="437"/>them; published seditious papers and ballads to in∣cite the mob to an insurrection; and pretended to have a power to dethrone the Queen (whose picture Hacket had stabbed with a dagger) if she would not encourage their projected reformation. Hacket, having persuaded Coppinger and Arthington, that they had more than a prophetical spirit in them, and were angelical vi∣sioners, set up himself for Christ, or at least for a King, informed by the same divine spirit, and partaker of his glorified nature, come down from heaven to plant the gospel through Europe, and to establish a church-discipline in England. This was, by Cop∣pinger and Arthington, who called themselves his two prophets, proclaimed through the streets of Lon∣don, affirming it on their salvation, and declaring, "that Hacket was the supreme Monarch of the world; that all the Princes of Europe held their scep∣ters of him; and that the Queen was to be deposed." They were soon apprehended, and behaved themselves with intolerable insolence before the council. Hac∣ket, being tried for treason, and confessing himself guilty, was condemned; and uttered the most shock∣ing blasphemous and treasonable expressions at his ex∣ecution. Coppinger starved himself to death in prison: but Arthington lived to repent, made a formal recan∣tion, and became an object of the Queen's mercy. The Puritans were at this time busy in exclaiming and writing against ecclesiastical courts: but the Queen, knowing their view was to undermine the discipline of the church, and to wound her prerogative through the sides of the hierarchy, repressed their measures; and keeping a strict hand over them, obliged them for a time to be quiet. The Papists too, on occasion of an English seminary's being founded at Valladolid, were put in mind of the laws forbidding them to send their children to such places of education, which they had lately done in more than ordinary numbers: and, for the more effectual discovery of this practice, a
<PB N="405" REF="438"/>proclamation was issued against Jesuits and seminary priests, "forbidding all persons, throughout the realm, to lodge or harbour any man whatever, except they first enquired who he was, whether he frequented the service of the church, what estate he had to live on, where he resided the year before," and into other the like circumstances. To provide a more proper place for the education of her Irish subjects, the Queen this year founded a college in Dublin, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, endowing it with a power of con∣ferring degrees, and other privileges of an university; which hath since produced many eminent and learned men, who have done service to religion, and no small honour to their country.</P>
<P>A. D. 1592.] Upwards of 10,000 died in London this year of the plague, Mr. Udel was indicted, and arraigned, at Croydon, for defaming the Queen, and her government, in a book he had published. He pleaded not guilty, denying himself to be the author of the book. The jury brought him in guilty: but he was remanded to the Marshalsea. In the March following he was brought again to the bar, at the assizes held in Southwark, and was there condemned to be executed for a felon: but the execution was prevented by his death, without any other sickness except that occasioned by sorrow.</P>
<P>A. D. 1593.] In the session of parliament, which ended this year, on April, by dissolution, an act passed "for retaining the Queen's subjects in their due obedience;" designed chiefly against the Roman Catholics, but likewise affecting the Puritans, whom the Queen, since their setting up a form of discipline and government in opposition to the laws and the royal authority, was desirous more than ever to sup∣press. In her visit the last year to the university of Oxford, where she received a splendid treat from the Lord Buckhurst their Chancellor, and was entertained with speeches, plays, and academical exercises, much
<PB N="406" REF="439"/>to her satisfaction, she had advised them, "to be careful to serve God, not with the novel and fantasti∣cal devotion practised by some, but according to the laws of God and the land; not to outrun the laws, but follow them; not to dispute the fitness or obliga∣tion thereof, but sincerely obey such as were in force, and submit to their superiors; and lastly, to preserve peace, union, and concord, among themselves." By the act now made, "all persons, above the age of sixteen, absenting themselves from church for a month, or by printing, writing, or words, persuading others to do so, were to be imprisoned, till they conformed, and made an open declaration of their conformity, ac∣cording to a form prescribed; if they did not conform within three months after their conviction, they were to abjure the realm; and, if they either refused to make such abjuration, or did not go abroad within the time limited for their departure, they were to suffer as felons, without benefit of clergy." The harbour∣ing or relieving offenders, and the resort to conventi∣cles, were likewise forbidden. The favourers of the Puritans had not now credit or power enough at court to prevent the execution of this and other laws. Henry Barrow, a gentleman; and John Greenwood, a priest, were condemned and executed at Tyburn, for writing certain seditious pamphlets: and soon after John Penry, a Welchman, was arraigned and condemned of fe∣lony, at the King's Bench bar, for being a principal penner and publisher of a libel, called <HI>Martin Mar∣prelate,</HI> and executed.</P>
<P>A. D. 1594.] This year died at Rome Cardinal William Allen, and was buried in the church of the English college. He was much regretted by the Ca∣tholics: for, besides the service of his pen, he kept the English Papists from breaking out into misunder∣standings, and made up the differences between the secular priests and Jesuits.</P>
<PB N="407" REF="440"/>
<P>A. D. 1595.] There arose great debates among the reformed concerning the doctrines of predestination, free-will, the force of divine assistance, and the extent of redemption. A more solemn and strict observation of the Lord's day, throughout England, commenced about this time, occasioned by a book wrote and pu∣blished by Dr. Bound.</P>
<P>A. D. 1596.] Richard Fletcher, Bishop of London, departed this life. He is said to have taken the see of Bristol upon terms of compliance, closed with foul pro∣posals, and almost secularised the see, by letting leases upon inconsiderable rents reserved. He mismanaged, in the same manner, upon his translation to London. John Coldwell, Doctor of Physic, and Bishop of Salis∣bury, died about the same time. He proved a very unfortunate prelate to the bishopric. In this reign, it was the method of some courtiers to look out for churchmen unfurnished with merit or honesty, and pre∣fer them for tools to their avarice. Coldwell happen∣ing to be thus qualified, Sir Walter Raleigh made use of the opportunity, and obtained Sherborn castle, with the manor, park, &amp;c. To make his design bear, he solicited the Queen to give way to the alienation; and having got over that difficulty, the remaining part was easy enough; for Coldwell, either out of cowardice or covetousness, seems to have resigned without struggle. The Bishop, who, it is to be hoped, repented his bar∣gain, died a beggar. And as for Sir Walter, it was thought by superstitious people, that this forbidden seizure overlaid his prosperity, and made him sink with his sacrilege.</P>
<P>A. D. 1597.] In October this winter the parliament met at Westminster, in which two acts passed relating to the church. By one of them, the deprivation of the Bishops who refused to comply with the reforma∣tion is confirmed; and all Archbishops, Bishops, and Deans, promoted by the Queen to their respective dig∣nities and stations, from any time since her accession
<PB N="408" REF="441"/>to the throne to the 10th of November, in the fourth year of her reign, are declared lawfully constituted. The reason of making this act was, as the preamble sets forth, because the parties deprived made secret ap∣peals, and used other clandestine methods to support their claim and pretensions. The other act, concern∣ing the church, was, <HI>the establishment of the bishopric of Norwich, and the revenues belonging to it, against a pre∣tended concealed title.</HI> A bill for relieving the poor out of impropriations was twice read in the house of Com∣mons, and, after some controversy, was thrown out. The parliament was dissolved on the 9th of February following.</P>
<P>A D. 1598.] This year the celebrated Sir Edward Coke, and Elizabeth, relict of Sir William Hatton, marrying without banns or licence, Henry Bothwell priest, rector of Okeover, who married them, and se∣veral persons of condition present at the wedding, were prosecuted in the Archbishop's court, although the lady was grand-daughter of Lord Burleigh, the Queen's favourite, and Lord Treasurer; but, upon their sub∣mission by their proxies, were absolved from the cen∣sures incurred. The <HI>instrument</HI> sets forth, that, by their overlooking the authority of the church, they had all of them fallen under the greater excommunication, and the consequent penalties. About this time one Ed∣ward Squire was tried, condemned, and executed, for attempting the lives of the Queen and the Earl of Es∣sex, by sprinkling a poisonous powder on the pummel of her Majesty's saddle, and on his Lordship's chair. He had been persuaded to undertake this villainy by one Walpole a Jesuit in Spain, who had furnished him with the poison; and thinking that Squire had decei∣ved him, as the Queen and Essex continued in good health, sent over a person to inform against him.</P>
<P>A. D. 1601.] The convocation met this year on October 8; and the Archbishop presiding, exhorted the Bishops to manage with vigilance and vigour, and
<PB N="409" REF="442"/>be careful to observe the canons passed in the last con∣vocation. His Grace particularly gave them the sol∣lowing lowing cautions:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Not to proceed in court upon ap∣paritors suggestions, without churchwardens present∣ment, or other just inquisition:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That ecclesiastical judges hold no more than one court in the space of five weeks:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That chancellors and officials do not call men to several courts for the same cause:</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To have bills of presentment but once a quarter:</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the curates of non-residents be able persons, and have good allowances:</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That none but Chancellors grant li∣cences for marriage.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The difference betwixt the seculars and the Jesuits still continuing and increasing, Bishop Bancroft af∣forded the seculars countenance and maintenance in London house, furnishing them with necessaries to write against their adversaries, hoping the Protestants might assault the Romish cause with the greater advan∣tage by the breach made by their own dissentions.</P>
<P>In the parliament this year, it was enacted, that overseers of the poor should be nominated yearly, in Easter week, under the hand and seal of two justices of the peace; and that these, with the churchwardens, should take care of the poor, binding out apprentices, &amp;c. as also that the Lord Chancellor should award commissions under the great seal into any part of the realm, to the Bishop of every diocese, and his Chan∣cellor, &amp;c. to inquire by oaths of twelve men into the misemployment of any lands or goods given to pious uses.</P>
<P>A. D. 1602.] About this time Pope Clement VIII. perceiving the disputes between the English Jesuits and seculars was like to injure the Papal interest, wrote to the arch-priest Blackwell to stop the progress of the con∣test; to call in all defamatory books, and not to suf∣fer either party to maltreat the other; and that they should print nothing upon the controversy without a licence from the Cardinal Protector. A proclamation
<PB N="410" REF="443"/>was issued in October, ordering all the Jesuits, with such seculars as adhered to them, to depart the realm immediately; and the more moderate of the secular priests to be gone likewise, unless they would take the oath of allegiance. Camden represents the publishing of this proclamation as a kind of providence; since it prevented some dangerous practices of Winter and Tesmond, Jesuits, who had been sent from Spain to take measures for murdering the Queen, and exclu∣ding the King of Scotland from the succession.</P>
<P>A. D. 1603.] Elizabeth, who had all along been very happy in her health, now began to decline very sensibly. Her illness began to make a noise in the month of February: she had no formed fever, and her pulse was good; but she eat very little, could not sleep, and had a burning heat in her stomach, with a perpetual thirst and clamminess in her mouth, which made her drink frequently, to prevent being choaked by the dry and hot phlegm. She had used to be care∣ful of her health; but now she would take nothing, and refused all the medicines prescribed by her physi∣cians, declaring "she wished to die, and would live no longer." All agreed, that a deep melancholy, too strong to be either assuaged or diverted, was the cause of her illness; and it appeared in her looks and actions before she was seized with it. It was now time for her to declare her successor; a point she had always avoid∣ed, though she never varied in her resolution of trans∣mitting the crown to the King of Scotland. Some days before her decease, she told the Lord Admiral and Cecil in confidence, "that the crown of England was held by Kings succeeding in the order of their descent; that it ought not to go to riffraff mortals, but to her next immediate heir; and she owned no successor but the King of Scotland." These noblemen, on the day before her death, when her speech had failed, putting her in mind of what she had told them, and desiring her, in the presence of other Lords of the council, to
<PB N="411" REF="444"/>shew some sign of her confirming what she had said to them, she accordingly put her hand upon her head, in token of her approbation. There was no great danger of any dispute about the succession, the war with Spain having much hindered the intrigues of that court in fa∣vour of the Infanta, and there being no nobleman in England qualified, by his courage, ambition, under∣standing, and credit, to be the head of a party, except the Earl of Northumberland, who was heartily enga∣ged in King James's party. The Queen continued in a deplorable condition, sitting pensive for ten days to∣gether on cushions, without an hour's rest in all the time, till, on March 21, she was put into bed by force; and though she then seemed to be better, she still lay on her side, without speaking to or regarding any body. The Archbishop of Canterbury attending her on this occasion, she heard his exhortations, and joined in his prayers, with seeming great humility and devotion. On the 23d of that month she was speech∣less all the day; and having in the night got a conti∣nued sleep of five hours,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Queen Elizabeth's death and charac∣ter.</NOTE> waked only to die, in the calmest manner, and al∣most insensibly, about two o'clock next morning, in the 70th year of her age, and the 45th of her reign. Her corpse, without being opened or embalmed, was removed, on March 28, from Richmond to Whitehall; but her Majesty having given orders that it should not be touched or seen after her decease by any person but her own wo∣men, no body was suffered to see it; and it was inter∣red on Thursday, April 28, in the chapel of Henry VII. in Westminster-abbey, with great magnificence. Elizabeth, as to her person, was well made, hand∣some, strong limbed, rather tall than middle-sized; her forehead high and round, her eyes brown and lively, her complexion fair, her hair of a lightish yel∣low, her fingers long and taper, her voice clear and shrill; she had a fine set of teeth, and her outward
<PB N="412" REF="445"/>form was much set off by an air that was very agree∣able. After she came to the throne, whether she grew fonder of her own figure, or thought that Majesty re∣quired a sumptuousness of apparel, she laid aside that negligence which before she used in that respect, and wore constantly a dress exceeding rich, which she va∣ried according to the different fashions of Europe, as she fancied they best became her; a point she was very solicitous about. This humour did not leave her when she was past her grand climacteric; she dressed in her old age like a young girl; and still shone in her jewels, diamonds, and other precious stones, afraid of nothing so much as of being thought old: she liked flattery, especially on the subject of her beauty, however fulsome it appeared to every body else; was fond of being courted; and did not easily quit her favourites. Her memory was so good, that she never forgot any body she had once seen, and easily made herself mistress of various languages, ancient and modern, of the Greek and Dutch, so as to understand them well, and of the Latin, French, Italian, and Spanish, so as to speak them fluently. She had an admirable understanding, ready wit, great penetration, and a solid judgment. Her abilities for government were never questioned by any one; her application to public affairs was extraor∣dinary: but her prudence was in many cases the ef∣fect of a low cunning, and of the diffidence or jealousy of her nature, and her measures were often such as mo∣rality could not approve of, however politics might re∣present them as necessary. A profound dissimulation reigned in all her conduct and professions; nobody un∣derstood the art better, or practised it more constantly. She had no notion of generosity or magnanimity: nor was she, by inclination, either beneficent or magnifi∣cent; and, in a few instances, where she affected to appear so, her actions proceeded either from a view of interest, or for making a figure, and raising a reputa∣tion
<PB N="413" REF="446"/>abroad. The establishment of the church of Eng∣land, the reformation of the coin, the restoring of the naval force of the kingdom, the encouragement of commerce, the defeat of the invincible armada, and the reducing the formidable power of Spain, were the distinguishing glories of her reign. Though she was sometimes obliged to assert her prerogative, she treated her parliaments generally in an endearing manner, got from them all the supplies she wanted; and engaged them to bear the odium of the most cruel and arbitrary acts of her government, which, how evi∣dently soever the effect of her own private passions and malevolence, she would fain have thought to be done purely for the sake of her subjects and the safety of the kingdom. Her conduct towards the nobility was very different; jealous of their power, she employed very few of them in places of any trust or profit, and still fewer in her coun∣cils. Her choleric temper, which she indulged even in conferences with foreign ambassadors so, that they had no way of treating with her, but by bearing them easily, and flattering her in her humour, and which carried her to such violences, that the Ladies of her bed-chamber, and her maids of honour, often felt the weight of her hand, was perhaps another rea∣son why she did not care to employ the nobility: they were not tame enough in those days to bear such out∣rages. Her council was chiefly composed of persons raised by herself from an ordinary station in life, upon whom she could lay the blame of any odious action, and who would be more obsequious to her will; these were the men of her confidence, especially Burleigh and his son Sir Robert Cecil; to whom, whatever favourites she had, the whole management of affairs, from the beginning to the end of her reign, was intrusted. The ordinary way of raising fortunes for these privy-coun∣sellors was by plundering the church, and granting

<PB N="413" REF="449"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="414" REF="449"/>them manors belonging to episcopal sees, whether va∣cant or not. Corruption in the administration of justice was much greater in her time, than it had been former∣ly; the use of tortures to extort confessions of what the examiner pleased to suggest to the supposed criminals; the new kind of proofs allowed in courts for evidence to convict persons accused; the great encouragement given to informers; the spies planted in the families of the nobility and gentry, rendering their lives uncom∣fortable, and exposing them to continual dangers from their own servants; the number of pursuivants, roving from place to place, to watch people's words, and to take up all they were pleased to suspect; the patents for discovering the concealed lands of the crown, abused by the patentees to rob the church of its rights, and harrass the gentry; and the vast multitude of penal laws passed in her reign, more than in any of her pre∣decessors, will ever be deemed a reproach to her go∣vernment. The series of falshoods, hypocrify, and cruelty, appearing in all her conduct towards Mary Queen of Scotland, particularly in signing the warrant for her execution (though, all things considered, it was perhaps the gentlest part of that Princess's treat∣ment, whose fortitude under her sufferings, and espe∣cially at her death, contributed exceedingly to her glory, and to wipe off the load of infamy which had been so maliciously and unjustly thrown upon her) will be an eternal blot upon her memory. Elizabeth par∣doned rarely, and punished severely; being in her nature unforgiving, and inexorable. Her defects of mind were those for which the Tudor family was re∣markable; she was Henry VIII. in a female garb, actu∣ated by the same pride, the same furious transports of passion, the same mistrustful, jealous, and revengeful temper, the same wilfulness and obstinacy, and the same avarice. It was this last passion which made her fond of getting money any way, that would not disgust the body
<PB N="415" REF="450"/>of her subjects; every New-year's-day she received above 60,000 crowns in gifts and presents; and, when Sir Francis Drake was fighting for her service, in the last voyage he made to America, where he died, she seized a sum of 15,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which he had left in the Lord Mayor of London's keeping. Hence came the shameful plunder∣ing of bishoprics, and other ecclesiastical dignities, which were stripped of their best estates, under the colour of an unequal compensation in impropriations: and this niggardly temper was the cause of the loss of Havre de Grace, and that her fleets on the most im∣portant occasions, as in the engagement with the in∣vincible armada, and the expeditions to Spain and Portugal, were not supplied with ammunition and provisions adequate to the enterprizes they were sent upon. It was this avarice that subjected her to that censure of Sir Walter Raleigh, "that she did every thing by halves."</P>

<P>THE line of Henry VIII. being extinct in Eli∣zabeth, the crown of England devolved to the next lineal heir, the great-grandson of his eldest sister Margaret, James Stuart King of Scotland Four days before the death of Elizabeth, when the physi∣cians despaired of her recovery, the council had dis∣patched letters to convene the Bishops and Peers of the realm: and the summons was generally obeyed, ex∣cept

<P><NOTE PLACE="inter">King James proclaimed.</NOTE> Upon Elizabeth's demise at Richmond, the council then attending at that place, proclaimed King James; after which they came about eleven o'clock to Whitehall; and, meeting there with such of the Prelates and Nobility as had come to town upon their summons, agreed upon the form of a proclamation to be made in London, and sent over the kingdom. This proclamation was read at the gate of Whitehall, and at the cross of Cheapside, by Secretary Cecil, the heralds attending, and the peo∣ple receiving it with a wonderful unanimity, and an universal applause. That day Sir Charles Piercy, bro∣ther to the Earl of Northumberland, and Sir Thomas Somerset, son to the Earl of Worcester, were dispatch∣ed with letters to inform his Majesty of what had been done, and of the joy with which he would be received in his new kingdom, and to assure him of the readiness of the nobility to obey all his commands. He received the welcome news on March 26, and set out on Wed∣nesday, April 6, from Edinburgh, attended by some of the principal of the Scotch nobility: and, being magnificently entertained by several of the nobility and gentry on his journey, arrived at Theobald's (a house belonging to Sir Robert Cecil) on May 3, where the Lords of the council attended him. The coronation was celebrated in Westminster abbey, on Monday, July 25, being St. James's day; John Whitgift, Arch∣bishop of Canterbury, performing the ceremony of crowning and anointing both the King and Queen. The Romanists were not more disappointed than the Puritans, in their expectations of a toleration from
<PB N="417" REF="452"/>this King. These last founded their hopes in the King's being bred up among the Scotch Presbyterians; and they presented him a petition, in October, in the name of a thousand ministers, desiring an alteration in some parts of the liturgy, a reformation in some points of discipline, and an exemption from subscribing to the <HI>book of common prayer.</HI> The King and council, far from approving, rejected the petition with indignation: but as the deputies, that presented it, pressed much for leave to hold a disputation on the subject, the King appointed a conference for that purpose in the January following, 1604. The conferences was held for three days (January 14, 16, and 18,) at Hampton court: but with so little success on the Puritans side, that a proclamation was issued, on March 1, ordering the laws to be put in execution against all that did not con∣form, and declaring against all future alterations and innovations. This proclamation was preceded by an∣other, dated February 22, banishing all Jesuits, semi∣nary and other Romish priests, requiring them to quit the realm before March 19, and never to return, un∣der penalty of the laws being executed upon them with the utmost rigour.</P>
<P>The parliament met, on Monday, March 19, at West∣minster: and the King opened the session with a long speech; in which he recommended the union of the two realms, whose crowns were already united in his person; and, after exclaiming against the exorbitant power or claims of the Papacy, and expressing his a∣version to persecution, dclared the manner in which he intended to proceed both against the Roman Catholics and Puritans. Several bills were brought into the house of Commons this sessions in favour of the Puri∣tans, but they all miscarried. Richard Bancroft, Bishop of London, presided in the convocation; the see of Canterbury, to which he was soon after promo∣ted, being vacant by the death of Whitgift, on February 29; and a body of 141 canons, collected for the most

<PB N="418" REF="455"/>part out of the articles, injunctions, and synodical acts, during the reigns of Edward VI. and Elizabeth, was passed in it, and ratified by the King's letters patent, for the better exercise of the ecclesiastical discipline. The principal point was the putting them in execution: this the King enjoined, and the council pressed, re∣quiring a strict conformity to the rules of the church, according to the canons on that subject, and the act of uniformity. These orders, by Bancroft's care and ex∣ample, were so well observed, that the ministers were obliged either to quit their churches or to conform: and by the punishment of a few of their leaders, such a general terror was struck into the rest, that noncon∣formity grew out of fashion, in less time than can be easily imagined. About this time, James assumed the title of King of Great Britain, laying aside that of England and Scotland.</P>
<P>A. D. 1605]. This year is remarkable for that hor∣rid and diabolical conspiracy of the Papists, common∣ly called the <HI>powder plot;</HI> which was discovered by an anonymous letter to the Lord Monteagle, warning him from attending the parliament that was to meet on November 5. They had found means to convey into a vault under the parliament-house, about thirty-six barrels of powder, with an intent of blowing up the house, whilst the King made his speech at the opening of the parliament. The principal contriver was one Robert Catesby, a gentleman of good account in Northamptonshire. One Faux was apprehended in the outward room, with a dark lanthorn in his hand, and three matches, ready to give fire to the train<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Robert Catesby, Thomas Piercy, Sir Everard Digby, Francis Tresham, Thomas Winter, John Wright, Christopher Wright, Ambrose Rockwood, Robert Keys, Robert Winter, John Graunt, Thomas Bates (Catesby's servant) and Guido Faux. Of those who were executed, Sir Everard Digby, Robert Winter, Thomas Bates, Thomas Winter, Ambrose Rockwood, and Guido Faux, expressed great penitence for the crime: but none more than Henry Garnet, provincial of the English Jesuits, who suffered for concealing the conspiracy. The rest, who were executed, died with great obsti∣nacy.</NOTE>. The
<PB N="419" REF="456"/>conspirators were, most of them, taken and executed: and the memory of the deliverance was perpetuated by an act of parliament, in the beginning of the next year, 1606. This parliament enacted many things for the discovery and repressing of Popish recusants: where∣of none was more effectual than the <HI>oath of allegi∣ance,</HI> which every person was commanded to take. Paul V. hereupon dispatched two <HI>briefs</HI> into England, prohibiting all Catholics to take this oath, so destruc∣tive (as he alledged) to their own souls, and the see of Rome; exhorting them to suffer persecution, and manfully to endure martyrdom: notwithstanding which, the oath being tendered, was generally taken without any scruple.</P>
<P>A. D. 1607.] The new translation of the Bible was effectually set about this year by his Majesty's orders; and the translators, being forty-seven in number, were digested into six companies, several books being as∣signed them, according to the several places wherein they were to meet, confer, and consult together, so that nothing should pass without a general consent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Pentateuch, and the intervening books to the Chronicles, were allotted to Dr. Lancelot Andrews, afterwards Bishop of Winchester; Dr. John Overal, afterwards Bishop of Norwich; Dr. Laifield, who was employed chiefly on account of his sup∣posed skill in architecture, that he might give a clear description of the temple and tabernacle; Dr. Leigh, Archdeacon of Middle∣sex, and Parson of Alhallows, Barking, London; and Mr. Burley, Mr. King, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Bedwell, Vicar of Tottenham, near London. These met at Westminster. The translation of the four great Prophets, with the book of Lamentations, and the twelve lesser prophets, was committed to Dr. Harding, Dr. Reynolds, Dr. Holland, Dr. Kilby, Dr. Miles Smith, afterwards Bishop of Glou∣cester, Dr. Brett, and Mr. Fainlough. These assembled at Ox∣ford. The rest of the Old Testament, generally called the Hagio∣graphy, was intrusted to Mr. Edward Lively, Dr. Richardson, Dr. Chaderton, Mr. Dillingham, Dr. Andrews, brother to the Bishop of Winchester, Mr. Harrison, Mr. Spalding, and Mr. Bing. These convened at Cambridge. Dr. Duport, Dr. Branthwait, Dr. Rad∣cliffe, Dr. Ward, Mr. Downes, Mr. Boys, and Dr. Ward, translated the Apocrypha, and met at Cambridge. The four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Apocalypse or Revelations, were committed to Dr. Thomas Ravis, afterwards Bishop of London, Dr. George Abbot, in the sequel Primate of Canterbury, Dr. Eades, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Savil, Dr. Peryn, Dr. Ravens. and Mr. Harmer.

These met at Westminster.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>A. D. 1609.] No Prince had ever uniformity of re∣ligion more at heart than James; and he was particu∣larly attached to the constitution of the church of England. For refuting all errors and heresies repug∣nant thereto, he founded, this year, a college at Chel∣sea. It consisted of a provost, seventeen fellows, and two professors of history; all men eminent for learn∣ing, and provided with an handsome maintenance, that they might have leisure, as well as other conve∣niences, to employ their time entirely in the study of religious controversies, and in the defence of the re∣formation against Papists and Nonconformers.</P>
<P>A. D. 1610.] The laws against the Roman Catho∣lics were so severe, that it was not easy to find new ways of encreasing their severity: but the assassination of Henry IV. of France, happening about this time, raised such an indignation in the parliament, on ac∣count of its being perpetrated by a Popish enthusiast, that an act was passed this year for tendering the oath of allegiance to women recusants, and subjecting their husbands, either to the payment of ten pounds a month for their wives absence from church, or the se∣questration of a third part of their estates. This year the new translation of the Bible was published.</P>
<PB N="421" REF="458"/>
<P>A. D. 1612.] In March, one Bartholomew Legget was summoned before John King, Bishop of London, for denying the divinity of Jesus Christ, and a plurality of persons in the Deity. At his appearing he question∣ed the authority of the court, and persisting in his ob∣stinacy, was pronounced an incorrigible heretic, and delivered over to the secular magistrate. He was burnt in Smithfield. In the next month, Edward Whitman, of Burton upon Trent, was burned at Litchfield, for maintaining heterodox opinions.</P>
<P>A. D. 1617.] The King, having lately made a pro∣gress thro' Lancashire, observed that the excessive scruples of some magistrates and ministers, and their tying people up from all sort of relaxation on Sunday, had given the Papists occasion to misreport the church of England, as if no innocent recreation was allowed among the reformed: to prevent their gaining pro∣selytes upon this pretence, his Majesty published a de∣claration for allowing the people their usual recreations after divine service.</P>
<P>A. D. 1621.] This summer Archbishop Abbot, be∣ing invited by the Lord Zouch to kill a buck at his park at Bramzil in Hampshire, met with a calamitous misfortune; for shooting at a deer with a cross-bow, the keeper coming up unwarily too forward, was struck with the arrow under the left arm, and died about an hour after. The King, apprehensive that scandal might be given, ordered the case to be examined by commissioners whom he appointed. However, the Archbishop was not deprived; he gave 20 <ABBR>l</ABBR> a year to the man's widow, and kept a monthly fast on Tuesday, being the day of the week whereon the misfortune happened.</P>
<P>A. D. 1624.] The act of the 27th of Henry VIII. obliging the grantees of religious houses to maintain tillage, and keep on hospitality, was repealed by the parliament. The clashing between the English regu∣lars and seculars has been already related. To keep up
<PB N="422" REF="459"/>this difference, to give orders, and to keep the party better united, the seculars and Benedictines desired the Pope to put them under the government of a Bishop, Pope Urban VIII. consecrated Richard Smith, and sent him to England for that purpose.</P>
<P>A. D. 1625.] In the beginning of this year the King fell ill of an ague,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Death and character of K.

<P>UPON the decease of James, his only son Charles was, according to custom, proclaimed at Theo∣balds, in London, and elsewhere. The parliament and convocation being soon to meet, Bishop Laud was directed by his Majesty to consult the learned Bishop Andrews upon the juncture, and to take his advice what was fit to be debated on the subject of religion. The marriage agreed in the late reign, between his present Majesty and the French King's sister, was so∣lemnized
<PB N="423" REF="460"/>lemnized by proxy at Paris May 1; and on the 7th, the corpse of the late King was interred at Westmin∣ster in Henry VII.'s chapel, King Charles, in his own person, mournfully attending the funerals of his fa∣ther. Soon after his Majesty met the Queen at Dover, and conveyed her to London, after the consummation of the marriage at Canterbury. On the 18th of June the parliament met at Westminster, but nothing ma∣terial happened in it, except a remonstrance against the growth of Popery; to satisfy which the King wrote in December to the two Archbishops to perform their part for discovering and apprehending of Jesuits, and seminary priests, requiring them to proceed against Popish recusants by excommunication, and other cen∣sures of the church. The King, having summoned another parliament to meet on Feb. 6, 1626, resolved to proceed to his coronation before the session: the feast of the blessed Virgin was fixed on for this so∣lemnity. And for the better adjusting every part of the ceremony to the service and orders of the church of England, the King issued a commission to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and some other Bishops, to settle the form; which being done, Williams the Dean of Westminster being out of favour, Dr. William Laud was appointed in his stead to perform the Dean's part, in preparing for that pompous solemnity. And finding the old crucisix among the <HI>regalia,</HI> he placed it on the altar according to the antient usage. In the latter end of the late King's reign, Mr. Richard Mon∣tague had begun a controversy with the Roman Ca∣tholics in favour of the church of England; and, for some things he had advanced to distinguish her doc∣trine from the Calvinistical tenets, had been deeply censured by those of that party. They pretended he had deserted the church of England, and made dan∣gerous advances towards Popery and Arminianism. Montague, having procured a copy of an information they intended to lay before the next parliament, had
<PB N="424" REF="461"/>applied to the King for his protection. James, taking notice of the heat and clamour of Montague's adver∣saries, gave him leave to appeal to him, and make his desence in print. The tract was entitled <HI>Appello Caesarem:</HI> but that King dying before it was printed off, it was addressed to his successor. Montague had been summoned before the late parliament, and a censure passed on his writings; and now was summoned again, and his appeal to Caesar debated. This book being referred by the Commons to a committee, Mr. Pym made his report of several opinions extracted from it as erroneous; upon which the house resolved, "That Mr. Montague endeavoured to reconcile England to Rome, and alienate the King's affection from his well∣affected subjects." This is the first instance of a com∣mittee of religion in the house of Commons. It does not appear that this impeachment was laid before the house of Lords, nor in what manner the Commons intended to prosecute their charge, or how far they pro∣ceeded. Neither does it appear that Montague was brought to his defence, or that he returned any answer to the articles of the charge: from whence it may be concluded, that the process was dropped by the Com∣mons. The Commons complaint of the growth of Popery, and the King's letters to the Bishops and Judges, to prosecute <HI>recusants,</HI> looked like a storm coming from that quarter. The Pope, receiving ad∣vice of this unexpected turn, sent a consolatory letter to the English Roman Catholics. This Pope, like Paul V. seems to mistake the purport of the oath of allegiance; he takes it for granted that this test means more than a security for loyalty and civil obedience. Notwithstanding he recommends submission and pas∣sive obedience, lets them know, that they are not to apply to any expedients of violence, and that prayers and patience are the only defence Christian subjects are allowed to make use of.</P>
<PB N="425" REF="462"/>
<P>The deanery of the chapel royal being vacant by the death of Bishop Andrews, Laud was preferred to that station. He had observed an over ceremonious custom prevail through the late reign. When the King came into his closet to hear the sermon at cha∣pel, it was the custom to break off divine service, and sing the an hem, that the preacher might go into the pulpit. This was excessive respect, and looked as if the King came into the house of God to be wor∣shipped. Laud therefore entreated his Majesty to be present at the Liturgy, as well as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rmon; and that, at whatever part of the prayers the King came in, the priest might proceed to the end of the service. The King consented; so far from bring disconcerted, that he thanked the Bishop for so pious a suggestion.</P>
<P>A. D. 1628.] On the 7th of March a new parlia∣ment met at Westminster. This parliament, to shew their concern for religion, brought in a bill "for re∣formation of sundry abuses committed on the Lord's day." There was a statute to this purpose made in the first year of this reign; which was sortified and extended by the present parliament. The Commons brought in a charge against Dr Manwaring for preach∣ing arbitrary doctrine. He had lately, in two sermons before the King at Whitehall, delivered himself very indiscreetly to this purpose. "That the King is not bound to preserve the subjects in their legal rights and liberties: that his royal will and absolute command, in imposing loans and taxes, though without the con∣sent of the parliament, ought to be obeyed by the subject under the penalty of eternal damnation: that those who refused to comply, transgressed the law of God, and incurred the guilt of impiety, disloyalty and rebellion." The Commons, by their Speaker, de∣manded judgment of the Lords against him; upon which they gave sentence, "that he should be im∣prisoned during pleasure, fined in a thousand pounds, suspended for three years from the exercise of the mi∣nistry,
<PB N="426" REF="463"/>make his submission, and his sermons should be burnt." About this time the Commons addressed the King with a remonstrance, shewing, "That they had reason to apprehend a secret design of introducing a change in religion: that it was the visible increase of Popery, and the particular countenance received at court, which occasioned that jealousy; and that the minds of his subjects were further alarmed by his Ma∣jesty's letters for stopping legal proceedings against Papists, &amp;c." This address was not well received by his Majesty. However, the Commons went to draw an∣other remonstrance against tonnage and poundage. Upon which the King prorogued them to the 20th of January; and thus the presenting it was prevented. His Majesty published an answer to the first remon∣strance: it was drawn up by Laud; who, soon after the recess of parliament, was translated from Bath and Wells, to London: and Montague was pro∣moted to the see of Chichester. At the confirma∣tion of Bishops, there is public notice given, that if any persons can object against the party elected, or the legality of the election, they are to come and offer their exceptions at the day prefixed. This inti∣mation being given, one Jones, a bookseller, attended with a mob, appearing at the confirmation, excepted against Montague, as a person unqualified for the episcopal dignity. But his exceptions being neither given in writing by an advocate, nor presented by any proctor of the court (these being material circumstan∣ces) the confirmation went on: and, to set Montague out of the reach of these cavils, he was consecrated two days after at Croydon.</P>
<P>After the murder of the Duke of Buckingham, who was stabbed by one Felton at Portsmouth, Dr. Laud seemed to fill his room in the King's esteem, and had a considerable direction of affairs both in church and state. In order to silence the con∣troversy between the Calvinists and Arminians, he
<PB N="427" REF="464"/>procured the reprinting of the nine and thirty articles, with the King's declaration prefixed at the head of them. The Calvinists complained loudly of this de∣claration, and drew up an address, which they intended to present to the King, for recalling it: but this was stopped in its passage, and never reached his Majesty. In the interval of the session, the King thought proper to suppress Dr. Manwaring's sermons, by proclama∣tion: and Montague's appeal to Caesar, as being thought the first occasion of these controversies, were called in; all persons, who had any of these books in their possession, being ordered to deliver them to the Bishop of the diocese. However, to secure Monta∣gue from further trouble, and relieve Manwaring a little under the parliamentary sentence, they had both his Majesty's pardon; and Manwaring, notwithstand∣ing the sentence of the Lords had disabled him from promotion, was presented to a rectorship, and after∣wards made Bishop of St. David's. The preferring this gentleman, who had recanted in form, was far from being acceptable, It seemed like partiality to the prerogative, and made the parliament more warm at their next meeting, and the King lose ground in the affection of his subjects.</P>
<P>A. D. 1629.] At the meeting of the parliament, the Commons concerned themselves about controver∣sies of religion, pronounced upon the sense of the thirty-nine articles, and seemed to clash with the King's declaration. Pursuant to a speech of Pym's, wherein he complains of innovations in religion, &amp;c. the com∣mittee except to the pardons of Montague and Man∣waring, complain of Richard Neal Bishop of Win∣chester for procuring them, and pronounce an Armi∣nian the spawn of a Papist. And thus the humour beginning to run high in the lower house against the court, the King dissolved the parliament, on March the 10th. Laud, who had now the ascendant at court, being sensible that the discipline and revenues of the
<PB N="428" REF="465"/>church were mismanaged, and out of order, was in∣tent upon providing a remedy. To this purpose he consulted Samuel Harsenet Archbishop of York; and these two threw their scheme into ten articles, and pre∣sented them to the King. This draught was signed by his Majesty, and published under the title of his "Instructions to the most Reverend Father in God, George Lord Archbishop of Canterbury."</P>
<P>A. D. 1630.] In Lent, John Davenant Bishop of Sarum preaching before the King, happened to touch on the quinquarticular controversy, which gave great offence to the King. The Bishop's text was out of Romans vi. 3. <HI>Eternal life is the gist of God, through jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> The third head of his sermon was, that the godly are happy in the manner of their reward, because the eternal life bestowed upon them is <HI>donum gratuitum,</HI> or free and unmerited bounty. From this proposition he considered eternal life under three respects; <HI>that is, in the eternal destination thereof, which we call free election.</HI> This being the passage which gave offence, the Bishop's apology was, "that the doctrine of predestination was not forbidden by the King's de∣claration, because it establishes all the nine and thirty articles, amongst which that of predestination is one." The Lords of the council told him, that it was his Ma∣jesty's pleasure that these mysterious questions should not be debated. He replied, he was sorry he did not know his Majesty's mind, and that for the future he would govern himself accordingly. Upon this he was dismissed without farther trouble, and afterwards ad∣mitted to kiss the King's hand, who told him, the doctrine of predestination was too big for the people's understanding, and that the preaching reformation and good life would be much more serviceable to the au∣dience.</P>
<P>A. D. 1633.] Archbishop Abbot dying this year, August 4, Laud succeeded him in the see of Canter∣bury. The first directions he received from court re∣ferred
<PB N="429" REF="466"/>to the business of ordinations. To secure the clergy from indigence and dependance, it was provided by the canons, that none should be ordained without a title. A title for maintenance is thus settled by the church; the person to be ordained must either exhibit his presentation to some benefice within the diocese of the Bishop ordaining, or bring an unquestionable cer∣tificate of his being provided of a curacy in the said diocese, or that he is assured of officiating as deacon or priest in some cathedral or collegiate church, or that he can make proof of his being a fellow or chaplain in some college in Oxford or Cambridge, or that he is five years standing master of arts, and lives in one of the universities upon his own charges; or, lastly, the Bishop who ordains him shall engage to prefer him shortly to some cure then void.</P>
<P>About this time the King published a declaration for allowing of lawful sports on the Lord's day. This declaration, whether upon the score of indulging too much liberty, or dispensing with a late act of parlia∣ment, was not well received, and gave the people a further disgust to the administration. Some of the clergy, who scrupled the reading of it in their church∣es, were suspended by the ordinaries, and prosecuted in the high commission. These rigours, though not very common, heightened the complaints, and disser∣ved the government both in church and state<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On June 18, his Majesty was crowned King of Scotland at Holyroodhouse by John Spottiswood, Archbishop of St. Andrew's.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A. D. 1634.] this year the clergy of London pe∣titioned the King for the benefit of the law, and the due payment of their tithes; which pecition was gra∣ciously received, and several of the privy council were appointed to examine it: however, it came to nothing. This year also the Archbishop of Canterbury began his metropolitical visitation in the diocese of Lincoln; and, in the first place, John Williams, the Bishop,
<PB N="430" REF="467"/>and the six Archdeacons, were suspended the exercise of their jurisdiction during the time of their visitation. The bringing the communion-table into the chancel, which situation had been long discontinued in several places, occasioned a warm contest both in this diocese and elsewhere. The churchwardens were now ordered to remove the communion table to the east end of the chancel, and inclose it with a decent rail; it having been inclosed in the middle by order of Williams, the then Bishop of that diocese.</P>
<P>A. D. 1635.] In July, a proclamation was publish∣ed against profane swearing and cursing, pursuant to an act in the late reign. An office was likewise erected for receiving the penalty of the statute, and the mo∣ney arising from thence was to be paid to the respec∣tive Bishops, and distributed among the poor where the offender dwelt.</P>
<P>A. D. 1636.] At this time a controversy happened between the Archbishop and the two universities, con∣cerning the right of visitation. The Archbishop claimed a right of visiting upon the privilege of his see. The universities, on the other side, alledged, that this jurisdiction was vested in the King, upon the score of being their founder. The cause was brought before the council-board, his Majesty being present, to hear and determine the debate, which was decided in favour of the Archbishop. This year Pryn, Bastwick, and Burton, were tried in the high-commission court for libelling the hierarchy, and were sentenced next year in the star-chamber to pay a fine of five thousand pounds each, and to suffer perpetual imprisonment, after ha∣ving their ears cut off in the pillory. Pryn had lost part of his four years before, for a like offence: how∣ever, he had no abatement in his punishment for that misfortune, but was sentenced to lose the remainder, and be marked on both cheeks with the letters <HI>S</HI> and <HI>L,</HI> signifying a seditious libeller.</P>
<PB N="431" REF="468"/>
<P>The Roman Catholics were not all this time negli∣gent of their interest. About two years before this, Panzani, the Pope's agent, came to London; part of his business being to discover, whether the King would permit those of his communion a Catholic Bishop of the English nation: and, to make the motion pass the better, they were contented this Bishop should be no∣minated by his Majesty, and not exercise his function but under such limitations as the King should pre∣scribe. Upon this request, a query was put to Pan∣zani, "Whether the Pope would allow the nomina∣ting such a Bishop as held the oath of allegiance a law∣ful engagement? and whether his Holiness would give the English of his communion leave to take the oath?" Panzani, finding himself somewhat embarrassed in the question, declared he had no commission to speak to that matter. Upon this disappointment, he went low∣er in his request, and, by some correspondence at court, moved the King, that the Queen might be permitted an agent from the Pope, for directing her spiritual af∣fairs. The King, by the advice of his council, con∣descended to the motion, upon condition that the par∣ty sent should be no priest. Panzani, having conti∣nued in England two years, returned to Rome, leaving Seignior Con, a Scotchman, in his stead; who, being a person of dexterity and address, worked himself into a conversation with some of the ministry, and endea∣voured to get acquainted with Laud. But the Arch∣bishop having no good opinion of him, or his business, would not so much as admit of a visit of ceremony. However, by the King's connivance, and the Queen's favour, the Papists came somewhat forward, appeared in greater numbers at court, and frequented their de∣votions at Somerset-house, with more freedom than formerly. This being observed, the blame was chiefly laid upon Laud; and several libels were scattered in London, reflecting on him, as an encourager of the mass, and little better than the Pope's pensioner. Wal∣ter
<PB N="432" REF="469"/>Montague, a younger son of the Earl of Manche∣ster, and Sir Toby Matthews, son of the late Arch∣bishop of York, had been very active in their mission, and, amongst others, had lately converted the Coun∣tess of Newport. The Archbishop finding himself at∣tacked with calumny, took this opportunity to dis∣prove the imputations. Being at the council-table, he addressed himself to the King, and in a full discourse acquainted his Majesty with the growth of the Roman Catholic interest; that the Papists met frequently at Somerset-house; and that Montague and Matthews had taken unsufferable liberties, practised upon his Majesty's subjects, and particularly upon those within the verge of the court. This speech being well re∣ceived by the King, Montague and Matthews were ordered to retire.</P>
<P>A. D. 1639.] In the diocese of Exeter, one Cox preached a sermon upon Hosea iv. 4. to prove that the church of England did not maintain the calling of Bishops to be <HI>jure divino;</HI> which made an ill impression upon a great many people in those parts. But the Bishop of Exeter having discoursed this Cox, sent him up to the Archbishop; where receiving full satisfac∣tion upon the question, he went home and, of his own voluntary motion, made a handsome recantation, and recovered the people he had formerly misled.</P>
<P>A. D. 1640.] The late troubles in Scotland, and the King's indulgence to the covenanters, animated the faction in England; the times grew disturbed, and the faction was greatly embarrassed. To relieve the King under these difficulties, the Earl of Stafford, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Marquis of Ha∣milton, advised his Majesty to call a parliament; it was likewise resolved at the board, to give an extraor∣dinary assistance, in case the house should prove in∣compliant, and refuse the passing of subsidies. The parliament met at Westminster, on April 13: soon after the opening of the session the King sent a message
<PB N="433" REF="470"/>to the lower house, to put them in mind of sup∣plies; reporting the intolerable usage he had received from the Scots; and declaring, that provided they granted him an aid suitable to the occasion, he would give up his claim of <HI>ship-money,</HI> and satisfy all other reasonable demands. But the commons, as things were managed, were in no disposition for compliance; they insisted upon farther securities for property, for better settlement of religion, and for privilege of par∣liament. The question was, whether the King's mes∣sage, or the Commons request, was first to be consi∣dered? After several conferences between the two houses, the Lords voted a preference to the King's business, and the Commons to that of the subject. But the dispute was quickly ended, no less unfortunately than it began: for Secretary Vane, being ordered to acquaint the Commons in what proportion the King de∣sired to be assisted, proposed twelve subsidies; whereas, it was said, he had express orders to mention no more than six. This being looked on as an excessive demand, shocked the Commons, and put them quite out of tem∣per: so that proceeding to some unacceptable debates, the King, despairing of any good issue, dissolved the parliament. However, the convocation still continu∣ed sitting, having received a commission from under the broad seal, for altering the canons, or making new ones. Archbishop Laud brought in one "for sup∣pressing the farther growth of Popery." A canon was drawn "for the better keeping the day of his Majesty's inauguration:" and another was levelled against the spreading of the Socinian heresy. The next provision was a restraint of <HI>sectaries:</HI> by which canon it was de∣creed, that all those proceedings and penalties mention∣ed in the canon against Popish recusants, should, as far as they are applicable, stand in full force and vigour, against all Anabaptists, Brownists, Separatists, Fami∣lists, or other sects whatsoever, who refuse repairing to
<PB N="434" REF="471"/>their parish-churches for hearing divine service, and re∣ceiving the holy communion.</P>
<P>Thus far the convocation had gone when the par∣liament was unfortunately dissolved: notwithstanding of which they went on with their business, though the prospect was dark, and the juncture very discouraging: for five hundred of the mob had lately made a march to Lambeth, and attacked the Archbishop's palace two hours: but being disappointed in their malice, and forced to retire, they resolved to assault the con∣vocation. The King being informed of the danger, appointed them a guard, consisting of some companies of the train bands of Middlesex, commanded by En∣dymion Porter, a well-affected gentleman. The canons afterwards passed in this convocation are as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. An oath enjoined for the preventing of all innova∣tions in doctrine and government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A declaration concerning some rites and ceremonites.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Of preach∣ing for conformity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. One book of articles of en∣quiry to be used at all parochial visitations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Concerning the conversation of the clergy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Chan∣cellors patents.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Chancellors alone not to censure any of the clergy in sundry cases.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Excommuni∣cation, and absolution, not to be pronounced but by a priest.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. Concerning the commutations, and the disposing of them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. Concerning some concurrent jurisdictions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. Concerning licences to marry: and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>12. Against vexatious citations.</ITEM>
</LIST>
These canons were all unanimously subscribed by the convocation, Godfrey Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, excepted. Before their subscription they were read before the King and Privy-Council; the Judges, and other eminent persons of the long robe, being present. They were approved by the whole audience, the King giving the Archbishop thanks for bringing things to so good an issue. After this solemn approbation they were sub∣scribed in the upper house by the Bishops, and the rest of the clergy, none refusing to put their hand but
<PB N="435" REF="472"/>the Bishop of Gloucester. This Prelate's firmness to the reformation had been formerly questioned, which suspicion was increased by this refusal; for it was thought the strictness of the canon for suppressing the growth of Popery, was the only reason of his standing off. He was first argued with, and then required to acquiesce, by his Metropolitan: but these methods proving ineffectual, he was suspended <HI>ab officio et be∣neficio</HI> by both houses. The sentence being put into form, signed by the Archbishop, and publickly pro∣nounced, his Majesty ordered his commitment. But this durance was but short; for on the 10th of July he acknowledged his misbehaviour before the Lords of the council, and took the oath enjoined by the sixth canon, upon which he recovered his liberty. These canons were greatly complained of: but it appears, that the guarding the government, the pinning the sub∣jects so close to their duty, and declaring so strongly against rebellion, was the great grievance in them.</P>
<P>The King having lately marched against the Scots, a paper was dropped in Covent Garden, to encourage the apprentices and soldiers to attack the Archbishop: but, one of the mob having been executed for the late attempt on Lambeth, they had not courage enough to renew the enterprize. But not long after, when the high commission sat at St. Paul's, about two thousand Brownists insulted the court, pulled down all the benches in the consistory, and cried out they would have no Bishops nor High Commission. The King, by this tumult, was put to the expence of a guard for St. Paul's, as he had been for Westminster before.</P>
<P>On the 3d of November, the long parlia∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Long par∣liament meets.</NOTE> which proved so fatal to the King, met at Westminster. At the opening this session, the Commons made speeches against the crown, and the church, in a very remarkable man∣ner; and gave early indications of what followed. The Earl of Strafford, who commanded the English
<PB N="436" REF="473"/>army, came up to London, at the King's instance, and ventured himself with the parliament. This, both by himself, and his friends, was thought a step somewhat too hardy. But the caution was over-ruled by his Majesty, who promised his protection, and re∣fused to dispense with his absence at the <HI>council-board.</HI> However, this nobleman's apprehensions of danger were too well founded; for, upon his appearing in the house, he was impeached for high treason by the Com∣mons, committed to the black rod, and sent to the Tower soon after. The government being now in a visible declension, Burton and Prynne got loose from their confinement, and made a pompous entry into London; being attended from Brentford with several thousands of horse and foot, with rosemary in their hats. Thus the King's courts of justice, which had censured these men, were openly insulted: and the criminals were admitted to the house of Commons, to prefer petitions against the prosecutors. By this coun∣tenance the Puritan faction was further animated to at∣tack the church, Alderman Pennington, with a re∣tinue of some hundreds, came to the house of Com∣mons, and presented a petition subscribed by fifteen thousand Londoners, tho' not in the name of the cor∣poration. This paper exhibited a strong complaint against the ceremonies and discipline of the church of England: but, containing too much matter for sudden dispatch, it was postponed to a time of more leisure, Upon December 15, the Commons attacked the late convocation in form, and resolved, <HI>nullo contradicente,</HI> "1. That the clergy of England, convened in any convocation, or synod, or otherwise, have no power to make any constitutions, or acts, whatever, in mat∣ters of doctrine, discipline, or otherwise, to bind the clergy or laity of the land, without common consent of parliament. 2. That the several constitutions and canons ecclesiastical, treated upon by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, Presidents of the convoca∣tion
<PB N="437" REF="474"/>for the respective provinces of Canterbury and York, and the rest of the Bishops and clergy of those provinces, and agreed upon with the King's Majesty's licence, in their several synods begun at London and York in 1640, do not bind the clergy or laity of this land, or either of them." The next day, the same subject being resumed, it was resolved, <HI>nullo contradicente,</HI> "1. That these canons, above-mentioned, do con∣tain in them many matters contrary to the King's pre∣rogative, to the fundamental laws and statutes of this realm, to the rights of parliament, to the property and liberty of the subject; and matters tending to sedition, and of dangerous consequence. 2. That the several grants of the benevolences, or contributions granted to his most excellent Majesty, by the clergy of the pro∣vinces of Canterbury and York, in the several convo∣cations or synods holden at Canterbury and York, A. D. 1640, are contrary to the laws, and ought not to bind the clergy." The next day Mr. Denzil Hol∣lis was sent up from the lower house to the Lords, with an impeachment of high treason against Archbishop Laud: upon which he was committed to the black rod, and continued under that restraint till the 1st of March next year, when he was sent to the Tower. The dis∣cipline of the church sinking with the Archbishop, about fourscore Anabaptists, meeting at a house in St. Saviour's, Southwark, preached that the 35th of Eli∣zabeth, enjoining the use of the <HI>common prayer,</HI> was no legal statute, because the Bishops concurred to the making of it. From hence they advanced to the crown, asserting, that the King cannot make a good law, because not <HI>perfectly regenerate;</HI> and that he is only to be obeyed in matters relating to the state. Up∣on their being brought before the Lords, they con∣fessed the articles, but were dismissed without punish∣ment.</P>
<P>A. D. 1641.] On March 10, a bill was brought into the house of Commons, and passed, "That no
<PB N="438" REF="475"/>Bishop should have any vote in parliament, any judi∣cial power in the star-chamber, or any authority in temporal affairs; and that no clergy man should be in the commission of the peace. This bill had many abettors in the house of Lords, where it was afterwards thrown out. The Earl of Strafford was now brought to his trial. Several articles were brought against him; but that which lay hardest upon him was, his advising the King, as it was pretended, to bring over the Irish army to reduce this kingdom to obedience. These words were said to be spoken at the council-board, when the dissolution of the last parliament was resolved on. The charge was supported only by a single evidence, and contradicted by the rest of the cabinet; and Secre∣tary Vane, this evidence, had twice deposed before that he knew nothing of the matter. The Lord Digby, tho' one of the committee for preparing matter for, and managing the trial of the Earl, was so affected with the disproof of this grand article, that he solemnly wash∣ed his hands of Strafford's blood, and refused to concur with the bill. The Commons distrusting the force of their evidence, and being apprehensive the Earl would be acquitted by his Peers, changed their battery, and proceeded by way of attainder. The Bishops moved to be excused from being present on the trial. The bill passed with the Commons, but found more oppo∣sition from the upper house: till the mob, counte∣nanced by the Earl of Strafford's enemies, came down to the parliament-house in formidable numbers, and insulted the Lords, by crying <HI>Justice, justice;</HI> and either frightened them from the house, or overawed the ma∣jority into a compliance. Notwithstanding the opi∣nions of the Judges, Bishops, &amp;c. that it was neces∣sary to appease the people, and for the preservation of himself and family, that the King should give his as∣sent to the bill, nothing could prevail on his Majesty to consent to it. To set his conscience at liberty, the Earl very generously wrote him a letter to persuade his
<PB N="439" REF="476"/>compliance; and declared himself willing to resign his life, rather than keep up a misunderstanding between the King and his subjects. The King at last gave a commission to the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord Cham∣berlain, and several others, to pass the attainder: and, at the same time, he signed another destructive act, for continuing the session as long as the parliament should think fit. Thus the parliament had some colour, tho' no law, for pushing things to an extremity, and levy∣ing men and money against the government. Had not this act been passed, the King might have scattered them at discretion; and in case they had been so hardy as to have sat after a dissolution, they would have wanted a varnish to cover their coarse complexion, and the revolt would have been more legible and uncontest∣ed: The Earl of Strafford was executed soon after, and suffered with great calmness and resignation, professing himself innocent in the intents and purposes of his heart of what he died for, and praying God would for∣give those who contrived his death.</P>
<P>A design was now forming in the parliament for lopping the revenues of the church, and suppressing the deaneries and chapters. The clergy, endeavouring to break this proposal, ordered one in each cathedral to come up, and solicit their friends in either house: they drew a petition to the Lords and Commons, but it was never presented: they likewise retained counsel, and instructed them with heads to plead on. But be∣ing informed, that the house would not allow them the benefit of the long robe; and that, if they had any thing to suggest, they must appear and plead their own cause, they made choice of Dr. John Hacket, Pre∣bendary of St. Paul's, and Archdeacon of Bedford, for their council. This Gentleman, being admitted to the bar of the house of Commons, made a very ju∣dicious speech, which so affected the house, that had the alienation of the lands been then put to the question, it is thought it would have gone in the negative, by a
<PB N="440" REF="477"/>great majority. A bill brought up from the Commons to the Lords, against Bishops and clergymen, consist∣ing of several branches, was voted by parts. The branches were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That they should have no votes in parliament.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That they should not be in the com∣mission of the peace, nor Judges in temporal courts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That they should neither sit in the Star-chamber, or be privy counsellors.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The universities perceiving the cathedrals in danger, and the encouragement of learn∣ing struck at, addressed the parliament upon the sub∣ject. A bill for taking away the <HI>high commission</HI> was sent up to the house of Lords, on June 24, passed there, and was soon after signed by the King: and the court of star-chamber was also put down soon after.</P>
<P>The Bishops interest failing in the upper house, the Commons resolved to push the opportunity: and they were not only struck at in the parliamentary privilege, but in their spiritual character. They presented a re∣monstrance to his Majesty on that subject, but did not receive an answer to their liking. Notwithstanding this disappointment, they resolved to follow their blow. The bill for taking away the Bishops votes was brought in for another trial, and the house carried it for excluding the Bishops. To decline the odium of innovating thus openly upon the constitu∣tion, and discharging one branch of the three estates from any share in the legislature, some endeavours had lately been used to persuade the Bishops to gratify the importunity of the Commons, and to give up their right of sitting in parliament. But they had too much direction and courage to betray their interest, and throw up their peerage. This business, though now in agitation, was not finished till two months after∣wards. In the mean time, to succeed against this re∣pulse, and batter the resolution of the Lords Spiritual, the apprentices were drawn down to Westminster, to assist the faction, and overawe the prelatic party.
<PB N="441" REF="478"/>These auxiliaries came to the parliament-doors in great bodies, and cried, <HI>No Bishops.</HI> From hence they ad∣vanced to downright railing and insulting their persons, throwing stones at them; so that they could not come to the house, either by land or water, without appa∣rent hazard of their lives. The rabble, thus encou∣raged, made an assault upon Westminster-abbey; and some of them owned their design was to pull down the organs, and deface the monuments. John Williams, then Archbishop of York, to prevent this horrible ravage, and secure the <HI>regalia</HI> from being seized, made fast the doors, and maintained the abbey against them. The two houses taking no notice of this tumult, the rioters continuing in the same phrenzy and outrage, and the Bishops going to the parliament-house being altogether impracticable, they met at the Dean of Westminster's lodgings, and subscribed a protestation for preserving their right of sitting in parliament. It was drawn up by Archbishop Williams in the form of a petition, and was to be presented to his Majesty in the house of Peers. Five of the sees being vacant, and some of the Bishops gone down into the country, it was only signed by twelve, viz. The Archbishop of York, the Bishops of Durham, Litchfield, Norwich, St. Asaph, Bath and Wells, Hereford, Oxford, Ely, Gloucester, Peterborough, and Landaff. This pro∣testation was put into the Lord Keeper Littleton's hand, but not to be read, till the King, at the Bishops instance, came into the house of Peers. But he, con∣trary to direction, communicated the affair to some unfriendly members of both houses before the time. Immediately, upon reading the paper in the upper house, the anti-epicopal Lords desired a conference with the Commons. The petition being put into their hands, the Lord Keeper declared the protestation con∣tained "matters of high and dangerous consequence, and intrenched upon the fundamental privileges and being of the parliament." The Commons resolved to
<PB N="442" REF="479"/>seize the opportunity, and within half an hour after they had the instrument, they sent up to the Lords, and, without farther debate, impeached the twelve Bishops, who signed the protestation, of high treason. This charge being carried to the upper house by Mr. Glyn, the black rod was immediately ordered to go in search of the Bishops, and bring them forthwith before the Lords. They appeared at the bar that evening, and were committed to the Tower: all except the Bishops of Durham, Coventry, and Litchfield, who, in regard of their age, and ill health, had the favour of being re∣mitted to the custody of the Gentleman Usher. About a fortnight after, they were severally brought to the bar of the house of Lords, and put in their answers to the impeachment in the following form. "I—Bishop of—saving to myself all advantages of exception to the insufficiency of the said impeachment, for myself, say, that I am not guilty of the treason charged by the said impeachment, in manner and form as the same is therein charged." After this answer, the Bishops peti∣tioned the house of Lords, for trial or bail; and the Lords assigned them the twenty-fifth of January for their trial, remanding them in the mean time to their for∣mer confinement, where they continued till the be∣ginning of the next year; at which time the Lords ad∣mitted them to bail. They lived where they pleased, without ever being called to a trial; which is a clear proof they had done nothing unwarrantable by law; for had they been any way obnoxious, their enemies would not have failed in their prosecutions.</P>
<P>A. D. 1642.] The mask was now laid aside, the anti-episcopalians appeared more in their colours. Pe∣titions from different counties were delivered to the house of Commons, praying that the Popish Lords and Bishops votes may be taken away. The bill before-mentioned, against the Bishops, passed the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nse in the beginning of February: and, the same d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, they sent to the King, then at Windsor, to press for his consent. This message was seconded by those
<PB N="443" REF="480"/>of greatest trust about the King, and he was at last prevailed with to pass the bill.</P>
<P>At length the tumults increased so much, that his Majesty thought proper to retire into Yorkshire, and prepare for his own defence. During his stay, the remarkable <HI>nineteen propositions</HI> were sent by the two houses. The eighth of these propositions, relating to the church, desired, "That his Majesty would be pleased to consent to such a reformation, of the church∣government and liturgy, as both houses of parliament should advise; and that for this purpose they intended to consult with divines, as was expressed in their decla∣ration. On the other hand, numbers of petitions were sent both to the King and parliament in favour of episcopacy. And now, the two houses having seized the magazines, and places of strength, the war began, and the rebellion flamed out. After several skirmishes, the parliament forces fought the King's at Edgehill with some disadvantage. Immediately after this battle, the King reduced Banbury castle, marched towards London as far as Brentford, and, after some successes, countermarched to Oxford, for winter∣quarters.</P>
<P>A. D. 1643.] Before the next campaign was opened, the King received, from the parliament, some proposi∣tions towards an accommodation: but they came to no∣thing. Though the two houses had no concession from the King to warrant their proceedings, they passed an or∣dinance to sequester the Bishops, and other delinquents estates. By delinquents was meant, those who declared for the King, and refused to join in the rebellion. The rents and profits of the sees and capitular bodies, which lay within the reach of the parliament army, were seized, and the rest of the loyal clergy were sequestered under the character of scandalous ministers. And now most of the silenced lecturers, and other preachers, who, with in the last ten years, had left the kingdom for noncor formity, debt, &amp;c. returned about this juncture. The
<PB N="444" REF="481"/>men were preferred to the sequestered benefices; but, to keep them servile and true to the cause, they were but like tenants at will, and held their living only <HI>du∣rante bene placito.</HI> The King, acquainted with the oppression, and illegal proceedings, published a pro∣clamation against them: but, though this shewed his Majesty's care to protect the loyal clergy, it had no effect to stop the persecution. Besides their attacking the hierarchy in their reputation, the parliament played a more effectual battery against the church, and exe∣cuted their design already mentioned of <HI>consulting</HI> godly, religious, and learned divines. For this pur∣pose they did not think fit to wait his Majesty's plea∣sure, but, upon the return of their commissioners from Oxford, convened an assembly by their own authority.</P>
<P>The summoning of this assembly, by the parlia∣ment, was a new provocation to his Majesty, and an unprecedented incroachment upon the royal prero∣gative. And, besides the illegality of the meeting, it was mostly made up of persons disaffected to the church: and, which was a farther reason for just ex∣ception, the divines were intermixed with secular men; and, in case of any difference, the two houses were the last judges of the controversy. Upon these conside∣rations, the King published his proclamation, before the sitting of this extraordinary synod, "prohibiting all persons, mentioned in that pretended ordinance, the as∣sembling for that purpose, declares the assembly illegal; that no acts done by them ought to be received by the subject; and that the allowing the assembly men wages, by a tax upon the public, was an unheard-of presumption." Notwithstanding this proclamation, sixty-nine, of the hundred and twenty nominated, met at the time and place appointed. On the first of July, pursuant to the ordinance, these divines met in king Henry VII.'s chapel. The assembly was opened with a sermon, preached by their prolocutor Dr. Twisse, both houses of parliament being present. One of their first acts,
<PB N="445" REF="482"/>was a petition to the parliament, for a solemn fast, on account of the late defeats of their forces in the North and in the West<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Waller had been beaten in the West, by the King and Lord Fairfax, in the North by the Earl of Newcastle.</NOTE>. This petition was well approved, and a public fast was ordered upon Friday following.</P>
<P>Amongst other calumnies now thrown upon the King, the rebels misrepresented his religion, and re∣ported him inclined to Popery; which they knew would prove a significant aspersion, and disincline the people to his service. His Majesty therefore, to un∣deceive his subjects in that particular, made a solemn declaration of his belief; for being ready to receive the holy eucharist, from the hands of the Lord Pri∣mate Usher, he rose from his knees, and, giving the Archbishop a sign for a short pause, spoke thus: "My Lord, I espy here many resolved Protestants, who may declare to the world the resolution I do now make. I have, to the utmost of my power, prepared my soul to become a worthy receiver: and may I so receive comfort by the blessed sacraments, as I do in∣tend the establishment of the true, reformed, Pro∣testant religion, as it stood in its beauty in the happy days of Queen Elizabeth, without any connivance at Popery. I bless God, that, in the midst of these public distractions, I have still liberty to communicate; and may this sacrament be my damnation, if my heart doth not join with my lips in this protestation." That this purgation was seasonable, may be collected from a pamphlet published sometime before by one Salt∣marsh, where, amongst other directions, he advises "to cherish the war under the notion of combating Popery;" for this was the surest means to engage the people. Two more of his suggestions were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. That all means should be used to keep the King and his people from a sudden union;" and,</ITEM>
<ITEM>"2. If the King would not grant their demands, then to root him out, and the royal line, and transfer the crown
<PB N="446" REF="483"/>upon somebody else."</ITEM>
</LIST>
This desperate advice was read in the house of Commons.</P>
<P>The successes of the King's arms struck such a terror, that the leading members were preparing to retire beyond sea: and had the Earl of Newcastle, instead of sitting down before Hull, marched into the associated counties, and had the King at the same time omitted the siege of Gloucester, and made for London, the war, in all likelihood, had been at an end. But the parliament, gaining time by the mis∣conduct of the royalists, applied to the Scotch for assistance, and, engaging with them in their covenant, and supplying them with a hundred thousand pounds, prevailed on them to enter England with a great army.</P>
<P>A. D. 1644.] This summer, after the battle at Marston Moor, in which the King's forces were de∣feated, the assembly of divines communicated a letter to the parliament, which they received from the Kirk of Scotland. It was a sort of remonstrance against the dilatory proceedings in settling the church-govern∣ment in England. This expostulation was not without effect; for soon after the assembly had leave to draw up a form for <HI>ordination</HI> of ministers, and debating the settlement of the church. In October, an ordinance was passed, touching <HI>ordination.</HI> By this provision, some assembly-men of distinction, and certain London ministers, were empowered to <HI>lay their hands</HI> upon such persons as they found qualified for the holy ministry. Archbishop Laud, having been three years imprisoned, was brought to his trial this year, on March 12; which was not ended till the month of October: when the houses thought fit to proceed by way of attainder. The bill passed with the Commons, November 16, but it was much longer before the Lords concurred to it: but they were obliged at last by menaces to agree to it. The Archbishop was beheaded, on January 10, 1645, on Tower-hill: and suffered with great forti∣tude, calmness, and resignation.</P>
<PB N="447" REF="484"/>
<P>An ordinance had passed, the day of the Arch∣bishop's attainder, for laying aside the <HI>common prayer,</HI> and using the <HI>directory</HI> instead of it. This <HI>directory,</HI> drawn by the assembly of divines, was transmitted in parts to the parliament; where, after a debate in both houses, it was confirmed, with some small alterations. In the latter end of January, commissioners were sent from the King, and parliament, to Uxbridge, to en∣deavour an accommodation: but, after several days debate, the treaty broke up. The parliament, en∣couraged by their late victory at Naseby, repeated their ordinance for putting the directory in execution, with penalties upon those who refused to comply, or made use of the common prayer. The King, in No∣vember, published a counter-proclamation to this ordinance, in which he strictly injoined the use of the common prayer, and charged the directory with open∣ing a liberty to ignorance and faction.</P>
<P>There had been for some time two different parties in the parliament, the Presbyterians and Independants. These latter had moved for a toleration, and, being now grown stronger, a committee was appointed for an accommodation. The two houses having spent several months in drawing proposals to be sent to his Majesty touching a peace, the Scotch commissioners excepted against part of the draught; especially the subjecting church-assemblies to the controulment and decision of the parliament, and depriving them of great part of their ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Notwith∣standing this remonstrance, the two houses were un∣willing to come under any restraints, or part with their spiritual empire.</P>
<P>A. D. 1646.] The parliament seems to have been afraid of the Scotch discipline, and of being fettered too much in their interest, their pride, or their plea∣sures. However, the King, now incapable to keep the field, retiring to the Scotch army, and casting himself upon the duty and honour of that party, the
<PB N="448" REF="485"/>two houses thought it necessary to come towards a compliance. The Scotch, having the advantage of the King's person in their army, were not to be too much provoked. They therefore passed an ordinance for the "present settling of the Presbyterian govern∣ment," without delay. The King, being now at Newcastle with the Scotch army, had a conference with Mr. Alexander Henderson, one of the Scotch divines, about church-matters. The English com∣missioners, being informed how well his Majesty had performed against Mr. Henderson, declined engaging in any dispute, and only desired his answer to their propositions; but these were so unreasonable that the King could give them no satisfaction. In October following the parliament made an ordinance, for abo∣lishing the name, dignity, and function, of all Arch∣bishops and Bishops, alienated their lands, and settled them in trustees; and, not long after, ordered them to be sold for the payment of debts, and discharging the public faith. It is probable the new preachers ex∣pected to have raised their fortunes upon the ruins of episcopacy, and had their livings augmented with Deans and Chapters lands. But now they found themselves disappointed, the alienations transferred to secular uses, and the plunder lodged in other men's coffers. Be∣sides, the parliament had agreed to pay the Scotch 400,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> of arrears, for the delivering up his Ma∣jesty, and wanted to raise the money.</P>
<P>A. D. 1647.] The Presbyterian party had now dis∣abled the King in the field, got him in their custody at Holmby, routed the regular clergy, and procured a settlement of discipline from the two houses. When they had surmounted so many difficulties, and thought their prosperity established, they met with an unlooked∣for misfortune. For the parliament having brought the war to an end, and dismissed the Scotch, resolved to disband a great part of the army. But these mea∣sures were by no means acceptable to the general
<PB N="449" REF="486"/>officers. They were altogether unwilling to quit their command, and lose the advantage of so much hazard and fatigue. Therefore they declared against disbanding, and marched their forces towards Lon∣don, contrary to the orders of parliament. After this they proceeded more directly towards a rupture, and impeached eleven members of the house of Com∣mons of high treason: and, being sensible how ser∣viceable the King's person would be to them, they sent Cornet Joyce, with a party of horse, to bring his Majesty to their head-quarters at Wooburn in Bed∣fordshire. Joyce executed his commission, and suc∣ceeded in the attempt, without meeting any resistance. And thus they who had embroiled the kingdom, kindled and carried on a calamitous war, after having thrown their country into this misery and convulsion, met with nothing but disappointment; for now the Independants made themselves masters both of church and state.</P>
<P>The parliament being informed of the army's nearer advance towards London, both the Speaker and several members fled, and, on August 7, the General and the army marched in triumph through the city. His Ma∣jesty being ordered to Hampton-court, and his children allowed to be with him, the Commons, on September 28, considered of several propositions to be sent to his Majesty. On November 11, the King made an escape from Hampton-court: but, on October 15, informa∣tion was brought to the house, that his Majesty was safe at the Isle of Wight, and had put himself under the protection of Colonel Hammond, then governor of the island. The Presbyterian party of the two houses, who were willing to preserve the King, prevailed so far as to send commissioners down, and propose an accom∣modation. When the treaty broke up, the commis∣sioners made their report at Westminster; and his Majesty's concessions, though very great, were voted unsatisfactory. However, being afraid of the army,
<PB N="450" REF="487"/>they resumed the debate, and, after a long struggle, resolved, that the King's compliance was a ground to proceed on for the settlement of the nation. But they were now in no condition to go on with an accommo∣dation: for the army now made loud remonstrances against it, and having seized and imprisoned several members of the lower house, overawed the rest of the Presbyterian party. In 1648, the Independants being the majority, the Commons retract their former vote, and come to a contrary resolution. In short, the King is removed from Carisbrook to Hurst Castle; from thence conveyed by the army to Windsor, and from thence to London. And now they laid the mask aside, and discovered their intentions. The King was treated without ceremony, the marks of sovereign respect forbidden, and a committee appointed by the Com∣mons to draw up a charge of high treason against him. This insolent impeachment was unanimously rejected by the Peers, who then adjourned. Upon this the Commons declared themselves the supreme power, shut up the house of Lords, and went on without them. In 1649, a high court was erected in West∣minster-Hall for the trial of the King. When his Majesty was brought before them, he denied the au∣thority of the court, argued against their impudence, and behaved like a great Prince. Upon his refusing to plead, they condemned him to be beheaded. This unparalleled outrage of Majesty, and the constitution, struck the Presbyterian party with horror. These men, though they had been zealous in the revolt, and preached up the war against the King, had no inten∣tion of going this hideous length. Therefore, when they found the King's trial resolved by the rump, they made a strong remonstrance against it.</P>
<P>On the 28th of January at night, Juxon Bishop of London was admitted to assist his Majesty in his de∣votions: and on Tuesday following, January 30, the execrable murder was committed on the side of
<PB N="451" REF="488"/>the side of the Banquetting house at Whitehall. The King appeared on the scaffold undisturbed in aspect and motion, supported his character to the last minute, and declared himself of the communion of the church of England, as it was left him by his father James. Thus died Charles I. a Prince of great abilities, equal and dispassionate in his temper, and remarkably regular in his private life. He never entered on his diversions abroad, till he had first paid his duty to God at the public prayers. He was likewise very strict in observ∣ing the hours for his cabinet-devotion; and would not allow any licentious jests, any rallying of religion, though ever so much recommended by pleasantry and wit. He was well furnished with capacity and resolu∣tion to advise at the council-board, and execute in the field. Two of his greatest misfortunes seem to have been a blind uxoriousness and an excess of clemency: he had likewise too modest a sense of his own judg∣ment and sufficiency: which diffidence made him sometimes over-ruled by other mens opinions worse grounded than his own. The extent of his knowledge, the force of his reasoning, and the nobleness of his manner, is sufficiently discovered in his printed works. The beautiful turn and lustre of his compositions are seldom met with in English authors of that age. The Lord Chancellor Clarendon, who knew him very well, gives him the character of the worthiest gentleman, the best master, the best friend, the best husband, the best father, and the best christian, that the age in which he lived produced. He left issue three sons, Charles Prince of Wales, James Duke of York, and Henry Duke of Gloucester, who died soon after the restoration. His daughters were, the Princess Mary, married to the Prince of Orange; Elizabeth, who died during the usurpation at Carisbrook castle; and Hen∣rietra, married to the Duke of Orleans.</P>
<P>The Prince of Wales was at the Hague when his father was murdered; and the parliament forbade the
<PB N="452" REF="489"/>proclaiming him under the penalty of high treason. They vote the house of Lords useless and dangerous, giving the Peers liberty to sit in the house of Com∣mons, provided they were elected. The rump parlia∣ment, now at the helm, proceed to abolish kingly authority, and chuse a council of state, with whom they lodge the executive part of the government. They then repeal the oaths of allegiance and supre∣macy. Thus when the rebels had made themselves liable to the highest forfeitures, by a continued breach upon these laws, they thought it necessary to take them out of the way.</P>
<P>On April 10, an act was passed by the Commons, for the sale of Deans and Chapters lands, and for the abolishing of Deans and Chapters, Canons, Prebends, &amp;c. and tithes of or belonging to any cathedral, or collegiate church in England and Wales: but it was provided, that this should not extend to the college of St. Mary's in Winchester, nor to that of Eaton. About this time, some fanaticks in the army called Levellers, being encouraged by the extravagant in∣dulging of opinions, and flourishing upon the liberty of the subject, made an address to the rump for ge∣neral freedom. They desired "they might be restored to the privileges of Adam's descendants; that some of the restraints of property might be taken off, and the earth made common to industry, that every body's labour might furnish them freely with the conveniences of cloaths and diet; that the incumbrances of paying rent and doing homage to a fellow creature of their own might be no longer suffered; and that the mask of servitude and tyranny being thus taken out of the way, all people might live at ease, and enjoy the benefit of their creation" everal acts passed in the pretended parliament, this summer, to keep on the mask of re∣formation, against licentiousness, blasphemies, and exe∣crable opinions: and an act passed for the better main∣tenance of preaching ministers and schoolmasters (out
<PB N="453" REF="490"/>of the lands of Deans and Chapters) throughout Eng∣land and Wales, in such places where maintenance is wanting.</P>
<P>Cromwell still more distinguished himself in the army; and was, this summer, sent over commander in chief of the parliament forces for Ireland (then almost reduced to the King's obedience by the Marquis of Or∣mond) with title of Lord Governor of that kingdom. His Majesty being at Jersey, part of the English fleet was sent in July to attack that island: upon which the King removed into France; where he resided till the time appointed for a treaty with the Scots at Breda, when he repaired thither.</P>
<P>A. D. 1650.] This summer the King landed in Scot∣land, and was proclaimed immediately at Edinburgh cross: but the kirk, not finding the King compliant with all their extravagant demands, set up for them∣selves. In short, his Majesty's houshold is purged, and most of the Royalists obliged to leave the country. The commonwealth of England now made Cromwell commander in chief of their forces, their General Fair∣fax having resigned, and ordered him to march into Scotland, to check the commotions there; which he performed with such success, owing to their own divi∣sions, that, by the latter end of the year, he was master of all the south part of the country. In the mean time the King was crowned at Scoon in Scotland, with the usual ceremony and magnificence.</P>
<P>A. D. 1651.] The Scotch Royalists and Covenan∣ters being now tolerably reconciled, his Majesty ap∣peared at the head of a considerable army in that coun∣try; and, after having tried his fortune to some dis∣advantage with Cromwell, entered England by way of Carlisle, held on his march to Worcester, and entered that town. Cromwell and Lambert coming up, with a much superior army, a decisive battle was fought, on September 3; where his Majesty's troops, being over∣powered
<PB N="454" REF="491"/>with numbers, were after a stout resistance de∣feated: after which the King lay concealed for some time, and with much difficulty got himself transported over to France.</P>
<P>A. D. 1653.] Cromwell, now strengthened in his interest, and elated with a course of victory, grew weary of the rump parliament. These men lying in the way of his ambitious designs, he resolved to make a bold push: and, having concerted the design with his officers, he marched to the parliament-house with some troops, placed a guard at the door, and entered with a file of musqueteers. His manner of address was suit∣able to his military appearance; for, with an air of haughtiness and passion, he commanded the Speaker to leave the chair, told the house "they had sate long enough unless they had done more good," bid one of his soldiers "take away that fool's bauble, the mace," staid till the house was empty, and then ordered the doors to be locked. The assembly of divines, who had grown less and less for some time, and dwindled to a committee, were now entirely disabled and sunk with this long parliament. The first usurpation being thus melted down, Cromwell cast it in a new mould of his own contriving. After some days of humiliation, and solemn pretences of seeking God, he issued out circular letters to a select number of his own creatures, to take upon them the government of the common∣wealth. This was called <HI>Barebone's parliament.</HI> These members, for a proof of their zeal and capacity, vote down tythes, discourage the ministry, harrass the uni∣versities, and run to the last extremes of folly and ex∣travagance. This causing great murmurs without doors, the enthusiasts were apprehensive they might be called to an account, quitted their posts, and resigned the go∣vernment to Cromwell, who accepted it, under the title of Lord Protector.</P>
<P>A. D. 1654.] Being now seated in his Protector's chair, Cromwell summoned a pretended parliament.
<PB N="455" REF="492"/>These members passed an act for settling a committee of <HI>Triers,</HI> for the approbation of public preachers. Those who were admitted to any benefice or lecture, were obliged to pass the test of this committee. Their next statute provides for removing scandalous and in∣sufficient ministers and schoolmasters; that is, those who had continued firm to the church and crown. However, these usurpers did not plunder and perse∣cute without some resemblance of compassi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n: for, by the act, a fifth part of the benefice is allowed to the wives and children of the ejected ministers.</P>
<P>A. D. 1655.] In the beginning of this year, the pretended parliament, grasping at the sole administra∣tion, and endeavouring to recover their former sway, was dissolved by Cromwell.</P>
<P>A. D. 1656.] This year James Naylor, and some others imprisoned at Bristol, being charged with blas∣phemy, the house ordered a committee to send for them, and examine the witnesses. Naylor was ac∣cordingly brought to the bar of the house: and, upon hearing the cause, they resolved him a grand impostor, and guilty of horrid blasphemy. They sentenced him to stand two hours in the pillory at Westminster, to be whipt from thence to the Old Exchange by the com∣mon executioner, and there to have his punishment in the pillory repeated; his tongue bored thro' with a hot iron, and his forehead branded with the letter B, with some other circumstances of correction.</P>
<P>A. D. 1658.] Cromwell was taken sick, in August, at Hampton Court: after a week's time, his disease began to shew very desperate symptoms; and, having declared his son Richard his successor, he died on Friday, Sep∣tember 3, at three o'clock in the afternoon. After Cromwell's death, the usurpation appeared more float∣ing, frequently shifted posture, and rolled thro' seve∣ral forms till the restoration. Richard, having sat at the helm about half a-year, was laid aside, and the rump parliament revived in 1659. But they were
<PB N="456" REF="493"/>quickly displaced by Lambert, Fleetwood, and some other officers of rank: who put down the rump's council of state, and settled a commission of safety: but the administration rested not long in their hands. Upon petitions from several parts of the kingdom for a free parliament, the rump recovered: and, in the be∣ginning of the next year, General Monk, who had been treating with some agents from his Majesty, marched out of Scotland with his army, and came to London, in 1660, admitted the secluded members, and soon after dissolved the long parliament. A council of state was formed, and the Lords and Com∣mons assembled at Westminster. These Lords and Gentlemen recollecting the miserable unsettled state of the kingdom, and the generality of people being tired with the anarchy and confusion, which the late dissen∣tions had occasioned, the juncture seemed favourable for the restoration of the kingly power. On April 27, Sir John Grenville presented the General with a com∣mission from his Majesty, constituting him Captain General of all the armies of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and a letter for the council of state, with a declaration of his Majesty's touching a free liberty of conscience in matters of religion. Monk, coming to the parliament or convention, produced the letter and declaration, which, being read, gave great satisfac∣tion; and the houses voted, that, according to the antient and fundamental laws of this kingdom, the government is, and ought to be, by King, Lords and Commons. Hereupon several members of both houses are dispatched to his Majesty, with an invitation to come over, and take possession of the government. His Majesty was at the Hague when these messengers waited on him; and after having been some days splen∣didly treated by the states, he embarked on board the English fleet, arrived at Dover, and was received by the kingdom with all imaginable marks of duty and inclination.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the <HI>STATE</HI> of <HI>RELIGION</HI> in <HI>ENGLAND</HI> from the Re∣storation in <HI>1660,</HI> to the Revolution in <HI>1689.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CHARLES was in the thirtieth year of his age when he took possession of the throne. He had taken pains in cultivating his understanding; and was well acquainted with the history and politics of the most remarkable states in Europe. He possessed a natural fund of humour and vivacity, together with the most insinuating address and power of pleasing in conversa∣tion. The first public act he passed was an act of in∣demnity, those only excepted who had been immedi∣ately concerned in the late murder. Having adjourned the parliament, his Majesty published a proclamation on the subject of religion, directing the Bishops how to exercise their spiritual jurisdiction; ordaining that a certain number of theologists should be chosen to re∣view and alter the liturgy; and that no person should, in the mean time, be obliged to conform. Nine of the old Bishops, still living, were restored to their dio∣ceses. Bishoprics and benefices were offered to the most distinguished Presbyterian ministers; but they were refused by all except Edward Reynolds, who be∣came Bishop of Norwich.</P>
<P>A. D. 1661.] In the beginning of January one Ven∣ner, a desperate enthusiast, and fifth-monarchy-man, appeared in the streets of London at the head of three∣score fanatics compleatly armed, and proclaimed King Jesus. They slew a man because he declared himself for God and King Charles. They believed themselves in∣vulnerable,
<PB N="458" REF="495"/>made a desperate resistance against the train-bands sent to quell them, and retreated to Kane∣wood near Hampstead. Being dislodged from thence in the morning, they returned to London, and took pos∣session of a house, in which they defended themselves until the greatest part of them were killed. The survi∣vors were taken, tried, condemned, and executed; and affirmed to the last, that if they had been deceived, the Lord himself was their deceiver. Some Presbyte∣rian ministers, finding themselves confounded with o∣ther sectaries whom they abhorred, intreated the King to give order for a conference between them and the Bishops, that both sides might candidly examine their objections to the English liturgy. Charles complied with their request: one and twenty ecclesiastics were nominated on each side, and the conferences were be∣gun in the house of the Bishop of London, who lived in the Savoy. The Bishops would not offer such an indignity to the church as to make the least concession to this stubborn sect; and the Presbyterians exclaimed against the liturgy, and the surplice, as relicks of the church of Rome. After an obstinate dispute and virulent altercation, they parted, more than ever irritated a∣gainst each other.</P>
<P>A. D. 1662.] The King, sending for the Commons to Whitehall,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Act of U∣niformity.</NOTE> expressed uncommon zeal for the church of England, gave them to un∣derstand, that he had sent the book of Com∣mon Prayer to the Lords, with his approbation of some changes which the convocation had thought pro∣per to make in it, that it might be more suitable to an act of uniformity, which he desired the lower house might prepare without passion or precipitation. The Commons were resolved to manifest their obedience. On the nineteenth of May, the King gave his assent to the act for establishing uniformity in public worship, and in the administration of the sacraments. By this statute, which began to be in force on St. Bartholo∣mew's
<PB N="459" REF="496"/>day, every minister was obliged to conform to the worship of the English church, according to the book of Common Prayer lately revived, and to sign a declaration, approving of that ritual; to take the oath of canonical obedience, abjure the <HI>solemn league and covenant,</HI> and acknowledge his detestation of the prin∣ciples of taking up arms against the King, or those acting by his commission, on any pretence whatsoever. He was likewise restrained from administering the sa∣craments, unless he had been previously ordained by a Bishop. When the act of Uniformity took place, two thousand Presbyterian ministers chose rather to resign their benefices than subscribe the articles. In order to mitigate in some measure the severity of this act, the King issued a declaration, promising to use his influ∣ence with the parliament, to concur in passing a law by which he might be enabled more fully to exert his dis∣pensing power in favour of those who, from consci∣entious motives, could not comply with the act of U∣niformity. This was intended as a preliminary to a general toleration, the benefit of which might extend to the Catholics, to whom the King had a secret pro∣pensity. The Presbyterians, thinking themselves un∣justly oppressed, petitioned the King and council, that they might be exempted from the penalties specified in the act of Uniformity; and his Majesty published a proclamation, declaring, that, though he adhered with all his heart to that act, nevertheless, out of regard to some of his subjects, he was willing to dispense with their observing certain articles therein contained.</P>
<P>A. D. 1663.] The Commons, alarmed at the de∣claration for indulgence, in which the King assumed a dispensing power, and that too in order to weaken the force of the law which they had enacted, presented an address against it. They enumerated the inconve∣niences which might arise from a toleration; and proposed, as the most effectual method to prevent schisms, troubles, and divisions, that the laws should
<PB N="460" REF="497"/>be executed for the support of the established religion, according to the act of uniformity. Charles, finding his designs so disagreeable to the Commons, thought proper to postpone it to a more favourable opportu∣nity.</P>
<P>A. D. 1665.] This year the parliament passed the famous <HI>five mile act,</HI> by which every non-conforming preacher was banished five miles from the place where he had been minister, after the act of indemnity, un∣less he would take the oath of non-resistance.</P>
<P>A. D. 1666.] This period is remarkable for the dreadful fire of London, imputed, and upon the strongest grounds, to the malice of the Roman Catholics.</P>
<P>A. D. 1669.] Whether Charles was willing to re∣concile himself to the Presbyterians, who constituted a powerful body in the nation, or the Duke of Buck∣ingham, who had now great influence in the council, resolved to forward a step which he knew would be disagreeable to the Duke of Ormond, whom he hated, uncommon favour was now shewn to that sect, which had been so much depressed since the restoration. They appeared more openly, and even ventured to assemble at their religious worship. Sir Orlando Bridgeman sent for two of their ministers, and consulted them about means for comprehending the Presbyterians in the body of the English church, as well as for pro∣curing an indulgence for Independents and other Non∣conformists. These two ministers, having conferred with a like number of the English church, after several meetings, and various disputes, agreed, that, with respect to ordination, all Non-conformists already or∣dained might be admitted into the ministry of the church, by virtue of this form, "Take thou legal authority to preach the word of God, and administer the holy sacraments in any congregation in England, where thou shall be lawfully appointed thereto." They likewise agreed, that ceremonies should be left indiffe∣rent: that the liturgy should be altered: that those
<PB N="461" REF="498"/>who could not be comprehended should be indulged: and that, for the security of the government, the names of the teachers, and all the members of the congregations, should be registered. The Lord Chief Justice Hales undertook to draw up a bill for this purpose, and the keeper of the great seal promised to support it in parliament with his whole interest. Gilbert Sheldon Archbishop of Canterbury, being apprised of their design, wrote a circular letter to all his suffragans, enjoining them to make an exact in∣quiry touching all the conventicles that were held within their respective dioceses. Having received all the information he could procure on the subject, he exaggerated every circumstance to the King; and ob∣tained, from his easy disposition, a proclamation, or∣dering the laws against non-conforming ministers to be put in execution. Nevertheless, Charles gave the leading Presbyterians to understand, that he had designs in their favour; and desired they would present a peti∣tion to him for indulgence. The house of Commons thanked the King, in an address, for the proclamation he had published against conventicles, and appointed a committee to make exact inquiry concerning the con∣duct of the Non-conformists. These having received a great number of informations, reported, that divers conventicles and seditious assemblies were held in the neighbourhood of the parliament, so as to insult the government, and endanger the public tranquillity: upon which the house declared, that they would adhere to his Majesty for the support of the government in church and state against all sorts of adversaries.</P>
<P>A. D. 1670.] The Lords and Commons jointly pe∣tioned his Majesty, that he would give effectual orders for suppressing conventicles, and executing the laws against Popish recusants. Charles, though in his own nature averse to persecution, was too irresolute to withstand the zeal of his parliament; and therefore gave his assent to an act, which declared an assembly, consisting of seventeen persons, a conventicle, provided
<PB N="462" REF="499"/>they met to worship God in any other form than that which was practised in the church of England; even though ten of that number should belong to the fa∣mily in whose house they might be assembled. Every individual was fined in five shillings for the first offence, and ten for the second. The preacher was condemned in twenty pounds for the first conviction, and in double that sum for the next; and a fine of twenty pounds were decreed against the person in whose house they should be found assembled.</P>
<P>A. D. 1672.] A war breaking out this year with the Dutch, the King thought it necessary to quiet the minds of his people, and set them at ease in matters of religion. To that end, and probably with a view to favour the Roman Catholics, his Majesty published a declaration in March, suspending the penal laws against Non-conformists, indulging the Protestant Dissenters with the public exercise of their religion, and allowing the Catholics to worship God after their own way in private.</P>
<P>A. D. 1673.] The court were mistaken in thinking by this declaration for liberty of conscience to secure the Presbyterian interest; for that party suspected that the drift was, under shelter of them, to favour the Roman Catholics. Alderman Love, one of the chiefs of the Presbyterian party, spake in the house with great spirit against the declaration; and his disinte∣rested behaviour upon this occasion made such impres∣sion on the Commons, that they brought in a bill for the relief of Protestant Non-conformists: it passed the lower house without opposition; but the Lords pro∣posed some amendments, with which the Commons would not comply; and, before the affair could be compromised, the King prorogued the parliament. In the mean time the Lords and Commons addressed the King against the Roman Catholics, desiring that the laws might be vigorously executed against Priests and Jesuits: that all officers, and persons in public employ∣ments
<PB N="463" REF="500"/>in the army, should take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and receive the communion accord∣ing to the form of the church of England. His Ma∣jesty published a proclamation to that effect, and was at last prevailed on, in order to appease them, to send for the declaration, and break the seal affixed to it, with his own hand. Soon after the parliament passed the famous <HI>test act,</HI> importing that every person in office or employment, should take the oaths of alle∣giance and supremacy; receive the sacraments in some parish-church before competent witnesses, and subscribe a declaration, renouncing all belief of the real pre∣sence in the encharist.</P>
<P>A. D. 1675.] The late measures of the court had raised such a spirit of opposition in the Commons, that many members of the upper house, and especially the Bishops, began to dread the revival of the republican spirit. In order to prevent the mischiefs which might arise from such a flame, Robert Bertie, Earl of Lind∣sey, brought into the house of Lords a test bill, for imposing upon all persons, in ecclesiastical, civil, or military, employments, as well as upon privy coun∣sellors and members of parliament, an oath renouncing the lawfulness of resisting the King, or those acting under his commission, on any pretence whatsoever; but a dispute arising between the Lords and Commons, on account of an appeal brought before the Lords by Dr. Shirley against Sir John Tagg, a member of the house of Commons, the bill was dropped.</P>
<P>A. D. 1677.] A bill passed both houses, and re∣ceived the royal assent, for taking away the writ <HI>de Heretico Comburendo.</HI> This year is remarkable for Oates's narrative of a plot, said to be carried on by the Jesuits, and other Roman Catholics, against his Ma∣jesty's life, the Protestant religion, and the govern∣ment of the kingdom. As the evidences were all men of profligate character, the truth of whose depositions in several respects were flatly disproved by numbers of
<PB N="464" REF="501"/>creditable witnesses, it appears to have been only a villainous imposture, raised by a set of abandoned mis∣creants, for the most infamous purposes: however, such was the prejudice of the people, that it raised an universal ferment, and operated in defiance of com∣mon sense and demonstration. Numbers of persons were executed on the accusation of these wretches, all protesting solemnly, at their last moments, their inno∣cence of what they suffered for.</P>
<P>A. D. 1683.] This period is remarkable for a con∣spiracy to assassinate the King in his way to New-Market, at a place called the <HI>Rye house;</HI> which was discovered by Keiling, one of the conspirators. Seve∣ral noblemen and gentlemen, that were concerned in this affair, suffered death, amongst whom were the Lord Russel, and the famous Alg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnon Sidney.</P>
<P>A. D. 1685.] His Majesty was seized suddenly with an apoplectic fit,<NOTE PLACE="inter">Death of Charles <HI>II.</HI></NOTE>, and, after languishing a few days, died on February 6, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his actual reign, from the restoration. Not∣withstanding the errors in this Prince's conduct, and the blemishes in his character, he was personally be∣loved by his people, who were overwhelmed with grief and astonishment at his death. This sorrow and surprise co-operating with the terror of his successor, and the detestation of Popery, ingendered a suspicion of his having been taken off by poison; but this, upon enquiry, appeared without foundation. During his illness he received the sacrament from the hands of a Catholic priest, and died in that communion.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REIGN OF JAMES II.</HEAD>
<P>A. D. 1685.] Charles dying without legitimate issue, his brother James Duke of York was proclaimed King without any shadow of opposition. On the first day of his reign he assembled the council at White∣hall.
<PB N="465" REF="502"/>He disclaimed arbitrary principles, declared that he would maintain the religion established by law, and defend the liberties of the people. He and his Queen were crowned on April 23; when some people obser∣ved that the royal diadem was too large for his head, and shook from side to side, a circumstance from which they deduced a bad omen. The parliament being assembled, the King in his speech confirmed his assurances of maintaining the established religion, and the liberties of the people. The two houses made an address of thanks upon the occasion, and granted him large supplies for his present emergencies. This year the Earl of Argyle raised an insurrection in Scotland; and the Duke of Monmouth landed in the West of England, and soon after assumed the title of King: but they were both suppressed, and beheaded, and a great many of their adherents suffered death. Nothing could be more flourishing than the King's present situation. He had quelled two dangerous rebellions; trampled faction under foot; and obtained a parlia∣ment that complied with his desires. He had a stand∣ing army at his command; heard the doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance echoed from every corner as articles of the English creed; and found himself courted by foreign states. But he had no∣thing so much at heart as the conversion of his people to the Romish religion. His own zeal was reinforced by the importunities of some hot-brained Jesuits, who had acquired the most absolute influence over his conscience.</P>
<P>A. D. 1686.] The King now admitted four Popish Lords into his council, viz. the Lords Arundel of Wardour, Bellasis, Dover, and the Earl of Tyrconnel. The Roman worship was publickly performed, and the Jesuits erected colleges in different parts of the king∣dom. Four Catholic Bishops, consecrated in the King's chapel, were sent through the kingdom, to exercise their episcopal functions, under the title of
<PB N="466" REF="503"/>apostolic vicars. The monks appeared at court in the habits of their orders; and a great number of priests and friers arrived in England. The whole ad∣ministration was now managed by real or time-serving Catholics. The King sent a circular letter to the Bishops, ordering them to prohibit the inferior clergy from preaching on points of controversy. But this injunction was very little regarded by the Protestant divines, who, seeing their religion in such imminent danger, exposed the errors and absurdities of the Romish communion, with such learning, energy, and candour, as operated powerfully on the conviction of the public, and redounded to their own immortal honour. The King and his council were so dipleased with these endeavours, that they were resolved to esta∣blish a new <HI>ecclesiastical commission court,</HI> that should en∣force obedience. This was accordingly instituted, and composed of secular as well as ecclesiastical members, among whom were some Catholics. They were em∣powered to exercise all sorts of ecclesiastical jurisdic∣tion; to correct abuses in the spiritual law, inquire into all offences, punish delinquents by censure, ex∣communication, suspension and deposition; to examine statutes, rules, and charters of colleges, and other ecclesiastical communities; and make such corrections and alterations as they should think proper. Henry Compton Bishop of London, being summoned before the new ecclesiastical court, declined their jurisdic∣tion, affirming that, as a Bishop, he was subject to the metropolitan alone. His plea was over ruled; he was suspended from all episcopal functions, for having disobeyed the King's order, and Nathanael (afterwards Lord) Crew, Thomas Sprat, and Thomas White, Bishops of Durnam, Rochester and Peterborough, were vested with the administration of his diocese.</P>
<P>To crown all his endeavours in behalf of the Roman communion, James sent Roger Palmer Earl of Castle∣main,
<PB N="467" REF="504"/>with a splendid embassy, to the Pope, to acknow∣ledge his Majesty's spiritual obedience to his Holiness, and reconcile his kingdoms to the Catholic religion. This noblemen was received at Rome with the most mortifying indifference. The Pope was at variance with Lewis XII. the French King, and looked upon James as the partizan and pensioner of that Monarch. He dreaded the effects of his frantic zeal, and knew his connections with the Jesuits, whom Innocent XI. detested. Though he granted audience to the am∣bassador, he always pretended to be seized with a fit of coughing, which interrupted the Earl's speech, and obliged him to retire. All that Castlemain could ob∣tain was a dispensation, for Father Peters, the King's confessor, permitting him to enjoy a bishopric, which however he did not obtain. The Pope likewise sent over a Nuncio to London; a compliment which he could not decently avoid.</P>
<P>A. D. 1687.] Notwithstanding all discouragements, James still persisted in his favourite design of convert∣ing the three kingdoms; and finding himself deserted by the church-party, he affected to caress the Presby∣terians. On the fourth of April he published a de∣claration for liberty of conscience, and said he did not doubt of its meeting with the approbation of the parliament. It was so agreeable to all the Non-con∣formists, that he received the warmest addresses of thanks from the Anabaptists, Quakers, Independants, and Presbyterians. In these they extolled the royal power, which they had so long endeavoured to abase. They triumphed over the churchmen, and published many virulent invectives against the established form of discipline. The King fomented this difference be∣tween two parties, to which he was equally averse. In private he talked of nothing but the injustice and oppression to which the Non-conformists had been sub∣jected by the church of England. He pursued this artifice so far as to give order for a reversion of suits
<PB N="468" REF="505"/>which had been instituted in ecclesiastical courts against the Dissenters. But this animosity was of short du∣ration; they soon perceived the King's drift, and their mutual resentment subsided. Some of the English Bishops were so abject, as to influence their inferior clergy to send flattering addresses upon the declaration. The King, having hitherto succeeded beyond even his own expectation, resolved to open a way for the Roman Catholics into the church and universities of England. He recommended Father Francis, a Benedictine monk, to the university of Cambridge, for the degree of Master of Arts. They perceiving the dangerous con∣sequence of such an admission, presented a petition, be∣seeching the King to revoke his mandate: and sent a deputation to London, with a remonstrance on the same subject. Their petition wa disregarded; their depu∣ties were denied a hearing; and the Vice Chancellor was summoned to appear before the ecclesiastical court. He was deprived of his office; yet the university still refused to admit Francis, and the King thought proper to desist from his purpose: but he prosecuted his at∣tempt upon Oxford with more perseverance. The place of President in Magdalen college being vacant, he sent a mandate in favour of one Farmer, a new convert, and whose character, in other respects, lay under imputation. They petitioned his Majesty, that they might be allowed to chuse their own President, according to the statutes of the college; or that his Majesty would recommend a person properly qualified for such an important office. As no answer was made to this remonstrance, the fellows of the college elected Dr. Hough, a man of learning, integrity, and resolu∣tion. The King was incensed at their presumption: and the Vice President and fellows were cited before the ecclesiastical court, for having disobeyed the King's order. They represented, that they were restrained from chusing Farmer by their statutes, and the nature of the oath they had taken: and proved Farmer in
<PB N="469" REF="506"/>every respect unqualified for such an office. Notwith∣standing their defence, the court decreed that the new President should be deprived of his office; and that the Vice-President and one of the fellows should be suspended. But the King, being informed of what had appeared to the prejudice of Farmer's character, sent another mandate in favour of Samuel Parker, Bishop of Oxford, who was as disagreeable as the other. The fellows refusing to comply with this injunction, the King repaired to Oxford in person, reproached them with their insolence and disobedience in the most im∣perious terms, and commanded them to chuse Parker their President without further delay: but they still re∣jected him. His Majesty then established an inferior commission to visit the college: and, in short, the recusants were all expelled from it, and deprived of their fellowships, excepting two of them who com∣plied. Notwithstanding this sentence, the President refused to quit his house till he was forcibly expelled. Then the college was filled with Catholics.</P>
<P>The Pope had, in the preceding year, conferred the dignity of Nuncio upon Ferdinand Dada, who had re∣sided privately in England, and attended the King's person ever since his accession to the throne. His Ma∣jesty now resolved to pull off the mask, and produce him in public to his people; though, by the laws of England, no person could assume the character of Pope's Nuncio, without incurring the penalty of high treason. On July 3, this priest made his public entry into Wind∣sor, in his pontificals, preceded by the cross, and at∣tended by a great number of Monks in their orders.</P>
<P>A. D. 1688.] In order to demonstrate his contempt for the malcontents of the kingdom, James published another declaration for liberty of conscience, and abo∣lishing the penal laws: and the Bishops were enjoined, by an order of council, to cause this declaration to be read in all churches of their different dioceses. Wil∣liam Lloyd Bishop of St. Asaph, Thomas Ken of
<PB N="470" REF="507"/>Bath and Wells, Francis Turner of Ely, John Lake of Chichester, Thomas White of Peterborough, and Sir Jonathan Trelawny of Bristol, being then in Lon∣don, no sooner received these orders, than they hasten∣ed to Lambeth, to consult with William Sancroft Archbishop of Canterbury. There they deliberated upon the subject, and agreed in opinion, that they could not obey the King's command, without betray∣ing their consciences, and their duty to God and their country. They therefore drew up and signed a peti∣tion to the King, representing their unwillingness to be concerned in publishing the declaration. They pro∣tested their reluctance did not proceed from any spi∣rit of opposition to his Majesty's will, nor to a defect of tenderness for the Non-conformists; but solely from the nature of the declaration itself, founded on a dis∣pensing power, which the parliament, on several oc∣casions, had declared illegal. On May 18, they went in a body to the palace, and presented this petition to the King, who received and read it with marks of sur∣prize and displeasure. He said, he did not look for such an address from the church of England, particu∣larly from some among them; that they should hear from him if he should change his opinion; if not, he expected they would obey his order. They answered, that they were resigned to the will of Heaven, and re∣tired. An order was soon after given by the council, upon the Bishops refusing to retract their petition, for their commitment to the Tower; and the Attorney-General was ordered to prosecute them for having written and published a seditious libel against his Ma∣jesty's government. The King resolved they should be carried to the Tower by water, as the whole city was in commotion. The people were no sooner in∣formed of their destination, than they ran to the side of the river, which was lined with an incredible multi∣tude. As the reverend prisoners passed, the populace fell upon their knees, craving their blessing, calling
<PB N="471" REF="508"/>upon Heaven to protect them, and exhorting them to suffer nobly for their religion. A vast croud was as∣sembled at the Tower, where they were received in the same manner. The Prelates went immediately to the Tower-chapel, to thank Heaven for those afflictions, which, for the sake of religion, they were thought worthy to endure. Soon after the Bishops were ad∣mitted to bail, and June 29 was fixed for their trial. They were attended to Westminster Hall by nine and twenty Peers, a great number of gentlemen, and an innumerable croud of people. The cause was consi∣dered as a crisis, that would produce either national slavery or freedom; and therefore it was heard with the most eager attention. The dispute was learnedly managed on both sides: and Holloway and Powel, two of the Judges, declared themselves in favour of the Bishops. The jury withdrew into a chamber, where they passed the whole night; but next morning they returned to the court, and pronounced the Bishops "Not guilty." Westminster Hall instantly rung with loud acclamations, which were communicated through the whole extent of London and Westminster. The King was greatly chagrined, and published a procla∣mation, forbidding the people to assemble in the streets: but notwithstanding this prohibition, the whole city was lighted up by bonfires and illuminations, to the unspeakable mortification of James, who threaten∣ed to deliver up the Bishops to the ecclesiastical court; and, as a mark of his indignation, deprived Holloway and Powel of their offices.</P>
<P>The King's obstinacy and perseverance seemed to increase in proportion to the people's opposition. His designing courtiers continually stimulated him with in-treaties and exhortations to proceed in the execution of his project; and he was encouraged by the service sub∣missions of some Protestant divines. The Bishops of Durham, Rochester, before-mentioned, and Thomas Cartwright, Bishop of Chester, still approved of all
<PB N="472" REF="509"/>his measures. The clergy of Cheshire presented an abject address, condemning the conduct of the seven Prelates who had scrupled to publish the declaration. The Bishop of Durham suspended thirty ministers of his diocese who refused to read it: and the inhabitants of Carlisle (whose Prelate was Thomas Smith) declared they would concur with his Majesty in repealing the test and penal laws. James, far from altering his con∣duct, issued orders for prosecuting all those clergymen who refused reading his declaration. Every individual, who knew the value of liberty, and was attached to the established religion, now plainly saw, that, without an immediate and vigorous opposition to the measures of the King's ministers, the nation would be reduced to the most abject state of spiritual and temporal subjec∣tion. They perceived the necessity of having recourse to foreign aid, and looked upon the Prince of Orange as their natural ally and protector. The Prince was no stranger to the murmurs and discontents of the Eng∣lish. He had sent over an Envoy on pretence of con∣gratulating James on the birth of the Prince of Wales: but had given him secret instructions to treat with the chiefs of the malcontents; and the agent executed his commission with equal secresy and success. A formal invitation was sent to the Prince, from great numbers of the nobility and gentry, intreating him to come over and assist them in the recovery of their liberties, and promising to assist him with their lives and fortunes. Even Sunderland, the favourite minister of James, is said to have corresponded with the Prince, and betray∣ed his infatuated master. The Prince began to make preparations; and James was alarmed at his proceed∣ings, but could not for some time believe he intended an invasion. Being at last convinced of the Prince's design, he made some preparations for defence. On November 5, the Prince of Orange landed at Brox∣holme in Torbay, Devonshire; and was some days be∣fore he was joined by any persons of distinction: but
<PB N="473" REF="510"/>on the tenth day after his landing, when he began to deliberate about reimbarking, he was joined by several persons of distinction, with bodies of horsemen; and his affairs now assumed a more promising aspect.</P>
<P>The unhappy Monarch now found himself deserted by the greatest part of his nobility; his troops revolted daily; and at last he was abandoned by his own daugh∣ter Anne Princess of Denmark. When James was made acquainted with the flight of his favourite daugh∣ter, he could not help bursting into tears, and exclaim∣ed, in an agony of grief "God help me! my own children have forsaken me." He now tottered on the brink of destruction; and, finding himself in this de∣solate situation, he sent deputies to the Prince of O∣range to treat for an accommodation. The Prince sent his proposals, and every thing tended to an agreement, by the King's concessions; but his resolution was un∣happily altered before morning. His private coun∣sellors advised him to retire into France, where he would be protected by a powerful and generous Monarch, who would enable him to resume the reins of govern∣ment upon his own terms. The Queen embarked on board a small vessel, that conveyed her and the Prince of Wales to Calais: and the King, having sent an or∣der to disband the army, disguised himself in plain ap∣parel, and embarked in a boat at Whitehall. He threw the great seal into the Thames, that it might not fall into the hands of his enemies; and proceeded to∣wards the mouth of the river, where a vessel lay for his reception. The vessel in which his Majesty em∣barked barked was detained at Feversham, by the common people, who discovered Sir Edward Hales on board, and mistook the King for his priest or chaplain. In this opinion they arrested, robbed, and insulted their unfortunate Sovereign: but a constable at last knowing him, fell at his feet, begging pardon for the people; and they, with marks of contrition, offered to restore the plunder. He received some jewels they had taken
<PB N="474" REF="511"/>from him, but desired them to keep the money. The news of his being discovered, in such a manner, had very different effects upon different persons. The hearts of the people began to relent at the distress of their Sovereign. The nobility and magistrates of the city began to fear they had been too officious; and having consulted together, they deputed four of their number to wait upon his Majesty, and intreat him to return to Whitehall: and his coaches were immediate∣ly dispatched to Feversham. The Prince of Orange sent a message to the King, desiring he would retire to Rochester, until measures could be taken with regard to his affairs. Before this message was delivered, the King arrived in London, where he was received amidst the acclamations of the people. The Prince of Orange dispatched his regiment of Dutch guards to take pos∣session of the two palaces of St. James's and Whitehall: and sent notice to his Majesty that it would be proper for him to retire to Richmond. He was obliged to acquiesce with the Prince's command; but expressed a desire of going to Rochester. The Prince, perceiving his design was to leave the kingdom, readily complied with this request, and the King set out for that place. The Prince of Orange the same day fixed his residence at St. James's, where he received the compliments of the nobility and the Lord Mayor of London. After having reposed himself a few days, he assembled all the nobility, and desired they would concert proper measures for convoking a free parliament for the pre∣servation servation of the Protestant religion, and the security of the rights and liberties of the people. They voted an address of thanks to his Highness; and resolved to meet every day in the house of Peers, to deliberate up∣on what he had recommended to their attention. James, now finding himself stripped of his authority, resolved to withdraw himself out of the reach of a people who had renounced his government, and a rival from whose ambition he did not think his life altogether secure.
<PB N="475" REF="512"/>On December 23, he privately departed from Ro∣chester, attended by his natural son the Duke of Ber∣wick, and two domestics, to the sea side, where a vessel was prepared. There embarking he set sail for France, and arrived at the port of Ambletcuse: from whence he repaired to St. Germain, where he found his Queen and the Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>His Majesty's departure was no sooner known, than the Peers presented an address to the Prince, d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siring he would take into his hands the administration of the government, civil and military, until a convention of the estates should assemble. Before the Prince would take this step, he was resolved to be authorised by the Commons as well as the Peers. He published an or∣der, requiring all those, who had served as Members of Parliament in the reign of Charles II. together with the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and fifty Common coun∣cil-men of the city of London, to meet on December 26, that he might consult them on the present posture of affairs. They accordingly assembled at the appoint∣ed time, when, after some debates upon the authority by which they had been convened, they concurred with the resolution of the Peers. Being thus invested with the supreme authority, he ordered Barillon the French Ambassador to quit the kingdom immediately. Next day he received the communion in the manner practised in the church of England. He published a procla∣mation, authorising all Protestants, who had public employments, to continue in the exercise of them, till the meeting of the convention: he dismissed all the Catholic officers from the army; and at the same time he released the Earl of Feversham.</P>
<P>A. D. 1689.] The Archbishop of Canterbury, who had hitherto stood neuter, now went, accompanied with eight other prelates, to make a tender of their services to the Prince, and subscribed the association: at the same time he was complimented by ninety Presbyterian ministers, who went in a body to pay their respects, and
<PB N="476" REF="513"/>were civilly received. The convention met on Ja∣nuary 22, and, each house having chose a Speaker, the Prince's letter was read to this effect: That he had complied with their desires in re-establishing the peace and public safety of the kingdom; and now it was their business to secure their religion, laws, and liber∣ties, upon a sure footing. He observed, that the dangerous situation of the Protestants in Ireland re∣quired immediate relief; and that, except a disunion among themselves, nothing could be more prejudicial than a delay in their deliberations: that the States Ge∣neral would have immediate occasion for the troops they had furnished, as well as for the speedy assistance of the English, against a powerful enemy with whom they were at war: and he persuaded himself, that, besides the obligation of treaties, they would be ready to assist the Dutch as Protestants and friends, who had expressed such ardour for the preservation of the English constitution. Both houses immedately pre∣sented an address to the Prince, in which they acknow∣ledged, that, under God, the nation was indebted to him for its deliverance. They approved of his admi∣nistration, and begged he would continue to manage the affairs of government, until they should have oc∣casion to present another address; and they promised to pay the utmost deference to all the contents of his letter. They ordained a day of thanksgiving for the happy deliverance of the nation; and the Bishops, by command of the upper house, inserted, in the service of the day, a particular prayer for the Prince of Orange.</P>
<P>King James had written a letter to his privy counsel∣lors, desiring their advice in the present conjuncture. It was printed and published by his direction; but as he received no answer from those to whom it was ad∣dressed, he sent a letter to each house of the conven∣tion; in which he promised, on the word of a King, to grant a general indemnity, even to those who had betrayed him, excepting a very few, whom he could
<PB N="477" REF="514"/>not with safety forgive: but the two houses refused to take the letters into consideration.</P>
<P>The Lords debated the question, "Whether there was actually an original contract between the King and people?" And it was carried in the affirmative by a majority of seven voices. Then they disputed upon the grammatical signification of the word <HI>abdicated,</HI> and agreed that <HI>deserted</HI> should be used in its place. The next thing they examined was the term <HI>vacant;</HI> and this question was proposed, "Whether, supposing King James had violated the original contract between him and his people, and abandoned the government, the throne was thereby become vacant?" the Tories maintained, that, by the laws of England, the King could never die: of consequence the throne could not be vacant; and it passed in the negative by a majority of eleven: forty Peers, however, entered a protest against this decision. Some of the Whig party moved, that, supposing King James virtually died, they should acknowledge the Prince and Princess of Orange King and Queen of England: but this proposal was rejected by a small majority. On February 2, the Lords sent down the vote of the Commons, with their amend∣ments, which were not approved by the lower house. A conference was held, without producing an accom∣modation: then the Commons appointed four and twenty members, to maintain the opinions of their house, in a new conference; and the Peers nominated the Earls of Nottingham, Clarendon, Rochester, and Pembroke, the Bishop of Ely, and some others, to support their sentiments in favour of the amend∣ments they had proposed. This conference was ma∣naged with great ability, on the part of the Commons, by Hambden, Somers, Holt, Maynard, Treby, Sa∣cheverel, Pollexfen, Sir Robert Howard, Sir Richard Temple, Foley, and Ayres: yet rather than shock the Tories by attacking their favourite doctrines, they chose to wave some strong arguments they might
<PB N="478" REF="515"/>have drawn from the necessity of the case, the first prin∣ciples of the constitution, and the natural sight that the people certainly had, in such emergencies, to pro∣vide extraordinary remedies for the preservation of the community. The report of this conference, made to the house of Peers, produced warm debates: but, at length, the majority agreed to desist from their amend∣ments, and the house concurred with the vote of the Commons, "That King James had abdicated the go∣vernment, and thereby the throne was become vacant."</P>
<P>The Prince sending for the Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Derby, Shrewsbury, and some other noblemen, told them he had hitherto kept silence, that he might not seem to interfere with the freedom of their delibe∣rations. He said he knew some persons were inclined to a regency, to which he had no objection; but, for his own part, he would not undertake the office. O∣thers, he observed, were desirous of raising the Prin∣cess to the throne; and that he should reign by her courtesy. He declared his great esteem for the Prin∣cess, but he was not of a humour to hold a crown de∣pendant upon any woman on earth; nor would he have any share in the government unless invested with it for life: nevertheless, if they thought proper to act in another manner, he would give them no opposition, but return to Holland, without meddling further in their affairs; but in case they should invest him with the royalty for life, he would agree that the posterity of the Princess Anne should be preferred to that which he might have by a second marriage.</P>
<P>After much altercation, the two houses agreed, and each voted apart, that the Prince and Princess of Orange should reign jointly as King and Queen of Eng∣land; but that the administration should be in the hands of the Prince alone.</P>
