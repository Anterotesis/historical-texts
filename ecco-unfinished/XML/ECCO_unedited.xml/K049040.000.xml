<P>Arden of Feversham. AN HISTORICAL TRAGEDY: TAKEN FROM HOLINGSHEAD's CHRONICLE, In the Reign of King EDWARD VI. ACTED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, in DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE, <HI>By a FRIEND</HI>. Spoken by Mr. HAVARD.</HEAD>
<L>THE piece is <HI>Lillo</HI>'s—He, long since in dust:</L>
<L>Criticks far hence; or spare his urn's sad trust,</L>
<L>Kind to his Muse, and to his memory just;</L>
<L>His Muse resembles him, and knows no art;</L>
<L>She speaks not to the head, but to the heart.</L>
<L>The artless maid, by no false seal impress'd,</L>
<L>Bears but an honest copy of his breast:</L>
<L>And ev'ry eye has own'd, his natural lay,</L>
<L>Sprung from the heart, wings to the heart it's way.</L>
<L>The Tragic Bard apes not the Epick fire,</L>
<L>On Fancy's wing still aiming to aspire:</L>
<L>In Nature's palace, simple, great, and plain,</L>
<L>Inrich'd and crowded <HI>ornament</HI> were vain:</L>
<L><HI>Embellishment</HI> does but distract the mind,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Art</HI> should never to <HI>minuteness</HI> bind.</L>
<L>Tho' honey'd language she from Hybla steal,</L>
<L>Your <HI>ears</HI> applaud—your hearts no ardours feel.</L>
<L>With labour'd art tho' the sad tale be told,</L>
<L>The melting tear, mean while congeal'd, grows cold.</L>
<L>When <HI>Passion</HI> speaks immediate to the soul,</L>
<L><HI>Parts</HI> she o'erlooks, to grasp at once <HI>the whole</HI>.</L>
<L>To night, your Bard, from your own annals shews,</L>
<L>A dreadful story of domestic woes:</L>
<L>From facts he draws (his picture's from the life)</L>
<L>The injur'd husband, and the faithless wife,</L>
<L>Doom'd all the train of bosom pangs to prove,</L>
<L>Pangs, which must always wait on lawless love.</L>
<L>Ye generous who feel for other's woe,</L>
<L>Ye fair, whose tears for injur'd virtue flow,</L>
<L>In justice to yourselves, applaud his plan,</L>
<L>And judge <HI>the poet</HI>, as ye lov'd <HI>the man</HI>.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, <HI>By a FRIEND</HI>. Spoken by the young Gentlewoman who performed ALICIA.</HEAD>
<L>AN ancient bard, vers'd in dramatick laws,</L>
<L>Has said, (and well he knew to gain his cause)</L>
<L>"The seasoning of a play, is the applause <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ben Jonson's Volpone.</NOTE>."</L>
<L>Within these walls, this truth no doubt will bear,</L>
<L>Without such seasoning, there's no 'biding here.—</L>
<L>First for our author: for his play, I mean;</L>
<L>(For he's beyond the reach of critick-spleen)</L>
<L>If he has touch'd your hearts, your tears will show it,</L>
<L>And your hands echo back, you acquit the poet.</L>
<L>Next, our performance; there, we've done our best:</L>
<L>And where ought's wanting, you'll supply the rest:</L>
<L>I know you will, you must; from hence I spy,</L>
<L>Good nature sparkling in each-generous eye.</L>
<L>Lost for my humble self,—thus low I sue; <HI>[curtfying.</HI></L>
<L>Do not too rigid give me all my due:</L>
<L>What's wanting, pardon: and if ought appears,</L>
<L>That may be ripen'd by theatrick-years:</L>
<L>Kindly protect the plant, your smiles now raise,</L>
<L>Be mine, obedient thanks; yours, all the praise.</L>
