<HEAD>DEDICATION.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO THE Right Hon. LORD THURLOW, LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD, or may it please your Lordship,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Need not acquaint your Lordship, that a Publication without a Dedi∣cation is as great a Phaenomenon as a Minister without Power, a Peer with∣out Principle, a Bishop without Learn∣ing, or a Maid of Honor without Chastity; and that it stands as little chance of a favourable reception, as a Candidate for a Place, who carries with him no other recommendation than Integrity and Capability.—Every one who resorts to the press, whether in the character of Author, Editor, or
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>Compiler, decorates his Frontispiece with some illustrious name or other, and catches at that opportunity of of∣fering incense to the God of his ido∣latry.—One does it from motives of avarice, to squeeze from the vain and credulous a few of his superfluous guineas—A second, from motives of security, shrewdly concluding that the respect spontaneously and implicitly given to great-personages, will protect his Works from the Teeth of Envy, Malignity, and Criticism.—A third, from Vanity, to prove that he can∣not be nobody, since he has the honor of knowing somebody.—A fourth, from the most laudable motives, to hold up for imitation to the <HI>Belle Monde</HI> a sample of conjugal Fidelity, and to let their Ladyships see, that a woman may rise above the rest of her sex, without ruining her husband, and gain admiration without losing her reputation.—And a fifth (to go no fur∣ther) from Gratitude, to do homage
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>to his patron, and to offer him his warmest tribute of thanks, the only recompence in his power, for twice ten thousand favours conferred upon him.—Thus ****, and many a poor devil of a garretteer have had their dupe in N—d. Thus, Sir Wil∣liam Chambers looked for a buckler in Majesty—Thus, before he was Secre∣tary to the Board of Trade, had Cum∣berland his Grafton.—Thus, had Ditto his Model in the prudent and chaste Manchester:—and thus do I pique myself upon having my Apollo, my Maecenas, <HI>magnis editus regibus,</HI> my <HI>proesidium &amp; dulce decus</HI> in the most noble and accomplished Lord Thur∣low. Most noble and accomplished indeed! I challenge all the biogra∣phers in Christendom to name me a man from Adam down to the inge∣nious Mr. Pinchbeck, that can touch the heel of your Lordship's shoe, ei∣ther as the Statesman, the Orator, or the Gentleman. Besides that you are a
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>limb of the ancient and hereditary peerage (which by the way must be a matter of considerable consolation in these days, when it is so fashionable to tilt at those Lords who are not such, and to twit them in the teeth with being upstarts, creatures of the day, tools of power, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.) I say, my Lord, that besides this, it is well known your Lordship is Keeper of the K—'s Conscience, and the great Atlas of the state: nor is it less noto∣rious, or less generally acknowledged, that you are the Paragon of Taste, the Pink of Courtesy, and Test of Ele∣gance.</P>
<P>Here, my Lord, I must take the liberty which dedications tolerate, of touching upon that generous concern for your country, which influences every action your life; and on that candor, sincerity, complacency of manners, and winning condescension which distinguish your debate, and se∣cure to you the admiration and esteem
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>of all your hearers; and in doing this, I have no intentions of treading the beaten track and comparing you to Demosthenes or Cicero. To insinuate that you ever had a type or parallel, is to derogate from your <HI>peerless</HI> endow∣ments. No, my Lord, you are your∣self, an Original, an Archetype, a Nonsuch.</P>
<P>I am aware that this language will offend one who has in <HI>an hundred in∣stances</HI> betrayed an aversion to applause, tho' he is for ever deserving it; but, my Lord, for once your delicacy and humility must be disappointed. I can∣not bring myself to sacrifice my gra∣tifications to your wishes, and give up the pleasure I am sure to receive in doing you homage, only because you are too modest to receive your due. In vain do you bid me be silent; I can no more check my gratitude than your Lordship can your generosity; and only when you cease to deserve praise, shall I be able to with-hold it.</P>
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>
<P>Thus much for what I had to ad∣dress personally to your Lordship. As to the following Sheets, which by be∣ing honored with your kind patron∣age, are now to partake of your im∣mortality, what I have to communi∣cate about them, will perhaps appear with more propriety, and a better grace in an Advertisement to the can∣did Public, for whose future behoof, and not as a trap for reputation or pro∣motion, I send them to the Press.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honor of being, as ever, MY LORD, Your Lordship's devoted, and grateful humble Servant, A SENATOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>MINISTERS, like other men, have their passions, and their filles de joie; and these filles de joie, like those of an in∣ferior class, will sometimes play their keepers false. It was to this infidelity that I am in∣debted for the discovery of certain mens po∣litics.—About a fortnight since, a valet of mine (a smart, young Irishman) in one of his twilight saunters in the Park, was ac∣costed by Mrs. Harvey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lady will be better known perhaps by the name of Poll H—es.</NOTE>; and after a short preliminary or two, conducted to her apart∣ments in G—t O—d Street. It seems that she had heard that the Irish surpassed all other nations in gymnastic exercises, and secretly resolved to embrace the first moment of put∣ting their boasted pre-eminence to the test. Her keeper, Lord Churllow, happily was at that period in the country; and a more fa∣vourable one she never could look for: she seized the golden opportunity, and was con∣vinced that the pre-eminence was more than imaginary. The fellow, she naturally con∣cluded,
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>would expect a recompence for his trouble; and her purse was instantly tendered, but, with the true spirit of an Irishman, he scorned to receive wages from the Fair, and begged to be excused. His disinterestedness charmed the lady, and determined her to se∣cure his further acquaintance. "I cannot think (cried she) of dismissing you without some tokens of my gratitude for the trouble I have given you."—"Far from thinking it any trouble at all, at all, I shall be always <HI>ready,</HI> tho' I say it, who should not say it, to wait upon your sweet ladyship, whenever you shall do little Roger O' Tickle the honor to summon him." "I take you at your word, but you must accept some token."—"Not I, upon my conscience."—"Some little keep-sake only then; here, step to the toilet, and make your election of the things on it." He obeyed; and, as my lucky stars would have it, pitched upon a little Green Box, which seemed to court his acceptance, and which Lord Churllow had that morning, in his hurry, left there. The lady, ignorant of its precious contents, (for she conceived his Lordship had left it as a present) consented to his taking it away with him. I happened luckily to be at my door just as O' Tickle returned with the box under his arm. I had several times at my friend Lord Toper's seen a ministerial green box, and knew this to be one. I ques∣tioned
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>the fellow about it; and as, like the rest of his countrymen, he has too much spirit to tell a lie, I collected to a tittle what I have just communicated. Suspecting that it might possibly contain something worthy the search, I begg'd this <HI>treasure of secresy</HI> of him, and was gratified. I had not possessed it half a dozen seconds before I hastened to my library, full of the discoveries I knew I was about to make. I own at first some scruples of con∣science about opening the box pressed im∣pertinently upon my mind; but the recollec∣tion that Count ****** (a man of acknow∣ledged nice honor) had fully debated, and settled the matter before me, determined me to open it, and <HI>presto cockilorum</HI> up flew the lid <HI>sans</HI> further ceremony or delay.</P>
<P>The <HI>general</HI> applause the count gained from his countrymen by his conduct on that occasion, bids me hope for the approbation of an English public.—O you, my coun∣trymen and fellow-sufferers, whose perdi∣tion I cannot help anticipating, and whose eyes I wish to open, shall it be said of you, whose annals record your spirited and success∣ful opposition to powerful usurpation, that you wage unjust and savage war with your fellow subjects, with freemen, gloriously struggling for their rights and immunities? Shall sons of the men who dethroned mighty potentates submit to be the slaves of
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>things<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I trust it will not be imputed to me, that I mean <HI>the three things</HI> a patriotic earl (whose zealous exertion of his fine talents in the cause of civil liberty cannot be too much applauded) <HI>stooped</HI> to make mention of in the great debate on the Spanish manifesto, viz. the gewgaw turtle-eating drowsy thing;—the catch and glee fresh-water thing;—and the thing without candor, without veracity, without faith, which no man could trust, or safely ven∣ture upon the smallest intercourse with.—No, God help them, they are poor, insignificant, harmless things; —mere puppets, without souls, wills, hearts, or tongues of their own. The things I squint at are in one word the two Scotch things, which keep behind the curtain, and want the common spirit of men to come forward and avow their detestable principles.</NOTE> as impotent as they are corrupt? and bear from petty engrossers of delegated power, what their fathers would not suffer from true proprietors of the royal authority? Will you not at last think and act like Eng∣lishmen of true spirit? or will you <HI>slumber</HI> on till sorely galled by the yoke, you find yourselves necessitated, like oppressed Ame∣rica, to solicit protection of your haughty and natural enemies<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A day or two before I determined to publish these papers, I fully intended to put these four queries in my seat to the representatives of the people, but Mr. Fox saved me the <HI>sweating,</HI> by doing the same thing in one of the most eloquent, masterly, and spirited speeches that ever was, or perhaps ever will be delivered within those or any other walls. I saw too plainly how poor a chance I stood of acting upon the auditory, when such eloquence could persuade a third part only of the mem∣bers present to be honest and faithful to their trust.</NOTE>?</P>
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
<P>The EDITOR, in close imitation of the Count, has published the present papers with∣out any arrangement, but merely as he drew them out of the box; and he can, with Christian sincerity, add, without erasing a tit∣tle, or without the shadow of a hope of get∣ting a pension for his pains. He leaves it to the penetration of the Count's readers to de∣termine whether <HI>he</HI> has been in like manner impartial and unexpectant.</P>
<P>The Editor held himself at full liberty to subjoin his own remarks, and to enlarge more or less on particular parts, not in proportion to their importance, but just as fancy dic∣tated; and this he did without caring to be at the trouble of correcting or revising them. It may be said that this is not the most despi∣cable apology in the world for suppressing one's sentiments, but an insufficient vindica∣tion of them after their appearance.—Granted. And therefore he shall only observe, that if they have the good luck to gain the public approbation, no excuse need be given for them; if they have not, he fears none will be admitted. Thus much however he af∣firms, they are offered to the public in the humble language of truth and sincerity, as untainted by churlish humours of malcon∣tentedness, as uncorrupted by flattery. Tho' a senator, he is not enlisted under either of the banners of party, and knows the great
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>only by the fruits of their works. Too just to think worth incompatible with rank, and too proud to court the acquaintance of the great, because they are powerful, he has praised or censured but as he found them true or recreant to the state.</P>
<Q><L>Quid Romae faciam? mentiri nescio, magnum</L>
<L>Si malus est, nequeo laudare et poscere.</L></Q>
<P>He has not taken advantage of his con∣cealment, and Fanfaron-like broached things which he shall either blush or fear to main∣tain. He has not even told as much truth as he has come at; and where left to fancy, con∣trary to the present custom of political dab∣lers, he has supposed good. He had rather that ninety-and-nine guilty persons escape, than be the means of holding up one inno∣cent to ridicule or obloquy.</P>

<HEAD>EDITOR's REMARK.</HEAD>
<P>However hard these terms may appear on the part of Mr. now a Lord Churllow, they certainly kick the beam the moment the other scale receives its ponderous freight of twelve thousand pounds a year, a fat Di—ss for a C—dp—le, and provision infinite for p—ps and parsons. The D—l himself needs not desire a surer bait to catch all the lawyers in Christendom.—For the conversion of those (if any such there are) who still are inclined to think that B. has outwitted C. in the contract, it will not be amiss to add, that the latter is allowed on all hands to be as cunning an old fox as ever carried a brush. The former unquestionably is no conjurer.</P>
<P>SECOND REMARK.</P>
<P>Honors, and the marks of respect commonly annexed to them, may flatter the vanity of men, but as they are not always the proof and reward of merit, in themselves include no real glory or solid greatness. When dealt out with a lavish and indiscriminate hand, they cease, in some sense, to be honors. Our nobles are become so numerous that it is almost necessary to have nomen∣clators, like those that attended the candidates at Rome, to tell them the names of the citizens. But the **** who hath turned the spirit of the nation against himself, must use every means in his power to detach particular men from the body of the people, and to make them act by motives of private interest against the public sense.</P>
<P>THIRD REMARK.</P>
<P>In creations, process of lineage should always be con∣sidered; how lightly soever some may treat it, no man despises birth, but he who is conscious of his deficiency in that point. Merit indeed may supply the want of birth so far as to deserve esteem, but it must be united with birth to claim respect, as well as esteem from all ranks.—The only genuine claims to merit are public spirit, a sound heart, clean hands, an attachment to the
<PB N="20" REF="17"/>reigning house, the practice of religious duties, and a conduct invariably upright. Nothing more promotes a spirit of emulation than the countenancing family repute. It was this that heightened the valor of the ancient Eng∣lish, and made family vie with family which should pro∣duce the greatest number of heroes. The histories of many noble families still extant among us will sufficiently verify this assertion; and there is no truth more obvious, than that if men will not act greatly for the enhancing of their family honor to which they have so close an af∣finity, they seldom will for the good of their country; for the more diffused their connections become in gene∣ral, the less interested will they think themselves, and consequently the less tenacious will they be of the public welfare.—Thus when it should no longer be accounted of any consideration to be born of ancestors who have eminently distinguished themselves by any worthy acts of public utility, but the man of yesterday, by only pos∣sessing a more than common share of impudence and chicane, shall be holden in equal reverence and repute, emulation will inevitably subside, and the desire of fame, which has been the source of so many meritorious at∣chievements, will soon be extinguished; for every one will then live uninfluenced by the conduct of his proge∣nitors, and equally unawed by any odium an infamous conduct may leave upon record.</P>
<P>FOURTH REMARK.</P>
<P>For the credit of human nature it is to be hoped there exists not such a fool as that Prince must be, who abets the divisions of his people, instead of striving to unite them, and to be himself the center of their union; and who puts himself at the head of a party in order to go∣vern his people, instead of heading his people in order to extirpate all party. Nothing is more certain or more demonstrable than that <HI>princes are made</HI> for the people, and not the people for them; and perhaps there is no nation under the sun more entirely possessed of this notion of princes than the English; so that the prince who does not govern himself by this maxim must expect to find in the people strenuous opponents of his will and pursuits.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
<P>FIFTH REMARK.</P>
<P>Our annals show that the inhabitants of this ancient kingdom have ever borne an implacable hatred to that preliminary tyrant—a favourite; for which reason the wisest of our monarchs never bestowed the royal confidence on one man, but distributed that and all other favours equally among the great officers of state; and the reigns of these monarchs are the happiest and easiest on record. So great indeed is the people's aversion to this creature of power, that it has often produced the noblest effects, though personally fatal to the deluded prince or his fa∣vourite: whilst this aversion continues the constitution is safe; and no longer than the constitution is main∣tained in its original purity, is majesty secure. The history of all governments, however despotic, verifies this remark.—I am ready to support this and every other I make on the present papers against any attack that comes with common sense and common decency in it.</P>

<SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE herewith send you, under the care of our trusty and beloved plenipo∣tentiaries C. J. and Sir J. M. six sheets, con∣taining rules for your general conduct, both within and without the House. You will do well to peruse them with all possible dis∣patch and attention.—We hold it but equi∣table to apprize your Lordship, that on your strict observance of them depends the en∣joyment of your present honorable, and what is of infinitely more import, very lu∣crative places.—The additions we are now about to make to what those sheets will un∣fold, shall be equally plain, and comprized in as few words as their importance will allow.</P>
<P><Q>“It is our joint will and pleasure, that you prefer all Scots Tories and Jacobites who may do you the honor to solicit steeples and places in your gift; and this without presuming to question their qua∣lifications,
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>or weighing their deserts. And in cases where none of the above descrip∣tion apply, you are to pay due respect to the recommendations of members, care∣fully distinguishing between the leaders and the subordinates; between those who bring in and those brought in; between the declaimers and the gapers or silent voters; those who want places and those we want in place. You shall encourage and promote, to the utmost of your abi∣lities, sloth, effeminacy, gaming, dissipa∣tion, and luxury, with its attendant ele∣gancies, as the surest means of impoverish∣ing and humbling the people, that they may be enslaved with more ease, and ”plundered with less risque.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“You shall make frequent, though slight attacks upon the F*****m of the C**********n, till the present spiritless murmurs are changed into loud menaces, and these ripen into insurrections. In one short, comprehensive word, You shall ”make our cause your own.</Q></P>
<P>We deem it fit to apprize your Lordship that all our future commands will be delivered to you by one or other of our two plenipoes. Should any find their way to you through any other channel, or mode of conveyance, you are to consider them as spurious: our enemies are subtle, and adepts in the arts of
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>low deception, and it behoves us to be close and vigilant; whilst we are so, we have no∣thing to dread; nothing to fling away a thought upon: secure in our numbers, se∣curer in the—'s vindictive and inflexible spi∣rit; and still securest in our all-promising, powerful, and secret ally, we have every thing to hope.</P>

<P>The man must be little better than a natural who can suspect them of disaffection to so generous a master.—Has he not at the first word adopted all their systems and measures?—Do they not direct and controul him?—Have not they the distribution of the loaves and fishes?—And have not their particular friends and favourites eaten and eaten again, till their palates are sated?—What is there they can covet that they do not possess?</P>

Whenever his ******* deigns to talk to me about the inferiority of our fleet—the defection of our old commanders—the deser∣tion of other nations—invasions and such like, I must expatiate on the inundation of our sailors—the great increase of our young officers—our alliance with the powerful Edi∣tor of the Morning Post; with the Charcas, Cherokees, and Chickesaws; and that which we (<HI>ministers</HI> and <HI>placemen</HI>) have made with one another, an alliance superior to all other alliances, and which cannot fail to humble the pride, and punish the perfidy of our combined enemies.—On our inmost re∣sources, our light infantry of tenants and ploughmen, and cavalry of grooms and va∣lets, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2d. If in a fit of the sullens he should complain of our supineness in America, I must strait produce the <HI>wonderful</HI> return of nails, stuffed bags, barrels of pork, puncheons of rum, molasses, bags of salt, keels, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. taken with such risk by Sir George Collier, in his predatory trip up Elizabeth River; and cheer him, by proving, beyond the reach of refutation, that the whole commerce of Chesapeek is at an end, and consequently the sinews of rebellion de∣stroyed.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="26"/>
<P N="3">3d. It is fit his ******* should at length be informed of the impossibility of bringing the Americans to <HI>reason,</HI> abetted as they are by such <HI>mad</HI> allies; but this must be done by progressive hints; a point blank declara∣tion, like a surcharge of electrical vapour, will be too great a shock for his constitu∣tion.</P>
<P N="4">4th. I begin to think we should tempt his ******* with beauty, and give to dalliance some of the hours he devotes to business and impertinent enquiry. It is evident he is be∣coming sensible of our incapability, and it is hight time we furnished him with a mistress in our interests. The Q**** is too wise to exchange peace for politics, and music's charms for war's alarms. I have taken <HI>my</HI> counsel's opinion upon the matter, and she<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is scarce necessary to observe that his Lordship means Mrs. Harvey, <HI>alias</HI> P—ll H—es.</NOTE> (the baggage has her pleasantries) recom∣mends one of the maids of honour <HI>[sans ba∣diner mon cher Milord il en est bien temps que ses dames la deviennent devotes, &amp; se divertent dans le Giron de l'Eglise].</HI></P>
<P>Should we fail in our scheme of seduction, (and I own I am not very sanguine in my expectances) it will then become necessary to strain every nerve, exert every sinew, and rack invention itself to keep him in good
<PB N="30" REF="27"/>humour with himself, and to preserve that cheering aspect of complacency which beams from his countenance. On every arrival of bad news it will be politic to give at least an air of novelty to his amusements. In∣stallations, reviews upon reviews, and trips to the camp must be insisted upon.—In the interval little Pinchey must furnish new trinkets: the fellow is a dab at <HI>the lathe,</HI> and a wit into the bargain. <HI>Similis simili gaudet,</HI> and he may be of use.—West must give up his summer regalements and stick to the canvas. The — loves to set, and Monsieur de Mousin Pouschkin must be told to beg a whole length for the Empress: he may think it not worth the freight up the Baltic; let him; <HI>que s'en suit-il!</HI>—Above all, Sir William Chambers must ply him close with designs. His ******* has taste and fancy, and they must be gratified: gilded tem∣ples and gorgeous palaces must be raised; ancient castles must be modernised; moats must be turned into level lawns, stone walls into iron palisades, and obsolete elms bend their stately tops to flowering shrubs.</P>
<P N="5">5. In haughty imitation of Turgot <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Late minister of the finances in France.</NOTE> have Richmond and Bristol, in their seats, made a tender of their services without salaries. Should the **** hear of this, I must call
<PB N="31" REF="28"/>forth all my powers to convince him that they are either fools, and can be of no service; or hypocrites, and, under a shew of disinterested∣ness, conceal some dark designs or other— But soft—I have said <HI>fool and hypocrite;</HI> not for my place's worth must those jarring sounds escape my lips; far more musical to his ear are Wilkes and Liberty.</P>

<HEAD>EARL OF TEMPLE'S SPEECH.</HEAD>
<P>The Earl began with saying, that he had a full detail of official blunders in his head, and a deep sense of the public calamities in his heart, and they both had co-operated to bring him to the House in despite of age and infirmities, and to make him give the present motion his warmest support. He went over both grounds with his usual cool∣ness and firmness, enumerating various in∣stances of the supineness and ignorance of Ad∣ministration.—Instances which he grieved to observe made a real change of counsellors and councils indispensably requisite to the nation's security. It was impossible their Lordships could be so blind to their interests, as not to see the necessity of a change; and something whispered him within, that they would join with one heart and voice to bring about so happy an event. He al∣ready anticipated a new arrangement, and he prayed heaven it might prove as wise, ho∣nest, and successful an one, as that which in the last war raised the British arms to a pitch of glory unparalleled in ancient or modern history, and of which he was the last sur∣viving member.— <Q>Not (cried his Lord∣ship) “that I am very sanguine in my expec∣tations
<PB N="36" REF="33"/>— so very critical is the state of af∣fairs—that any new men, however wise, will be able to save the nation. The spleen of a pampered people has given place to a sullen and inactive despondency, and it will take more time to quicken and put them into action again, than I fear our enemies will be disposed to give them.—The connections we had most reason to dread, we have just been told are already formed. France has two formidable fleets out, and Spain, we have every reason to believe, keeps pace with her in her armaments.—The House of Austria, forgetful of old benefits, no longet diverts the force of our natural enemies. Prussia has not yet forgotten our breach of faith, and is too wise to trust us a se∣cond time. Even the feeble support of Denmark is not to be depended upon; and the alliance of marriages, which in the South had acquired unusual force for our destruction, has in the North produced nothing in our favour.—Portugal, fensible of our inability to punish her, mocks and insults the very power to which she owes her late deliverance from the invasion of her neighbouring enemies.—Russia has been inclined to assist us; but apprized of our impending ruin, is now prudently loth to involve herself for a people, who must
<PB N="37" REF="34"/>soon leave her to fight alone their despe∣rate battles.—The American trade no longer furnishes the sinews of naval great∣ness, and our late colonies find employ∣ment for the fleet which they used to sup∣ply with sailors. This, my Lords, is the true picture of our present condition—a condition too desperate I fear to be reme∣died by the wisest men. And yet there is a state in all bad things so transcendently ill, that our rulers have left us still some∣thing to deprecate; and I have yet one request to make to them, which is, that they will not involve us in a war with Holland, in a war where we shall evident∣ly be the aggressors. It is true the United Provinces are a pacific nation, which has been closely and firmly connected with us for a century; a nation which naturally wishes for a counterpoise to the power of the House of Bourbon; a nation which has too many millions in our funds to be likely to rise up against us without pro∣vocation—but men can sometimes forget their interests in their passions. The passions of the Dutch are much inflamed, and the immediate object of narrow∣minded merchants may be to suppress a rival in commerce: besides, it is not the interest of any people to be insulted when they can help themselves; and plain men
<PB N="38" REF="35"/>may look no further than this maxim. Our possessions in both the East and West Indies are tempting. To think they will not assert the freedom of their country is weakness; to compel them to it is abso∣lute disgrace: in our negociations with our sew remaining friends let us avoid all crooked and overbearing policy, and act with sincerity, with frankness, with mo∣deration, ”and with honor.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“ As this is the first time I have troubled the House since the publication of a poli∣tical negociation, which was maliciously said to have taken place between my great (and unhappily for this country de∣ceased) relation, and the concealed au∣thor of all our evils, I trust your Lord∣ships will permit me to say a short word or two about that curious story.—My Lords, I took early alarm; my friend's honor, which has ever been as dear to me as my own, determined me, as you may well suppose, to probe the matter to the very bottom. My first enquiry con∣vinced me, that the whole was neither more nor less than the silly plot of an of∣ficious emissary and an idle physician, to bring their patrons to draw together, no doubt, in full confidence that if they suc∣ceeded, they should both be made privy counsellors at least; sure never was so pesti∣ferous
<PB N="39" REF="36"/>a design so poorly executed. Others, my Lords, envious of the spotless cha∣racter the great Earl left behind him, and impotently seeking to sully it, have since thought fit to advance, that my friend was so sensible of the other's wisdom and numbers, as to court an union with him. My Lords, this is an assertion too pre∣posterous for refutation, and teems with absurdity enough in all conscience to stag∣ger the credulity of even Scots, Jacobites, and Tories. That great statesman knew better than to confide in Scotch wisdom, and ever guarded himself against danger when a Tory flattered. He was much too wise to be surprized by courtly infinu∣ations; he saw the snare, and, far from wishing to join the Thane, spurned the subtle advances with the contempt and indignation they deserved. Go, cried he, to the disappointed son of Aesculapius; go tell the officious emissary, that the man he hopes to surprize, loves the King, and people he has once saved, too ardently to join one who has brought them to ruin. Those, my Lords, were his words; and I trust every Englishman will wear them at his breast, till every Scot has lost his influence in the cabinet.—He knew the subtle serpent too well, he had reason to know him too well, to take him into
<PB N="40" REF="37"/>his patriotic bosom; and was too much attached from principle to the Brunswic line to join a Stewart. He had not for∣gotten the story of the old cardinal, who had cast a longing eye upon the papal chair, and who went double, limping, and coughing the cough of a dying man, till he had secured the papal dignity, and then at once became the most arrogant, upright, inflexible tyrant (except one) that ever inhabited that city. My Lords, we want no such sickly, coughing, limping mini∣sters here; and if the Thane possesses only half the wisdom his tools give him, he will quit the kingdom with precipitancy, and sit down for the remainder of his life in France, satisfied with having plunged his generous Sovereign and patient coun∣try into difficulties from which he is un∣able to free them, and thankful that he is suffered to do so. Thus much I promise him—The man whose sole conduct has been one uniform plan to enlarge the prerogative at the expence of popular free∣dom, shall never govern us openly, what∣ever he may do secretly. Pardon, my Lords, this warm language; the subject comes home to us all.—It is the language of an honest heart bleeding for its coun∣try's ”woes.</Q></P>
<PB N="41" REF="38"/>
<P><Q>“I must trespass yet another moment on your Lordships patience. It was rumour∣ed some months since, that, not content with coupling the two Earls together, an∣other emissary, equally officious, was to have taken in the patriotic member for Middlesex, in order to form (as he with as little prudence as wit, and with less re∣ligion than either, called it) a Trinity in Unity, and an Unity in Trinity. My Lords, I have already proved to the satis∣faction of the most malignant prejudice, that my noble relation indignantly scorn∣ed the connection; and I now take upon me to affirm that my friend, the great martyr in freedom's cause, would have ”<HI>squinted at it.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>EDITOR's REMARK.</HEAD>
<P>Convinced by the solid reasoning and unquestion∣able testimonies exhibited by Sir J. W. in his <HI>Audi al∣teram partem,</HI> and at the same time conscious how very sacred the word of a peer is, and how impossible it is for one to assert any thing but what he knows to be as true as the Gospel, the Editor wished much to have suppress∣ed that part of the patriotic Earl's speech, which treats of the political negociation, and most assuredly would have done so, but that he dreaded the imputation of partiality —in his humble opinion the last crime to be forgiven by the Public in an Editor.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="42" REF="39"/>
<HEAD>EARL of G—Y'S SPEECH.</HEAD>
<P>His Lordship, far from blushing at it, said, <Q>He gloried in not possessing, like “some others, that weight of eloquence and volubility of speech which carry every thing with them. For his part he could not see of what other use they were to the possessors, than to render them un∣happy in themselves, and troublesome to their neighbours. That he had with his mother's milk imbibed the utmost horror for rhetoric, logic, and all such pedantic stuff, to which he could never be brought to apply either by private admonition or public reprehension. He therefore humbly begged he might, without excit∣ing the merriment of the House, be per∣mitted to <HI>read</HI> his sentiments which he had brought in his pocket; and hoped their Lordships would not conclude from his adopting that mode of delivering them, that he was indebted to his chaplain for them: they were genuine, and his own to a syllable. He had previously deter∣mined upon <HI>reading</HI> them, for these two plain and simple reasons; first, because
<PB N="43" REF="40"/>it was novel and singular<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Scotch Earl certainly acted a wise part in prov∣ing so incontrovertibly that he could read; but I must take the liberty to deny <HI>the novelty</HI> of the thing. I was myself in the House the sessions before the last, when the late Earl of Chatham moved for General Burgoyne's instructions, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the Earl of G—y, I must insist, did then <HI>read</HI> his speech. If I mistake not, his Lordship's sentiments too in that day's debate were similar to the present.
<P>EDITOR.</P></NOTE>; and next, be∣cause he wished to let their Lordships ”see that he could read.</Q> The noble Earl then took out a sheet of gilt paper and his snuff-box; and, after giving two deliberate taps upon the lid of the latter, and taking a pinch of <HI>Scotch snuff,</HI> unfolded the former; when, to the bitter mortification of all the Whigs present, and to his own immortal honor, he went through the whole manu∣script without spelling a single syllable. The purport of it was— <Q>To signify that he dis∣approved “of the proposed address, and would oppose it with all his might and main. It was true, he came in for his share of the state loaves and fishes, but he opposed the motion from a nobler motive than the fear of losing that share. His place, though worth a thousand pounds a year, he cared not a baubee for. His opposition sprung from the ardent desire he had of prosecuting the present neces∣sary war; and maintaining the supreme
<PB N="44" REF="41"/>right of Great Britain over all her whig∣gish dependencies: to this end he was ready to sacrifice not only the large for∣tune his parent had left him, and his own oeconomy had improved, but the ten sweet little bantlings Lady G—y had borne him: he was alike happy in both; and both were equally near and dear to him; yet he could cheerfully part with them, the last guinea, and last pound of flesh in sup∣port of the present system. He abjured, renounced, and abominated the damnable doctrine of whiggism, and deemed the extirpation of the whole race of Whigs, from the Ear Whig to the Yankee Whig, an obligation paramount to every duty. He had been born and nurtured in Tory principles, and since he came to years of discretion had ever avowed and gloried in them. He would carry them with him ”to the grave, and they should</Q></P>

<HEAD>EARL OF H—T—D'S SPEECH.</HEAD>
<P>His Lordship followed the Earl of G—y.</P>
<P><Q>“He said, he was not <HI>much given to spend</HI> his breath any where, and had ever been particularly <HI>thrifty</HI> of it in that House; but in a matter wherein he was so essentially interested, it would be imprudent, it would be more, it would be criminal to observe his wonted silence. He was as zealous in opposing the address, as the noble Earl who had just been upon his legs could be, though on grounds as diametrically opposite as the hues of their ribbons. Far from being an advocate for the prosecution of the war, he reprobated it with all his heart, with all his mind, with all his soul, and with all his strength; not in the lan∣guage of a noble Duke, as barbarous, fe∣rocious, and nefarious, but merely as an <HI>expensive one,</HI> inspiring the most distress∣ful forebodings, and pregnant with uni∣versal bankruptcy. God knew he had al∣ready felt its effects most sensibly; and on the sacred word of a Peer he could assure their Lordships, that the weekly expences of his table alone had, within the last three years, increased just 20 ⅛ per cent. and if his cook (who had that morning told him that he could get only three eggs
<PB N="46" REF="43"/>a groat) spoke truth, he was confident they would not fall short of 22 ¼ by Mi∣chaelmas. Their Lordships, he was sure, would pity him, when they heard that they last week amounted to the enormous sum of 5<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 14<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 ¾ <ABBR>d.</ABBR>! An enormous sum, indeed; which carried ruin in its eye, and wore fa∣mine in its countenance; and which he defied the most prodigal Peer to view with∣out horror. Under these circumstances, he must be a madman not to oppose an ad∣dress which struck at his very existence; yes, his existence; for, if with the emolu∣ments of his place, he did but barely exist, he should be glad to know what he was ”to do when they were <HI>ravished</HI> from him?</Q></P>
<P>His Lordship went largely into the many consequential evils of war, and dwelt with particular energy on taxes, which, like Aaron's rod, swallowed up all the rest.</P>
<P><Q>“He had ever paid them as cheerfully as his neighbours, nor did he even murmur when they became so heavy that his two dishes and a bottle of claret were reduced to one and a pint of port; but now they were more than flesh and blood could bear. For his part, he wondered when the great financier would hold his hand; he supposed — God forgive him, if he made an <HI>uncharitable</HI> judgment, but he could not help supposing—not till he had with
<PB N="47" REF="44"/>alchymical insatiableness transmuted the teeth in our heads into gold.—The noble Earl who spoke last has said, that he would sacrifice his fortune and children to main∣tain the supreme right of Great Britain over her dependencies. For himself, he held no right in equal estimation with ”that of keeping our gold to ourselves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“And so without more circumstance at all He held it fit that we shake hands and ”part:</Q></P>

<P><Q>“For ev'ry one has his business and desire, <HI>Such as it is;</HI> and for his own <HI>poor</HI> part, ”He wou'd go <HI>pray.</HI></Q></P>
<P>His Lordship concluded his spirited ora∣tion with giving notice that he meant in a few days to move, <Q>That the thanks of “the House be given to the public spirited butcher of Titchfield-street, for his sea∣sonable and exemplary reduction of the ”price of meat, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“My Lords, I do but acquit myself of a common justice in confessing that I have ever beheld with secret admiration, however open my reprobation may have been, that prudence and wisdom, that liberality of sentiment, and unparalleled candor, which have equally distinguished the whole con∣duct of opposition; and although a change of counsellors, so repeatedly urged by the noble Lords on my right hand, for the
<PB N="50" REF="47"/>purpose of saving the nation, has failed of that attention to which it was so justly en∣tled, it is morally impossible its indispen∣sableness can now escape the notice of Ma∣jesty; much less can it meet with the op∣position of Ministry, who must now wish to resign the paltry emoluments of their places, in order to secure their treasures from rapine, and their wives and daugh∣ters from violation. The times are indeed <HI>ticklish;</HI> we have not a moment to lose, and the sooner the new establishment takes place the better. I pant to be re∣ceived into the patronage of our new Mi∣nisters, and flatter myself I need not in∣form them that his Majesty has not a more <HI>peaceful</HI> subject in his extensive do∣minions than myself, or one who seeks with more anxious solicitude to restore to the loyal sons of America that free and independent form of government which they received from their noble ancestors, and which it is so much their ambition ”to hand down unimpaired to their pos∣terity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“My Lords, I should be wanting to myself did I not make this open confession of my sentiments, since an infamous in∣sinuation had gone forth, that America has not a greater enemy in this house than myself. Sure I am my feelings contradict
<PB N="51" REF="48"/>the insinuation, and reprobate its ma∣licious author. Now that the selfish designs of those who promoted this unjust and cruel war are become as glaring as the noon-day lustre of the sun, I trust they will no longer receive that parliamentary countenance they have hitherto done; the unnatural alliance oppressed America has been <HI>driven</HI> to make with France, while it evinces the extremities she was re∣duced to, and leads us to commiserate her sufferings, cannot, I should think, fail to impress our minds with some little trepidation for the safety of the civil and ”<HI>religious</HI> liberty of mankind.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“My Lords, I laud, I honour the op∣position for their pacific system; and were I not aware that I, who have ever been careless of my own honour, should ex∣cite your Lordships merriment by turning champion for the honour of parliament, I would make no scruple of telling you that it is far more honourable to confess and atone for an error, than obstinately to persist in one. No man, I aver, is more peaceable than myself; I love peace, and ensue it; and when I defended the present sanguinary measures, I did it only in com∣pliance with the requisition of the cabi∣net, ”and to secure peace in Jerusalem.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“For my part, though an Englishman, I am a stranger to our characteristic love of de∣bate; and though an enemy to French perfidy an popery I see no heresy, not I, in drinking French wines. Politics I detest as I do water; and know of only one thing more horrid than the trumpet's shrill clangor, and that is the whining of a dun. <HI>Cedat Mars Baccho, concedat laurea viti,</HI> is my motto; and one dozen of Burgundy I aver will do a man more good than all the victories the great Marl∣borough ”gained.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“Nothing promotes harmony and good humour like the sparkling quality of cham∣paigne; nothing so soon changes men from scoffers and opponents to free and friendly associates. Wine gives a zest to rational gratifications, and carries off the foul humours which party breeds around the heart, whilst water is the parent of vapours and mischief. It is the property of wine to open and enlarge the heart, to give strength to our reason, as well as ease and affability to our manners. Water drinkers, on the contrary, contract little habits of thinking, which confirm them in fantastical errors, and terminate in mis∣anthropy. I challenge your Lordships to name one brave warrior that drank wa∣ter, or one eloquent speaker that hated wine. High and low, rich and poor, peer and peasant, lawn and laity, one and all <HI>(&amp; vox populi vox Dei)</HI> join in praising the exhilirating juice of the grape: lawyers alone are advocates for the limpid spring; and for this obvious reason, be∣cause ”in <HI>vino veritas.</HI></Q></P>

<PB N="55" REF="52"/>Lord in the blue ribbon has in corrobo∣ration given us a very moving, and in∣deed a very <HI>pitiful</HI> representation of the enormous increase of his weekly expences. It would be the height of presumption in me to controvert a matter which I am sure my tall friend knows more of than all the Lords (the temporal ones at least) put together; but if I may be allowed to speak of things as I find them, the times are very good and very happy times. The venison I find as fat as it used to be, and claret is both as sound and abundant as ever; as to weekly expences, I can only say I thank my stars those are cares I am an entire stranger to. My creditors think themselves well off, if, like rotten boroughs, they are paid every seventh ”year.</Q></P>
<P>His Lordship concluded his speech with recommending good cheer, which he averred to be the truest wisdom, and a never failing antidote against all evils. Philosophy had accumulated precept upon precept to warn us against the anticipation of calamities: all useless misery is folly; and they that feel evils before their arrival deserve to be wretched.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT is to be done about Sir H. Splice? The poor fellow is inces∣santly teazing me with his ditties and peti∣tions. What he says is true enough; and considering with what <HI>fidelity</HI> and firmness he has fought <HI>our</HI> battles, I think, with sub∣mission to the Lords of the <HI>Sanctum Sanc∣torum,</HI> something should be done for him. There never was so pitiable a wretch, or one to whom the title of Knight of the Woeful Countenance more justly belonged.—He wishes for a trial that he may be restored to the <HI>public</HI> countenance of his patrons, and be able to look his enemies in the face. In my humble opinion, he should, in compas∣sion, be indulged with one, if only to put an end to so forlorn and wretched an existence. Moreover he begins to be saucy and sullen; and dead men your Lordship knows cannot <HI>peach.</HI></P>
<P>I am happy to hear your Lordship's win∣dows escaped so marvelously. Next to the little bows in Pall Mall, mine were unques∣tionably
<PB N="57" REF="54"/>most peppered; <HI>tant meiux!</HI> the K — will love me the better for it; and the public will pay the glazier.</P>
<P>Your Lordship is too good in enquiring thus affectionately after my Love. She has not got the slightest cold, though she had not time to slip on even her <HI>biddy,</HI> and is only a little tender to the touch about the breast, by being squeezed rather too hard by the foot∣man that fled with her in his arms to the Sa∣voy.

<P>That an early trial be granted to the said Vice; whereby it may be demonstrated, to the utter shame and confusion of his malicious and implacable enemies, that the whole fleet of France would infallibly have been taken or destroyed, had not his orders been totally disregarded.</P>
<P>That every possible support and assistance be given to the said Vice on the occasion.</P>
<P>That to counteract the machinations of cor∣ruption and chicane, men distinguished for their justice and integrity, and those only, be selected for the court-martial; and that a pro∣motion

<P>That his house in Pall Mall be repaired by the Board of Works; and that Roberts Taylor, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> be directed to use all possible dispatch in securing it from further depreda∣tion.</P>
<P>That Pennel Hawkins, and William Brom∣field, <ABBR>Esqrs</ABBR> be directed to inspect the state of his leg.</P>

<HEAD>EDITOR's EXHIBITION.</HEAD>
<P>For the benefit of those of my Readers who live out of the world, and may wish to be better acquainted with the group of gaping Tritons, whom Lord Churllow in his Notes has made such honourable mention of, it will not be amiss or unseasonable to <HI>expose</HI> to public view their six shades taken warm from nature.</P>
<P>D. r. y.</P>
<P>Is a man of little reading or observation, of still less professional experience, and no more fit for the chair of justice he has lately filled, than he was to be Chief Justice of the King's Bench. It is however some little apology for him, that he was drawn into it by a couple of lords, whose subtlety and power he was too weak to discern, too timid to resist: till lately he was modestly sensible of his incapability, and concealed himself
<PB N="64" REF="61" MS="y"/>from notice and ridicule in prudent solitude and becoming inactivity. He was deemed an excellent tool, and deluded into business. Poor man! now that he has advanced too far to recede, he finds himself plunged in a sea of trouble. His greatest enemies however confess, that he has been at sea <HI>once</HI> or <HI>twice</HI> before.</P>
<P>D. g. y.</P>
<P>His Lordship was the eleventh that went into action, and the first out of it. He is one of the few whose conduct must have undergone a scrutiny, had Sir H. Splice been condemned. He distinguished himself very much in the trial, by questions which tended to embarrass the witnesses, and lead them to bring out facts in their cross examination that might contradict their first evidence. He has travelled through life with tolerable success, but owes it less to his merit, than to a happy and pliant arrangement of smiles and simpers, joined with a sober mien of gravity, which imposes on the world an idea of wisdom, whilst the most studied courtesy imparts the semblance of friendship. He is almost an exception to the scriptural doctrine, that one cannot serve God and Mammon.</P>
<PB N="65" REF="62"/>
<P>P.</P>
<P>Is to a proverb illiterate, ignorant, ill-bred, and ridiculous; unskilled in his profession, and — in his life.</P>
<P>R.</P>
<P>Is neither a seaman nor a soldier; but he is a very judicious haberdasher of small wares, and keeps the best chandler's shop of any dirty-fingered officer that ever disgraced the service. He too stood or fell with the man he sat in judgment upon.</P>
<P>G.</P>
<P>Is as mere an old woman as Mrs. Old sot, the venerable grandmother of the city; and like her is only fit to be a matron of Green∣wich Hospital.</P>
<P>W.</P>
<P>Is nephew and heir apparent to Sir H. for which very reason it has been contended that he was the likeliest man in the world to find him guilty. Granted; had the prisoner's possessions been intailed upon the judge; but fortunately for the Vice, they are the fruits of his own servility, and he can bequeath them to his nephew or to his bye-blow, or
<PB N="66" REF="63"/>to whom else he judges most worthy of them.</P>

<HEAD>EDITOR'S REMARK on the Sentence.</HEAD>
<P>The first time I had the pleasure of reading this excel∣cellent composition, I pronounced it to be the production of one of the long robe. The marks were too strong to escape the observation of any one the least accustomed to their cant.—<HI>Ex pede Herculem,</HI></P>

<P>The Editor has his opinion too, that nothing but this mockery of j—ce was wanting to fix it beyond all pos∣sibility of future doubt, that the infamous measures against Admiral Keppel had not their origin in the resentment of the impotent Vice, but in the malignity of implacable and all-rulling Tories.</P>

<P>Read at the same time a letter from the Right Honourable Edward Lord Churllow, wherein his Lordship acquaints the Lords of the Supreme Divan, that he has it from un∣questionable authority, that the Right Ho∣nourable
<PB N="68" REF="65"/>Apostate has won no less than four hundred <HI>roulleaux</HI> of fifty pieces each this season at New Almacks; and therefore, with all deference to their Lordships superior pene∣tration, he gives it as his sincere opinion, that <HI>maugre</HI> his present protestation, the noble gambler will, in haughty imitation of other <HI>independent</HI> men, occasionally treat adminis∣tration with contempt and insolence, until a bad run shall bring him to his right senses again.</P>
<P>RESOLVED,</P>
<P>That the Right Honourable Thomas Lord L—n's services have ever been over∣rated, even whilst they were regulated by a consistency of conduct; but that his late puerile versatility has rendered him totally unworthy of the future notice and counte∣nance of Administration.</P>
<P>That a broad hint be given to his Lordship by C—J—n, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> that the imme∣diate resignation of the Justiceship in E—e, will not be considered by the Supreme Divan as an affront.</P>

<P>In a coffee-house, not an hundred miles from a certain fruit-shop, where young men of the ton daily assemble to talk b—y, an Ensign, not less distinguished for the <HI>galli∣matia</HI> of his political controversies, than for his love of putting female modesty to the blush; and a gentleman attached from mo∣tives of interestedness to Governor J—, were disputing upon the separate merits of the two Commissioners Lord C—e and the Governor. When they had gone through their thread-bare arguments, and found them∣selves totally at a loss to proceed a single step further, they proposed a bet, and agreed to appeal to an old gentleman who had been sit∣ting near them the whole time.— <Q>Sir, “(quoth the Ensign, without further pre∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de) on observing that you have been listening to us with some degree of atten∣tion, we have determined to abide by your decision; will you be so kind as to say in one short word, which of the two Com∣missioners ”you think has done most?</Q>—</P>
<PB N="73" REF="70"/>
<P><Q>“Sirs (replied the old gentleman, a man of sly observation and pithy sententiousness) I am not very fond of sitting in judgment; but as I perceive you both to be <HI>warm,</HI> and as by passing sentence I may perhaps prevent you from renewing the subject, and consequently from pinking one another, God forbid that I should not do all in my power to preserve two such valuable lives; so I care not if for once I take the feat of justice. The question you have put to me, if I did not misinterpret it, was, which of the two Commissioners C—and J—has done most?—If you mean <HI>most harm,</HI> I scruple not to give judgment in favour of the young gentleman in scarlet; for I do not remember to have heard of any the <HI>noble</HI> Commissioner has done: whereas it is notorious the <HI>honourable</HI> one has done a great deal, by secretly endeavouring to corrupt several Members of Congress, and thereby making the whole body more in∣dignant against the parent state.—But, if you mean <HI>most good,</HI> I must pronounce it a drawn bet; for the devil of any good has ”either of them done.</Q></P>

<HEAD>EDITOR's REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST REMARK.</P>
<P>The little favourites of great men may be compared to those bright clouds which the sun has raised and shines upon, and which must fall down again upon the earth, out of which they were drawn, as soon as he withdraws his beams.</P>
<P>SECOND REMARK.</P>
<P>The surest way to get rid of an ingrate, is to confer an obligation upon him.</P>
<P>THIRD REMARK.</P>
<P>Of all the virtues which the antients possessed (says a sensible writer) the sincerity of their friendships appears to me as the highest distinction of their characters: their firm attachments has been the constant theme of pane∣gyric, and if we examine their conduct as companions, we shall find that the rites of their religion were not more sacred than the laws of society. Neither the menaces of authority, nor the bribes of corruption, could compel or seduce them into a breach of confidence, No character was so generally odious as that of a betrayer. He was ab∣horred and shunned wherever he went. His discoveries were deemed the effects of malevolence, and received with contempt. Without inveighing against the practice of the present times, or comparing them with that of the past, I shall only observe, that if friendships are no longer to be formed upon principles of fidelity, there is reason to fear that we are placed in the most unfortunate and la∣mentable aera since the creation of mankind. It is not the increase of vices, inseparable from humanity, that alarms us, but it is the absence of that integrity, the neg∣lect of that virtue, the contempt of that honor, which, by connecting individuals, formed society, and without which society can no longer subsist.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="76"/>
<P>FOURTH REMARK.</P>
<P>When Aristotle was once asked, what a man could gain by uttering falshoods; he replied, <Q>not to be credited “”when he shall speak the truth.</Q> The character of a liar is at once so hateful and contemptible, that it might be expected even of those who have lost their virtue, that they should be restrained by their pride from the vio∣lation of truth. Almost every other vice that disgraces human nature may be kept in countenance by applause and association; the liar, and only the liar, is invariably, and universally despised, abandoned, and disowned.</P>
<P>FIFTH REMARK.</P>
<P>It is essential to the very existence of a free government, that the subject should have full liberty to declare his principles and opinions; and every act which tends to coerce that liberty, is tyrannical, and injurious to the community. The press is the medium through which opinions are disseminated among the people. It is the constitutional Censor and controller of princes, the ac∣cuser of bad ministers, and the most efficacious instru∣ment for rousing and forming the people to resist despo∣tism. The liberty of the press is of such infinite conse∣quence in this country, that if the constitution was overturned, and the people enslaved, a man of spirit, with a free press, might soon restore the one, and re∣deem the other: without it, the bravest people can∣not long preserve their rights and liberties.</P>
<P>SIXTH REMARK.</P>
<P>Personal satire against corrupt Ministers, and those tools of power who gorge themselves with the entrails of their country, differs widely from that personal satire which too often proceeds merely from self-love or ill∣nature;
<PB N="80" REF="77"/>the one is written in defence of the public, the other in defence of self: the one is armed by the sword of Justice, and eneouraged not only by the voice of the people, but by the principles of morality; the other is dictated by passion, supported by pride, and ap∣plauded by flattery.</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR HARVEY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Dear Jemmy has this moment ac∣quainted me that your lovely Adonis has given him a promise to accompany you this evening to our <HI>petite assemblée.</HI> 'Tis well known you are not without your influence; do, my dear creature, exert it, and make him come for once in his life <HI>habillé d'une maniere cavaliere.</HI> Upon my word there is no bearing those worsted stockings; <HI>partout rentraits &amp; eclaboussés comme. ils sont.—Ensuite passons en reveuë son habit brun &amp; ancien.—</HI> Joking apart, did you ever see such a curious piece of antiquity? But of all things, com∣mend me to the P—ss burnt caxen,—I shall swoon if I see him enter with that on; that's poz. One would think, upon the rebuke he met with in the Bath rooms from the Master of the Ceremonies, he would have given the hose and the suit to the chairmen that carried him to the pump, and the horse-hair to the first kitchen gardener he stumbled upon, for a scare-crow. But he had none others, and
<PB N="82" REF="79"/>Bath it seems is without its Monmouth-street. Do, my dear girl, try what you can do with the sloven; remind him, that now he is a Peer he ought, for the honour of the Peerage, to appear at least like a gentleman. The mid∣dle path between the foppishness of a C—le, and the meanness of a scavenger, is certainly the fittest, and that which all men should keep who wish to be thought well of by the fair; don't you think so?—But perhaps his Lordship cares as little for their good opinion, as I am told he does for that of his brother Peers.</P>
<P>Give each of your sweet little pledges a couple of kisses for Jemmy and myself.—Adieu.</P>

<P>THE EDITOR has the presumption to hope, that the Reviewers will pardon the little invasion he is about to make upon their rights, by publishing his Critical Obser∣vations upon the foregoing Publications.</P>
<P N="1">1. An Estimate, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>A correct and faithful arrangement of all the members under the separate characters of Whigs and Tories; which, the author tells us in his preface, he has been in∣duced to make, that in case of a revolution in favour of the — family, the new — may, with as little toil as possible, see who have been his good and faithful friends. I make no doubt the author cuts a conspicuous figure on the list, and expects to be rewarded with some lucrative place or other; but however sanguine in their expectations he and the rest of the clan may be from the present state of affairs, I trust it will please a just and kind Providence to interfere in behalf of old England and her present rightful Sovereign. Amen, Amen; with all my heart, Amen!</P>
<P N="2">2. Momus, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Justly deemed the best of all this noble Author's inge∣nious performances. To the moral and pathetic, which before constituted the chief merit of his works, he has here added an original vein of pleasantry, and agreeably blended entertainment with instruction. It is to be hoped his Lordship will not soon be obliged to change his note; or, if I may be forgiven a vulgar expression, that he will not laugh on the wrong side of his mouth.</P>
<PB N="91" REF="88"/>

<P>The public is too well acquainted with the crimes o this <HI>infamous</HI> gentleman, and too sensible of the justice of his sentence, to be imposed upon by an author, who, in his partiality for his friend, has totally lost sight of truth and decency.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Shipwreck, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>I know no body that comes near this noble author in a <HI>catch;</HI> but here he is egregiously out of his <HI>element. Ne sutor ultra crepidam.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The Revolutions of Modesty, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Copper-plates constitute the most valuable part of this loose vulgar performance.</P>
<P N="8">8. Justice, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>A palpable misnomer; the whole bearing evident marks of partiality and predetermined support.</P>
<P N="9">9. Lawn militant, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>A pitiful Canterbury tale.</P>
<P N="10">10. Pandemonium, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Exhibits a very despicable and diabolical picture of the human species; for which the painter deserves a cart's tail, and a total deprivation of every comfort and indul∣gence which can be administered by that humanity, of which he has drawn so unfavourable a representation.</P>
<P N="11">11. An Apology, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>If we are not misinformed, little Isaac has been much assisted by his friends in providing the present entertain∣ment.
<PB N="92" REF="89"/>It certainly is an exception to the old adage of "The more cooks the worse broth." Professed wits are usually severe and satirical; but mirth is the source of Isaac's wit. He seems rather to invite you to partake of his merriment, than to attend to his jests. Had his strokes been general, the person must have been both a churl and a dolt, who did not join in the mirth. The personal at∣tack upon <HI>his two friends</HI> discovers something wrong with∣in, and admits of no palliation.</P>
<P N="12">12. Amours, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>A tickler. Probably first undertaken to relieve a tem∣porary exigence; the profits of its execution being pre∣viously dissipated.</P>
<P N="13">13. An Essay on Man, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Extravagantly silly and puerile throughout. Of the hero of the piece I shall just say, what was observed of Zenobia's hermaphrodite ass, that the creature would not be without its use, if it had but a sex.</P>
<P N="14">14. The Hero's Reveries, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>If publications are to be estimated by the variety and richness of the entertainment they afford, our present au∣thor has a better title to the thanks of the public, than all who have gone before him in the same walk: but let a work have ever so much merit in itself it may lie long neglected, if some circumstance does not immediately gain it the public attention: the author of these reveries was aware of this, and has very wisely insured a favourable first reception, by dedicating them to General Minden; an excellent judge of all literary merit, but of this parti∣cular branch indisputably the best judge in the kingdom. I cannot, in justice to the good taste of my readers, but suppose that most of them are already possessed of this li∣terary treasure, so that what I have said of it, is to be considered as done rather with a view of paying the tribute of praise, where praise is so justly due, than to recom∣mend a work, whose merit alone must have universally
<PB N="93" REF="90"/>recommended it before these sheets can have reached the public.</P>
<P N="15">15. The Temple of Virtue.</P>
<P>It is impossible, consistently with the brevity of my de∣sign, to give the reader a proper idea of this very excel∣lent work. An abstract would convey no juster idea of it than the skeleton of a departed beauty would of her form when she was alive. Indeed the great and just applause with which it has been received by all ranks of people makes it totally unnecessary to say any thing at all about it. Its merit is unquestionably of the very first class; and I am particularly happy in adding my suffrage to the public voice.</P>

<P>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * I began by conquering my own prejudices, and then endeavoured to conquer those of my master.

I feared no∣thing but my conscience; and aimed at no∣thing but the prosperity of the state. I never
<PB N="98" REF="95"/>entered the sacred closet, but I thought my∣self accountable to God and my country for every syllable I uttered in it. I remembered that Great Britain is an island; and that Na∣ture, by detaching it from the Continent, has rendered her situation particularly fortu∣nate, and has pointed out to us in what ele∣ment her chief strength is destined. I che∣rished upon all occasions our naval arma∣ment; and failed not to oppose my voice against any greater number of land forces than were indispensably necessary. I was far from wishing to be the King's only coun∣sellor; or, to express myself more properly, to be his sole minister, to draw every thing within the vortex of my own power, to be at once Admiral, General, Treasurer, Arch∣bishop, Judge, and perpetual Legislator. Such a kind of magistrate is odious to our consti∣tution. I was fond of counsel, and sought it often, but of those only whom I knew to be friends from principle to the reigning Prince. These too were the men I sent forth to fight our battles—they fought, they conquered.—The House of Bourbon was humbled, and ready to sue for mercy at the feet of my sovereign, when the jealous Scot stepped in, and rescued it from that act of humiliation. O my friend! think you we should have seen that perfidious House now

<OPENER><SALUTE>My poor dear LORD, Midnight.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEAVENS! I'm frightened out of my senses, and my trembling hand with difficulty guides the pen. Lappet has this instant brought me word, that violent hands have been laid upon you! but whether by a press gang or the watch she has in her fright totally forgotten. For Love's sake send me immediate word, how and where you are; and whether <HI>bail</HI> or Twitcher are necessary to your releasement. Oh! I shall die if you are not restored before morning to the fond arms of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your ever, ever, ever affectionate, but at present most wretched, HARVEY.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>For the satisfaction of those of my Readers, who may wish to know more of this matter, I shall transcribe an humourous account of it from a letter I received the very next morning from a friend of mine who happened to be present when his Lordship was tapped on the shoulder by the Tar.</P>

<P>"It is a certain fact that Lord Churllow was pressed last night in St. Giles, as he was returning home from e—l, button'd up, as usual, in his old rusty brown coat, slouched hat, worsted stockings, and piss-burnt caxen. You who know the figure and appearance of the man, will not doubt the truth of the fact. He is the first man a press-gang would pitch upon for a sailor, and the last they could suspect of being a gentleman. They took him. He blustered and swore in his usual rough manner; but the very means he took to persuade them that he was a gentle∣man, served to convince them that he was some impudent bullying fellow who wished to make his escape by that means.— <Q>You “a gentleman—you black looking son of a b—, exclaimed the Tar. D— my eyes, I should rather suspect you for a swabber. No, no, bear a hand—You have a d—d fine hulk and good timbers of your own, and we will make you a gentlemen, I ”warrant you.</Q>—He then changed his tone and expostulated in mild terms, but all would not do, and away they hurried his Lordship to the house of rendezvous on Tower Hill; nor was he discharged till six next morning. He dispatched a messenger to his friend Twitcher the moment he reached Tower Hill; but Jemmy enjoyed the joke too much to procure his releasement in a hurry; and
<PB N="102" REF="99"/>(I am told) absolutely sent letters to the lieu∣tenant, ordering him not to discharge him on any score whatever till he came himself there. At six, when Twitcher went to the house, he found his Lordship with three Tars dead drunk under the table; and it was not without some difficulty that he prevailed upon him at last to get into his carriage, so pleased was his Lordship with the jollity of the Tars, and the goodness of the porter he had been swallowing by the gallon.</P>
