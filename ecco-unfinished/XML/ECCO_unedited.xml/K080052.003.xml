<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's APOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with infinite gratitude I review the number of subscribers to this work, and their elevated character, as well in the literary world, as the honours with which many of them are distinguished; and I acknowledge myself highly sensible of the attention the public was pleased to pay to the two first volumes.</P>
<P>It is incumbent upon me, to refer to the public eye the circumstances which have delayed the appearance of this volume, and the adverse events which have embarassed its progress.</P>
<P>In the course of those suits in which I was unfortunately involved, it was necessary <HI>George Allan,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> should be called upon to give testimony both at law, and in equity; a matter in which I laboured with the utmost reluctance, and pursued with every degree of delicacy, that his situation, and the circumstances which my case involved, required.</P>
<P>As Mr. Allan stood forth publicly to give his evidence, and also put in an answer upon oath to my bill in the Exchequer, those facts to which he swore can∣not be doubted or controverted; and I humbly conceive they fully contain my justification.</P>
<P>Mr. Allan having <Q>collected many valuable materials, which he apprehended “were necessary to the compilation of a <HI>History of the County Palatine of Durham,</HI> applied to, and frequently importuned," me "to undertake that work, and he accordingly delivered over many records, together with a variety of manuscripts and printed transcripts, which had been compiled and collected without any chronological order or regularity, and which then lay in his custody unclassed, and in an undigested state."—"And" I "did accordingly compose and write, and ”was solely the author of the work.</Q>—</P>
<P>—At Mr. Hodgson's instance, all the manuscript of the work was delivered to Mr. Allan, for his revisal, before it went to the press, and in his testimony he said, that he verily believed I did <Q>esteem the delivery to be virtually a delivery to the “”use of Mr. Hodgson.</Q></P>
<P>—Being <Q>totally ignorant of the method of measuring and apportioning of “”the printing of works of this kind and extent,</Q> it was not till after the second volume was far advanced in the press, that Mr. Allan discovered to me that the manuscript which remained unprinted would run out so far as greatly to exceed the limits of a second volume; from thence it appeared, that an unforeseen expence would fall upon Mr. Hodgson, which was not provided against in his contract. On this account, "in the latter end of the month of October, 1786," we "took a journey to Newcastle upon Tyne, when" I <Q>voluntarily offered to Mr. “Hodgson to bear the expences of printing and paper, for all such part as should
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>succeed the account given of Sherburn Hospital, at which period it was then ”proposed the second volume should close;</Q> and soon afterwards I signed receipts for the subscription money for the second volume, by which I undertook to deliver the third part to the subscribers gratis. It was then calculated, that such third part would be comprised in about two hundred pages.</P>
<P>The work, as originally proposed to be published, <HI>"was confined within the limits of the rivers Tyne and Tees:"</HI> proposals were made for publishing an addition, but Mr. Hodgson conceiving that it would prejudice the sale of what he had contracted for, the project was given up.</P>
<P>Mr. Allan, in the most generous and unequivocal manner, both in his answer and oral testimony, acquitted me of the delays which had attended the sequel of the work, and declared that he had in his hands the whole manuscript which remained unprinted prior to the month of January, 1790, after it had been revised by me, and much thereof expunged, at the request of Mr. Hodgson. Mr. Allan admit∣ted, <Q>that he was repeatedly importuned by" me, "in the most pressing manner, “to forward the manuscript to Mr. Hodgson, that the printing might be pro∣ceeded in without delay; and believes the several delays which happened in the publication occasioned" me "repeatedly to complain thereof to Mr. Hodgson, and also to require the delivery of the manuscript" by Mr. Allan "to him in the state it then was in his hands. And that in revising the manuscript, and correcting the press and proof sheets, he acted as the friend and assistant of Mr. ”Hodgson in a most especial manner, and without gratuity, promise, or prospect of reward.</Q></P>
<P>The cause at law in which Mr. Hodgson was plaintiff, grounded on a breach of contract for the non-delivery of the manuscript, being at issue, and coming down to be tried at the assizes held for the town and county of Newcastle upon Tyne, at the guild-hall there, in the summer of the year 1793, before the Lord Chief Baron Sir Archibald Macdonald, Knight, and by a most respectable special jury of that liberty; on the opening of the cause by learned counsel, <HI>with all the liberality of the bar,</HI> the court recommended a reference by the parties, <HI>touching all the matters in difference,</HI> under a rule of that court; and it is incumbent on me to acknowledge the high sense of obligation which I entertain, for the readiness with which Jonathan Raine, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Barrister at Law, accepted the office of sole arbitrator; and for the patience and perseverence he shewed in his attention to a long train of evidence, a tedious arrangement of written pleadings, and a voluminous account. BY THIS REFERENCE I HAD THE HAPPINESS TO EXPERIENCE A FINAL PERIOD PUT TO AN EXPENSIVE LITIGATION.</P>
<P>From an unfortunate misapprehension of the tenor of Mr. Raine's letter to me of the 4th of October, 1793, in the advertisement I published, informing my sub∣scribers, that by the decision the property of the work, and the impression which remained undisposed of, were become solely mine, I was led to assert <HI>that the unreceived subscription monies were mine;</HI> for which error I have to beg pardon of the public, it being the arbitrator's intention, that all books delivered by Mr. Hodgson previous to the 18th day of October, 1793, should be paid for to him, and that money to be his property.</P>
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
<P>I should not have troubled my subscribers and the public with so prolix a state∣ment of facts, but to remove any injurious prejudices, with which their minds might be impressed by reports; and I flatter myself they will be convinced, that I was really more than <HI>the reputed author</HI> of the work; and that the delay in the publication did not proceed from me, or had my countenance or assent.</P>
<P>Every endeavour that I could possibly exert was used to prevent the unfortunate suits in which I was engaged; and thence proceeded the voluntary undertaking I made, for payment of such expences as should attend the printing of that part of the work which might overrun the two volumes.</P>
<P>I beg leave in the next place to observe, that though <HI>my original proposal</HI> to deliver the third part of the work gratis proceeded solely from a desire to indem∣nify Mr. Hodgson against an apparent loss, yet, <HI>in due attention to my subscribers,</HI> I have restored the mutilated parts, and replaced what was expunged, so that the histories of the parishes and places between the Tyne and Tees, comprised in this volume, are printed in their original form. Very few of the subscribers, whose names appeared in the first list, have withheld their names from the additional list; and the part which those few in number think proper to accept <HI>gratis,</HI> instead of being delivered in <HI>two hundred</HI> pages, makes up <HI>three hundred</HI> and <HI>fifty-eight</HI> pages, together with many costly plates.</P>
<P><HI>Since the time</HI> of the decision, I have obtained several valuable pedigrees, given with this volume, and for which I acknowledge my obligations to Sir James Riddell, Bart. Sir Isaac Heard, Garter Principal King of Arms, Henry Maire, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Francis Smyth, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mr. Allan, and other correspondents.</P>
<P>The anecdotes of the distinguished prelates, who have departed this life since the publication of the first volume, are drawn from minutes, which, together with the elegant portrait of Dr. Egerton, were obtained lately; and for which I am indebted to gentlemen, whose names, if I was permitted to give them, would add distinction to the list of those personages who have done me the honour of their correspondence.</P>
<P>The account of the <HI>coal</HI> and <HI>lead</HI> trade of this county, which I had prepared as a part of the original manuscript, and had appointed to be inserted under the head of the parish of Gateshead, or of Whickham, Mr. Hodgson withdrew, under an expectation that a friend of his would furnish a complete natural history for this county; that part was not performed; my manuscript on the subject was un∣fortunately mislaid, and was restored to me imperfect. Thus I was thrown into new labours, and the notes on natural history presented in this volume were obtained and composed long after the decision, and too late to be inserted in any other part of the work.</P>
<P>Whilst I acknowledge with gratitude <HI>the great support</HI> which this work has received from a large subscription, and a benevolent public, I must still bear the painful reflection, that by the misfortunes which have followed it, and to which I am not conscious in any manner to have contributed, or been accessary, after <HI>the labours of ten years</HI> in the compilation, I am a sufferer of several hundred pounds, which the work cannot possibly reimburse me.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Since the dedication of the first volumes of this work (by permission) to the Right Rev. Dr. JOHN EGERTON, late Lord Bishop of Durham, it hath pleased God to take that excellent and much beloved prelate from this life. As a duty to the public, the following sketch of his character and conduct is offered to them,</HI></P>
<P>BY THE AUTHOR.</P>
<P>JOHN EGERTON,</P>
<P>THE late Bishop of Durham, was the son of Henry Egerton, Bishop of Hereford, (fifth son of John, third Earl of Bridgwater, by Lady Jane Powlett, first daughter of Charles, Duke of Bolton) who, marrying Lady Elizabeth Ariana Bentinck, daughter of William Earl of Portland, had by her one daughter, and five sons, of whom John was the eldest.</P>
<P>He was born in London on the 30th of November, 1721, O. S. was educated at Eton school, and admitted a Gentleman Commoner in Oriel College, Oxford, upon the 20th of May, 1740, under the tuition of the Rev. Dr. Bentham, after∣wards Regius Professor of Divinity in that university, where he prosecuted his studies extensively and successfully for six or seven years. He was ordained Deacon privately by Dr. Benjamin Hoadley, Bishop of Worcester, in Grosvenor Chapel, within the precincts of Westminster, on the 21st of Dec. 1745, and the following day he was ordained priest, at a general ordination holden by the same bishop, in the same place. On the 23d, he was collated by his father to the living of Ross, in Herefordshire, and on the 28th, was inducted, by Robert Breton, Archdeacon of Hereford. On the 3d of January, 1746, (a short time before his father's death, which happened on the 1st of April following) he was collated to the Canonry or Prebend of Cublington, in the church of Hereford. Upon the 30th of May, 1746, he took the degree of Bachelor of Civil Law, for which he went out Grand Compounder. On the 21st of November, 1748, he was married to Lady Anne Sophia, daughter of Henry de Grey, Duke of Kent, by Sophia, daughter of William Bentinck, Earl of Portland. He was appointed Chaplain in Ordinary to the King, upon the 19th of March, 1749: and was promoted to the Deanry of Hereford, on the 24th of July, 1750. He was consecrated Bishop of Bangor, on the 4th of July, 1756, at Lambeth; and had the temporalties restored to him upon the 22d, previously to which, on the 21st of May, the university of Oxford confer∣red upon him the degree of Doctor of Civil Law, by diploma, and he was empow∣ered to hold the living of Ross, and the prebend of Cublington, with that bishoprick, by commendam, dated the 1st of July. On the 12th of November, 1768, he was translated to the see of Litchfield and Coventry, with which he held the prebend of Weldland, and residentiaryship of St. Paul's, and also the two
<PB N="iv" REF="7"/>preferments before mentioned. He was inducted, installed, and enthroned at Litchfield by proxy, upon the 22d of November, and had the temporalties restored upon the 26th. On the death of Dr. Richard Trevor, he was elected to the see of Durham, upon the 8th of July, 1771, and was confirmed on the 20th in St. James's church, Westminster. Upon the 2d of August following, he was enthroned and installed at Durham by proxy. On this occasion, Dr. Douglas, the Subdean, <Q>“congratulated the chapter and clergy upon their receiving, as successor to the late lamented diocesan, a prelate, whose many well-known good qualities of heart and understanding, and whose line of able and impartial conduct in the dioceses he had left, afforded a sure omen of that steadiness and wisdom of government, which promised equally to promote his own honour, and the ”prosperity of the whole diocese.</Q>—The temporalties of the see were restored to his lordship on the 15th of August, and on the 3d of September he made his public entry into his palatinate.</P>
<P>Though qualified in all respects to fill this exalted station, yet, singular as it may seem, it was never the object of his ambition or desire. He appeared satisfied with his first ecclesiastical preferment, the living of Ross, upon which he constantly resided, discharging all his parochial duties in a manner the most exemplary: and so little anxious was he to obtain a seat on the episcopal bench, that he could not be prevailed upon to use any applications of his own for that purpose, and, with diffi∣culty, permitted those of his friends. This last preferment was unsolicited, and unexpected: he had previously declined accepting the primacy of Ireland, and never extended his wishes to the bishoprick of Durham. Seated here however, he turned his attention to the choice and pursuit of those objects, which his judgment and moderation pointed out as most likely to conduce to the peace and prosperity of the county, over which he was to preside, and to the honour both of his temporal and spiritual government. To accomplish this task required all the address and talent for conciliation, of which he was so completely master. On his taking possession of the bishoprick, he found the county divided by former contested elections, which had destroyed the general peace: no endeavours were wanting on his part to promote and secure a thorough reconciliation of contend∣ing interests, on terms honourable and advantageous to all; and when the affability, politeness, and condescension, for which he was distinguished, meeting in one of his high character and station, had won the affections of all parties to himself, he sound less difficulty in reconciling them to each other, and had soon the high satisfaction to see men of the first distinction in the county conciliated by his<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"Though qualified in all respects to fill this exalted station,"</HI> &amp;c.] This was so generally supposed from a review of his preceding conduct, and is so perfectly true, that it will neither be fit to omit mentioning it, nor proper to ascribe our doing so to a desire of giving his lordship undue praise. In all the several preferments he possessed, he was beloved, admired, and respected: but at Ross, where he lived the longest, and was the best known, his parishioners considered him not only as their rector, but as their friend, their benefactor, and almost as their father; and he had so endeared himself to them, that there was no possible mark of genuine sorrow, public or private, with which they did not, with an admiration almost enthusiastic, do justice to his virtues, and manifest their own gratitude when he left them.</NOTE>
<PB N="v" REF="8"/>means, and meeting in good neighbourhood at his princely table. The harmony he had so happily restored, he was equally studious to preserve, which he effectually did, by treating the nobility and gentry of the county at all times with a proper regard, by paying an entire and impartial attention to their native interests, by forbearing to improve any opportunities of influencing their parliamentary choice in favour of his own family, or particular friends, and by consulting, on all occasions, the honour of the palatinate.</P>
<P>The same conciliating interposition he had used in the county, he employed in the city of Durham with the same success. At the approach of the general election in 1780, he postponed granting the new charter, which would considerably enlarge the number of voters, till some months after the election, that he might maintain the strictest neutrality between the candidates, and avoid even the im∣putation of a partiality; and when he confirmed it, and freely restored to the city all its ancient rights, privileges, and immunities, in the most ample and advanta∣geous form, he selected the members of the new corporation, with great care, out of the most moderate and respectable of the citizens, regardless of every conside∣ration, but its peace and due regulation; objects which he steadily held in view, and in the attainment of which he succeeded to his utmost wish, and far beyond his expectation.</P>
<P>A conduct equally calculated to promote order and good government, he dis∣played, if possible, still more conspicuously, in the spiritual than in the temporal deportment of his double office. Towards the chapter, and towards the body of the clergy at large, he exercised every good office, making them all look up to him as their common friend and father: and to those who had enjoyed the spe∣cial favour of his predecessor, he was particularly kind and attentive, both from a sense of their merit, and that he might mitigate in some degree their loss of so excellent a friend and patron.</P>
<P>In the discharge of all his episcopal functions, he was diligent and conscientious. He was extremely scrupulous whom he admitted into holy orders, in respect of their learning, character, and religious tenets. In his visitations, he urged and enforced the regularity, the decorum, and the well-being of the church, by a par∣ticular enquiry into the conduct of its ministers, encouraging them to reside upon their several benefices, and manifesting, upon all opportunities, a sincere and active concern for the interests and accommodation of the inferior clergy. His charges were the exact transcripts of his mind: objections have been made to some com∣positions of this kind, that they bear the semblance of being as specious as sincere, and are calculated sometimes, perhaps, rather a little more to raise the reputation of their author, as a fine writer, than to edify the ministry, and advance religion.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Freely restored to the city all its ancient rights, privileges, and immunities, in the most ample and ad∣vantageous "form,"</HI> &amp;c.] His lordship granted a new charter to the city of Durham upon the 2d of Oct. 1780. See the copy of the charter, and minutes of the proceedings, from page 37 to page 56, of the second volume of this history.</NOTE>
<PB N="vi" REF="9"/>Of the charges his lordship delivered, it may truly be said, that, upon such occa∣sions, he recommended nothing to his clergy, which he did not practise in his life, and approve of in his closet.</P>
<P>Some years before his death, his health not permitting him to go into the more distant parts of his diocese, he gave a commission to Dr. Law, then Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh, assisted by the archdeacon, to visit and confirm in Northumberland, confining his personal attendance to the county of Durham.</P>
<P>The preferments in his disposal he gave with a truly pastoral care: with many of them he rewarded the provincial clergy, on account of their learning, and other merits.</P>
<P>In a remarkable instance, in which he wished to prefer a particular friend, he declined indulging his inclination, from a conviction, that the person he was desirous to promote, was not entirely orthodox in his tenets, making a covenant with himself, that his affection should not press upon his duty.</P>
<P>The manner and circumstances in which the two valuable pieces of preferment, ***** of Sherborne Hospital, and ***** the First Stall, were given to their present possessors, evinced, in the one instance, the disinterested liberality of the gift, and in the other, the high and sacred obligation of a promise operating upon his mind after the person to whom it was made had been long dead; at the same time that, by disappointing the application of an opulent relation, from whom he had expec∣tations, his lordship lessened such hopes, as otherwise he might more reasonably have entertained.</P>
<P>The hospitality which he maintained at Durham and Aukland, well became his birth and station. Where men share freely of the luxuries they give, it may be difficult to assign the motives of the giver, and exactly to ascertain how much proceeds from genuine hospitality, and how much from the love of personal indulgence. Of his motives, there could be no such doubt: his temperance re∣strained<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"Of Sherborne Hospital."]</HI> He allowed Dr. Dampier, the late Dean of Durham, to resign Sherborne Hospital, when his health was visibly declining, in favour of his son, partly to oblige a mutual friend, and partly out of regard to the dean, and the deserved estimation he was held in at Durham.</NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"And ***** the First Stall."]</HI> After the Duke of Neweastle's death, the Duchess of Newcastle requested his lordship (at that time Bishop of Bangor) to prefer Dr. Cooper, if ever it should be in his power; and he promised that he would. Many years after her death, the First Stall became vacant, and he gave it to Dr. Cooper, who did not even expect it would be offered to him. A very near rela∣tion of the bishop's was at that time within a few months of being of age to take priest's orders, and it might have been kept for him, as an intimate friend of his lordship's, who was then a dignified clergy∣man, and has since been made a bishop, offered to hold it, giving a bond of resignation. His lordship disapproved of bonds of resignation; but that consideration did not weigh with him in this particular case.
<P>It may here casually be observed, that no man perhaps ever had a greater aversion to what in common discourse is called a job. He was too upright to condescend to obtain his ends by artifices or practices, which in any view might have the appearance of collusion.</P></NOTE> <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"An opulent relation."]</HI> The opulent relation was Samuel Egerton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Tatton Park, member for Cheshire, and one of the richest commoners in England. The application was made after Mr. Egerton was old and infirm, had lost his only child, and might leave his property to whom he pleased.</NOTE>
<PB N="vii" REF="10"/>strained him from partaking of what his liberality afforded to others, and he sat daily, with a rigid abstinence, at a table supplied with every delicacy: he took care it should be regulated with the utmost taste: it was plenty under the controul of elegance. His attention, his manners and conversation gave an additional relish to the whole, and made the society of his house complete. Instead of setting apart particular days, as had been customary, his house was always open, always filled by his numerous relations and friends, and the nobility, clergy, and principal families of the diocese.</P>
<P>Such was the wise oeconomy preserved by his lordship, that the expence attend∣ing his hospitality and munificence was no obstruction to his well-directed bene∣factions. Besides many gifts and charities, bestowed on indigent clergymen and their families, and other deserving characters in distress, with a delicacy that gave them a double value, and which, during his life, where industriously concealed, he continued to his death all the bounties he had annually given in his two former dioceses of Bangor, and of Litchfield and Coventry, as well as all the numerous benefactions of his predecessors at Durham, increasing those to the sons of the clergy, whom he was particularly solicitous to support, and those to the infirmary at Newcastle.</P>
<P>To St. Ann's Chapel, in Aukland, to the schools of Wolsingham, Norton, and many other places, he gave particular benefactions; and, whenever it was practi∣cable, he made it a condition of his consent, upon the inclosure of waste lands, that twenty or thirty acres should be given to the living, where it was small, over and above the allotment to which it was entitled.</P>
<P>To the county, in general, he was a great benefactor, as well as to the copy∣holders in particular. He promoted the inclosure of Walling Fen in Howdenshire, which could never have been accomplished without his interposition, on account of the many opposite interests concerned in it, by which six thousand acres were drained and cultivated, and now present the agreeable and useful prospect of nu∣merous farms and cottages, a new town, and a navigation.</P>
<P>He applied to parliament to exonerate the copyholders of Lanchester-fell, and Hamsteel's-fell, of the lord's right to the timber, a measure highly useful and li∣beral; in consequence of which, many trees are planted on a surface of nearly thirty thousand acres, and are become already ornamental to the country, and will in time be useful to the nation.</P>
<P>He consented to an act of parliament for infranchising certain copyholds, in the manor of Howdenshire, for the accommodation and convenience of the tenants, by enabling them to convey their lands, with more ease and safety, and at the same time, without prejudice to the lord.</P>
<P>In the great flood of November, 1771, the whole of the bridge over the Tyne, between Newcastle and Gateshead, was either swept away, or so much damaged, as to render the taking it down necessary. Of the expence of re-building it, the see of Durham was subject to one third, and the corporation of Newcastle to the<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"Navigation,"</HI> &amp;c.] From Market Weighton to the Humber.</NOTE>
<PB N="viii" REF="11"/>remainder. Parliament enabled the bishop to raise, by life annuities, chargeable upon the see, a sum sufficient for re-building his proportion. The surveyors for the bishop and corporation disagreeing, the bridge is not rebuilt upon a regular plan, which was so contrary to his lordship's wishes, that he offered to advance to the corporation, the amount of his one third, that they might undertake the manage∣ment of the whole, and finish it uniformly; which proposal was not accepted. In the progress of this business, he not only consented, that his expence should be enlarged, but likewise that his income should be diminished; for he agreed to the widening of the new bridge, by which the expences of re-building were encreased; and then to alleviate the losses of his tenants, who had houses on the old bridge, he gave them full leases for building upon the new, without taking any fine; but as building upon the new bridge would impair the beauty of it, and be an incon∣venience to the public, he gave up his own interests in the sites of the houses, on condition, that his tenants should have an equivalent on another spot, upon agree∣ing not to build upon the new bridge; and he then procured it to be enacted by parliament, that no houses should, in future, be built upon the new bridge, though the renewal of the leases of the buildings that otherwise might have been erected thereon, would have produced him a considerable income.</P>
<P>The important rights of property, which had been long in dispute between the see and the respectable family of Clavering, were brought, by his means, to an amicable conclusion; and the rights of boundary, which his predecessors had long been litigating, were fully ascertained: and when, by authority of parliament, he granted a lease of the estates in question, for three lives, he gave the fine he re∣ceived for the lease to his lessee of the mines, in consideration of the expences which were formerly incurred by him in defending the right.</P>
<P>It may truly be considered as no small proof of his moderation, that, notwith∣standing, for nearly seventeen years, he held the bishoprick of Durham, in which the rights of property are so various and extensive, the persons with whom he had to transact business so numerous, and in their expectations, perhaps, not always reasonable, he had, during the whole course of that time, but one law-suit: and though there are in these times, certainly no improper prejudices in favour of the claims of the church, that law-suit was, by a jury of the county, determined in his favour. It was instituted to prevent the <HI>onus</HI> of repairing the road between Aukland-park, and the river Wear, from being fixed upon his successors, to whose interests he was always properly attentive.</P>
<P>He adjusted the quota of the land-tax, of the estates in London, belonging to the see, procuring to himself and his successors, an abatement of 13-20ths of what had before been unduly paid; and he greatly increased the rents of the episcopal de∣mesnes at Stockton.</P>
<P>His additions and improvements at the episcopal palaces, offices and grounds, did equal credit to his taste and liberality. Exclusive of such as he made in the castle and offices at Durham, by sitting up the great breakfast room, now used as a drawing-room; and by enlarging and repairing the stables, and their dependen∣cies; at Auckland castle, where he chiefly resided, his improvements were equally
<PB N="ix" REF="12"/>well judged, and much more various and expensive. At the north east entrance of Aukland demesne, which, in the approach from Durham, opens the extensive and magnificent scene of the park and castle, he built a porter's lodge and a gateway, and ornamented these with large plantations: and the new apartments at the south of the castle, which were begun by his predecessors, he completed, and made into a magnificent suit of rooms. The great room he fitted up, and new furnished the chapel. The steward's house, as well as the offices and stables, he enlarged, repaired, and altered into regular buildings; and he lowered the walls of the court and bowling-green, to the great beauty of the scenery from the house. With the monies arising from the sale of the rents and fines in Howdenshire, he bought the Park closes, the Haver closes, and other grounds adjoining to the park, with some houses and tenements in Aukland; he considerably extended the park wall, intending to continue it round the whole: the kitchen garden he greatly en∣larged, and secured it by a stone pier from the river Gaunless: he built another stone pier and wall, to cover part of the park from the ravages of the river Wear; he embanked against the Gaunless in its whole course through the park, and form∣ed in it many beautiful falls. He ornamented the park and demesne lands with various plantations, draining and improving the whole with much judgment, and especially the park farm, which he inclosed. All the grounds he kept in the very neatest order, employing the oldest and most indigent persons in the neighbour∣hood. In Bedbourne wood, he cut several walks and ridings, and totally rebuilt the lodge-house and farm, which presents a beautiful object to the castle.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all these expences, he was liberal and indulgent to his tenants, remitting many fines, and taking no more than one year's rent for a renewal of seven years, or one life: attempts, however, were sometimes made to abuse his lenity and indulgence.</P>
<P>He discharged all the duties of his high and arduous station, with a steadiness that was very remarkable: he not only knew what was right, but acted conform∣ably to that knowledge: though he set a proper value upon the opinions of man∣kind, no man was less under the influence of vain popularity; and when, upon reflection, he had thoroughly satisfied his own mind, regardless of the world and the world's law, he would never suffer the prejudices of others to supersede, and cancel the higher obligations of what he conceived to be his duty. This firmness of disposition, advantageous in so many points of view, fitted him peculiarly for the administration of the great and various powers, with which he was entrusted.</P>
<P>It is not always, that men distinguished in public, appear to advantage in their private characters. We shall consider the life of our late prelate in both these<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"Attempts were sometimes made to abuse his lenity and indulgence."]</HI> A gentleman applied to his lordship to exchange a life, which he stated to be a very good one, and said, that the reason which induced him to make this request, was merely that he had a quarrel with the man, and wished to have nothing to do, even with his name: whereas the fact was, that the quarrel, if ever it had taken place, was certainly made up; and the man, whose life in the lease was desired to be exchanged, was dying, and was attended by a physician at the expence of the lessee.</NOTE>
<PB N="x" REF="13"/>views; and each will throw a lustre upon the other. In the following sketch, we mean to delineate such select traits only, as are not common to all other men, but were more peculiar in him.</P>
<P>His person was tall and well formed, it had both elegance and strength; his countenance was ingenuous, animated, and engaging. By nature, he was endowed with strong and lively parts, a good temper, and an active disposition. Descended from noble ancestors, and initiated, from his birth, in the most honourable con∣nections, his manners and sentiments were cast, from an early age, in the happiest mould, and gave all the advantages of that ease and propriety of behaviour, which were so very observable, even in the most indifferent actions of his life.</P>
<P>In his address, there was a peculiar mixture of dignity and affability, by which he had the remarkable art, both of encouraging those who were diffident, and checking those who were presumptuous.</P>
<P>The vivacity of his spirits and conversation, and the peculiar propriety of his manners, made him universally admired and caressed.</P>
<P>His memory was accurate and extensive. In describing the characters, and in relating the anecdotes and transactions with which he had been acquainted, he took particular delight; and this, when his health permitted, he did with much spirit; and often with the utmost pleasantry and humour, but scrupulously taking care, that the desire of ornamenting any narrative, should never, in the smallest degree, induce him to depart from the truth of it. With so rare and happy a talent for description, with a mind stored with much information, and a memory very retentive, he was one of the most instructive and entertaining of companions: his conversation was enriched with pertinent and useful observations, and enlivened by genuine wit, and humorous anecdote.</P>
<P>He had a very peculiar art of extricating himself, with much immediate address, from those little embarrassments which perplex and confound many, and which often occur in society from the awkwardness of others, or from a concurrence of singular and unexpected circumstances. When pressed by improper questions, instead of being offended with them himself, or giving offence by his replies, he had a talent of returning very ready, and very dexterous answers.</P>
<P>In every sort of emergency, as well in personal danger, as in difficulties of an inferior nature, he shewed an uncommon presence of mind. He possessed a great reach of understanding, and was singularly gifted with a quick and ready judgment,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"When pressed by improper questions,"</HI> &amp;c.] The following are two instances, among the many that might be alluded to:—To a gentleman who indulged rather an unnecessary curiosity, in inquiring of him what he inherited from his father? what was his wife's fortune? and what was the value of his living of Ross? He answered to the first question, "not so much as he expected;" to the second, "not as much as was reported;" and to the third, "more than he made of it."
<P>A gentleman requiring of him the renewal of a lease, upon terms far short of its real value, and the bishop refusing, the gentleman assigned as a reason, why the proposal ought to be accepted, that his lord∣ship was in such a declining state of health, as to render his life very precarious, implying that it was very improbable he should live long: upon this the bishop very readily remarked, <Q>Since that was the “case, the gentleman must be convinced, that his own interest was but a secondary consideration to him, ”and his principal object must be, to do no injury to his successors.</Q></P></NOTE>
<PB N="xi" REF="14"/>deciding rightly upon the instant when it was necessary. No man was better qualified, or at the same time more averse to deliver his opinion; which, upon many occasions, he found a difficulty in avoiding, its value being so well known, that it was often solicited by his friends; and, when he was prevailed upon, he did it rather with the humility of one who asked, than with the authority of one who gave advice.</P>
<P>In forming his friendships, he was as cautious as he was steady and uniform in adhering to them. He was extremely partial to the friendships of his youth, and made a particular point of being useful to those, with whom he had been thus early connected.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that there did not, upon any occasion, exist in his mind, the least desire of revenge. Men who are open and entire in their friendships, are commonly so in their enmities; with him it was otherwise; for, though not with∣out a sense of injuries, he was at all times forgiving. Happy in this disposition, his resentments of course were short, and his friendships lasting.</P>
<P>In all the domestic relations of life, he was exemplary as a husband, a master, and a parent. Instead of holding over his children, an authority founded upon interest, during his life, he put them into possession of a great part of such fortunes, as they would have inherited from him upon his death, willing to have their obe∣dience proceed, not merely from a sense of duty, but from gratitude, and from pure disinterested affection.</P>
<P>Of civil, political, and religious liberty, he had formed just notions, and was firmly attached to the constitution in church and state.</P>
<P>He had an extensive knowledge both of men and things, of which he studiously avoided any display. It may be said with the utmost truth, that in every action of his life, however deserving of praise, he rather declined, than courted it; and whenever any thing that had a tendency to his commendation was accidentally in∣troduced into conversation, either by his friends or dependants, he appeared so far from thinking it his due, rather to suspect the one of partiality, and the other of flattery. This aversion to show and parade, ran through the whole of his character, so much that the several public appearances and processions his station required, which might be considered as a part, and to many would have been a pleasing part of their duty, were irksome to him. The same freedom from ostentation was observable, with regard to his literary endowments, and from that motive, as well as from his abhorrence of controversy, and perhaps, also from a conviction that there were already too many writers, he was ever disinclined to<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"Deciding rightly upon the instant,"</HI> &amp;c.] <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.

<PB N="xii" REF="15"/>write for the public. His merit as a scholar was however well known, and pro∣perly estimated, by such of his private friends, as were themselves distinguished by their erudition.</P>
<P>In the early part of his life he was fond of those manly exercises which give strength and vigour both to the body and mind, without suffering them to inter∣rupt his studies: a practice which, thus regulated, instead of being injurious, is serviceable to learning, and which men, eminent for their judgment, have lamented was not more cultivated and improved. His usual relaxations were such as yet exercised the understanding: chess was his favourite amusement, and he played well at that game. The Greek and Latin tongues were familiar to him, but he delighted most in the Greek. He spoke the French and Italian languages; and wrote and spoke his own with purity and precision. Of books he had a competent knowledge, and collected a good library. In every thing he had a pure taste.—In history, anecdotes, and memoirs, in the <HI>belles-lettres,</HI> in the arts and sciences, and in whatever else may be supposed to fall within the circle of polite education, he was by no means uninstructed.</P>
<P>But the feature which in him was as prominent as it is lovely, was a perfect union of dignity and humility. In society, with persons of his own rank, he maintained his equality; and in his intercourse with the inferior ranks of men, whose vice did not forbid, he stooped with the utmost condescension to the lowest. To all who had any business or concerns with him, he was accessible and sincerely affable, and more especially to the inferior clergy.</P>
<P>Benevolent to man, and reverent towards God, he considered himself in the comprehensive view of one bound by the tie of fraternity to all men; and his whole conduct bespoke him only ambitious, as far as human frailty will permit, of humbly imitating HIM, who is the pattern of all. By good works, he mani∣fested the sincerity of his faith: "True religion," said he, in one of his discourses, <Q>“consists in the love of God, and the love of our neighbour; not in an empty profession of love to God, but in such a love as will manifest itself by faith, obedience, and adoration; and in such a love of our neighbour, as must prove itself to be undissembled, disinterested, and productive of all social virtues. But let us never be unmindful," continued he, "that the first and great duty is the love of God, or piety; for it is this which must give life and spirit to the per∣formance of every other duty: in fine, it is this which exalts our morality into Christianity, and it is Christianity alone which can entitle us to a lasting ”happiness.</Q></P>
<P>His health had been declining for many years, and though he was neither so old nor so infirm as to look upon death as a release, he lived as if he hourly expected it; striving however to preserve life by every proper means, valuing the gift, and<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>"By such of his friends as were themselves distinguished by their erudition."]</HI> Amongst many others, we may name Archbishop Secker, Benson Bishop of Gloucester, Butler Bishop of Durham, the late Lord Lyttleton, the late Lord Egremont, the late Mr. George Grenville, Mr. William Gerard Flamilton, Mr. Ansty, Mr. Richard Owen Cambridge, Mr. Garrick, Mr. Stillingsleet, Mr. J.

He viewed his dissolution, not with the false pride of a stoic, but with the religious indifference of a Christian philosopher. He retained his faculties to the last, and reviewed the main transactions and occurrences of his life, gratefully acknowledging how happy he had been, and how good God had been to him: and when the debt came to be paid, he resigned his breath calmly, and without a groan, and with such compo∣sure and expressions, as seemed to anticipate, in ardent hope, the possession of a better country, and bespoke that the soul and body had agreed to part only for a time, as friends, to meet in truer and sublimer love.</P>
<P>He died at his house at Grosvenor Square, London, on the 18th of January, 1787, and by his own express desire, was privately interred in St. James's Church, under the communion table, near his father.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the frontispiece to the first volume has not been thought to be a good likeness of the late Bishop of Durham, the author has procured another, engraved by <HI>Bartolozzi,</HI> which, in the opinion of his friends, is a striking resemblance.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>LIFE OF BISHOP THURLOW.</HEAD>
<P>WE have also to lament, that during the delays which have attended this publication, THE RIGHT REVEREND THOMAS THURLOW, D. D. who succeeded Dr. EGERTON in the see of Durham, departed this life, after hold∣ing his promotion from the see of Lincoln little more than four years.</P>
<P>BISHOP THURLOW was descended of a Suffolk family, and was the second brother of the late Lord Chancellor of England. He received his academical education at Oxford, and was one of the fellows of Magdalen College; we are uncertain to what church preferments, he was instituted before receiving an appointment by the king, in 1771, to the valuable rectory of Stanhope, in this county, which had then become vacant by the promotion of Edward Keene, as noted in its place in this volume.</P>
<P>Few opportunities offered for DR. THURLOW to display the virtues and benevo∣lence of his mind as a parochial minister; the mastership of the Temple, given him in 1773, and afterwards the deanry of Rochester, in 1777, called his attention to more extensive duties under those appointments: yet the excellence of his character was but a short time exercised in those departments, before he was con∣secrated Bishop of Lincoln, which dignity was conferred upon him in 1779; and therewith he held the deanry of St. Paul's.</P>
<P>Dr. Egerton's death, on the 18th day of January, 1787, opened the way for that high preferment, which our late prelate possessed for so very short a period. He expressed, on all occasions, his taste for those rural pleasures which surrounded him in this palatinate, and he projected many improvements to be made in his episcopal palaces. He laid down certain maxims for the encouragement of his leaseholders; and was ready, on every occasion that offered, to promote the interest and welfare of his people.</P>
<P>It was remarked of him, that "when he was possessed of an extensive patronage in the diocese of Lincoln, he was anxious to seek out, and unsolicited, to relieve indigent merit." His power of indulging those generous feelings of the mind, whilst at Lincoln, was restrained to the short period of eight years;—a much shorter in the opulent see of Durham. He had not an opportunity to grant many promotions in this bishoprick, but the few in number which were derived from him were dispensed with great propriety and judgment. In the discharge of his official duty, he was zealous for the promotion of the true faith and of pure morality; in both sees was said to be a vigilant inspector of the manners and con∣duct of his clergy, and a strenuous maintainer of the discipline of the church.</P>
<P>The bishop was allowed by all men to possess a large share of those mental abilities which have distinguished his family; his comprehension was quick and
<PB N="xvi" REF="18"/>extensive, his judgment sound, and his elocution manly and graceful. Having reaped the advantages of an excellent education, with powerful talents, highly cultivated, his diffidence was remarkable; for, from a singular delicacy of mind, he was not accustomed to exert himself in public, whereby those easy manners, and that elegant and refined conversation which shone in private life, were not displayed in more popular situations. Those who were about his person uniformly speak of him with reverence: his family and friends have suffered an inestimable loss in his death: persons connected with him in his episcopal capacity, or who were honoured with his private intimacies, found him an attentive diocesan, a generous patron, a judicious adviser, an agreeable companion, and a sincere friend.</P>
<P>The prelate died at his house in Portland Place, London, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, universally regretted: his lady supported the sorrows of her melancholy separation but a few months.</P>

<P>FEW families have claims to higher antiquity than that of RIDEL, or RIDDELL, and fewer still have such grounds upon which to establish their pretensions. Indeed the authorities supporting their history, are such as rarely occur in genealogy; particularly at a period so early as that in which it commences.

<P>GEN. VII. A.

Thus never was the origin of any family better ascertained.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The sirname of the family is to be found spelt various ways, as, <HI>Ridel, Riddell, Rydel, Rudel,</HI> &amp;c. and with the Latin termination, <HI>Ridellus, Rydellus, Rudellus,</HI> or sometimes <HI>Ridelli, Rydelli, Rudelli.</HI> A variety of instances might be mentioned, taken both from English and French authors; but we shall here state only the authority of Rymer's Faedera, as being express with regard to the point, and well known to English readers. There we find that the Ridels of Blaye, the descendants of Galfridus, possessing the same lands which he held, and retaining not only his sirname, but also his christian name of Galfridus, have their names written in this indiscriminate manner. The same is the case with the Ridels, Barons of Bergerac, another branch of his descendants, who retained the sirname of Helias for many generations successively. Among many other passages in Rymer's Faedera, compare the following, viz. in the London edition—t. i. p. 351—p. 401—ib.—ib.—p. 410—p. 415—p. 416—ib. —p. 432—p. 462 —p. 555—p. 842—t. ii. p. 647—t. iii. p. 315—ib.—and p. 529.—And in the Dutch edition, 1739 —vide t. ii. pt.

<P>It may be here proper to take notice of a very singular error into which some Scotch genealogists have lately fallen. The family of Ridel has been by them mistakingly considered as the same with another of the sirname of De Ridale. Accordingly they have blended together and confounded the history of both.</P>
<P><HI>De Ridale</HI> is evidently a local sirname, and has its origin from the district of that name in Yorkshire. This might have been very safely presumed, without farther evidence: but such is not wanting; for the fact is confirmed by history and records. Persons of that name were settled in Ridale, in Yorkshire, as early as the middle of the twefth century. One of them, Walter de Ridale, it appears, went into Scot∣land, at the time that David I. sovereign of that kingdom, brought the monks of Riveaux, in Ridale, to settle them at Melros, in Roxboroughshire; and there acquired the lands of Lilisleaf, in the same county. The descendants of this Walter, as well as himself, retained possessions at the same time both in Ridale and Roxboroughshire; so that the origin of the family is clear beyond dispute. Vide Burton's Monasticon Eboracense; Chartulary of Riveaux among Cotton's MSS. and compare Rot. Eboracense 5. Ric. 1.58, 68. ap. Madox's Hist. Exchequer, p. 67, respecting the lands of Brachebe held by Patricius de Ridale, with Sir Robert Douglas's account of the family in his Baronage of Scotland.</P>
<P>When particles before sirnames came to be abolished about the middle of the fifteenth century, the sirname of De Ridale passed into that of this family; the sound being completely the same. This cir∣cumstance, and one or two others that might be mentioned, furnishes an apology for the mistakes of the Scotch genealogists above alluded to.</P>
<P>Another branch of this family of De Ridale, beside that of Lilisleaf, in Scotland, settled at Berwick upon Tweed. Philip de Ridale was mayor of that town, and office which was then of great importance, in the reign of King Kdward I. Whether he was the chief of all the family of De Ridale, or whether he was of a younger branch, we know not; but it seems probable that the honourable family, the Riddells, of Swinburn Castle, are his descendants.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>Jordan acquired the estate of Tilmouth, in this county. In the first year of the reign of King Edward I. he was returned to hold the moiety of that manor. He was the father of William, and grandfather of Sir William, the second of that name proprietor of Tilmouth.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hutchinson's View of Northumb; Charters in the Royal College of Arms; and Record Episcop.

<P>This is the Sir William Ridel, who, on account of his being Constable of Barnard Castle, has served as the occasion of this short abstract of the history of the family of Ridel being introduced in this place. As the transactions in which Sir William was engaged relate to this county, and as they shew not only, that a branch of this family was settled in it at this early period, but that they held a distin∣guished rank, a few particulars deserve that notice here, which those concerning other Ridels, still more eminent, have not found in this narrative, intended, as it is, to give merely an abstract of the descents.</P>
<P>Before being Constable of Barnard Castle, Sir William was Constable of the Castle of Norham, being constituted such by Richard Kellow, Bishop of Durham, as well as bailiff of all his lands, &amp;c. belonging to it; but we are unable to deter∣mine the precise year. In 1312, the very first year of his being bishop, that prelate, as appears by a charter in the College of Arms, granted him several in∣dulgences with respect to Norham. He freed him from paying suit of court, and all castle-rent that should be due to him during his life. At the same time he agreed to render him the sum of ten pounds yearly, as one of his knights.</P>
<P>When Bishop Kellow surrendered Norham Castle to Edward II. for the term of three years, in order that it might be the means of better defending the marches, that prince entrusted the important charge of it to Sir William Ridel, as the bishop had done.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Record. Episcop. Dunelm.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the year 1315, Sir William was appointed High Sheriff of Northumberland. To this office was also annexed the governorship of Newcastle. After this he was constituted Constable of Barnard Castle. In the year 1321, King Edward II. who seems to have held him in high esteem, addresses him as constable of this castle, and at the same time Andrew de Harcla, and some others, as sheriffs and com∣manders in the northern parts, to be ready to co-operate with all the forces they could muster against the insurgents. The great services persormed by them, and their steady attachment, it is well known, enabled Edward completely to crush
<PB N="ix" REF="28"/>this insurrection, headed by the Earl of Lancaster, his own kinsman, and abetted by many powerful noblemen.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Faedera, t. iii. p. 904; and Charter of King Edward II. appointing him Sheriff in the Royal College of Arms.</NOTE></P>
<P>Sir William was employed on several important occasions by King Edward. In 1318, he was joined in commission with two others, to cause forty tons of wine to be distributed to the knights, and other persons of the county of Northumber∣berland, having sustained losses, by reason of the incursion of the Scots. In 1320, his majesty, by a writ directed to Sir William, delegates to him the power of admitting to peace any of the Scotch, who should be willing to return to their allegiance, provided they gave proper security for their good conduct in future. David Earl of Athol, and Andrew de Harcla, were each invested with the like powers. The following year Sir William, with Gilbert de Boroughdon, John de Penreth, and Roger de Horsley, were empowered all three, or any two of them, to grant letters patent for a safe-conduct to John de Pilmor, who was expected to come to treat on the part of the Scotch king.</P>
<P>When King Edward III. mounted the throne, he placed no less confidence in Sir William, whose fidelity to his father had been so conspicuous. In the very first year of his reign, he commissioned him, with four others (Henry de Perci, of the noble family of Northumberland, was one) to cause the terms of the truce with Scotland to be faithfully observed, and to see that the offenders should be punished.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Faedera, t. iii. p. 742, p. 862, p. 865, and t. iv. p. 216.</NOTE> Sir William, however, did not live long to enjoy the favour of his sovereign, for he died the following year, A. D. 1328, leaving issue three daughters, his heirs, viz. Isabella, married to Sir Alan de Clavering; Constantia, the wife of Sir John de Kingston; and Joanna, married to Sir Gerald de Woderington. The lands of which Sir William died seized, were the whole manor of Tilmouth, the manor of Twisel, with the hamlets of Dudhoe and Old Grendon, and the manor of Upsetlington; all in the county of Durham. A small part of these lands was held, during life, by Hugh Ridel, a kinsman of Sir William's, that will be after∣wards mentioned.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inquisition deed in the Royal College of Arms.</NOTE></P>

He died A. D. 1319, leaving an only daughter his heir, viz. Alicia Ridel, married to William Furt, a Baron in Gascony. Her pretensions to the barony of Blaye were doubtful, as it seems to have been confined, like many others, to heirs male only. In which case it ought to have devolved upon Hugh
<PB N="x" REF="29"/>her uncle, after mentioned. Alicia, however, having got possession of it, sold all her rights and pretensions with regard to it, to Edward II. King of England, who had power enough to secure his bargain against any impeachments that could be made against it by a subject; and particularly as it happened that Hugh was at that very time out of favour at court. A clause however was inserted in the deed of conveyance, that should Alicia's rights be rendered invalid, she should lose the greatest part of the purchase money. This deed, by which Alicia transfers Blaye to Edward, (a copy of which is in Rymer's Faedera) is sufficient to shew the very great and extensive privileges annexed to the barony; so much so, that it might, with propriety, be termed a principality.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Faedera, (Dutch edition) t. i. pt.

<P>GEN. XXVI. A. D. 1584.—JAMES (I.)

But as distinct from that of which this is a brief account, as any two families can be, according to what has already been sufficiently pointed out. No one, however, though unacquainted with the distinction in general, had ever supposed, as Sir Robert has done, that this James was of the Lilisleaf family in Scotland. But Sir Robert having seen an old certificate mentioning a James Riddell to be son of Robert, &amp;c. as above, his partiality for families long settled in Scotland (which is well known) led him to conclude, without examining either into its authenticity, or application, to refer it to the James Riddell of this family.— If it is authentic, it probably refers to a James Riddell who was a merchant and burgess of Edinburgh, in the time of King James VI. of Scotland, who had been in Poland, and was father of Patrick, and grandfather of Robert and James (which last is also confounded in some respects by Douglas with the succeeding James of this family) all shopkeepers in Edinburgh.

<P>GEN. XXVII. A. D. 1620.—JAMES (II.) RIDDELL, of Kinglass, in Linlithgowshire, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> This estate he purchased soon after his father's death. He was a man of
<PB N="xiv" REF="33"/>great talents, and of the most exemplary virtues, both public and private. To his patriotic endeavours, Scotland is indebted for the introduction of some of its most valuable manufactures. To these endeavours, his great influence, both in England and Scotland, gave success, as it procured him the concurrence and assistance of some of the most eminent men at that time, and particularly that worthy nobleman, the Earl of Crawford and Lindsay, who, in one manufactory, joined with him in the partnership. Being a man of the most liberal spirit, he was equally respected, during the time of the commonwealth, and afterwards under the newly established monarchical government. For some time he was Commissary General to the parliament's forces in Scotland. Many friendly letters which passed between him and General Monk, together with a passport written, signed, and sealed by the general himself, in Nov. 1659, are still preserved. Probably the general's affection for Mr. Riddell was increased on account of his being descended of Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, consequently of Galfridus or Geoffrey Lord Ridel.</P>
<P>He married on the 19th September, 1639, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of George Foulis, of Ravelstone, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Master of the King's Mint; niece to Sir James Foulis, of Collington, in Mid-Lothian, and to Sir David Foulis, of Ingleby, in Yorkshire, Bart. and aunt to Sir John Foulis Primrose, of Dunipace, Bart. ancestor of the late Sir Archibald Primrose.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ib.

<P>In the year 1351, <HI>Alexander,</HI> of Hilton, and Matilda his wife, the two patrons of the chapel of<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Olim Jesmuther, Jesumunds, probably, Jesus Mount, as it stands high. The chapel was dedicated to the Virgin Mary.</NOTE> Gesmonde, in Northumberland, presented Sir William of Heighington to be chaplain, who was accordingly instituted by Hatfield, Bishop of Durham.</P>
<P>In the 23d, 24th, 25th, of Edward I. Robert de Hilton, of Hilton, in the county palatine of Durham, had summons to parliament amongst the barons of this realm; and in the 4th Edward II. was in that expedition then made into Scotland. This Robert married Margaret, one of the three coheiresses to Marmaduke Thwonge, and left issue two daughters, his heirs; Isabel married to Walter de Penroarden, and Maud to Hotham.</P>
<P>After this there is mention made of Alexander de Hilton, who, in the 7th Edward III. served in the Scottish wars with Ralph, Lord Nevill, and had sum∣mons to parliament, the 6th and 9th of Edward III. but no longer.</P>
<P>This is, in all probability, the same Alexander with the above-mentioned.</P>
<P>John Hilton <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the last of this ancient family, lived in the place of his an∣cestors, which he adorned and beautified beyond what was done in past ages; particularly the chapel.</P>

<HEAD>The Parish of <HI>CASTLE EDEN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the time of Cutheard, bishop of Chester, Tilred redeemed South-Eden, and gave one half of it to the church of Durham to be a monk in that monastery, and the other to Norton to become abbot there. Regnald having usurped the crown of Northumberland, his generals, Scala and Onlafbal, seized on the territory be∣tween Eden and Billingham, and afflicted the inhabitants with grievous exactions.</P>
<P>Robert de Brus becoming possessed of Castle Eden, gave it to the prior and convent of Gisburne, on condition that in ten years time a chapel should be built and endowed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rudd's MSS.</NOTE>. William de S. Barbara, bishop of Durham, afterwards demised half of the tithe to Gisburne convent; and Ivo, son of Adam de Seton, gave the manor of Castle Eden in the time of bishop Farnham<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Hartlepool for the record of confirmation.</NOTE>, which Peter, son of Peter de Brus confirmed; by virtue of which grants the prior and convent enjoyed this place till their suppression, and made this church a donative or curacy, (for the re∣gisters do not shew that ever the bishop of Durham gave institution to it) and so it continued till the dissolution; after which king Henry VIII. in the thirty-third year of his reign, presented to this church as to a vicarage<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Thomas Claxton, in the 5th of bishop Booth, died seised of lands held of the priory of St John of Jeru∣salem, and four messuages and two oxgangs of land, held of the priory of Durham.

Rowland Burdon, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> purchased the manor of — Bromley, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of the county of Warwick.</P>
<P>Mr Burdon has lately rebuilt Castle Eden house on an elegant and extensive plan; the situation is elevated, and commands a good land and sea prospect. To the south, on an eminence separated from the scite of the house by a deep and narrow valley, stands the church, a handsome edifice, erected by Mr Burdon in the year 1764. You enter it through a gateway and portico under the tower, ad∣joining to which is a gallery for the proprietor's family. The nave and chancel are remarkably neat and well lighted; the forms, for there are no stalls, are cover∣ed with scarlet cloth. The font is of beautiful marble, the bason of which is oval; neatness and not ornament hath been attended to in this pious work; touching which a humble memorial is inscribed on a tablet of marble in the vestry-room. The ground round the church is kept in the exactest garden neatness. There are some deep and woody vales or deans near this mansion, which afford many picturesque landscapes: In one point of view from the southward, where the church and mansion-house are both taken into the landscape, the scene is singularly beautiful<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Castle Eden curacy.—Prior of Gisburne pr.

<P>The manor of <HI>Lirtington</HI> or <HI>Lartington</HI> in Richmondshire, in the North Riding of the county of York, belonged, in the time of William the Con∣queror, to <HI>Bodin</HI> who held Rumbaldkirk, and other great estates in those parts under <HI>Allan,</HI> Earl of Richmond. To this <HI>Bodin</HI> succeeded <HI>Bardolf,</HI> his brother, who was ancestor of the Lords <HI>Fitz-Hugh,</HI> father of <HI>Henry Lord Fitz-Hugh,</HI> held the manor of <HI>Lyrtyngton</HI> of the Earl of Richmond, as appears in Kirby's Inquest; and in a return of the fees within the liberty of the honour of Richmond, the said <HI>Hugh</HI> was found to hold in <HI>Ravenswath, Lyrtyngton, &amp;c.</HI> three fees and a half, and the 6th part of one fee. <HI>Henry Lord Fitz-Hugh,</HI> of Ravenswath, died seized of the manor of <HI>Lirtington,</HI> 11th Jan. 1424. <HI>William Lord Fitz-Hugh,</HI> died seized of the same, and other great estates in various counties in Oct. 31 King Henry VI. <HI>George Lord Fitz-Hugh,</HI> a descendant from these, died without issue, 4th King Henry VIII.; <HI>Alice,</HI> the wife of <HI>Sir John Fines,</HI> Knt. eldest daughter of <HI>Henry Lord Fitz-Hugh,</HI> his grandfather, and <HI>Sir Thomas Parr, Knt.</HI> son of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> another daughter of the said Henry, being found by inquisition, cousins, and next heirs, and had liivery of his estates. Upon the division, the chief of the Fitzhugh's lands in Yorkshire were allotted to the Parrs, and probably the manor of Lartington amongst the rest. <HI>William Parr,</HI> Marquis of Northampton, son of Sir Thomas, was attainted in the first year of Queen Mary, and forfeited the greatest part of his estate, which was sold by the crown, and I suppose the manor of <HI>Lartington</HI> was purchased by the Applebys, from whom the Maires inherit.—J. C. B. 1779.</P>

<P>Upon the sea coast lies HARDWICK, an ancient seat of the family of Maires: The mansion-house is surrounded with vigorous plantations of various sorts of forest trees. Lands in Hardwick granted to the convent of Durham, together with a chapel there, as members of Hesleden, were confirmed by Henry II. and also by Richard I. by his charter, dated the 4th of February, in the sixth year of his reign, <HI>cum ecclesia &amp; cum capellis de Eden &amp; de Herdewick.</HI> These acts were ratified by the bull of pope Celestine III.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide cart. &amp; bull pred. in Thesaur. dec. &amp; cap.

It is probable, as no remains of the chapel are now to be found, that it was destroyed in the incursion of the Scots, and never afterwards restored. The records do not point out to us how soon, or to whom this manor was granted out. The first person we find named is John de Denum, who died seised of the manor of Herdwyck juxta Hesilden, which he held of the bishop <HI>in capite,</HI> by the twentieth part of a knight's fee, and was then valued at 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He left his brother

The chancel is near fourteen paces in length, and seven in width, being lighted on the south by three windows under pointed arches: The east window has three lights and a similar arch. The nave is in length about eighteen paces, without any aile, lighted by two windows to the south of three lights each, under pointed arches. There is a large projection or porch, called Thornley porch, on the north side, which opens into the nave by a pointed arch, and half a circular arch supported on a low pillar. The tower projects five paces, and is low.</P>

He was a man of bright genius, highly ac∣complished in polite literature, and possessed a most social vein of affability and good humour, joined with an elegant person and graceful carriage.</P>

<P>THORNLAW, during the time of Cummin's usurpation of the See, was a place of strength, and received bishop William de Sancta Barbara and his adherents for some short time during those contentions, as noted in the annals of that prelate. There are no remains of fortification which can lead the traveller to conjecture what was then the strength of the place: The present mansion-house stands upon an emi∣nence, with deep gulleys or dells towards the east and south, but has no remark∣able situation for defence. Mr Randal had obtained many notes touching the suc∣cession of owners, from the MSS. of Mr John Spearman, which we note, together with the series of evidence in the ancient records. In the year 1190, the first year of Richard I. Peter Harpyn held the manor of Thornlaw, and Sir Richard Harpyn, of Shotton, succeeded him, and was living in 1264<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">About 1198 Peter was a witness to a deed of confirmation made by bishop Philip, of a grant of his pre∣decessor Hugh Pudsey.—<HI>Spearman's notes.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>QUARRINGTON, which in the Boldon Book has the title of Queringdonshire, comprehended Sherburn, Shadforth, and Cassop. The punder of this district had twenty acres as the fee of office, and rendered six score hens and 1000 eggs. In bishop Pudsey's time four carucates of Querrington demesne, with the sheep, stock, and pasture, were in the lords hands. The greve or head-borough man held an oxgang of land for his service, and the smith twelve acres. This shire paid 64 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for cornage, and provided three milch cows.

<P>Under a commission of charitable uses, dated in 1671, it was found by the inquest that Geo. Weardail, Will. Forster, Tho. Hardy, and Anth.

<PB N="15" REF="67"/>Richard Poore, with like consent, gave the manor to that priory in fee and per∣petual alms, which was confirmed by the king. In 1311 bishop Kellaw confirmed both the gifts. After the dissolution, the manor and patronage of the chapel were sold out, and became the estate of the Ropers, who had their family mansion house there; and Robert Roper, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> who died in 1687, sold the manor, with its ap∣pendages, to John Woodifield, of Fishburn, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> ancestor of Woodifield Beckwith, of Doncaster, the present owner.

<HEAD>The Parish of <HI>HART.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The next adjoining parish towards the east is Hart, within which lie the town and port of Hartlepool. Their history is so connected, that we must necessarily take them together. We are left uninformed when Hartlepool first grew into consequence, and to whom it anciently belonged, except only what is found in the Chronicle of Lindisfarn, and quoted in Lambard's Dictionary, p. 145. <Q>Heort∣nesse, “a town in the north partes, which Ecgred, bishop of the holy Isle, builded and gave to the see for ever, together with another called Wycliffe, and some∣what ”before Eardulf fled the Isle.</Q> We are told by Bede, and other church authorities, that the holy woman Bega, under the auspices of the pious bishop Aidan, after setling a short time at Weremouth, chose to establish a religious foundation here for her own sex, about the year 640; but whether the situation she fixed upon was near the sea shore, or further up the country, is left to con∣jecture. The two names of this place found in ancient writers are Heortu, or Heorthu, and Herutey, which commentators agree signify Hartland, or the Isle of Harts; and perhaps the present peninsula was in former times compleatly insulated by the tide at high water, through artificial means, and being covered with a forest, was the peculiar haunt of deer. Under the title Hartlepoole, Tanner's words are, <Q>At or near this place was the ancient monastery called Heorthu, “founded upon the first conversion of the Northumbrians to Christianity, about A. D. 640, by a religious woman named Hieu, or as some copies have it, St ”Bega, whereof St Hilda was some time abbess.</Q> The scite of the house is not pointed out by any ancient name remaining to us: The pious foundress chose the sea shore in Copeland, and the like at Weremouth, whence a conjecture may rea∣sonably be grounded, that she followed the same affection here. St Hilda was her successor, and here Eanfleda, the devoted daughter of Oswi, was received in con∣sequence of her father's holy vow. We are also ignorant of the length of time this house flourished, or when it fell into decay; the great stroke which perhaps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Bedae Hist.

<P>The first material account of this part of the county, subsequent to what is be∣fore noted, is, that before the Conquest, Fulk de Panell having vast territories in England, among other rich manors possessed Hart and Hartness; that Agnes his daughter intermarried with Robert de Brus, one of the attendants of William the Norman, whereupon her father's extensive property passed to that family. This Robert founded the priory of Gisburn, and gave thereto the churches of Hart and Stranton, with their dependent chapels: He was lord of Skelton, Yarum, Danby, and other places in the county of York, and Annandale in Scotland: Robert had two sons, Adam and Robert, and a daughter named Agatha, the wife of Ralph, son of Ribald; and died the fifth of the Ides of May, in the sixth year of king Stephen. Robert, the second son, having Annandale in Scotland, and Hart with the territory of Hartness in England, in the eighth year of Richard I. * an∣swered one hundred shillings upon collection of the third scutage of Normandy, and gave to the monastery of Gisbrough six oxgangs of land in Stranton, and one in Hart<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Wapp̄entag de Sedberg.</HI>

<PB N="18" REF="70"/>it was a place capable of receiving ships and troops from the continent on every emergency, when the northern borders were troubled, and thence the family of Brus were induced to make it a place of strength. We are not informed, save by
<PB N="19" REF="71"/>the Chronicle of Lindisfarn, antecedent to the possession of the Brus's, whether a town was begun to be built here: William de Brus*, who was the grandson of Robert and Agnes, obtained a grant from the crown of a weekly market to be held on Wednesday; and king John, by his charter dated the 8th of February, in the second year of his reign, granted and confirmed to his subjects of Hartlepool, that they should be free burgesses<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Johannes d. g. &amp;c.

<P>The liberty here granted to the burgesses was a freedom to buy and sell without disturbance, from paying toll, pontage, passage money, lastage, stallage, &amp;c. in the markets and fairs in these burghs, and in coming to and going from them, and for these things the burghs were called free burghs, and the burgesses free bur∣gesses, and for nothing else, as is evident from the charters themselves. <HI>Brady's Treatise on Burghs,</HI> 8vo edit. 1777. p. 33, appendix 24.</P>

Thus we observe this place progressively ad∣vancing in importance. The land forms an isthmus, which at high water makes the figure of a crescent, bending towards the south and south west, so that within
<PB N="20" REF="72"/>its extended point ships could lie moored in safety from the storms at north east, and the heavy seas which break upon that coast by the impetuous tides, and influx or current setting up the mouth of the river Tees: Such obvious circumstances, we doubt not, influenced the design of making Hartlepool at once a place of great strength and safety, and the seat of trade; for Robert Brus, son of the last men∣tioned Robert, and grandson of William, <Q>builded the haven and wall about the “towne of Hertlepole, with ten towers on eche syde of the haven, and a chayne to be drawne between them near the haven, which haven would hold a c ”sayle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bib.

Food. vol. viii. p. 572.</NOTE> it appears, that Robert Brus had at Hartlepool, in the liberty of the bishop of Durham, fair and market, assize of bread, and other things, and all liberties belonging to fair and market. A sea port, where he received killage or keel dues, for every ship plying there with a boat 8 d. for every vessel without a boat 4d. and held the prize of fish, &amp;c. But to return to the family of Brus: Robert, the son of William, mar∣ried Isabel, the second daughter of David earl of Huntingdon, and by her had issue Robert, who, in the thirty-fourth year of Henry III. was one of the justices of the Court of Common Pleas, and in the thirty-sixth of Henry III. doing his homage, had livery of the lands of his mother's inheritance. This Robert mar∣ried
<PB N="21" REF="73"/>Isable, one of the daughters of Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester; and in the nineteenth year of Edward I. was a competitor for the crown of Scotland. In the twenty-second of Edward I. he then being stiled Robert de Brus, de Annan∣dale, departed this life upon Good Friday, leaving Robert his son and heir, by his wife Isabel, who dying the thirty-second of Edward I. was succeeded by his bro∣ther, named also Robert, then earl of Carrick, and twenty-three years of age, be∣gotten on Christian the daughter of the earl of Carrick, a second wife. This Robert, in the year 1305, revived the claim formerly made by his father, to the kingdom of Scotland. These claims occasioned a forfeiture of possessions in this county; but either the full operation of the grants of Sadberge was not then at∣tended to, or the king being determined to infringe the <HI>jura regalia</HI> of the bishop on that occasion, gave those forfeited estates to Robert de Clifford, and the bishop of Durham acquiesced therein, or sat for some time under the injury, without a struggle. In Dugdale's Baronage, vol. i. p. 338, we find the Cliffords thus men∣tioned. In the thirty-fourth of Edward I. Robert de Clifford, in consideration of his many great services, obtained a grant from the king of the borough of Hertil∣poole, and of all the lands of Robert de Brus, earl of Carrick, (then called an enemy and rebel) lying in the bishopric of Durham, and belonging to the manor of Herte, formerly given to this Robert for like services. In the first year of Edward II. he joined with that great prelate Anthony, then bishop of Durham, to support the honour and dignity of the king with their lives and fortunes. In the seventh of Edward II. he was slain in the battle of Bannock Moor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide vol. i. p. 277. De terris nuper Rogeri de Clifford datis comiti Richmundiae. Rym.

<P>There are few places in this kingdom give the traveller so perfect an idea of the fortifications of former times as Hartlepool; a long extended wall strengthened by demi-bastions at intervals, some rounded, others square; various gates and sallyports, secured by machicolations and the portcullis; some of the gates defend∣ed by angular, others square turrets; all the variety appearing, which had grown into use in that age. As the wall runs along the edge of the creek, behind the
<PB N="26" REF="78"/>point of land which projects itself into the sea, and from thence turns to cross the isthmus to the opposite cliff, the figure it forms is not regular, giving first a triangle, and then running with a sweep or bend north and eastward. At the <HI>ness end,</HI> or north east point of the wall to the sea, it finished with an acute angle, rising on the brow of lofty rocks: The foundation has of late years been wasted by the washing of the waves, and that part of the wall is now gone: It was exact∣ly similar to the ness or point of the Roman wall opposite to the castle of Car∣lisle. For a considerable space from the sea the wall is much broken, and at the distance of about twenty paces are the remains of a square bastion; from thence about forty paces is a round bastion, projecting from the wall about two thirds of a circle, in girt nearly thirty feet: In the front of this bastion, at the distance of about five yards, is a high ridge of earth, probably cast up by assailants: Of this part of the wall we have given a specimen in the cut. From the round bas∣tion, at about forty paces, is a square bastion about ten feet in front, and pro∣jecting
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> about seven feet from the line of the wall: From thence at about forty∣six paces, is a round bastion, somewhat larger than that before described, making a projection of about ten feet, not so prominent as the other: In all the part described the wall forms a straight line, and the ground gradually inclines and falls from the edge of the cliffs where the wall begins. At the distance of about thirty paces the wall forms an obtuse angle, guarded with a turret or bastion; from whence is a kind of horn-work projecting into the field for a considerable distance, of an angular figure, having two terraces one above another, with the remains of the glacis: The mason work appears through the broken turf. From thence is a very extensive prospect of the sea and coast towards Sunderland, com∣manding Hawthorn Hive, or the beacon point, Easington, Elwick beacon, and a long tract of country. At about thirteen paces from the angle, there is the ap∣pearance of a sallyport, but the wall has been repaired and altered in modern times, so that it is not possible to ascertain more concerning it. At the distance of about sixty paces is a round bastion; at about sixty paces further the great land gate, being the chief entrance to the town from Durham, opening upon a road
<PB N="27" REF="79"/>forced over a level marsh, easily broken up or flooded in a siege. This gate
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> seems to have been strengthened with a wet ditch, and probably a draw bridge. The whole wall, towers, and gateways are of excellent masonry, built of lime∣stone which is won in the sea banks, of so soft a nature in the bed or quarry, that it may be squared with an adge, but when exposed to the air, becomes remark∣ably hard and durable; the arch of this gateway is rib'd, and besides double gates, had its portcullis; the width of the passage is ten feet, and of the whole gateway tower about thirty feet: The projection is not much above a foot from the face of the wall: It appears to have had a strong tower for its superstructure, entered at each side from the parapet of the wall. The approach to the town from this gate was by the side of the haven, which must have made a fine appearance; as the bason, if we may judge from the present slake or morass, consisted of several acres, where a hundred sail might lie moored. From this gateway the wall which secured the haven begins, and runs in a direct line, the water at high tide coming up to the gate. It is somewhat more than eight feet thick, faced on each side with dressed stones, with a parapet guarded by a breast wall and embrasure, now greatly decayed. There is a water gate in this wall, formed by a low, pointed arch, about twenty-four feet in span, and ten feet high, for small crast to pass in and out of the haven without removing the boom chains, afterwards noted: This gateway projects from the face of the wall about eighteen inches, has had flood gates, and also a watch tower, as we apprehend, from the remains of the superstructure. From thence at the distance of about seventeen paces, is a square bastion, about eight feet in front; and nearly one hundred paces distant is another square bastion; and from thence about seventy paces, is a lofty round tower, remaining very per∣fect, save the parapet and embrasures: Opposite to it, at the distance of thirty-six feet, stood another tower, exactly similar in dimensions, as the facia and founda∣tions plainly shew. This was the grand entrance into the haven, and by the space
<PB N="28" REF="80"/>between the towers, one may judge of the size of those vessels which were moored therein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A thirty gun ship is thirty-two feet wide.</NOTE>. This entrance was guarded by large boom chains stretched from tower to tower, the remains of the loops belonging to such chains being still visible in the walls of the tower. At ten paces distance are the foundations of a round bastion, near which is a modern-gate, where it is presumed formerly was a small door way for the convenience of persons landing from boats: At twenty-four paces distance the wall forms an angle, and turns towards the sea: This angle is defended by a half moon. The entrance into the haven had the peculiar security, that vessels coming from the sea must necessarily double the cape or point of the isthmus, and then proceed along the whole range and stretch of the south wall, within reach of the engines and instruments of war, and pass the half moon which guarded the angle of the wall. At the distance of sixty paces from the angle, is a square bastion, and near it a large breach in the wall; from the square bastion, about one hundred and twenty paces, is a large square projection in the wall, most probably modern, about twenty yards long, with a sallyport; and from thence one hundred and twenty paces, is a round bastion; and next stands the gateway, now called the water gate, and which only communicates with the land at low water, and leads to the high street: The arch of this gateway is pointed, about eight feet in width, and defended on each hand by angular turrets, with the points projecting; a figure not very commonly met with in old fortifications: From this gate the wall advances to and buts upon the rock near its point, where the pier or mole begins: The whole of this south part appears much more modern than the north and west sides.</P>

Whereas the burgesses and inhabitants of our burrough or town of Hartlepool, in the bishopric of Durham, have peaceably and quietly, beyond the memory of man, had, held, and enjoyed very many leases, jurisdictions, liberties, franchises, and divers other customs, immunities, and exemptions, as well by prescription, as also by virtue of divers charters, grants, and confirmations, made of old by our predecessors, kings of England, unto the said burgesses and inhabitants of the said burrough, and to their successors.

And the said mayor and burgesses of the burrough of Hartlepoole, and their successors, have a <HI>common seal</HI> to serve them and their successors in all causes and business of what sort soever to be acted or transacted.—And that it shall be lawful for the said mayor and burgesses, and their successors, from time to time, at their pleasure, to break or change that seal, and to make a new one, as it shall seem to them most expedient.

And that the mayor and captial burgesses, the common council of the said town for the time being, or the greater part of them, as often as they shall make, ordain, and establish such laws, institutions, orders, rights, and constitutions in the aforesaid manner, shall make, order, limit, and provide such punishments, penalties, and imprisonments of body, or by fines and amerciaments, or by both of them, to be inflicted upon the breakers of laws, orders, and constitutions, or any of them, or of what kind shall seem requisite and necessary unto the aforesaid mayor and burgesses of the said town, and to their successors, for the better observing of the said laws, orders, and constitutions, so that they may and shall have power to enjoy the said fines and amerciaments, without hinderance from us, our heirs, and successors, all and every of which laws, acts, constitutions, and decrees so as aforesaid to be made, we will that they be observed under the penalties contained in them, provided that such laws be not repugnant and contrary to the laws and statutes of the kingdom of England. And we further will, and by these presents for us, our heirs, and successors, grant to the said mayor and burgesses of the aforesaid town, and to their successors, that they, the aforesaid mayor and capital burgesses, the common council of the town aforesaid, for the time being, or the greater part of them, may, and shall have power and authority from time to time hereafter for ever yearly, and every year, the next <HI>Monday after the feast of St Michael the Arch Angel, to choose and nominate one of themselves, who shall be mayor</HI> of the aforesaid town for one whole year next following. And after he is so chosen and nominated to be the mayor of the aforesaid town, and before he be admitted to execute the said office, he shall take a corporal oath before the last mayor his pre∣decessor, in the presence of the recorder of the aforesaid town, or his deputy for the time being, to execute the said office well and faithfully; and he so chosen, well and faithfully to execute the office of mayor of the said town, shall have and execute the said office for one whole year next ensuing. Moreover we do for us, our heirs, and successors, grant by these presents, to the mayor and burgesses of Hartlepoole aforesaid, and to their successors, that if it shall happen that the mayor of the said town should die, or be removed out of his office within the year after he be appointed and sworn to the office of mayor, that then, and so often it shall and may be lawful for the abovesaid twelve capital burgesses, common council of the said town for the time being, or the greater part of them, to chuse and appoint one of themselves to be mayor of the said town, so that he so chosen and appointed, shall have and execute that office during the remainder of the year, having first taken his corporal oath in form aforesaid, and so often as occasion shall happen. And further we will, and for us, our heirs, and successors, by these presents grant, to the aforesaid mayor and burgesses of the burrough of Hartlepoole aforesaid, and to their heirs and successors, that it any who shall hereafter he chosen and nominated to the office of mayor, or other inferior offices of the said town, or any of them, and he or they having notice or knowledge of the said election and nomination, shall deny and refuse that office to which he or they are chosen and nominated, that then, and so often it shall and may be lawful for the mayor and capital burgesses, the common council of the said town for the time being, or the greater part of them, to commit to the goal him or them so refusing to execute that office or offices, and to impose such fines and amerciaments upon him or them so refusing, as shall seem reasonable to the mayor and chief burgesses, the common council of the said town, for the time being, or the greater part of them, and him or them so refusing to commit to the goal of the said town, and there to detain him or them, until he or they pay, or cause to be paid the said fines and amerciaments to the use of the said town. And moreover we will, and for us, our heirs, and successors, by these presents grant to the aforesaid mayor and capital burgesses of the aforesaid town of Hartlepoole, and to their successors, that whensoever it shall happen, that any one, or more of the said capital burgesses, or common council, of the said town for the time being shall die, or be removed from his place of capital burgess, that then, and so often it may, and shall be lawful for the mayor and chief burgesses at that time surviving or remaining, or the greater part of them, to nominate and ap∣point one of the burgesses of the said town or burrough into the place or places of capital burgess or capi∣tal burgesses so happening to die, or be removed. And that he or they so chosen and approved, having first taken his corporal oath before the mayor of the aforesaid town, shall be of the number of the twelve capital burgesses and common council of the said town; and this as often as occasion shall offer. And moreover we will and ordain, and by these presents for us, our heirs, and successors, grant to the aforesaid mayor and capital burgesses of the town of Hartlepoole aforesaid, and to their successors, that for ever hereafter there may, and shall be <HI>two officers</HI> in the aforesaid town, which shall be called <HI>serjeants to the mace,</HI> for executing process, writs, and other business of the aforesaid town from time to time. And that they, the two serjeants to the mace, to be appointed for the aforesaid town, shall carry gilt and silver maces, engraved and adorned with the arms of the kingdom of England everywhere within the said town, and the liberties and the pre∣cincts thereof, before the mayor of the said town, and his successors, as has been usual heretofore. And moreover we will, and grant for us, our heirs, and successors, to the aforesaid mayor and burgesses of the aforesaid town of Hartlepoole, and their successors for ever, that they, and their successors have, hold, and keep in the said town yearly, and every week in the year for ever, <HI>one market,</HI> to wit, upon <HI>Tuesday;</HI> and also <HI>one fair</HI> yearly, and every year for ever, beginning on the <HI>Vigil of St Laurence,</HI> and from thence to continue fifteen days together, with a court of pye-powder there to be holden in the time of the fair, and as long as the market is kept, with all liberties, freedoms, and customs, to the same court belonging, together with collage, stallage, picage, fines, amerciaments, and all other profits, commodities, and benefits whatsoever, arising, happening, and accruing from such like markets, fairs, and pye-powder courts belonging or apper∣taining. Provided nevertheless, that these fairs be not prejudicial to the fairs next adjoining, and that in the time of the markets and fairs aforesaid, and every one of them the aforesaid mayor, have, receive, and ga∣ther by himself or his deputies, custom or toll, of all manner of merchandise, wares, and chattels of what sort soever they be, bought and sold, as well within the liberties of the said town, as without, and that with∣out the let or hinderance of us, our heirs and successors. And we do give and grant licence to all our subjects, and to every one of them, and of our heirs and successors, that they may have power to give, grant, alien, en∣feof, and assign to the mayor and burgesses of the town of Hartlepool, and to their successors for ever, manors, messuages, lands, tenements, rectories, tithes, rents, reversions, and services, or other possessions, revenues, or hereditaments whatsoever, which are not holden of us, our heirs, or successors in capite, or by knight service, nor by us, nor by any other or others, by knight service, without licence of us, our heirs, or succes∣sors, and without the licence of our lord or lords, from whom the said lands, tenements, hereditaments are holden, so that the lands, tenements, manors, messuages, lands, rectories, tithes, rents, reversions, and ser∣vices, or other possessions, revenues, and hereditaments aforesaid exceed not the value of sixty pounds per annum. And that the said mayor and burgesses of Hartlepoole for the time being, may and shall have power for themselves, their heirs, and successors for ever, to have, receive, sue for, and enjoy the manors, messuages, lands, tenements, rectories, rents, tithes, revenues, and hereditaments aforesaid, which are not holden of us, our heirs, or successors in capite, nor by knight service, nor of any other by knight service, nor without special licence of us, our heirs, or successors, or without the licence of the lord or lords from whom the aforesaid lands and hereditaments are held, so that the said manors, messuages, lands, tenements, rec∣tories, tithes, rents, revenues, services, or other possessions and hereditaments do not exceed the value of sixty pounds per annum, from whatever subject or subjects, and of us our heirs or successors, or from any other person or persons whomsoever. Likewise we have given, and for us, our heirs, and successors, grant special leave, and that without any brief (de ad quod damnum) or any other brief, command, or warrant from us, our heirs, and successors, to be therefore anywise made, desired, or prosecuted, the statute of lands and tenements, ad manum mortuam non ponend, or any other statute, act, ordinance, provision, or restric∣tion formerly had, made, published, ordered, or provided to the contrary, or any other thing, cause, or matter to the contrary notwithstanding. And moreover, we have by these presents, granted for us, our heirs, and successors, to the aforesaid mayor and burgesses, and to their successors, to have and to hold, use, and enjoy to themselves, and their successors, for ever, within the said town of Hartlepoole, and the port of the said town, within, and from the black shore in the river Teese on the south part of the aforesaid town, as far as Black-halls along the sea-shore on the north side of the said town, with so many, as great, and the like privileges, liberties, grants, franchises, jurisdictions, immunities, freedoms, exemptions, and preheminencies whatsover, and of what nature or sort soever they be, as the mayor and burgesses of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne, or any of them, or any of their predecessors, by what name or names soever they were called, incorporated, or shall be incorporated. Provided that they have, or heretofore have had, held, used, or en∣joyed, or might have had, held, used, or enjoyed, in or within the town of Newcastle aforesaid, and the suburbs and liberties of the same, or any of them, by virtue of any charter, letters patent, donation, pre∣scription use, or any other lawful title whatsoever, any undue alteration, uncertainty, contrariety, repug∣nance, negligence, omission, or not true recitation, or any other thing, cause, matter, or any statute, act, or∣der, permission, or restraint, made, published, and provided any way notwithstanding. And further, we will, and of our more ample grace and favour, and of our certain knowledge, and mere motion, do by these presents grant to the aforesaid mayor and burgesses of the town of Hartlepoole aforesaid, and to their suc∣cessors, that they the said mayor and burgesses, and their successors, may have, hold, and enjoy, and shall have power to have, hold, and enjoy, to themselves, and their successors for ever hereafter, within the port and town of Hartlepoole aforesaid, as many, as great, and the like customs, markets, fairs, liberties, grants, franchises, privileges, jurisdictions, immunities, freedoms, exemptions, and preheminencies whatsoever, and of what kind soever they be, as the mayor and burgesses of Hartlepoole, or any of their predecessors, by what name or names soever they were called or incorporated, have heretofore had, held, used, and enjoyed, or ought to have had, held, used, or enjoyed in and within the town of Hartlepoole, and the port of the said town, or either of them, by virtue of any grant, prescription, custom, or any other lawful title whatever, albeit they, or their predecessors or any of them have used, or abused any of the privileges aforesaid through some emergent accident, yet the said mayor and burgesses, and their successors, burgesses of the said town or burrough of Hartlepoole, may hereafter have, use and enjoy the same privileges, and every of them, with∣out any hinderance from us, our heirs, and successors, or any of them, or of our justices, bailiffs, escheators, or any other ministers, or officers whomsoever. Provided notwithstanding, that our well beloved John lord Lumley, his heirs, and successors, shall from time to time, and at all times hereafter have, and enjoy within the town of Hartlepoole, and the limits thereof, all his rights, titles, hereditaments, liberties, and franchises whatsoever, in as ample a manner and form as if these our letters patent had not been made and granted, &amp;c.—In testimony whereof we have caused these our letters to be made patent. Witness ourself at West∣minster, the third day of February, in the five and thirtieth year of our reign.</P></NOTE>, the cause doth not seem to be derived from the natural disadvantages of the situa∣tion, but from the great staples of the country rising in distant parts, and lying
<PB N="29" REF="81"/>upon the rivers Tyne, Were, and Teese, coals and lead being shipped there. The haven now receives small vessels only, and it is distant from large towns: But
<PB N="30" REF="82"/>these circumstances may in part be obviated, so as to restore a considerable trade to Hartlepool: It lies so happily for ships to avoid a storm, that was the haven im∣proved
<PB N="31" REF="83"/>proved it would soon be resorted to: Vessels loading at Stockton have to make a dangerous navigation, forty miles up a river full of shifting sands and various pro∣montories,
<PB N="32" REF="84"/>which greatly retard the passage: Hartlepool lies in a great corn country, and is most commodiously situated for shipping corn and lime. In order to improve the haven and town, it is possible at a small expence to carry a mole cross the slake, from the south-west angle of the town wall to the main land, which would stop the tide from flooding many valuable acres of ground, and occasion a sweep of water to cleanse an extensive bason, where ships would lie in great safety under the shelter of the land, and ply close to the walls, which at a small cost might be converted to a quay for merchandise. Another great advantage the town would derive from such a mole is, that the land communication would be effectually secured, whereas now, at high water, carriages must come seven miles round. The mayor of this corporation is generally a man of consequence in the county, and it is not to be doubted, but some such project might be carried into execution, at once to enrich the place, and benefit the adjacent country.</P>
<P>But quitting this digression, we observe, that bishop Neville granted his com∣mission, dated the 24th of March, in the seventeenth year of his pontificate, for the mayor and burgesses to build a pier or mole, <Q><HI>ad faciend. construend. et erigend. “quandam peram juxta muros ejusdem villae ex australi p'te villae p' salva custodia o'um ”navium &amp; batellor. infra portum i'b'm applicantium,</HI></Q> &amp;c. with a power to collect and receive the contributions of charitable persons; and bishop Booth renewed the licence and enlarged the power. The pier or mole runs out from the point of the rocks towards the south-west, to form the bason or bay, where the ships lie: It has been repaired at sundry times by generous donations; but seems in effect to occasion the bason to wreck up with sand more than it naturally would, in con∣sequence of the channel the tide makes up the slake. Here are several inscrip∣tions, viz. <Q><HI>Lord Vane by his generous subscription first began to repair this pier, “”in the year</HI> 1721.</Q> At the distance of twenty-five yards, <Q><HI>John Hedworth, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> “”mayor of this corporation, repaired twenty-eight yards of this pier.</HI></Q> At the distance of twenty-eight yards, <Q><HI>Anno</HI> 1729, <HI>Henry Lambton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> mayor of this town,

<P>The town of Hartlepool stretches up the western side of the hill, having now only one regular street; at the head of which, towards the north, on elevated ground, stands the church. Of late years here has been a great resort, in the bathing season, and the town is generally crowded with families of consequence: The earl of Darlington has a commodious house here, besides which there are several handsome buildings: The corporation hall, or mansion-house, is modern. On the pasture ground, within the walls, are multitudes of lines and breast works cast up, which from the variety of angles formed therein, appear to be modern, and were perhaps made on the approach of an enemy, when a descent was threaten∣ed some time in the last century, or by the Scotch, who, in the treaty made with king Charles I. on the 26th of December, 1647, were authorised to possess them∣selves of Tynemouth and the town of Hartlepool, (among other northern places) to be their retreat and magazines; and when peace was settled, their forces to be removed, and the castles and towns to be delivered up<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, Rapin, Smollett, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. The coast to the north of the town, for some short space, is very rocky, and the shore has long extended shoals stretching out in spits of sand; but at some further distance is less dangerous, though exposed to a heavy sea from the north-east. The rocks are excavated by the violence of the waves, and are formed into caverns, grotesque arches, piazzas, and other excavations, so as to afford pleasant and romantic retreats at low water.</P>
<P>At some little distance from the church, and nearer to the sea, are the ruins of the friarage. This religious house is noted by Tanner: <Q>Here was a house of “Grey Friars, founded before 1275, and after the dissolution, viz. thirty-seventh ”of Henry VIII. it was granted to John D'oyley and John Scudamore.</Q> Vide Pat. 30 Edw. 3. p. 1. m. 9. There is no valuation on record at the suppression of this house, the Franciscans generally living upon alms, having neither lands or rents. In the year 1275, Walter of Merton, by will left ten marks to the friars here. This was a foundation of Robert de Brus, who came to these possessions by the heiress of Fulk. <Q>The frierage of Hartlepool was founded by the same “Robert de Bruse, (sc. founder of Gisburn) being grey friers of the order of Sainte Fraunces, as I am thereof informed; and for the value of the same house ”yow shall know at my cuming upp<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bibl. Cotton Julius 2. II. Mr Ritson's Notes.</NOTE>.</Q> The present remains bear no counte∣nance of a religious house, being the shell of some mansion belonging to the lay proprietors, built after the suppression.</P>
<P>On the south side of the town, and within a few yards of the water gate, there is a chalybeate spring, which is covered by the sea every tide: It rises very slow, discovers a little sulphur, which soon flies off after taking up; it leaves a white
<PB N="34" REF="87"/>sediment with salt of tartar, becomes whitish with spirits of hartshorn, turns a pink colour with galls, but green with syrup of violets. A gallon yields one hundred and twenty grains of sediment, whereof two parts are nitre, and the rest limestone,</P>
<P>Having now made our progress along the coasts of this county, it seems neces∣sary to observe, that this tract chiefly consists of corn lands: The cattle bred here are small and not of the best form: The sheep are of an inferior kind both in carcase and wool, their improvement having been neglected, and the necessary crosses of the breed unattended to. Excellent horses have been bred in this part of the county, but not many of them. There is one subject to be observed upon, that is even a national concern of much importance, and not less a provincial one; the growth of timber is almost wholly neglected in this extensive and valuable tract: Much of the country being under such a tenure, that the land-holder thinks it inexpedient to grow wood, because he cannot cut it without licence, and pay∣ing heavy dues to the church; thence the want of ornament and shelter is derived, and a most valuable production of the estates is prevented. There are few men whose minds can bear to see the produce of their lands swept away by rapacious hands, or otherwise wastefully suffered to sink into decay, from a prohibition which debars them from reaping it: It would be happy if the legislature should interfere in this matter; or without that interference, if the enlarged virtues and prevailing benevolence of the age, could gain access to the convocations, chapters, and closets of the clergy, to the end they might be moved to correct the servility of tenure which occasions so deplorable a deprivation to the public at large, as well as the private proprietor of lands, that they may be induced to grant a general power to their lessees, to grow and cut timber, and even add thereto by premiums to encourage planting: The advantage to be reaped needs no argument: In order to this purpose, a baneful influence must be corrected; for whilst the unfeeling officer eyes with avidity the fees of licence, his unnatural hand will blight the planter's labour, and, trembling with the grasp of avarice, wither up improvement. Should it be alleged, the project for the maritime situation of the lands is merely visionary and impracticable, let the country along the shores be viewed; see what timber trees lie buried in the sands, the memorials of fallen forests: Seaton pasture, now known only by name, long since incroached upon and covered by the ocean, grew timber of a large size: The whole shore at low water exhibits the stems of trees washed up by the roots, preserved to this day by the moss earth in which they lie: Let attention be paid to the places where trees now grow, that the cause may be ascertained of their being blighted or not prospering, and to the common observers it will be obvious, that there only wants a strong plantation for their nursery. A hedge row, or a small plantation of trees, will not thrive, unable to endure the cold vapour and heavy storms of wind from the sea; it is well known the salt is no cause of injury, as it does not exhale. The fine planta∣tions round Hardwick, and the wood and underwood growing in the deans and various other situations between Shields and Hartlepool, prove the observation: Some trees endure the cold air better than others; the chief of those are the syca∣more and narrow-leafed elm; but under their shelter oaks, pines, and poplars will
<PB N="35" REF="88"/>thrive admirably. The number of acres to be planted might be stipulated in each lease, and the glebe lands of the parochial clergy might also have a share in the improvement, by some wise regulation.</P>
<P>To return to the subject: HART is a small irregular village; the church stands in an elevated situation; the chancel is twelve paces long and five wide, with a large window to the east, and two small windows north and south; it is divided from the nave by a large circular arch. The nave has two side ailes; is in length to the tower fourteen paces, and in width, including the ailes, fifteen paces; the north aile is formed by one short column, supporting circular arches, and is light∣ed by two side windows, and one to the east; the south aile has three small octa∣gonal pillars, the arches a little pointed, two side windows, and one to the east, under pointed arches: The tower is low. In the south wall of the chancel is a figure in armour, cut in relief, slaying a dragon, a cross upon the shield. The font is much sculptured, bearing the emblematical figures of the evangelists, with the figures of Peter and Paul in relief. Robert de Brus, who founded Gisburn, gave the churches of Hart and Stranton, with their chapels, to that priory, and bishop Kellaw, by his charter bearing date the twelfth of the kal. of November, 1311, confirmed to the church of St Mary, of Gyseburn, and the canons there serving God, the donations and confirmations which his predecessors, bishops of Durham, had granted them, with the concurrence of their chapters, viz. the church of Hart and its chapel, the church of Stranton and its chapel of Seton, with all their lands which Robert de Brus gave them, and which Hugh Pudsey, bishop of Durham, with the consent of his chapter, confirmed to their proper use; and all the lands and rents which William and Robert de Brus gave them in the towns of Hert and Hertillpolle, viz. of the street called St Mary's-street, and of other rents in the same town<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon.

<P>The church at Hartlepool, as observed before, stands on elevated ground; the architecture of the most ancient parts, the tower and center aile, shews, that this was once a beautiful building; the chancel has been taken down, leaving merely a recess for the altar, and the side ailes have been rebuilt, near the same period of time. The length of the nave is about twenty-seven paces, and with the ailes fourteen paces wide. The ailes are formed by five pillars on each side, light and clustered, supporting pointed arches, beautiful and well proportioned; the chan∣cel has been divided from the nave by a lofty pointed arch springing from a cluster of pilasters. The church is regularly stalled with oak, paved, and kept with great neatness: There is a gallery on the west end. This church or chapel is dedicated to St Hilda. There are several ancient monuments in the church-yard, but without inscriptions, and the effigies so mutilated as to render it impossible to ascertain to what personages they belonged: They are sculptured in long vestments, and probably belonged to ecclesiastics, and not the families of Brus or Clifford, as has been imagined, it being said they were removed from the chancel: On one is a scrip or scroll falling from the hand, but the inscription defaced. There is a large table monument of blue marble under the east win∣dow, with the arms of Brus, but without inscription, which was in the middle of the old chancel.</P>
<P>There was a chapel in the warren, without the walls, dedicated to St Helen, which William de Brus, who died in the reign of king John, gave for the support of a light at the great altar of Gisburne. Ralph de Whitewell, a bastard, ordered by will, Hugh del Fermory and Roger de Ebor, his executors, to sell a messuage, with its appurtenances in Hartlepool, to raise a stipend for the maintenance of a chaplain to pray for him in the chapel of St Helen, so long as the purchase money would last. At his death, bishop Beaumont seized this messuage, and kept it as an escheat: But bishop Bury, on the 3d of April, 1336, allowed the will to stand good, having found by an inquisition taken before Simon de Grimesby his steward, that Ralph had demised it as his chattel above ten months before he died<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sheriff's Rolls, Auditors Office, Durh.

<P>There were several chantries founded in Hartlepool church. Bishop Skirlaw<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rot.

<P>To the south of Hartlepool lies the parish of Stranton. The village of Stranton is close upon the sea-shore; the houses irregular and scattered: The church stands on a fine mount. The chancel is eleven paces long and five wide, stalled on each fide: The east window has four lights; and there are two windows to the south: On the north side of the chancel an octagonal pillar appears in the wall, support∣ing two elliptic arches, from whence it seems there was an ancient porch annexed thereto. It is divided from the nave by a lofty pointed arch. The nave has two side ailes, the whole length being seventeen paces, and the breadth sixteen paces. The ailes are formed by one pillar on each side, supporting arches rather pointed, but very blunt. In the north aile is an elegant monument of James Belassis, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> with his effigies in the attitude of rising from the tomb, and throwing off a winding sheet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Inscription.</HI>

<P>The remains of the village of SEATON, which have hitherto escaped the incroach∣ments of the ocean, consist of a green, inclosed on three sides with cottages in the form of a square, and a row of houses stretching to the southward along the very brink of the sea banks.

<P>By the records it appears, that the manor and vill of Seaton were the estate of the family of Carrowe, so early as the time of Richard I. Peter Carrowe, in the king's charter made to Hugh bishop of Durham, of the manor of Sadberg, is therein said to hold his lordship of Seaton of the crown by the service of one knight's fee, which service he and his heirs are awarded from thenceforth to ren∣der to the See of Durham, as others the bishops tenants between Tyne and Teese. Roald the prior, with the convent of Gisburn, in the presence of Philip bishop of Durham, A<SUP>o</SUP> 1200, licensed Walter the son of Peter Carrowe, to have a perpetual chantry within the chapel of Seaton, therein to solemnize all church rights; in consideration of which he gave to the convent sixty acres and tofts of land, which Anne his grandmother some time held, with pasturage for one hundred sheep and their lambs. In 1337, John de Carrowe died seised of this manor, which he held <HI>in capite</HI> of the bishop, by homage and fealty, and the service of a fourth part of a knight's fee, and doing suit at the wapontake of Sadberg, with a yearly rent of 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> payable at the bishop's exchequer in Durham, at the feast of St John Baptist, value xx <ABBR>l.</ABBR><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Inq. p. m.

John Hayton and Joan his wife enfeofed Ralph earl of Westmorland in all their lands in Seaton, which the earl gave to Sir John Lumley knight, and his heirs. By the inquisition, taken the fifteenth year of bishop Langley after the death of Sir John, it appears he held the fourth part of the manor by purchase from the earl of Westmorland, an∣other fourth which was the estate of his father Sir Ralph, and a third part held in dower by Isabel the wife of Sir Robert Umfrevill; and that he had besides, six messuages, four falt pits, seven oxgangs of land, and ten acres of meadow, which he also purchased of the earl, rendering to him yearly 19 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 5 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

He made a castle of his manor house of Graystock by the king's licence, and built the castle of Morpeth: Married Lucy daughter of lord Lucy, from whom he was divorced; and afterwards married Joan daughter of Henry lord Fitz Hugh, of Ravenswarth, by whom he had issue, three sons and one daughter: Was one of the commissioners to treat about the ransom of David king of Scotland, taken prisoner at the battle of Durham: Died at Brancepeth, in the county of Durham, and was buried at Graystock, with much funeral pomp.— There were present at the ceremony the bishop of Carlisle, who performed the holy offices, Ralph lord Nevill, Thomas de Lucy lord of Cockermouth, Roger lord Clifford of Appleby castle, Henry le Scrope, and Thomas Musgrave the elder, knights, the prior of Carlisle, and the abbots of Holm-Cultram and Shap. In the chancel of Graystock church is the following monumental inscription: <Q><HI>Icy gist “William le bone baron de Graystock plys veillieant, noble &amp; curtejous chivialer de sa paiis en son temps.

<P>The parish of Elwick, or, as it is frequently called, Elwick Hall, lies to the west. The church stands on a remarkable elevation; the ascent from the dell or gully, which divides this parish from the town of Elwick, is very steep. The approach to the church is by a multitude of steps. The chancel is about seven paces long and sive wide; is ceiled above with wood, and lighted to the east by a window of three divisions under a pointed arch: It is divided from the nave by a low circular arch. The nave hath side ailes; is in length about thirteen paces, and in width, with the ailes, twelve paces. The ailes are formed by rows of three round columns, bearing pointed arches, with this variety, that the capitals of the north row of columns are octagonal, and those of the south row round. The pulpit is placed against the second south column, and the reading desk opposite. The tower is low and heavy, is a separate building, and stands to the corner of the south aile.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Elwick rectory:</HI>—This church is dedicated to St Peter.

To the north-west is a large mount, called the Beacon Hill, well situated for that pur∣pose. This parish consists of about eighteen farm-houses, and the rectors have frequently entertained the heads of all the families at once at their table. It is said, that in this parish there is neither town or village, cottage house for the poor, surgeon or apothecary, midwife, blacksmith, joiner, house-carpenter, mason, brick∣layer, cart or wheel-wright, weaver, butcher, shoemaker, taylor, or barber, school∣master or school-mistress, alehouse, public bakehouse, grocer or chandler's shop, or a corn mill. The glebe lands are in two farms, one of 212 acres, to which is usually annexed the corn and small tithes of five farms within the parish; the other of 133 acres, to which in like manner is annexed the corn and small tithes

The Parish of <HI>SEDGEFIELD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Towards the west lies the parish of SEDGEFIELD. The town of SEDGEFIELD is one of the finest situations in the county, standing proudly upon a swell of gra∣velly ground, open to every aspect, and remarkable for the health and longevity of its inhabitants. The celebrated Dr Askew called this place the Montpelier of the north, and frequently recommended his convalescent patients to it for the be∣nefit of the air. All the country round is in a high state of cultivation; the lands are fertile, well and beautifully inclosed, and many of them near the town bearing a rent of above forty shillings an acre. The center of the town forms a large square, in which is erected a handsome cross, and where a market is held every Friday. To the south and south-east you command a delightful view of Cleve∣land, Roseberry-topping, and a long range of lofty hills, with the borders of the river Tees down to the German Ocean: To the south-west, a beautiful country, where Heighington crowns the distant eminence; the tower of that church is a
<PB N="50" REF="103"/>fine object: The pleasure-house of Crosier Surtees, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> on Shakerton-hill, to∣gether with Brussleton-hill and tower, are seen to the west. On the nearer land∣scape are the elegant works of Mr Burdon at Hardwick; and Sands, the house of Ralph Ord, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> with the grounds neatly cultivated, and many thriving planta∣tions. To the south-west, the plantations and eminences above Raby, Cockfield∣fell, and the heights of Evenwood, are seen; and further northward, but nearer hand, Windlestone-house, the lofty tower of Westerton and Merrington church, and the town of Ferryhill: To the north, the beautiful villa of Mainsforth, the towns of Bishop-Middleham and Fishburn, and on the distant hills the town of Trimdon; and to the north-east, Elwick-beacon.</P>

<PB N="51" REF="104"/>It stands on the east side of the square, in an open and elevated situation; the descent into it is by several steps; the length, from the tower to the screen of the chancel, is about seventy-two feet, neatly stalled, and divided by two regular side ailes; the length of the transept is nearly equal to that of the nave. The ailes are formed by rows of three pillars, light and elegantly formed, each pillar being composed of four perfect cylinders, not placed in a square, but in a lozenge, east and west, so as to present a broad front towards the center of the nave; the columns are belted in the middle, which greatly hurts their beauty; the bases have few members, and those of the old Saxon order; but the capitals are vari∣ously ornamented with fillets of palm branches, vine leaves, wreaths of flowers mingled with birds, and other figures, in many parts delicately pierced. The arches are pointed, and ornamented with mouldings, the outward one zigzag; they spring from pilasters on the side walls, and rise from grotesque heads on the capitals of the pillars. The pulpit is fixed to the first south pillar, and the reading-desk opposite. The nave is lighted by two modern windows in each side aile, and three on each side of the superstructure of the center. There is a good organ at the west end, with a clock in front, which conceals the organist's seat; all neatly ornamented. The font is a large black marble bason, of an octagonal form; each front richly sculptured with arms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoton, Hebborne, Elstobb, Lambton, Pickering.

The chancel is near 36 feet in length, to the four steps which rise to the communion-table; the space within the rails is large and com∣modious. The whole chancel is wainscotted with oak, in panelled work, about eight feet high, ornamented with cherubs; and there are seven handsome stalls on each side.

In the center of the east win∣dow are the arms of the See of Durham in painted glass, impaled with lord Crew's; below, on the dexter side of the window, the arms of the See single; on the sinister, those of Tunstall.

<P><HI>In the north aile is the curious monument represented on the next page.</HI></P>
<P>The learned have been much at a loss to know the meaning of so strange a representation. Perhaps this was the tomb of one of the knights of Jerusalem, as Foxton, in this parish, belonged to that order: In their initiation were used many emblematical insignia and religious types, one of which was expressive of a certain faith of future life and a resurrection from the dead; part of the oath was, that he should not fear to die for the cause of religion: In other religious orders, and especially that much ridiculed society—the free-masons, the candidate is conceived to be under the dominion of death and the corruptions of nature, from whence he is saved by the powers of revelation and christian faith; nothing can be more awful than the ceremony: The similarity is so very striking, that we are bold to deliver this conjecture; but that the reader may determine for himself on the subject, we have transcribed at large what is said on a similar monument in that great work lately published by Mr Gough, intitled, 'Sepulchral Monuments in Great-Britain,' p. ex.</P>
<P>"I shall only mention one monument, which is somewhat peculiar; I mean the representation of a ske∣leton in a shroud, lying either under or on a table tomb. I have observed one of this make in almost all the cathedral churches throughout England, and scarcely ever more than one: but what age to attribute the unknown ones to, I can find no date to guess by, since there is one in York cathedral, for Haxby, treasurer of that cathedral, as ancient as 1241, and in Bristol cathedral. Paul Bush, the first bishop of that See, who died so late as 1558, is represented in the same manner; and I have observed some in every age between."</P>
<P>"The least degree of reflection would have shewn, that the figure here alluded to, which has created an unnecessary perplexity with several curious persons, and given rise to the foolish tales of vergers and sex∣tons<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The common story told by the sextons who shew the churches where these tombs are found, is, that the person re∣presented, endeavoured, in imitation of Christ, to fast 40 days, but died in the attempt, having reduced himself from the figure represented above to the state shewn below; or that by a long sickness he was, from a fine lusty man, brought down to the skeleton there exhibited. Both these are in fact vulgar errors, calculated to astonish their holiday visitors: <HI>For by these sculptures it was only meant to inculcate the vanity and mutability of human felicity and greatness, and to remind the spectators, that every man, however rich, powerful, dignified, adorned, or handsome, must inevitably, some time or other, put on the disgusting appearance there represented.</HI></NOTE>, was nothing more than a striking exemplification of the change of condition made by death, con∣trasted with the appearance of the party on the upper part of the tomb." The author enumerates several instances, beginning with the tomb of bishop Fleming, at Lincoln, 1431. "Lay figures of this kind are not very common among us, except one of the countess of Suffolk, at Ewelme," &amp;c. &amp;c.; with some other instances." "Mr Blomfield calls these figures in brass, effigies looking out of their winding-sheets; Sal∣mon says of such at Hitchin, that they are effigies of men and women, with part of their habits tied above their heads, the woman's hair hanging down at each side like a long peruke. In Sabridgeworth church are a man and woman so apparelled, holding each a heart; others on brasses of the 15th, 16th, and 17th cen∣turies, in St Lawrence's church, Norwich; others in Sedgefield and Stranton churches, in the county of Durham."</P></NOTE>.</P>

We find in this manor a common kiln, which probably served for both malt and oats. The bond tenants were under great servility; for besides the various payments in scat or exchequer oats and money, &amp;c. for thirty acres which each bondsman held, he wrought three days in every week for the lord, except at Easter and Whitsuntide, and twelve days at Christmas: At certain kinds of labour he had the bishop's allowance of his corrody, or a loaf of bread, for they are distinct; and in the corrody we may thence conjecture there was no al∣lowance of bread. None of the records shew what the corrody consisted of; but it is probable it was a mash of oatmeal, such large provision of that kind being made in the dry rents reserved for the lands. It appears there was a moor be∣longing to Sedgefield, called Le Brok.</P>
<P>Sedgefield was first made a market town, by grant from bishop Kellawe, in the year 1312; with a fair for five days, to be holden on the eve of Edmund, arch∣bishop of Canterbury, and on the three following days.

<P>1782, Oct. 19. John Lowther, of Church-street, in the parish of St Oswald, near the city of Durham, by his will of this date, after bequeathing several legacies, amongst which are fifty pounds to the poor of St Oswald's parish, Durham, and fifty pounds to the poor of Sedgefield parish, takes notice, that he is possessed of two thousand pounds three per cent. bank annuities, 1400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> of which he disposes of; and then says, "And as to the remaining <HI>six hundred pounds</HI> three per cent bank annuities, upon trust, to transfer and settle the same, so as to become vested in Ann Lowther, Ralph Ord, and Nicholas Chilton, (the exe∣cutors) and Mr William Wrightson, of Sedgefield, surgeon, and the rector of Sedgefield for the time being, upon the trusts, and to and for the intents and purposes herein after mentioned; (that is to say) upon trust, to pay and apply the interest, produce, and dividends of the said six hundred pounds, from time to time, as the same shall hereafter be received and receivable, <HI>for and towards the education and cloathing of such poor female children</HI> as I have now placed at school at Sedgefield aforesaid, or which I shall, during my na∣tural life, place at school there, and such other poor female children as the said Ann Lowther, Ralph Ord, Nicholas Chilton, William Wrightson, and the rector of Sedgefield aforesaid, for the time being, or their successors, to be nominated as herein after mentioned, or any three of them, or their successors, shall think proper objects to place at the said school; and for the better carrying this part of my will into execution, and for perpetuating and to fulfil my charitable intentions, I do direct, that when and so soon as my said trustees, Ann Lowther, Ralph Ord, Nicholas Chilton, or William Wrightson, shall, by death or other∣wise, be reduced to three, then such three, or the survivors or survivor of them, and the rector of Sedge∣field, for the time being, shall thereupon forth with elect, nominate, and make choice of so many and other fit and proper person or persons to be trustees or trustee, as, together with the remaining trustees or trustee, for the purposes aforesaid, shall then compleat and make up the number of trustees, with the said rector, five; and that thereupon, and so soon as conveniently may be after such choice as aforesaid, the then re∣maining trustees, or the survivors of survivor of them, shall well and sufficiently transfer the said six hun∣dred pounds, three per cent bank annuities, so and in such manner as that the same may become legally vested in the said remaining trustees or trustee, and such new trustees or trustee to be nominated and elect∣ed as aforesaid, their executors, administrators, and assigns, respectively, upon the trusts, and to and for the intents and purposes aforesaid; and so from time to time, and as often as the said trustees for the time being, of the said six hundred pounds, three per cent. bank annuities, shall, by death or otherwise, be re∣duced to the number of three; to the end that the same premisses may not at any time hereafter come to or vest in the executors or administrators of any single surviving trustee."</P>
<P>N. B. Mr Lowther, the testator, was born at Sedgefield, and died at his house in Durham, 19th of Sep∣tember, 1785, aged 74 years.—The will was proved in the ecclesiastical court at Durham, and also in the prerogative court of Canterbury.</P></NOTE>.</Q></P>

<PB N="65" REF="119"/>called Howle-hope. The election of the master is in the rector and vestry. Six poor children are taught here gratis.—The school-house is situated on the east side of the Market-square, adjoining to Cooper's hospital.</P>
<P>To the west of Sedgefield, about half a mile, lies HARDWICK, the seat of John Burdon, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the most beautiful places in the county; where, as Pope says, <HI>'Gods might wander with delight.'</HI> The pleasure-grounds are laid out with exquisite taste, and the ornaments are supremely elegant. The walks and plantations are formed on an easy inclination, facing to the west; and a fine bason of water covers the hollow between the rising grounds. Mr Burdon shows a distinguished liberality to the public by the free admission of all visiters. On entering the gardener's gate, you pass the wood by a serpentine walk which leads to the grand terrace, a gravel walk about 24 feet in width, and upwards of 560 paces in length: At this point of view (looking over a circular bason of water) the bath-house terminates the prospect at one end, and the tower of Sedgefield church at the other: Advancing a little further, you pass the wood, and come in∣stantly to a view of the finest sheet of water in the north of England, consisting of 36 acres, margined with grass slopes, plantations of flowering shrubs and ever∣greens, thickened with forest trees behind; all kep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the greatest order and ex∣actness. A serpentine canal runs through the grounds into the lake, under a rock bridge. From this station you have the dome of the temple to the right; and to the left, the mock ruins of a monastic house, well devised, built of a bright free-stone, and situated at the extremity of the lake: An elegant Gothic seat, shaded by thick groves, and open to this scene, invites the visiter to its cool recess. Below the bath there are some artificial cascades, an hermitage, confined and winding walks, and works, in the stile of the last age, placed here to give the contrast between the polished taste of the present times and the rural orna∣ments which delighted our ancestors. From thence you pass to the temple, a building in the Ionic order, erected on a round eminence at a little distance from the skirts of the plantations; the colonade is square, and the dome octagonal; in the outside niches are placed busts of Homer, Virgil, Cicero, Sappho, Theocritus, Pindar, &amp;c; the floor is 18 feet square within, inlaid with marble in Mosaic work; there are also eight busts of the philosophers, and above the door, a Pal∣las: The stucco work was done by Cartisi; and the dome painted by the Bor∣nese, father and son: The cardinal virtues and the arts painted in the squares;
<PB N="66" REF="120"/>and Pallas, surrounded by Genii, in the center: Medallions of the four seasons, in stucco work, are in the recesses between the windows. As you walk the colo∣nade, you have a view of Heighington, Shackerton, and Brusleton towers, Win∣dleston-house, Merrington town and church, Ferryhill, Mensforth, Bishop-Mid∣dleham, and the heights of Garmondsway; much of the pleasure-grounds, the Gothic seat, banqueting-house, ruin, and Sedgefield church. Returning by the bath-house, after passing the Gothic seat, you proceed by the margin of the ser∣pentine river, opened by a spacious and inclining lawn on one side, and closed on the opposite by a shrubbery and plantations, which run close upon its brink. You now advance to the banqueting-house, built in a most superb stile, in the Corinthian order; the entrance is at the back part; the chief apartment is 50 feet in length, 25 feet and a half in width, and of an equal height; the ends have bow windows, but the front windows are plain; the ceiling is elegantly painted; in an oval in the center, the assembly and banquet of the gods, by Hay∣man; to the right, in a square, Thetis's petition to Jupiter; and to the left, the cestus presented to Juno, both by Wale; above the side doors, two pieces by Hayman, the one of Cupid and Psyche, the other a procession of Bacchanals; over the fire-place is a full-length of Mr Burdon, a striking likeness; eight brackets are furnished with busts of Palladio, Vitruvius, Inigo Jones, and others; the stucco work is fine, and the mouldings richly gilt; the mantle-piece and grate are equal in ornament and beauty to the rest of the finishing: There is a small room at the side, in which is a painting of Venus on the ceiling, and Diana and Endymion over the fire-place: The designs of the several buildings were made by Payne, and executed by the late Mr Bell, of Durham. As you approach the ruin, you come to a very fine point of view, where the serpentine river makes a swift turn, takes a deep channel, covered thick with wood on each side, and forming a long canal, is crossed at the extremity by a beautiful bridge, which intercepts the further view of its course; and indeed it is so contrived, that there the water should die away from the fight. The tower of the ruin commands an extensive prospect, not only having the scene described at the colonade, to the west and north, but also a prodigious tract of country eastward: This building is orna∣mented with sculptures brought from the ruins of Guisburn priory; among them is a delicate piece of many figures, which, it is to be lamented, is exposed to the weather. In these pleasure-grounds there are 44 acres covered with water; and the whole works contain 150 acres. Mr Burdon has not yet thought proper to build a mansion-house. We cannot quit these delightful scenes without referring the reader to what Mr Walpole says in his fourth volume of 'Anecdotes;' the works here bearing every expression of that taste and art, which he speaks of with so much spirit and delight.</P>
<P>In Hatfield's Survey, we find that Roger Fulthorp and John Herdwick held the manor of Hardwick, by homage, fealty, suit of court, and 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent.

In winter, this tract is frequently overflowed, and then forms a large sheet of water; at which time, vast flocks of wild-geese, ducks, &amp;c. resort thither.—In November, 1754, an attempt was made to obtain a commission of sewers to drain these Carrs: A scheme that met with great opposition: The con∣sequence would undoubtedly have been of great advantage to the proprietors; but obviously of more detriment, by inundating every other estate down to the Tees. The land-owners afterwards cleansed out the river adjoining their respective estates, whereby every purpose of the commission was answered<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">See the Newcastle papers, 2d and 9th of November, 1754.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>To the north-west of Sedgefield lies BISHOP-MIDDLEHAM.</P>
<P>Having had such frequent occasion to mention this place in the annals of the prelates, we must beg leave to refer the reader thereto, to save a tedious repetition. This is an irregular village, built on the sides of two slopes, facing each other, with a deep hollow road between them.

<P>Osbert, sheriff of Durham, and nephew to bishop Flambard, who held the manor by the gift of his un∣cle, gave this church of Middleham to the prior and convent of Durham, in a full synod, and in the pre∣sence of bishop William de S'ta Barbara, who confirmed this donation by his charter about 1146. Mon. Ang. v. 2, p. 846.</P>
<P>Osbert's gift and William's confirmation were both set aside by succeeding bishops, as we presume; for Robt. de Insula, above a century after, gave this church to the monks of Finchale, of which he was for∣merly prior, for an augmentation of six monks; and it continued in their possession till the dissolution.

<P>In the Boldon Buke, Middleham and Cornforth are together; in which places were twenty-six villains, whose rents and services were similar to those of Boldon. There were seven cottagers, each of whom held six acres, who wrought from the feast of St Peter to Martinmas, two days in every week, and for the rest of the year one day in the week. Four bordarij held four tofts and crofts at 4 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent, and dressed four portions of land. The reeve, or headborough-man, held two ox-gangs of land in Cornforth, in right of his office: the two places paid 17 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> cornage, and provided a milch cow and a half. The punder had twelve acres, and rendered four score hens, and 400 eggs. The demesnes were in the bishop's hands.

The tenants held amongst them the lands called Foreland, or Forthland, viz. upon Pilmor 36 acres, upon Hungrecrook 2 acres, beside the Newbrig 2 acres, at the Brigg 2 acres, and 40 acres in divers places in the township field.

<P>Mr Cade, in his Letter to the Reverend Dr Kaye, published in the seventh volume of the Archaeologia, page 74, accompanied with a plate, styled <HI>The Camp at Mainsforth,</HI> says, <Q>There are several camps or stations in this county, which “undoubtedly were of Roman original; but being subsequently occupied by different tribes of adventurers, and altered according to their respective modes of defence, this circumstance has caused their primary occupancy to be over∣looked by antiquaries. I shall mention particularly those of <HI>Mainsforth</HI> and <HI>Maiden Castle</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See second volume, p. 308.</NOTE>; the former containing about sixteen acres, viz. that part now distinguished by being called the camp, though the fortifications have been of much greater extent, as appears by the vestiges repeatedly discovered, &amp;c. I can gain but little information respecting the camp at <HI>Mainsforth,</HI> which pro∣bably may derive its name from <HI>Mainfort,</HI> as being of more importance than any other in the county; I visited it about a month since; the country people called it Mount Narbon, or Narbal; it is situated about eight miles south of Old Durham, near a rivulet called the Little Skern, which has been converted into a deep fosse, and thereby rendered a place of great strength. Its present form is circular, of an extraordinary elevation, and I apprehend had been occupied, if not fabricated into its present magnitude, by <HI>Gormondus</HI> the Dane; for about three miles northwards from hence we meet with the hamlet of Garmundsway, probably named after him; and near thereto, great quantities of human bones have been discovered, both in making the roads, and in the adjacent fields. It ”is now the property of Robert Surtees, <ABBR>esq</ABBR><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr Cade adds the following note.</HI>
<P><Q>“I must beg leave to observe, that it appears to me very probable, that king Athelstan sixed his camp near Bradbury in this county, when he went against and gained that, decisive victory over the Danes in the year 937, viz. from Nun Stainton, about half a mile northwards, where we meet with some tumuli by the sides of the road, and about two miles distant from the camp at Mainsforth, from which it is separated by a very extensive morass. This situation agrees very well with the accounts that Hollingshead, Speed, and others, give us of this battle; and if we substitute what is now called Bradbury for Brimes∣bury, I believe we shall not be guilty of any capital error. The reasons that induced me to embrace this opinion are, first, we have an account of a combined army of Scots and Danes besieging the city of Du∣resme about ten years prior to this, the inhabitants being ready to revolt, only dreading the puissance of king Athelstan. Secondly, there is a large cavity on the summit of the camp at Mainsforth, which is at this day called the Danes-Hole, where there was lately dug up a pair of moose-deer horns, of an extra∣ordinary size, probably brought from Ireland by Anlaf, as they seem peculiar to that kingdom. And lastly, that this county appears to have been the great scene of action between the Saxons, Danes, and ”Normans in the tenth and eleventh centuries, from the frequent revolts that occurred, &amp;c.</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q> Speaking of the Roman ways, Mr Cade adds, <Q>The Rycknild-street originating at St David's, or Caermarthen “in Wales, and supposed by our hypothesis to be continued from Monksbridge, Derbyshire, by Little Chester, Chesterfield, and the <HI>Strata Roma</HI> at Derby, to York, and from thence by Thornton-le-street to Sockburn, Sadberge, Stainton∣le-street, Bradbury, Mainsforth, Old Durham, Chester, and Gateshead, to ”Shields and Tynemouth.</Q></P>
<P>The horn Mr Cade speaks of in the note was found about the year 1740: the draw∣ing from whence the cut was made was communicated by Mr Surtees, who says it was found by some labourers digging a pond, and not on the mount described by
<PB N="83" REF="137"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Mr Cade. The horn measures from the root B to the top A three feet eight inches; the circumference above the root D is ten inches. Large portions have been broken off the branches; particularly at one part, C, where the fracture is six inches long, and three inches wide. The remains of elephants have been discovered in several parts of this island: we may suppose the animal to which this horn belonged, or perhaps the horn only, was brought hither for show or curiosity. Our view, as well as enquiry, have equally been fruitless towards a discovery of the Roman way Mr Cade attempts to draw from Sockburn, by Mainsforth, to Gateshead; and indeed the <HI>Stainton-le-street</HI> is not well ascertained, as is noted hereafter: neither have we been more fortunate in our attempts to establish the camp which that gentleman is pleased to fix at Mainsforth; the ground has been particularly attended to, but no certain lines, or distinct characters, to support the idea of a camp here, have been made out. The name of <HI>Mount Narbon</HI> is difficult to define, and carries with it no evidence of Danish extraction. The etymology given to Mainsforth by Mr Cade, depends on the circumstance of this mount having been a fort or camp. There is adjoining to Mainsforth, towards the north-west, a very large morass, over which a road is forced, leading to the great northern turnpike road: the north-country word <HI>Forth,</HI> the Saxon foƿd; the <HI>Mainford,</HI> meaning the <HI>chief passage</HI> over the morass, may be applied to the present name of
<PB N="84" REF="138"/>the place. In the Boldon Buke, and also in some of the inquisitions, it is called <HI>Maynesford,</HI> An. 16, Hatfield, <HI>apud Maynesford.</HI> The application of <HI>Brimesbury</HI> to Bradbury, in order to bring Athelstan's camp into this place, cannot be depended on; and the old authors referred to, who mention the battle, call the place <HI>Brimesford, Brunabright, Browning field,</HI> and <HI>Brunenburg,</HI> which latter names have no similarity to that of <HI>Bradbury.</HI></P>
<P>Near to the morass, on the adjacent hill, is an old house called the <HI>Swan-house,</HI> where certain dues to the convent, and afterwards the chapter of Durham, called <HI>swan oats</HI> have been anciently received.—Had these swan oats been due to the bishop, the keeping of swans being a royal privilege, we might have determined, that in the morass there had been a <HI>keep</HI> for swans; but the prelates had no lands at Mainsforth of any great antiquity, the possessions of the See there having come by escheats and purchase, as noted in the Boldon Buke, and we do not hear of any grant to the convent of that privilege. The swan oats paid to the church were part of the <HI>seck rents</HI> for lands there, held under the convent, and now under the chapter; and in this instance we are again to lament the loss of the <HI>Melsanby book,</HI> the doomsday of the convent, wherein this species of rent would have been explained. There are the remains of a large dyke or mound, which formerly had confined the water in the morass, and caused a large <HI>reach</HI> or <HI>canal</HI> there; perhaps water fowl were here kept for the use of the convent, and the swan oats were applied for their maintenance.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Swain</HI> occurs in the ancient law books under several appellations, as <HI>Swain-mote,</HI> or Forest-court, &amp;c. the word sƿang, <HI>Country Swain,</HI> or <HI>Boklandman,</HI> holding by entry or court roll.</P>
<P>TRILLESDEN, or THRISLINDON, retains no marks of a village, one house only remaining, situated on the brink of the hill above the marshes, and opposite to Ferryhill; the mode of building, that of a superior style in the beginning of the last century. The mansion is now going to ruins. It gave a local name to its pos∣sessor before the time of bishop Hatfield. In the Boldon Buke it is said to consist of 24 oxgangs of land, each containing 15 acres, and rendering two shillings, two hens, and twenty eggs; and plowing and harrowing at Quarrington one acre, and dressing four portions of land in autumn with two men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Trillesden.</HI> In Trillesden sunt xxiiij bovatae unaqua{que} de xv acris et reddunt singulae ij bovatae v <ABBR>s.</ABBR> et ij galli∣nas et xx ova. et arant et herciant apud Querindun j acram et faciunt iiij porcationes in autumno cum ij hominibus.

<P>Having been led by connection of subject thus far westward in our route, we must return to the parish of GRINDON, which lies to the south east of Sedgefield.</P>
<P>The church of Grindon, a small edifice, stands in an open field, and requires no particular description, further, than that there is a porch therein called <HI>Fulthorp's porch,</HI> but contains nothing remarkable or curious: The Fulthorps of Fulthorp were an ancient and honourable family in this parish; Roger de Fulthorp was chief justice of the palatinate, under the appointment of bishop Hatfield, 28 Dec. 1380.

<PB N="87" REF="141"/>married should take the sirname of Fulthorp; in pursuance of which, upon her marriage with Mr Raikes of Northallerton, he assumed the name, writing himself Thomas Raikes Fulthorp.</P>
<P>The manor of Fulthorp was held of the bishop, <HI>in capite,</HI> by military service.</P>
<P>Advancing a little towards the east, you approach WINYARD, the elegant villa of John Tempest, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> one of the present worthy members for the city of Durham. The walks and pleasure grounds are new, and in the modern style; not garnished with superb ornaments, but retaining the softest features of nature, dressed with such embellishments as add to her native beauties: A fine canal stretches along the valley with an easy curvature; the borders are kept in neat order, and fringed with wood; and the whole tract opposite the house is scattered over with forest trees. Walks are judiciously laid out by the side of the canal, and in the adjacent wood, which shelter the whole from the north. Sir Hugh Capel, knight, is the first owner of Winyard that we meet with; he lived in the time of king Edward I. and by Joan his wife had five daughters, his coheiresses; Cecily, married to Richard Dalden; Laderance, married to Peter Wykes; Alfrancas, Elizabeth, and Amice: After his decease, Joan, his widow, married John the son of Peter Deuthorp, who had the wardship of two of the daughters, and procured to himself divers lands in the manor of Winyard, which he gave to Sir Henry Lisle, knight, by deed dated at Winyard, anno Domini 1283. Sir Henry Lisle, by his deed, (sans date) gave to Alan Langton, and Catherine his niece, all the lands he had or might have within the lordship or territory of Winyard. Peter Wykes, who married Laderance, (Sir Hugh's second daughter) sold his wife's part of the manor to Sir John Lisle, knight, who gave the same to Alan Langton, and Catherine his wife, who was his daughter. Roger Fulthorp, and Alice his wife, gave to Henry, the son of Alan Langton and Margery his wife, the fourth part of this manor, by their deed, dated A. D. 1316, which fourth part Roger and Alice had of Will. de Cullye. Henry de Langton, in the xi year of bishop Bury, 1344, obtained a grant of free-warren for himself and his son William in the manors of Winyard and Redmarshall, dated at Stockton the 18th day of July<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot.

<P>Matilda de Thorpe, daughter of Godefrid de Thorpe, and Roger de Stotfaldia, whom she married, had considerable possessions in this manor, in various plots in open town fields, parcel of which was granted to Stephen de Elwick about the year 1200. Stephen de Elwick, by his charter, granted and gave to God, the blessed Mary, St John the Baptist, St Goderick, and to Ralph the Prior, and the Monks of Finchale, all his lands in Thorpe, in perpetual alms, for the support of hospitality, and the maintenance of three poor persons daily, rendering yearly to John de Ketton, and his heirs, a pound of cumin, and making foreign service; witnesses Hugo de Capella, Jord. de Dauden, &amp;c. This instrument, by the names of the parties and witnesses, we may venture to place about the year 1200. Nigellus de Rungetun gave and granted to God, &amp;c. and to the aforesaid Prior and the Monks of Finchale, three oxgangs of land in the vill of Thorpe; the same witnesses as to the former grant. John de Thorpe granted to Nigellus de Runge∣ton and his heirs, or those to whom he would assign the same, one oxgang of land <HI>"in villa mea de Thorpe,"</HI> for his homage and foreign service, in proportion to half a knight's fee for six carucates of land: Hugo de Capella was witness with others to this charter. John the son of Galfrid de Thorpe gave and granted to God, &amp;c. the Prior and Monks of Finchale, two oxgangs of land in his vill of Thorpe, and also two acres beside Thornidike towards the south, and the other near Tinelaw; free from all services. Nigellus de Rungeton, by his deed, quits
<PB N="90" REF="144"/>claim to the three oxgangs before granted; John de Ketton, by his deed, quits claim to three oxgangs which Stephen de Elwick gave; John the son of Galfrid de Thorpe ratified the grant of John de Ketton; Robert de Minsterton gave and granted to God, &amp;c. and the Prior and Monks of Finchale, three oxgangs of land in Thorpe, and Robert de Thorpe confirmed the same. Galfrid the son of John de Thorpe confirmed to the monastery, all the lands they had in Thorpe, as well by the gift of John his father as of John de Ketton; John de Ketton gave and granted to God, and the same monastery, two oxgangs of land in the vill of Thorpe, with their houses and tofts. There were other grants from Walter de Shotton, Cecilia de Thorpthewles daughter and heiress of Walter de Shotton, John Warde of Thorpthewles, and Robert son of William lord of Thorpthewles, of divers other parcels of land there.</P>

<P>In 1676, at the bishop's visitation, William Speeding and Jno. Smith, church wardens, were presented —That the leads of the church were not in repair, and that books of homilies, canons, and a table of mar∣riages were wanting; the baptisms were not registered, the surplice not sufficient; and also there was a want of a chest, a book to register the names of strange preachers, and a hearse cloth; and that the church-yard was not well fenced.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>The chapelry of <HI>Wolviston,</HI> which intervenes between the lands of Grindon parish and those of Gretham, being a dependant on Billingham, will be treated of along with the mother church.</P>
<P>The town of GRETHAM stretches along the ridge of a hill, on a dry gravelly soil, and pleasant situation: the church and hospital stand to the west.</P>
<P>The church is a neat and regular building, tho' small; the chancel is six paces in width and ten in length, lighted by two windows north and south, together with the east window which consists of three lights. It is divided from the nave by a circular arch springing from hexagonal pilasters: the nave has two side
<PB N="91" REF="145"/>ailes, formed by rows of three pillars, supporting light pointed arches, two of which on the north-side have zig-zag mouldings; two pillars towards the east, in each row, are circular, the west octagonal. There are three windows on each side. The length of the nave is 14 paces, and the width, including the ailes, 13 paces. At the west end a gallery. No tower.</P>
<P>The HOSPITAL buildings were once large, and stood on a spacious green, but little of the ancient edifices remain, and it is not easy to ascertain what was their form. The master's house is a handsome new building<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Over the hall door of the mansion house the arms of Parkhurst.

From the present appearance of the chapel, it seems, from what is now standing, only to be a part of the original building, and probably was joined to the mastèr's house. The chancel is entire, but the nave much mutilated; nothing but the cross aile remain∣ing at the north-west and south-west corners at which you enter; and there is a short aile at each end, formed by two pillars supporting pointed arches. This part of the building, north and south, is twenty-two paces in length, and only seven paces in width from the chancel to the west wall: The pillars of the south aile are cir∣cular, the north octagonal: The ceiling is wood in pannels, painted. A large window of three lights in each aile; a circular arched door in the west wall, with a window above it: Under a low elliptic arch in the wall of the south aile, is a fine recumbent effigy, delicately cut in stone, dressed in a long vestment down to the feet; no insignia to suppose an ecclesiastic; the personage unknown; and under another arch, a wooden figure much defaced<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Gent.

The chancel is appro∣priated to divine service; the outer part serving as a saloon or portico, sepa∣rated by a screen and stalls, covered with heavy canopies of wood-work. There are stalls on each side of the chancel for the hospital men. The ascent to the altar is by four deep steps, passing on both sides of a large marble tomb∣stone which lies in the centre, level with the upper pavement, bearing no in∣scription; the chancel is six paces in width, from the east wall to the steps four

What confirms the idea that the original building has been mutilated, is, that the part last described could never receive the numbers which were upon the first foundation, five priests, two clerks, and forty alms-men. The present constitu∣tion only supports twelve poor men, six <HI>in</HI> and six <HI>out</HI>-brethren.

The learned Mr Pegge, in his correspondence with Mr Allan upon the subject, says, <Q>I am of your opinion, that Stephen Payn “was never master of Gretham hospital, but he was elected dean of Exeter, 1415, and continued in that post A<SUP>o</SUP>. 1419. It appears from your seal that he was the king's almoner, but the great difficulty is to know how either the king or his almoner came to be connected with this hospital; no token of this appears in your ac∣count of the hospital, nor in the recital of the king's foundations in Thomas Goodwin's history of his reign, p. 340. I can only offer a crude conjecture on this head, (viz.) that the hospital had fallen into the king's hands by some means or other, between the year 1413, when the king begun his reign, and 1419, when Payn died. As to the seal itself, the human figure no doubt represents Dean Payn, as it is evident from the habit, and the tonsure or coif. The arms at top are those which are usually given to Edward the Confessor; those on the left side are the arms of France and England, where you will observe the fleurs-de-lis are stinted to three, a mode of bearing which began in this reign; the coat on the right side I presume to be Payn's paternal arms. It is clearly the seal of the king's almoner, and of Stephen Payn as such; but then, what relation has a boat or ship to that office? Here is another difficulty, and I profess I know not how to solve it; <HI>bouche of court</HI> implies a maintenance and subsistence from thence, and <HI>bouge</HI> at the same time signifies a boat or ship: Can this be the meaning of the device? All I can say is, that our ancestors abounded with the like conceits, so I shall let it pass for a conceit, and a very foolish one. The seal, however, tho' so difficult to develope in some particulars, as stated above, is nevertheless very perfect, and ”even elegant.</Q></P>
<P>After repeating this noted antiquary's thoughts on the subject, it may appear arrogant to subjoin others; but the reader will perhaps pardon the following observations. In the year 1414, the commons, willing to comply with the king's demand of a subsidy, presented an address, praying he would possess himself of the riches of the church, and seize the clergy's revenues. It was no novel thing; the preceding reign witnessed such another proposal, and the argu∣ment which supported both was, that the great annual revenue of the church would be more beneficially employed to the public service, the amount being three hundred and twenty-two thousand marks, sufficient to maintain fifteen earls, fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred esquires, and a hundred hospitals; and the king's treasury reap yearly a surplus of twenty thousand pounds.
<PB N="104" REF="158"/>The alarm this spread among the ecclesiasties occasioned them to assemble, and the archbishop of Canterbury proposed, that to save the general wreck of the church they should approach the king with the countenance of compliance; and as a testimony of their zeal and attachment to his person and government, make a voluntary resignation of certain religious foundations where there was no cure of fouls, and therewith the alien priories. The king, willing rather to accept than extort, accepted the proposal, and parliament confirmed the act. Whether Gretham fell into the king's hands on this occasion it is impossible to determine; it is a probable conjecture that it did; and as the seal fixes to a certainty that Payn was there, it is a consequence that the hospital was in the hands of the king; as to the emblematical device of the ship or boat, it might represent the state here and on our old coins, and by the royal ensign at the stern the conjecture seems plausible.</P>

<HEAD>PARKHURST'S HOSPITAL.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1761, Dormer Parkhurst, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> then master, began to erect another hospital at Gretham for six poor women, widows or spinsters, for whom he built six neat separate dwelling-houses, with a garden-plot to each, and compleated the same in the succeeding year at his own expence; he also endowed it with lands to the annual value of thirty pounds, to be paid to such poor persons, and to supply them with coals. The women now receive two cart loads of coals and a new gown every year, and two shillings a week each. An abstract of the foundation deed is set forth in the notes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Copy Deed.
<P>This indenture, made the 12th day of October, in the year of our Lord 1762, between Dormer Parkhurst, of Hanch-hall, in the county of Stafford, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> master of the hospital of God in Gretham, in the county of Durham, of the one part, and Ralph Bradley, of Stockton, in the said county of Durham, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> John Swainston, of the same place, gent.

Now this indenture witnesseth, that for making a provision for the maintenance and support of the said alms-house, and of the persons intended to be admitted into the same, and of the carrying into execution and establishing the several charitable purposes hereinafter expressed, and in consideration of ten shillings to the said Dormer Parkhurst in hand, paid by the said Ralph Bradley, John Swainston, Wm Moor, James Hett, Joseph Dunn, Ralph Atkinson, and John Jordison, he the said Dormer Parkhurst thereby grants, bargains, sells, and confirms; and by the same deed, indented, sealed, and delivered by him in the presence of two credible witnesses, &amp;c. and which deed is intended to be inrolled in the High Court of Chan∣cery, do grant, bargain, sell, and confirm unto the said Ralph Bradley, John Swainston, &amp;c. their heirs and assigns, <HI>All those eight several closes or parcels of ground of the said Dormer Parkhurst, now or sometime hereto∣fore called by the several names of Brown's-brig-hill, Bridge-none, Elizabeth Calvert's Bigger-haugh, and Elizabeth Calvert's Lesser-haugh, containing together, by estimation, twenty-seven actes, and situate in the township of Stockton,</HI> together with, &amp;c. to hold the same unto the said trustees, their heirs and assigns, for ever, in trust, out of the yearly rents, for ever to pay and apply, for the maintenance and support of six poor women, the clear yearly sum of 4<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 16<ABBR>s.</ABBR> a-piece, by 12 monthly payments, (viz.) on the first day of every month; and also to each of them the further yearly sums of 4<ABBR>s.</ABBR> at Christmas, 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> at Easter, and 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> at Whitsuntide; and also yearly to provide and deliver to each poor women on the first day of October, a gown ready made, to be all of the same colour and decent; and further to provide for each of them, a reasonable and sufficient quantity of coals and fire fuel; and that, when any of the women are visited by sickness, and rendered incapable of taking care of themselves, a fit person, of their own sex, is to be em∣ployed by the trustees to attend them, and to be paid a satisfaction for her trouble. The said women to be nominated by Dor. Parkhurst during his life; and after, by the master of the hospital for ever. That they shall be widows, or unmarried, of the age of 50 years or upwards, and legally settled in, or belonging to the town of Gretham, and sit objects of charity; and when elected, to be admitted into the alms-house, and enjoy the provisions thereof until their deaths or deprivations. The first nomination to be on the first day of December then next. If no woman in Gretham township be fit to be elected, then to be taken from some town or place near thereto. The women to keep their persons, dress, and apartments, clean and neat, and be quiet and peaceable in their behaviour, and constantly attend divine service in the church and chapel. That Dormer Parkhurst during his life, and after his decease, the master of the hos∣pital for the time being, to have full power to make all such rules, ordinances, and constitutions, as they think proper for the government of the said women, and regulating and preserving the said charity; and to vary the same as occasion requires. If any of the women marry, or refuse to comply with the rules pre∣scribed, or otherwise misbehave themselves, to be suspended, and removed from the house, and deprived of their provision. On every vacancy, another fit person to be appointed within one month. The trus∣tees to apply the residue of the rents (after payment of the before-mentioned several yearly sums) for the improvement and reparation of the premisses; and the remainder, for placing out such poor boys, belong∣ing to the town of Gretham, apprentices to such trades as the trustees think proper: Proviso, that when such surplus shall exceed six pounds a-year, that sum only to be applied to the last-mentioned purpose; and the ultimate surplus of such rents, in the next year, to be distributed among the said six poor women, in equal shares, at four times, (viz.) January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st. The annual rents of the premisses to be paid to the trustees. When the number of trustees is reduced by death to three, the master to supply the vacancy with other fit persons, residing in or near Gretham, so as to compleat the number to seven.

The said Dormer Park∣hurst during his life, and the bishop of Durham for the time being for ever, to be the visitor of the said alms-house, and of the charity hereby established. Trustees to be only answerable for their own acts, and may reimburse themselves all expences.</P>
<P>This deed was duly executed, and afterwards inrolled in the high court of chancery, on the 23d day of November, 1762.—We are informed, that the annual rental of the above premisses is sixty pounds a-year.—Dormer Parkhurst, the founder, died in April, 1764.</P>

<HEAD>The Parish of <HI>BILLINGHAM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To the east lies the parish of BILLINGHAM.—The village of Billingham, si∣tuated on a fine eminence, commands an extensive prospect to the southward. It is a place of antiquity, and memorable for a great battle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. i. p. 46.</NOTE> fought there by Ardulf, king of Northumberland. Egfrid, bishop of Lindisfarne, gave Billingham, with divers large territories, to the church<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibm. p. 48.—Angl. Sac. v. i. p. 743.—Lel.

<P>The church of Billingham, it is said, was first built by Eanred; but there is no appearance of that distant antiquity in any part of the present structure. The chancel is five paces wide, and thirteen long: The east window consists of four lights, under a pointed arch; and there are four small windows to the fouth, and two to the north. The whole chancel is neatly wainscoted with oak; and en∣closed, from the nave, by a screen, with stalls ornamented with pierced work, under a pointed arch. The nave has two side ailes, formed by rows of four co∣lumns: Those to the south are square, with a round pilaster projecting from each angle; and support pointed arches, moulded with the zig-zag figure: The pillars to the north are heavy, and in no order of building, being of a lozenge figure, with blunted points. The arches are pointed, and without ornament: The lights are irregular: The length of the nave is twenty-two paces; and the width, in∣cluding the side ailes, thirteen paces: There is a lofty tower. The patched work in this building induces us to believe, the sacred edifice had not only suffer∣ed many and great alterations at various periods; but also, that the whole of the old church had been taken down or destroyed, not the least memorial of such an∣tiquity remaining<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><HI>Billingham Vicarage,</HI> dedicated to St Cuthbert.

<HEAD>The Parish of <HI>NORTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To the east lies the parish of NORTON.—The beautiful village of Norton is near a mile in length, extending from north to south on the easy inclination of a hill; the church standing on the highest ground, at the north end of the town. There are many good houses in this place, built in the modern stile. The climate is good, and the soil fertile. In some of the old records, we find this place called <HI>Normanton,</HI> from the old possessors, the Normans.</P>
<P>It is said, in the first vol. p. 135, from the authority of Symeon and others, that, by the pope's command, Norton was made a collegiate church, by Will. de Carilepho, for the maintenance and support of the secular canons, whom he removed out of the cathedral church of Durham. Tanner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notitia, 115.</NOTE> says, <Q>it may be “presumed that Norton was not so early, the first mention of prebends here, ”which hath yet occurred to me, being in 1227<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In Dr Hutton's collections, ex registro Gray archiepis. Ebor. It occurs again in 22 Hen. III. or 1237, in Prynn's Records, vol. 2, p. 496.

<P>In this town, lived and died the famous navigator, Mr Middleton; who was first employed to attempt the north-west passage, as it is called in maritime affairs.</P>
<P>July 20th, 1753, died, at his-house at Norton, Jeremiah Moore, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> aet. 57. He was the last of his family; and had, in the former part of his life, suffered extreme hardships, through the cruelty of his elder brother; by whose means he was carried into Turkish slavery; and at the time of his brother's death, was a common seaman in the navy, having been pressed in the Mediterranean, after he had made his escape from the Turks. When he came to his estate, he converted it into money, and settled in the north, exer∣cising acts of goodness to all his poor neighbours, to whom he left largely. Having no relations, he be∣queathed to six gentlemen, who were kind to him in his adversity, 1500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-piece; and to his housekeeper, Mrs Ann Kendal, his executrix and residuary legatee, 3000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in trust for her son.

<HEAD>NORTON CHURCH</HEAD>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Norton church, in its present state, appears to be much inferior to what it has been. The tower stands in the center, supported on four circular arches, form∣ing a square of about twelve feet. The chancel is six paces in length, and five in width. The east window consists of three lights; and there are two windows to the south, under flat or low elliptic arches. The length of the cross, from north to south, is seventeen paces; the north limb of which is called Blakiston porch, being the burial-place of the owners of Blakiston; where there is a recumbent fi∣gure in armour, cut in stone, with a rich canopy of tabernacle work over the head; the hands elevated; the legs crossed, resting on a lion; the right leg up∣wards; the sword sheathed; a shield with arms; by which we conceive it be∣longed to Thomas Blakiston, who died in the year 1484. The nave hath side ailes, formed by two round columns, not ill proportioned, with light mouldings for capitals: They support pointed arches. The nave is twenty-one paces in length, from the opening of the chancel; and in width, with the side ailes, thir∣teen paces. All the windows are flat-topped.—From this description, the reader will observe, that little of the old edifice remains, except the tower. The point∣ed arches, and flat-topped windows, were introduced in times much posterior to the heavy circular arch.—Mr Johnson, the late vicar, presented the above plate.</P>

<P>This being a manor of the bishop's, we find few instances in the records of freehold tenements: The greatest part of this district is held under church te∣nures. In bishop Hatfield's time, a resident family had assumed the local name

<P>NORTON.—Coronatores wardae de Stockton sunt collectores reddit. ep'or de Norton.</P></NOTE>, it appears there were thirty villains in Norton, each
<PB N="113" REF="167"/>holding two oxgangs of land under the like rents and services as those of Boldon, except cornage rent, which they did not pay for want of pasturage. This excep∣tion
<PB N="114" REF="168"/>confirms a curious particular, as it distinguishes, that the horn, sounding an alarm on the approach of an enemy, was not of a military nature, to call the vassals and tenants to arms, but to warn the husbandmen to drive their flocks and herds from the pastures into the strong-holds, where they had castle guard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See v. i. p. 147.</NOTE> There were twenty farmers, who held forty oxgangs of land, rendering, for every two oxgangs, half a mark: They each plowed and harrowed half an acre in the lord's demesne, provided two men two days in mowing and reaping, and the like at hay-making; also, four carts one day, or one cart four days, for leading hay and corn; and dressed four portions of land in autumn, with all their household, ex∣cept the housewife. Alan de Normanton held one carucate of land; and pro∣vided thirty-two men to work one day, and four carts one day, or two two days, to lead corn: And his men were to work, by dressing four portions of land in autumn. Adam, the son of Gilbert de Herdwick, held thirty-six acres of land in Herdwick, near Norton, then called sixty acres; and rendered two marks at the bishop's pleasure. The punder had four acres, and the thraves of Norton; and rendered fourscore hens, and five hundred eggs. Twelve cottagers held tofts and crofts, and thirteen acres in the town-fields; rendering six shillings, working fourteen days, and dressing four portions of land in autumn. North-meadows were in the bishop's hands. The whole vill provided two milch cows. —By Hatfield's Survey, it appears, that Roger de Fulthorp then held Alan de Normanton's lands, as also the lands of John de Norton, called Trumperland, in dringage. In the rents and services of the bond tenants, we see scatpennys, scat or exchequer oats, and averpennys; and that they wrought three days in every week, except a week at Easter and Pentecost, and thirteen days at Christmas: They were to fallow one day in the demesnes of Stockton, and thereby were en∣titled to a corrody. Every two villains were privileged to erect a booth at St Cuthbert's fair; and when required, the villains were, in every year, to build a house, forty feet long, and fifteen wide. Every servant to a bond tenant, of the age of sixteen years, paid yearly to the lord, towards the portions or dressing of land in autumn, twelve-pence. Selfodes, or those who subsisted independent of the lands, as self-holds, of whatever degree, dwellers in the vill, paid to the lord three-pence yearly. Those who held exchequer lands, formerly the lands of bond tenants, among other services, maintained the mill-dam and works, carried timber for the erection or repairs of the mill, found mill-stones for Norton and Stockton mills, and maintained the water-mill at Norton: They ground their
<PB N="115" REF="169"/>corn at a thirteenth mulcture. Whenever the bishop repaired or rebuilt his ma∣nor-house at Stockton, they were to carry his timber for that purpose: They also carried a dole or pipe of wine from the river Tees to the bishop's cellars, in his manor-house of Stockton.</P>

<P>BLAKISTON, the seat of Thomas Davison, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> in this parish, was a spacious old edifice, but lately pulled down.—William de Carilepho, bishop of Durham, in 1093, granted the manor of Blakiston to the prior and monks of Durham: Bishop Flambard disseising them of this possession, granted it to his nephew<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V. i. Annals of Bishop Flambard.</NOTE>; of which offence the convent complaining, as also that the prelate had wrested from them Staindrop, Staindropshire, Heworth wood, Burdon, lands in Wolveston, possessions of their church of Elvet, and the church of Siggeston, about the time of his death they brought him to contrition and public penance; and he made so∣lemn restitution thereof, in two charters, which he caused to be attested by such of his nephews as were living or present; and did not only annex his seal to the first, but also his gold ring, and signed the instrument as-a further confirmation of the restitution. It appears, that Henry I. notwithstanding his former pretend∣ed confirmation to Richard, the nephew or grandson of the bishop, did, by his charter, confirm the grant of restitution to the convent. Blakeston, soon after this transaction, was granted away by the prior and convent, to hold of them in fee, by certain services and a reserved rent. Under that grant the manor and town were anciently enjoyed by the family of Park. Geoffrey Park, knight, was living at Blakeston in the year 1264. Richard de Parco, with the assent of the prior and convent, endowed a chapel at Blakeston, granting the same to John de Blakeston, the then chaplain thereof; after which, the estate descended to Rich∣ard, the son of Richard de Parco<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1322.—Haec est finalis concordia, &amp;c. int' Ric'm de Parco &amp; Aliciam, ux. cjus quer. &amp; Johem silium Alani de Redemershill, &amp; Emmam, ux'em ejus defore. de uno messuagio &amp; novem acris terre cum p'tin. in Blakeston, &amp;c Hend. &amp;c.—<HI>Ex Orig. pen.

<HEAD>The Parish of <HI>STOCKTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To the south of Norton lies the parish of STOCKTON.—The town of Stockton, situated on the banks of the river Tees, where it makes an easy curvature, forms a crescent. The principal street, lying almost due north and south, is straight and level, near a mile in length, and one hundred and sixty yards in breadth. Many of the houses are modern and elegant. From the main street, several others
<PB N="121" REF="175"/>stretch down to the quay. The town-house, or corporation-hall, stands across the center of the main street, and obstructs the view: Had it been a terminating ob∣ject at either extremity, (as it is a handsome edifice) it would have greatly im∣proved the beauty of the place: Before it, was lately erected a pillar of the Do∣ric order, 33 feet high. There are also shambles in this street, which might well have been spared: Yet, even with these defects, Stockton is the handsomest town in the north of England.</P>
<P>It is a place of antiquity; and although a member of the wapentake of Sad∣berge, was part of the possessions of the bishops of Durham before the grant of that earldom, and claimed the attention of our prelates. There appertained to it a castle, built, as some suppose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Randal, &amp;c. &amp;c. We have seen a drawing of the castle, but believe it imaginary; perhaps the cor∣poration seal bears a resemblance of it.</NOTE>, by one of the kings of England. Bishop Pud∣sey, who was a near relation of king Stephen, was possessed of Stockton, as we find by the Boldon Buke; and probably it was held by some of the Normans, with Norton, originally the chief place of the parish; and that those manors were given soon after the conquest to the church of Durham. We find in the Boldon Buke the descriptions of <HI>"Toftum Aulae"</HI> and <HI>"contra Aulam,"</HI> which imply that the chief place of the manor had only the name of <HI>Hall</HI> at that time. Tradi∣tion says, king John was entertained here by bishop Philip, and then signed the charter of Newcastle. Bishop Farnham died here in 1257: Bishop Kellow rebuilt the palace on an improved plan, <HI>"Pulchram illam Cameram de Stockton aedificavit."</HI> Bishop Bury frequently resided here, as appears from various instruments issued from hence: Bishop Matthew lodged at Stockton in 1597, when part of the edifice was burnt; and here bishop Morton took resuge when he fled for fear of the Scots. The castle and demesnes were sold in the great rebellion of 1647 for 6165 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; soon after that it was dismantled, and the materials disposed of: The small remains are now converted into a barn, lying at the south end of the town; and the ad∣jacent grounds still bear the names of the Park, the Castle-yard, &amp;c. The manor belongs to the bishop, and the demesne lands bring him in about 600 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year.</P>
<P>Stockton is a town corporate by prescription; governed by a mayor, recorder, and six aldermen; it is also one of the four ward-towns of the county. This place is divided into two distinct constableries; one of which consists of the borough of Stockton, governed by the mayor and burgesses, who hold their borough-court with a court-leet: Within the limits, the proper officers of the borough collect the rates and duties. The manor hath a copyhold-court, a greve or bailiff, a con∣stable, and other officers, who collect distinct rates and duties within their district<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They join in raising the poor-rate; and a workhouse was lately built which cost near 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> situated in the town. The order of separation was made about the year 1677.—According to the assessment of 1740, the borough rental was 1200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which, at 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> per pound, raised 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> That of the town in houses, 1200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in lands, 2200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> The houses rated at 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> raised 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the lands at 18 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> 165 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> It was complained of that the borough had equal inhabitants and more poor, and if each constablery maintained its own poor, the town would be greatly relieved.
<P>Stockton tolls and port are leased to the corporation by the bishop of Durham for the term of twenty-one years, under the description of— <Q>All that his port, haven, and creek of Stockton, extending from the bar “or low-water mark of the sea unto the wath stead called Worsell Wath, betwixt Aislabie and Middleton ”St George, and the anchorage and plankage, and all other sum and sums of money, duties and benefits, arising, &amp;c. at the yearly rent of 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> under the benefits of which, the expences of the mayoralty are sustained.</Q></P></NOTE>.
<PB N="122" REF="176"/>Bishop Beke granted to the town of Stockton a weekly market on Wednesday, and a fair once a year on the feast of the Translation of Saint Thomas the Martyr, to continue eight whole days; <Q>saving to himself, and his successors bishops of “Durham, tolls and other rights and customs of the same, as of other markets and fairs within the liberty of Durham: Dated at Stockton the eleventh day of May, 1310, of his patriarchship the fifth, and in the twenty-seventh year of ”his consecration.</Q> It is observable we hear nothing of a body corporate or bur∣gesses in this record. Bishop Matthew, by his confirmation charter, dated the fourth of June, 1602, sets forth, that the market and fair so granted to the town of Stockton had for several years been discontinued, so that Stockton was de∣creasing in consequence before the demolition of the castle. In this charter the town and borough of Stockton are specified, and Nicholas Fletham is named as being mayor petitioning for the same: The like reservation of tolls and duties is contained therein as in the original charter. The 24th of April, 1666, bishop Cosin confirmed the preceding charters.</P>

<P>An exact survey of the manor of Stockton, and of the townepps thereunto belonging, viz. Carleton, Norton and Stockton, and Hartburne, made and taken by Edward Colston and George Daile, gentleman, 1647. But the Court of Survey was begun by Thomas Saunders, Samuel Leigh, esquire, and George Daile, gentleman, by virtue of a commission to them and us directed 18th of January, 1746, made from the honourable the trustees in the said commission named and authorised, with others, by 2 several ordinances of the High Court of Parliament, for the disposal of archbishopps and bishopps lands, throughout the whole kingdom of England and dominion of Wales. The jury enquire into severall articles, and present with the said commissioners as followeth, (viz.)</P>
<P>That the B'pp's Castle, situate at the South end of the Towne of Stockton by the river Tease, is ruinous, and in great decay; that the River is Navigable, &amp; within 10 miles of the Mayne Sea.—That the towne of Stockton is an antient Burrough &amp; Markett towne by antient Charters, but the Markett unserv'd of late, it standing very dirty in winter, formerly a fair for 8 days.</P>
<P>That the Country is a Champion Country, very fruitful, though a stiff Clay.</P>
<P>That the Castle hath had a great moate ab<SUP>t</SUP>. it, but the same is now for want of cleansing silled up in part, &amp; within that moate hath heretofore been orchards &amp; gardens, but all destroyed; there hath likewise been a Parke, but the same hath been disparked.</P>
<P>That there belongeth to the said Castle good demesnes worth per ann. as it is now lett, 218 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> viz. a meadow or parke lying under the Castle Wall, containing 26 acres, now lett for 19 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 0 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—The Thornes, with the Intack &amp; horse close, containing about thirty acres, &amp; the other ground ab<SUP>t</SUP>. 20 acres, lett for 30 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—The Park heads 45 acres, Little meadow field 40 acres, lett for 41 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—The great Sumer field 130 acres, and Winter field. lett for 82 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 18 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 7 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—Kelsoe Hill 40 acres, and Midnight Hole 40 acres, letten for 41 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—Smithy Hill &amp; orchard, lying under the Castle Wall, is now lett for 00 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 0 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—All which amounts together to 218 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 1 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—And by the testimony of several upon oath the same is worth 280 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 0 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 0 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—That there is no wood growing upon any part of it, or in that part of y<SUP>e</SUP> Country; nor is there any Quarryes, Mynes, Parks, or Sheep Racks within the said Moate, ex∣cept the Park above mentioned belonging to the B'pp.</P>
<P>That the B'pp has the royalties of the River of Tease, as Whales, Sturgeon, Porpoises or the like, taken on that side the River next the County of Durham within his mannor of Stockton, &amp; all wracks of the sea, but know not what they are worth:—not 5 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann.</P>
<P>That there is one Water Corne Milne called Norton Milne, w<SUP>c</SUP>h we are informed the Ten<SUP>t</SUP>s. of the severall Townepps within the said mann'<SUP>r</SUP>. (save only Carleton) are tyed to grind all their Corne at; &amp; that there belongeth to the said Milne 6 acres of meadow, the hay of which belongeth to the Ten<SUP>t</SUP> of y<SUP>e</SUP>. s<SUP>d</SUP>. Milne, but the herbage thereof after the hay taken off belongeth to the Inh'itants of the Townepp of Norton, which s<SUP>d</SUP>. Milne is lett by Lease unto Alice Armstrong for 3 Lives.—And the Copyholders within the s<SUP>d</SUP>. severall Townshipps by the Custome of the s<SUP>d</SUP>. mann'<SUP>r</SUP>. are to repaire the s<SUP>d</SUP>. Milne with Thatch &amp; Wall, &amp; to scour the Race &amp; Dame, when need requireth; &amp; to fetch such timber from time to time from Clake wood near Osmotherley or elsewhere, within 12 miles distance from the said Milne, as also the Milstones for the use of the s<SUP>d</SUP>. Milne from Raley-Green or Walker field, for which their service every draught is to have 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> per mile, &amp; their Men's Dinners paid by the tenant: other Milnes we knowe of none within the s<SUP>d</SUP>. mann. belonging to the B'pp.</P>
<P>That the sev'rall Ten<SUP>t</SUP>s. of the afores<SUP>d</SUP>. Townepps (viz.) Copyholders, are to do suite and service to the Lords Courts, &amp; to carry his provision or household stuffe to Durham or B'pp Auckland from Stockton Castle, (viz.) at 1 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> per Bushell for Corne, and 4 <ABBR>d</ABBR> per mile for every Draught, &amp; meat &amp; drinke for men and Cattle:—Wee dont know of any releif or heriott ever paid unto any B'pp after the death of any tenant.</P>

There were also six who held nine oxgangs of land in farm, performed their services, and paid as those of Norton. Adam, the son of Walter, held one carucate and one oxgang of land, rendering a mark in silver. Will. de Tumba held four oxgangs for half a mark,
<PB N="123" REF="177"/>and one oxgang by favour of the bishop, and was free from work whilst he con∣tinued in the bishop's service, but when out of that service, was to work in pro∣portion to half a carucate of Walter's lands.

Walter Webster held one burgage, and did suit for the same at the borough-court from three weeks to three weeks; and was free of toll within the liberty of Durham, except in Sadberge wapentake, rendering at four terms vj <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Will. Osborn had two burgages; Thomas Fowler, and twenty-eight others, held 19 burgages and 17 half burgages, under the like rent and services.

After them the free tenants are named, some of whom performed foreign service, and others repaired the mill∣dam and le Fleme of Norton mill.

Robert Dykon, a cottager, made four portions in autumn, and carried the hens and eggs rendered by the tenants to the bishop's dwelling-place, where-ever it occasionally might be, between Tyne and Tees. The bond∣tenants held each a messuage and two oxgangs of land, each oxgang consisting of 15 acres; they paid 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> each for scatpennys, and six bushels of scat oats; 16 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>

<P>—Tho. Rudd, clerk, 1663, at 20 marks a year, was son of Tho. Rudd of Sandford, in Westmorland, and curate of Stockton, under Dr Allan Smallwood, vicar of Norton, as his reader about ten months.</P></NOTE>, in which there was also a free chantry,
<PB N="129" REF="183"/>dedicated to the Virgin Mary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>E. MSS. Rudd.</HI>—In bishop Hatfield's Survey it is stated, "There are four oxgangs and one mess. for∣merly Robert Combe's, which yearly used to pay 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> at present nothing, being in mortmain for a chan∣try there, which is possessed by a chaplain to perform divine service: Also a certain old toft, formerly Rob.

Will Bainbridge, a little before the dissolution, likewise gave one third of an oxgang for burning two wax lights to St Thomas Becket on the 7th July every year, being the festival of his Translation. The two last chaplains were Tho Salvin and Blanch Crofton. <HI>E. MSS. Tho. Rudd. — Randal's MSS.</HI></NOTE>. Mr Rudd, in his MS. notes, says, <Q>At this “time (speaking of the time of his becoming curate), there was not a brick house in Stockton, and but about 120 dwelling-houses and families. The next year (1663), Mr Thomas Davison being collated to Norton, and desirous to gratify the inhabitants of Stockton with a preacher, Mr Rudd gave up his school, and applied himself to preaching, for which he had an annual salary of 26 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the surplus fees, and so he continued till 2d February, 1689, when Mr Davison was turned out for refusing to swear allegiance to Wm and Mary. Mr Rudd was made vicar in his place; yet was he so kind to his old worthy master, as that he freely permitted him to continue in the vicarage house, and enjoy all the profits as formerly, he finding a curate, and only reserving for himself the pro∣fits ”of the chapelry of Stockton<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In 1712, Mr Rudd was instituted to Long Newton, after he had ministred at Stockton 49 years and three months.—<HI>See Longnewton.</HI></NOTE>.</Q> Stockton chapel being by length of time ruinous, and much too little, and the inhabitants growing every day more nu∣merous, the building of a new church became necessary. A brief was read for the purpose of obtaining contributions, 21st May, 1710; and on the 5th of June following, the foundation stone was laid of an elegant new church, built of brick, embellished with free-stone, with a tower: It is regularly stalled with oak, has a good organ, and a ring of six musical bells. This edifice was consecrated by bishop Crewe, 21st August, 1712. In the 12th year of queen Anne, 1711, an act of Parliament was obtained to make Stockton, with East Hartburne and Preston, a distinct and separate parish from Norton. The act states, that Stock∣ton is an ancient corporation and borough, and by reason of its situation upon a navigable river not far from the sea, becoming a place of good trade and com∣merce, and very populous, instead of a ruinous chapel, the inhabitants had built a beautiful new church upon a parcel of the waste of the manor, near to the place where the ancient chapel stood, &amp;c. It was thereby enacted, that there should be a vicar to have the care of souls of the inhabitants of such parish of Stockton, and a perpetual succession of vicars there, to have capacity and succession by the name of the vicar of the parish church of Stockton upon Tees, and be enabled to sue and be sued in that name in all courts and places of this realm, and should have and enjoy all tithes, offerings, oblations, obventions, mortuaries, and other eccle∣siastical benefits. That the patronage of the vicarage should belong to the bishops of Durham, and that they exercise all ecclesiastical jurisdiction within that parish, and that the inhabitants be subject to the customs and usages for the choice of church-wardens, overseers of the poor, surveyors of the highways, constables, and
<PB N="130" REF="184"/>other like parish-officers, as they had theretofore been. That there should be twelve vestry-men to be chosen, and have succession as therein directed, for the better raising and ascertaining future taxes, assessments, and contributions, for dis∣charging debts contracted about building the church, buying bells, keeping the same in repair, and defraying the yearly expences of church-wardens, and paying 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the inhabitants of Norton in discharge of all contributions towards Norton church, all cesses and taxes to the parish of Norton, as for expences touching the obtaining the said act. Then follow the rules for choosing the first vestry-men, to continue in office for the term of three years, with the method of electing successors in case of death, and at the end of every three years a new set of vestry-men. And the act directs, that the minister, church-wardens, and vestry-men assembled, or the major part of them, should make by-laws, rules, orders, and directions for the good of the parish and better government thereof, the same to be ratified and confirmed by two justices of the peace for the county; and should from time to time rate, tax, and assess all lands, tenements, houses, and personal estate in the said parish, as the major part of them should think just and reasonable, towards dis∣charging the matters before noted, for building a vestry-room, and making other improvements about the church, and keeping the same in repair; and for raising a yearly sum, not exceeding 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to be paid to the vicar for the time being, as an augmentation of his income; to be collected by the church-wardens; and, if need requires, to be levied by distress and sale, by warrant from two justices, with right of appeal to the quarter sessions by persons aggrieved, where the same should be finally determined, and costs awarded. The lord bishop was thereby im∣powered to grant to the vicar, without any fine, a parcel of waste ground near the alms-house, of the yearly value of 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> or thereabouts, and any other waste ground in the manor, not exceeding the yearly value of 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> And it was thereby also enac∣ted, that the vicar should hold the parcel of waste ground adjoining to the church-yard on the east side thereof, the same being intended for a place for a house to be built upon for the vicar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Chandler, by will, lest a sum of money to purchase a house for the vicar, to which the trustees under bishop Crewe's will gave 50 <ABBR>l</ABBR> in June, 1750.</NOTE>. And the vicar was thereby impowered to take lands, not exceeding 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, over and above the lands and provisions before stared; and was directed to bear and pay a third part of first-fruits, tenths, procurations, and synodals for the parish of Norton. In the first year of Geo. l. 1714, an act was obtained to explain and make more effectual the act of queen Anne, whereby the vicar for the time being was invested with power to demise the waste grounds granted as before-mentioned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stockton Vicarage.</HI>—Dedicated to St Thomas.

<P>In Mr Rudd's time, and by his pious endeavours, an alms-house or hospital was erected, and a fund raised for the support of — poor people. The principal benefactors thereto were, Mrs Margaret Bailey, from whom the Raisbecks are
<PB N="132" REF="186"/>descended; Mr John Slope, Mr Matth. Waggoner, and Mr Alderman James Cook, who finished the building, and left thereto at his death 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in aug∣mentation of the fund.</P>
<P>In 1721, a charity school for twenty boys was instituted by voluntary contribu∣tions, and in 1759 sixteen girls were added; and the fund is now so much in∣creased, as at this time to support a master, a mistress, twenty boys, and sixteen girls; who are all cloathed, taught to read, write, and cast up accounts; and are taken in at the age of seven, and continued to the age of fourteen years. In 1729, certain lands called Lustram and Elwick Mire, in the township of Stockton, were purchased for the purposes of this charity for 670 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; and in 1767, six copy∣hold closes near the town of Stockton were purchased for 16<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5 <ABBR>l</ABBR>—The master's salary was originally 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, and 12 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year was added when the go∣verness for the girls was first appointed, out of which the master was to pay her stipend.</P>
<PB N="133" REF="187"/>
<P>The trade and importance of Stockton rapidly increasing; in order to render the approach more commodious from Cleveland, in the year 17<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> an act of parlia∣ment was obtained for building a toll-bridge across the river, a little below the old ferry-boat landing; a compensation is made to the bishop and his lessee for the loss of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erry. The bridge, which is an elegant structure, was finished in April 1771, and consists of five arches; the span of the center arch is 72 feet, the two next 60 feet; and the two end arches 44 feet each; the width of the bridge between the walls is 18 feet; the whole erection, with the road at the ends, cost 8000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>; raised by subscription, and made, by virtue of the act, a funded debt, entitled to all the benefits of increased profits.</P>
<PB N="134" REF="188"/>
<P>In 1660, the whole town did not contain above 120 families.—In 1666, there were in the town and borough only 136 families, poor and rich.—In 1692, there were 350 families besides the poor, so that in 26 years there was an increase of 214 families; and 1725, there was 430 besides the poor, which at least were 100 more. And by an accurate calculation, made in the year 1780, the town con∣tained 1040 families; and in 1781, there stood in the collector's books 478 houses, which paid window duty, exclusive of empty houses and those not charged. The inhabitants of all denominations are now supposed to be about 4000.</P>
<P>For the reasons before assigned, we find few free tenants named in the records, and those for small parcels of land. Tho. de Stafford died seised of two oxgangs of land and three acres of meadow in the vill of Stockton, in the fifth year of bishop Bury, held by homage and fealty. In the fifth year of bishop Hatfield, Will. the son of Thomas de Stockton, died seised of two messuages and three oxgangs of land there, and also two messuages and two oxgangs of land in Herdewyk near Norton, held of the bishop <HI>in capite,</HI> by homage and fealty. In the 13th of bishop Skirlaw, Will. Osberne died seised of 30 acres in Stockton, held by military service and suit of court.

<P>The trade of Stockton chiefly consists of lead, corn, butter, bacon, and cheese for foreign markets; and raff or timber is a chief import. There is a manufac∣tory of sail-cloth and cordage, with other materials for shipping. Several vessels of large burthen are built here, capable of carrying 20 guns<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We were desirous of shewing the importance of this maritime county, by tables of the exports and imports; but however unaccountable it may be, it is true, that the communication of such tables was pro∣hibited by the board of customs.—So illiberal an act gives abundant latitude to conjecture; and, perhaps, the reform which is set on foot under the present administration, may take away the necessity of secrecy. Be the cause what it may, the importance of our county in its trading capacity is shadowed from the eye of the curious.—The author met with a like prohibition in his enquiries touching the exports and imports of Cumberland.</NOTE> There was of late a considerable sugar-house in Stockton. The trading vessels of chief burthen come up no higher than Porterack, about a mile below the rown; the river from that place making a large bend, the shoals and shifting sands render the navi∣gation troublesome.</P>

There were three cottagers who wrought 14 days in the autumn, and the whole vill provided one milch cow. Ten carucates of the demesne lands of Stockton and Herteburn were in firm, and the rent was 20 charders of corn. In bishop Hatfield's Survey, John Lakan is the only free tenant named, who held by foreign service.

The Parish of <HI>EGGLESCLIFF.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Pursuing the course of the river Tees, to the south lies the parish of EGGLES∣CLIFF. The church and village stand on an elevated point of land, over-looking the town of Yarm, in Yorkshire, and commanding a view of the river, where it forms the figure of an S (crossed by a bridge of five arches), and washes a rich and beautiful country: This prospect is enlivened by the passage of barges and craft on the river. The Yorkshire shore is formed into quays, with granaries and store-houses.</P>
<P>The church is an irregular building. The chancel is five paces in width, and in length to the altar rails three paces, and from thence six paces to the nave. The east window consists of five lights under a pointed arch; there are two windows to the south, and one to the north; the chancel is wainscotted round the altar, and is stalled at the sides and at the entrance. The nave is separated by a pointed arch; is seven paces wide and sixteen paces long: On the south side, a porch projects from the main building, opening to the nave by one octagonal pillar supporting pointed arches, called Pemberton's porch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For pedigree, see following page.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>The manors of Egglescliff and Aslakby were jointly the possessions of the ancient family of Aslakby. In 1343<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot. Bury, Sch. 14, Ao. 10.</NOTE>, Henry de Aslakby obtained licence to settle those manors on John the son of William de Aslakby, knight, for life; and after his death, on William his son for life; and after his death, to John his son, and Alice the daughter of Henry, and the heirs of their bodies lawfully issuing; and in default of such issue, to Henry's right heirs for ever. In the 12th year of bishop Skirlaw, Alicia, the wife of John de Norton, died seised of an estate for life in the said manors, by the grant of John the son of Will. de Aslakby, knight, with reversion reserved to John and his heirs; and remainder to Thomas the son of William, and Agnes his wife, and the heirs of their bodies; and in default of such issue, remainder to John's right heirs for ever. The manor of Fgglescliff was then held of the bishop <HI>in capite,</HI> by fealty and half a knight's fee, and suit at the wapentake of Sadberge; and the manor of Aslakby was held by fealty and sixty shillings each, and the service of keeping a fourth part of the gaol of Sadberge<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

<P>In this parish we find distinctly named in the records Middleton St George and Nether Middleton, or Middleton One Row. In the time of bishop Bury, the family of Bart was possessed of the manor of Middleton St George. Whilst the See was vacant in the year 1345, Rowland Bart claimed a moiety of the manor as son and heir of Ralph his father, who held the same under bishop Beaumont, on which a writ <HI>de etate probanda</HI> issued in the name of the king, by the hands of
<PB N="142" REF="198"/>John de Marton, chancellor, dated the 15th of May; and an inquisition was

<P>Still proceeding by the river Tees, we enter the parish of DINSDALE, passing the house of Reed Ward, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> on an elevated and beautiful situation on the banks of the river, commanding a fine rural prospect.</P>
<P>Dinsdale lies in a deep retirement, within a little distance of the river. The church is a mean edifice; the chancel, ten paces in length and five in width, is lighted by a window of three divisions, under a pointed arch to the east: The nave measures ten paces from the chancel to the west end, and is in width twelve
<PB N="144" REF="200"/>paces, including the porch on the south side, which is formed by an octagonal pillar supporting pointed arches. In this porch lies a stone, sculptured with a large crosier staff, the head radiated, and each point finished like a barbed arrow; it appears to cover a vault. In the north-west corner of the nave, there is another stone in the pavement sculptured in the same manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dinsdale, alias Dittinsdale, rectory.—Dedicated to St John.

He left four daughters his coheiresses, by whom the lordships of Dinsdale and Middleton One Row, with the mansion-house at Dinsdale, and a salmon fishery in the river Tees, were sold to John Lambton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of Lamb∣ton Hall, in the year 1770, for 15,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>It has been observed to us, that <Q>the bishops of Durham formerly came down “by Upper Dinsdale, where are the remains of an intrenchment or mote of some old habitation (in which place Mr Ward found several antiquities), crossed the Tees over a wooden bridge there, the foundations of the piers of which are still visible, and so to Middleton, where there are intrenchments or some works of ”defence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the notes of Mr Robert Culley, late of Denton, deceased.
<P>[☞ Mr Francis Place, of Dinsdale, a younger son of Mr Rowland Place of the same place, was put clerk to an attorney in London, where he continued till 1665; in which year, going accidentally into a shop, the officers came to shut up the house, on its having the plague in it. This occasioned his leaving London, and gave him an opportunity of quitting a profession that was contrary to his inclination, and of following the roving life he loved, and the arts for which he had talents. He painted, designed, and etched. Ver∣tue had heard that he had learned the latter of Hollar, and has preserved a letter that he received from Mr Place in answer to his enquiries into that fact, and about Hollar himself, of whom he relates to his own knowledge many particulars which Vertue had inserted in his life of that artist, but denies his having been instructed by him. Ra. Thoresby, in his Ducatus Leodiensis, often mentions Mr Place with great encomi∣ums, and specifies various presents that he made to his museum. He tells us too, that Mr place discovered an earth for, and a method of making porcelain, which he put in practice at the mansion-house of York, of which manufacture he gave Thoresby a fine mug. (This pottery cost him much money: He attempted it solely from a turn to experiment, but one Clifton, of Pontefract, took the hint from him, and made a fortune by it.) From the same account we learn, that Mr Place discovered porphyry at Mount Sorril, in Leicestershire, of which he had a piece to grind colours on. This author specifies views of Tinmouth castle and light-house, the cathedral of York, churches and prospects of Leeds, drawn and etched; and a mezzotinto of Henry Gyles the glass painter, executed by Mr Place. He also<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scraped three plates of John Moyser, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of Beverley, his particular friend; of Thomas Comber, dean of Durham; and of bishop Crewe; the last is finely executed. Many sketches of castles and views which he took in Wales, and of va∣rious other places in England, Scotland, and Ireland, several of them well finished, are extant, and have been engraved: A view of Scarborough castle was drawn as late as the year 1715. His prints are very scarce; he seldom resided in London, and drew only for his amusement, seldom compleating what he undertook; and in his rambles painting, drawing, and engraving occasionally. In the reign of Cha. II. he was offered a pension of 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year to draw the royal navy, but declined accepting it, as he could not endure confinement or dependance. In Thoresby's Topography of Leeds are some churches drawn by Place, also several views in Drake's Eboracum. Ames mentions a print by him, which I have, of Rich. Thompson, from a painting of Zoust; it is boldly done; Another is of Sterne, archbishop of York. He did some plates of birds, viz. seven from the drawings of Barlow, and the figures for Godartius's book of infects. He scraped a sine mezzotinto of his friend and relation Philip Woolrich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Place was capital in drawing portraits in crayons; Mr Allan has the original drawing of Mr Woolrich, and also the mezzotinto print scraped from it, together with that of Charles the First, a piece of the Gooseberties, and many other of his crayon drawings.

<HEAD>The Parish of <HI>SOCKBURN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Still pursuing the course of the river Tees, we enter the parish of SOCKBURN, which comprehends only the manor of that name. Leland's description of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Itin. v. 1, p. 77.</NOTE> carries a competent idea of the place: <Q>Sokburne where as the eldest house is of “the Coniers, with the demains about it, of a mile cumpace of exceding pleasaunt ”ground, is almost made an isle, as Tese ryver windeth about it.</Q> The opposite lands on the Yorkshire shore rise swiftly from the river, and form a beau∣tiful amphitheatre. In Lambarde's Dict, p. 324, it is thus mentioned, <Q>Soct∣burgh “in Chron. Lindisf. after that Aldunus and his wandringe mates had reposed the reliques of their great patron Cuthbert, and buylded somwhat at Durham, then begged hard, not for cantels of chese as other poore men doe, but for large corners of good countries, as al their profession used, and obteyned of k. Canute the manor of Standrop. Then also moved they noble and gen∣tlemen by the example of their kinge to doe somwhat, accordinge to their pro∣portion; and as every man was more dolt (decent I should have said) then his fellow, so obteyned they more at his handes. Amongst others one Snaculf, the son of Cykell, gave them Soctburgh, Morton, and others. Soctburgh was of some estimation before that the See came to Durham; for while it was in the Holy Isle, Higbald was consecrated byshop at Sockbyry, after the death of Cyne∣wulfe." Leland observes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Itin. v. 1, fol. 47.</NOTE>, "the house and land of Sokburn hath bene of auncient tyme the very inheritance of the Coniers, whos name (as I Iernyd of ”himself) is in auncient writings Congrues and not Coniers.</Q> It is probable the manor of Sockburn was granted out early to one of the Coniers's for some valiant action, as the following ceremony denotes, which is performed at this day on the bishop of Durham's first entrance into the county<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vid.

In the ancient pedigree of the family of Coniers it is set forth, that <Q>Sir John Con∣yers, “knt. who slew the monst'rous, venemous, and poysonous wyveron, ask, or worm, which overthrew and devoured many people in fight, and the scent of the poyson was so strong that no person might abide it, and hee by p'vidence of Almighty God overthrew it, and lyeth buried at Sockburne before the conquest. But before he did enterprise, having but one childe, went to the church in com∣plete armour, and offered up his sonne to the Holy Ghost, which monuments ”are yet to see. Also the place where the serpent lay is called Greystone.</Q> How far the reader will give credit to this relation is not enquired of, but certain it is the family was settled here about the time of the conquest, and were barons of the palatinate, for Roger Coniers then held the same, and was by the conqueror made constable of Durham castle, and keeper of all the soldiers arms therein; and which office was settled on him and his heirs male for ever, by grant under the great seal of Wm de Carilepho, bishop of Durham. They continued to hold the manor till issue male failing in Sir John Conyers, his daughter and heiress Anne married Francis Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, whose daughter and heiress married Stoner of Stoner, in the county of Oxford, who sold Sockburn, with the manor of Bishop∣ton, to Sir Edward Blacket, in whose family those possessions still continue. Cuth∣bert, the second son of the last Sir John Conyers, purchased Horden, where the family have been seated for several descents, and from whom the present baronet is descended. Bishop Bury granted free warren to Sir John Coigniers in his lands at Sockburn, Bishopton, Harperley, Le Blackhall, and Stainton<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rot. 9. Curs. Rolls.

The nave is lighted to the south by three windows under round arches. The tower is low: On the west front are three shields of arms, the dexter Nevill's, the centre Tailbois's, and the sinister Dacre's.

Towards the left you have Walworth, Heighington, Blackwell-Grange, and Halnaby, with a long extended view over the Yorkshire banks of Tees, on which are scattered various farmholds, Melsonby, Mansfield, and Coniscliff churches, and several other principal objects: To the right, the town of Darlington inclining to the morning sun, with a full pro∣spect of the church: Egleston hills to the north-west, and an extensive stretch upon the vale of Tees, terminated by the Cumberland and Westmoreland mountains, of Middle and Cross Fell, mixing with the azure of the horizon, not less than thirty miles upon a line: The front ground contains the village of Neseham, with a fine canal formed by the river, the banks of which are highly cultivated.</P>
<P>In this place lived and died that great and self-taught mathematician Wm Em∣erson, whose name and writings are so well known to the public. His person was robust, rough, and masculine; his dress slovenly and mean; his manners studiously vulgar and abrupt; his way of life as singular as his person, frequently descending to the meanest labour and occupations; ale was his favourite liquor, and his diet was low, though he had a fortune sufficient to procure him all the comforts of life. Amidst these singularities he was acknowledged to be the first genius of the age in mathematics, in which line he was communicative and liberal; and though he would assume an air of negligence touching his abilities, as if not conscious of them, he had infinite pride therein. He affected an appearance of infidelity in religious matters (the folly of many mathematicians), and was an example to the vulgar not a little reprehensible. He was a great contributor to the Ladies Diary under the signature of MERONES, and for many years unknown, till a transposition of letters discovered his name. Dr Cloudsley, of Darlington, has a fine portrait of him in crayons, for which he sat to Mr Sykes, and is a most striking likeness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beneath the shelter of the silent Elm,

<P>Having pursued the channel of the river Tees thus far, we must call the reader's attention back to the western boundary of Norton parish, where it adjoins to the parish of Redmarshall, which must next be teated of.</P>
<P>Anthony Beke, bishop of Durham, gave to his brother John Beke, baron of Eresby in Lincolnshire, the manor of Redmarshall, who sold the same to Thomas Moulton; and he sold it to Sir Henry Lisle, knt. lord of the manor of Wynyard, who gave the manor of Redmarshall to Catharine his niece, wife of Alanc of Langton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Winyard.</NOTE>, burgess of Berwick and Newcastle, and to the heirs of the body of the said Catharine for ever, as appears by his deed bearing date A. D. 1306. Walter Bec, by his charter, granted to Ade Carpentio de Derlington, for his homage and foreign service, four oxgangs of land in the vill of Redmershil, <HI>de dominico cjusdem ville:</HI> This instrument, in the collection of the late Tho. Gyll, is without date, so that it is not easy to reconcile it with the foregoing disposition of the manor. In the sixth year of bishop Bury, Ralph de Rungeton held lands here of Henry de Langton<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. Ra.</NOTE> by fealty. John Gunneson died seised of certain messuages held of the same Henry in the fifth year of bishop Hatfield; and we find various other proprietors of small parcels, among whom are the Nevills.

<P>CARLETON, in bishop Flambard's time, with Burdon and Aycliff, were restored. to the See by royal charter made in the great council of the state, the same having been injuriously claimed and retained by the people of Northumberland. In the Boldon Buke it is noted, there were twenty-three farmers in Carleton who held forty-six oxgangs of land, rendering for every two oxgangs x <ABBR>s.</ABBR> and providing a carriage for leading hay or corn six days, and making sour portions in autumn with all the household except the house wife, and paying two hens and twenty eggs. Gerbrode held four oxgangs, paying 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> whilst in the service of the bishop he was exempt from work, but otherwise was liable at the will of the lord to perform the same with other farmers there. Helias held two oxgangs at xx <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent; Walter the miller two oxgangs, paying ten shillings de firm. and 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for work. Suminia, the widow, held two oxgangs for life, clear of rents and services, which after her death reverted to the lord. William, the son of Orm, held one carucate of land, paying ten shillings, and attending the great chace
<PB N="160" REF="218"/>with one greyhound. For the mill was rendered xx skeps of corn of Jarrow mea∣sure; what the quantity was is not to be recovered. In bishop Hatfield's Survey the tenures are set forth as follows: Dringage land, Will. the son of John de Red∣mershill, and Simon de Camera, each held four oxgangs of land containing sixty acres, attending, as their only service, the great chace with their greyhounds. The free-tenants were only three, viz. Thomas, son of John Gower, Hugh de Laton de Thorp, and Tho. de Cramblyngton, who each held a rood of meadow only. The firmarij were twenty in number, and performed similar services to those mentioned in Boldon Buke, with the addition of carrying timber for Carl∣ton mill, and providing mill-stones; and when the lord rebuilds or repairs the manor-house of Stockton, they should assist in carrying timber, and should also repair the mill there. The tenants had the common bakehouse at 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent, the mill 6 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and malt 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> The exchequer lands were very small. Tho.

<P>Chr.

The chancel is four paces in width and seven in length, lighted to the east by a window of three parts under a circular arch, and one window to the south; it is separated from the nave by a heavy circular arch. In the south wall near the altar is an arched recess, but no effigy or inscription. The nave is fifteen paces in length and six in width. There is a porch to the south called Claxton's Porch, containing a large window that gives light to the whole nave. On an altar tomb are two elegant figures in alabaster of a man and his wife, recumbent, supposed to be of the Claxton family; the hands are elevated; the legs are extended, resting the feet on some animal, but so mutilated and bedaubed with wash as not to be distin∣guised whether a dog or a lion. As the heiress of the Horden family of Conyers
<PB N="162" REF="220"/>intermarried with Claxton, and carried with her the large possessions, as well of the Conyers as Langtons, ancient lords of Redmarshall, and from the name of the porch where the tomb stands, it is probable the persons represented were Clax∣tons. The tower of the church is so much disproportioned to the size of the edifice, and so dissimilar in its construction, that it carries evidence of its being originally built as a place of defence: Yet in 1462, Adam Morland, then rector, fortified the rectory-house; the tower of which, with embrasures, remains to this time.</P>

<HEAD>The Parish of <HI>BISHOPTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Proceeding westward, the next adjoining parish is BISHOPTON. In Lambarde's Dictionary, and the Chronicle of Lindisfarne, Bishopton is thus mentioned, <Q>“Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>copton a village in the bishoprike of Durham wheare one Roger Conyers a nobleman of that countrie, in tyme of kinge Stephen resistid one William Cumyn an ambitious prelate, which sought by forcible and warlike meanes to invade the sea, and to have compelled the monkes of Durham to have elected him after Gaufride (which died about the yeare 1136) their byshop, which bycause they refused to do, he beseiged, sacked &amp; spoiled not only th' abbey, but the towne of Durham also, withe suche crueltie &amp; exquisite tor∣mortes of deathe against suche as resisted him, as scarsely is the like to be found eyther in the Scottes or Danes themselves, which have after a most barbarous sort often tymes heryed that quarter, howbeit, in th' end, he bothe lost his de∣syre &amp; was compelled by the nobilitie of the country (armed for that purpose) to submitte himselfe to the lawfully elect, whose name was William also; what∣soever ”the cause was it is named of the byshop.</Q> The reader will revert to the first vol. p. 161, for a full account of Cumyn's procedure. The seat of Roger Coniers (a person of great power in the twelfth century), was at Bishopton, a fine elevated situation, and in a plentiful corn country; but what is most remarkable is, that though the village stands on high ground inclining to the south-east, and the church is built on an eminence in the center, where the ground, strong by nature, was easily fortified; yet the place chosen for the strong-hold where Coniers defended himself against the troops of the usurper of the See, is a flat a little distance east of the village, and overlooked by the whole adjacent eminence: This situation could be chosen for no other apparent natural cause, than that water could be obtained there to sill the trenches. The plain is very narrow, but the whole ground marshy. To give the reader some idea of the mode of fortification in those days, the following sketch exhibits a design or ground plot of this impregnable fortress, and we have also given a view of the elevation. The crown of the mount
<PB N="163" REF="221"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> is almost level; from north to south ten paces wide, and sixteen paces from east to west; the circumference of the mount at the foot, as proved in the first ditch, is two hundred paces: To the north the ground is marshy, and capable of supply∣ing the trenches with water, they being nearly level with each other; to the south the ground rises gently: The village of Bishopton is to the west. The elevation of
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> the mount is about sixty perpendicular feet; the prospect from the summit is con∣fined, save only to the north-east: The crown of the hill hath no marks of build∣ings, so that the few people that could be placed thereon, notwithstanding such breast-works as they had, would not be secure. Perhaps this was a dernier resort; yet troops driven within the breast-works and circunvallations might be annoyed by the engines of an enemy; and even a strong bow would carry an arrow with force from the plain without the ditches to the summit.</P>
<PB N="164" REF="222"/>
<P>The manor of Bishopton was the possession of the family of Conyers of Sock∣burn, and held therewith <HI>in capite</HI> by the service of one knight's fee and suit of court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V. Sockburn.</NOTE></P>
<P>The church of Bishopton, with that of Sockburn, were given by Roger Conyers, with the consent of Robert his son and heir, to Sherburn hospital soon after its foundation; which bishop Pudsey confirmed, only reserving to himself the power of ordaining proper vicars therein. <HI>Quod procurator infirmorum ad consilium episcopi perpetuos et idoneos assignet vicarios, qui cuncta ad eccl'ias pertinentia, exceptis tribus decimis tantum Bladi, (viz.)

We find little in the records touch∣ing the vill of Elton, save what is noted relating to the right of presentation to this rectorial church, whereby it appears, that the manor with the advowson was possessed by tenants in common, perhaps by having descended to females so early as 1435. In 1378, the estate had descended to Thomas the son of Sir William Gower, knt. whose widow presented the last rector, and Thomas's guardian,
<PB N="166" REF="224"/>during his minority, presented in his right. In 1435, (Percebride the rector, presented by the Gower family, being dead) by an inquisition it is stated, that Will. Bowes, of Dalden, had two successive turns, and the right of presenting was then in him. In 1571, Sir Geo. Bowes, of Daldon, knt. being dead, Cuthbert Collingwood, of Eslington, in the county of Northumberland, and Dorothy his wife, one of Sir George's daughters and coheiresses, presented a clerk. It appears afterwards, that John Errington, of Worsall, gentleman, had such right of pre∣sentation as formerly appertained to the Bowes's; and John Jefferson, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> in 1662, excercised such right as had appertained to the Gowers: This proportion descended to Miss Ann Jefferson, who intermarried with Mr Tho. Hogg, of Durham, whose son and heir, John Hogg, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> of the Inner Temple, now pos∣sesses it. The estate of the Erringtons was purchased by Sir Robert Shafto, knt. recorder of Newcastle on Tyne, in 1682, and it is now vested in Rob. Shafto, of Whitworth, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> his lineal descendant, who has two turns, and Mr Hogg one turn in succession in the right of presentation.</P>

He also held of Will.

For Barnardcastle being a special liberty or jurisdiction, as will appear in the sequel, the bishop's officers seldom entered therein, or took cognizance of the members thereof. Sir George Vane, knt. one of the younger sons of Sir Harry Vane, of Raby Castle, is the first of the family we find settled at Longnewton, where he died in May, 1679.—<HI>See pedigree of the family at Raby.</HI></P>
<P>The church of Longnewton * has no ailes or tower: The chancel is about six paces in width, and in length about seven paces. On the south side is a niche, containing two seats, divided by a small column, and ornamented with some
<PB N="168" REF="226"/>pierced work: It is lighted by a window of three divisions to the east under a pointed, and separated from the nave by a round, arch. The nave, of equal width with the chancel, is eighteen paces in length.</P>
<P>There was a chantry in this church dedicated to the Virgin Mary, as appears by the copyhold books marked D. p. 472, Jun. 25.12 Ep. Rob. but when or by whom founded is not said or known.—Richard Bowes, cap. Gildae, ibid. 1501.</P>

<P>The manor of Cotom Conyers in this parish takes its name from the family of Coniers, to whom it anciently belonged.

Haec omnia con∣firmo regia auctoritate, &amp;c. testibus Thoma Cantuarien. 1169. On the dissolution of that monastery the advowson came to the crown, and has been retained to this day<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is great reason to doubt whether this church is implied by that description. In the first instance, we have not the least evidence to prove the Baliols ever had any possessions here; in the next place, the grant to St Mary's being connected with that of Gainford, a place so greatly distant, and in no instance united thereto, renders the evidence suspicious. The possessions of the Baliols lay in the north-west part of the county, where there is a Stainton lying on the High-street or Roman Road, and might conse∣quently be called Stainton in le Strata, as well as Street-le-ham have its name from the same cause. We beg the reader will suspend his judgment on this matter until he has compared the evidence presented under the subject of Stainton, in the chapelry of Barnardcastle; where he will observe there was an∣ciently a dependent chapelry under Gainford, and Gainford, with all its dependent chapels, was given by the Baliols to St Mary's. It is not to be doubted this church belonged to St Mary's, but how it came to that monastery is difficult to determine.

<HEAD>The Parish of <HI>HAUGHTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Advancing to the westward, we enter that part of the parish of HAUGHTON which lies in Stockton ward, and comprehends the chapelry of Sadberge, with other townships.</P>
<P>Much has been said of SADBERGE in the progress of this work, to which the reader will revert, in order to prevent repetition. It was anciently a county, and
<PB N="173" REF="231"/>had its proper sheriffs, coroners, and other civil officers; and there the sheriff held his tourn. A court of assize was held there by the justices itinerant, commissioned by the bishops of Durham. It was in distant antiquity, and still is, said to be a local earldom; in the time of bishop Bury, divided into two wards, the east and west ward: Sadberge had the privileges of a wapentake. In the laws of Edward
<PB N="174" REF="232"/>the Confessor it is written, <HI>Et quod Angli vocant Hundredum, supradicti comitatus vocant Wapentachium:</HI> Hoveden derives it, <HI>a tactu armorum;</HI> and describes the ceremony, <HI>cum quis accipiebat praefecturam wapentachij die statuto in loco ubi con∣sucverant congregari, omnes majores contra eum conveniebant, et descendente de equo suo, omnes assurgebant ei. Ipse vero, erecta lancea sua, ab omnibus secundum morem foedus accipiebat: Omnes enim quotquot venissent cum lanceis suis ipsius hastam tangebant, et ita confirmabant per contactum armorum pace palem concessa, &amp;c.</HI> The county of Durham was then divided into four wards, Darlington, Chester, Easington, and Stockton, but now Sadberge, or so much of it as the ancient east ward of that county comprised, is comprehended in Stockton ward. In the pleas of quo war∣ranto, in the time of Edward I. it was certified, that the bishop had his coroner of Sadberge. A court of pleas was also held at Sadberge, and fines were regu∣larly levied there of lands within that liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haec est finalis concordia facta in curia domini <HI>Dunelmensis</HI> episcopi apud <HI>Sadberge</HI> die mercurii proxima ante sestum sancti Laurencii Martyris anno regni <HI>Henrici</HI> regis Anglioe et Franciae <HI>sexti</HI> post conquestum vicesimo septimo et pontificatus domini <HI>Roberti</HI> episcopi Dunelmensis anno duodecimo coram <HI>Willielmo Nevill</HI> Dom. de Fauconberge, <HI>Thoma Nevill, Thoma Lumley, Willielmo Eure, Thoma Fulthorpe,</HI> militibus; <HI>Johanne Pockyngton, Roberto Beaumont,</HI> clerico; <HI>Roberto Danby, Christophoro Boynton, Johanne Lounde,</HI> cler∣ico; <HI>Willielmo Rackett,</HI> et <HI>Ricardo Wenden,</HI> justiciariis ipsius episcopi apud <HI>Sadberge.</HI> Et preterea scilicet die lunae proxima post sestum sancte Luciae Virginis anno regni regis praedictae vicesimo octavo et pontisicatus dicti domini episcopi anno duodecimo supradictae coram eisdem justiciariis et aliis dicti domini episcopi sidelibus tune ibi presentibus ibidem concessa et recordata inter <HI>Willelmum Blackwell</HI> capellanum <HI>Thomam de Baines</HI> et <HI>Thomam Counden Querentem</HI> et <HI>Thomam Norman</HI> de <HI>Novo Castro super Tynam</HI> et <HI>Margaretam</HI> uxorem ejus <HI>desorcientes</HI> de duobus m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssuagiis et sexaginta acris terrae cum pertinenciis in <HI>Cotom Amundeville</HI> unde placitum convencionis summonitum suit inter eos in cadem curia, scilicet, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Mr Mickleton points out one in the fifth year of Edward II. the record was in the possession of Sir William Chaytor, of Croft. In the time of bishop Langley it was asserted, that Barnard∣castle, Marwood, Cleatlam, Eggleston, Langton, Middleton in Teesdale, New∣biggin, Stainton, and other places in the western extremity of the county of Durham, were members of this wapentake. There was a gaol for prisoners in Sadberge; and sundry manors and lands were held by the special service of maintaining the same, and supporting the prisoners. The bailiffs common fee was 40 <ABBR>s.</ABBR></P>
<P>In Lambarde's Dictionary, p. 324, this place is noted as follows, <Q>Satbergia “in Chron. Lindisf." After speaking of the sale to bishop Pudsey, he adds, This Satberge was at that tyme and longe sence called a countye, conteyninge (as I thinke) the greatest portion of that which we now calle the byshopricke of Durham. I heare of some gentlemen of that quarter, that theare be dyvers fines yet extant, acknowledged before the bishop in his court of Satberge, and that the most part of the countrye resorted to courte thyther, which gyveth me
<PB N="175" REF="233"/>to thinke, that it should be called SACBERGE of Sac and byrig (the Saxon wordes), which signifie the court of causes or plees, from which signification Socburgh before is not muche different. It standethe upon a hil, and is now called Sedbergh, which Bergh (the latter part of the worde) soundeth as much in the Saxon as Hyll now with us in Inglishe, and thereof if any man like better to have it deryved of Sacbeosh, that is the court upon the hyl, or the hyll of plees, I give him as free libertie as I myselfe would be gladd to enjoye in any such matter of conjecture. Matt. Paris calleth it Segefield, which is a large town within the bishopricke, and therefore belike, king Richard gave ”the byshop that also.</Q></P>
<P>The village of Sadberge is now an insignificant place, compared to its ancient consequence; it stands on the crown of a fine eminence, which rises with an easy ascent from every side to such an elevation, that it commands an extensive prospect over the south-east part of the county of Durham, and up Teesdale as far as the high grounds above Barnardcastle, but of no great distance northward; and is a distinct object from the environs of Raby, Kirkmerrington, Quarrington, and Hartlepool. The ground on which the present chapel stands is most elevated, and appears to have been forced, and is trenched round; from whence it may be presumed that there stood the castle, gaol, and court-house in ancient times. The stones of which the chapel is built appear to have been taken from ancient structures; for such materials are very scarce in that part of the country, the com∣mon edifices being chiefly of brick. In bishop Hatfield's Survey, we find that all the lands were held by military service; so noble a possession was Sadberge anciently! Will. Fawcon held four burgages and thirty acres and a half of land in the fields there by fealty and suit of court, from three weeks to three weeks, and paying a double relief; and he, with others, holding lands within the wapen∣take, (to wit) the baron of Graystock, the prioress of Neseham, Robert de Ogles, Walter Taylboys, Isabell the wife of John Percy de Kildale, John de As∣layby, the heirs of Alex. Surteys, and others, had the keeping of the gaol and prison, and were answerable for the escape of prisoners. There were forty-one, together with Fawcon, who held eighty-four burgages and lands under the same tenure. Besides the ancient burgagers there were new ones specified in the Survey. The demesne lands are stated to consist of twenty-three oxgangs, each containing sixteen acres.</P>
<P>After what has been stated from Hatfield's Survey, we must note, that many small proprietors of lands are found in the inquisitions post mortem, and other records in the bishop's offices; to go through which in a course of descents would be at once laborious and unprofitable. Among those are named, in bishop Beaumont's time, Kays and Mortons; in bishop Bury's time, Marshalls, Chib∣burns, and Lucas of Norton; in bishop Hatfield's time, Le Wrays, Waryns, Sherwynds, Hacksmall, Bedales, Huwetsons, Ings, and sundry others; the Wrays and Marshalls held their lands for many generations. From all these records it appears, that the burgages were held in free borough tenure, by service at the bo∣rough court; and the lands by military service, and in soccage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>For note, see following page</HI><NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">— Casson ad Willo de Maundeby.

<P>COTOM MUNDEVILLE derived its name from the family who possessed the manor; and we find the Amundevills named there in the beginning of the 13th century. It became the estate of Galfrid Russel by the grant of Tho. de Amun∣deville, who is stiled in that instrument of Woctona or Witton, to find and sup∣port a chaplain to celebrate divine service daily in the chapel of Mary Magdalen of Cotom, for the souls of the said Thomas, Ralph his father, and Clarice his mother, and Ralph Tingrie, under certain penalties in the instrument specified; and on default, he grants, that he will convey over to the bishop of Durham the said manor in free alms, &amp;c. The date of this instrument may be fixed about the year 1273, by one of the penalties for default, being specified to arise <HI>in festo Pent. anno gr'e. m<SUP>o</SUP>. cc<SUP>o</SUP>. septuagesimo q'rto.</HI> Alex. de Balliolo, the first witness, died

This grant bears no date.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Several of the preceding charters having no date to them, but concluding with <HI>his testibus,</HI> it is not easy to determine the age of each deed; but in order to resolve this difficulty, it may be necessary to consider what has been observed on this subject by our antiquaries and lawyers, who have left us some rules, whereby we may judge of the antiquity of a deed or charter, either from the seals affixed to them, or by the introduction or beginning of a deed, or by the conclusion, which two last circumstances were not permanent and settled, but changed and altered in different ages. The industrious and sagacious David Casley, in his Catalogue of MSS. in the King's Library, has, besides these, shewn us a way to compute the age of a MS. even by the different methods of writing in different times, and the different characters and abbreviations: and he says, that he has studied the age of MSS. so much, and has so often compared MSS. without, with those that have happened to have dates, that he has little doubt as to that particular; nay, as by looking in people's faces, most men are able to guess right, that this person is 40, that about 50, and another about 60, without being able to give any reason for those guesses, so he thinks that by frequent inspections, he has attained the faculty of guessing the age of MSS.; and that even before he searches more narrowly for certain <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> for their age. Now, according to another rule of Mr. Casley's, the deed from Amundeville is above 600 years old, the word <HI>"est"</HI> being thus written—; for, says he in MSS. above 600 years old, the word <HI>"est"</HI> is often so written, <HI>with a dash between two points:</HI> now it is plain, if this be a certain rule to judge by, that deed must be of such antiquity, and leaves no room to doubt it is above 600 years standing, the word <HI>"est"</HI> in it being, in two instances, within the compass of two lines thus abbreviated.</NOTE> We find several others named in the ancient records, who held lands in Coatham; Robert, the son of Robert de Levingthorpe, released to Ralph de Rickenhall, and Agnes his wife, A. D. 1331, his lands there. John Capellanus de Cotum conveyed and confirmed to Rickenhall and his wife, all his lands and tenements there; and Thomas, the son of Thomas de Skyrmingham, conveyed to Alane de Cunsclive his lands in Cotum and Riccondale. By an inquisition <HI>post mortem,</HI> taken on the death of Ralph de Rickenhall, in the 16th year of Bishop Hatfield, it is stated, that he held of the bishop in capite, certain messuages and lands at Coatham by homage, fealty, and suit of court, from three weeks to three weeks, rendering to the lord a pound of cumin; also held of Alicia Surtees and Thomas de Graystanes other lands, rendering a pound of cumin, and <HI>unum par. serotecarum,</HI> and 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent; and also of Robert de Skyrmingham other lands there, of 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent. We do not trace the possessions of this family further in these records. In the 17th year of the same prelate, by an inquisition <HI>post mortem,</HI> taken on the death of Thomas de
<PB N="178" REF="236"/>Graystanes, at Sadberg, before the same escheator, William de Claxton, it is stated, that he held of the bishop in capite, several messuages, a moiety of a water corn-mill, and divers lands at Coatham, by homage, fealty, ward, and marriage, and 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent, payable at the bishop's manor there, and a certain rent payable at the exchequer, in lieu of wardsilver and woodhyre. He also held of the Rector of Halghton, land at Coatham of 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent. William his son and heir died possessed of the same estates, leaving several coheiresses.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">29 Hatf. ap. Sadb. cor. R. Umframville Esc. in Com.

It appears that the family of Amundeville was fallen into female issue, or had aliened their estates in Coatham; for, by an inquisition taken on the death of Robert Conyers Chiv, it is stated, that he held the manor and lands there jointly with Alicia his wife, to them and the heirs of the body of the said Alicia, of Thomas, son and heir of Alexander Surtees, by military service; and that Robert Conyers was their son and heir apparent. How long they possessed these estates, the records do not shew.</P>

<PB N="179" REF="237"/>chancel and nave, without any ailes; the chancel is ten paces in length, and four in width, and the altar is elevated, with three steps to the railing; the whole is wainscotted with oak in pannels. The nave is divided from the chancel by a circular arch, is twenty-nine paces in length, and seven paces in width, uniformly and neatly stalled with oak. The reading-desk and pulpit are placed in opposite corners, at the entrance into the chancel. There is a gallery at the west end: the font has a neat tabernacle cover of wood, with a dove resting on the top.</P>
<P>There was a guild in this church, dedicated to St. Mary; and in the year 1498, John Esh took of the lord one cottage, with its appurtenances, formerly Robert Johnson's, which Edward Becham surrendered to John, to be held by him and his sequels, for the use of the guild of St. Mary, in the church of Haughton.

<P>The rector of this church has a customary manor in right of his rectory, in the township of Haughton; the lands and tenements held under him are estates of inheritance, and pass by deed of alienation and admittance on the roll or entry in the court book; or otherwise by surrender before the lord, with entry in the court book; which operates as admittance to the roll in other customary manors. From neglect, the customary services are not retained, or are little known. By the interfering of this customary manor, we gain little information touching the ancient possessors of estates holding under the see, from the records in the bishop's repositories.</P>
<P>Those who held lands under the Bishop of Durham here, were subject to several services and money payments, particularly the bond tenants, as in other parts of the demesne; of those at Haughton, we find they were charged for wodlades <HI>tolnet. cervis,</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Saxons had a duty called <HI>Drinckleum,</HI> and such tenants may be called <HI>Cervisarij.</HI> Doomfday.

The Lords de Neville, who held the manor of Oxhenhall, at the time of making the Bolden Buke, paid yearly for the same to the bishop 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> in lieu of services. Whesoe paid for pannage, wodlades, wood∣fines, smith's fee, and punder, certain money payments.</P>
<P>In suppliment to what has been said of Haughton in the annals of the bishops, we observe in Bishop Hatfield's time, Richard de Brunton held lands of the see
<PB N="181" REF="239"/>in capite, by homage, fealty, and a certain rent, payable at the exchequer.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">22 Hatfield. ap. Dun. cor. Will. de Menevyle vic.

The family of Ingleby also held lands there of the same tenure.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. Hatf. ap. Dun. cor. R. d'Umframville Ese. in co. Dun. — An. p.

After this period of time, we find that the Earls of Westmorland possessed several small estates here, together with certain rent charges out of Tirwhit's lands, and others, formerly the estate of the Earl of Warwick.</P>
<P>On the 9th of April, 1666, a decree was obtained in the bishop's court, for a division and inclosure in Haughton;<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">In the auditor's office, lib. L. L. p. 318.—HODGSON's MS.</NOTE> there was assigned to the bishop, in lieu of his waste in the township, a parcel of ground called Dickins's Parrock, containing one acre, one rood, and seventeen perches of land; the rector had assigned to him East and West Holmes, Houndwell's, Wetings, and Burdon Briggs, together with twenty-eight acres, in lieu of thirty-six cattlegates.</P>
<P>In WHESOE, four tenants held four messuages and eleven oxgangs of land by foreign service. Among the bond tenants, we find John Shepherd named; the family of Shepherds are still possessed of Whesoe, two maiden ladies being now the present representatives of that house. The services of the bond tenants, who were then six in number, differs no further from those in Bolden Buke, than that they wrought at the mill as the tenants of Haughton. The malt paid 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> the forge 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> woodlades 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> woodsilver 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and ten hens. The punder paid seven hens. The service of the cottagers was commuted for xvj <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent, and when they wrought they only paid vj <ABBR>d.</ABBR> For the pasture called the Flaske, the tenants paid 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> The ancient services are then stated, due from John Redhead, for the lands which were Robert's, the son of Mildred. Also the services of William Qweshowe, and William Walkerfield. In the inquisitions, post mortem, we find the posterity of Redhead and Walkerfield, for several generations succeeding to the respective lands. The family of Evers held a messuage and a croft here in Bishop Langley's time, and
<PB N="182" REF="240"/>Roger Thornton died seized of a messuage, and two oxgangs of land, each oxgang containing twenty-four acres. His possessions, as before noted, centred in the Lumleys.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. Rog. Ao. 24th Lanley.</NOTE></P>
<P>BERMTON gave name to a resident family before the time of Bishop Hatfield, in the fifth year of whose pontificate, John de Bermton died seized of a messuage and three oxgangs of land there, held of the lady of Skyrmingham, by fealty and half a mark rent, which came to him on the death of his nephew, Thomas de Bermton, who held one of the before-mentioned oxgangs of Robert de Skyrmingham, ren∣dering three grains of pepper.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

William, and inq. p. m. Thomas de Walkerfield, Ao. 12th Skirlaw.</NOTE> In the 17th year of Bishop Skirlaw, Thomas Colvil, chiv. with Johan his wife, were seized, by virtue of a fine levied in the courts at Durham, of the manors of Skyr∣mingham and Bermton, held of the prior of Durham in capite. By this inquisi∣tion, John Percy of Kildale, was found to be their heir. The family of Coniers, held lands here of the prior of Durham, in the time of Bishop Langley. In the 14th of Bishop Nevill,<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">Rot. m. No. 53.</NOTE> the prior and convent of Durham obtained licence to purchase lands in Bermton, and other places therein named.</P>
<P>In respect to the lands which were held of the priory of Durham, we have very insufficient evidence in the Bishop's records, as the priory had its own proper officers, who held their courts within their manors; so that when such are specified in the inquisitions, taken by sheriffs and escheators, they are noted very imperfect∣ly. It is not till Bishop Skirlaw's time, we find Skyrmingham named, when on the death of Isabel, called the lady of that manor, in the third year of the prelate, the inquisition states, that she held in her own right, from the death of William her father, a moiety of the manor of Skyrmingham; and the other moiety by the grant of Thomas de Esh, which were held of the priory of Durham, at six marks rent, and John, the son of Thomas de Esh, was found to be her heir. This Thomas
<PB N="183" REF="241"/>of Esh, it is presumed, was the Thomas Colvil before-mentioned,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. William Huddleston, 2d Neville.
<P>He died, seized in fee tail, of the manors of Bermton and Skyrmingham. By deed, dated 18th King Henry VI. the 4th of November, these manors were limited to William Huddleston, and the heirs of his body, remainder to John Walkerfeld, the son of Matilda, the daughter of John, who was the wife of Thomas Colvill, deceased, and the heirs of his body; remainder to Alice his sister, and the heirs of her body; remainder to Matilda, the sister of William Huddleston; remainder to the right heirs of Roger de Esh for ever.</P>
<P>Inq. p. m. J. Walkerfeld, same year of Neville.</P>
<P>He held some lands at Bermton, called Tailboi's lands, and other lands at Skyrmingham, held of the heirs of Richard de Esh.</P></NOTE> who then held the manor of Esh; and afterwards became possessed of this manor;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Esh.</NOTE> which passed, as we are informed, together to the family of Smythe, of whom Sir Edward Smythe is the present representative.</P>
<P>The King restored to the church of Durham, in Bishop Flambard's time, Burdon, Carleton, and Accliff, which the people of Northumberland had injuriously with∣held; and the prelate gave up the same to the convent, after having retained them without any just cause, for some time.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vid. Annals of Bishop Flamb. 2. 1.</NOTE> Several succeeding prelates granted their licences for the convent's obtaining lands here. In Bishop Hatfield's time, Olivia de Walworth, held a messuage and four oxgangs of land in Great Burdon of the prior of Durham; and in the same prelate's time, Goceline Surtees held a messuage and two oxgangs there. The family of Inglebies also held lands here. At this time, Moorcroft Wastell has a neat mansion house in Burdon.</P>

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF DARLINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>TO the west of Haughton, lies the parish of Darlington. The town of DARLINGTON, which gives name to one of the four wards of the county, is a large and populous place, stands on the side of an hill, gently inclining to the cast, with several streets, which are called Norgate, Briggate, and Backwellgate, branching out from the great square, or main body of the town, where the market is held; one that runs parallel with the high part of the square, called Skinnergate, and another parallel with the south row, called Hungate.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Bullweand leads from the market-place to Hungate, and is so called from the figure of a bull placed against the corner house, which anciently belonged to the Bulmer family, whose cognizance was a bull passant.</NOTE> The high row of the square is on an elevated situation, and commands a pleasant prospect to the east. At the foot of the square stands the church, an elegant Gothic fabric; and near thereto, a stone bridge, of three arches,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Formerly of nine arches—lately rebuilt with three arches.</NOTE> over the river Skern, communicating with the great roads to Stockton and Yarm.</P>
<P>This town is surrounded with some of the best lands in the county, and conse∣quently the market is superior in the articles of corn, cattle, sheep, and wool, to many in the north of England. There is a large manufactory carried on here, in
<PB N="184" REF="242"/>the lower woollen stuffs, called tammeys, moreens, harateens, chineas, and other articles, in which the long wool is used, this being an abundant market for that species of wool. Also a great manufactory, of damasks, diapers, huckabacks, checks, and sheet cloth, with other linens: it is computed, that no less than 1000 looms are constantly employed here, which, with the attendant articles of the trade, occasions daily work for multitudes of dyers, spinners, combers, and children, who wind the thread and yarn. The happiness of this situation for a manufac∣tory is, that the inhabitants are abundantly supplied with all the necessaries of life from the adjacent country, at a cheap rate, and the influx of foreign money brought hither by labour and the staples of the country, passes not away for the maintenance of the people, into distant parts; but it is expended with the neighbouring farmers, and they return it back upon the shops, and so, in a con∣tinued vortex, the accummulated wealth circulates to enrich the town and its vicinity.</P>
<P>Darlington is a place of antiquity, and a borough by prescription under the Bishop of Durham: soon after the episcopal seat was settled at Durham, we are told, that Styr, son of Ulphus,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Itin. vol. viii. p. 52.</NOTE> gave this place, with its appendages, to Saint Cuthbert, a donation made with such solemnity, that the King and Archbishop Wulston were present when Aldune received the gift.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. v. i. p. 330. Ibid v. ii. p. 377. Sym. Dunelm. p. 149. Vol. i. p. 315.</NOTE> A conjecture may be hazarded on the etymology of the name, doer or doerling, signifying <HI>dilectus,</HI> and tun or ton, <HI>villa,</HI> hence a chosen town, built on holy land, and the favourite place of the prelates. From Turgot, and other monastic writers, it appears, that when William Carilepho removed the seculars from the cathedral church, that Darling∣ton was one of the receptacles appointed for that body of religious.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Symeon Dunelm. p. 220, 221, &amp;c.

<P>Tanner's Notitia, p. 114. Here was a collegiate church, consisting of a dean and three prebendaries, and founded by Hugh Pusar, or Pudsey, Bishop of Durham, and dedicated to St. Cuthbert. In the Lincoln taxation, these four portions are valued at 73 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> per annum.

Lel. Col. v. i. p. 385, makes William de Carilepho founder. Vide Angl. Sacr. vol. i. p. 724—1368, Pat. 42, Edw. III. p. 1, m.—1370, Pat. 44, Edw. III. p. 1.—1390, Pat. 13, Rich. II. m. 19.</P></NOTE> We are not told who first erected a church here, or where the first holy edifice stood; but it is natural to suppose, soon after the above donation, that in this large district a church would be built; and on the translation of the seculars before mentioned, a comfortable establishment provided for them here. To the great and powerful prelate, HUGH PUDSEY, the present structure owes its origin: the bishop, as ob∣served, was under the frown of his sovereign, for the supposed offence of having extorted great sums of money from the subjects of his palatinate, on pretence of redeeming the king from captivity, which he put into his own coffe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s: guilty of such a trespass on the public, (if the fact was so) he was highly imprudent in pro∣ceeding at that period in such magnificent works, for he was then building this

The expence of the fabric before us was immense; for the stone of which it is built, according to the opinion of judicious workmen, was brought above twelve miles, from the quarries of Cockfield-fell. This prelate also, about the year 1164,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 181.</NOTE> erected a mansion house near the church, and instituted a deanery, with three secular canons or prebendaries.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Darlington Collegiate Church.</HI>

<P>This church is in the form of a cross, with the tower and spire rising in the centre. The elegant spire being struck by lightning, Tuesday the 17th of July, 1750, was so shattered, as to render it necessary to have the upper part of it taken down; in rebuilding it, the mason omitted the old ornaments, the rolls at the angles, which deprive it of much beauty. The chancel is eleven paces in length, and seven in width; the ascent to the altar is by three steps: three stalls in the south wall for the officiating ministers, rise above each other in gradation towards the east: in the north wall is a spacious recess, a place assigned for the monument of some distinguished personage. The chancel, below the rails, is neatly stalled with oak, having nine seats on each side. It was originally lighted on each side by two tiers of windows, three above and three below, at equal distances, orna∣mented with round pilasters and arches of various members, some of the capitals foliated: the east end is modern; has four lights, which, being very different from the old windows, injures the beauty of the building. The chancel is separated from the nave by a low pointed arch, with three ribs, like bridge-work, two paces deep; the roof is supported by a blunt pointed arch, set with diamond∣cut studs. The old rood-loft is converted into a gallery. The nave is in length thirty paces, and fifteen in width, with a transept, or cross aile, twenty-six paces in length, and five in width, both limbs of which are exactly similar: the tower rises in the centre, from four clustered pillars, supporting uniform arches, and forming a square of six paces: the side ailes have each three pillars, exclusive of those of the tower, supporting blunt-pointed arches, on one side the first column is round, the second octagonal, the third clustered; on the other side, the first
<PB N="187" REF="246"/>octagonal, the second round, the third clustered. The centre of the nave has four lights on each side; the roof is ceiled. The side ailes open into the transept by a pointed arch, ornamented with a variety of filletings; they are uniformly lighted by three windows, each having low round arches within, and a square moulding without. The ends of the transept are uniformly lighted by two upper and two lower windows, ornamented with small round pilasters, belted in the middle, and various rolls in the archings; in each limb are two upper windows and two lower windows to the east and west. The west door is highly finished with archings and pilasters, cylindrical and octagonal interchangeably. There are six musical bells in the tower. The church is kept in good order, but the inward appearance is greatly hurt by irregular pews and galleries.</P>
<P>There were four chauntries in this church, but by whom or when founded, we have no information. The chauntry of St. James had revenues of the yearly value of 6 <ABBR>l.</ABBR><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">CHAPLAINS.—William Wighteman, 1501, was paid 60 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> a-year by the bishop.—Ralph Swallwell, 1523, he was paid 60 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> a year by the bishop.</NOTE>—the chauntry of All Saints 4 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 19 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—the chauntry of Robert Marshall, which had an endowment, as afterwards noted—and the chauntry of the Blessed Mary, the revenue of which is not known.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CHAPLAIN.—John Coman, oc. 1344.</NOTE> There was also a free chapel or perpetual chauntry of Badlifelde, alias Badlefeld, alias Battlefield, but when or by whom it was founded, we have no evidence, or to the honour of what saint it was dedicated; it was in the manor and parish of Darlington, and in the patronage of the bishop: the chaplain, or cantarist, had an annual sum paid him out of the bishop's exchequer <HI>ab antiquo.</HI> There is a place, a mile west of Darlington, called Baddles,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">In Bolden Book, under title Blackwell, we find it thus mentioned—"<HI>Et idem Adam reddit pro Herbag. de Bathela</HI> xxxij <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>."—and in Hatfield's Survey—<HI>"Tenet Ten. vocat le Castlehill cum Herbag. de Bathley contin. iiij acr. prati et pastur."</HI></NOTE> where, it is probable, the chapel stood, though no remains of such edifice are now to be discovered; in this situation, it would be convenient to Blackwell and Cockerton: there is nothing in history that can be applied to the supposed name of Battlefield, except what is after mentioned from the Scala Chronica, in the time of King Edward III. It has been observed— <Q>That care “ought to be taken to keep up the good and ancient practice of making annual perambulations, which would prevent the limits of parishes coming in question. In ancient times, these perambulations fell into two abuses, feasting and super∣stition, being at length performed in the nature of processions, with banners, bells, lights, and praying at crosses, &amp;c. When processions were forbidden by Queen Elizabeth, the useful and inoffensive parts of perambulations were re∣tained in these words—<HI>"But yet for retaining of the perambulation of the circuits of parishes, they shall once in the year, at the time accustomed, with the curate and substantial men of the parish, walk about the parishes, as they were accustomed, and ”at their return to the church, make their common prayers, &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Bolden Book<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Alias Buke.</NOTE> is the first record in which Darlington is particularly noted; and it informs us, there were forty oxgangs of land there, in the hands of villain tenants, for each of which the lord received five shillings: their service consisted of mow∣ing
<PB N="188" REF="247"/>the bishop's meadows, winning and leading the hay, for which work they received a corody; inclosing the limits of the court, from whence the term, <HI>"The verge of the court,"</HI> seems to be derived; working at the mill, bringing one load of wood for every oxgang, and carrying the bishop's baggage on his circuit, and also carrying yearly three loads of wine, herrings and salt. There were twelve tenants who each held an oxgang of land, and paid rent as the villains, but did not perform the like services: yet served on the bishop's ambassies. Osbertus Bate, and Wybert's sons, held lands under the last-mentioned duties, &amp;c. The smith held viij acres, for iron-work about the carts of Little Walton, and for small iron∣works within Darlington court. The cottage-men served to make the ricks of hay, bear in the corn, and repair the mills. The pinder held nine acres of land, and had his thraves like others in that office, and provided fivescore hens and five hundred eggs for the household. The mills of Darlington, Haughton, and Ketton, paid thirty marks. The burgagers, dyers, and <HI>fermes,</HI> rendered ten marks. The <HI>ferme,</HI> or firma, our best law expositors define to be a royal tribute, for the sove∣reign's entertainment for one night on his journeys, and it was the badge of a royal borough or vill. In Doomsday Book, <HI>Comes meriton T. R. E. reddebat firmam unius noctis:</HI> it is also named in King Edgar's charter to Ely. Besides the base tenures, there were many tenants in capite, of whom, in Bishop Bury's time, we find John, son of William de Strethe,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. 5 Bury.

The tolls of fairs and markets, with the profits of the mills, suits of the tenants of Wheshow, bakehouse, assize of bread and beer, profits of the borough court, and of the dyers, produced no less a sum than fourscore and ten pounds; and the farmers of the borough rights, with other receipts, paid a rent of four∣score and fourteen pounds six shillings. There was an inclosed park<NOTE N="§ §" PLACE="foot">The lands adjoining the palace are still called the parks or demesnes of the house.</NOTE> belonging to this manor, paled by Bishop Beke. Gocelinus Surtays held several burgages in Darlington, and Ralph de Nevill, Knight, held lands here, in the latter end of
<PB N="189" REF="248"/>Bishop Hatfield's episcopacy. In the 10th year of Bishop Skirlaw, John Tesedale died seized of lands in the Westfield of Darlington, <HI>"in quad. plac. voc. Hell,"</HI> which lands, in Bishop Langley's time, were the possessions of the Eures. Among the many ancient owners of lands there, besides those before mentionened, were the Wendaways, Lumleys, Indhows, Aslakby, Thorton, and the Earls of Westmorland, to attend to whose particular properties, would be voluminous and wearisome.</P>
<P>The bishop's palace was placed close upon the banks of the river Skerne: Bishop Cosins restored this house, it having then become very ruinous; it has been totally neglected within this last century, and is now farmed by the town of the bishop's housekeeper, (who holds it by patent for life) as a workhouse for their poor.</P>
<P>Few historical facts occur here: King Edward I. 1291, was at Darlington, and issued from thence his summons to fifty-seven of the chief military tenants of the north. In the Scala Chronica, we observe, that in the time of King Edward III. <Q>“Archibald Douglas toke great prayes in the bisshopriche of Duresme, and encountrid with a band of Englischmen at Darlington, and killed many of ”them.</Q></P>
<P>It is observed before, that there was a chauntry in Darlington church, called Marshall's Chauntry, the endowment of which, we presume, was ample; the possessions belonging to it remained in the crown, from the time of the dissolution, till the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when the inhabitants of Darlington, sensible of the great utility of a liberal education to rising generations, applied to Henry Earl of Westmorland, then in great power, and Bishop Pilkington, to use their interest at court, for obtaining the foundation of a grammar school, which the queen was graciously pleased to grant, by her charter, dated the 15th of June, 1567, endow∣ing the same with lands and tenements at Darlington and Heighington, in this county, and Thornaby, in the county of York, formerly the possessions of Marshall's Chauntry. The charter remains in good preservation, wrote in a beautiful character, with the great seal appendant.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The school house flands near the river.

<P>There are certain water pools in the neighbourhood of Darlington, called <HI>Hell Kettles,</HI> which have for many ages been esteemed curious. In Brompton's Chro∣nicle they are thus spoken of— <Q><HI>Ann.</HI> 1179. <HI>Infra vero idem natale Domini contigit “apud Oxenbale quodam mirabile a seculo inauditum, exilicet, quod in ipsa Domini Hugonis Episcopi Dunelmensis culturâ, terra se in altum it a vehementer elavit quod summis montium cacuminibus abaequaretur, et quod super alta templorum pinnacula emineret, et illa altitudo ab hora diei nona usq. ad occasum solis permansit. Sole vero occidente, eum tam horribili strepitu cecidit, quod omnes cumulum illum videntes, et strepitum casus illius audientes perterruit; unde multi timore illo obierunt; nam tellus ”eum absorbuit, et puteum profundissimum ibidem fecit.</HI></Q> Lord Lyttleton, in his Note in the Appendix to the Life of King Henry II. says— <Q>Camden supposes “these deep pits in a field near Darlington, which, in his time, the common people called Hell Kettles, to be the remains of this very extraordinary rising and sinking of the earth; but, in the account above given, only one pit is mentioned, and naturally the falling in of an heap of soil so raise would form but one. This hill probably was puffed up by subterraneous fires, like that in the Lucrine Lake, now called Monte-novo; but what has filled up the chasm ”caused by its sinking, or divided it into different cavities, it is not easy to say.</Q> There are other ancient authors who speak of these pits in the like manner. In Leland's Itin. vol. VI. it is noted, <Q>that Doctor Bellasis told him, that a “dukke, markid after the fascion of dukkes of the bishoprike of Duresme, was put in into one of the pooles called Hel Ketelles, betwixt Darlington and Tesebank, and after was found at **** bridge, upon Tese thereby, wher Gervalx (Croft, the seat of the Clervaux famely) duellith, and that be it the people had a certain conjecture, that there was <HI>specus subter</HI> betwixt the ij ”places.</Q> These authorities, (there being more of like nature) will suffice to shew what ideas people formerly had of this place, and serve to introduce the following remarks:—We observed, that in the records of Bishop Skirlaw, who entered upon this see in 1389, we find certain lands called <HI>Hell,</HI> which became afterwards the estate of the Evers; whether the pools took their name from the land, or the land from them, the reader will form his own conjecture. The first seems most reasonable, on account of the authorities after quoted; and as the monastic chronicles were not of so ancient date as the event recorded, the scribe would rehearse nothing but such
<PB N="191" REF="250"/>traditional tale as then prevailed. Lord Lyttleton observes, that the account is of one pit only, whereas there are four, and a long canal which unites two of them, and a third is joined by a short cut. The complete History of Durham says— <Q>“Such as have more lately considered them, think them like some old wrought coalpits, that are downed, but cannot find that ever any coal or other mineral has ”been dug thereabouts.</Q>—It is not probable they were ancient coal-works, for the diameter of one of the largest is not less than 114 feet, and the least 75 feet. The same authority proceeds— <Q>II. That they are full of water, and that not hot, “as Mr. Camden was informed, but cold up to the very brim, and keeping much the same level with the Tees, which runs near them. But as to the nature of the water, the curious differ, some saying it is derived by some subterraneous passes from the river, &amp;c. but others assert, that the waters are of a different ”kind from the river water, because it curdles milk, and will not bear soap.</Q> It is true, the water is cold; but though the pools are near the level of the river, they are never influenced thereby in great floods, which would otherwise shew a sudden rising, falling, agitation, or boiling up, if the water of the river was forced thither, up any level, or by virtue of siphonical operations and exhausted air in some sub∣terraneous tube: the depth of the largest is only 19 feet and a half, the next 17 feet, the next 14, and the least 5 feet and a half. Most of our lime-works, marle-pits, and allum-pits are wrought much deeper than six yards; water standing in hollows, from whence marle has been gotten, will taste pungent on the tongue, curdle milk and soap: we know of no allum being wrought here, though it abounds in Cleveland, not many miles distant, but the use of marle was very early, and it is probable these were marle-pits; they resemble the workings in other counties, where marling is still practised. Marle was known to the Romans, and by them exported hence to foreign countries; we have statues mentioned by our antiquaries, dedicated to <HI>Nehallennia,</HI> or the <HI>new moon,</HI> particularly some inscribed by <HI>Negociator Cretarius Britannicianus,</HI> a dealer in <HI>marle, chalk,</HI> or <HI>fuller's earth,</HI> to the British territories: and these being called <HI>Nehallennia's Kettles,</HI> or of NIE-HEL, in the old German tongue, from the trader's dedication, might be corrupted to or called Hell's Kettles,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Extract of a Letter from Roger Gale, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to Sir John Clerk.—Gale's MSS.</HI>

<P>It was remarked before, that Darlington was situated in an excellent part of the county for a market; every fortnight there is a shew of cattle, and, at the proper season, a shew of sheep and wool, the most abundant of any in the county. Annexed is a table of the average price of long wool for twenty years, the customary stone weight of wool being eighteen pounds, of sixteen ounces to the pound.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">WOOL, 1761, sold at 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> a stone—1762, at 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—1763, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—1764, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—1765, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—1766, at 14 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—1767, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—1768, at 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—1769, at 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—1770, at 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>— 1771, at 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—1772, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—1773, at 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—1774, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—1775, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—1776, at 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> —1777, at 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—1778, at 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—1779, at 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>—1780, at 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—1781, at 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>
<P>The author was indebted for the above account, and much information touching the produce of the country, to that excellent farmer, the late Mr. William Charge, of Cleasby, who received the golden medal and other premiums from the agricultural societies.</P></NOTE> The horned cattle bred on the banks of the Tees, are remarkably beautiful, being of the short-horned kind, and are fed at four and five years old, in a general way, from eighty to ninety stone weight; some are much larger; in 1779, a fat ox, bred by Mr. Thomas Hill, of Blackwell, was killed at Darlington, and sold by a butcher there for 109 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> The beast weighed one hundred and sixty stone ten pounds, at 14 <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> to the stone, of which eleven stone was tallow; he was rising six years old, and measured six feet in stature; was in length nine feet five inches and a half, and over the shoulders two feet ten inches broad; he was in girt before the shoulders nine feet seven inches and a half, behind the shoulders ten feet six inches, and over the loins nine feet six inches and three quarters. Wedder sheep at two years old, bred and fed in this neighbourhood, on an average, weigh from 24 pounds to 30 pounds a quarter, and some advance to the prodigious size of 54 pounds a quarter.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mr. Charge, of Cleasby, and Mr. Culley, of Denton, first introduced, about 12 or 15 years ago, to this part, the Lincolnshire breed of sheep. The Culleys are now great sarmers in Northumberland.</NOTE> The saddle and coach horses bred here are not excelled by those of any other part of the kingdom, and some of the most capital race horses have been pro∣duced in this part of the country. The meadow lands are luxuriant, and excellent corn grows in this and the adjacent parishes; no part of this island possessing a more skilful race of husbandmen, than are settled hereabout.</P>

<P>The manor of EXENHALL is mentioned in Bolden buke, with its services, among which is noted the fourth part of a dringage service, to plough four acres, and sow them and harrow them, the bishop finding seed; making ready four portions of land in autumn, three of them with all the men of his manor, and all his own proper family, except the housewife, and the fourth, and with one man from each house, except his own mansion: to keep dog and horse for a quarter of a year for the chace, carry the prelate's wine with four oxen, and make <HI>vaware,</HI> a term which appears to be explained by Bishop Hatfield's Survey by <HI>outward,</HI> which, it is presumed, related to the chace, and implied an out-watch at the extremities of the chace, it being usual to make a kind of circumvallation, if the term may be allowed, or circle of watchmen, to prevent the game from escaping the bounds: it is still practised in some of the northern counties, where the lords have a boon-hunt; of which an instance is in Martindale, in Cumberland, a chace belonging to the Hasell family. At the time of taking Bishop Hatfield's Survey, this manor belonged to the Lord Nevill, previous to which, we find, it had conferred a local name on the family resident there.</P>
<P>In the way from Darlington to Blackwell, you pass the GRANGE, on an eleva∣ted situation, with a south-east aspect; long eminently distinguished as the feat of Benevolence and the virtues; ostentatious ornaments are not displayed here, rural beauties and simplicity are maintained, as the chief graces of this pleasant place.</P>
<P>The village of BLACKWELL stands on a fine ridge of land, in an elevated situation on the banks of the river Tees, commanding a view of the most fertile flats and meadows on the south-west shore of the river, extending three or four miles, Mr. Hill's house is placed on the point of the hill, in a beautiful station. In Bolden buke, we find that the villain tenants held 47 oxgangs of land here, under the same services as the villains of Darlington. Amongst others, Adam, the son of Ralph de Stapilton, held four oxgangs; was overseer of those who prepared the portion land, and served on the bishop's embassies. He held Bathela,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A corruption of Battle-law.</NOTE> before named. Ten cottagers were under the like services as those before mentioned. In Bishop Bury's time, a family assumed the local name.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. Radulphus de Blackwell. 8th Bishop Bury cor. vic. in plen. com. Dum.

Among the lands which he held, is a plot called the <HI>Castle-Hill,</HI> with the herbage of Bathley. The ground called Castle-Hill is situated in front of Mr. Hill's house; but there is no other tra∣dition of a castle, nor any remains of a fortification near Blackwell. By this survey, it appears there were twenty villain tenants here, who were under the same services as those at Darlington, only for five additional oxgangs of land they paid x quar∣ters of meal, v quarters of barley, and x quarters of oats. There were six cottagers, and several tenants on Exchequer lands, which, it is apprehended, were new improvements, and paid full rents to the Exchequer. Wodsilver is mentioned, among the payments made by tenants of the vill, in general. The two great
<PB N="194" REF="254"/>families of Eure and Nevill had in later times the chief possessions here, Blackwell lands being named among the forfeited estates of Charles Earl of Westmorland.</P>
<P>COCKERTON lies about a mile to the north-west of Darlington, in a low situa∣tion, and was one of the places given by Styr to St. Cuthbert, along with Darlington. In Bolden buke it is noted, that the villains held forty-seven oxgangs of land under the like services as those of Darlington. In Bishop Bury's time, Thomas, the son of Jollanus de Morton, held, by the courtesy of England, a messuage and four oxgangs of lands there, by homage, fealty, and a certain rent paid to the bishop's exchequer; he also held two burgages in Darlington, doing suit at the tollbooth there, and rendering eight pounds of wax for the lights of the church. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, we find the same family of Mortons here, with Gilfrid Kellawe and John Dawe as free-tenants: it appears thereby, that there were nineteen villain tenants; and others, who were at penny ferme,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib.

<P>Of Archdeacon Newton, nothing occurs worth noting.</P>
<P>In the year 1767, a navigable canal was projected, to lead through this part of the county, from Stockton up to Winston, with various side cuts, from Darlington to Croftbridge, from Thornton to Piersbridge, and from Cotham Stob to Yarm; the length of the canal was calculated at thirty-three miles, sour furlongs, nine chains, and forty-two links: the whole fall in that distance 328 feet: the expence of the projected work was estimated by Brindley and Whitworth, including the purchase of lands, at 63,722 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Estimates were made of the carriage of merchandize and the products of the country, which greatly flattered the scheme; but some influence gave a damp to a project which would have enriched future generations, and given great importance to those parts, the produce of which is now, either greatly shut up from foreign markets, or loaded with a burthen of land carriage, which denies its equality with that of other parts of the country.</P>
<P>The following extracts from the tables, exhibited in support of the proposed navigation, will shew the importance of this part of the county. Coals won at the coaleries at Etherly, West Auckland, Cockfield, Norwood, Butterknowle, Brusseltons, Eldon, and Bishop Auckland, in one year, 101,700 tons.</P>

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF AYCLIFFE.</HEAD>
<P>TO the north of Darlington, lies the parish of Aycliffe. There are two villages of the name of Aycliffe, viz Great Aycliffe, and School Aycliffe, the latter of which is in the parish of Heighington; they were part of the ancient possessi∣ons of the see of Lindisfarn, which Simeon says, were assigned by Bishop Aldune to the Earls of Northumberland, towards supporting the wars of those times, and were not, for several ages, restored to the church. Canute, when he perform∣ed
<PB N="197" REF="257"/>his pilgrimage from Garmundsway to St. Cuthbert's shrine, by some writers it is said, granted Aycliffes to the church, with divers other possessions. Other authorities attribute the gift to Scot, the son of Elstane.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Scot Elstani filius pro animae suae redemptione consentientibus sibi filiis, omnibusq. amicis, acleam cum suis appendiciis tribuit quod ego (W. de Karilepho) addita quadam villa nomine cattun amplificavi; unum illius partem a maldreda data sibi villa winleoctun cambiendo aliam vero ad Edmundo Elstani filio pecunia emendo.

The nave has side ailes, is 20 paces in length and 12 in width; the tower is about 85 feet high, and rises on four pointed arches, supported to the east on heavy clustered pillars, and pilasters in the west wall. The south aile is formed by two round pillars, supporting three light pointed arches. In the yard, on the south side of the church, lies a colossian effigy in stone, with hands elevated; a shield on the left arm, without any armo∣rial device; the sword sheathed: the legs crossed, the right leg uppermost, the feet resting on a dog; the personage represented, unknown.</P>

<P>Heworth is named in the Bolden Buke, as being in the tenure of Gilbertus, for three marks, on payment of which he was discharged from all the ancient services, which were due in Thanage, similar to Ricken-hall. By Hatfield's Survey, it ap∣pears, that Heworth was the property of William Brus, who then held the vill by foreign service, and 15 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent. The inquisition taken on his death, states, that he held the manor by a quarter part of a knight's fee. In the 34th year of the same prelate, an inquisition taken on the death of William, the heir of the last mentioned Brus, states, that 18 years before, by licence, he had enfeoffed John Lankryff and others, and after re-entered and enfeoffed Thomas Wright, of a messuage and four oxgangs of land for life; that Lankryff took nothing by the feoffment, but William died seized of the manor, leaving William, his son and heir, of the age of six years; this family continued long in possession. In the 23d of Bishop Langley, by an inquisition then taken, it appears that William Brus had conveyed part of the manor to William Smythe of Heworth, by way of term.<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

<P>There is much uncertainty, touching Grindon, in the records: it appears that it was a manor of the Redhoughs, and that Thomas del Redhough, granted the same to John de Morden for ever; rendering a rose the first year, and ten marks yearly for ever thereafter to his heirs: and that it was held by Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, by homage and fealty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

<P>Ricknall is noted in the Bolden Buke, to have twelve villains, each of whom held one oxgang of land, of nine acres, for which they wrought three days in the week, between St. Peter's day and Martinmas, and the rest of the year two days in the week; that they each tilled four portions of land for winter-sowing, and rendered two hens and 20 eggs. The demesnes, with the stock of sheep, were in the possession of the Bishop. Bishop Hatfield's Survey, states, that there were 12 oxgangs of land, containing xx acres each. William Tedy of Ocley, held the whole vill with the aforementioned work, and other privileges, at one hundred shillings and sixpence rent. John del Loge, held the Grange in farm, with the demesne lands, containing four carucates; each carucate, eight oxgangs, and each oxgang, 20 acres, at 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> rent.</P>
<P>Of Copelaw, nothing singular is noted in the records.</P>
<P>Brafferton, in the Bolden Buke, is said to render 24 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 ½ <ABBR>d.</ABBR> for cornage, one milch cow, one castleman, and five chalders of barley, the like of meal and of oats. The thane attended the chace with two greyhounds and five cords, and fol∣lowed the court, but did not feed dog nor horse. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, the quantities of rent sec, or dry rents, are set out under the head of <HI>pro bladis de scat,</HI> which should be read <HI>seacc,</HI> and illustrates a former observation, that <HI>scat,</HI> in the ancient records, implies allotted quantities of grain, &amp;c. payable, or account∣able at the bishop's exchequer; the Bolden Buke called the allotment of meal, &amp;c. a chalder; here it is stiled seven bushels.</P>
<P>The family of Chauncellor had two messuages and one hundred acres of land here in the time of Bishop Hatfield, held of the bishop in capite<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ing. p. m. Johan, vid.

And in the 23d of that prelate, Thomas de Brafferton, sick in the time of the pestilence, conveyed to trustees, two messuages and eight acres of land, with intent to enfeoff Thomas, his son, then in minority, which was deemed collusive, as depriving the bishop of his custody of the premises and wardship of the heir. It appears by an inqui∣sition, taken on Thomas's death,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ao. 34 Hatfield.</NOTE> that he held sundry other lands, for which he paid 18 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> at the bishop's exchequer; at the manor-house of Coundon 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and at the manor-house at Auckland, three bushels and a half of meal, three and a half of malt, and seven bushels of oats.

<P>Woodham, which takes its name from Wuddell-tun, was one of the manors resigned by Aldun to the Earls of Northumberland. When it was restored to the see, or was granted to the priory, doth not appear, without it passed as a member, and under the general description of Aycliffe; and that seems probable, by the language of the grant from Richard, prior of Durham, to Thomas de Whitworth, (transcribed into the register book of the parish church) of the manor of Wood∣ham, by metes and bounds: which of the Richards it was, is difficult to ascertain: Richard de Claxton was elected in 1273, and resigned in 1285; and Richard de Hoton was elected in 1289, and died in 1308. In Bishop Bury's time, Alexander de Whitworth died seized of this manor, leaving Thomas, his son and heir.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

<PB N="202" REF="262"/>extensive view over the borders of Cleveland, and the Yorkshire vale, terminated by Hamilton and Cleveland hills; you trace the shores of the river Tees, down to its aestuary, and command a distant sea prospect. The chancel of the church is five paces in length within the altar rails; from whence, descending by three steps, it is eight paces to the nave; in width five paces, and is stalled with oak. The nave, entered by a circular arch, springing from pilasters, is 16 paces in
<PB N="203" REF="263"/>length, and 12 in width, having one aile on the south side, formed by two octagonal pillars, supporting pointed arches. The church is crowded with heavy galleries to the west and north. Round the mouldings of the pulpit, in the old black letter, cut in wood, is the following sentence: <HI>orate p'aibs Al****dri Flettchar et Agnetis uxor ejus.</HI></P>
<P>In the Bolden Buke, it is noted that 16 villains, held each two oxgangs of land in Hieghington, and rendered ten chalders of malt, the like of meal and of oats, and 64 chalders of aver-malt, of the accustomed measure of Heighington-hall; carried eight carriage loads of woodlades, and rendered 32 hens, 1000 eggs, 36 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for cornage, one milch cow, and one castleman. There were two cottagers, each holding 15 acres, for which they wrought two days in every week throughout the year, and joined with the villains in their scats, or exchequer dues, their reaping and yeulwaiting. Three other cottagers held each four acres, and wrought, from St. Peter's day to Martinmas, two days in the week, and the rest of the year, one day in the week. The villains and cottagers dressed all the growing corn of the vill, and provided each week in autumn for each oxgang of land, one man to reap, and prepared four portions of land, with their whole family, except the housewives, when they were intitled to a corrody. Every villain ploughed and harrowed half an acre for oats; and for every carucate of land, they ploughed and harrowed an acre, and had their corrody: and they made one portion, one day, with all the harrows of the town. The sixteen villains rendered 16 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for michelmet, and 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for yeulwaiting.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The payment for the <HI>michelmet,</HI> was for the charges of the Michaelmas court, or mote of the ma∣nor. The yeulwaiting, was the watch, or <HI>waits,</HI> as they are still called in the city of Durham, and other parts of the county, who parade the streets with music. Most of the ancient church customs were derived from the heathens, and this in particular; for when the sun approached to its winter period, or solstice, they devised the fable, that Typhon, or the evil spirit of darkness, was contending with the God of day, and that his legious were dispersed over the earth, to carry mischiefs to mankind; therefore, to repel their malignity, or drive them from the habitations of man, music was used, and sires lighted: after Christianity was received, this old custom was retained; to please those, whose minds superstition and an∣cient practices had prejudiced, and the waits or musical watch, and yeul-sires, were continued, only ap∣plying them to the birth of our Saviour, the Sun of Righteousness, instead of the former ridiculous fable.</NOTE> Simon Hostion held sixty acres, and rendered a hawk. Thomas Clerk held four oxgangs of land for half a mark, made three portions, and served on embassies. Thomas de Penie held other lands. Heighington mill paid 12 marks. The punder had six acres and his thraves, and rendered four∣score hens, and five hundred eggs. The demesne lands were in farm. All the villains of Hieghington served in winning and leading the lord's hay, and inclosed and fenced in the court and the <HI>virgultum:</HI> they also carried the lord's corn where he ordered, between Tyne and Tees; and each provided one cord at the great chase, and the bishop himself provided, from Heighington-hall, 15 cords. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, the free tenants are named with their services. Richard Scroope, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> held lands, called the Brakes, containing 100 acres, without rent. The free tenants, and those who held tofts, paid 4 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> cornage in September. The services of the bond tenants, are thereby stipulated to be similar to those of Killer∣by; the services specified, are much the same as those noted in the Bolden Buke. In the valor of the manor, the manor is described to consist of one manor-house,
<PB N="204" REF="264"/>with two oxgangs of land, and two grainges, one curtilage, 28 oxgangs of land, each containing 15 acres, and eight acres of meadow; the whole value, x <ABBR>l.</ABBR> xiii <ABBR>s.</ABBR> iiii <ABBR>d.</ABBR></P>
<P>By the inquisitions post mortem, we find sundry persons held parcels of land in Heighington in capite, viz. John de Heighington, died seized of lands there in the fourth year of Bishop Bury. Walter Wyot, in the fifth year of Bishop Hatfield: he also held lands of Richard Scroope. Alicia, Isabel, and Margaret, daughters of John, the son of Gilbert de Fery, and Eleanor, the widow of William Coke, in the same year of that prelate. Cecilia, the widow of John de Evenwood in the eleventh year, John Hunter in the 18th, Thomas de Hexam in the 31st of the same prelate. William Delwell, in the 1st year of Bishop Skirlaw, Roger Gelett, in the 5th, and William Delnorth, in the 10th year of that prelate; the latter held by military service, suit of court, 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> annual rent, 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> cornage, 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> common aids which should run in the bishoprick of Durham, and service on the bishop's em∣bassies when need required.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. x° Skirlaw.</NOTE> Several of those tenements are to be traced into vari∣ous descents, but being small, are not of sufficient consequence to claim the reader's attention. The possession of the family of Scroopes there, appears to be principally a pasture, containing 22 acres, called Freemenbrekes. It is to be observed, the servile tenures of Heighington were remarkably burthensome, and the poor wretches who held the lands, were in a vassalage, which at this day appears into∣lerable to us who enjoy the blessings of liberty. How much do we owe to the illustrious personages, who procured that exalted felicity in the last century, amidst the corruptions of a licentious reign, and the vices of a dissipated age.</P>
<P>In the 43d year of Queen Elizabeth, Elizabeth Jennison of Walworth, widow of Thomas Jennison, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> founded a school here; to the advancement of which, Edward Kirkley, vicar, afterwards gave 70 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> She endowed the school with an annual stipend of 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> part of a rent charge, of 11 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> issuing out of lands in Bishop Middleham. The articles and ordinances, declare that the school shall be free for the children of all the inhabitants of the parish, and those born or kept therein; the free scho∣lars to pay 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> entrance, and twopence a-quarter. The master is to teach from Lilly's Accidence and Grammar, Cato, Aesop's Fables, Terence, Ovid's Metamor∣phoses, Virgil, Tully's Offices, Tully's Familiar Epistles, the Greek Grammar, Greek Testament, and Isocrates, and such other books as the bishop, or during the vacancy of the see, the dean and chapter should direct. At spare times, to teach writing and accompts. The master not to be absent above 20 days in one whole year, without licence from the bishop, or dean and chapter, in a vacancy of the see. The election of school-master, after the Jennisons therein named, to be in the dean and chapter, and on their default by two months, the bishop to have the nomination, or his chancellor, during a vacancy of the see. The ordinances for their preservation, and that they may be publicly known, were directed to be writ∣ten in a book, to be kept by the church-wardens of the parish.</P>
<P>June 15th, 1567, Queen Elizabeth, by her letters patent, granted lands at Heighington, to endow the free grammar school of Darlington.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Darlington.</NOTE> A survey was taken of them in 1752.</P>
<P>About a mile to the west of the town of Heighington, is a remarkable mount, called Shackleton, on which Crosier Surtees, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> has built a pleasure house. It
<PB N="205" REF="265"/>is wound round with three distinct terraces, and is thought to be the remains of a Danish fort; the mount bearing an exact similitude to those in the more northern parts of this island, where the Danes were stationed for many years. It is the only monument we have observed of that people, between Tyne and Tees. Mr. Surtees has planted the ground, and otherwise altered it in form, that the dimen∣sions could not be accurately obtained on our view.</P>
<P>There is an extensive prospect from this mount, up the river Tees, and towards Raby, Staindrop, and Auckland, as well as to the southward; the situation was well chosen for the station of a detachment for observation.</P>

Three cottagers held xii acres, and wrought two days in every week, between St. Peter's day and Martinmas, and the rest of the year one day in each week. Guido de Redworth held the new vill of Thickley, in exchange for Redworth, render∣ing one mark, and providing 12 men one day, or one man 12 days in autumn, and to reap and plough one day, to work at the mill-dam, serve on embassies, and carry the lord's wine with four oxen. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, the tenants are stiled dringes. It appears therein, that several parcels of the lands, held by them, had been escheats to the lord, and granted out. John de Heighington, held in capite the bishop lands in Redworth, in the 6th year of Bishop Bury.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

One cottager held his tenement by the service of six days work in autumn. The demesne lands of Midridge and Thickley, with the improvements, together with the pastures of Salkesdown and Redworth, and the sheep-stock, were in the bishop's hands. By Hatfield's Survey, we have little more information of the ancient tenures of this place, than in the preceding record; in the duties of the bond tenants, we see specified the <HI>blad. de scat,</HI> or allotted payments in corn, or exchequer corn, to
<PB N="207" REF="267"/>consist of wheat or rye, oats and malt, and they were to perform their labour, to plough, harrow, dress or weed, and work at hay, as those of Heighington, according to the ancient custom. Thickley was one of the places resigned to the Earls of Northumberland, and was restored by Canute to the see.</P>
<P>NEWBIGGIN, in the same survey, is called the Newvill, near Thickley, then held by John Nottingham, at 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent, and under the services before specified, to be performed for the same by Guido de Redworth, in the Bolden Buke. Henry Stainsby held lands of a new assart; and William de Heighington held a part of Newbiggin Moor, formerly finans, the son of Roger.</P>
<P>By the Bolden Buke, it appears there were fifteen villains in Midridge, each of whom held two oxgangs of land, rendering eight chalders of malt, the like of meal and of oats, and sixty chalders of aver-malt, of the hall measure, seven loads and a half of woodlades, thirty hens, three marks for cornage, one milch-cow, one castleman, 15 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for michelmet, and five shillings yeulwaiting; and they performed their labour like the villains of Heighington. Ulkillus held a cottage, with one oxgang of land, wrought two days in the week throughout the year, and contri∣buted with the villains to the <HI>scat.</HI> Three other cottagers held each four acres, and laboured like those of Heighington. Verkman and Anketillus held lands on certain services. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, there are few alterations in the services worthy notice. Thomas de Heighington, Adam del Stanes, and Roger Fulthorpe, are named as free tenants. The manor house is mentioned, with a lodge for the bailiff, and twenty-one oxgangs of arable land, containing in the whole 305 acres, 113 acres of mowing land, with several pasture grounds, the whole yearly value, 28 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 5 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> A piece of wood-land, called Drythop, was claimed by William de Lilburn, who refused to permit the bishop's tenants to depasture therein. The Grainge was let to farm to William Hunter, at 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent. This Grainge was afterwards the seat of the family of Byerleys. The town of Midridge is in the parish of St. Andrew Auckland.</P>
<P>SCHOOL AYCLIFFE is mentioned in the Bolden Buke, as rendering to the bishop two marks: and, in Hatfield's Survey, is said to be under a free-rent for foreign service, of 26 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> The first person named in the inquisitions <HI>post mortem,</HI> is John de Scholacley, in the fifth of Bishop Hatfield; and the family assuming that local name possessed lands there, for several generations, holding the same of the bishop in capite, by homage and fealty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

<P>Of COATSAY MOOR, the records contain nothing worthy observation: a family of Wilkinsons are now resident there.</P>
<P>HIGH WALWORTH, a beautiful seat, the property of John Harrison, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> situated about a mile distant from Heighington, of a southern aspect, and com∣manding an extensive prospect on the banks of the Tees; having seven hundred and two acres of excellent land annexed to it. This was anciently a seat of the Nevills; and whilst they possessed such an extensive territory as the honours of Barnard Castle and Raby, where they exercised a special jurisdiction and franchise, it can be no matter of surprise, that we so seldom find their estates in this part of the country, noted in the records of our prelates. Walworth passed to Gilbert Hansard, Knight, and his heirs, by marriage of one of the daughters of Ralph Lord Nevill. It continued in that family for several generations; and at length became the possession of the Ayscoughs, of the county of Lincoln, by marriage of the only daughter and heiress of Sir William Hansard, Knight, and from them it came to the Jennisons, by purchase; by the branching out of the family of Jennisons, the original estate of Walworth was divided, the one part taking the name of High Walworth; the other of Low Walworth; which latter, it is to be observed, is one of the registered estates before noted, then the property of John Jennison, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and valued at 262 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year. Of this branch, there are descendants, Augustine, a monk; Francis, heretofore in the English army an officer of dragoons, now a Count of the holy Roman empire, and chamberlain to his serene highness the Elector Palatine and Bavaria, and resides at Heidelberg; and another brother an ecclesiastic. High Walworth, whilst the estate of Thomas Jennison, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who was auditor general to Queen Elizabeth, and was the first of that name who resided there, received great improvements; he erected the mansion house from out of a heap of ruins; the south front is in the high stile of that aera, flanked with circular turrets: the windows decorated with fine painted glass, exhibiting the arms of many great personages, his cotemporaries. Ralph Jennison, who was master of the stag-hounds to the late king, was the last of that race, who was proprietor of High Walworth; his widow sold the estate about the year 1759, to Matthew Stephenson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> son of John Stephenson, wine merchant, and Alderman of Newcastle upon Tyne, for 16000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> who soon afterwards sold it to Mr. Harrison, the present owner.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Sinews granted Walworth to Richard Bellasis, in the minority of Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of William Hansard, son and heir of Sir William Hansard. <HI>Cursit. Rolls Rudd's MSS.</HI>—In the 9th of Bishop Tunstall, Francis Askew, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> had livery of Walworth, in right of Elizabeth his wife, daughter and heiress of William Hansard. <HI>Ibid MSS.</HI>
<P>In the 2d of Bishop Barnes, a pardon was obtained for the alienation of Walworth, by William Askew, and Ann his wife. to Thomas Jennison, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> 20th Sept. Ao. 2d ep. <HI>Ibid MSS.</HI></P>
<P N="31">31st James I. 1615, a settlement was made of the manor of Walworth, to the use of Rob. Jennison for life, remainder to his first and other sons in tail-male (Robert was the eldest son of William Jenuison) Remainder to the second and all others the sons of William, in tail-male. Remainder to John Jennison for life. Remainder to his first and other sons successively, in tail-male, with divers remainders over. <HI>Ibid MSS.</HI></P>
<P>The author received the following account of the Jennisons, from Francis before named, who now subscribes himself Jennison Walworth, dated Heidelberg, in Germany, 20th Nov. 1792. Thomas Jennison, who lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was also lord of the manor of Carlbury and Woodham This gentleman inherited drom his ancestor Thomas Jennison, who lived in the time of King Henry VI Yokeflect, Guen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke, and Bennetland, in the county of York, Winterton, in Lincolnshire, Burnham Westgate, Burnham Norton, Burnham Ulp, Burnham St. Andrew, Burnham St Edmund, and Depedale, in the county of Norfolk, as appears from the records of the Herald's Office, and the family deeds. Thomas settled at Walworth, and by his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Birch, of Sandon, in the county of Bedford, left many children, from whom descended several of that name; viz Sir Matthew Jennison, of Newark upon Trent; Sir Ralph, of Elswick, in Northumberland; but none of those branches left issue. Walworth remained in the family undevised, till the time of John Jennison, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who died 2d March, 1680. He married to his first wife, Catharine, daughter of William Ironmonger, of Eccleshall, in Staffordshire, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> by whom he had issue Robert, Thomas, and Catharine, who all died unmarried. His second wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Pierson, of Newcastle upon Tyne, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and by her he had Joseph, who died an infant, John, who succeeded to a part of Walworth, and several other children. After their father, Robert, the eldest son, claimed the whole of the estate; by a decree in Chancery, it was divided; Robert had High Walworth, with the mansion house, and John had Low Walworth, with the jointer house built for his mother. Ralph Jennison, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a lineal descendant, obtained power to sell for payment of debts, by an act of parliament; by virtue of which, the estate of High Walworth was sold as before mentioned.—Francis before mentioned, the descendant of John, sold Low Walworth, and went to the continent.</P></NOTE></P>

By the Bolden Buke, it appears there were anciently twelve villains, each of whom held two oxgangs of land, and that they rendered eight chalders and a half of malt, the like of meal and of oats, and forty-eight chalders of aver-malt, of the measure of Heighington-Hall; they made six loads of woodlades, rendered twenty-four hens, 36 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> for cornage, one milch-cow, one castleman, 12 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for michelmet, and 4 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for yeulwaiting; and performed equal work with those of Heighington. Two cottagers wrought six days in autumn, and Simon Hostiarius held a carucate of free land, by the twelfth part of a knight's fee. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, it is set forth, that John Killerby held Simon's lands, being sixty-one acres, and there were two other free tenants. The services of the bond tenants and cottagers are more distinctly specified and set forth, together with the occasions which intitled them to the corrody; they were obliged to carry for the bishop, three loads between Tyne and Tees, and as often as his pleasure was, to carry between Tees and Were; and each tenant was to provide one cord at the bishop's great chace.</P>

The nave is twenty-four paces in length, has an aile to
<PB N="212" REF="272"/>the north, and by the appearance of the south wall, it seems there was formerly an aile on that side. The north aile is formed by four round pillars, not above five feet in height, with ancient Saxon capitals, supporting pointed arches, which denotes a modern reparation; the whole width of the nave is nine paces: there are four irregular windows to the south, and three to the north. A monument of the family of Bowes, of Thornton, richly ornamented, and placed against the north wall, is mouldering away by the dampness.</P>
<P>By the Red Book, and other ancient authorities in the church records, it appears that Conscliff was very early given to the see by Snaculf, the son of Cykell; other authorities say, lands in Conscliff were given by Styr, the son of Ulphus, to

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF GAINFORD.</HEAD>
<P>WE entered this parish at PIERSBRIDGE, a village on the banks of the river Tees, over which is a stone bridge of three arches. The village stands on the margin of a rich vale, and on the site of a Roman station; the remains of the north and west sides of the vallum, and part of the south line, are very conspicu∣ous; the houses are built a little way within the mound, and in the same direction. The Roman road passed a few paces to the east of the station, extending in a line with the present way from Legscross, towards Cathrick: an ancient bridge over the river lay in this direction; the timbers, piles, or framings of the foundation were visible till the great flood in November, 1771, when they were torn up and washed away: the present stone bridge now stands 260 paces higher up the river. Mr. Horsley,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Brit. Rom. p. 486.</NOTE> speaking of Piersbridge, says— <Q>This place has been a considerable “Roman station. A large number of coins have been found here (several of which are now in my possession) an aqueduct, if I am not mistaken, has gone just thro' the present town,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The brook supplied the ditch of the fortress with water, and also the garrison by an aqueduct, firmly arched at the top, so as to bear the public road, till 1730, when some coal draughts penetrated through it, discovering the cavity above a yard wide, and a yard and a quarter deep.
<P>Dr. HUNTER'S NOTES, MSS.</P></NOTE> and the foundations of houses every where appear, especially when the earth is any where opened, or even well watered with rain, and after a shower, the coins are also discovered, and gathered up in abundance. A large stone coffin was also found here, and other antiquities. The last time I viewed the place, I was inclined to think, that a sort of garden, with some trees in it, which I once imagined might be inclosed in part with some of the ramparts of the station, has rather been the Praetorium only. This station and town are on the north side of the Tees, but there is another rivulet on the north side of the station, so that it has had the usual situation on a lingula between a greater and a smaller river, and near their confluence; yet there is high ground both to
<PB N="215" REF="275"/>the north and south of the station. As I went from Durham to Piersbridge, I saw two seeming tumuli, one a mile from the town on the left, the other near the ”entrance to the town, on the right.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The military way from Binchester to this place is very visible, especially near Piersbridge, my landlord called it the broad-way, he also told me of a bridge, some of the wood of which was yet remaining; there was an elevation very visible beyond this bridge, (which was over the rivulet) but I took this to be rather the continuance of the military way, than any part of the ramparts of the station. The way points directly to the tofts, the field in which the station has probably been, and from whence the coins have the name of toft-pieces. The houses which stand here are called the Bury, or Carle-bury, perhaps it has been Castle-bury: I therefore take Piersbridge to be Magae in the Notitia. Dr. Gale supposes this to be the same with Magna in the Itinerary, which he places at Old Radnor; but ”this is vastly too far to the south, if we observe the order in the Notitia.</Q> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the Latin Edition of Camden, 1594, this place is not noted.
<P>Brit. Rom. p. 296. <HI>Dis manibus. Condati Antonius Quintianus—ex jussu susceptum solvit libenti animo.</HI></P>
<P>This stone was found near Piersbridge, not far from Wathing-street; it has been published by Mr. Thoresby; as also in the last editions of Camden, and is inserted by Dr. Gale in his Antonini Itinerarium. It is a funeral monument erected to one Condatus, in the usual tenor of such inscriptions; I wonder, therefore, that not only Mr. Thoresby, but also the learned and judicious Dr. Gale, should take it for the name of a place, which does not use to be inserted in this kind of inscriptions, and that they should suspect it to be the Condate in the Itinerary, which by all circumstances, appears to be in Cheshire. As <HI>Condatus</HI> is the name of the deceased, so Antonius Quintianus are two names of the person who erected the altar, and I suppose MEN to be a third name of the same person. The line in the base, I have ventured to read <HI>ex jussu susceptum solvit libenti animo,</HI> because it was common for them to pretend, that they took a vow upon them by the command or order of some deity. Parallel instances of this kind may be seen in many collections. Mr. Ward reads the letters, <HI>Ex. cc. imp. Ex charissima conjugis impensa,</HI> and so refers <HI>ex jussu susceptum</HI> on the base, to the order of the widow, who not being present, desired this Quintianus, a friend or relation of her deceased husband, to erect this monument at her expence. In Manutius C C. stands for <HI>charissima conjux,</HI> but if any think them put for <HI>contubernalium</HI> here, the sense will not be incongruous. Kennet has <HI>contubernales imperatoris,</HI> but he produces no authority for it, and I think it is without probability. It was not uncommon for them to erect sepulchral monuments and altars, near a river, and a military way, though it might not be very near to a station; so that it is not necessary, barely upon this account, to suppose there has been a station, either at or near the place where this altar was found, for other evidences put it out of doubt that there was, as is shewn above.</P></NOTE> Dr. Gibson supposes this place to have been originally called Priestbridge, either from two neigbouring priests, who built a bridge of stone over the river here, instead of a wooden bridge which they found there; or from some priests who were appointed to officiate in a chapel, the ruins of which are still to be seen near the bridge. In Leland's Itinerary, vol. I. p. 74, this place is noted— <Q>Persebridge, “sumtime of five arches, but a late made new of three arches. There is a prati chapel of our lady, hard by Persebridge, of the foundation of John Balliol, King ”of Scottes.</Q> This chapel, of which there are some remains, was called St. Mary's, but we know little further concerning it;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Copied by Dr. Hunter from an old MS. wrote since the dissolution, but without a date.</HI>
<P>In St. Mary's chapel was a chauntry, which had 2 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> salary annexed to it: for the which, every farm in this town, Langton, and Headlam, presented a petition to Trinity College, Cambridge, as being of old erected, though now ruined, to excuse them from going to their parish church at Gainford. The whole sum annually collected, and called chauntry money, amounts to 8 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> A load of wheat was first proposed by the inhabitants, then the sum of money above, paid in lieu, for the service of their chapel. This collection was, about 30 years ago, unpaid during the term of three years. Twenty-two years ago, a stranger from York, demanded the money upon the inhabitants, when, particularly George Hobson, desiring to know by what authority he asked it, he refused to shew any, but threatened them with an exchequer writ; they, frightened at this, were forced to comply.</P>
<P>MR. ALLAN'S COLLECTIONS.</P></NOTE> it was more ancient than the
<PB N="216" REF="276"/>present bridge, and, we presume, was founded for the proper use of the inhabitants of Piersbridge, and not for mendicants, who sought alms of passengers. In the beginning of the 15th century, it is probable there was no bridge over the Tees, but at Piersbridge, and we find there was a chapel, dedicated to St. John the Bap∣tist, on <HI>Tees bridge.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Faustina A.

<P>The foregoing conjectures, as to the etymology of the name of this place, are left to the reader; to which we may add, that it might derive its name from a bridge erected on Piers, or that it was called Priest-bridge, at once, from its being the approach to this ecclesiastical territory, and the place established by ancient custom for the holders of Sockburn manor to deliver a faulchion to the Bishop of Durham, on his first coming into his Palatinate. Mr. Horsley confounds the names of Carlebury and Piersbridge, as if appertaining to the same ground; whereas Carlebury lies on the other side of the brook: Carle is a word of northern acceptation, and probably the tumulus mentioned above gave name to the ground, as being the place of interment of some carle or chieftan. Besides the remains noted by Mr. Horsley, a multitude of coins of the Lower Empire have been found here, of which many are in Mr. Allan's collection, together with a small and elegant brass busto.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">In the last volume of the Archaeologia, is engraven a small brass figure of Mercury, communicated by Mr. Cade, said to be found here.</NOTE> In the year 1749, a fragment of a Roman inscription was dug up at Carlebury, transcribed by Dr. Hunter, but so mutilated as to afford no reading.</P>
<P>Piersbridge was one of the twenty-four villas consigned by Bishop Aldune to the Earl of Northumberland, as an aid towards prosecuting the war, and never re∣stored to the church. It is now a member of the honour of Castle Barnard, and was part of the ancient estate of the Baliols.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bishop's writt, grounded on the king's writt, to detain Anthony Brackenbury, his bailiss of Gainford, Piersbridge, Headlam, and Langton, within that lordship, and to collect from Gainforth.

Colonel Howard was killed, with many of lower rank: some human bones were found, when the turnpike road to Legs-Cross was cast up, presumed to belong to those who were slain on that occasion.</P>
<P>The CHAPELRY of DENTON lies to the north-east of Piersbridge, and compre∣hends the townships of Denton and Haughton-le-Side. Denton and Haughton are members of the honour of Castle Barnard. Denton is situated in a valley, watered by a small brook which runs through it.—Those who have sought after distant etymologies, have conceived this was once a settlement of the Danes, from whom it derived its name; but perhaps it was so called from the dean or valley in which it stands. This was once a considerable town, as the remains and vestigia of houses denote, but it is now reduced to a small village. There is a tradition, that Denton, Ulmaby, Carlebury, Walworth, Haughton-le-Side, Shackerton, New∣biggin, and other villages in this district, were burned on an incursion of the Scots; and it is probable Malcolm took his route down this track, when he came by Hunderthwaite, and penetrated as far as Cleveland. William the Norman laid waste the country between York and Durham; but, it is presumed, he only marked the progress of his army by those devastations, and did not spread destruction over all the adjacent lands: the ford at Nesham was then the usual summer passage out of Yorkshire into the palatinate.</P>
<P>Denton was part of the possessions of the Earls of Westmorland, but being granted out on reserved rents, was not included in the forfeiture which swept their large estates into the hands of the crown. In the reign of King Henry VI. whilst Bishop Nevill held the see, by an inquisition taken on the death of Johan, Countess of Westmorland, it appears Thomas Tailbois held a large estate in Denton of the Earl of Warwick.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

<P>The vale in which Piersbridge stands, produces the finest barley. There are great lime-works at Carlebury, which supply a large tract of country. The prospects on the road as the traveller advances to Gainford, are narrow, but various and beautiful; the Yorkshire banks of the river rise more lofty than those on the Durham side, but both consist of grounds highly cultivated. Opposite to Piers-bridge, on the Yorkshire side, covered with a thick grove, stands Cliff, the seat of the Withams, taking its name from the situation. On the Durham side, a little further west, on a fine declivity, and within an agreeable distance of the river, is Snow-hall, formerly the estate of the Rains, now of Doctor Sherwood. To the north of the turnpike road, stands Grayston-hall, detached of late years from the Snow-hall estate, and now the property of the Elliots. Advancing a little further, a view opens upon the village of Gainford, seated in a most delightful valley, through which the river winds beautifully. There are steep and broken cliffs on the Yorkshire side, skirted and crowned with scattered groves. The opposite lands consist of fine meadows, hanging with an easy declivity towards the river. The village, which contains many handsome houses, forms a square, with a green in the centre:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here lived in the decline of life, and died, that great artist, Mr. William Stephens: one of the first engravers of the age, for imitating records and ancient inscriptions.</NOTE> the vicarage house stands on the south side, with excellent gardens hanging on the brink of the river. Comparison is frequently made between Gainford and Hurworth, as to the beauty of their situations; but they are wholly dissimilar, the one being on an elevated brow, and the other in a sequestered vale.</P>
<P>Gainford is of great antiquity: the first church was built by Egred, otherwise called Egfrid, Bishop of Lindisfarn, and given by him to the see, with the vills of
<PB N="220" REF="280"/>Gainford, Cliff, and Wycliff. About the year 828,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ang. Sac. vol. i. p. 698. Vol. i. of this work, p. 49.</NOTE> Gainford was one of the 24 vills or townships resigned to the Earls of Northumberland to support the wars, and never afterwards restored to the church:<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. i.</NOTE> it was a seigniory, endowed with special liberties, detached from the Palatine jurisdiction, and within the wapen∣take of Sadberg; so that we find no ancient records relative to it in the rolls of the bishop's chancery: we are ignorant of the possessors, till the time of Edward I. when under the statute of <HI>quo warranto,</HI> an inquiry was taken in the year 1293, of the lands and liberties within the bishoprick of Durham, under which it is stated, that Agnes de Valencia had free warren in her lands at Gainford, where she had her place of execution, and power of infangtheof; with the goods of felons, and other privileges of a royal franchise. Gainford became the estate of the Baliols, by Hugh's marrying Agnes de Valencia, and being part of the possessions of John Baliol, was included in the forfeitures of that unfortunate prince. Under that event, large possessions devolved on the see of Durham, but the king having enter∣tained a great displeasure at Bishop Beck, seized Gainford, and gave it to Guido de Bello Campo, Earl of Warwick, to hold in capite of the crown. It was then a member of the honour of Castle Barnard, which passed by the same forfeiture, and was included in the same grant. King Edward II. did not reverse the grant, or make restitution to the church; and it was not till the time of-Bishop Lewis Beaumont, in the 1 st year of King Edward III. that the forfeited estates were yielded to the see after judgment obtained in parliament.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vide vol. i.</NOTE> By the process it is stated, that the Earl of Warwick was then dead. The connection there is in the history of Gainford, with that of Castle Barnard, from this period, obliges the further progress to wait till that place is treated of.</P>

<P>The church of Gainford is a regular edifice, the chancel ten paces in length and fix in width; the windows to the north and south, were exactly similar, long and round topped; those to the north are now closed by the vestry room: the east end
<PB N="222" REF="282"/>is lighted by three long windows, ornamented with small round pilasters, belted in the middle, and a roll at the top and bottom: it is separated from the nave by a pointed arch, springing from brackets. The nave is 28 paces in length, having regular side ailes; in the whole 13 paces in width: each aile is formed by two
<PB N="223" REF="283"/>round lofty columns, not less than 18 feet in the height of the shaft, supporting pointed arches. The tower rises on four pointed arches, springing from clustered columns towards the body of the church, and from pilasters in the west wall.</P>
<P>Mr. Stephens communicated a fragment of an inscription dug up in the green; it was cut under an indented roll, and what was legible is as follows: ... AID the CETAE...... in a very rude letter.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Had it been perfect, perhaps it might have pointed out who built the fortress, or inclosed the citadel.</NOTE> Among many nations, the idea of put∣ting into the grave with the dead, utensils to which the party was most attached, hath prevailed; in a grave was lately dug up, a tobacco stopper, cut in boxwood, tipped with silver, marked I. T. a hand grasping a Bible at the top. In the green, were lately discovered, in a gravel pit, many human sculls, but no other bones, probably the evidence of some dreadful decapitation, in the feodal ages, by the guillotine.</P>

The family of Brackenbury falling into female issue, the estate passed to the Freemans, from whom it was purchased by the late Earl of Darlington.</P>
<P>The manor of Alwent was part of the ancient estate of the Nevills; a resident family very early assumed the local name; for about the year 1300, Ralph de Nevill, by his charter, granted to John de Alwent, 29 acres of land in Alwent∣moor, under a rent of 19 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> payable to him and his heirs for ever.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ex orig. penes G.

<P>LANGTON was one of the villages anciently resigned to the Earls of Northum∣berland, and never afterwards restored to the see; it was also part of the possessi∣ons of the Nevills: as was Summerhouse, an adjacent village. Of these we have little in the records.</P>
<P>The village of BOLAM stands on a lofty eminence, commanding an extensive prospect to the south and west. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, it is said, the tenants of Bolam, pay to the farmer's of Midridge Grainge, for liberty of watering their cattle at Wydhope stream. The family of de la Pole, held a considerable estate here. In the 22 <ABBR>d</ABBR> year of Bishop Hatfield, William de la Pole, chiv. held of Roger de Percy, Knight, jointly with Catharine his wife, seven messuages, 14 tofts, and 22 oxgangs and a half of land in Bolam, by the fifth part of a knight's fee, paying annually for castle-ward, to Barnard Castle, 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 5 <ABBR>d.</ABBR><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rudd's MSS.

The records do not note, that the Nevills held more in Bolam, than before specified; neither is it shewn to whom the great pro∣perty of de la Pole descended in after ages. The public records of this part of the county, are very imperfect; there having been frequent disputes, touching the exercise of jurisdiction, in the liberty of Castle Barnard, as a member of the wa∣pentake of Sadberg, and of the sheriffdom of that district. In the 3d year of Queen Elizabeth, by authority of her letters patent, one Purseglove, a priest,
<PB N="225" REF="285"/>founded a school and hospital at Guisburn in Yorkshire, and endowed it with his lands, tenements, rents, and services at Bolam. By a late division of the common fields there, this charity has received a great augmentation, and the country much improvement.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">By let. pat. dated 5th June, in the 3d year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Robert Purseglove was impowered to found this school and hospital, and thereby the guardians thereof were authorized to take lands, not exceeding 60 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, to whom should belong a common seal: in pursuance of which, he made a foundation deed, dated 11th of August following.

<P>MORTON TYNEMOUTH, a small village, has nothing remarkable; we discover no cause for the name of Tynemouth, there being no reference, in any records, to the monastery of Tynemouth, or any mines in the adjacent grounds, where tin could be wrought. In the time of Bishop Skirlaw, Agnes, the wife of Patric de Morton, died seized of divers lands there; and in the inquisition, the place is called Tylmouth, a name as difficult in its etymology as the former. This was one of the villages resigned to the Earls of Northumberland, and never restored to the see. Bishop Dudley granted licence to the convent of Durham to purchase lands here.</P>
<P>The parish of Winston intervenes between Gainsord, and the chapelries of Whorleton and Barnard Castle: which parish, it is thought expedient to attend to in this place, in order to prevent a disjunction of several important subjects, which would necessarily happen, by reverting to Winston, after treating of Barnard Castle.</P>

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF WINSTON.</HEAD>
<P>WINSTON is a manor belonging to the Duke of Bridgewater. The village is meanly built, on the ridge of a hill, close upon the river Tees. This was for∣merly the estate of the Scroops of Masham, and being forfeited by Henry Scroop, for treason against King Henry V. came to the see of Durham. By the inquisition, it is found that Henry was seized in fee, which would have grounded a forfeiture to the bishop; but by indenture, dated<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cursitor's Rolls.—Rudd's MSS.</NOTE> at Raby, <HI>in festo sc'i Hill. anno regni R' Edw. silij regis Edw.</HI> 7°. it appeared that he had only an estate tail, under the grant of Ralph de Nevill to Galfrid le Scroop, being the issue under that intail; and John being brother and heir, was intitled in remainder; till the 26th King Henry VIII. there was not any forfeiture of an estate tail, so that the bishop had not, in fact, any right to the forfeiture, surther, than of the life estate of the party. This coming to be inquired of, in the time of Bishop Nevill, he restored the manor by his charter, dated 15th April, in the 14th year of his episcopacy, to John the bro∣ther and heir of Henry, <HI>Hen'd. de dono uro,</HI> with a saving of the profits which had been answered by the escheator, in his account to the exchequer: the intail was never pleaded, or any judgment obtained for an <HI>amoveas manus,</HI> or any account demanded of the profits. How the manor afterwards came to the family of Men∣vill,
<PB N="226" REF="286"/>we do not discover; but in the 6th and 7th of Edward VI. and the nineteenth year of Bishop Tunstall, that prelate granted the same to Thomas Tunstall and his heirs, forfeited by the attainder of Ninion Menvill.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Cursit. Rolls.—Rudd's MSS.</NOTE></P>
<P>The church of Winston stands on an elevated ground, at the east end of the village; the whole edifice is about twelve paces in length, and eight in width, lighted to the east by three narrow windows, and to the south by three windows, and a small additional one: the chancel is divided from the nave by a circular arch; there is an aile to the south, formed by a round column and a broad one, supporting circular arches: it is decently stalled, and kept clean. The rectory-house stands on the brink of the banks, with hanging gardens in terraces; the landscape viewed from the windows is beautiful; the river flows in easy streams at the foot of the gardens, for a mile in length, crossed by the bridge described in the notes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bridge was built in 1764, for the accommodation of the country in the carriage of coals and lime from the county of Durham into Yorkshire, a large tract being supplied by means of that passage. The plan of the bridge was projected by the late Sir Thomas Robinson, the arch being the segment of a circle, whose span is one hundred and eleven feet, and the breadth at the top twenty feet. The eleva∣tion is such as to render the road level with the lands on the Yorkshire shore: it is built of bluish rag∣stone, of a hard, heavy, and durable nature. There are no appearances of a former bridge having stood here, yet, in the will of Ralph Nevill, Earl of Westmorland, dated at Raby, 18th of October, 1424, preserved in Madox's Form.

<HEAD>THE CHAPELRY OF WHORLTON.</HEAD>
<P>WHORLTON, where there is a chapel of ease under Gainford, stands on a level plot near the brink of steep cliffs above the river Tees; there is not a more beautiful situation upon the whole river, though it is at present neglected. The chapel stands on the south of the village, and from the adjacent ground, the prospects over the Yorkshire shore are excellent. To the south, you have a view of Wycliffe house, a new erected mansion, on an elegant plan, lately the seat of Marmaduke Tunstall, deceased, now of Francis Sheldon, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> his nephew, the retirement of the muses, the sciences, and polite literature; in front, you look upon Thorp, the mansion of the late family of Wilkinsons, now become the pro∣perty of Sheldon Cradock, of Hartford, in the county of York, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in right of his lady: nearer to the water, in the depth of the vale, lies the church and rectory-house of Wycliffe, and to the west you command a prospect of Morton-Hall, the ancient place of the Rookbies, together with Rokeby Park, the elegant seat of John Bacon Sawrey Morritt, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> The grounds around these several places are in the highest state of cultivation, graced with sine plantations, and other orna∣mental works; the river's banks are rocky and steep, fringed with hanging woods, or crowned with noble forest trees; the river falls in cascades hasty and sonorous; and the whole scene is more adapted to the descriptive powers of the pencil than of the pen. On the back terrace, adjoining to Wycliffe house, are two excellent views for the painter; one to the east, wild and august, abounding in rocks, hanging woods, and water; the other to the west in a tamer nature, commanding the vale through which the river flows, having Wycliffe church in front, inclosed on one hand by wooded banks, and fringed rocks, which overhang the stream; on the other by a rich cultivated scene, inclining gently towards the river: neither of the landscapes are too extensive to have due and dictinct expression of objects by the painter.</P>
<P>The manor of Whorlton was part of the forfeited estates of the Nevills, and is a member of the honour of Barnard Castle; it was comprised in the grant from the crown to the citizens of London, in trust for sale, more particularly mentioned in the account afterwards given of Barnard Castle; was purchased from the trustees by Taylor and Lee, who sold the same to Ambrose Johnson: in this family it continued till the year 1725, when it was purchased by Mr. Sanderson,

<P>SLEDWISH, in this chapelry, some time belonged to the Cloptons, of Warwick∣shire. This estate was forfeited by Ninion Menvill, and in the 5th and 6th of King Edward VI. was granted to Bishop Tunstall and his heirs, as a manor; soon afterwards it became the estate of the Wythams, and now is the property of James Poole, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in the right of his wife, only daughter of **** Allen, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> late of Greenwich Hospital.</P>

THE CHAPELRY OF BARNARD CASTLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE town of CASTLE BARNARD is situated on the southern inclination of a hill, descending swiftly to the river Tees. It consists of the several streets called Gallowgate, the Horse-market, the Great-market, Newgate, Thorngate, and Briggate, besides several lanes or alleys. The town is a mile in length: the markets occupy a flat, where the buildings are modern and handsome, and the street is upwards of forty yards in width; the Horse-market, the Great-market, and Thorngate, run, nearly in a parallel line. On the summit of a high rock to the westward of the town, stand the remains of the ancient castle, which gave name to the place. The air of this part of the county is remarkably salubrious, the market is cheap and abundant, coals are plentiful within the distance of eight miles: the town stands in a fine sporting country, and the situation possesses every advantage, to render a rural and retired life pleasant. The woollen manufactory, for which the place was happily situated, was some years ago in a very flourishing state, though now declining, from the great rise of cotton goods; much business is done by the tanners, and the stocking trade is particularly flourishing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Journals, House of Commons, 12th vol.</HI> 465, <HI>31st January, 10th William III. Anno</HI> 1698.
<P>A petition of the tanners, leather-dressers, and glovers of the town of Barnard Castle, in the county of Durham, was presented to the house, and read; setting forth, that the petitioners living at great distance from London, and other trading towns, their returns are so small, that they can scarce maintain their families; and since the duty upon leather, their trades are very much decayed, and their families reduced to the utmost extremity: and praying the house to consider of other ways to raise money, than by a tax upon leather.—Ordered, That the said petition do lie upon the table.</P>

<PB N="232" REF="292"/>together with the lordships of Middleton, in Teesdale, and Gainford, with all their royal franchises, liberties, and immunities. It is observable, that, at this period, mention is made of no other places, than Middleton, Marwood, and Gainford; and Marwood is named among the vills consigned to the Earls of Northumberland; the castle of Barnard, with the park and demesne lands, remain members of the township of Marwood to this time. In the old maps, a town of Marwood is delineated, where the present street of Gallowgate begins. On an eminence at the head of the street, where the roads divide, some few years ago, were dug up stepping stones and a broad pavement, by many apprehended to be the remains of the market cross of Marwood; but we rather conceive, from the name of Gallowgate, and the old name of <HI>Hang-slave,</HI> in the ancient records, that this was the place of execution, and these the remains of the engine used for decapitation in this great barony. Adjoining, is an old chapel, called Bedekirk, long disused, but not mentioned in any of the ecclesiastical registers, or records: all which contribute to strengthen the idea, that the original town was Marwood; and that, upon the erection of a fortress, the inhabitants being encouraged by the grant of privileges, were induced to build habitations under the protection of the castle, by which the ancient town of Marwood became deserted, and was suffered to go down.

<P>From what has been set forth, it is to be observed, that in the space of seventy years, this territory was granted out from the crown, the borough was constituted, and the castle erected, and had descended to the grandson of Gui. Barnard's charter shews he was not the original patron of this place, for though his deed has the language of a primary grant; yet, by reference to his father's act, it has only the operation of a confirmatory one; and we are so unfortunate as not to possess the original charter, or any minutes of it, further than the above evidence, and what is mentioned in the sequel. The instrument before us, is a grant and confir∣mation of privileges to the burgagers of Castle Barnard, and their heirs; which language of inheritance, is strictly applicable to a burgage tenure, and not ap∣plicable, in any manner, to a mere personal right: they are therein called liberties and free customs, and were to be holden of the grantor and his heirs in chief, in fee, and inheritance, similar to the liberties of Richmond. This reference leaves us in the dark, to what particulars the grant extended. The words <HI>quas dedit eis pater meus et concessit,</HI> though occurring in the habendum, carry no implication, that he granted any thing to Richmond. The words <HI>eis,</HI> grammatically referring to the burgagers of Castle Barnard; nor do we know that the Baliols had any interest in Richmond. The next record in point of time is a grant, made by Hugh Baliol, in the following form:</P>

Here are also words of <HI>inheritance,</HI> and the same construction must be given thereto, as before noted. Watershaw-beck, where it runs into Beckdam, and the road leading from Barnard Castle to Stanhope, are the distinguishing boundary marks of the common then granted, lying to the north and east of the town, and soon after taken up into husbandry, a description that includes the town-fields, which have lately been divided and inclosed by virtue of an act of parliament; and this description in no wise applies to the moor or common lands which lye to the north and west, for the name of Stanhope here signifies Stone-hope or Stone-hill, a place now called Stane-ton-hill.</P>

<P>In this instrument we find a second race of grantees, for he not only makes his charter to his burgagers, but also to the freeholders of the town, <Q>of a certain
<PB N="237" REF="297"/>“common pasture in Marwood, by the boundaries therein set forth, to wit, from a cross, called Roger Cross, by the wall up to the Saltury or Deer's Leap, under Stanley, on the west; and from thence to Egleston way, adjoining to Beacon∣stone gate, on the north; and so by Egleston way to the west foot of East-moss-mire bridge, and so in Blackdean towards the north; <HI>in exchange for lands which he had inclosed in his park; and others which</HI> the burgagers had released to him and his heirs. To hold the pasture so granted to the burgagers, and free∣holders <HI>and their heirs,</HI> of the grantor, <HI>and his heirs in fee and inheritance,</HI> as they ”held their other common pasture.</Q> But it was therein excepted, that the grantees should not take any wood, green or dry, within the limits, or dig in the turbary, or in the moor. The word Flatcht used in this place, is derived from the word <HI>flache</HI> in the old French; and signifies, in this record, that no pits or holes should be dug. In the preceeding grant, all the common land, from Beck∣dam and Stanhope, or Stainton way, was granted, being the east and north east portion of the wastes: by the last grant we have the western portion of the com∣mon lands conveyed, and for that purpose it was necessary, only to distinguish the outside boundary, and not to repeat the boundaries (Stanhope way and Beckdam) of the lands before granted; which were noted in the former instrument, for the purpose of distinguishing, with perspicuity, the granted from the ungranted lands; the description in the last grant ceases at that point, and doth not circumvallate (if we may use the expression) the ground comprised in the former deed; for the other boundaries were notorious, and the ancients hated a multiplicity of words in their instruments. It is to be observed in the last instrument, lands called a common pasture, are granted in fee and inheritance to two sets of subjects, capable of inheriting, to wit, those holding burgage tenements and freeholders; and no separate personal right, is thereby created. By these two charters, were granted to the proprietors of lands and tenements in Barnard Castle, a wide tract of coun∣try, the eastern boundary comprehends near 9000 acres of excellent ground, the western boundary, 700 acres of land, capable of high cultivation. John Baliol, then Lord of Castle Barnard, about the 14th year of King Henry III. founded an hospital there, which was dedicated to St. John the Baptist, which he endowed with lands; but the endowment, and every evidence of the original state of this foundation are lost, so that no more can be related of it, than what appears in modern instruments: the nomination of custos or master, has for many years past, remained in the lord chancellor and the master, in right of his office, receives a small yearly reserved rent from the lands, which are let out on a lease for three lives, renewable on payment of a moderate fine, much after the rate of the Lord Bishop of Durham's renewal fines. Three women are received into the house, who have 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> a month, and 25 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> every other year for gowns. The hospital stands in the south row of Newgate-street.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“There certainly was an hospital of St. John, valued, 26th King Henry VIII. at 5 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 15 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> in the whole 5 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d</ABBR> clear; and it seems to be yet in being; and the gift of the mastership to be in the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain.

<P>Great part of the lands with which the hospital was endowed, laid in the town fields; which were lately inclosed; and that fact proves they were in cultivation, and doled out between the time of the grant, and the foundation of the hospital, perhaps, previous to John's grant of the pasture; or otherwise, they were allotted out into stints or cattle-gates, but we prefer the former idea.</P>

<P>During the time of John Baliol, (son of John) who was adjudged to be King of Scotland by Edward I. we have the most perfect account of the franchises and privileges of this liberty; not only under the pleas of quo warranto, in the 21st year of King Edward I. but by other records and authorities: From some, it ap∣peareth, that there was anciently an itinerant judge sent to dispense justice: there was also a chief bailiff of the liberty or franchise; a constable of the castle, a forester, and a porter of the castle, with separate fees; and a coroner for that liberty was appointed by the lord thereof. Spearman observes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enq. p. 48. vid. Exempl 10th Hen. IV. Easington, Darlington, Chester.—Rym. Faed. v. 8. p. 572.</NOTE> <Q>That the Bishop of Dur∣ham “had his proper escheator, and three coroners allowed by quo warranto; his three coroners are in his own three wards, Easington, Darlington, and Chester, whereof Barnard Castle was not parcell, till of late, since the reign of Philip and ”Mary, he hath now his other coroner for Stockton ward.</Q> The office of escheat∣or hath been used within Barnard Castle, as appears by many writs awarded out of the chancery at Westminster, and inquisitions returned there. Spearman<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> says, <Q>Robert de Clitherhoe, and John de Sapy, successively exercised the es∣cheatorship “at Barnard Castle,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">q. Edward II.</NOTE> by grant from the crown; and afterwards, viz. <HI>Inquisit. capt. apud Castrum Bernard. coram Robert d' Chitherhoe escatore Dom. ”Regis ultra Trent, &amp;c.</HI> returned into the exchequer, remaining of record in the tower.</Q> It is to be observed, that the nomination of this officer, by the crown, was after Baliol's forfeiture, mentioned in the sequel. The lords of the liberty, had anciently divers knights fees, wardships, marriages, and reliefs there; and had the goods of the neif or native, which they frequently took into their hands. They had free warren and chace, with extent of large moors and wastes, in which they had the soil, mines, quarries, and other perquisites, from whence they made the grants before specified. They had the return of writs and warrants awarded thither, so that no officer or minister should enter there, but by writ <HI>de non omittas:</HI>
<PB N="240" REF="300"/>also, <Q>markets and fairs, pillory and tumbrell furcas and infangtheof, goods and “”chattels, of felons condemned within their courts;<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rym. Faed. v. 8. p. 572. 21st Edw. I. 1293.</NOTE></Q> toll and stallage, assize of bread, weights and measures, clerks of the markets, and all things, and privileges belonging to fairs and markets; and that none should keep ale-houses within that liberty, without licence of the steward in open court, for which there was a yearly rent of Brew-farm, anciently paid to the lord. On the forfeiture of John Baliol, Bishop Beck claimed his estates, as of the jura regalia of his palatinate, which is par∣ticularly mentioned in the annals of that prelate: the king, studious of humbling the proud Beck, and willing to abridge the over-grown power of a subject, in whose province was such a distinguished franchise, seized the palatinate; the re∣stitution thereof was not long of being obtained, but it came back to the prelate mutilated and abridged of those noble acquisitions it had so lately gained, by the forfeitures of Baliol and Brus. Goodwin tells us, whilst Beck possessed Barnard Castle, he made considerable reparations there, but what they were we are at a loss to judge. Edward, in contempt of the bishop's power, and palatinate jurisdiction, gave Barnard Castle,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dugdale Bar. v. 1. p. 229. An. 1316, Henry Fitz Hugh was constituted governor of this castle, by reason of the minority of the Farl of Warwick. Dugd. 403.</NOTE> with its members, to Guy Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, in whose family it continued for five descents. It doth not appear, that Beck made any struggle to regain the valuable appendages which had fallen to the see, and by violence were wrested from him; yet the matter did not sleep with his suc∣cessor; for, on his reconciliation with Edward II. he had the royal promise, that Barnard Castle and Hartlepoole should be restord: but the matter remained un∣settled, till Lewis Beaumont succeeding to the see, brought the same before par∣liament, and obtained a clear decision in his favour; on which a writ, <HI>de amoveas manus</HI> issued, directed to Roger Mortimer, then governor of Barnard Castle. There must have been some compromise with the Warwicks after this determination, for they were not deprived of the possession, neither do we find, on the part of the see, any act of right or jurisdiction exercised by Beaumont, remaining on record: on the contrary, the Warwicks acknowledged several fines, in which they did not even admit, that Barnard Castle was within the palatine jurisdiction, but passed the same before <HI>justiciar Domini Regis apud Westm. Octav. Hillar. Anno</HI> 18th <HI>Edw. III.</HI> &amp;c. when the other parts of the county levied fines at Durham; in the fine, it is said, that it was per licentiam ipsius regis coram Johanne Stoner et sociis suis justiciar. Domini regis apud Westm.; and another fine the same year, before John Sapy, and his fellows, of the same lands, found in an inquisition, taken 25th Henry VI.</P>
<P>An. 1398, Pat. 21. Rich. II. p. 1. m. 15. William Scroope, Earl of Wiltshire, obtained a grant, to himself and the heirs male of his body, of the castle, town, and lordship of Barnard Castle; and also of the manors of Middleton and Gain∣ford, part of the possessions of Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dugd.

<P>In the time of Bishop Langley, either from some jealousy of the burgagers or burgage holders, touching an infringement of their privileges, or some dispute rela∣tive to the rights of the lord of this franchise, or perhaps to perpetuate the testimony of a grant then lost; Nicholas del Spence and John de Yrland, bailiffs of Castle Barnard, and the burgagers or burgage holders entered into an instrument for the purpose of handing down to posterity the best evidence they could of such rights and privileges, setting forth, <Q>That the liberties of Castle Barnard were as follow, “to wit, that Hugh de Baliol had granted to all his burgagers of Castle Barnard, <HI>and all their tenants therein dwelling,</HI> common of pasture in his wood of Marwood, for all their cattle, without paying any agistment or pannage rent: also, that they might drive their cattle in Hermyre at their pleasure: that each burgager might have and make his furnace, without paying any consideration; also might have room for building, and to gather his dung in the way before his door to the middle way. That the burgagers should have the like free customs as Richmond. In case the grantor thought fit to erect a furnace, the burgagers and their tenants should have none without licence. To hold to the grantees <HI>in fee and inheritance.</HI> Also they ought to grind their corn, grown in their lands in the fields of Castle Barnard, at the lord's mill, at a sixteenth mulcture, and baker ”should bake their meal for a halfpenny, and find fuel for the furnace.</Q> We have no evidence of this charter, but what is contained in this inspeximus or rehearsal: the pasturage in the wood of Marwood was the eatage and herbage of the present common land, by the grants before set forth, specified to be a common pasture in Marwood; and the restriction in the last grant, touching the cutting of wood, implies that the same was forest ground, where there was mast and pannage.

What is particularly to be observed in the before noted licence of foundation, is, that thereby great contempt is thrown upon the palatine jurisdiction of the bishop, in whom was vested all legal authority for that purpose; and the king's exercise of that right, appears to be an arbitrary infringement of the franchises of the prelate.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the annexed plate, the seal of the burgagers, which is fixed to several instruments now in being, particularly their nominations of the chaplains and chauntry priests, fig.

<P>In the Egleston manuscript, before noted, it is said, that Barnard Castle, on the death of Richard, <Q>came to Henry VII. and so hath continued in the crown ever “since, as appeareth by several records and accounts, made by the constables of the castle and the bailiffe of that libertie, till it came to the Earl of Westmor∣land ”by marriage, and by him was forfeited 12th Elizabeth:</Q> this account wants much elucidation. In 1471, Richard Nevill, Earl of Warwick, was slain at the
<PB N="244" REF="307"/>battle of Barnet. His lady Anna, by the death of Henry her brother, without surviving issue, became possessed of his great inheritances, being his only sister of the full blood: after the death of Earl Richard, his lady's possessions, amongst which Barnard Castle was a part, were, by authority of parliament, taken from her, and settled on Isabel and Ann, her two daughters and heirs, the wives of the Dukes of Clarence and Gloucester, as if she had been naturally dead; and the same were with-held from her, till the third year of Henry VII. 1488, when the king, having a mind for Barnard Castle, the daughters being then dead, by a new act, annulled the former settlement, and restored her to the possession of the castle and manor, with power to alienate them; and the same year, on the 13th of December, by a special feofment and sine, she conveyd them wholly to the king, intailing it on the issue male of his body, with remainder to herself and her heirs.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, 307.</NOTE> The preceding manuscript says, Barnard Castle came to the Earl of Westmorland by marriage. How this happened, we are left to conjecture only: if it was derived in that manner, it probably came by intermarriage with the Buckingham family; Ralph, the third son of Humphrey, first Duke of Buckingham, married Margaret Countess of Richmond,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vincent, p. 87.</NOTE> mother to King Henry VII. and Ralph Nevill, Earl of Westmorland, married Catharine, daughter of Edward, last Duke of Buckingham of the Stafford line. Be that as it may, it is certain this castle and manor, after passing through the possessions of sundry persons, were the estate of Charles, Earl of Westmorland, at the time of his attainder, in the 13th year of Queen Elizabeth. The Bishop claimed the Earl's large estates, in forfeiture, but the parliament in∣terfered, and gave them to the crown, under pretence of making restitution for the expences sustained on that occasion, and particularly for her protection and care of the bishoprick. Sir George Bowes, of Streatlam; on the rumour of that defection of the Nevills, seized Barnard Castle, and filled it with troops; he de∣fended himself there against the rebel forces, until the Queen's army approached, previous to the affair of Bramham Moor. This manor and castle were granted by King James I. to Robert, Viscount Branspath, and Earl of Somerset, and re∣verted to the crown on his attainder. During the possession of the crown, various instruments were made, and now of record, relative to the forfeited estates, which it will be necessary to attend to. Queen Elizabeth caused an inquisition to be taken thereof; which now remains in the king's exchequer; but as it only exhibits a mere rental of the lands, nothing occurs therein worthy a place here. In the eleventh year of the Queen's reign, she demised the demesne lands of Barnard Castle, with some mines, to George Bowes for 21 years, and on the death of George, in the year 1581, she accepted a surrender of the lease, and for a sine renewed the demise for 21 years from that date: what appears singular in this record, and ir∣reconcilable is, the Earl of Westmorland was not attainted till after the 11th year of the Queen. The estates continuing in the crown, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and passing to King James I. he caused an inquisition to be taken there∣of, which, in the 12th year of his reign, 1616, was returned into his exchequer, where it remains of record. In this instrument many curious particulars appear,

For the maintenance of the Prince of Wales's household, King James consigned the forfeited estates; and in the 14th year of his reign, de∣mised to Sir Francis Bacon, Attorney General, and others, the castle of Barnard Castle, with the lordship or manor, for a term of 99 years, in trust to impower them to grant leases for 27 years or three lives, under certain rents, for the benefit of the Prince of Wales, and the survivors of the grantees, assigned to Sir Henry Vane, for the unexpired residue of the term.

The castle, honour, and privileges, with the parks, lands, and appurtenances, were purchased by an ancestor of the present Earl of Darlington; and in the 16th year of King Charles I. 1640, Sir Henry Vane had a grant from the crown of sundry privileges annexed to his manor of Raby, and honour of Castle Barnard.

<P>The remains of the castle cover about six acres and three quarters of ground; the parts of chief strength stand on the brink of a steep rock, about eighty perpen∣dicular feet above the river, on the north-west corner of the principal area, commanding a most beautiful prospect up the river. It is not possible to form any competent idea, by the present ruins, what this fortress was, in its original state, or greatest strength: it was inclosed from the town by a strong and high wall, with one gateway from the present market-place, and another to the north from the Flatts. The area entered by the market-place gate doth not appear to have had any communication with the chief strongholds and bulwarks of the place, but probably contained the chapel after mentioned: it is separated from the interior buildings by a deep fosse, which surrounds the rest of the fortress. This area is fenced with a high wall along the edge of the rocks behind Briggate, or Bridgegate street. In all this length of wall, there appears no cantonment, bastion, or turret: if ever it had embrazures, they are now totally gone. To the north, the wall has a more ancient and fortified appearance. The gateway to the Flats opens from a large area to the Roman road, which, on the one hand, com∣municated with the ford, that gave name to the village on the Yorkshire banks of the river, called Street-ford, now corrupted to Stratford; and on the other hand led towards Street-le-ham and Staindrop. This area, together with that before described, were anciently used to receive the cattle of the adjacent country, in times of invasion and public danger. The gateway last mentioned is defended by one half-round tower, or demi-bastion, and the broken walls shew some appearances of maskings and out-works: at a turn of the wall, towards the south, there was a tower, which, by its projection, flanked the wall towards the gate. Over the fosse there was a draw-bridge to the gate. In this area are the remains of some edifices, one of which is called Brackenbury's Tower, having deep vaults, now lying open; but as the ground is covered with a thick old orchard, it is impossible to form any distinct idea of the former state of edifices therein. The chief strongholds of this fortress stand on more elevated ground than any within the areas described; surrounded by a dry ditch or covered way,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gross describes it as out in the rock, but it hath not that appearance when examined strictly. —Several coins of Edward I. and Edward III. have been found within the castle walls, in good preser∣vation; a silver coin was lately found and brought to the author, the impression very distinct, but the characters or device, not yet explained by any one to whom it has been shewn.

<P>In a letter in Gale's MSS. from Mr. Warburton to Mr. Gale, in which he is tracing some of the Ro∣man roads, he says, <Q>It seemed to point at Barnard Castle, and if so, probably Stratford, near that place “was where it crossed the river Tees, both on account of its name, and being in a direct line to Old Town ”in Allendale, where I have chosen to place Alone.</Q> This learned writer's visiting the country, would have saved him from the mistake he falls into, from pursuing a favourite prejudice:—for the Roman road which led to Barnard Castle, was a way of communication or cross way, which proceeding from the High Street. or great read from Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terick to Bowes, led over the river at Stratford, and is visible in its full dimension and figure, along part of Lord Darlington's pasture grounds, called the Flatts, and then di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ppears where the hill has been ploughed; it is discovered again by Streatlam, and between Staindrop and West Aukland, a little to the southward of the present turnpike read, and so to the foot of Bilder∣shaw hill, where it joined to the great Roman road, from Piercebridge to Binchester.</P>
<P>Let. in his Itin, which was made in the reign of King Henry VIII. says, the bridge of Barnard Castle was of three arches: it is now of two eliptic arches, and at the end next Barnard Castle, in the battle∣ment, is a stone inscribed E. R. 1569; so it is probable, the old bridge was gone to decay, which occa∣sioned the present bridge to be built, at that period.</P></NOTE> with small
<PB N="247" REF="311"/>gateways through the cross or intersecting walls; this ditch is terminated on one hand by a sally-port that commanded the bridge to the west, and perhaps was anciently of use to scour the pase under the wall, now Briggate street; and the other sally-port to the north: the covered way almost surrounding the inner fortress. The area, in which the chief erections were arranged, is almost circular, and the buildings are of different aeras. Towards the orchard, the walls are of modern and superior architecture, supported by strong buttresses, and defended by a square turret towards the east: to the south, the wall appears very ancient and thick, and has been strengthened, by trains or lines of large oak beams, disposed in tiers in the centre of the wall, at equal distances, so as to render it firm against battering engines: on each side of the sally-port to the bridge, within the gate, was a semi∣circular demi-bastion, loaded with earth to the top, very strong, and of rough mason work, built chiefly of blue flints; the greatest part of one of the bastions still stands; the other, whose foundation only appears, has long been gone to decay. Here are some of the most ancient parts of the castle, and probably part of the works of the Baliols. The west side of the area has contained the principal lodgings, in some parts six stories in height: the state rooms have stood on this quarter; two large pointed windows, looking upon the river, seem to be the most modern; together with a bow-window hung on corbles in the upper ceiling, of which is the figure of a boar passant, relieved, and in good preservation: adjoining to these apart∣ments, and on the north-west corner of the fortress, is a circular tower, of excel∣lent masonry, in ashler work, having a vault, the roof of which is plain, without ribs or central pillar. This vault is 30 feet in diameter; the stairs, by which you ascend to the upper apartments are channeled in the wall. In the adjoining grounds, called the Flatts, in a large reservoir cut in swampy ground, called the <HI>Ever,</HI> water was collected and conveyed thence in pipes, to supply the garrison and cattle in∣closed within the walls of the outer areas, in times of public danger; for which protection the adjacent lands paid a rent, called Castle-guard rent, for the castle-ward. By the cognizance of the boar, and the apparent age of the buildings last
<PB N="248" REF="312"/>described, it is reasonable to determine, these were the works of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who, it is said, possessed this castle in right of his wife. Having given a short description of the remains of this edifice, as they now appear, we will cast an eye on the account given by Leland,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Itin. vol. I. fo. 93.</NOTE> when he visited this place in the time of King Henry VIII. <Q>From Stanthorpe to Barnardes Castle, by meatley good corne “and pasture, five miles.

The castelle of Barnard stondith stately upon Tese; the first area hath no very no∣table thing in it, but the fair chapelle, wher be two cantuaries. In the midle of the body of this chapel is a fair marble tumbe, with an image and an inscription about it in French. Ther is another in the south waul of the body of the cha∣pell, of fre stone, with an image of the same: some say that they were of the ”Bailliolles.</Q> There is not the least trace of this chapel remaining: some stone coffins lie in the ditch, which serve for water troughs for cattle.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We can discover the traces of no more than one chauntry in this chapel, which was dedicated to the twelve apostles.

By whom this chauntry was founded is not known; but it certainly was ancient, for Robert Proctour, chaplain, in August 1362, sets forth in his petition to Bishop Thomas, that the chauntry which he holds within the castle of Castle Barnard, was founded from time immemorial, and that he usually received for his support, five marks of yearly rent, out of the manor of East Conscliff, of which sum Ralph de Nevill, Charles, Lord of Raby, pays him 14 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> for his proportion of lands and tenements, which he holds in dower of his wife; but that the residue of the said five marks, was not paid from the time of the assignment of the dowry of Joan, the relict of William, Baron of Graystock, Lord of the aforesaid manor, because the escheator at the death of the said baron, had seized into the Bishop's hands, the manor above named, and with-held the usual payment, to the petitioner's great loss, and the disherison of the chauntry. He therefore prays the bishop to right him, and cause the arrears to be paid: all which particulars being found true, upon an inquisition at Sadberg. Rob. Elay als. Hillarie, was pensioned at 5 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann. 1553, in Willis's account of abbeys: and yet in Bishop Tunstal's Register (as if this charity had not been dissolved) it is mention∣ed, that Chr. Robinson, pbr. was instituted 28th May, 1554, p. m. ult. incumb. at the presentation of Queen Mary, the true patroness of this chauntry.—RANDAL'S MSS.
<P>What became of the tombs mentioned by Leland, no one knows; there is no memorial left of their being removed. In the walls of a house in Thorngate, built of stones removed from the ruins of the castle, and where the arms of Bowes are fixed, are three fragments of a monumental inscription, raised beautifully in the square text character, which put together make <HI>bxounabbat—Cui. a'ie Nicje—ur deus.</HI></P>

<P>The church of Castle Barnard stands on elevated ground. On the east side of the great street is a large and spacious building, in the form of a cross, with a
<PB N="249" REF="313"/>detached tower, formerly supporting a leaded spire; but that becoming ruinous, it was removed some few years ago, and the tower was raised sixty additional feet in height. The inside of the church is wretchedly stalled, the pavement broken and uneven, and the whole appearance slovenly and offensive. The chancel is in length fourteen paces, and six paces in width, with oak stalls: lighted by a large window to the east, of five divisions, under a pointed arch, and by four narrow windows to the south. It is divided from the nave by a pointed arch, rising from pilasters, with embattled capitals, inclosed with gates and stalls. You descend by three deep steps. The nave hath side ailes, the south aile being formed by three octagonal pillars, supporting pointed arches; the north aile, by one octagonal pillar to the east, supporting a pointed arch; and two round pillars, supporting circular arches: the length of the nave is nineteen paces, and the width, with the ailes, eighteen paces. The windows are irregular. The cross is formed by two additional porches, where chauntries have been founded: the whole length is twenty-eight paces.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Barnard Castle chapel, dedicated to St. Mary, value 30 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—A stipend from the Vicar of Gain∣ford, 6 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—Lord Crew's bounty, 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>—Lands in Yorkshire.—Lands at Holdswoth, Langley-dale.—Real value, 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>—In the deanry of Darlington.—Contains about 3000 inhabitants

<P>The environs of this place are remarkably beautiful, and the vale of Tees every where abounds with the noblest and most romantic landscapes: from Gainford to the head of the river, a course of near 30 miles, there is the greatest variety of pic∣turesque, pastoral, and august scenery, that any vale in the north of England affords. From the castle cliffs, northward, you view the river, forming a fine canal above a mile in length; on the one hand, bordered by a hanging forest of oaks, which climbs a regular ascent of a considerable height; on the other hand fine meadow lands, inclining gently to the river; the view is terminated by bold cliffs crowned with stately trees, and a farmhold of the Duke of Devonshire's, called Toller-hill-house. The walk to Toller-hill is much esteemed; it leads through level pasture grounds, by the brink of the river, whose banks are beautifully cloathed with wood. The view from Toller-hill-house, is at once elegant and august; you command the fine canal, the vale, hanging woods, and, at an agreeable distance, the ruins of Barnard Castle rise nobly on the landscape, in the centre, towering from lofty and broken cliffs; and on each flank, skirting the mount with long ex∣tended
<PB N="252" REF="316"/>tended battlements: the chief parts of the castle are seen in this view, the circular tower, and the most stately parts of the edifice, mantled with ivy; mixing a high colouring, for the painter's imitation; the brown rocks, fringed with brushwood, the brighter yellow towers, the dark and shaded battlements, and deep coloured ivy, are contrasted by the azure lake, on whose face they are reflected. Behind the ruins, the tower of the church, and some of the highest houses are seen; and the back ground inclines in a beautiful manner towards the chief objects, yielding the soft, yellow, and azure tints to the landscape. The pasture ground, called the Flatts, afford a fine terrace; a long level is formed on the brow of the hill, which, tradition informs us, was the old parade, or array ground, for the garrison of the castle; here the landscapes are various, you look upon the ruins and the bridge; you have a view up the winding vale of Deepdale, beautifully fringed with an indented forest; and taking a large stretch of the country northward, with a prospect of the elegant new-built mansion at Lartington, the seat of Henry Maire, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> At the extremity of the Flatts, is a walk on the summit of a deep and wooded dell, for a mile in length: a path is cut through the hanging woods, by the margin of the river, for two miles in length. South-eastward, lie the demesne lands, let out in pasturage, constantly open to the inhabitants for exercise and pleasure. By the path which lies on the margin of the river, through level meads, you are led to a new bridge, of one arch, over the river Tees, built by John Sawrey Morrit, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Rokeby Park: from this bridge, two excellent fine land∣scapes present themselves. To the north-west, you look up the river, which falls in innumerable cascades, foaming over rocks of porphyry; on the right, a hang∣ing forest crowns the cliffs: the extreme objects are the church, and part of the town of Barnard Castle; to the left, and in front, the beautiful ruins of Egleston Abbey, cover the summit of a bold eminence; a thick and solemn forest spreads a deep shade behind the ruins, and adds greatly to their awful magnificence. To the south-east, you command a long tract of the river's course, through a suc∣cession of rocks, whose summits are fringed with stately trees; to terminate this august avenue, at the distance of a mile, stands the delightful and elegant villa of Rokeby, with the park, one of the sweetest retirements on the banks of Tees.</P>

<P>The village of Stainton, called in some of the records, <HI>Stainton Law</HI> and <HI>Stainton en les Craggs,</HI> lies to the north, distant from Castle Barnard about two miles, is situated on a very exposed situation, and on the brink of large free-stone quarries, from whence the materials for the principal edifices in the neighbour∣hood have, for many years, been obtained: great part of the castle of Barnard is built of stone, got from thence. Stainton, though now a mean and inconsiderable village, was of some note in earlier times: it was one of the villages resigned to the Earls of Northumberland, and never restored to the see. Streatlam was ano∣ther
<PB REF="317"/>
<PB REF="318"/>
<PB N="253" REF="319"/>ther village, under the same resignation. The same persons possessing Streatlam and Stainton for several ages, obliges us to carry on an account of the two places together: great part of Stainton is still united with Streatlam; a small estate therein belongs to the family of Hutton, of Mask, in Richmondshire. Streat∣lam and Stainton were part of the possessions of the Baliols, and came to the family of Bowes, in the beginning of the 14th century. Bernard Baliol, Baron of Bywell, and grandfather to the King of Scots, gave Streatlam and Stainton, Broomlaw, Barforth, Cleatlam, Osmond Crost, and Huller Bush, in dowry with Agnes his neice, on her marriage with Sir John Trayne. This Agnes was the daughter and sole heir of Ralph de le Hay, Lord Percy; and Sir Adam Bowes married Alice, the daughter and sole heir of the before named Sir John Trayne, and Agnes his wife, and by that marriage, the large possessions of those families centered in Bowes. Amongst the records of St. Mary's, it is said, there was an entry in a book, relative to the foundation of the monastery, to the following effect: <Q>Alanus Niger Comes Richmondiae unus sundatorum hujus monasterij. “Iste Alanus Niger. frater Ducis Brittainae intravit Angliam in exercitu Willi'mi Conquestoris, cui dictus Willimus contulit pro servicio suo Dominium et co∣mitatum Richmond: Et postea idem Alanus primus Com.

<P>We cannot give greater antiquity to the castle of Streatlam, than the time of Sir John Trayne, and that too, by applying the title of Newcastle (which appears in some of the records) to this place; and that will bring it nearly to the age of 500 years. Sir William Bowes, in the beginning of the fifteenth century, rebuilt the castle after a Norman model, but what was its figure, magnificence, or strength, we cannot even form a conjecture, for the present castle was built on the old foundations, in the beginning of this century, on an elegant plan, as to its front; but by retaining many of the old apartments, it is not conveniently laid out. Nothing but a veneration for the ancient seat of the family, could induce Sir William Bowes to erect such a mansion, in so ineligible a situation. It stands in a deep vale, a small brook runs close to its front; high and irregular hills arise on every side, in some parts covered with a forest; the whole aspect is gloomy and confined.

THE PARISH OF STAINDROP.</HEAD>
<P>FROM Streatlam, passing towards Staindrop, you enter into one of the most beautiful vales in the county of Durham. On the high grounds above Streat∣lam Castle, you look down upon the town of Staindrop, seated in the bosom of the valley, having the Castle of Raby, with its extended parks and plantations, on the left, and on the other hand, a fine sweep of country, highly cultivated, incli∣ning
<PB N="257" REF="323"/>towards the northeast, with a distant landscape, scattered over with villages and hamlets.</P>
<P>Staindrop<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>A</HI> drop, villa seu villata—e. i. Villasaxosa, <HI>in warda de Derlington.</HI></NOTE> has one wide and extended street, lying east and west, in length about half a mile, with the church at the eastern extremity. It is well built, and is surrounded with excellent lands. This is a place of antiquity, being of con∣siderable importance in the time of Canuce, who, in veneration of Saint Cuthbert, during the episcopacy of Eadmund Bishop of Durham, gave his mansion house of Staindrop, with its appendages, as an offering at the holy shrine: Symeon, and the other authors,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. with the autho∣rities noted. Vide also Lumbarde's Dict. p. 324, referring to Chron. Lindisf.</NOTE> who speak of this transaction, say the appendages consisted of Cnapton, supposed to be Snotterton, Shotton, Raby, Walkerfield, Evenwood, Aycliff, Lutrington, Eldon, Ingleton, Thickley, Middletun, or Midleston: those places might be of Canute's gift, but there is no cause to credit they were otherwise appendages to Staindrop; several of them lying at a consider∣able distance. Bishop Flambard looked upon the territory, which the monastery held by the royal gift, with eyes of jealousy, and seized the dominion of Staindrop∣shire into his hands; but in the hour of contrition, on the approaches of death, he made restitution to the church, and yielded up those possessions. The convent, soon after the bishop's death, in the year 1131, whilst Algar was prior, granted Staindrop and Staindropshire to Dolphin, descended of Uchtred, to be holden of him in capite, reserving the yearly rent of four pounds.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Testib. Rob. Archid. &amp; Ranulf Arch. 1. Cart. fo. 186, D. and Ch. Lib.</NOTE> We frequently find in records of this antiquity, the word <HI>fil.</HI> for <HI>filius,</HI> used when the person spoken of was a grandson or great grandson of the ancestor referred to: so in the Stainton records, we see Robert <HI>fil.</HI> Maldred, when he was great grandson, and in the present case, Dolphin, in the record stiled <HI>filius,</HI> was great grandson of Uchtred; as is fully illustrated by the pedigree;<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See the pedigree, placed at Castle Barnard.</NOTE> which shews that the issue of Isabella, heiress of the Nevills, by Maldred, assumed the name of her mother's family, and was the first Nevill of Raby, in the beginning of the 13th century. In the year 1343, Ralph de Nevill obtained licence from prior John Fossour and the convent, to found three chauntries in the church of Staindrop: how the convent became en∣titled to exercise this jurisdiction, is not easy to prove; the records remain silent, save as to the fact: Bishop Bury then held the see, and the rolls of his time shew no confirmatory instrument. It should seem, that the convent had reserved the church, in their grant to Dolphin. From the authority of Dugdale's Baronage, it appears, that under some exchange, by grant, dated the 25th June, 1372, John
<PB N="258" REF="324"/>of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, had the advowsons of Staindrop and Brancepeth churches: if this was a fact, the advowson of Staindrop church must quickly after have come to the Nevill family, and probably by the gift of Henry IV. or the exchange was only a temporary one, and the advowsons were restored on the Earl's marrying the Duke's daughter Johan, to his second wife; for Bishop Hatfield, by his licence, dated the 24th Jan. 1378, impowered Ralph Nevill, Earl of Westmor∣land, to erect and found a college, of one master or warden, and chaplains, to be continually resident, together with certain poor or decayed gentlemen, and other poor persons, in the town of Staindrop; the same to be perpetual; and when the college should be so erected, that the Earl might give and assign thereto, two messuages and twelve acres of land, with their appurtenances at Staindrop, for the habitation of the master, clerks, and poor persons, together with the advowson of the church of Staindrop, towards their maintenance, and in support of divine service: the master, clerks, and poor persons, to be a body corporate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tanner's Notitia, p. 116.

By the entry in the bishop's register, it appears, that the foundation was much more liberal than is stated in Tanner, for we see from thence, that the original institution was for one custos, eight chaplains, four secular clerks, six esquires, six gentlemen, and six other poor persons; the licence doth not restrain the founder to numbers or their quality, the expression therein being <HI>nec non certis pauperibus generosis et ahis pauperibus,</HI> and it is most probable, the Earl intended this house for the reception of his military retainers, or those servants most immediately about his person, <HI>sex valectorum,</HI> who should be reduced by misfortunes, or otherwise disabled; and in that sense, the appellations of <HI>ar∣migerorum</HI> and <HI>valectorum</HI> will have the most proper application.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Cartam appropriationis Ecclesiae de Staindrop in Reg.

Rafe Neville, the first Erle of Westmerland of that name, is buried yn a right stately tumbe of alabaster yn in the quire of Stanthorp college, and Margarete his first wife, on the left hond of hym; and on the right hond lyith the image of Johan his second wife: but she is buried at Lincoln, by her mother Catarine Swinesford, Duchess of Lancaster. Ther rennith by the north side of the college, a bek, caullid Langley Bek; it risith at five miles of, by west, in the paroch of Middleton, and cumming thorough Langley, tak∣ith the name of it, and a mile or more beneth goith into Tese, lower than Sala∣by, ”Mr. Brakenbyrie's place.</Q> In the description of this church, occasions will offer to make remarks upon what is quoted from Leland; the chancel is in length 16 paces, and in width six paces; within the altar rails in the south wall, are three niches or stalls for the officiating priests. It is lighted to the east, with a large window, under a circular arch; two windows to the north, and three to the south, under pointed arches; the arms of Nevills, with quarterings, and the arms of England, in stained glass, in the cast window. The chancel is stalled with oak, twelve stalls on each side; and, some few years ago, was greatly crowded with two large table monuments, one of alabaster, the other of wood, highly decorated, having recumbent effigies, of excellent workmanship. The alabaster tomb stands nearest to the altar. Leland was not informed where Margaret, the first wife of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, was interred; she was the daughter of Hugh, Earl of Stafford, died the 9th of June, 1370, and was buried at Brancepeth: his second wife, Johan, daughter of the Duke of Lancaster, died the 13th November, 1440, and was buried at Lincoln. On this tomb lie three effigies in alabaster; the effigy of the Earl, represents him in complete armour, except the helmet, on which the head is rested, bearing the crest, a bull's head; the sculcap, which is much broken, has on the front, I. H. S. in the old character; the hands are elevated, in gauntlets, on the breast the cross; the legs are extended, spurs on the heels, and the feet resting on a lion. The ladies heads are rested on cushions, supported by cherubs, and at the feet of each sigure, is a desk with two kneeling clerks. Around the tomb are niches, ornamented with tabernacle work; but no inscription. The second tomb is of wood, and has three recumbent figures, also cut in wood. A plate of it is given in the Antiquarian Repertory, from a drawing of Mr. Bailey's. This is the monument of Henry, the fifth Earl of Westmorland; he married, to
<PB N="262" REF="328"/>his first wife, Anne, daughter of Thomas Manners, Earl of Rutland, by whom he had issue, an only son, Charles: Jane, his second wife, was daughter of Sir Richard Chomley, Knight; his third wife was called Margaret, but her family, we believe, is not noted. He died 9th Feb. 1564, and by his will, dated 18th of Aug. 1563, directed his body to be buried in the parish church of Staindrop, under the tomb that was last made, near to the lady Jane his wife. An inscription is raised round the edge of the table, in these words: <Q>This tomb made in the yere of wr Lord “God, 1560, and in the second yere of Elezabeth bi the grace of God Quene of England, Franc and Ierland, defendor of the faith bi the commandament of the right Honorable Hen. Erle of Westmerland for himself and his thre wives, that ”is to say, Anne, doughter to therl of Rutland, Jane, Margaret, doughters.</Q> No more remaining. Round the sides of the monument, within a kind of colonade, formed by small carved pillars, are awkward figures of the children, and above them, in the like character, the names of Elenor, Kathrin, Ralfe, Charls, Edward, Shon, Adeli, with a seventh, whose name is defaced. On the ends, are carved, the arms of the family, with a multitude of quarterings. His effigy is cut with a curled head, and pointed beard, a suit of armour, the hands elevated, without gauntlets; the legs extended, and the feet rested on a greyhound. The hands of the ladies are elevated, and the dresses remarkably awkward, and without ornament. The chancel is divided from the nave by a pointed arch; an elegant seat is formed where the roodloft was for the reception of Lord Darlington's family. The nave is regular, having two side ailes, each formed by five pillars; two to the east in each row, are round, with capitals garnished with roses; the two next are clustered pillars; the last, to the west, is clustered, but remarkably heavy, composed of va∣rious irregular parts. The arches are circular, except the last to the west, which is pointed, and supports the tower: the arches in the south row, are ornamented with the zizag figure, those on the north row have not that ornament, which gives much colour to what Leland says, that originally there was only an aile to the south, which was appropriated for the interment of the ancient family of the house of Raby, as appears by the tombs in the wall; where our author says, they made a cantuary or chauntry. It is before observed, that in 1343, Ralph de Nevill ob∣tained licence for founding three chauntries in this church, and it is probable the south aile was originally a porch for this pious purpose. There are two arches in the south wall, one of which appears to have been constructed for a superior personage, for the arch is ornamented with tabernacle work, at the summit of which is a bracket, as if designed to support a small crucifix or image, with a lamp or light; under this arch, is a recumbent essigy, but it is impossible to distinguish whether it is designed for an ecclesiastic or a female; it has a hood over the head, and the garments go down to the feet; the hands are elevated; near it lies another and the garments go down to the feet; the hands are elevated; near it lies another effigy in the same habit, that doth not seem to have originally belonged to that place; but when the aile was stalled, to have been put there merely to preserve it. To the east of this tomb, are three niches or stalls in the wall for the officiating clerks, who performed the ceremonies and masses for the dead. In the same wall is a similar circular arch, but without ornament above it: in this place is another re∣cumbent effigy, dressed like the former, with hands elevated, and the effigy of a
<PB N="263" REF="329"/>child set by it, not seeming to belong to the place. The figure, with a coronet, described by Leland; doth not lie in either of these recesses, nor is to be found in the church at this time. If there are any inscriptions on these monuments, they are so covered with the stalls, as not to be seen at this time. Most of the brass work is gone from the tomb-stone, which, Leland says, covered the remains of Richard, son of Edward, Lord Abergaveny: two of the escucheons of arms re∣main.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P>After the dissolution, this church remained in the crown, until King Charles I. created it a vicarage, at the petition of Sir Henry Vane, and thereby authorised Bishop Morton to institute a proper clerk, who should have capacity of taking lands and tenements; and Sir Henry was impowered to grant lands, tenements, rents, services, and other prosits, besides what King James had granted thereto; and he also thereby granted to Sir Henry and his heirs, the perpetual advowson, presentation, and right of patronage of the church for ever.</P>
<P>About a mile to the north of Staindrop, is RABY CASTLE, the seat of the Earl of Darlington: a noble pile of stately towers, retaining all the appearance of its antiquity, and giving the most perfect idea of a great baron's palace in the seudal ages. It stands on an eminence, is founded on a rock, and is surrounded with a parapet and embrazured wall, together with a deep fosse. It is probable, from the excellent situation, that on this plot of ground stood Canute's mansion, which he gave to the church with Staindrop, indiscriminately mentioned by ancient authors with Staindrop, and covered by that appellation. One of the towers, is of so singular a figure, that it prompts a conjecture of its being of great antiquity; we have no examples, that we recollect, of Danish architecture in the north, to afford a comparison; we can only make a supposition, that this bulwark was of that aera, and from its description, leave the reader to determine the probability of the idea. Leland visited this castle long before the forfeiture, and whilst the family of Nevills were in great magnificence.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The great possessions of the Nevills in this county, will best appear by reference to the inq. post mort. taken on the death of Ra. Earl of Westmorl. in the 20th year of Bishop Langley. "Compl. est p. inq. c. ap. Barnard Castel, &amp;c. q. d Rad'us nup. Com. Westmerl in dicto b'ri nominat. ob.

This Mildred had a sunne caullid Robert, and Robert had a doughter and heire caullid Emme, by whom the Nevilles had Raby. Ribaldus frater Alani niger Comitis Brittanniae et Richemonte, was lord of Middleham, and by marriage with an heire generall of this line, the Nevilles cam to Middleham. Da Raby, the first Erle of West∣merland, had a xx children by his wifes. Mary, one of the Lady Nevilles of Raby, was buried at Coverham, and her husband to, as I remember. From St. Andres Akeland to Raby Castel 5 miles, part by arable, but more by pastures and morisch hilly ground, baron of wood. Raby is the largest castel of log∣gingees in all the north countery, and is of a strong building, but not set other on hill, or very strong ground. As I enterid by a causey, into it ther was a litle stagne on the right honde; and in the first area, were but two towres on a ech ende as entres, and no other buildid; yn the 2 area, as in entring was a great gate of iren with a tour, and 2 or 3 mo on the right hond. Then were al the chief toures of the 3 court, as in the hart of the castel. The haul and al the houses of offices be large and stately; and in the haul I saw an incredible great beame of an hart. The great chambre was exceeding large, but now it is fals rofid and dividid into 2 or 3 partes. I saw ther a litle chambre wherin was in windowes of colerid glasse al the petigre of the Nevilles: but it is now taken down and glasid with clere glasse. Ther is a tower in the castel, having the mark of 2 capitale <HI>b</HI>'s from Bertram Bulmer. Ther is another tower, bering the name of Jane, bastard sister to Henry IV. and wife to Rafe Neville the first Erl of Westmerland. Ther long 3 parkes to Raby, whereof 2 be plenished

No man ever suffered a greater reverse of fortune, or brought it upon himself in a more simple or ridiculous manner; he fled into the Netherlands, where he was received by the Spaniards, and amongst them spent the remainder of his days, living upon a slender pension allowed him by the King of Spain. He was convicted of high treason, and outlawed, and the sentence was confirmed by the next parliament, 13th Elizabeth, 1571. He died in 1584, and the title became extinct. The forfeited estates continued in the crown, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and descending to King James I. he caused an in∣quisition to be taken of the manor and castle of Raby, with their appendages; to∣gether with the other manors, as before mentioned; and they passed, by grant, to the citizens of London, in trust to be sold, under which the ancestor of the pre∣sent Earl of Darlington purchased them.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vernon's Rep. v. ii. p. 733.

<P>We will take a cursory view of what modern visitors have said of this place, previous to a more minute description. The ingenious Mr. Grose, in his Antiquities of England and Wales, has presented us with two views of this castle, attended with descriptions, and also a plate of the ground plot. <Q>The situation, “in a park, beautifully admitting a view of the deer, is rather pastoral than romantic, being on the side of a vast amphitheatre of country, which affords a prospect of a rich cultivation, terminated by west and east by distant hills, and to the south by an extended plain, exhibiting that freedom now so much pursued in rural speculations. On the other hand, the nearer parts of the horizon are charmingly verged by plantations raised by the present noble owner, who, in every part of a very extended property, gives the highest proof of his attention and taste. Although the surrounding country boasts not much of the marvellous and sublime in nature, yet the deficiency of such objects seems amply supplied, in another stile, by the growing elegance of every reform, where convenience, profit, and order, are happily blended. The castle, with its nearly circular terrace, inclosed within a military wall, is said to measure two acres, and the demesnes annexed, to exceed thirty miles in length. As it is not the plan of this work, to delineate the face of a country, and still less to enter into agricul∣tural projects, we shall only observe, that the family has, for several years, carried ”forward extensive improvements.</Q></P>
<PB N="268" REF="336"/>
<P>In his second description, he repeats what is before given from Leland's Itinerary; and proceeds with descriptive notes, communicated by Mr. Pennant, many of which are judicious and highly pertinent, and will ornament the following descrip∣tion: in the book entitled a New Display of the Beauties of England, Raby is thus spoken of— <Q>It is a noble massy building of its kind, uninjured by any “modern strokes, inconsistent with the general taste of the edifice; but simply magnificent, it strikes by its magnitude, and that idea of strength and command naturally annexed to the view of vast walls, lofty towers, battlements, and the surrounding out-works of an old baron's residence. The building itself, besides the courts, covers an acre of land; the size may from thence be concluded. The south front of it is very beautiful, the centre is from a design of Inigo Jones; nothing in the Gothic taste can be more elegant than the stile and proportion of the windows. The rooms are very numerous, and more modern in their pro∣portion and distribution, than one would easily conceive to be possible within the walls of so ancient a building; but, by means of numerous passages and closets, many of which have been scooped out of the walls, and back-stairs, the apartments are extremely convenient, well connected, and at the same time perfectly distinct: several improvements have been lately made, which add greatly to the spaciousness and convenience of the apartments in general. The bed chambers and dressing-rooms are of a good size and proportion, and some of the lower apartments large and elegantly fitted up. One of the drawing∣rooms is thirty feet by twenty; and the adjoining dining-room is fifty-one by twenty-one; the windows of both of plate glass, and in the smallest and lighest of brass frames. Near the dining-room there is a rendezvous apartment, ninety feet long, thirty-six broad, and thirty-six high; a proportion that pleases the eye at the very entrance; an addition of thirty feet in length is now making, terminated by a circular tower, in the same stile as the rest of the castle; by which means the south front is greatly improved, and the room receives not only an additional space, but the light of a circular window. The park and orna∣mented grounds around the castle are disposed with very great taste. The lawns, woods, and plantations, are objects remarkably beautiful. Entering the lawn from the plantations near the house, the whole sweep has a very fine effect. The dog-kennel, a Gothic ornamented building, is seen on one side rising out of a fine wood, and beautifying the scene much: upon the hill, to the right, is a Gothic farm-house, a simple but pleasing design, in a very fine situation; in front, along the valley, several clumps of trees are scattered, and between them a farm-house belonging his lordship, on a distant rising hill; a building which greatly ornaments the grounds. This part of the lawn is finely inclosed on three sides with thriving plantations. This leads into the extended part of the lawn, which is, for its extent, as beautiful a one as can any where be seen: the inequality of the ground is remarkably favourable to its beauty; it consists of fine sweeps of grass, stretching away to the right and left over hills most elegantly spread with plantations on each side, and presenting to the eye a fine waving uninterrupted surface through a valley, till it loses itself in such a manner among the woods, as to give room to the imagination to play
<PB N="269" REF="337"/>and picture an extent superior to the reality. In front, upon a fine rising hill, is situated the farm-yard, with a most elegant Gothic screen in it. From this hill, you look back on a very fine scene. To the left, the whole is bounded by a most noble range of planted hanging hills, which extend to the woods in front, surrounding the castle in a most picturesque manner: the hollow scoops of lawn are peculiarly beautiful. To the right it has a noble sweep through the valley, with a prodigious extensive prospect over it to Rosbury-topping, (in Cleveland:) nothing can be more beautiful than this whole view, which is composed of the most elegant disposition of the ground imaginable; the hanging hills spread with wood, the hollow scoops of grass, spacious lawns, and distant prospect upon the whole, fill the eye and please the imagination. Winding up to the right, and moving along the terrace, which is a natural one, but leads through an extensive plantation, the views it commands are fine. You look down upon the farm, and the hills upon which it stands, which waves through the valley in a most pleasing manner: throwing your eye more in front, you catch a lake breaking upon the view in irregular sheets of the water, just over the tops of the lower woods; the effect most truly picturesque. Upon the right, the whole valley is commanded, and the village of Staindrop, well situated among inclosures and straggling trees. Advancing, the prospect varies; a fine sweep of cultivated hill is seen upon the left, and the Gothic farm-house, ornamenting all the surrounding grounds; descending into the vale, you catch the village and church of Staindrop most picturesquely among the trees. Further down, from among the sloping woods, through which the riding leads, the castle is seen rising most nobly, from a foreground of wood, in a stile truly magnificent. Crossing this part of the lawn to the lower terrace, you meet with grounds be∣fore unseen, which are excellently disposed; the plantations judiciously sketched, and the views pleasing. The whole range of ground is seen to very great advantage, by riding along the southern plantation: you there command the whole, from the castle on one side, to the hills beyond the farm house on the other; and the sweep of plantations here appears very noble. Upon the whole, plantations disposed with more taste are no where to be seen; none which are sketched with more judgment, for setting off the natural inequalities of the ground, and managed more artfully for presenting, on a small space of land, a large extent of surface to the eye: nor can any thing of the kind be more beautiful than the lawn, which spreads among the woods, so as to appear in different sweeps, indenting the groves in some places, and breaking through them in others. No object in the stile of ornament, can be more agreeable to itself, or more striking from its situation, than the farm-house, which is seen from most ”parts of the ground, and always to advantage.</Q> This description would not have been wholly repeated, but, as the greatest part of it came from the pen of a popular writer, from whose Tour it was extracted, and given a place in the periodical work from whence it is now copied, it may be excused with all its repetitions.— There are several approaches to the castle, one for domestics, another leading to the Darlington road, a third from Staindrop bridge, and a fourth is projected, to lead from the Durham road, near Keverston house; by the road leading from
<PB N="270" REF="338"/>Staindrop bridge, the approach is remarkable; the visitor ascends gradually through the park, towards the south front of the castle, which presents itself in the noblest point of view, surrounded with an embrazured wall, and a fosse cut in the solid rock, and flanked with extensive plantations; the prospects on each side open upon the view, as the traveller advances. The back-ground, though near to the chief objects, rises boldly, covered with a forest. The new projected road, already cut through the wood, as it descends from hills much higher than the castle, will surprise the traveller by opening abruptly upon the castle, and the beautiful vale beneath it; commanding at once the park, and all the walks which surround this noble place, the town of Staindrop, and that long reach of landscape which is terminated by Cleveland hills; and on which the spires of Darlington and Conscliff churches, with a multitude of villages, are striking objects.— There is but one entrance into the outward area of the castle, by a gate on the north side, guarded with two square towers, and flanked with a parapet, gar∣nished with turrets. There are two entrances from thence into the inner area, one opended by the late Lord Darlington, the other an ancient one: the ancient entrance is from the west, by a double gate and covered way, strengthened by two square towers, which <HI>flange,</HI> as the builder's term is, or expand from the gate, and present an angle in front: an outside passage, from one tower to the other, is formed by a hanging gallery over the gate. Here are three shields of arms of the Nevill family, gartered; which matter determines the antiquity of this gate. The covered way is fourteen paces in length, with a groined roof, and has an inner gate, the arches are circular, and both gates have the portcullis. This gateway, at irregular distances, is flanked with square towers: there appears to have been some modern additions to the south, which close the pass, and cut off all com∣munication with the southern part of the area or platform, that otherwise would completely surround the castle; and in ancient times, when it was aplace of defence, it is reasonable to believe, would be laid open. In Mr. Grose's work, it is called a "parade, garnished with battlements." From the square tower, which flanks the gate to the north, a hanging gallery forms a communication with a large square bulwark opposite the outward gate, now called Clifford's Tower. The names of several of the towers have given occasion for a conjecture, that whilst the castle was in the hands of persons, whose names the towers still retain, they added those works thereto: but this idea has no foundation in historical facts; and it is to be apprehended the names were given in compliment to distinguished persons, to whom they were consigned to be defended or garrisoned. From Clifford's Tower, castward, is a hanging gallery which communicates with a smaller square tower, strengthened with turrers. From thence, eastward, is a modern curtain wall, which conceals a recess, and adjoins to a gateway, lately formed between two small square towers, from whence a passage is made under the ancient chapel. This entrance is the most judicious and elegant improvement the castle has received in any age: by this entrance carriages pass into the large Gothic saloon, the roof of which is arched and <Q>supported by six pillars, the capitals diverging and running “”in ribs along the root.</Q> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE> A flight of steps leads to the presence chamber, a
<PB N="271" REF="339"/>semi-circular room, where the company set down in the saloon are introduced: from thence passages lead to the chief apartments; the carriages pass through the inner area and covered way, so that a long train of carriages may set down their company without the least interference. Above this saloon is a hall <Q>of the first “”magnitude,</Q> which forms one side of the square of the inner area, <Q>is ninety “feet in length, thirty-six in breadth, and thirty-four in height; the roof is flat, ”and made of wood,</Q> the joints ornamented with shields of arms of the family of the Nevills. <Q>Here assembled, in the time of the Nevills, seven hundred knights, “”who held of that family.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pennant.</NOTE> A gallery of stone crosses the west end of this room, used in ancient times for music, and that mimicry, with which our ancestors were so much pleased.—From the gateway, a modern curtain wall runs to a lofty tower, which appears to be of the highest antiquity of any part of this castle; its figure is that of an ancient arrow-head, with the sharp edge or point to the south; it has four tiers of apartments or floors, and the battlements are garnished with turrets on the three angles to the south, to which you ascend by eighty-nine steps: the masonry is excellent, the front is chisselled, the joints are compact, and the interior parts of the walls are run with hot lime: from the top is a most extensive view south-eastward, in which are comprehended, and distinctly seen, Conscliff, Darlington, Sadberg, Long-Newton, Stockton, with Cleveland and Hamilton hills, at the greatest distance. The eminence where Heighington stands, cuts off the view further to the left hand. Near the summit of this tower, are raised in the stone work two letters in the old character, <HI>h,</HI> from whence, and the name this tower now bears, it has been inferred, that it was built by Bertram Bulmer, a con∣jecture refuted by the circumstance before mentioned, as to Clifford's Tower: perhaps it was repaired under the directions of Bulmer, and was then named in compliment, on account of the intermarriage of the families; it now stands de∣tached from the rest of the castle, and it is said, was separated by a fire, which consumed the intermediate erections. This is the part of the castle, on which we presumed to raise a conjecture, that it owed its origin to Canute, if any part of the edifice can be attributed to that age. The singularity of the figure leads to the supposition: neither the towers attributed to the Anglo-Saxons, nor the Norman castles, in any instance that we have observed, shew a geometrical figure any thing like this: Bertram Bulmer's heiress married Galfrid de Nevill, and he died in the fifth year of Richard 1. 1194, and their daughter and heiress married Robert, the son of Maldred, Lord of Raby; from whence the idea of this being Bulmer's Tower gathers little support; the second Bertram was descended of a younger branch, and was Lord of Bulmer: it is most probable the letters are denominative of the year in which the repairs were made, and that b was then dominical; of which application we have an instance in an inscription in Conscliff church, before noted. From this tower you advance to the south front. After the descriptions before quoted, little more need to be added, in order to impress on the reader's mind an idea of the magnificence of this ancient stucture. Speaking of some of the apartments, Mr. Grose, from Mr. Pennant's Notes, says,— <Q>In the breakfast room, the recesses are “in the form of semi-circles, scooped out, I may say, of the walls, which are nine seet one inch thick; a window is in each of these. I saw also a recess for a bed,
<PB N="272" REF="340"/>gained out of the wall, and several other conveniences and communications quarried out of it; and in some places pillars are left, as in collieries, to sup∣port the roof. The oven was of dimensions suited to the hospitality of those times, higher than a tall person, for the tallest may stand upright in it; and I think its diameter must be fifteen feet. At present it is converted into a wine cellar; the sides are divided into ten parts, and each holds a hogshead of wine in bottles. The kitchen is a magnificent and lofty square, has three chimneys, one for the grate, a second for stoves, the third for the great chaldrons. The top is arched, and a small cupolo lights it in the centre; but on the sides are five windows, with a gallery passing all round before them, and four steps from each, pointing down into the kitchen, but ending a great height above the floor: their use is not known. From the floor, is another staircase that conducts to the great hall, but the passage is now stopped.—What hecatombs must have been ”carried that way.</Q> To this account must be added, that the kitchen is a square of thirty feet; the side where no chimney is, opens into the larders: opposite to the grate, the steps descend to the floor, and are wide enough for three persons abreast: on each of the other sides, to the right and left of the grate, are two windows, with five steps descending, but not low enough to enable the persons who should stand thereon, to receive any thing from those in the kitchen: there are narrow passes channelled in the walls, but not capacious enough, we conceive, to allow a person to bear a dish of provisions for the 700 knights and retainers of the Nevills. Did not this place bear so great a resemblance to many of the old monastic kitchens, one would be apt to conjecture it was used formerly as an armory, from whence the instruments of war, bows, arrows, spears, javelins, &amp;c. could be distributed quickly to all parts of the castle. There are several good paintings in the chief apartments; in the dining-room in Clifford's Tower, is a large music piece, containing the group of figures Rubens placed in the centre of the marriage feast of Canaan, in which he disposed his own portrait as a chief musician, with his cotemporaries as performers: this painting is in good character, but no author named. In the same room is an excellent portrait of Lord Mansfield, and there are many others of personages connected with the present family, in that room, and distributed in other apartments. It must be added to the former description of the park and pleasure grounds, that the terrace where it lies open, beyond the pass through the plantations, is seven hundred and sixty paces in length, and commands a noble prospect. In the front ground, the canal is a beautiful object, lying in the bosom of a park, ornamented with those improvements which art can only give, when applied to soften and not distort the face of nature; over the planta∣tions, which skirt the park, Staindrop church, with parts of the town, are seen; from thence to the east, Sellaby-house and wood; further advanced, are the villages of Hilton, Ingleton, and Langton; and a distant sweep of cultivated country, which, with a richness of colouring, prepares the eye to receive the terminating objects, Hamilton hills, in Yorkshire, mixing their azure hue with the sky. In front, over the beautiful foreground, with Staindrop before mentioned, you command a view towards Forcet, with the conic eminence called Didersdale Hill, on Gatherley Moor, the arrangement of clumps and plantations above Sir Thomas Dundas's seat
<PB N="273" REF="341"/>at Ask, with the church and village of Kirby Ravensworth: the villages of Gales and Barningham, and a hanging landscape dotted with woodlands, surmounted by the brown mountains of Hope and Arkendale: to the westward, an inclining tract of cultivated country, with the road leading to Barnard Castle; the vale filled with the woods of Streatlam and Lady Close. From the terrace, the grounds of the park lie in an easy slope to the bath house, covered with fine plantations.</P>
<P>The late Lord Darlington's farm and farm-yard, were objects deserving the best attention; the farm included lands of the annual value of 1200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> wherein every noble erection, for useful knowledge in husbandry and beneficial improvement in modern agriculture were practised; his lordship retained one ancient usage, which gave pleasure to every eye; in his farm, you might see the tillage land ploughed by between twenty and thirty teems of four oxen each; the custom of tilling with horses not prevailing with his better judgment. In the farm-yard were close stands for upwards of forty oxen, besides an open spacious fold, with a cistern of water constantly running: there were covered racks and pens for eight hundred sheep, with other conveniences, of barn room, sheds, stables and offices, suitable to the magnitude of the farm: the common pasture exceeds three hundred acres: this was a treasure of enjoyment and health to his lordship; and an example worthy the emulation of every lover of his country. The present earl is attentively engaged in the defence of his country, as Lord Lieutenant of the county of Durham, and Colonel of the Militia.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Above the gateway of the screen which covers the farm-yard, is a large sculpture of a bull, bearing an ensign of the Nevills' arms, and over the shoulder a mantle, with the same arms; this, it is said, was removed from the towers, above the new entrance into the Gothic saloon. From the eminence near this gate, you have a view of the new water-works, which his lordship is bring∣ing round the south skirts of the park, in canals, and falls, as the nature of the ground admits; a work which will take some years to complete, and will be a grand and elegant improvement to the noble scenes.</P>
<P>In Langley dale, is a tower on a fine mount, an ancient outpost and guard to the castle: this was the residence of a favourite lady, occasion∣ally visited by one of the Earls of Westmorland; it is close upon the banks of the brook, the vale is romantic, and this bower well situated for retirement, and secret amour.</P>
<P>Slaughter Closes, from their name, imply that they were at some time the scene of battle, but there is no tradition or history to lead to the fact: human bones were lately dug up, the rusted points of pikes and remains of armour found: at a place further to the north, called Scotch Stone, in casting a trench some few years ago,
<PB N="274" REF="342"/>a large collection of human remains was cut into: no account is to be obtained of this matter.</P>
<P>KEVERSTON, called in the old records KEVERSTON GRAINGE, is about half a mile to the north of Raby, on a sine elevated situation, commanding an extensive prospect over a delightful valley to the east; it anciently belonged to the Setons, was held of the prior of Durham, and was forfeited by Christopher Seton, nearly allied by marriage to Brus, in the time of Bishop Beck; during this prelate's dis∣grace at court, Keverston was given by King Edward I. to Geoffrey de Hethpole; it was part of the possessions of the Nevills, as a member of Raby, and in later times was the seat of the family of Burtons, from whom it was purchased by Lord Darlington's ancestor.</P>
<P>WALKERFIELD, a small village to the north-east of Raby; one of the places said to be given to the church of Durham by Canute; in Bishop Langley's time, it appears that a family of Sockburns held lands here under the Prior of Durham by fealty, and 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF MIDDLETON.</HEAD>
<P>RETURNING towards the river Tees, we enter upon the large common called Barnard Castle moor, before mentioned, and pass along the side of the vale of Langley dale, in our approach to Egleston, a chapelry in the parish of Middleton, for the sake of distinction called Middleton in Teesedal. Near the head of the moor is Bail-Hill, defended to the south by a breast-work and deep trench, terminating in a morass. This is a well chosen spot for an army of obser∣vation, or detachment of scouts, as it commands an extensive prospect down Langley dale, and along the whole range of hills above Raby; you view Merrington and Westerton, the latter of which places lies two miles east of Bishop Auckland; Brusleton Tower above West Auckland, Hilton Town, Heighington, and all the vale to the southward, with Cleveland hills, stretching away to the Teesmouth; and to the south-west the Yorkshire hills, with the vale of Tees, and various villages and hamlets, scattered along the river's banks: the station has only been temporary, perhaps made on some incursion of the Scots, as a safeguard from attack by troops lying southward, or the garrisons of Castle Barnard and Raby. Many coins of Edward I. and some of Alexander of Scotland were found near this place. Pass Shipley House, called in the old records Marwood Hag, on the left, a farm belonging to the family of Bowes, and by them purchased of the Simpsons.
<PB N="276" REF="344"/>Advancing further about a mile, come to an opening of the vale, at a place called Foxgyll, from whence the prospect is highly romantic and picturesque; the hills, more lofty and rugged, now form a grand amphitheatre, in circuit about fifteen miles, embosoming a beautiful valley: in front, the town of Egleston, scattered over an irregular foreground, and Egleston House, embowered with lofty sycamores; the river, in meanders, discovering itself in a variety of streams and shining canals; to the left, the town of Romaldkirk,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Arthur Lee and Edw.

Laithkirk, a chapel to Romald-kirk, crowns an eminence, whose skirts are scattered over with wood, and the lower grounds are finely diversified with swells and little groves, along the whole vale. Near the extremity of the circus, is Middleton, and the back-ground of the landscape is formed of columnarious rocks, and broken precipices behind Lonton: to the right hand, the range of hills is covered with brown heath, which gives the highest contrast to the beauties of the painted valley.</P>

The vale is picturesque, and the several landscapes in view, to the east and west, romantic and wild; consisting of part of the scene before described, reduced to a narrower scale, by the house lying deeper in the valley.

In 1632, Child and Britain conveyed the manor to Tobias Ewbank, of Staindrop; from whom it came by purchase to the family of Sandersons, and in the beginning of this century was sold to Mr. Hutchinson's ancestor. There are lead-mines in this district, which have been wrought since the time of Edward VI. as appears by authentic records:
<PB N="277" REF="345"/>it is probable the Romans wrought the mines here, for various ancient workings have been discovered, and tools and implements found therein, the use of which was not known to the most experienced miners of this age: they knew, or at least practised in Britain few mechanical powers; and when they met with foul air or water in the mines, they were obliged to desist; so that in both lead and coal-mines, their workings could never be deep, or indeed very material. There are several ancient basons, formed of stone-work, scattered over the moor, wherein lead-ore was smelted, or run by force of fuel heaped upon it, assisted by the wind, before a mill or bellows was used.</P>
<P>A small farm, high up in the moors, called <HI>Hope,</HI> belonged to the monastery of Riveaux, and, after the dissolution, was purchased of the crown by William Bitchburn and Roger Marshall, who sold it to Ralph Tailbois, of Thornton, from which family it passed to Richard Clarvaux, of Crost, and afterwards came to the Tempests. A farm of land, called Foggerthwaite, to the north of Egleston, was part of the ancient possessions of the Scroops, in 1638 was conveyed by Lady Scroop to Anthony Maxon, and afterwards came to Sir Nicholas Tempest: this, with an old mansion and farm called Stotley, near adjoining, which anciently belonged to the family of Cumins, are part of the possessions of the Boweses.</P>
<P>A mile to the north of the village of Egleston, above a little brook, stands an
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
ancient monument, called <HI>Standing Stones,</HI> represented in the cut. It has consisted of an uniform circle of rough stones, with an in∣ward trench, and in the centre a cairn; much of the materials have been taken away to repair the roads.— At a small distance, and close by the brook, is a large tumulus, crossed from the east to the west by a row of stones. The adjacent ground, forming an inclining plain, was probably the field of battle, and the monuments mark the place of interment of some distinguished chieftains. There is no circumstance in history, which we can, with any certainty, fix here.—The monuments are of distant antiquity.</P>
<P>Proceeding by the foot of Foggerthwaite inclosures, the road hangs on the river's banks; and the view into the vale, though narrowed, comparing it with the prospect from Foxgyll, comprehends a landscape much more elegant, as many objects are opened to the eye, which were from the other station concealed by the interposition of high lands. The foreground here is rocky, rugged, and extremely wild; from whence you look into the valley, which forms a crescent: to the east, the river, in its various windings, exhibits six distinct canals, having Egleston levels on one side, wooded banks and rising inclosures on the other; the town of Romaldkirk, with the tower of the church, sinely emerging from a thick grove, in the centre; Shipley-house, and steep hanging inclosures, to the north; the York∣shire
<PB N="278" REF="346"/>hills, above Ravensworth, with the white tower of Kirby church, a terminating obelisk, at the distance of ten miles, fill the back-ground. Turning to the south∣ward, you look down upon Mickleton, which winds its buildings round an extensive green, in an oval figure; below the town, is a plot of rich meadows, and the inter∣common, or town-field, striped by the variety of culture, spreading forth a beautiful inclining plain to the margin of the river, variegated with ribs of corn, grass, and fallow land, and rows of bushes, intermingled in different directions; the river Lune winds down a narrow valley, pent in by hanging mountains, and empties itself into the Tees, through broken banks, fringed with brushwood; the nearer eminence is crowned with the Laithkirk and a few trees, the more distant hills are lofty, grey, rocky, and wild. To the north, the windings of the river through a fine plain are beautiful; on the right is a conical eminence, crowned with fir trees, and skirted with brushwood, round which the river winds; above that object, stands the little village of <HI>London,</HI> surmounted with columnarious and rugged rocks, and pent in by barren and shaken mountains: part of the town of Middleton is seen over the verdant vale, and all above are mountains crowding behind mountains.</P>
<P>The town of MIDDLETON is scattered along the sides of the hills, in no part forming a regular street, of any considerable length. The church and rectory house stand on an elevated situation, to the north of the town.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Middleton super Tees rectory. The king patron.

Number of burials in the last year 37.—Computed number of inhabitants 1010.</P></NOTE> The chancel is in length eleven paces, and in width near five paces, and is lighted by four windows,
<PB N="279" REF="347"/>one to the east, and three to the south, under pointed arches. The nave is fifteen paces in length, and, with an aile or porch to the south, is eleven paces in width. It is lighted by a west window, and two windows to the north, and three irregular windows to the south, with one in the aile to the east. The aile or porch is formed by one wide arch, rising from a heavy square pillar, and two narrow arches, supported on a round pillar, in height, from the base to the top of the capital, five feet six inches; by the uncouth architecture, one may conjecture this fabric was built before the time of Barnard Baliol, who, it is said, gave the church to St. Mary's of York, with Gainford: but it appears that an agreement was made in the time of John Baliol, wherein the right of presentation was reserved to the Baliols, and thence it comes, that such right of presentation descended with the estates, till the forfeitures of the Nevills carried it into the crown; and it was from the middle of the thirteenth century severed from Gainford.—By Barnard Baliol's grant, it is specified, that Middleton was a chapel in the time of his father, but when or how it became rectorial, we have no records to demonstrate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide grant Mon. Angl. vol. I. p. 393.</NOTE> To the west is a tower, separated from the church several yards, in which the bells are hung.</P>
<P>The Baliols had an ancient forest here, which, since the forfeitures, hath been disforested, and the soil thereof, with the other estates of the Earls of Westmorland, in Teesedale, (Egleston excepted) are now the property of the Earl of Darlington; whose possessions extend from the extremity of the county of Durham, where it adjoins upon the counties of Cumberland and Northumberland, to Piercebridge, in one uninterrupted line; a stretch of country between thirty and forty miles.</P>
<P>The environs of the river abound with the most picturesque and romantic scenes; beautiful falls of water, rocks, and grotesque caverns. About two miles above Middleton, where the river falls in repeated cascades, a bridge, suspended on iron chains, is stretched from rock to rock, over a chasm near sixty feet deep, for the passage of travellers, but particularly for miners: the bridge is seventy feet in length, and little more than two feet broad, with a hand rail on one side, and planked in such a manner, that the traveller experiences all the tremulous motion
<PB N="280" REF="348"/>of the chain, and sees himself suspended over a roaring gulph, on an agitated, restless gang-way, to which few strangers dare trust themselves.</P>
<P>Two miles further up the river, in a retired situation, on the brink of the stream, is a house, the property of the Rev. Mr. Zouch, called <HI>Frier House,</HI> probably built on the site of an old hermitage, the estate being part of the ancient possessions of the monastery of Riveaux; a mile from thence is the great fall of the river, called THE FORCE. The spectacle is truly noble, and the scene august; when the river is increased by heavy rains, it breaks down two channels, that to the north being shelvy, throws the water into sheets of foam; the other being perpendicular, it falls there in one vast spout, from the precipice, eighty-two perpendicular feet, into a deep bason, at once casting forth a prodigious spray, that receives the colours of the rainbow, and stunning the ear with the hollow noise: the rocks form a wide amphitheatre, and being almost perpendicular, shut up the scene with a solemnity and majesty, not to be expressed: the slopes are decorated with hanging woods, the fissures and openings of the cliffs, with creeping shrubs; and ancient yew trees, here and there scatter their solemn green over the grey rocks, or suspend their rusty branches from the precipices. Various openings and grottoes are formed by the fantastic hand of Nature along the northern shore, over which the hanging trees form a verdant canopy; in those recesses, parties of pleasure often dine, and mix their wine with the living fountain, that trills down the rock;—a delightful scene for beauty, song, and wine!</P>
<P>Whoever would seek for wild and beautiful landscape, should trace this river to its source; it must suffice in this work, to point out to the reader one more scene on its channel. About four miles above the Force or waterfall last described,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Itin. v. p. 93. Yade more hath the hede of Tees. Then it takith a course among rokkes, and reseyving divers other small hopes or bekkes, and commith much by wild ground for a 8 or x miles to Egleston bridge, wel archid: then to Barnard Castel bridge, very fair of three arches: then to Perse∣bridge, sum time of 5 arches, but a late made new of three arches. Thens to Crofte bridge 5 miles, and so to Yurkam bridge, a ******* miles, and thens to Stokton, wher is a fery 3 miles, and so a 4 miles to Tesemouth.</NOTE> is a place called the <HI>Caldron Snout,</HI> from its being the mouth of a long canal, where the river sleeps profoundly, and on a sudden pours itself out, over a succession of shelves and falls, for the space of several hundred yards, through a deep opening or gully in the rocks. The grandeur of this scene baffles description; it is not to be expressed in any miniature drawing; the august beauties must be imagined by the reader, accompanied with the idea, that here a large and powerful river is hurried down from steep to steep, for more than two hundred yards, dashed and distracted by opposing rocks, in various directions, and resounding from the lofty shores, that tremble on their thousand columns. Over the deepest and most awful part of the gulph, but where the rocks approach nearest to each other, a bridge is laid, formed of one piece of timber, without any rail; where only passengers, who have a brain befitted to aerial flight, may go without horror: the length of the
<PB N="281" REF="349"/>beam appears to be upwards of forty feet from buttress to buttress. It would be tedious to describe every beautiful scene that is found on the banks of this river from hence to its source; rocks, cascades, and wild shores, follow its course, to the foot of the mountain of Cross-fell, where the first apparent spring flows; in whose environs, in the deep gullies, snow has lain undissolved for many years; as we proved by many strata of herbs and soil, which appeared in succession as deep as we could penetrate.</P>
<P>The country immediately above Middleton rises gradually; on the skirts of the hills, for four miles, there are scattered inclosures, and pretty good lands, of a southern aspect. Newbiggin is the last village northward—beyond the Tees force, the hills rise very swiftly, and there is not a tree to be seen; Nature here is not barren, but neglected; by planting and inclosing, great improvements might be made in the lands; whenever the noble proprietor shall turn his mind to this district, by planting only, immense advantage would accrue to future ages. The barrenest heights pour forth hidden treasures, being rich in mines. In 1781, from the various mines in this district, there was brought to the mills to be smelted, 5617 bings of ore; four bings and a half, upon an average, will produce a fother of lead, weighing 22 cwt.—Each fother yields ten ounces of silver; and about three pounds per fother will win and manufacture the ore, and carry the lead to market; it sold that year for 17 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a fother. Egleston lordship that year produced about sixty bings of ore.—The richest product of silver is from Claregill-head mine, in Cumberland, the lead of which yields 42 ounces to the fother.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author had these notes from Mr. Lancelot Harrison, lately deceased, who brought the shot-casting art in this country to very high perfection.</NOTE></P>
<P>The cattle and sheep of this part of the country are small, the cattle are fed to little more than ten stone per quarter; ewes bred in the dale, when fat, weigh from seven to ten pounds per quarter; and wedders from ten to sixteen pounds a quarter: some in the lower grounds are heavier. This country abounds in sheep; no less than 20,000 are said to be depastured on the common lands yearly. Six fleeces of wool generally go to the stone. The vale is well peopled, on account of the great number of men employed in the mines, who, notwithstanding their labour, are strong limbed and stately, approaching to six feet in height.</P>
<P>On each side of the river, the moors abound with game, and the streams are every where filled with trout: such are the compensations bountiful Nature has yielded for her less seemly exterior countenance.</P>

<P>THE passage from Teesdale into Weardale is difficult, even in the height of summer; the hills are steep, the settles or slacks are mossy and full of dan∣gerous bogs; and the road is pointed out to travellers, by pillars and heaps of stones, placed on eminences. In the worst, or most difficult part of the way, you pass the workings of lead mines, at a place called Pike-Law, which, it is said, produced to the first Earl of Darlington, not less than 10,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year, for several successive years: at the second pillar, or heap of stones, you obtain a sight of Weardale, a narrow vale, pent in by bleak and lofty mountains, but yet chearing to the eye, long wearied in the precarious paths of the ascent. There are a few houses in the depth of the vale, with a chapel of ease to Stanhope; the inclosed lands let for near 40 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> an acre; the farms are small, divided into lots of about 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year, with extensive common right; the lower commons bear a sine short herbage; the higher hills are not so heathy and barren as in the head of Teesdale; and the cattle and sheep are of a superior breed.</P>
<P>Leland in his Itinerary, vol. 8, says, <Q>There is a place in the very head of “Weredale, caullid the Byshop Stones, and there is the limes of the bishoprike.

Henry of “Lancastre and John of Henaude, had thought to have set on the Scottes, but Mortymer, by privy practise lettid them. Mortymer also at the same, by false counsel lettid Thomas Brotherton, Erle Marescal, the King's uncle, to set on the Scottes, in so much that he sent as mareschaul to Henry of Lancastre, and John of Henaude, not to fight withoute his consente.

When the ”young king knew that the Scottes were fled, withowte hurt, he wept tendrely.</Q> Certain it is, the retreat was, for some days, concerted by the Scottish leaders, and a knight was exposed to be taken prisoner, who gave intelligence, that the army had received orders to be under arms to march at night, when the banner of Douglas should be displayed: this information was construed to imply, that ano∣ther attack was determined upon, and the English troops stood all night under arms in battle array; things thus prepared, the fires in the Scotch camp were kept burning, and the voice of multitudes, that was heard at a distance by the out-posts, confirmed the idea of a designed assault; but under covert of a wood, and the interposing mountains, the whole Scottish host filed off, and made good their re∣treat towards Carlisle;<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Smollet et als.</NOTE> which, on the approach of day, was discovered, too late for the English to effect any thing more, than to harrass the rear, which consisted of about 2000 naked men, who, to accelerate their flight, had thrown away their arms and implements. Modern writers have servily adopted Hollingshead's de∣scription of the deserted camp, who, in a stile of romance, not peculiar indeed to his time or nation, tells us, that <Q>as soone as the English men were advertised, “that the Scots were thus departed, they hasted to the place where they had lain encamped, in hopes to have founde some riches, which, for haste, they had left behind them: but at their coming thither, they found nothing but X. M. payre of hieland shoes, which are made of greene hydes of beastes untanned; also they found three hundred hydes of savage beastes set upon stakes, instead of cawdrons, therin to seethe their meate: moreover, they had left behinde them, five hun∣dred dead carkasses of beastes, and sheepe, which, for that they could not drive them away, they killed, to the end the Englishe men shoulde have no gaine by them. There were likewyse founde five Englishe men wyth theyr legges broken, and bound naked unto trees, which were quickly loosed and comitted ”to the cure of chirurgians.</Q> Smollet adds a thousand wooden spits loaden with beef; and Ridpath, not content with this exaggerated tale, which those who view the country, even in this improved age, must sufficiently discover, adds, <Q>the “English saw proofs of that simplicity and hardiness of living, which gave their enemies a superiority to forces far more numerous, but at the same time, more luxurious than themselves. Many carcasses of black cattle, red, and fallow
<PB N="290" REF="356"/>deer, were found, &amp;c.: the rest of their provision consisted of oat-meal, which they were wont to carry in bags behind them, and of which they made a thin paste, that they baked in cakes, by the help of iron plates, trussed in their sad∣dles.”.</Q> This relation, that author takes from Froissart, who, he presumes, had his information from the Flemings; but he well knew, they had no such delicacy of appetite, as to require baking oat-meal on such excursions; and the story is derogatory of the hardiness and military spirit, which prevailed so highly in that heroic age. From the general tenor of the accounts given by historians, and a comparison of circumstances, particularly if we believe the Scotch marched off towards Carlisle, it will be pretty well ascertained, that the vestiges of the camp in Stanhope park, point out the station of the English army.</P>

<PB N="293" REF="359"/>steps to the nave, 28 feet; is handsomely wainscoted and screened with oak, having six stalls on the north and south, and two stalls on each side of the screen-gates. It is lighted by a large window to the east, and two to the south, under pointed arches. There hath formerly been fine painted glass in the chancel windows, of which there remain several fragments of excellent figures, with labels containing their names; the word Zacharias is perfect. There is a large square porch to the north, now filled with seats. The nave is regular, consisting of a centre and two side ailes, formed by rows of three round columns, supporting circular arches, and lighted by three large windows, north and south; and two small ones towards the tower. The nave is in length, 50 feet; and, including the side ailes, in width 40 feet, regularly stalled with oak.</P>
<P>The rectory house is a handsome building, erected by Dr. Hartwell, in the year 1697, as appears by an inscription, placed on the east end.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">W. H. D. D. R S. EXTRVXIT ANNO PACIS EVANGELII 1597. RYSW. ICI. Io.</NOTE> In the garden, a
<PB N="294" REF="360"/>Roman altar is preserved, found about 50 years ago, on Bollihope common in this parish; the inscription runs thus: Silvano invicto sacrum C. Tetius Veturius Micianus praef. Alae Sebosiene, ob aprum eximiae formae captum, quem multi an∣tecessores ejus praedari non potuerunt. Votum solvens, lubenter posuit. Is it possible a boar was such excellent game, that an altar should be raised in comme∣moration of the conquest; it is more probable, and more just to the character of a leader of Roman cavalry, to presume, some enemy of greater consequence was typified by the figure of the boar. In all the Scotch excursions, we find that figure cut on the monuments, to distinguish the northern people; and the situa∣tion of the altar encourages the idea.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of this inscription, Gent. Mag. 1749, October, p. 449.</NOTE></P>
<P>We have already seen what was the customary tenure of lands, in the year 1595, but must have reference to the more antient records, to discover the servility of the original tenures. By the Bolden Buke, it appears there were xx villains in Stanhope, who, each held one oxgang of land, rendering 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> with 16 days works of one man, between Pentecost and Martinmas; each villain led the Lord's corn four days, with one carriage, and made four portions of seed land; mowed two days, when he received a corrody, and made and led the hay, having a loaf on leading days, as well for corn as hay; carried and re-carried, between Stanhope and Wolsingham; and carried the game killed in the forest to Durham and Auck∣land. Moreover, at the great hunt, they erected for the entertainment of the prelate and his suit, a kitchen, larder, and other offices (Canillum, perhaps a dog kennel) and prepared beds or couches for the hall, chapel and chamber; and brought all the provisions for the lodge. Various persons held portions of land on less servile tenure, and some for an annual out-rent. The sons of Gamellus de Rogerley, and others, held lands by the service of providing a man forty days, in the forest at fawning time, and the like at rutting time; and going on messages: others prepared the seed land in autumn. Aldredus the Smith had 12 acres at 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent, and others on various duties. Lambertus the Marble Cutter had thirty acres of land for his stipend, whilst he wrought in the bishop's service. William Wilde, as headborough man, held a toft, a croft, and seven acres of land son his service. All the tenants and villains repaired the mill-dam, and brought the mill∣stones. The Punder had six acres of land, and the customary sheafs of corn, and rendered 40 hens and 400 eggs. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, we find sundry lands specified by name, with the owners, under the title of free tenants. The Bishop's Almoner held 100 acres of land in Rookup at 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent. Newlandside was held by Will. Merley, at 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 9 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent, and Huckleyfield at 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent.—Roger de Dirlton, Bolyopeshele, at 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.—Robert Todd, Horseleyburn-field, at 12 <ABBR>d</ABBR> rent.—Richard Dowy, Moreland, at 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent.—Thomas Marshall, Harlaugh, at 12 <ABBR>d</ABBR> rent.—Thomas Rogerley, Newfield, at 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.—John de Merley, Josyanbanks at 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 3 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.—John Blackhead, Wodcroft, at 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.—Will. Featherstonhalgh, three acres on Callandland, eight acres on Stanforland, and three acres in Feryfeld.—The master of Gretham hospital, held a pasture for cattle on Swynhoplaw. The parson of Stanhope held a close of land, called Migge Close,

<P>Before we take a view of the wider parts of the vale, it is necessary to observe, that the shores of the river and brooks furnish fine meadow grounds; there is some tillage land near Stanhope town, where, in our tour on the 27th of July, wheat was begun to ripen, and oats were full shot; the crops tolerably flush: cattle about Stanhope feed to near seventy stone weight, sheep seventeen pounds a quarter, and fleeces weigh near seven pounds: the sheep kept upon the commons are much smaller. The inhabitants are numerous, robust, and healthy, in so much, that in this extensive parish, the limits of which exceed twenty miles, it has frequently happened there has not been a funeral for eight weeks: five hundred men, not less than five feet ten inches in height, and many above six feet high, may be found in this parish.</P>

Computed number of inhabitants 1080.—Burials last year 36.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>This being a manor of the bishop, the ancient tenure of lands therein was servile: by the Bolden Buke, it appears that the villains held three hundred acres, rendering nine marks; that they cut and carried all the bishop's corn within the manor of Wolsingham, with the help of the lord's bondmen; mowed all the meadows of Bradley, won and led the hay; wrought nine score days at the lord's command, carried six score loads of wood, and prepared the seed land at Brandwood, with all their household, except housewives; prepared four portions of seed land at Wolsingham, when they received a corrody, and when they mowed and carried the hay and corn, they had each a loaf of bread. William Presbyter, and Jacob
<PB N="300" REF="366"/>his son, held lands, rendering a rent in money; Walter Crok for his lands went the bishop's messages, and superintended the villains at mowing and reaping. Others held on the same service. Roger de Bradley held lands in Bradley by service of the forest forty days in fawning time, and forty days in rutting time, and by fencing and keeping Bradley meadows. Roger de Roangers held under the forest service: Ralph the <HI>Beekeeper</HI> held six acres for his service in tending the bees—Adam the Headboroughman had six acres—Henry the <HI>Shepherd</HI> had twelve acres, the <HI>gardner</HI> had five acres, three coroners had seventeen acres, and rendered 3100 <HI>scutelli;</HI> what this implies it is difficult to determine.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tres coronatores xvij acras et reddunt M<SUP>c</SUP>.

<P>It appears to be an error in the record, and we are led to conjecture the word ought to be <HI>coraage,</HI> from whence the service was derived The coroners are officers under the Jura Regalia; and we are informed by the ancient law books, <Q>that there were certain common <HI>Praestations,</HI> which are not called <HI>services,</HI> “neither do they arise from customs, unless some extraordinary occasion happens, or that the king comes: ”such are <HI>hidage, coraage,</HI> and <HI>carvage.</HI></Q> The bishop's presence at Weardale was attended with a multi∣tude of services. This service now treated of appears to have related to <HI>corn measure;</HI> and the Scotales were penny rents, <HI>ad potandum cum Bedello Domini Epi,</HI> a due by custom to foresters, which the coroners collected. This is the best exposition we are able to gather from ancient writers.</P></NOTE> The punder had six acres, and rendered forty hens, and four hundred eggs. The demesne was farmed out, and rendered sixteen chalders of wheat, the like of barley, and seventy chalders of oats. By Bishop Hatfield's Survey, it is stated, that William Jebbeson held the manors of Wyshill, and lands formerly Robert Scot's, and made forest service for the same; viz. forty days in the fawning time, and forty days at rutting time. Others held divers parcels of land, named in the record, John Matthewson, <HI>Spaynesfeld and Fawlees;</HI> Robert Morgan, <HI>Milnlaws;</HI> Thomas, the son of Ada Rogerly, <HI>Ballardsyde;</HI> Robert Egleston, <HI>the manor of Brandwood;</HI> William Jebbeson, <HI>Papworth-ele;</HI> Ralph Eure, <HI>the vill of Brandeley and Sunnyngside, Kittespark and Walkerland;</HI> Thomas Grey, <HI>Newland and Fawlees;</HI> the Lord Nevill, <HI>the vills of Thornley and Greenwell,</HI> formerly the estate of Henry Beaumont, with <HI>Helm-Park and Redmyr;</HI> the Sacrist of Durham, <HI>Landa Dei,</HI> and 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> out of Frosterly; Richard Featherstonhalgh held <HI>the demesne lands;</HI> the Prior of Finchale held forty acres called <HI>Smalleys;</HI> the Custos of the chauntry of Frierside, beside Derwent, held a messuage and twenty-two acres of land; the parson of Brancepeth, for the glebe of his church, paid 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> &amp;c. The service of the cottagers was the carriage of the bishop's hawks, cleaning the manor-house for the reception of the lord and his ministers, assisting to clean the mill pool, and going on the lord's errands; attending the lord's chace, and working at hay. The services of the bond tenants, set out in this record, are nearly similar to those noted in the Bolden Buke; they held amongst them a piece of land called Bradshaw, another piece called Medhop, a pasture called Gosecroft, and twenty acres called Harekar. It is stated, that there was a manor house, with a garden and orchard, and three arces of meadow land appertaining.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rot. B. Hatf. Sch. 6. No. 3.

<P>It was observed before, that Henry de Puteaco or Pudsey, our prelate's nephew of that name, began to found a religious house at Backstaneford, which he was induced to discontinue, or the house was suppressed, when he fixed upon the more eligible situation of Finchale for his pious work.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Sententia Judicum de Backsteneforde.

<P>RANDAL'S MSS.</P></NOTE> In the approach to Wolsingham, the road passes a brook anciently called Backstaneford, near which Mr. Randal places the site of this monastery: in a note, he says, <Q>Opposite “to the church stand some remains of an old monastery, founded by Henry de Puteaco for canons, in the time of Bishop Hugh; but the prior and monks of Durham, at the beginning of the succeeding bishop's time, preferring a suit against the canons, with such expence and labour, that (whether by apostolical ”decree, justice, or policy) they got the canons ejected.</Q> In the place pointed
<PB N="302" REF="368"/>out are the remains of some considerable edifice, of a square form, inclosed with a deep moat: an adjoining ground is called the Chapelgarth. On viewing this place, we noted it as the site of the ancient manor-house of the prelates, particu∣larized in Bishop Hatfield's Survey, to which appertained a garden, orchard, and three acres of demesne land. The figure of the ruins, and the fortification, seem fitted to a building of the latter sort: at a little distance is a house called Bail∣hill-house, or Bailiff's house. Henry's foundation was certainly soon overturned, and it is scarce probable that an edifice destroyed in the latter end of the twelfth century, should now be distinguished, or leave such conspicuous remains to this time, within cultivated lands.</P>
<P>Holbeck House lies to the south-west of Wolsingham, and on the opposite side of the river, in a gloomy situation: it was the ancient seat of the family of Craggs, from whom descended the famous secretary of state of that name: of late years it was the estate and place of residence of John Bowes, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> now of the island of Jersey.</P>
<P>WYSHILL manor, now called WYSERLY, or part thereof, was the estate of Robert Scot, and at the time of taking Bishop Hatfield's Survey, was possessed by William Jebbeson, who held the same by forest service, viz. forty days in the fawning season, and the like time in the rutting season, with suit of court, and 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent.—The family possessed the estate for several generations.</P>
<P>Small Lees, near Wolsingham, 28th April, 13th Henry VIII. was granted by Robert How and his wife to John Hall, to the use of "the church-wark and "ornaments of St. Nicholas's church in Durham."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rudd's MSS temp. Ruthall Ep. Rec.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thornley<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A considerable working colliery at Thornley.</NOTE> and Greenwell, in time of Bishop Hatfield, were part of the possessions of the Nevills, (formerly of Henry Beaumont) who rendered for Thornley 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and for Greenwell 25 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> they continued in the family till the Earl of Westmorland's attainder. Helm-park and Redmyr were also part of the possessions of the same family, and were forfeited under the attainder; for Helm-park was rendered 33 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR></P>
<P>BRADLEY lies in a fine valley, about a mile eastward of Wolsingham: it anciently gave name to a resident family, but before Bishop Hatfield held the see, it became part of the possessions of the Evers of Witton, and, at the time of the prelate's Survey, the vill of Bradley was held by Ralph Euere, as in that record he is written, who rendered for the same 22 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> He held therewith Sunningside, containing 200 acres, at 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>—Kittespark and Walkerland at 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent. It seems that Bradley soon became a favourite seat of the Evers; for in Bishop Langley's time, Sir William obtained licence to embattle and fortify the house. In Bishop Booth's time, Ralph Eure, or Ever, died seized of this manor, and in the first year of Bishop Sherwood, livery was made to his coheiresses, Ann, the wife of Ralph Constable; Isabel, the wife of William Constable; and Ellen, the wife of Henry Thwaites, Ralph's cousins.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rudd's MSS. an. 4 Booth et 1 Sherwood.</NOTE> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Livery to John Graham, and Frances his wife, daughter and heiress of Sir Henry Thwaites, son and heir of Ellen, one of the cousins and heirs of Robert Eure, of Bradley, an. 1 Tunstall.</NOTE> In time of Queen Elizabeth, Bradley was the estate of the
<PB N="303" REF="369"/>Tempests, but how that family derived their title, we have not found; and Robert Tempest, and Michael his son, being attainted of high treason, on account of their being concerned in the northern rebellion, the queen, for certain eminent services, particularly during that rebellion, granted their possessions to Sir George Bowes, of Streatlam, John Hutton and David James; the two latter persons being either trustees for Bowes, or interested in some other branches of the granted estates; for Bradley thenceforth became the estate of the family of Bowes, in which it has continued in a lineal descent to the present owner, Thomas Bowes, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hodgson's MSS.</NOTE></P>
<P>Bradley-Hall has long been neglected; the situation is retired, but romantic; the river winds beautifully down the valley, graced with wooded banks.—The house was an extensive edifice; fortified with deep moats, and a strong curtain wall; the lower apartments are all vaulted: the projection in the front is apparently more modern than the rest of the building, and in a very elegant stile: the centre forms an open saloon, to which there was an approach by a double flight of steps, ascending from the right and left; and the saloon led to two state rooms, of large dimensions. We have no account when this house was dis∣mantled, and the interior parts destroyed: it is now merely a ruin: one would be apt to fix the date of the more modern part of the edifice to the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, from the mode of architecture, used in the new erection; but that it bears similarity to parts of Witton Castle, the principal seat of the Evers; and Bishop Langley's episcopacy, when a licence to embattle was obtained, carries us to King Henry VI.'s time.</P>
<P>NEWLAND and FAWLEES were held together by Thomas de Ebor, who, in the fourteenth year of Bishop Hatfield, died seized thereof, by the title of the manor of Newland cum Fawlees, held of the bishop in capite, by homage and fealty, and 31 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent, with suit of court:<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P><HI>Newcastle Chronicle, 4th April,</HI> 1778.—By the register of this parish, it appears, that there have been no more than four funerals from the 25th of March, 1777, to the 25th of March, 1778. And what is still more remarkable, the ages of three of those persons, added together, amount to 225. A strong testimony of the salubrity of the air. The number of children christened within the same period are 19, and the number of inhabitants upwards of 600.</P>

William Eure, brother of the second Ralph Lord Eure, was a colonel in the army of King Charles I. and was killed at the battle of Marston-Moor, in Yorkshire, A. D. 1645. The last Lord Eure, who was living A. D. 1674, leaving no issue male, that family became extinct. In the time of the civil war, this castle was in the hands of Sir William Darcy. He being a royalist, it was besieged, and taken by Sir Arthur Hazelrigg, Governor of Auckland Castle, who sequestered the goods, but did not destroy the building, which was afterwards demolished by James Lord Darcy, of Havan, in the kingdom of Ireland, about the year 1689, who took away the lead, timber, and chimney-pieces, to Sadberye, near Richmond, with a design to build another house there: but the greatest part of the materials was afterwards sold by auction, for much less than the sum paid for their pulling down and removing, ”&amp;c.</Q> The Greenwells had lands at Witton, in Bishop Hatfield's time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

This is now an insignificant place, lying west of Witton Castle; and as we find no notice taken of it in the more modern records, it is presumed its manerial rights were neglected, or swallowed up in the superior estate of Witton Castle. In the same Survey, it is noted that Robert Hagreston held the manor of Ednesknoll, formerly the estate of Walter de Cheswyk; the present name of this place, if we mistake it not, is Hedgeknoll, lying north-west of Witton Castle, and its privileges have shared the same fate with Fiches.</P>
<P>NORTH BEDBURN lies in this chapelry, part of the ancient possessions of the family of Eures. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, it is set forth, that Robert de Drilleton held the manor of Wadley, formerly the estate of Leon. Heriz, rendering

<P>At the west end of the town of Witton, on a sine elevated situation, stands WITTON-HALL, late the place of residence of Charles Joseph Douglas, a man of uncommon talents, whose origin was not known to his most intimate friends; he had undergone strange vicissitudes of fortune, and rested here for a while in the lap of luxury and ease, to give a new spring for adventures still more unaccountable, and attempts more capricious than he had before experienced: with a most exten∣sive genius, he possessed a spirit of liberality that deserved a better fate than that which he purchased by his follies; but pushed forward by an extravagant vivacity, he was again launched into the world, to ride out new storms and troubled
<PB N="308" REF="378"/>channels.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">He said he was born in one of the West India islands, of parents who were engaged in the cause of the pretender, in 1745—That he had served in the army, and was at the battle of Minden, of which he frequently gave long and very particular accounts. By his marriage with a lady of the name of Douglas, who was the owner of Witton-Hall estate, about 400 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year value, he gained that possession, which was secured to him after her death, by some deed of hers; to qualify him to take which, he proved himself denizen by long-laboured searches for his pedigree in the descents of the noble family of Douglas.—A person who set up a claim to estates and titles in Scotland, under a lineal descent from the great Duncan, and then lived at Doncaster, once told the author that Douglas and he were fellow-waiters at the great tavern in St. Albans.</NOTE> The estate was purchased by John Leaton, <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR> of Snows-Green.—The view from this house is beautiful; the vale opens to the west, where Bedburn brook winds through woody banks, and empties its channel into the Wear; two eminences covered with stately trees rise in the vale, and decorate it beautifully; the winding streams of Wear are seen for a considerable distance, the banks finely varied with groves and meadow grounds, and, to finish the beauties of the landscape, Witton Castle and the park fill the nearer eminence.</P>

<P>The vill of Hamsterly was part of the ancient possessions of the Eures; in Bishop Bury's time, by an inquisition taken on the death of William de Foxcotes,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An. 6 in plen. com. Dun. cor. J. de Menevill vic.

Dun. co. Will. de Mordon, vic. Dun.</NOTE> held there eight messuages and thirty acres of John de Ever, by fealty and one mark rent. The Eures continued in possession for many genera∣tions. The Lumleys and Boyntons also held lands there.—An extensive tract of ground belonging to Hamsterly was called the West-park.</P>
<P>At the south-west etremity of this chapelry lies Lynesac, noted in the Survey, where the Prior of Finkley held lands by foreign service, and 30 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent, and one John Mawe also held lands. Twenty-eight tenants held thirty-five messuages and tenements of the bishop's exchequer lands, under rents certain. The bailiff of Lynesac and Bedburn is a patent officer. The Nevills held lands here, which descended to the unfortunate Earl of Westmorland.</P>
<P>North of the village of Hamsterly lies South Bedburn. The first place named in the Survey is Mayland, which lies west of the village of Hamsterly, then the estate of Hugh de Burninghill, who held the manor by foreign service, and with one hundred acres of land, rendering for the same at the feast of St. Cuthbert, in September, 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> or a pair of spurs: he derived this estate by Isabella his wife, who was the daughter and heiress of Alan de Goldesburg, who died seized thereof, in the time of Hatfield.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. an. 36 Hatf. ap Dun. cor.

<P>Within about three hundred yards of Hare-hope Burn, a small rivulet which rises in the adjoining hills to the north-west, is a singular piece of antiquity, called by the neighbouring people THE CASTLES. At the foot of a high ridge of hills is an inclosure, of an oblong figure, the interior space, an inclining plain, is in length on the south side ninety paces, and on the north eighty-three, and is in width seventy paces; it is defended on every side by a lofty mound or vallum of loose pebble stones, with an outward ditch; no entrance appears but on one side, where the stones are so much fallen in, that it is not easy to form an idea of its original width: at this opening we paced the base of the mound, and sound it to exceed fifteen paces, and the medium height of the ridge was upwards of five yards. On the side where the gate or entrance is, a little stream of water runs down a deep gill or gully, so that nature had rendered that approach more capable of defence; where perhaps a bridge or platform of trees or hurdles, easily removed or destroyed, was used; large oaks and birch trees now grow among the pebbles of the mound; and what is most remarkable, juniper trees are come to a vast strength and stature upon it; such as we have not seen in any other part of the county: the ditches are grown full of brushwood: from the gill or gully the mound looks stupendous, as there it has required the greatest quantity of materials to bring the ridge to the common level of the rest of the work. Whence the pebbles were collected (as the adjacent lands do not seem to furnish such materials) is not easy to conjecture. The interior space appears to have been ploughed in modern times.—The castles lie in the estate of John Leaton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and look upon Hoppiland. It is improbable, from the nature of the adjoining lands, that this work was made for a temporary camp, or in modern times, or even since the country was cleared of wood; as it is so situated that all the surrounding lands overlook it; and an enemy would have had many advantages in assailing and annoying the garrison with missile weapons from the eminences: we presume it was constructed in very remote antiquity. The Roman writers tell us, that Caesar sound the inhabitants of this island dwelling in huts in the midst of thick woods and forests; in strongholds concealed among the mountains: the whole country adjoining <HI>The Castles,</HI> was a forest, and it is but a sew years since the lands were cultivated: this place seems to answer in every particular to the descriptions of the old British strongholds; surrounded with a mound of pebbles, without any cement; in a concealed and secure retreat, covered by hills, and embowered with a thick wood. The place under such circumstances was impregnable: the more distant approach, we may conclude, was through a wood, where, perhaps, one man only at a time could pass, as in the wilds of America; the nearer passes, it is pre∣sumed, would be blockaded by timber trees, felled and piled together in an irregular
<PB REF="381"/>

<HEAD>BRANCEPETH CASTLE S Aspect</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="311" REF="382"/>but intricate manner; then an outward ditch, and after all a wall of loose pebbles, which yielded to the foot of the assailant. At the time we viewed this stronghold, no one could climb the mound, without much danger and fatigue. The interior plain is capable of receiving five hundred huts, as we computed; so that the fort, if it may be so termed, would secure within the vallum, between two and three thousand people, calculating five to a hut, or thereabout.</P>

THE PARISH OF BRANCEPETH.</HEAD>
<P>ADJOINING to the chapelry of Witton, towards the east, lies the parish of Brancepeth.</P>
<P>Leland in his Itinerary, vol. I. p. 80, says— <Q>From Binchester to Braunspeth “4 miles, al by mountaine ground, as is about Akeland, and not fertile of corn, but welle wodid." "As I came by a mile and more to Branspeth, I passid by a ford over Were ryver. The village and castelle of Branspeth stondith on a ”rokky among hills higher than it.</Q> Many conjectures have been made touch∣ing the derivation of the name, and some have given credit to a tradition, that a wild boar haunted the woods of these parts, and made the lofty hill above Brance∣peth his den, from thence called Brawnden; that from his awful track or passage being here, the name of Brawns-path was derived; to reconcile this tradition, it has been said, that the cognizance or arms of Richard of Gloucester was a boar passant, and in contempt of his memory, this place had that appellation, from being his habitation: but such conjectures vanish, when we find in records, above a century prior to the time of Richard, that the place bore the same name. The
<PB N="312" REF="383"/>church is dedicated to St. Brandon;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">St. Brandon was Abbot of Clonfert, in Ireland.—<HI>Vid. Ware's Writers.</HI></NOTE> and under the title of the parish of St. Oswalds, in Durham, we have set forth a record in the time of Bishop Pudsey, in the latter end of the 12th century, in which this place is called <HI>Broun-spittle;</HI> from whence the present name is an easy corruption; but to uphold the appella∣tion of spittle or hospital, the records fail us.</P>
<P>The village of Brancepeth stands about a mile to the west of the river Wear: the castle is on the south of the town, which all authors agree was built by one of the Bulmers, a family of great reputation, and seated here for many generations, but from what early period, we have no information. It has been strongly for∣tified, and defended by a cantonment of towers: Leland in his Itin. vol. I. p. 62. 71, &amp;c. says— <Q>Strongly set and buildid, and hath 2 courtes of high building.— “There is a little mote that hemmith a great piece of the first court.—In this court be 3 towers of logging, and three smaule adornaments.—The pleasure of the castelle is in the 2 court, and entering into it by a great toure, I saw in schochin, in the fronte of it a lion rampaunt.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gules, billette, or; and a lion rampant of the second are the Bulmers arms.—The crest a bull passant.</NOTE> On the southe west part of the castelle cummith doune a little bek out o'the rokkes and hilles not far of."— Sum say that Rafe Nevile, the first Erle of Westmerland, buildid much of this ”house, A. D. 1398.</Q> The Erle that now is hath set a new peace of work to it." Within the works is a spacious area, which you enter from the north by a gate with a portcullis, and defended by two square towers. The area is of no regular figure, and the works which surround it, though very strong, have no distinguishing marks, by which a conjecture can be formed as to their age: the parts now inha∣bited lie on the south-west side of the area, and appear to have been connected by works of various ages; the original plan in that part seems to have consisted of four distinct square towers, whose angles project as buttresses, with a small turret at the top of each angle, hanging on corbles, open at the sides, and not in front. From the gate, on the east side, is a long stretch of wall, with a parapet, which communicates with a large square tower, having projecting angles, turreted like those described; from this tower the wall communicates, at no great distance, with another large tower similar to the last, and thence the wall stretches to the inhabited part of the castle, broken only by a small turret, square in front, but octagonal towards the court: from the gate on the west is a high wall, the parapet in many parts hangs on corbles; where the wall forms angles, it is garnished with small square turrets, on the area side supported by an arch; and in the floor of each is a square aperture to receive materials from persons below, whereby the guard should annoy those who assailed the wall. Towards the north and east the castle has been defended by a moat; to the south and west the walls rise from a rock, nearly forty feet in height, watered by a small brook. The hills to the west are lofty. It is probable the whole fortress consisted originally of a race or scries of towers, of similar form; for the west wall and angular turrets are much more modern than the fortifications on the east. If this conjecture is allowed,
<PB N="313" REF="384"/>then the fortress would contain a cantonment of eight large towers, exclusive of those defending the gateway. One matter, which seems necessary to observe, points out the great antiquity of this castle, that our records furnish us with no licence for fortifying and embattling; which is not the case of any other in the county, except Barnard Castle: and so early as the 27th year of Bishop Hatfield, it is stiled in the records the barony of Brancepeth.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vide Horden.</NOTE> On failure of issue male in Bertram Bulmer,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>A sketillus Bulmer had a son cauillid Bertram, and they were Lords of Branspeth, Berthram had a daughter and heire married to the heire of the Nevilles, and so cam Branspeth to the Nevilles.</P>

Henry the son, in the 17th year of King John, having been in arms with the barons, gave an hundred marks to regain the king's favour; promising future fidelity, and as a security against a relapse, he engaged to forfeit all his possessions; and for performance of his vow, he delivered two hostages, together with his castle of Brancepeth, to be held at the king's pleasure. Henry died without issue in the eleventh year of King Henry III. A. D. 1227, whereupon his sister Isabel became his sole heir. She married Robert Fitz Maldred, Lord of Raby, by whom she had a son, Geoffrey, who, in honour of his mother, so great an inheritrix, assumed the sirname of Nevill; from whom sprang that branch, whose principal seat was for many ages afterwards at Raby; and whose descendants were Earls of Westmorland. The castle and lordship of Brancepeth continued in the Nevill family till forfeited by Charles; Earl of Westmorland; when, by an interposition of the influence of the crown, par∣liament thought proper to take it from the Bishop of Durham, to whom by right of jurisdiction it belonged; and by statute in the 13th of Queen Elizabeth, it was vested in the crown, under the flimsy pretence of indemnifying government against the heavy expences incurred by the rebellion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

He left an only son, William Bellasyse, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who died the 10th of February, 1769, leaving an only daughter, who departed this life on the 6th of April, 1774, and by her will devised the castle, manor, and estates to her kinsman, the present Earl of Faucon∣berg, who sold the same to John Tempest, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>: on that occasion, by advertise∣ment, it appeared that the estate contains 4600 acres, all of freehold tenure, and the rental was then 2134 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> per annum.</P>
<P>The church stands at the south end of the village, near the castle, is in the form of a cross, and beautifully decorated within. The chancel is in length fourteen paces, and in width seven paces, wainscotted and stalled with oak, in an excellent taste, highly finished with tabernacle-work; the roof is pannelled with oak, in diamonds, the joinings ornamented with cherubs crowned, supporting shields, on which are scripture sentences, in raised letters, of fine carving. The space within the rails, to which you ascend by three steps, is four paces wide, and the altar is gracefully covered with crimson velvet. The chancel is divided from the nave by a pointed arch, which is closed by gates and stalls canopied, and ornamented up to the roof, with elegant tabernacle work, in three spires. In the middle of the chancel is a tomb, with effigies cut in wood; the figure of the man is in a coat of mail, the hands elevated with gauntlets, wearing his casque or helmet, which rests on a bull or buffallo's head, a collar round his neck, studded with gems, and on the breast a shield with the arms of Nevill; the female figure has a high crowned bonnet, and the mantle is drawn close over the feet, which rests on two dogs <HI>couchant:</HI> the tomb is ornamented with small figures of ecclesiastics at prayer, but without inscription.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This rectory is dedicated to St. Brandon.

<PB N="316" REF="387"/>of Westmorland, and Margaret his first wife, daughter of Hugh Earl of Stafford: she lies buried here, but he was buried at Staindrop, where there is a fine tomb of him and his two wives, as before observed. As to this earl's failing in issue male, it appears to be an error; to refute which, we beg leave to refer the reader to what
<PB N="317" REF="388"/>is said under Staindrop. There is a large porch to the south of the chancel, opened by an arch, cased with wood, and ornamented with shields of arms: a table monument below, without an inscription: the dexter arms of Nevills, the sinister, argent, three boars heads sable: Leland in the Itinerary, says— <Q>There lyith in “that chapelle on the south side of the quier a Countes of Westmerland, sister to ”Bouth, Archbishop of York.</Q> She was wife to Ralph, the third Earl of Westmorland. In the middle of the porch is a large table monument, without effigy, escucheon, or inscription. Leland tells us— <Q>There lyith in that chapelle “also the Lord Neville, father of the erle that now is. This Lorde Neville died, his father the erle yet lyving: wherapon the erle tok much thought, and dyed at Horneby Castelle, in Richmondshir, and ther is buried in the paroche chirch.

<P>LEL. ITIN. UT SUP.</P></NOTE> The chancel is lighted to the east by a large window of five compartments, to the north three windows, and two to the south, under pointed arches, and ornamented with much tracery: there are two large windows in the porch to the south, and a smaller one to the east, of similar form. The nave is twenty paces in length, with side ailes, each formed by two octagonal pillars, long light shafts, supporting pointed arches; the ceiling is wood, and one of the rafters on the north side is ornamented with a carved figure of a bull bearing a shield, with the arms of Nevill on the left shoulder.—The stalls are of oak, regular, and ornamented with <HI>fleurs de lis:</HI> it is lighted with two old flat arched windows to the north, and three modern windows to the south: the upper windows are square and regular, four on each side. The cross is lighted at each end; the windows under pointed arches. At the north end of the cross, lies a colossian stone recumbent effigy, finely cut, in a coat of mail, and hood of chain-work, the hands elevated, a shield on the left arm, the legs crossed, the right leg uppermost, the feet rested upon a lion: a muzzled bear lies by his left side, and the cushion which supports his head is rested on a group or cluster of lions: the bearings of the shield are the arms of Nevill, with a file of five flambeaux, some modern heralds call the file a label. In ancient authors, and particularly in the book entitled The Accedence of Armorie, it is said this distinction was for the
<PB N="318" REF="389"/>heir of the family, dying in the life time of the grandfather. From this circum∣stance, it is probable this was the monument of one of the Roberts de Nevill.</P>
<P>There were two chauntries in this church, one dedicated to St. John, of which we know no more, than that Browne Willis set forth the names of Henry Statch∣lock and William Cutory, who had pensions of 30 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> each in the year 1553.—Bishop Dudley granted his licence,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rot. Dudley, A. No. 94.</NOTE> dated 20th September, 1483, to Ralph Lord Nevill, and Isabel his wife, to found a chauntry for one chaplain at the altar of Jesus, in the south part of the church of St. Brandon; and to endow the same with ten pounds a year in lands.</P>
<P>The font is a large bason of Stanhope marble.</P>
<P>HAIREHOLM is thus mentioned in the Complete History of Durham, p. 612, <Q>“commonly called Hairum, lies in this parish, whither, it is said, some of the murderers of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, fled after the fact, ”and built a chapel there to his memory.</Q> Our records furnish us with no kind of evidence touching this chapel: the ruined walls of a large building still appear.</P>
<P>HALYWELL lies to the east of Brancepeth, the seat of the family of Reeds, in a fine sequestered situation, surrounded with excellent lands. The first notice we have of this manor, is in the time of Bishop Hatfield, when John Randolf died seized of <Q>the manor of Halywell, in the vill of Brancepeth, held of Ralph de “Neville, Chiv. by fealty and 4 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> rent: also the manor of East Brandon, with lands in Preston on Skerne, held of the Lord Ralph de Neville by half a knight's ”fee.</Q> In John, the male line of that ancient family ceased, and he left three daughters coheiresses, Margaret the wife of William Hee, Johan the wife of William de Elmedon, and Agnes the wife of John Fossour.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. an. 17 Hatf. ap.

<P>It doth not appear that STOCKLEY was ever severed from the chief manor of Brancepeth, it being part of the estate forfeited by the Earl of Westmorland.</P>
<P>WILLINGTON lies south of Brancepeth, a small village, which in the time of Cutheard, second Bishop of Chester, was given by Barnard, a priest, to St. Cuthbert, that he might be admitted one of the fraternity of Durham monastery. Here Henry Mills, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> has a pleasant seat. The family of Bowes had possessions here, but they were soon united with the lare estates of the Nevills, and passed there∣with in the attainder. The vestigia of the Watling-street or Roman road, which leads from Binchester to Lanchester, are distinctly to be traced about half a mile
<PB N="319" REF="390"/>to the westward of Willington. A large column was lately dug up, with an in∣scription thereon; but before a drawing could be obtained, it was squared down and defaced, to make the pillar of a shed for cattle.</P>
<P>THE ROMAN ROAD, &amp;c. Passed through this village. The first possessors of this manor we find named in the records, were Birdons; Roger de Birdon held the same in capite of the bishop, by homage, fealty, and ten shillings rent at the exchequer, and died seized there∣of, leaving John, his son and heir, as appears by an inquisition taken in the 12th year of Bishop Hatfield.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. ap.

<P>CROOK and BILLY-ROW lie to the west of Brancepeth town, and in the book of rates are joined with Stanley. They were ancient members of Brancepeth, and in the inquisitions taken on the death of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, we find a distinction, "of the forest of Crook with Brancepeth."</P>
<P>EAST AND WEST BRANDON also appear in the inquisitions, post mortem, of the Earls of Westmorland.

A search for etymologies often lead into vague conceits; some have conceived the name of Brandon is a corruption of Bury-Dane; but the dedication before-mentioned, perhaps, removes every other more ingenious explication.</P>

The resident family assum∣ed the local name; in Bishop Skirlaw's time, it appears by an inquisition, taken on the death of Hugh de Burninghill, that he died seized of "the vill of Burnynghill, "held of Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, as of his manor of Brancepeth." In 1614, special livery of this manor was granted to Richard Hedworth, son and heir of John Hedworth, as being held of the king, by reason of the attainder of the Earl of Westmorland, and of the manor of Brancepeth.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rudd's MSS. 5th Jan. 1614.</NOTE></P>

<P>CORNSEY AND HEDLEY.—The first evidence we find of Cornsey and Hedley, is in the Bolden Buke, where they are noted to be the estates of Simon the cham∣berlain, he paying two marks rent, and performing the service of carrying the bishop's wine, with twelve oxen, and providing "V cordas" for the bishop's great chace. Bishop Pudsey afterwards, having received a surrender of the premises from the chamberlain, in order that these estates might be granted to Walter de Cadoma, and Robert, the son of Roger, his nephews, grants the same to them under four marcs rent, discharged of all other than the free service of one twen∣tieth part of a knight's fee. In this grant, the chamberlain is stiled "Nepotibus "dilecti filij et familiaris nostri Simonis Camerarij pro servicio, &amp;c." This grant received the confirmation of Bishop Philip de Poictue, and the two instruments were ratified by King John, under the great seal, dated 26th of March, in the first year of his reign. By several conveyances in the 14th century, it appears, that Cornsey, under the distinction of Cornsey-row, gave a local name to its possessor,
<PB N="321" REF="392"/>among whom we find Will-o-the-Raw, and Dionesia-o-the-Raw. We see that the family of De Esh had lands here, and Allan de Esh, then the bishop's forester, took by virtue of the grant of Walter, the son of Hugh de Middleton. In 1480 the family of Taillior or Taillure became purchasers here, and Thomas Taylor of the city of Durham, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> their immediate descendant, yet holds the lands, where he had lately built a handsome mansion house. Will-o-the-Raw, and Dionesia his wife, held a moiety of the manor of Cornsey, by homage and fealty, and the 20th part of a knight's see, paying 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> yearly at the bishop's exchequer. He had also land there, held of the Lord of Hedley, and also eight acres held of the chauntry of the blessed Virgin, in Lanchester church, rendering yearly a pound of wax: they not having issue, the estates descended to Alanus his nephew, son of his bro∣ther, John Bell: it seems that Alanus died under age, and his brother William succeeded, who took the name of Will-o-the-Raw, and forsook that of Bell.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. 5 Hatf. cor.

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF MERRINGTON, WITH WHITWORTH CHAPELRY.</HEAD>
<P>THE next adjoining parish to the south, is Merrington, a member of which is Whitworth, formerly a chapel of ease to Merrington, from whence it is distant about two miles, but by whom, or when severed therefrom, doth not ap∣pear. Here is a small village, with the mansion-house of Robert Shafto, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in a fine situation near the banks of Wear, and opening upon an extensive prospect towards the east.

<P>Number of burials last year, 4.—Computed number of inhabitants, 120.</P></NOTE> In the church-yard are some ancient monu∣ments, one of which, for the singularity of the vizar, is represented in the cut: the other two appear to be designed for female figures rather than ecclesiastics. The arms on the shield (see the cut) are not now borne by any family of the north: the sword being elevated, as was before observed, denoted that the person interred, died during some siege; but neither the arms nor that circumstance lead to any knowledge of whom he was.</P>
<P>By the Bolden Buke, it appears that Thomas de Acley, held this manor by the service of a quarter part of a knight's fee. The resident family soon afterwards assumed the local name of Whytworth; for in the second year of Bishop Bury,
<PB N="323" REF="394"/>by an inquisition taken on the death of Alexander de Whytworth, it is set forth, he died seized in fee of the manor of Whitworth, held of the bishop by homage, fealty, and the service of a quarter part of a knight's fee, suit at the county, and payment of five marks at the exchequer; he also held the manor of Woodham. The family of Farnacres in that prelate's time, held lands under the Lord of Whitworth, by the payment of a pound of pepper for all services. By an inqui∣sition, taken in the eleventh year of Bishop Hatfield, on the death of Alexander de Whitworth, besides the manor of Whitworth, he is said to hold of the priory of Durham, ten messuages and 200 acres of land there, by homage, fealty and 16 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent; John, his brother, was his heir. This John de Whitworth is named in the survey taken by the last named prelate, and therein it is said he held the manor, <HI>p. servic. forin.</HI> with 14 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent, formerly paid by Marm. Muschance, for a certain portion of the manor, rendering yearly iiij <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> xviij <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>. We find no other proprietor named in the records, until Whitworth came into the possession of the Nevills. In 1420, the 19th of September, Bishop Langley granted licence to Ralph Nevill, Earl of Westmorland, to inclose 40 acres of his land in Whitworth; and all the lands he had of the gift and infeofment of Richard del Park in Biers,
<PB N="324" REF="395"/>on the east part of the road, which leads from Binchester, as far as to Willington, and also his woods of Whitworth and Tudhowe to make a park, so that no per∣son should hurt or take game therein without the earl's leave, under a penalty of ten pounds. Whitworth was part of the forfeited estates, under the Earl of West∣morland's attainder.</P>
<P>To the east of Whitworth lies the village of TUDHOE, part of the ancient pos∣sessions of the Nevills. Families of the names of Tesedale and Hoton, held por∣tions of land there, of the lrods of that manor, in very distant times.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. Matilda ux.

<P>Mr. Cade in his tract before noted, says, <Q>It (speaking of Old Durham) has a “better claim to be considered as the <HI>Condercum</HI> of the Romans, from which it is about two miles distant, than the camp near Sunderland bridge (which is evidently of Danish construction) and which the annotator upon Camden says, ”was the opinion of a very great antiquary.</Q> We confess ourselves not well enough informed of the situation of this Roman or Danish camp, to enter into any further discussion of the point, but must leave it to the more fortunate traveller, whose steps may fall upon this historical ground, so confidently reported of by Mr. Cade.</P>
<P>Towards the south-west of Whitworth lies OLD PARK, the seat of Thomas Wharton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> M. D. The first proprietors we find named in the records, are the Kellawes, Richard of that name, dying seized of the manor of Aldpark, which he held of the bishop in capite, by homage, fealty, and the service of the 20th part of a knight's fee, in the eleventh year of Bishop Bury.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. cor.

<P>On a lofty situation to the south-east is Merrington, a long irregular village, lying on the ridge of a hill. On the north side of the town, in a very spacious and open yard, stands the church. Merrington was one of the places granted by William de Carilepho to his monastery of Durham. In Cumin's usurpation of the see, his nephew seized the tower of this church, filled it with armed men, and set about to fortify it with a vallum and ditch; this is the first account we have of the place. The church shews many marks of antiquity. The tower, like that of Jarrow, has stood in the centre of four ailes, forming a cross. The chancel is four paces in width, and five paces within the rails; in the centre of which space, the communion table stands, open on all sides; the ascent is by three steps: from the rails, the chancel is nine paces in length, neatly wainscoted in pannels, &amp;c. stalled with oak on each side, with an open cut screen: the east window of three lights, is under a circular arch; one, of three windows to the south, is now walled up; the arches are pointed: there are no lights to the north. The nave is entered from the chancel by a narrow circular arch. The whole length of the nave, from the screen of the chancel to the west end, is 26 paces, of which the tower takes up nine; but the arches being open under the tower, that part is stalled and forms part of the present space allotted for the congregation. The west side of the tower rises on a heavy circular arch, supported on buttresses; the east side also rises on a circular arch, but it springs from clustered pillars, capitalled in the an∣cient and most rude Saxon form. The body of the church is lighted by one window to the north, under a pointed arch, and another to the south under a circular arch, with an east light: A large porch, called Lawrence's porch, opens to the middle aile by a pointed arch, near 24 feet in span; we could obtain no information why the name of Lawrence was given to this porch, nor could we discover any monu∣ment, or other matter, to lead to it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps the name is modern. Sept. 18th, 1615, Richard Sir George Norroy, king of arms, granted arms to Lawrence Wilkinson, of Ferry Hill. Az. three unicorns, pass. arg. a bend ermine.

The prospect from Merrington church, is at once wonderfully extensive
<PB N="327" REF="398"/>and beautiful. The hill on which this edifice stands, is a ridge or long mount, pointing east and west, and rising with a gradual ascent from the north and south, so as to command the finest landscapes within the county of Durham, expanded to the eye in a kind of bird-eye view, by reason of the loftiness of the mount. The eastern end of the ridge, having its termination near to hills of almost equal emi∣nence, of course affords but a short prospect; the western termination is at the village of Westerton, distant about a mile; the valley, through which runs the river Wear, lies open to the view, graced with the elegant scenes near Bishop Auckland, extended up to Witton, and along the winding passage of the river, almost as far as Wolsingham. To the right you see Brancepeth castle and its en∣virons; to the left, the landscape is bounded by the distant eminence of Cockfield-fell above Raby. To the north, in the bosom of the vale, with majestic aspect, lies the city of Durham, on her seven hills, graced with a variety of woodlands; on every side of the city, villages, seat-houses, and hamlets, are scattered, and the scene is terminated by the mounts of Penshaw and Wardenlaw, which make an elegant break on the horizontal line. To the south-west, the Yorkshire hills above Barningham, form the horizon, southward of which is the spacious plain, where∣in Northallerton and Thirsk lie; and with a glass, it is said, Crake castle and York minster are discoverable; Hamilto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Cleveland hills extend eastward, stretching their cultivated skirts into the vale of Tees; the pike of Roysbury, all the chain of mountains to Hunscliff, and the environs of Flamborough-head are seen, with the Tees mouth, and a wide expanse of sea; on the nearer ground, you view distinctly Sedgefield, Hardwick, and the sweep of country to Elwick and the beacon: then the prospect narrows as you turn northward, and to the left of Quarrington hills, you see Ellermore, Pittington, Sherburn, and many other objects which are beautifully disposed in the valley.</P>
<P>Merrington being parcel of the possessions of the priory of Durham, there is little relative to it in the bishop's records.</P>

<PB N="328" REF="399"/>Scroops and Eures also held small parcels under the convent. It seems that the prior had a park here, for Bishop Nicholas de Farnham granted free warren with∣in the lands of the convent.</P>
<P>GREAT CHILTON<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Capella de Chilton in Paroch. de Merrington, &amp;c.—RANDAL'S MSS.
<P>No traces of either of these chapels were discovered on our view.</P></NOTE> lies to the south-east of Merrington, on an elevated situation: the first account we have of this place, is in the beginning of Bishop Hatfield's episcopacy, when that prelate granted free-warren<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 307.</NOTE> to William de le Pole, in his lands of the isle of Bradbury, Chilton, &amp;c.; and Chilton was part of the forfeitures of Michael de le Pole in 1388,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 321.</NOTE> when the king, to pacify Bishop Skirlaw for his having seized the forfeited lands, granted him the custody thereof. It doth not appear, that the de le Poles held the manor, for by an inquisition taken in the 6th year of Bishop Hatfield, we find Alicia, the wife of John Heron <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> after the death of the Countess of Lincoln without issue, held, with her husband, of the bishop in capite, the manor of Great Chilton, by homage, fealty, and the third part of a knight's fee; and that she left two daughters, her coheiresses; Agnes married to John Boys, the younger, in the countess' life-time, and Idoma, unmar∣ried:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. cor.

<P>LITTLE CHILTON lies a little way to the north; of it we have little information from the records, further than it was called a manor, and was part of the possessions of Alicia Heron, and held in capite of the bishop, by homage, fealty, and the ser∣vice of the third part of a knight's fee, and suit at the county.</P>
<P>HETT lies two miles to the north of Ferry-hill, is a long and irregular village. This being parcel of the possessions of the convent of Durham, little notice is taken thereof in the bishop's records: by an inquisition taken in the 7th year of Bishop Fordham, it appears that it gave name to a resident family, and that William de Hette died seized of the manor of Hette, with a moiety of the vill of Hette, held of the prior and convent of Durham, in capite, by homage, fealty, and suit of court at Durham, and an annual rent of 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> In Bishop Skirlaw's time, this family fell into female issue.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

<HEAD>THE PARISH OF ST. ANDREWS AUCKLAND.</HEAD>
<P>WE now enter the extensive parish of St. Andrews Auckland, being the last to be treated of within the limits of the rivers Tyne and Tees.</P>
<P>The church of St. Andrews is situate on the banks of the river Gaunless, on a fine rising ground, in the midst of a narrow valley; distant from the town of Bishop, or North Auckland, about a mile. This edifice is in the form of a cross, with a tower at the west end. The chancel is in width seven paces, and in length seventeen paces, neatly finished with oak, having fourteen seats or stalls on each side; in the south wall, by the altar, are three niches for officiating priests. The chancel is lighted by six irregular windows to the south, and three to the north; the east window is of five compartments under a pointed arch: by the fragments of coloured glass, it seems the windows were formerly highly deco∣rated; paintings of our Saviour's suffering's still remain in the north windows.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These have lately been removed, and the windows glazed with plain glass.</NOTE> It is separated from the cross aile by a fine pointed arch, with elegant mouldings, rising from brackets.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS.

The north end is lighted by four windows, one to the north, (composed
<PB N="330" REF="401"/>of three compartments) and three to the east; two narrow ones towards the end, the third containing three compartments, and all of them under pointed arches. In the large window to the east, in this limb of the cross, are remains of an inscription painted on the glass; the date appears 1386; beneath the inscription are the arms of Bellasys, and in a belt round them the following words:
<Q><L>"Bellysys Belysys dafe was thy sowell,</L>
<L>"When exchanged Belysys for Henknowell."</L></Q>
This is now called Kennet's Porch. The south limb of the cross is lighted by three windows, one at the end, and two to the east, all consisting of three compart∣ments, and under pointed arches: under the south window is a nich, with water basons. The nave is uniform, having two side ailes, formed by rows of four pillars, the first and third clustered, the intermediate ones octagonal, supporting pointed arches, light and elegant; the nave is in length thirty-four paces, and near twenty paces in width, regularly stalled with oak, and kept in good order. It is lighted by three large windows in the south aile, and two in the north; six windows in the upper range to the south, and five to the north: the tower rises on a pointed arch, springing from pilasters. There is a large gallery at the west end. In the church are two essigies, one in stone of a female, with a square head dress, supposed to be one of the Bellasys; the monument is cut in that kind of soft limestone which is got in the sea banks of Hartlepool, and works like chalk immediately after being brought from the bed, but hardens with time equal to marble; the other is said to be the monument of one of the Pollards; Mr. Pennant describes it <Q>a cross-legged “knight, armed in mail to his fingers ends, with a skirt, formed of stripes, reach∣ing ”to his knees; a short sword and conic helm.</Q> The author of the sepulchral monuments adds,—"Is not this the common plated surcoat?" The hood is united with the vest or waist and sleeves of the mail, and the sleeves are continued, and form the mitts or cover for the hands. The figure is of wood, the right leg
<PB N="331" REF="402"/>is uppermost; the feet rest on a lion; the hands are elevated; and the sword is sheathed. The south porch or entrance has an elegant roof of groined arches, and had three windows, now built up.</P>
<P>Tanner is the Notitia, p. 116, says— <Q>This church or chapel of St. Andrew “here was made collegiate, and well endowed by Anthony Beck, Bishop of ”Durham.</Q> Leland (Colect, vol. I. 123) calls him <HI>Primus Fundator,</HI> and he is reckoned founder by other authors in general: but there seems to have been some foundation here before; for in 1239 Robertus de Courteny habuit literas de presentatione ad decanatum de Aclent ratione vacationis Episcopatus Dunelm. pat. 24 Hen. III. m. 5. The name of Auckland is derived of the Saxon <HI>Ac</HI> or <HI>Ake, Quercus;</HI> and <HI>Ley, Campus,</HI> the field or place of oaks: this place, in old writings, is spelled Akeland, Aucland, Aclent, Acclat, and Acle. Authors have supposed that the prebends of this church, and the churches of Darlington, Easington, and Norton, were founded by Bishop William de Karilepho, by order or assent of Pope Gregory, for the maintenance of those secular canons only, whom he had displaced from the cathedral church of Durham; Leland's expressions on this occasion have been construed to imply, that they had no successors, and that their prebends or portions in those churches expired with them: this may reasonably be supposed in some of the churches, from the total silence of authors about any prebendaries in Easington church in after times: thus we find that Pont∣eland church, in Northumberland, was prebendal about the time of the Lincoln taxation, 1291, after which we hear no more of its being collegiate: nor indeed do we hear of any prebendaries in Norton till about the year 1227, or at Darlington, till Hugh Pudsey's time, who was consecrated Bishop of Durham, 20th December, 1153. But it is certain there were prebendaries here, before Bishop Beck's ordonance for constituting a deanry within this church, and probably they had a succession here from the early period before noted. There is an excellent spirit of piety breathed throughout the prelate's act on this occasion:— <Q>We trust that “our pastoral duty is discharged most suitably to the will of God, when our care extends not only to the procuring of temporal emoluments to his church, but also to the promotion of religion in his people; that while divine service is per∣formed with greater veneration, a more fervent devotion may be excited in the congregation, and that the holy offices, with the ministers, may be acknowledged with greater reverence and honour. Seeing therefor that the collegiate church of St. Andrew of Auckland, in our diocese, is not only greatly decreased in the number of its prebendaries, but in revenue also; and as no canon or prebendary of this church doth either reside himself, or find a proper person to officiate in his stead, though duty and honesty require it, pretending in excuse, that they have no houses there, or sufficient grounds whereon to build: We, &amp;c. with the con∣sent of master Robert de Alberwyke, Vicar, and of all the canons or prebendaries there, do ORDAIN as followeth:—As within the limits of the parish of Auckland, certain new lands of our wastes have been brought into tillage in our time, whereof the tithes are in our disposal, as well by common right, as the custom of the said parish, of such tithes of new or waste lands so brought into tillage beyond Gaundless, in our forest, towards the west, and near Gaundless, in Wydcope
<PB N="332" REF="403"/>Moor, we constitute and ordain a prebend to the amount of ten pounds, con∣ceiving that the said tithes will for ever prove sufficient to answer the same: and because an union of the prerogative of dignity and eminence of person with riches constitutes the highest degree of an excellent office, the name of vicar, which hitherto has been the most eminent in this church, we decree shall for ever be changed to that of dean of the collegiate church, therein not only regarding the late vicar, now the dean thereof, and his successors, but also the ”advancement of that church to higher honours.</Q> A new prebend was annexed to the deanry, and it was thereby ordained, that the dean and his successors should receive all obventions, lands, rents, rights, and liberties, which the vicars formerly had. And also that the dean should constantly reside, and provide a priest to officiate in the prelate's chapel at Auckland.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nova ordinac'o cantarie be. M. Virg. in Eccl.

And as to those prebendaries who neither resided, or furnished proper clerks to officiate in their stead, that all pretence for non-residence might be removed, he appointed a certain parcel of land, lying on the south side of the church, on which they might build; enjoining them by their obedience, that, before the expiration of two years next following, such habitations should be erected. And also ordained, that every canon that did not reside, should provide a proper vicar or curate to officiate in his
<PB N="333" REF="404"/>absence; and that the five first or senior canons, viz. Master Robert Avenell, Walter de Langton, Galfrid de Vesano, John de London, Master Adam de Brompton, and their successors, should engage priests, and pay them annually five marks each, and the four next canons, John de Lacey, Sire Richard de Insula, John de Wytham, and Allan de Kirkham, should engage deacons, with stipends of forty shillings a year each; and the rest of the canons should have subdeacons, with stipends of thirty shillings annually: which curates were to be presented to the dean for his approbation, with certain rules touching their successors. It was also ordained, that divine service should be chaunted all the year round, at the usual hours, after the method used at York and Salisbury, and that high mass should be daily celebrated at the third hour; and also that the mass of the Virgin Mary should be celebrated by Master Adam de Brompton, or his curate, and their successors, at the usual time. And that the presbyters appointed by the dean to inspect more particularly into the affairs of the parish, and all other ministers, should conform to proper habits, and at all times shew obedience. The cu∣rates of the prebendaries were to officiate weekly, according to their different degrees: the dean to regulate all spiritual matters, and to proceed even to the punishment of delinquents. Matins to be said every day for the benefit of the parishioners. The first stall on the south side of the choir was reserved for the bishop; the first stall on the north side was the dean's place; that the canons, whose curates were priests, to hold the next places; after them the canons, whose curates were deacons; and lastly the canons, whose curates were subdeacons: and that the same order should be held in processions.

RANDAL'S MSS.</P></NOTE> In the English Monasticon, p. 348, the reform made by Bishop
<PB N="334" REF="405"/>Langley, A. D. 1228, is thus noted— <Q>As the times were altered, the aforesaid “allowances for the vicars were not sufficient for their maintenance, and therefore none that were fit for it could be found to serve the same; that still some of the prebends were sufficient to bear double their expence; others could scarce do it, and some not at all; therefore he resolved to amend the same. Accordingly the revenues of the three prebends of Bishop Auckland, Eldon the Greater, and Eldon the Lesser, being each of them 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum, he ordained, that as they
<PB N="335" REF="406"/>became vacant, each of them should be divided into two prebends, so to con∣stitute six, and the revenues of each to be equally divided between the two possessors. There being also seven prebends belonging to the said church, whose produce was not sufficient, he directed that they should be joined, so as to make but three prebends, one of them worth 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and each of the other two only 100 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> per annum. He ordained, that the priestly canons, not being resident, should allow their vicars ten marks a year; the deacon canons their vicars seven marks at least; and the canons subdeacons to theirs five marks. These vicars to be satisfied with their said allowances, without being beneficed elsewhere. The canons to provide habitations for themselves and their vicars, on the ground ”allotted them.</Q> The rest of the statutes relating to the divine service, &amp;c. as in other collegiate churches. This instrument was signed and sealed in the chapel at Stockton, the 20th day of September, 1428, the eleventh year of the papacy of Martin V. and the 23d year of the prelate's consecration.</P>
<P>This church suffered in the great dissolution that took place in the first year of King Edward VI. A. D. 1547, and was left neither rectorial nor vicarial, but became a donative, or curacy, very meanly provided for, considering the parish was so opulent, extensive, and populous, and remains so this time: Bishop Cosin's grant of a moiety of the Prebend of Bondgate, making a considerable part of the present revenue. The last dean had a pension granted him of 50 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, which, it appears, was paid him in 1553.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willis's Abbies.</NOTE></P>

<P>Close adjoining to the church of St. Andrews, on the west, lies HENKNOLL: in the old records this is called a manor; and in the fifth year of Bishop Hatfield, Galfrid de Henknoll died seized thereof, as being held of the bishop in capite, by homage, fealty, suit at the county, and eight shillings and sixpence rent at the exchequer; he left Margaret, his daughter and heir. Soon after his time Henknoll became part of the possessions of the convent of Durham, and a licence was had to enable the convent to exchange the same with John de Balasys for
<PB N="337" REF="408"/>Belasys, and lands in Wolviston. The exchange was favourable to the church; John having made a vow to go upon the crusades, and a strong affection for his native place of Belasys prevailing, likely to stagger his resolution, he determined to shake off that yoke, root out partialities, and part with the estate of his ancestors, the regard for which stood in competition with his imaginary virtues. The exchange took place in the year 1380.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HENKNOWL. Petrus reddit de villa sua de Henknowl viij<SUP>s</SUP>. et invenit iiij boves ad vinum quadri∣gand. —BOLDEN BUKE.

</TABLE></P></NOTE> In an inquisition post mortem, taken in
<PB N="338" REF="409"/>the 23d year of Bishop Langley, on the death of Robert Belasys, it appears that John Belasys, in the seventh year of King Henry IV. settled the manor of Henknoll, with lands in Shildon, North Auckland, and Ushaw Moor, to the said Robert, and the heirs of his body, by Johan his wife; and that they had issue William, their heir. In 1572, in the court of Bishop Booth, William Belasys levied a fine of the manor of Henknoll, and others, his lands in this county, and by deed inrolled in the court of Chancery at Durham, on the 24th of January, in the 2d year of Bishop Dudley's pontificate, A. D. 1577, the same were limited to Thomas his son, and the heirs male of his body; remainder to William, another son, and the heirs male of his body; remainder to Robert, another son, and the heirs male of his body; remainder to Galfrid, another son, and the heirs male of his body; remainder to the right heirs of William the father.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot. B. Dudley indorso.</NOTE> Henknoll has continued in the family ever since, and is now the possession of Lord Fauconberg.</P>
<P>WESTERTON is a small-village on the ridge of the hill before described, in the view from Merrington, lying about a mile to the north-east of Bishop Auckland: here Mr. Wright, of Byers Green, built a lofty round tower, for an observatory. Of this place we find nothing memorable in the records.</P>
<P>MIDDLESTON is a small village to the east, on the same ridge of hill. Of this place also the records prove barren; the convent, and now the dean and chapter, having considerable tracts of land here under their tenure.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide schedules to the ch. of Durham, called the Book of Revenues.

<P>COUNDON, a small village, lies to the south of Westerton about half a mile. The Bolden Buke notes this place; that in Little Coundon there were twelve cottagers, who each held six acres of land, and wrought two days in the week from St. Peter's day to Martinmas, and the rest of the year one day in the week; that each made four portions of land, and rendered a hen and one hundred eggs. The demesne lands of Great Coundon containing six carucates of land, with the pasture and sheep were then in the bishop's hands. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, it appears that there were four free tenants, who held five messuages and forty acres of land, rendering three-pence per acre. The demesne was then let out, one Hopper held a messuage and twenty-three acres and one rood of land, paying 23 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and twelve others held an hundred and seventy acres, at one shilling an acre, and there re∣mained eighteen acres in the bishop's hands. William de Coundon, chaplain, he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a cottage and six acres. It also appears that there were then seventeen cottages, with ninety-nine acres of land, held by nine cottagers, half a cottage excepted, then waste, and their services were similar to those set forth in the Bolden Buke, save that the hens are numbered at thirty-six, and the eggs one thousand eight

<PB N="339" REF="413"/>hundred. The exchequer lands were small: and there was a forge, and also a furnace, held at 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent. There is a valor of the Grange, in which all the plots of ground are mentioned, with the number of acres in each, containing in the whole three hundred and eighty acres. The small portion of freehold land affords us little matter worthy notice in the remaining records; we find the families of Padecocks and Bracks there; and the Hotons were possessed of Coundon. The Hoppers were the most ancient family resident here; the possessed Howledge, now the seat of the Agnews; but, falling into female issue, the heiress married one Nicholson, whose only daughter and heiress, Elizabeth, intermarrying with Humphrey Doubleday, of Butterby, carried with her the possessions of the two families, which centred in her: she survived her husband, and sold Howledge, now the seat of the Agnews; her issue still retain considerable possessions at Coundon. The prospect from Coundon Grange is extensive and beautiful, com∣manding the valley in which the Aucklands are seated, and a long stretch of the vale of Wear.</P>
<P>To the east of Howledge lies WINDLESTON, the mansion of Sir John Eden, Baronet, seated on an easy inclination of the hill, with an eastern aspect. This family appears to have been resident at Windleston from about the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign. In early times, this estate was divided in many families; part came to the Edens by the settlement after mentioned; and, by the industry and attention of the family, other parts were gathered together at various periods. Bishop Bury gave licence to David de Holgrave, and Ellen his wife, to grant fifteen messuages and fifteen oxgangs of land in Windleston, to a chaplain for performing daily offices for ever in the church of Bothal, in Northumberland, for the souls of their parents and ancestors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rot.

<P>The manor was lately held by the heirs of John Morland, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and was pur∣chased by one of the Eden family. In the 5th year of Bishop Langley, Robert de Ogle the elder died seized of seven messuages and thirteen oxgangs of land in Windleston, held of Robert Menville in socage, rendering 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. an. 5 Langley.</NOTE> In the 16th year of King Henry VIII.

Lord Ogle sold other possessions in Windleston in the eight year of the same reign to William Richardson, who, in the 4th year of King Edw. VI. sold to one Hindmer; and he, in the 10th year of Queen Elizabeth, sold to John Eden, of Belsis,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Held of the P. of Durh. vid. Book of Revenues.</NOTE> and his heirs. One Thomas
<PB N="340" REF="414"/>Martin was also seized of lands there, which, in the 12th year of Henry VIII. he sold to William Wren, from whom they came to Busby, and from Busby to John Eden. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, John Lord Lumley was seized of a messuage and five oxgangs and upwards of land there; and in the fourth year of the same reign, he conveyed the same in fee simple to Richard Chambre, who, in the 11th year of that reign, conveyed to Peter Maddison, and he, in the 19th year, conveyed to John Eden, of Belsis, and his heirs. Other part of Windleston be∣longed to Neesham monastery; and, being purchased from the crown, was con∣veyed, 1635, by one Robert Stevenson to Robert Eden, of Windleston, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in fee, who, in the 14th year of James I. settled Windleston, on his son Robert's marriage with Ann Bee, and Robert again settled the estate upon his son John's marriage with Katharine Layton, and John settled the estate on his son Robert, on his marriage with Margaret Lambton, and Sir Robert settled the same on his son Sir John, on his marriage with Katharine Shafto, and Sir John settled the same on his son Sir Robert, on his marriage with Mary Davison, from whom it descended to their eldest son Sir John Eden, the present possessor.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The Eures anciently h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld lands here under the priory of Durham.

<P>Southward of Howledge lies the village of ELDON, on a lofty situation. This is one of the places before remarked to be given to the church of Durham by Canute, on his pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Cuthbert. How the manor was severed from the church, or whether Canute's grant extended merely to part of the lands which came to Lord Seaforth by marriage of the heirs of **** Kenith, we know not; the manor, with the whole vill, was part of the possessions of the Nevills: was afterwards the estate of Lady Kenmuire, and now is the property of Sir John Scott, temp. chancellor of this county palatine.</P>
<P>The village of MIDRIDGE lies a little distance towards the south of Eldon. We find few tenants in capite here; in Bishop Bury's time, Thomas Midridge held a messuage and twenty acres of land, rendering 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> at the exchequer, and by the service of mowing at Midridge Grange, or paying a penny yearly; carrying mill∣stones to Kempil mill, if required; grinding there, and rendering also <HI>unam wed∣henne.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whether this duty or payment was the ancient <HI>witerden</HI> of the Saxons, and the form of writing the word only altered by an incorrect scribe, we cannot determine.</NOTE> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inq p. m. an. xi Bury.</NOTE> We find several other families holding small parcels of land in capite, among which are the Heighingtons, who held fifteen acres, by mowing, making and carrying the lord's hay to his grange at Midridge, together with three hundred acres held of the bishop in bond tenure.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m.

<P>South-east from Midridge lies EAST, or OLD THICKLEY, thus distinguished, as there is a farmhold, at the distance of about two miles westward, called West Thickley: it is also called Thickley Punchardon. The Bolden Buke denotes that it was anciently severed from the manor of Redworth, and rendered a mark yearly at the feast of St. Cuthbert, in September, for cornage. Hatfield's Survey informs
<PB N="341" REF="415"/>us that William Lilburn then held it in right of his wife. It continued in that family for several generations, and was the object of great contention in law be∣tween Ralph Claxton and Richard Lilburn, in the year 1638, when, in a writ of right prosecuted in the court of pleas at Durham before Judge Berkley, battle was waged.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vid. Rushworth's Col. part II. p. 788, &amp;c. where is a statement of the several proceedings. The bat∣tons, &amp;c. are in the custody of the family of the late Mr. Ralph Hodgson, whose MSS. are so frequently noted in this work. A full copy of all the proceedings, is in the Collection of Mr. George Pearson, who, in his liberality, would have permitted extracts to have been published, but they would have appeared too prolix in this place.</NOTE> The battle was suspended upon a point which arose in the proceedings, and occasioned the matter to come before the king in council, from whence it was referred to the opinion of the judges, Branston, Chief Justice, Devenport, Ch. Baron Denham, Hutton, Jones, Cook, and others, who gave opinion against the exception; but we do not find that the proceeding went further. The champions appeared in court in array, and cast their gauntlets, their weapons were battons, with sand bags: and such were the barbarous customs even of so late an aera, that the decision of a title to lands was left to Heaven, under the bastings of a quarter staff. Richard Lilburn was the father of the famous Lieutenant Colonel John Lilburn, who was so conspicuous a character in the time of Cromwell's usurpation. The colonel was born at Thickley, in the year 1618,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The family burial ground in St. Andrew's church, called Lilburn's Porch.</NOTE> but being a younger son, was designed for trade: his history and sufferings are too well known to require repetition in this place: it is sufficient to note, that he distinguished himself as a soldier, at the battles of Edgehill, Brentford, and Marston Moor, in the parliament army: and, as a writer, he was publicly acknowleded, in the political as well as puritanical character, with applause: notwithstanding some few errors apparent in his opinions, his memory is sweet to the lovers of liberty and their country, for the bold, virtuous, and distinguished manner in which, upon his trial, he defended that jewel on the hand of English liberty, that constellation that shines on our happy shores, that star of our safety—the authority of juries: his words are re∣peated to us— <Q>The jury by law <HI>are not only judges of the fact, but of the law also;</HI> “and you that call yourselves <HI>judges of law,</HI> are no more <HI>but Norman intruders;</HI> ”and, in truth, if <HI>the jury please,</HI> are no more <HI>but ciphers, to pronounce their verdict.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Trial, p. 107.</NOTE> In this enlightened age, foreigners would not conceive it possible, that this gem of our constitution would be again brought into question: it was not to be wondered at, under the precedency of Lord Commissioner Keble: in other circumstances, how different is our day, to that most horrible period of our history. This great man died at Eltham, on the 29th of August, 1657, in the 39th year of his age, and was interred at the new burial ground in Moorfields. John Lilburn is described to us as a man of a most undaunted spirit, irreproachable in his private life, and, with a warmth bordering on enthusiasm, attached to the cause of liberty. Many writers represented him to be a man of a contentious and quarrelsome tem∣per; and Sir Henry Martin, it is said, spoke of him reproachfully, as <Q>if there were none living but him, John would be against Lilburn, and Lilburn against ”John.</Q> It seems neither of the enraged parties could do him justice, he was not the dupe of either; he opposed the illegal exertions of prerogative, as well as
<PB N="342" REF="416"/>the unjust exercise of parliamentary power; but in both was consistent, opposing tyranny, in whatever form it appeared; and, on a fair review, under an unprejudiced eye, it is apprehended he would be found very seldom in an error.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Richard, the father of John Lilburn, had three sons, Robert, John, and Henry; Robert was a Colonel of Horse, in 1645, Governor of Newcastle the two following years, and, after the king's death, Major General of the North of England.— He had his name put into the list of the king's judges, and actually sat upon the bench at his trial and condemnation, for which he was tried and attainted after the restora∣tion, whilst his father was living. The estate at Thickley devolved upon Robert's children, by his wife Margaret, daughter of Henry Beke, of Hadenham, in Bucks, Gent. which were Robert born 1650, Richard born 1652, Ephraim born 1662, all which were living in 1688, and their father, the Major General, being banished to the island of St. Nicholas, near Plymouth, spending the remainder of his life in that confinement, and dying there in 1665, aged 52 years, or thereabouts; was buried, as his son Richard believed, at Plymouth.

<P>The village of SHILDON lies to the north-west of Thickley. The Belafyses held lands here with Henknoll, thus mentioned in an inquisition post mortem, taken in the 15th year of Bishop Langley, on the death of Robert Belasys. The manor of Henknoll, with its appurtenances, six acres of land in North Auckland, called the Moor Close, held of the bishop by foreign service, service at the county at three head days, 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent at the exchequer, and carrying the bishop's corn with four oxen. A parcel of land called Coldwellfield, with a meadow thereto belonging, on the west side of the river Gaunless, besides the fields of Henknoll, held of William Lilburn, as of the manor of Shildon, by the service of rendering <HI>unius catapulte</HI> yearly: the first instance we have met with in the records of a catapult being provided. Another parcel of land in Shildon, called Copycroche, held of Ralph Earl of Westmorland, as of the manor of Shildon. Also a messuage and fifteen acres of land and meadow in Shildon, held of the Prioress of Neceham.</P>
<P>After crossing the Roman road which leads from Piercebridge to Binchester, BRUSLETON TOWER attacts the traveller's notice, a pleasure house built by the late Mr. Carr, of St. Helen's Auckland, on an eminence so lofty, that it is said to com∣mand a view of the Eastern and Western oceans. WESTILE and BILDERSHAW lie to the southward, of which places we find nothing remarkable. To the west is LUTRINGTON, within the chapelry of St. Helen Auckland. This is one of the places said to be given to the church of Durham by Canute, on his pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Cuthbert. It gave name to the resident family before the Bolden Buke was made, and therein we find that Galterus de Lutrington rendered for his vill of Lutrington 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> made up three portions of land in autumn with all his men, except those of his household, served the bishop as an emissary, provided four oxen to draw the prelate's wine, and attended the great chace.

Also held a place called the Fryth, in West Auckland Moor, a messuage, and twenty-four acres of land in Cockfield; also held of John Heron, and Elizabeth his wife, sixty acres of land in Hilton, rendering a rose; and also held of William and Robert de Wakerfield ten acres of land in Stotlem. In an inquisition taken in the time of Bishop Booth, on the death of William Bowes, Knight, Lutrington
<PB N="344" REF="418"/>is described to consist of one messuage, two hundred acres of land, one hundred acres of pasture, and 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> free-rents, paid by various free tenants, together with a messuage, twenty acres of land, and four of pasture there, theretofore the estate of Thomas Barbon. In Bishop Barnes's time, we find a pardon granted for the alienation of the manor of Lutrington, by Sir Cuthbert Collingwood, and Dorothy his wife, to George Tonge, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> dated the 20th of September, in the second year of that pontificate. In Bishop Hatfield's time, John de Langton<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. an. 6<SUP>o</SUP>.

Other small proprietors appear named in the records.</P>
<P>Of LUFTHOUSE we find nothing remarkable, or of BOLTON GARTHS, being inconsiderable farms.</P>
<P>To the north lies the village of WEST AUCKLAND, which is noted in Bolden Buke to have eighteen villains, who held each an oxgang of land, providing three men weekly in autumn to win and lead the hay, during which service they had a corody, each led corn two days, and together they provided eighteen hens, nine score eggs, one milch cow, and made three carryings between Tyne and Tees. William Coupman and others held divers parcels of land, under certain rents, and the services of ploughing and harrowing the lord's lands, making hay, preparing ridges of fallow in autumn,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Porcationes.</NOTE> and served as emissaries. Elstan a Drenge held four oxgangs of land, made four portions in autumn with all his men, except those of his household, ploughed and harrowed two acres, served as emissary be∣tween Tyne and Tees, and provided four oxen to draw the bishop's wine. It appears that the lands were in the bishop's hands during the minority of the heir, a portion thereof being assigned to the mother for his maintenance. All the villains of Aucklandshire, viz. of North Auckland, West Auckland, Escomb, and Newton, provided for the bishop's chace, for each oxgang of land, one cord, assisted to build the bishop's hall in the forest, with a butler's room, a <HI>dispensa,</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">From Dispensator.</NOTE> perhaps a steward's room, a chamber, and privy, besides a chapel of the dimension stipulated, and a portion of the paling, hedge, or sence, around the lodge: they were intitled to 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> and, on the bishop's quitting the forest, to a full tun or half a tun of beer, if so much remained. They were to keep the hawk-yard, as we ap∣prehend the service to be, from the obscure expression used in the record, and were intitled to make eighteen booths at St. Cuthbert's fairs.

The estate descended to Robert Dalton, his cousin and heir, who, by settlement, limited the same to the heirs of the bodies of John Hutton, and Elizabeth his wife. 29th July, 33d Elizabeth, William Tailboys, of West Auckland, and Jane his wife, by fine, conveyed in trust to John Eden, William Eden, and Ralph Eden, sons of Jane, the manor of West Auckland, and all their lands there, and in Evenwood, Gateshead, and Wolsingham, to the use of John Eden in tail male; remainder to William in tail male; remainder to Ralph; remainder to Jane, with remainder to John in see simple; from which proprietors this estate, with the ancient mansion house, descended to the present owner, Sir John Eden, Bart.—There is an ancient mansion at West Auckland, with a con∣siderable estate appertaining thereto, belonging to Fenwick Wilson, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Borough-Hall, in Westmorland.</P>
<P>Two miles towards the west lies the village of EVENWOOD. This place is distinguished by the names of Evenwood and the Barony; but when it obtained the appellation of Barony, our records are silent; neither do we find any exercise of special privileges here, except such are appendant to a manor and park of the bishop. Evenwood was one of the places said to be given to the church of Durham by Canute, at the time of his pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Cuthbert; how the church came to be divested thereof, we know not; but it was the estate of the Hansards, and by John Hansard was conveyed to Bishop Beck, who is said
<PB N="338" REF="420"/>to appropriate it to the church of Durham; but rather he annexed it to the posses∣sions of the see. Our records inform us, that, at the bishop's instance, John de Lythege, and Alice his wife, granted to John Hansard their manor of Werkersale, and in consideration for the same, Hansard granted his manor of Evenwood and Fuley to Beck, and the bishop made compensation to Lythege and his wife, by granting to them forty pounds per annum for their lives out of the manor of Allerton. Bishop Beaumont granted the manor to Lord Ralph de Nevill for life in the year 1331. He also granted one hundred and forty acres of moor and waste land there to William, the son of William Denum. In Bishop Hatfield's Survey, we find the names of several persons who held lands at Evenwood; the Lord Nevill held the Colt Park, of the inheritance of John de Evenwood, John de Sadberg held a capital messuage with lands there, Hugh Willison held lands and tenements, for which he rendered an arrow. Thomas Hansard held the barony tofts, rendering three arrows. In 1368, the last-named prelate granted for a term of years a blomestage, bloomery, or iron furnace, in Gordon and Evenwood Park, at the rent of 16 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> a week,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Indenture dat. 18th Jul. 1368.

By the survey taken in 1646, and delivered into the Register Office 25th May, in the succeeding year, it is stated— <Q>There hath been a goodly house, called the Barony, “but the same was then utterly decayed, and had so been for many years.

That within the manor or barony lie the townships of Killerby, Evenwood, and West Auckland. That there is belonging to the aforesaid barony a great common or waste, called Raley-fell, on which cattle are put without stint; but there is no wood on the same, nor any in the barony.— There is a great colliery within the manor, called Thorne, in lease from the bishop for lives, at the rent of 70 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> let to one Mr. Drake, who hath assigned to Mr. Charles Vane, and Mr. Thomas Bowes, for 350 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, Mr. Drake paying the bishop's rent.

<P>To the north-east of West Auckland half a mile, lies the village of ST. HELEN AUCKLAND, a name derived from the dedication of the church.

That also since the dissolution there has been a curate or chaplain in the said church, who successively received the said tithes of the garths, till about the 13th of January, 1615, when Anthony Cradock purchasing the said prebend, and all tithes and appurtenances, instantly made claim of the said tithes, being most of the curate's allowance and livelihood, which he had for serving the cure of a very populous parish. This suit was commenced 9th September, 1633,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">It was proved in court, that there were eight hundred communicants in this parish, and that fifteen curates had constantly and quietly taken and enjoyed the tithes of the garths, and that the yearly value of the said tithes was not above 4 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a-year, being the greatest part of the curate's maintenance.</NOTE> and reserved for trial in the court of pleas, but by consent was referred to the award of Charles Leaver, of Heighington, Clerk, and Robert Thompson, schoolmaster of Auckland, who awarded that the tithes should be paid to the complainant.</P>

<P>Opposite to Escomb, on the northern banks of the river, stands NEWTON CAP, the beautiful seat of the family of Bacons, on a sine lofty situation, commanding a prospect of the town of Bishop Auckland, with the bishop's palace and park, Binchester, the seat of Farrer Wren, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and the delightful scenes on the borders of the river Wear. The approach from Bishop Auckland is by a stone bridge of two eliptical arches, remarkable for its excellent architecture. The accounts we have of this place are very obscure, by reason of the number of places in this county of the name of Newton. In the Bolden Buke it is stated, there were thirteen villains in Newton, whose services were similar to those of North Auckland. In Bishop Hatfield's Survcy there are but two inconsiderable free tenants named.— The bond tenants held a common forge, furnace, and kiln, and they rendered for one milch cow at Martinmas 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> for aver-pennies 8 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> for cornage 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 7 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and for each oxgang of land a hen at the nativity, and ten eggs at Easter, in all thirteen hens and six score and ten eggs. The exchequer lands let at a certain rent, were very considerable, consisting of forty tenements, and seventy-two parcels of land.</P>
<P>To the north lies BIRTLEY, an ancient forest or park of the bishops, now inclo∣sed and cultivated; of which we have spoken in the first volume of this work. S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill more northward lie HUNWICK and HELMEDON; touching the latter there is some confusion in the records from the similarity of the name in the old modes of
<PB N="344" REF="426"/>writing Homeldon and Elmedon. Hunwick was held anciently by the family of Binchester, and so is noted in the Bolden Buke. Bishop Hatfield's Survey notes no servile tenure; the exchequer lands were held under certain rents. We are not more happy in our searches in the inquisitions, for they only point out to us the names of the persons who held estates, but without shewing a regular succession of proprietors. Emma, the widow of Emice de Skoweland, in the 36th of Bishop Hatfield, died seized of a moiety of the manor of Helmydon, held of the bishop in capite, by homage, fealty, and 29 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> rent. Also a moiety of eight messuages, and twenty-nine acres of land in Hunwick, held of the Lord of Binchester. She left a daughter Matilda, of the age of fourteen years, her sole heiress. In Bishop Skirlaw's time,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Inq. p. m. x Skirlaw.</NOTE> John de Byrden the elder was seized by curtesy in right of Alice his wife, daughter of Roger de Byrden, of five messuages, three tofts, and one hundred and twenty-four acres of land in Hunwyk, held of Ralph de Nevill, Earl of Westmorland, by fealty, and 4 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> rent. Also a messuage, seventy acres of land, and ten of wood, and the site of a water-mill in Helmedon, held of the bishop in capite by military service. In Bishop Langley's time the Huttons held many lands at Hunwick, and John Hoton, in the 15th year of that prelate died seized of the vill of Hunwick, with its appurtenances, which, with the manor of Binchester, he held of the bishop in capite, by the fourth part of a knight's fee; and in Bishop Barnes's time we find a record of the homage of Anthony Hutton for Hunwick.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rudd's MSS.</NOTE> The family of Eures also possessed lands there; and the Nevills had a considerable property,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 mess. 2 bov. ter. in Hunwick. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Inq. p. m. R. Com. West. an. xx Lang.</NOTE> which came under the forfeiture.</P>
<P>On the opposite side of the river Wear, to the east, is BYERS and BYERS GREEN. Bishop Hatfield's Survey conveys no other particular information touching these places, than that Richard de Park held in Byers Geffrey certain lands; this being under the title of Byer's Green, seems to point out the more ancient name: he is named as the sole free tenant of Byers, where he held one manor-house and two carucates of land by foreign service, and a rent of 35 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 2 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Also a meadow called Knightfield, formerly John Penreths. The cottagers performed no work, and were under certain rents, as were the tenants of exchequer lands. Byers was part of the possessions of the Nevills, and in 1430, was included in the bishop's pardon for alienating without licence;<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Madox's Form. p. 331.</NOTE> which alienation was calculated for the purpose of making a family settlement.</P>
<P>Of NEWFIELD and HERMITHEUGH we find nothing remarkable; there hath not come to our notice any circumstances which relate to the manor of the latter place.</P>
<P>Returning towards the south is BINCHESTER, the manor and seat of Farrer Wren, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> It is a place of great antiquity, and by antiquaries of the first character, said to be the Vinovium of Antoninus, and the Binovium of Ptolemy. Horsley, speak∣ing of Binchester, says— <Q>Ptolemy reckons Binchester among the considerable “cities, and calls it<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, though he has set it a great deal out of its place; the station has been large, and nearly equal to that at Lanchester. The river Wear makes a remarkable turn, and so happens to run almost east and west, and to lie
<PB N="345" REF="427"/>nearly south from the station; though Binchester be in the general on the south side of the river. The out buildings, as usual, have been between the station and the river, or to the south-west of the station. Dr. Hunter said he observed a military way going off from Watling-street near this place, which he supposed went to Chester on the Street: he traced it to Brancepeth park, but could find ”it no further.</Q> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Horsley's Brit. Rom. p. 295.
<P>"Several Roman antiquities have been found here, as coins called Binchester pennies, urns and a cornelian. Dr. Hunter is of opinion, that there has also been a considerable pottery at this place. He has several pieces of pots found here, with some imperfect figures on them, and one piece had AMANDVS (probably the name of the potter) inscribed, which is now in the possession of the Earl of Oxford. The following Roman altars have been dug up here.</P>
<P><HI>Deahus Matribus Quintus Lucius Quinti filius Claudia (tribu) Quintianus beneficiarius consulis votune solvit libens merito.</HI></P>
<P>This is built up in the court wall near the gate, on the right hand as you enter. Camden saw and published it, but not very correctly, nor with the implication of the letters. Dr. Gale has given a more correct copy of it, Anton. Itin. p. 11, from whence it has been inserted in the last edition of Camden. The only difficulty in the reading, lies in the implication at the end of the second and beginning of the third line: and these, by the course of the inscription should express the tribe, or the name of the father of this Quintianus, and so I have read it; the third line seems to begin with Fil. connected together, the T at the top of the O (or rather Q) is probably intended for the first letter in the second syllable of Quinti. The name <HI>Quintianus</HI> occurs in another inscription in this county (at Piercebridge) and in the Fasti Consulares one <HI>Lucius Ragonius Urinatius Quintianus</HI> was consul in the year 235. This, I fancy by the note in the margin of Camden, has been supposed to be the person, for beneficiarius is omitted in his copy. There is no doubt but CL in the third line stands for Claudia <HI>(tribu)</HI> which we have upon many inscrip∣tions in Gruter. And there was an inscription before, amongst those of Cumberland just in this form. <HI>Marcus Censorius Marci filius voltinia (tribu) Cornelianus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Matribus sacrum Gemellus votum solvit libens merito.</HI>—This was lying loose in the kitchen when I saw it: nor do I remember that it has been made public before. It is an altar to the same Deae Matres, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rected by one Gemellus, or Gaius Emellus, as Mr. Ward conjectures from the name Emellus in Grutter.</P>
<P><HI>Votum solvit libens merito.</HI>—This is built up in the court wall, but the inscription is effaced, and no letters left upon it, but the four at last, V. S. L. M.</P>
<P>He then gives the representation of two altars, one of which was lying loose in the yard, and the other built up in the court wall. That which lay loose has a capital that is somewhat singular, with a praeferi∣culum on one side, and a patera on the other; that in the wall is more simple and plain. I should scarce (he says) have given a draught of either, but that I am persuaded on one of them has been the inscription we meet with in Camden, the original whereof I can no where else discover, and I think it more probable it has been upon the lesser altar, built up in the wall of the court, because the plane of this is taller, and so more likely to contain the number of lines, and the other has probably been dug up later; the altars that were discovered before Camden's time, and had any inscriptions upon them having been designedly built up in the wall of the court. However, as neither of these at present have any vestiges of letters upon them, I must take the copy of the inscription intirely from Camden, who says that it was imperfect even in his time, but according to his reading it is as follows:
<Q>...................... TRIB. COHOR. I CARTOV <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> MARTI VICTORI GENIO LOCI ET BONO EVENTVI.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Tribunus Cobortis primae Cartov <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Marti victori Genio loci et bono Eventui.</HI></P>
<P>That the Romans made an imaginary god of Bonus Eventus is certain, and I have some jealously, that instead of Cartoviorum we should read Carnoviorum, the Cohors Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oviorum is in the Notitia, and was at Pons Aelij."</P>
<P>The military way makes a large <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uin here, and disappears a little near the town of Bishop Auckland, but soon shews itself again very remarkably by its elevation and ruinous pavement, and conducts us directly to Thornborough near Catteractbridge, where the general agreement of antiquaries, the affinity of name, the plain and visible parting of the grand way into two very large and considerable branches, the sure evidences of a Roman station and town, with the accurately due distance on both sides of the same way, do all concur to render us certain.</P></NOTE></P>
<PB N="346" REF="428"/>
<P>A letter from John Cade, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to Dr. Kaye, Dean of Lincoln, given in the Archaeologia, notes Binchester in the following manner— <Q>The Vinovium of “Antoninus, and Binovium of Ptolemy, situated on the stratum called the Fosse∣way, was a celebrated Roman city of the Brigantes, and was sacred, I apprehend, to Bacchus, and derived its name Vinovium from the festivals instituted there in honour of the deity. Altars and antiquities of various kinds have frequently been found there. Camden takes notice of an altar and inscription to the Deae Matres; and of another to the genius of the place; but the most singular is that of a Priapus, at present in the possession of Farrer Wren, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the proprietor of the station. There has likewise been found another portable altar, exactly similar to that in the fifteenth plate of Gordon's Itinerarium Septentrionale, but without any inscription; and also a small bronze image of that diety, which had probably been a symbol worn by the Bacchae, or female priestesses, as there is a perforation in its lower parts; or perhaps it may be classed among the Lares, similar to those discovered at the Devises, in Wiltshire, in the year 1714. This celebrated station contains about twenty-nine acres, and is at present an inexhaustible repository of antiquities. Mr. Wren has in his collection some elegant intaglios found there, with a variety of silver and copper coins, both of the upper and lower empire, to the time of Valentinian and Theodosius. Perhaps the Roman pottery at Vinovium has been equal, if not superior, to most in Britain; I have seen some curious fragments of bowls and vazes, enriched with vine branches, and others intire, which appear to have been used as sacrificing vessels; together with a vast variety of specimens of different compositions, some resemble terra cotta, and ”others of glass.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“There has likewise been lately dug up a large bass relief of a Faun, with an altar, but the inscription hitherto illegible. Dr. Spence, in his splendid edition of the Polymetis, stiles the Fauns and Satyres rural dieties attendants on Bacchus, and Calmet, in his learned Dictionary of the Bible, in a print of Heathen idols, gives a bust of the lascivious Pan for Priapus, which is further elucidated by that singular statue in the Ludovisian gardens at Rome, where he is teaching Apollo to play on the shepherd's reed. The ancients feign Priapus to be the son of Bacchus and Venus, and as such he had divine honours paid him at all the festi∣vals ”of the Bacchanalia, where his image was presented to public view.</Q> Mr. Cade then proceeds to conjectures on the names of places which begin with <HI>Vind,</HI> that they were consecrated to Bacchus.</P>
<P>The station at Binchester lies on elevated ground, near eighty perpendicular feet above the river Wear, which washes its western foot, and by the washing of the bank, which consists of strata of sand and loose soil, the south-west corner of the vallum is gone; the north-west terminates at Mr. Wren's summer-house.— The ground within the station is an inclining plain facing the east, and on account of old inclosures and long cultivation, it is very difficult to ascertain the dimensions
<PB N="347" REF="429"/>and exact figure. In the break of the bank at the south-west corner, the founda∣tions of the vallum are laid open, consisting of very large blocks of stone laid transversly; several pieces of stone aqueducts are on the sides of the hill, where they have shrunk down with the soil. The elevated situation affords an extensive prospect from the station; to the south, Auckland castle, the park, and ornamental buildings, are in front; Coundon Grange crowns one eminence, Westerton another, and the tower of Brusleton a third; whilst the vale of the Wear is opened to the view for a considerable extent to the north and south. Few of the Roman stations every degree, and probably in its environs much sheep, cattle, and horses were bred under the auspices of that diety. To what has been said of the Roman remains discovered here, we beg leave to add, that Mr. Wren has in his possession three seals found at Binchester, cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on coarse cornelians. The first was discovered many years ago, the second in 1767, and the third in 1770. Among the fragments of pottery, there is one impressed with a man on horseback, with a human figure prostrate, as if slain, the horse at full speed; another with the fore parts of a grey∣hound in full speed, boldly relieved: the vessels were certainly dedicated to other deities than Bacchus. The coins consist both of the higher and lower empire, among them one or more of Julius Caesar, but the chief part are of the lower empire. Some of the urns and lacrymatories are elegant pottery: in the hall is a rude head, like that preserved at Thirlwall, in Northumberland, several vazes of a singular form, and one mutilated figure, with an urn in his arms, which perhaps
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
was sepulchral. Of the figure in relief, called a Faun by Mr. Cade, by others conjectured to be a Diana Venatrix, we have for the reader's better judgment presented a cut from a sketch made by Mr. Surtees, of Mainsforth; and beg leave with others to give our opinion relative to it, that it was the ornament of some public edifice, carved as a compliment to a chieftain, under whom the light armed troops had gained singular honours; when we turn our thoughts to the <HI>Fundatores</HI> of the Roman army, we find in all parts of his figure, a similar expression; his bag be∣fore him, containing the balls or stones for his sling, is supported on his left arm; his right arm is elevated in the very action of casting the sling.</P>
<Q><P>"Ipse ter adducta circum caput egit habend."</P>
<BIBL><HI>VIRG. AEN. ix. v. 587.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>He is in the attitude of approach, and every part of the figure supports this idea. The animal is surely a hare, a common emblem of circumspection and watchful∣ness. The figures of slingers on the ancient monuments are very like this.</P>

<P>Some are represented in the action of slinging with the hand lowered to poise the bullet. Those soldiers were furnished with three slings, some hung on the neck, others on the girdle, the bullets or stones were carried in a bag supported on the neck and shoulder. Some of the Fundatores were represented in the old monu∣ments with the hand elevated over the shoulder in the action of slinging.</P>
<P>In Mr. Gyll's MSS. it is noted, that <Q>On Thursday the 5th of August, 1757, “he saw at Binchester, by the side of the way leading up the hill towards Mr. Wren's house, a stone consisting of six sides nearly square, on one side a bold figure of a Priapus in basso-relievo, one of the sides slopes to a narrower square at the top, where a hole is cut, as a mortise to receive the foot or stem of some ”statue.</Q> This curious monument now lies near the farm-house, and has of late years been used for the weight of a cheese-press; but rejected by a late housewife, with much aversion, for its extraordinary sculpture, not discovered by the dame, till her cheese had been spoiled, as she alledged by the unpropitious influence of the enormous diety.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ex author. F. W. <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></NOTE> In the same MS. it is further noted— <Q>That in building a “bridge over the river Gaunless, in the park at Bishop Auckland, in the year 1757, was found a Roman urn of greyish clay, filled with ashes, earth, and the remains of human bones: I saw it in the custody of the Bishop of Durham. The place where this urn was found was about a quarter of a mile from Binchester; where ”several other urns and pieces of pottery have been discovered.</Q></P>
<P>Binchester was one of the vills resigned to the Earls of Northumberland, as be∣fore observed, and it is said was never afterwards restored to the church: this must be noted of the freehold part only, for a large tract of land is still held under the bishop's tenures; and by Bishop Hatfield's Survey it is noted, that Robert of Binchester held Binchester and Hunwick by virtue of the grant of the bishop, by foreign service, formerly held in dringage, as appears by the Bolden Buke; which record, so referred to, states, that Binchester rendered 5 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> cornage, one milch cow, one castleman, four chalders of malt, the like of meal or bread corn, and the like of oats: and that for each carucate of land the villains ploughed and harrowed two acres at Coundon, and every of them made three portions in autumn for each ox∣gang with one man, and carried one tun of wine, and the millstones for Auckland mill: that the drenges fed horse and dog, and attended the bishop's forest hunt with two greyhounds and five cords, followed the court, and served on embassies.</P>
<P>Leland, speaking of Binchester,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Itincrary, vol. 1. p. 79.</NOTE> saith— <Q>Binchester, now a poore villag, stondith “on the south side of Were, and is but half a mile beneth Castelle Auckland.

Behind the house, on the brink of the hill, is a short but delightful terrace, commanding the picturesque prospects of the vale of Wear, with a side view of Bishop Auckland. The other views from the environs of the house are very beautiful: the castle of Auckland crowns the opposite eminence, the sides of which are sloped, and laid out in such order as to smoothen and not distort the countenance of nature; at the foot of the hill the brook of Gaunless winds her silver stream, fringed with wood, and the valley is graced with a well-fancied erection, in form of a cloister, for shelter to the deer, a stone bridge of one arch in the park, and a bridge at the mouth of the brook, where it is discharged into the Wear: the rising grounds opposite to the castle are irregular and bold, on one promontory hangs a forest of venerable oak; on another the deer brooze the brown herbage, and here and there, amongst the scattered trees and glades, the bright accidental lights fall on the softest verdure: thé more distant ground is spotted over with clumps of trees, and the whole girt round with a fine rising plantation: the lofty site of Coundon Grange in one part presents its cone; in another part Westerton, marked beautifully with inclining fences, and the public road drawing to a point. Further westward Brusleton Tower emerges from a forest of brown oaks, and the whole landscape inclines gently to the river Wear, which forms an angle, and sweeps round the foot of Newton Cap.</P>

The whole vill provided a milch cow; the headborough man had an oxgang of land for his ser∣vice.

<P>King James I. by his letters patent under the privy seal, dated at Westminster the 7th day of December, in the second year of his reign, at the petition of Anne Swyfte, of the city of Durham, widow of Robert Swyfte, founded a grammar school in Bishop Auckland, to be called <Q>The Free Grammar School of King “”James,</Q> to have a head master and usher; and twelve governors for managing the revenues of the school; he thereby nominated the Right Noble Ralph Eure, Knight, Lord Eure, Cuthbert Pepper, Knight, Henry Belasys, Knight, Thomas Calverley, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Richard Frevyle, Ralph Butler, Thomas Lever, Stephen Hegge, Anthony Trotter, Thomas Kynge, gentlemen, Henry Bayles, and Roger Bradley, the first governors, and made them and their successors a body corporate and politic, by the name of <Q>The Governors of the goods, possessions, and revenues of the “Free Grammar School of King James, within the village of North Auckland, otherwise Bishop Auckland, in the county of Durham," "and that they should have a common seal, and be capable in law to take lands and other possessions, demise and assign the same, and to sue and be impleaded in all courts of law; with power for them, or the major part, to elect new governors on death or removal,

It stondith on a praty hill bytween 2 ryvers, wherof Were lyith on the north syde, and Gaundelesse on the south, and an arrow shot or more benethe they meete, and make one streame, and ren to the este, and each of these ryvers hath an hill by it. So that the bishop's castelle at Akeland stondith on a little hill betwixt 2 rivers. There was a very auncient manor place logging to the Bishop of Duresme at Akeland. Antonius de Beke began first to encastellate it, he made the great haulle, there be divers pillars of black marble spekeled with white, and the exceeding faire gret chambre, with other there. He made also an exceeding goodly chapelle ther, of ston well squarid, and a college with dene and prebends yn it, and a quadrant on the south-west side of the castelle for ministers of the college. Skirlaw, Bishop of Duresme, made the goodly gate-house at entering into the castelle of Akeland. There is a fair park by the castelle, having ”fallow deer, wild bulles, and kin.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pennant mentions it thus— <Q>Bishop Auckland, a good town, with a large “and square market-place. On one side is a handsome gateway, with a square tower over it. This is a modern edifice, that built by Bishop Skirlaw<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lel. Itin.</NOTE> having long since been destroyed. Through this gateway lies Auckland castle, long the residence of the Bishops of Durham. It has lost its castellated form, and now resembles some of the magnificent foreign abbeys. It is an irregular pile, built at different times; but no part is left that can boast of any great antiquity. Over a bow-window are the arms of Bishop Tunstal, who died in the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. This was originally a manor-house belonging to the see, and was first encastelled<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> by Bishop Beck, who also built a great hall, and adorned it with marble pillars; he founded a fair chapel, a collegiate church, with a dean and prebends, &amp;c. Excepting the church, there are no reliques of the labours of this prelate; the place having been bestowed by the parliament on their furious partizan, Sir Arthur hazelrigg, who, taking a fancy to the place, determined to make it his chief residence. He demolished almost all the build∣ings he found there, and out of their ruins erected a most magnificent house.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hist. Ch. Duth. Dugdale 82.</NOTE> On the restoration, the former bishop, the munificent Cosins, was restored to his diocese. He had a palace ready for his reception, but, by an excess of piety, de∣clined making use of it, from the consideration, that the stone of the ancient chapel had been sacrilegiously applied towards the building of this late habita∣tion of fanaticism. The bishop<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> pulled it down, and, restoring the materials to their ancient use, built the present elegant chapel. The roof is wood, sup∣ported by two rows of pillars, each consisting of four round columns, freestone and marble alternate. The shafts of some of the marble are sixteen feet high; the length of the chapel is eighty-four feet, the breadth forty-eight, the outside ornamented with pinnacles. On the floor a plain stone, with a modest epitaph, informs us, that the pious refounder lies beneath, dying the year 1671. The principal apartments are an old hall, 75 feet by 72, the height 35, and a
<PB N="355" REF="437"/>very handsome dining parlour, ornamented with portraits of Jacob and the twelve patriarchs. Jacob bows under the weight of years. His sons, with each his scriptural attribute; the figures are animated, the colouring good. I think the painter's name is Xubero, one I do not discover in any list of artists. The pictures were bought at an auction, and presented to the place by Bishop Trevor. The same generous prelate built a suit of additional apartments; but, dying before they were completed, they are now furnished in a most magnificent manner by the present bishop.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Egerton.</NOTE> On the old wainscot of a room below stairs, are painted the arms of a strange assemblage of potentates, from Queen Elizabeth, with all the European princes, to the Emperors of Abissinia, Bildelgered, Carthage, and Tartaria, sixteen peers of the same reign, knights of the garter, and above them the arms of every bishoprick in England. The castle is seated in a beautiful park watered by the little river Gaunless, which falls, after a short course, into the Wear. The park is well planted, and has abundance of vast alders, that by age have lost the habit of that tree, and assume the appearance of ancient oaks. Nothing can equal the approach through this ground to the castle, which is varied with verdant slopes, rising grounds, woods, and deep ”precipices, impending over the Wear.</Q> To this<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>The following descriptive lines are extracted from a poem written by one of Bishop Trevor's domestics.</HI>

<PB N="356" REF="438"/>ground on which this town and castle are placed is of an angular form, or rather like the point of a barbed arrow; the streets are extended on the sides of the angle, and terminate in a point at the castle, the interior space being a regular plain, forming a very spacious market-place. The eminence is washed on the north side by the river Wear, and on the south-east by the river Gaunless: the banks are formed into hanging gardens, and the whole aspect is extremely beautiful. The ground on which the town stands is near one hundred and forty perpendicular feet from the level of the plain below: the buildings are erected on the very brink of the hill on each side, which is steep, so that the roads leading from the town north∣ward are both disagreeable and difficult to be descended on horseback. The approach to the castle is by an elegant Gothic gateway, erected by the late Bishop Trevor; the south front opens upon a fine plot, inclosed on each hand by an embattled wall, terminating in square pavilions or turrets:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laid open by the present prelate.</NOTE> the building is already
<PB N="357" REF="439"/>accurately described in that part of Mr. Pennant's work, before repeated: the park affords some beautiful scenes. The ground near the castle is laid out with judg∣ment and taste in slopes and terraces, so applied as to command the greatest variety of prospects. The nearer landscapes are composed of wild and irregular woodlands, bold cliffs, and eminences, mighled in a picturesque manner, holding forth the simple and undistorted beauties of nature: the more distant are composed of rich cultivated grounds, through which the Wear winds its course. As the visitor enters upon the park, the view is most confined; stately trees are scattered over the inclining lawn, at whose foot runs the river Gaunless, the opposite bounds of the stream being formed of high perpendicular cliffs, over whose brink venerable oaks suspend their branches; the hills are broken, and afford many deep grassy dells and shady coppices, the favourite haunts of groupes of deer. Passing the north-east corner of the bowling-green wall, as we enter upon the north terrace, the country opens upon the view, and the landscape is excellent. The chief object in the nearer vale is the deer-house. A road winds through the valley, and, by a stone bridge, passes the Gaunless, whose banks are thronged with a grove of venerable oaks and alders. To the right the grounds form a swift descent; in front, at the distance of a mile, on a fine lofty situation, is Binchester; the ragged and shaken sides of the hill give much picturesque beauty to the landscape, con∣trasting highly with the vale, composed of fine cultivated lands, scattered over with coppices and hamlets, opening upon the view for the length of seven miles, through which you see the meandring streams of Wear in innumerable places, intersected by projecting promontories and little groves. To the left the country rises gradually, and appears in high cultivation: There Newton Cap bridge, of two arches, crosses the Wear, above which stands the mansion-house of the Bacon family. The most distant lands are of a ruder aspect, being lately inclosed, forming an horizon a painter would chuse, to give an advantage to the high colouring in the nearer vale.</P>

<P><HI>Finan,</HI> who succeeded <HI>Aidan,</HI> A.

The monastery increased, and was sup∣ported with dignity under <HI>Colman</HI> and <HI>Tuda;</HI> but upon <HI>Cedda's</HI> consecration, the episcopal residence was removed to <HI>York;</HI> and for fourteen years, <HI>Lindisfarn</HI> was without its bishop; though its monastery still maintained the highest character.</P>
<P>We do not hear of any augmentation of the possessions of the see of <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> till <HI>Cuthbert's</HI> time; and the original erection, or church, stood until <HI>Eadbert, Cuthbert's</HI> successor, rebuilt the church of stone, and covered it with lead, the re∣mains of which work are still standing.</P>

<P>LINDISFARN, Deprived of its dignities; its church and monastery in ruins, in more modern times, affords very few distinct historical subjects.</P>
<P>The ancient description given of this island,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Symcon, p. 87.—Insula Lindisfarnensis continet 8 milliaria. Ex antiq. Codici Dunelmensis.
<P>LEL. COL.</P></NOTE> is to the following purport, <Q>“That, in circumference, it comprehends eight miles, in which was a noble monastery, famous for its prelates (among whom was St. Cuthbert) whose bodies were there deposited, and whose memory will live for ever. It hath the name of Lindisfarn, from a small rivulet, called <HI>Lindis,</HI> which, from the opposite continent, empties itself into the sea." By Bede it is described, <HI>"Qui locus accedente ac recedente reumate bis quotidiae instar insulae maris circumluitur undis, ”bis renudato littore contiguus terrae redditur.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Lindis dicitur slumen, quod in mare excurrit, duorum pedum latitudinem habens, quando Ledon fuerit, id est, minor aestus et videri potest.

Non tanta est Lindisfarne, sed est posita in marc, magnis exturbata fluctibus diebus et noctibus.
<P>LEL. COL. vol. II. p. 173.</P></NOTE> Mr. Grose speaks of Lindisfarn in the following manner: <Q>Bede calls it a semi island, being, as he justly observes, “twice an island, and twice continent in one day: for, at the flowing of the tide, it is encompassed by water; and at the ebb, there is an almost dry passage, both for horses and carriages, to and from the main land; from which, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mea∣sured in a straight line, it is distant about two miles eastward; but on account of some quick sands, passengers are obliged to make so many detours, that the length of the way is nearly doubled; the water over these flats, at spring tides, is only seven feet. This island was, by the Britons, called <HI>Inis Medicante;</HI> also, <HI>Lindisfarn,</HI> from the small rivulet of <HI>Lindi,</HI> which here runs into the sea; and the Celtic word, <HI>falren,</HI> or recess; also, on account of its being the habitation of some of the first monks in this country, it afterwards obtained its present name of <HI>Holy Island.</HI> It measures from east to west about two miles and a quarter; and its breadth, from north to south, is scarcely a mile and a half. At the north-west part, there runs out a spit of land, of about a mile in length. The monastery is situated at the southermost extremity; and a small distance ”north of it, stands the little town, inhabited chiefly by fishermen.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Holy Island</HI> contains about 1000 acres, the half of which, situated to the north, is deemed incapable of improvement, being sand hills, affording little vegetation, but bent; this part, as a rabbit warren, affords a considerable revenue to the pro∣prietor. Those parts as are exposed to the violence of the tempests from the north-east, and subject to be covered with floods of sand, which is frequently
<PB N="361" REF="443"/>swept by the winds to a considerable distance from the shore.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Halsdeni ducis Danorum adventu cognito, Eardulsus Ep.

II. p. 329.</NOTE> The island chiefly consists of one continued plain, inclining to the south-west, which was occupied as a stinted common, but by an inclosure, effected in 1792, it is computed the value is increased eight fold. The ground on which the village stands rises swiftly from the shore: at the southern point, is a rock of a conical figure, and almost perpendicular; in height, near sixty feet, having on its lofty crown a small fortress or castle, which makes at once a grotesque and formidable appearance.</P>
<P>The village consists of a few irregular houses; two or more of which are inns, one appertains to a farm-hold, and the rest are inhabited by fishermen: it has been improved of late years by the building of several new tenements. How different is this description to the ancient state of the town. In an inquisition taken on the death of Eleanor Forster (Nuper de Chatton) 21st King Edward IV. we find tenements described in streets, called <HI>St. Margaret's, St. Helen's, Middilyn-street, Brad-street,</HI> and <HI>Stre</HI> or <HI>Strand-street;</HI> and in a modern advertisement for the sale of a demise from the crown, to Robert Fall, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of a term of years, we observe <Q>the manor of Holy Island specified, with tithes of corn, wool, lamb, “and fish, &amp;c.; a coney warren, sea-ware, fee-farm-rents, heriots, fines, court-leet, sea-wrecks, common of pasture, mines, minerals, and quarries, with seve∣ral ”freehold burgages in <HI>Crossgate</HI> and <HI>Marygate.</HI></Q> Henry Collingwood Selby is now the proprietor. The shore of this island is, in many parts, excellent for bath∣ing, and the situation is at once healthy and romantic: it is, of late years, become a place of great resort; and much praised for the beauties that grace its solemn walks. The north and east coasts of the island are formed of perpendicular rocks; the other sides sink by gradual declinations towards the sands. The fishermen, in the winter season, are employed in catching lobsters, which are sent in great quantities to the London market. Ten or twelve, three or four men-boats are used in the summer, fishing for cod, ling, and haddocks, which abound on the coast.</P>
<P>On the north part of the island, there is abundance of limestone; and a small seam of coal, never much worked, on account of the water, and other difficulties. There is plenty of iron ore in a bed of black shiver or slate; among which are the <HI>Entrochi,</HI> or St. Cuthbert's beads, as the superstitious have called them. The Carron company have men getting iron ore, but they are obliged to work at the ebbing of tide, as the ore lies within high water mark.</P>
<P>The rock on which the castle stands is inaccessible, save only by a winding pass, cut on its southern side; the narrow limits of the crown of the rock will not admit of many works, the whole strength consisting of a single battery on the south east point, mounted with seven or eight guns, which command the approach to the
<PB N="362" REF="444"/>island from the sea, but would be of little consequence against a ship of any con∣siderable force: the rest of the summit is taken up with a house for the governor and garrison, the walls of which stand on the very brink of the precipice. A fortress in this situation, before the use of gunpowder, would be almost impreg∣nable, where the superstructures would be above the reach of any engine, and the rocks too high to be scaled. The antiquity of this castle is not known, but we presume there was some strong-hold here, nearly coeval with the abbey, formed after the Danes had been guilty of their first excesses, and used as a place of refuge for the religious, whenever they were disturbed in their holy retreat; though historians have not related to us, whether any stand was made there against the invading Danes, at their second descent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following extracts are taken from Mr. Grose's work: <Q>Camden mentions it, so that it is evi∣dently “as old as his time. Probably it has been the scene of very few remarkable events; history being nearly as silent, with respect to them, as concerning its origin. The first time it occurs, is in the history of the civil war, in the time of Charles I. when it appears to have been seized for the parliament, and according to Rushworth, in an order of the House of Commons, May 7th, 1646, for sending forces ”thither, this reason is assigned, "its being of such consequence to the northern parts of the kingdom.</Q> Probably this consequence arose, more from the convenience of its harbour, than the strength of the castle.
<P>"In the year 1647, one Captain Batton was governor of the island for the parliament; to whom Sir Marmaduke Langdale, after the taking of Berwick, wrote the following letter, but without success. The letter, together with the captain's refusal, were transmitted to the House of Commons, for which they voted their thanks to Captain Batton, and that he should be continued governor of the place. <Q>“Sir, you have the good opinion of the counties, to be a sober discreet man amongst them, which em∣boldeneth me, a stranger to you, to propose (that which every man, in his duty to God and the king, ought to perform) the veil of these horrid designs, plotted by some, that men may run and read the misery and thraldom, they intend upon the whole nation. It is believed by many that you know, that you are sensible of the imprisonment of his majesty, and the violation of all our laws. If you please to consider the ends being changed, perhaps, for which you first engaged, and comply with the king's interest, by keeping the fort, now in possession for the king's use; I will engage myself to see all the arrears due to yourself and the soldiers, duly paid; and to procure his majesty's favour for the future; and that I only may receive some satisfaction from you, that this motion is as really accepted ”as intended by your humble servant, Marmaduke Langdale, Berwick, April 30th, 1647.</Q></P>
<P>"Holy Island does not appear ever to have fallen into the hands of the royalists; for it continued in the possession of the parliamentarians, anno 1648, when it was, as may be seen in Rushworth, relieved with necessaries by Col. Fenwick's horse and some dragoons. From that time, nothing memorable seems to have been transacted here, till the rebellion in the year 1715, when the seizure of this castle was plan∣ned, and performed by two men only: in which exploit, such policy and courage were exerted, as would have done them much honour, had they been employed in a better cause. The following particulars of the story were communicated by a gentleman, whose father was an eye-witness to the facts, and well knew both the parties.</P>
<P>"One <HI>Lancelot Errington,</HI> a man of an ancient and respectable family, in Northumberland, and of a bold and enterprising spirit, entered into a conspiracy, for seizing this castle for the pretender; in which, it is said, he was promised assistance, not only by Mr. Forster, the rebel general, then in arms, but also by the masters of several French privateers. At this time the garrison consisted of a serjeant, a corporal, and ten or twelve men only. In order to put this scheme in execution, being well known in that country, he went to the castle, and after some discourse with the serjeant, invited him and the rest of the men, who were not immediately on duty, to partake of a treat on board of the ship of which he was master, then lying in the harbour: this being unsuspectedly accepted of, he so well plied his guests with brandy, that they were soon incapable of any opposition. These men being thus secured, he made some pretence of going on shore, and with <HI>Mark Errington,</HI> his nephew, returning again to the castle, they knocked down the centinel, surprised and turned out an old gunner, the corporal, and two other soldiers, being the remainder of the garrison, and shutting the gates, hoisted the pretender's colours as a signal of their success, anxiously expecting the promised succours. No reins orcement coming, but on the contrary, a party of the king's troops arriving from Berwick, they were obliged to retreat over the walls of the castle among the rocks, hoping to conceal themselves under the sea weeds till it was dark, and then by swimming to the main land, to make their escape; but the tide rising, they were obliged to swim, when the soldiers firing at Lancelot, as he climbing up a rock, wounded him in the thigh; thus disabled, he and his nephew were taken, and conveyed to Berwick goal, where they continued till his wound was cured. During this time, he had digged a burrow quite under the foundations of the prison, depositing the earth taken out, in an old oven. Through this burrow, he and his nephew, and divers other prison∣ers escaped; but most of the latter were soon after taken. The two Erringtons, however, had the good fortune to make their way to the Tweedside, where they found the custom-house boat; they rowed them∣selves over, and afterwards turned it adrift. From thence they pursued their journey to Bambrough castle, near which they were concealed nine days in a pea stack; a relation who resided in the castle sup∣plying them with provision. At length travelling in the night by secret paths, they reached Gateshead-house, near Newcastle, where they were secreted, till they procured a passage from Sunderland to France. A reward of 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> was now offered to any one who would apprehend them; notwithstanding which, Lancelot was so daring, as soon after to come into England, and even to visit some of his friends in New∣gate. After the suppression of the rebellion, when every thing was quiet, he and his nephew took the benefit of the general pardon, and returned to Newcastle, where he died about the year 1746, as it said, of grief at the victory of Culloden."</P></NOTE> The present fortifications appear to be the work of the last century.</P>

<P>Great remains of the old abbey are standing; nothing but confused ruins shew where the monastic buildings stood, the walls having been robbed for building parts of the village, and for the erection of the present parochial church. Some authors have alleged, that the monastery was built by <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> of an humble model, without ornament, and inclosed with a high wall, in order that outward objects might not withdraw the attention of the recluse from divine contempla∣tions.</P>
<P>The ancient church was in the form of a cross, the body and chancel of which are yet standing, the other parts greatly ruined, and in some places level with the ground. The order of building in this structure is rude and heavy, and most of it in the worst mode of the early Saxon architecture. Mr. Grose said, <Q>Probably “it was the work of different periods; great part of it seems very ancient, the arches being circular, and the columns very massy, and much like those at Durham, but richer. On the north and south walls, there are pointed arches, ”which prove that part of it, at least, was built since the reign of Henry II.</Q> It is evident that the square tower, or steeple, has been erected long after the first building of the church, as well as several other parts. The pillars, on which the arches rise in the centre of the cross, are clustered and plain capitalled, each form∣ing a corner of the great tower; those arches are of few members. There are side ailes, the columns of which are heavy, and the arches semicircular; where the arches are pointed, the stones are little injured by time; where the arches are semicircular, the stones are much decayed.</P>
<PB N="364" REF="446"/>
<P>The windows are narrow, and ornamented with a corner pilaster, and a mould∣ing of few members: the walls are very thick, and every part wears a gloomy countenance. The south wall of the centre tower is standing, about 50 feet high; and one corner tower at the west end remains perfect. The ruins retain, at this day, one singular beauty; the tower has formed a lanthorn, as in most cathedrals, but from the angles, arches were sprung, crossing each other diagonally, to form a canopy roof. One of the bows of an arch yet remains, unloaded with any su∣perstructure, supported by the south-east and north-west corner pillars, and orna∣mented with the dancette or zigzag moulding, used in the old Saxon architecture, extending a sine semicircle over the chasm, and heap of ruins of the fallen ailes. The whole structure is formed of a red freestone, which yields much to time, and renders the aspect of the building dark and melancholy. Mr. Grose observes the following particulars: <Q>Various fragments of the offices of the monastery are still “standing, and foundations of walls are scattered over a close of near four acres. The main walls of the church, on the north and south sides, are still standing, though much out of the perpendicular; inclining outwards so considerably, as to make the horizontal distance between them at the top, exceed, by near two feet, that at the bottom. Another winter or two seems to be the most that they can stand. This building consists of a body and two side ailes, into which it is divided by a double row of very solid columns, whose shafts are richly ornamented. Each row has five columns, of four different constructions, and two pilasters in the walls on the east and west ends. The shafts of these columns are about twelve feet high, their diameters about five; their capitals and pedestals are plain, they support circular arches, having over each arch two ranges of windows; the lowest large and in pairs, separated only by a short column; the upper small and single. The length of the building is about 138 feet, the breadth of the ”body, 18 feet; and that of the two side ailes, about nine feet each.</Q> The chancel appears to have been rebuilt in much more modern times, and with very little ornament.</P>

<P>The <HI>Farn Islands</HI> possess little matter of consequence, to tempt a traveller to sea, especially where there is so constant a ripling and breaking of the waves, as is to be found between them and the main land.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"A certain priest, named <HI>Utta,</HI> a man of great gravity and sincerity; and one who, for his qualities and truth was well esteemed, was commissioned to go into Kent, for Eanslede, King Edwin's daughter, who after her father's death had been sent thither, in order to her espousal with King Oswin. He was to travel by land to Kent, but was to return by sea; on which account he addressed Bishop Aidan, be∣seeching him to put up fervent prayers to God, to prosper their voyage. The bishop gave them his blessing, and having recommended them devoutly to the protection of God; he also delivered to <HI>Utta,</HI> some jars of hallowed oil, saying, I foresee, that whilst you are at sea, a sudden tempest will come upon you; remember to cast into the troubled waters the oil that I give you, and speedily the tempest shall be assuaged, and the sea be ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med, and you shall have a prosperous voyage. All these things were fulfilled according to the prophecy. At the beginning of the tempest, when the waves chiefly raged, the sailors endeavoured in vain to cast anchor, but the storm increased and the waves multiplied so fast, that the vessel was almost filled with water, and nothing but immediate death presented itself. In this distress, the priest had recourse to the bishop's directions, and took the pot of oil, some of which he cast into the sea, and the sea was immediately calmed, and the ship proceeded with a prosperous voyage. Thus the man of God, through the spirit of prophecy, predicted the tempest, and by the Holy Spirit, though he was himself absent, appeased the same."</NOTE> In the month of August,
<PB N="366" REF="448"/>when we visited the islands, the sea was tumultuous, making a violent inset be∣tween them and the opposite shore. They are 17 in number, the largest and only one we thought worth attending to, is the House Island, nearest to Bambrough, where St. Cuthbert made his residence. Mr. Pennant visited them all, and his judicious remarks we have collected in the notes.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The nearest isle to the shore lies exactly one mile, 68 chains, from the coast; the most distant, is about seven or eight miles. They are rented for 16 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann. their produce is kelp, some few feathers, and seals, which the tenant watches and shoots, for the sake of the oil and skins. Some of them yield a little grass, and serve to feed a cow or two, which the people are desperate enough to transport over in their little boats. We visited these islands in a coble, a safe, but seemingly hazardous species of boat, long, narrow, and flat-bottomed, which is capable of going through a high sea, dancing like a cork on the sum∣mits of the waves. Touched at the rock called <HI>Meg,</HI> whitened with the dung of corvorants, which almost covered it; their nests were large, made of tang, and excessively faetid. Rowed near the <HI>Pinnacles,</HI> an island in the farthest group; so called from the vast columnar rocks at the south end, even at their sides, and flat at their tops, and entirely covered with guillemots and shags; the fowlers pass from one to the other of these columns, by means of a narrow board, which they place from top to top, forming a narrow bridge over such a horrid gap, that the very sight of it strikes one with terror. Landed at a small island, where we found the female eider-ducks at that time sitting; the lower part of their nests was made of sea-plants; the upper part was formed of the down which they pull off their own breasts, in which the eggs were surrounded and warmly bedded; in some were three, in others five eggs, of a large size, and pale olive colour, as smooth and glossy as if varnished over. The nests are built over the beach, among the loose pebbles, not far from the water. The ducks sit very close, nor will they rise, till you almost tread on them. The drakes separate themselves from the females during the breeding season. We robbed a few of their nests of the down, after carefully separating it from the tang, found that the down of one nest weighed only three quarters of an ounce; but was so elastic, as to fill the crown of the largest hat. The people of this country call these, St. Cuthbert's ducks, from the saint of the islands. Besides these kinds, I observed the following: Puffins, called here tom-noddies.—Auks, here skouts.—Guillemots.— Black guillemots.—Little auks.—Shiel auks.—Shags.—Corvorants.—Black and white gulls.—Brown and white gulls.—Herring gulls, which I was told, sometimes fed on eggs of other birds.—Common gulls, here annets.—Kittiwakes or tarrock.—Pewit gulls.—Great terns.—Sea-pies.—Sea-larks, here brockets.—Jack-daws, which breed in rabbit-holes.—Rich pigeons.—Rock-larks. The terns were so numerous, that in some places it was difficult to tread without crushing some of the eggs. At the north end of the House-island, is a deep chasm, from the top to the bottom of the rock, communicating to the sea, through which, in tempestuous weather, the water is forced with vast violence and noise, and forms a fine <HI>jet d'eau,</HI> of sixty feet high; it is called by the inhabitants of the opposite coast, the <HI>churn.</HI>

<P>The horrible description given of this island by ancient authors, before <HI>St. Cuthbert</HI> blessed it with his presence, is already mentioned, vol. I. p. 22. After the death of <HI>St. Cuthbert, Ethelwold,</HI> who took on him the religious habit at Ripon, resorted to the hermitage of Farn, and possessed it twelve years, ending his life there. <HI>Felgild</HI> succeeded <HI>Ethelwold;</HI> and in the time of that hermit, <HI>Eadfrid,</HI> Bishop of Lindisfarn, restored, from its foundations, the oratory of <HI>St. Cuthbert,</HI> which had gone to ruin. <HI>Bede</HI> relates, that <HI>Felgild</HI> was more than 70 years old when he wrote the life of <HI>St. Cuthbert.</HI> Besides the persons mentioned by <HI>Bede,</HI> there were other devotees who chose Farn for the place of their retreat. <HI>St. Bar∣tholomew</HI> was one, as appears from a manuscript history of his life in the Bodleian Library, who obtained leave of Lawrence, Prior of Durham, to go to <HI>Farn,</HI> where he found one <HI>Elwyn</HI> in possession of the desirable residence, and whose religion was not sufficiently tempered with charity, to induce him to welcome the stranger. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> wrote in this retreat his Farn meditations, now preserved in the Dur∣ham Library. Here prior <HI>Thomas de Melsonby</HI> spent the last years of his life in devotion and austerities.</P>

<P>A priory was founded here for six Benedictine monks, subordinate to Durham,<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Bede's account of St. Cuthbert growing corn in Farn. <Q>He desired to have wheat brought him, “and tools to till the ground, and when he had prepared the land with infinite labour, and sown the seed in due season, in the summer there appeared neither blade nor ear; when he was again visited by his brethren, he required of them barley for seed, and having sown it in the same field, out of all ”sowing season, and without hope of fruit, there grew up an abundant crop.</Q>

The whole church is covered with tiles, and by late repairs, ceiling, and new stalling, it is now a decent place of worship. The most ancient possessors of lands at Ancroft we find noted, are the Colvils. Robert de Colvil, Knight, was seized of various parcels of land, together with a rent issuing out of the mill of <HI>d' Ancroft,</HI> and out of <HI>Bracina</HI> a malting there, held in capite of the lord bishop by the service of half a knight's fee.

In the inquisition taken in the 21st year of the same prelate, when the settlement was inquired of, on the petition of Ralph Gray, and the descent was stated, it is set forth that this manor, with the other estates, had been in the hands of the bishop in right of his church, by reason of a forfeiture on Thomas's being convicted of high treason, at Southamp∣ton, by the name of Thomas Gray of <HI>Heton,</HI> in the county of Northumberland, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> on the 5th day of August, in the third year of the reign of Henry, late King of England, father of the then present king, and in the eighth year of the prelate's consecration, before John Earl Marshal, and others, commissioners, <Q><HI>virtute “cujus judicij idem Tho. pater p'dci Radi convictus fuit de prodicoe p'dca et positus ad ”mortem.</HI></Q> About the year 1464, Ralph Gray died seized of this manor.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Holy Island.</NOTE></P>

The soil is a strong and fertile clay, mixed with loam, except a tract up Tweedside; and a plot, stretching from the Till to Cornhill, which is rich, friable, dry loam; an excellent turnip soil. Lime and coal abound, but the latter is of an inferior quality. Stone marle is found on the banks of the Tweed, but not used on account of the great expence which attends it.</P>

<P>The present village lies in a low situation, on the banks of the river Tweed; except the lofty castle that crowns the adjoining eminence, there are few remains to prove the antiquity of the place; Hoveden called it Ubbanford; and we have such proofs on record, of its significance in the annals of the border history, that its distant antiquity is undeniable.</P>
<P>The building of the church at Norham occurs in the beginning of the ninth century: Egrid, to whom that godly work is attributed, was consecrated Bishop of Lindisfarn, A. D. 831;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Said to be built in 840.—The parish register begins 1653.—several of the family of Selbies are buried in the church—Ralph, 1660—Grace, 1648—William, 1654.</NOTE> and he is said to have given Norham to the see for ever; but this assertion we are induced to discredit, on the grounds before∣mentioned; that Oswald, who invited the pious missionaries into his territories, gave them Norham for their first residence. The middle aile only of the ancient church is now standing, and by some modern repairs, is rendered a decent place of worship. The chancel, or east end of the church, appears to have been totally destroyed; the present vicar, the Rev. Robert Lambe, in levelling the ruins of walls in the church-yard, discovered a sculpture, which, we apprehend, was the ornament of an ancient font. There are represented on this stone three person∣ages; in the upper compartment St. Peter with his keys; in the lower compart∣ment St. Cuthbert, and St. Ceolwolf with his sceptre: on the fillet which divides these figures is an inscription, beginning I. H. Z. but the other characters are so broken, that no antiquarian has hitherto attempted a reading of the inscription; which induces us to omit a plate of the sculpture.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">An etching was given in the History of Northumberland, but it did not procure any explanation.</NOTE></P>
<P>There were three chauntries in this church, one of which was dedicated to St. Cuthbert, the founder's name not now known. One Thomas de Kellawe occurs chaplain in the year 1362. The second chauntry was founded by Bishop An∣thony Beck, in the year 1288, and was dedicated to the blessed Virgin.

<P>Camden and his editor say, that <Q>when the Danes ravaged Holy Island, where “St. Cuthbert, so much celebrated by Bede, sat as bishop, and was buried, certain persons, by a religious thievery, endeavoured to remove his remains; the winds setting against them, obliged them to leave the holy body with due reverence at Ubbanford; and we are not certain, whether the see was not removed thither, near the river Twede, where it lay many years, till the accession of King Ethel∣red.”</Q>

<P>We have no authority for determining, that there was not a regular fortress at Norham, during the time that the see was resting at Lindisfarn, or Chester; but it is natural to conceive from the situation, that some fortification, helm, or strong∣hold occupied the hill where the present castle stands.</P>
<P>From the time the see was seated at Durham, in the year 995, until the time of Bishop Ralph de Flambard, we do not hear any thing particular of Norham, ex∣cept, touching the grant of Bishop Walcher, of Norham and Lindisfarn to the church of Durham, particularly mentioned in the annals of that prelate.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Will.

Bishop William Carilepho, who succeeded Walcher, in consequence of his palatine jurisdiction, displayed a military standard, similar to that of a sovereign prince, which was called <HI>the banner of St. Cuthbert,</HI> and was carried with the troops with which Edgar marched into Scotland. This expedition might furnish an idea, that a fortress at Norham would prove a barrier of the utmost consequence to the possessions of the church, and to the protection of Northumberland. The bishop's death followed soon after Edgar's expedition; and the see remained vacant be∣tween three and four years, before Ralph de Flambard was consecrated Bishop of Durham, 1099. The convulsions of the state, and the adversity which Bishop Ralph experienced, prevented him executing a plan he had conceived on his ob∣taining the see; for he was of a bold and enterprising spirit, and had a genius for military affairs: Edgar had granted Berwick previous to this aera, but its chief consequence was in maritime affairs, of which we hear little, when compared to the warfares on land; so that a fortress, such as Norham, would appear of the greatest consequence to the frontier. It was not till the year 1121, that the pre∣late effected this great work; it is situated on the brink of a steep rock, whose foot is washed by the river Tweed.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ranulphus quoque Dunelmensis episcopus, Castellum incipit apud Norham super Ripam Twed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.
<P>LEL. COL. vol. II. p. 203.</P></NOTE> Camden describes Norham castle, in his time,
<PB N="394" REF="468"/><Q>“to be situated on the top of a high steep rock, and fortified with a trench: the outward wall of great circuit, was guarded by several turrets, in a canton to∣wards the river, in which another wall, much stronger, incircled the keep or ”tower, of great height.</Q> This description furnishes a perfect idea of the figure of this fortress, after it had received repairs by Bishop Tunstal. Towards the river, the ruins now hang upon the very verge of the precipice; part of which, by the washing of the stream, has given way, and carried with it the superstructures on that side; which, with the decay incident to the length of time, has occasioned a wide breach in the outward wall, spoken of by Camden: the turrets, as he was pleased to call them, appear to be no other than demi-bastions, a mode of fortifi∣cation generally followed, in which the chief strength of this castle was constructed; a perfect model of which we have described to the reader, under the title of Hartlepool, a place presumed to be of nearly the same date.</P>
<P>The wall of Norham castle, which stretched from the water on the south side, was guarded with a gateway and tower above it, having square turrets on each hand: the ascent from thence was steep, the way bending towards the east; and through the wall, the entrance was by another gateway of superior dimensions, fortified by two heavy round flanking towers, the remains of which are still con∣siderable. This appears to have been the chief entrance, and fronts to a plain of considerable extent; it was defended by a draw-bridge over a very wide moat, which began near to this gateway, and was extended round the castle on the land∣side, inclosing a spacious area or ballium, fortified with a very strong wall, garnished with demi-bastions at intervals. To defend the keep or main tower, a strong wall incloses a narrow area or interior ballium, which is entered by a gateway, guarded on each hand by square towers. The keep is a very heavy square build∣ing, vaulted underneath, like most structures of this sort. Part of the vaults or prisons remain entire, but all the interior parts of the tower above, are laid open and ruined. The remains of an exploratory turret appear on one corner of the keep; it may be presumed it was uniform, with similar turrets on the other cor∣ners. The height of the great tower is about seventy feet, containing four stories, or ranges of apartments. The whole building is constructed of red freestone, of a soft nature, and subject to decay: there is not the least ornament about it; the whole aspect is miserably gloomy: it wears the countenance of the time of King Stephen, without any of the embellishments of the age in which Bishop Tunstal lived.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob. 1528.</NOTE></P>
<P>The outworks, of late years, have been much demolished, particularly near to the western gate; the ashler stones of the facing of the wall are all removed; and only the rubble and cement, or run-lime, with which the inner part of the wall was filled, remain; which has a very rugged and ruinous appearance. These de∣predations were made by Mr. Thomas Alder, for the building of a farm-house a little way to the south of the castle. Mr. Alder purchased the castle of Mr. Fenwick of Lemington, and has lately sold it to Sir Francis Blake, Bart. whose veneration for the works of antiquity, will protect these remains from the hand of wanton destruction.</P>

<P>This was a formidable fortress, inaccessible from the Tweed; and, before the use of fire arms, appears to have been impregnable, when fully garrisoned, and duly provided with stores for a siege: when the oillets and other parts, formed for the garrison's fighting and defence, were properly armed with engines, and manned with experienced archers; and when the bastions were kept by men of courage, it seems almost incredible, that the place could be taken by assault.</P>
<P>After Bishop Flambard's death, the castle did not remain long unassailed by the Scots, in 1138, whilst Galfrid Rufus was bishop, King David I. of Scotland, besieged Norham; the castle is described to consist, at that time, of a very strong tower, surrounded with a wall. The Scotch forces having refused to proceed on their incursion, on account of the solemnities of Lent, retreated from the eastern parts of the county of Durham, where they had committed dreadful depredations, and undertook the siege of this castle in their return homeward; it was at that time thinly garrisoned, with nine knights only and their attendants: a gallant defence was made for some days, but no succours arriving, the place was surren∣dered, and the defenders were permitted to retire. David proposed to the Bishop to resign the castle, on condition that he should renounce his allegiance to Stephen, in favour of the Empress Maud; on the bishop refusing to accept such terms, the king caused the castle and town of Norham to be destroyed.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lyt.

<P>The castle and fortifications were restored by Hugh Pudsey, Bishop of Durham, in the year 1154: he then built the great tower, which remains to this day. The prelate purchased his peace with the king, for certain defections in favour of the Scotch, whom he suffered to pass unresisted through the lands of his palatinate, by surrendering to him this fortress. Roger de Coniers, who was constable of the castle, resigned it to Will. de Nevill, the king's nominee,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rym. Tom. II. p. 564.—Hugo Pusar Epus Dun.

<P>This prelate granted a charter of privileges to his burgesses of Norham, of equal tenure with other burgages north of Tyne, and similar to those of Newcastle; and he also granted to them certain lands, to be holden as freely as they had done in Bishop Flambard's time, reserving to the men, or dependants of the Schoris∣worth monks, their common of pasture.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Carta Hugonis Epi concessa Burgensibus de Norham.—E.

<P>In the time of Bishop de Poicteu, A. D. 1203, King John held a personal con∣ference with William the Lion, King of Scotland, at this castle, touching the de∣mand made by the Scotch king of the northern counties; but nothing was deter∣mined, and King John returned in great displeasure. The see was vacant from the death of Bishop Philip, in 1208, to the time of Richard de Marisco's confir∣mation, in 1217: during this vacancy, in the year 1209, King John came with a great army to Norham, whilst the King of Scotland was assembling his troops at Roxburgh, and a dreadful war seemed to be threatened from the English sove∣reign's extravagant demands, and vehement wrath against the Scottish nation; but by the intervention of the nobles of both nations, the two monarchs agreed to adjourn their conference to Newcastle, whither the King of Scotland immediately repaired, attended by his brother David, and a large train of his nobility; but be∣ing suddenly taken ill, a truce was agreed upon, till the king's health was restored. The dispute remaining unsettled, the armies of both nations continued assembled, until the nobles again prevailed to renew the conference at Norham, in the same year, when a treaty of peace was concluded, in which King John stipulated not to erect any fortress at Tweedmouth, which the states of Scotland had strenuously opposed; and King William, on the other hand, deposited a large sum of money, to indemnify the sufferers for the ravages he had committed on the English borders.</P>
<P>In the year 1211, the two sovereigns held another conference at the castle of Norham; at which Ermengard, Queen of Scotland, was present, and by her amiable and conciliating conduct, greatly promoted the treaty, on which they had met. Here the terms of the former peace were ratified, and several new articles were agreed to.</P>
<P>In the year 1213, King John, in the utmost apprehensions of an insurrection of his subjects, and an invasion from France, in consequence of the papal interdict that had been pronounced, came again to Norham, anxious to secure the amity of Scotland. William, the Scotch king, was then much indisposed, and was not able to proceed further than Haddington to meet the King of England. Highly
<PB N="397" REF="471"/>chagrined at this disappointment, John returned southward, and it was not long before the sentence of deposition was pronounced against him, his kingdom given to the king of France, and a croisade published against his territories, by the emissaries of the see of Rome. Driven to sad dilemmas, John was at length obliged to make his peace with the holy see; the interdict, which had continued six years, was revoked, and the lands of those who had adhered to the papal au∣thority against their sovereign, &amp;c. had been pronounced forfeitures to the crown; of which, those of Eustace de Vesey were part, were restored. Soon after this event, succeeded that glorious combination of the barons, under which <HI>the great charter and charter of the forest,</HI> were obtained from the reluctant hands of this miserable tyrant. <HI>To those patriots, whose names ought to be engraven on the heart of every Briton, we owe every thing valuable upon earth, the liberty we possess, and our authentic right to the property we enjoy.</HI> The memory of <HI>Eustace de Vesey, Richard de Percy, Robert de Ros, Peter de Bruis, Nicholas d' Estoteville, William de Moubray,</HI> and <HI>Oliver de Vaux,</HI> northern barons, in this combination, should be immortal.</P>
<P>William, King of Scotland, dying, was succeeded by his son Alexander II. a youth not more than fifteen years of age. The barons of Northumberland had recourse to him for protection, and thereupon did homage at Felton. This in∣censed King John so much, that he prepared for a northern expedition: in 1215, King Alexander came before Norham with a might army; and after an investi∣ture for forty days, he was obliged to raise the siege. Leland, from the Scala Chronica, has this passage,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lel. Col. vol. II. p. 535. Dug. vol. I. p. 566.

<P>During the vacancy of the see, between the death of Bishop Richard de Marisco, and the confirmation of Bishop Richard Poor, 12th King Henry III. A.

In the pleas of <HI>quo warranto,</HI> taken in the 21st year of King Edward I. the bishop claimed and had confirmed to the see among other privileges, that the Bishop of Durham had his chancery, and by his writs, and proper justices, holds all pleas within the liberties of Durham, Sadberge, and Bedlington on south of Coquet, and Norham beyond Coquet; that he had three coroners in the three wards of Durham; and also, one at Sadberge, one at Bedling∣ton, and one at Norham; that he has his place of execution at Norham, and ex∣ercises there the jurisdiction of infangenetheof and outfangenetheof; has his fairs and markets at Norham, and holds all pleas of the crown at Norham, from fifteen days to fifteen days, or from three weeks to three weeks, at his pleasure; and also holds in exigent and outlawry, with power of pardoning outlaws. That the bishop hath privilege by his bailiff, to apprehend any man of his palatinate in Northum∣berland, at the suit of any subject of his bishoprick, in order to have him at a place called Holdenburn, on the march between Norham and the body of the county, where he shall suffer the law.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The whole record set out, p. 234.—Annals Bishop BECK, vol.

<P>A convention was appointed to be holden at Norham, on the 10th day of May, 1290, previous to King Edward I. entering upon a hearing of the claims made by the competitors for the crown of Scotland, on the death of Margaret of Norway, the infant heiress. The assembly was held in the church at Norham, where, were present, the king, and many of the prelates, nobles, and chief personages of both nations. The king previously demanded a recognition of his supremacy, and it is said, that his claim was historically deduced with great artifice and judgment by Bishop Beck; after which, three weeks were given for the states of Scotland to deliberate on the subject. On the 2d day of June then next, eight competitors, with several of the prelates, nobles, and community of Scotland appeared, and held their council on this important matter. <Q>Congregatis ex opposito castri de “”Norham, ex alia parte fluminis Tweedae in quadam arda viridi.</Q> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rot.

After judgment was given at Berwick, in favour of John Baliol, on the 20th of Nov. 1292, he swore fealty to the King of England in the castle of Norham, in the presence of many of the nobility of both nations; and a commis∣sion was issued from thence, for enthroning him at Scone.</P>
<P>No remarkable event took place here in the time of Bishop Richard Kellaw, save only that the prelate delivered up Norham castle to King Edward II. for

<P>Lewis Beaumont was scarce seated in the see of Durham, before the Scotch besieged Norham, A. D. 1318: Sir Thomas Gray was then governor, by whose brave defence, and the timely aid of the Lords Percy and Nevill, it was preserved from the hands of the enemy. In order to carry on the siege, the Scots raised two forts against the castle, one at Norham church, and the other at Upsetlington. On another siege, in the year 1322, the Scotch became masters of this fortress, but held it a very short time, for King Edward retook it after an assault of ten days, with a powerful army.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John D'Arci, 10th Ed.

<P>In Leland's Collectania, we have the following curious particulars of this siege, from the Scala Chronica:</P>
<P>"The Scottes came yn to the marches of England, and destroyed the Castelles of Werk and Herbotel, and overran much of Northumberland marches.</P>
<P>"At this tyme Thomas Gray and his frendes defendid Norham from the Scottes.</P>
<P>"It were a wonderfull processe to declare what mischeses cam by hungre and asseges, by the space of xi yeres in Northumbreland. For the Scottes became so proude, after they had got Berwick, that the nothing estemid the Englischmen.</P>
<P>"About this tyme, there was a greate fest made yn Lincolnshir, to which cam many gentilmen and ladies, and emonge them one lady brought a heualme for a man of were; with a very riche creste of golde, to William Marmion, knight, with a lettre of commaundement of her lady, that he should go into the daungerust place in England, and there to let the heualme to be seene, and knowen as famose. So he went to Norham, whither withyn 4 dayes of cumming cam Philip Moubray, gardian of Berwike, having in his bande 140 men of armes, the very flour of men of the Scottisch marches.</P>
<P>"Thomas Gray, capitayne of Norham, feying this, brought his garison afore the barriers of the castel, behynd whom cam William richely arrayed, as all glit∣tering in golde, and wearing the heualme, his lady's present.</P>
<P>"Then sayd Thomas Gray to Marmion, "Syr Knight, ye be cum hither to fame your heualme, mount up on yor horse, and ryde lyke a valiant man to you
<PB N="400" REF="474"/>armie even here at hand, and I forsake God if I rescue not thy body deade or a lyve, or I myself wyl dye for it.</P>
<P>"Wherapon he toke his cursore and rode among the threng of ennemyes, the which layed sore stripes on hym, and pullid hym at the last oute of his sadel to the grounde.</P>
<P>"Then Thomas Gray, with all the hole garnison, lette prick yn emong the Scottes, and so wounded them and their horses, that they were over throwen, and Marmion sore beten was horsid agayn, and with Gray pursewid the Scottes in chace. There were taken 50 horses of price, and the women of Norham brought them to the foote men to follow the chace.</P>
<P>"Thomas Gray hymself killed one Cryne, a Fleming, an admiral, and great robber on the see, and yn hye favor with Robert Bruise. The resydew that escapid were chacid to the nunnes of Berwik.</P>
<P>"Adam de Gordon, a baron of Scotland, cam with 160 men, to dryve away the catel pasturing by Norham, but the yong men of the countery ther aboute, en∣countered with them, whom Thomas Gray seing to stande in jeopardy went oute with onely 60 men, and killed most parte of the Scottes and their horsis.</P>
<P>"This same Thomas was tuise assigid yn the castel of Norham by the Scottes, one tyme by the space almost of an yere, the other vij monithes.</P>
<P>"His ennemies made forteresses before the castel, one at Upsedelington, a nother yn the chirch of Norham. The castel was tuise vitailed by the lord Percy and Neville, that became very noble men, and riche and great socorers of the marches of England.</P>
<P>"The utter ward of Norham castel was ons taken yn Thomas Gray's tyme, on the vigil of St. Catarine, but they kept it but 3 dayes; for theyr purpose yn myn∣ing fayllid them."</P>
<P>In 1326, on the night of King Edward III.'s coronation, the Scotch forces assaulted this castle; Robert Maners, then governor, had received previous inti∣mation of the intended attempt, and suffered sixteen of the assailants to scale the outward wall, who were immediately put to the sword. In 1327, soon after their flight from Weardale, the Scots laid siege to Norham, and took it by storm.—Le∣land, from the Scala Chronica, sets forth, that <Q>Shortly after the Scottes by covine “fledde clere away from Stanhop Park in the night; wherefore the young King Edward wept tendrely, and returnid to York. Robert Bruse, King of Scottes, had asseigid the castel of Norham, when Robert Maners was capitayne; which, with his garnison, issuid oute one day, and discomfitid the Scottes, killing William Mouhand, a baron of Scotland. The Counte of Morref and James Douglas beseigid the Lord Percy, in the castel of Alnwick; but they sone depertid to ”Robert Bruse their king lying at the seage of Norham.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Constab.

Some authors assert the Scotch did not raise the siege, till the Earl of Surry, with an army of 20,000 men came to the support of the garrison, and obliged the assailants to retire.

In the year 1551, a treaty was signed in the church of Norham; the Scotch commissioners were Robert Bishop of Orkney, Robert Lord Maxwell, Thomas Master of Erskine, and Louis de St. Gelais, Lord of Linsac, Knight: those for England were Thomas Bishop of Norwich, Robert Bowes, Leonard Beckwith, and Thomas Chaloner, Knight. In 1552, the castle of Norham, which, from the time of Bishop Flambard, had apper∣tained to the see of Durham, appears from Lord Wharton's proposals for the better protection of the marches to be vested in the crown.

<P>We have mentioned in the annals of the prelates, volume the first, the alienation of the manor of Norham and Norhamshire, with the sisheries in the Tweed, and their several franchises, by Bishop Barnes to Queen Elizabeth. Her majesty granted the castle, the demesnes, and the tithes, to Sir Robert Gray, Earl Monmouth, for his own life, and the lives of his two sons. His lordship sold them for 6000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the furniture of the castle for 800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to George Hume, Earl of Dunbar. The manor belongs to the Haggerston family; and the castle and demesne, containing one thousand and thirty acres, as surveyed about 1751, extending eastward on the banks of the Tweed near two miles, came to Robert Fenwick, of Lemington, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in right of his wife, one of the daughters and coheiresses of William Orde, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Sandy Bank.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dugd. vol.

<P>CORNHILL, on the south-west extremity of the shire, is noted for its valuable medicinal waters. In the escheats of the 1st of King Edward I. this place is mentioned to be the possession of William de Cornhill.</P>
<P>There was a castle at Cornhill, which was besieged and taken by the Scotch in 1549: it is described as being an old house at that time of considerable strength. On this occasion the assailants gained a valuable booty.—The fort tower near the bridge, opposite to Linnel House, we presume is part of the remains, surrounded with a ditch, called <HI>Castle-stone-nich;</HI> well situated for the defence of the bridge.</P>

South-east of Cornhill are the remains of an extensive encampment; but to what people, or what particular event this apper∣tained, even tradition is silent. The lines are irregular, but of great extent; and, what is most remarkable, the vallum is defended by a range of conic eminences, which have been mistaken for tumuli.</P>
<P>The records are very barren of information touching this manor.

In the 36th year of Bishop Hatfield, by an inquisition then taken, it appears that Robert Gray, of Cornale, before his death, enfeoffed of Richard de Carlton and others of the third part of the manor of Cornale, and all his lands in Cornale and Goswick, to hold of the chief lord of the fee, and the feofees enfeoffed Agnes his wife, with remainder to Robert's right heirs. His daughter and heiress Maria was then under two years of age. By an inquisition taken in the 24th year of the same prelate, it appears that Maria, before mentioned to be the heiress of the last named Robert Gray, was then dead; that the lands in the inquisition named, with half a water corn-mill, and a fishery in Tweed, together with one hundred acres of demesne land in Goswyk, and thirteen acres of husbandry land there, after the death of Robert Gray, had come to the bishop's hands; that Maria, who was his daughter and heir, and was the wife of William Swinhowe, died before she attained her age of twenty-one years; and that Agnes, the widow of Robert Gray, also being dead, their lands and tenements were still in the hands of the bishop, by reason of the

<P>The ditch on the south and west sides of the dungeon tower, or keep, has of late years been dug into, and there has been obtained from thence a large quantity of excellent manure, consisting of black and rotten straw, and other vegetable matters, which had supplied the cattle in former times; this is mixed with decayed lime from the ruined walls. In clearing out the manure, a large two-hand broad sword was found, an iron spur, with a brass-rowel, an inch and a half in diameter, a steel arrow point, several plaited straps of leather, each half an inch in breadth, which appeared to be the remains of a buckler to resist the force of weapons, and the remains of a shoe, very sharp at the toe, and narrow at the instep. A very deep well was discovered, in an apartment adjoining to the dungeon tower.—J.

Elizabeth his daughter was found his heir. The Herons of Ford also had considerable possessions here. On the death of William Heron de Forde, Arm. in an inquisition taken at Durham in the 22d year of the same prelate, it is stated, that he died seized of a capital messuage, then wasted, with divers parcels of land in the territory of Cornhill, which he held of the bishop by military service <HI>ut de castro et dominio suo de Norham.</HI> And that he was seized of other lands there, which he held by homage, fealty, and suit of court at Norham.—John his son and heir was in his minority, and his lands were taken into the hands of the bishop. In the succeeding records we find nothing more of the Herons.</P>
<P>Cornhill is a small vallage, through which the turnpike road passes leading to Edinburgh. The ancient seat of the family of Collingwoods is here, an old house, built in the form of a cross.

<P>Tillmouth is an ancient manor, where, amongst other ancient proprietors of lands, we find the Kingestons, who were Lords of Twisel.

<P>On a peninsula formed by the confluence of the rivers Till and Tweed, was an ancient chapel, on the side of which, about five years ago, Sir Francis Blake built a small chapel; the windows of which some wanton and sacrilegious villians have lately destroyed. About thirty yards to the west of this place, and fifteen from the Tweed, lie the the remains of a stone boat or coffin, in which, tradition says, the body of St. Cuthbert was miraculously conveyed down the Tweed from Mailross. By some hydrostatical experiments whilst it was intire, we are informed it was proved that it might float with the remains of the saint. Mr. Gough, in his Additions to Camden, says, that it <Q>is a stone boat, of as fine a shape as a boat of “”wood.</Q> We confess we did not examine the parts so narrowly, being prejudi∣ced with the idea, that they were the mere fragments of a stone coffin.

The castle was of square form, and very strong, situated on the steep banks of the river Till; on the west side had an area, or court, called the <HI>Lion's Court;</HI> it sustained a siege by the Scotch before the battle of Flodden-field; and is now entirely demolished, except one apartment, thirty yards in length, which is vaulted; the lower part is used for stables and stands for cattle; and above the vault there is a granary.

<P>TWYSELL.</P>
<P>On the east side of the river Till, on the brink of a rocky precipice, stands Twysell, the seat of Sir Francis Blake, built in a castellated form, of a fine white freestone, said to be remarkably pleasant and commodious; the circular turrets at the corners affording a great command of prospect. Sir Francis is improving this mansion; the rooms are all vaulted to prevent accidents by fire; the gallery, when finished, will be a noble apartment, being in length ninety feet, and twenty-two
<PB N="415" REF="489"/>feet in width. The first proprietor we meet with in the Durham records, is William Riddell, who, in the time of Bishop Beaumont, was seized of the manor of Twysell, and the hamlets of Dudhowe and Old Grindon, parcels of that manor, which he held by the payment of twenty marks rent, and suit at the court of Norham. He was also seized of the manor of Tillmouth, with its appurtenances, (except one carucate of land belonging to a chauntry) and two husbandries of land which Hugh Riddell held, and one third part of the manor which was in dowry to Emma, the wife of William Riddell, son of William: the whole held by the service of one half of a knight's fee, suit at the county, and payment of 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> yearly for the keeping of Norham castle: but at that time those manors were destroyed by the Scotch, insomuch that they were returned of no value.

It is highly probable, that it rose out of the ashes of an old Roman station, whose name we have lost; there be∣ing still in the parish, and not half a mile distant, a hamlet, at this day called Romanby, through which runs an old Roman way, from Thirsk to Cattarick, where it joins the great Ermin street; and the great banks and intrenchments,

<P>Sir Thomas Savile, in a letter to Camden (Illustrium virorum Epistolae, &amp;c. 1691.) conjectures that Northallerton was anciently the <HI>Camalodunum</HI> noted by Antoninus, Ptolemy, Pliny, and Tacitus; and adds, that the Bishop of Durham had a charter, in which <Q>Patria de Camuloduno continens iii leucas “in latitudine atque 25 in longitudine, ab Edwino Northanhumbrorum rege episcopis Dunelmensibus ”conceditur;</Q> and that the see of Durham, under this charter, held the territory of Northallerton.</P></NOTE></P>

<P><Q>“In the year 769, Beornredus, or Earnredus, a tyrant in Northumberland, burnt down Catterick, the Roman Cataractonium, but five miles distant from Northallerton, which latter, therefore, might very well be destroyed by him at the same time; and continued to lie waste, till after the death of the two Danish kings, Inguar and Hubba, A. D. 883, when King Alfred caused the desolate part of Northumberland, as all the country between the Humber and the Tweed was then called, to be reinhabited. No sooner had this wise and good king any respite from his wars, than he began to repair the losses sustained from the enemy, by raising up demolished towns and castles out of their ruins, and erecting new ones, where necessary, for the defence of his territories, or convenient for the habitation of his subjects. Among others, Alvertune, now called Offerton in Derbyshire, is believed to have been one; but since no anci∣ent author gives us their names, is is merely conjecture: and then, why will not the same conjecture hold as good for Northallerton, that still retains more of his name? and though he first bestowed the kingdom of Northumberland upon Guthrun, the Dane, at his baptism, as well as that of the East Angles; and after∣wards upon one Guthred, a young man redeemed from captivity, to be placed upon a throne, they were only feudatories to him, and when the latter died, he ”reunited both those kingdoms to his own dominions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“This town, before the conquest, was held by Siward, Earl of Northumber∣land, with the schire belonging to it, and was in all probability destroyed again, when the conqueror, enraged by the rebellion against him in these parts, laid waste all the country, between York and Durham, in the 3d year of his reign: ”for we find at the end of the account in Doomsday Book, modo "vast. est."</Q></P>

<P>This diminution probably happened when William Rufus seized the liberty, and on the restitution by Henry I. the severed parts were not restored; a cir∣cumstance Mr. Gale had not noticed.</P>
<P><Q>“The town was a third time destroyed by the Scots (led by Sir James Douglas and Thomas Randolf) in the 12th King Edward II. when they made an inroad to the very gates of York, as appears by a mandate of that king, directed the year following to the collectors of the taxes, to exempt it, and several others, from the payment thereof, in consideration that they had been ruined by those ”his enemies and rebels.</Q></P>

<P>Leland noticed the brook which runs cross the street, called Sunbeck, and adds, <Q>“a litle by north without Alverton toun, is a bridge of one arch of stone, through the which commith a bigger broke than Sunbeck, toward the west, and passith through the meadows, betwixt the castelle hilles and the bishope's palace, and thereabout receiveth Sunnebeck, and within half a mile lower goeth into Wisk. ”The name of this bigger broke is Willow Beck.</Q>—By this and other notes of Leland's, it appears, that in his time the bishop's palace and castle were two distinct places, divided by Willow Beck.</P>
<P><Q>“The castle was built near the town, on the west side, by the Bishop Galfridus Rufus, in the time of Henry I. but much nearer to it than the old Roman castrum. This bishop gave it to a nephew of his, that had married a niece of the Earl of Albemarle's, as God win says; but the continuator of Symeon Dunel∣mensis tells exactly the same story of William Cumin, chancellor of Scotland, who had made himself master of the bishopric, upon the death of the bishop, A.

<P>From the various authorities, it seems not to be disputed, that the bishops of Durham had a palace or manor-house at Northallerton, though it is uncertain who built it; Leland's description ascertains the situation of it; in Lambarde's time it was become ruinous; and is described to be a "wheather beaten castle," In Northern Memoirs, by Richard Frank, published in 1604, who saw it in 1568, "demolished with age and the ruins of time; then a receptacle for bats and buz∣zards, "owls and jack-daws.</P>
<P><Q>“About the middle of the town, in the east row, stands a brick building, called the <HI>Maison Dieu,</HI> an hospital founded by Richard de Moore, a draper in North∣allerton, about the year 1476, for thirteen poor men and women, though now it only maintains four. There were many lands and houses formerly belonging to it, now lost; at present it only enjoys two fields, called Maison Dieu, and Castlehill closes, the rents of which are divided amongst the poor of the hospi∣tal, and may amount to about 40 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> a-year to each. Some have said it was founded by one Sir James Strangeways, but this Sir James and his son were only trustees to see the hospital kept in good repair, and their pensions duly paid to the poor. The persons herein to be entertained, were obliged by the founder, every morning and evening, at six o'clock precisely, to repeat fifteen pater∣nosters, and as many-ave maries, and the three creeds in honour of our Lord's passion; as also, to pray for the soul of Richard de Moore the founder, Michael de Longbain, and others, the benefactors. They had at first 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> p. annum, to buy sea coals, and were to find two beds for distressed and destitute travellers one night; and in the 20th Henry VIII. this allowance was increased to 1 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> The Earl of Carlisle, at present, nominates the persons to be received into this hospital, being a descendant from Leonard, son to the Earl of Dacres of Gilsland, who married the heiress of the family of Strangeways.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A late publication notes, that the inhabitants of the town of Northallerton now nominate the poor persons.

<P>Since Mr. Gale wrote his account of this place, the church has received several alterations. In 1779, the chancel being in a dangerous state, was pulled down, and when rebuilt, was roofed with slate; and in 1786, the roof on the western part was taken down, and a new one of slate placed there; these alterations have injured the appearance of this building very greatly. The fourth bell in the tower is inscribed, <HI>"In multis annis, resonet campana Johannis;"</HI> it is of a sweet tone, and is said to have belonged to the priory of Mount-grace.</P>
<P>Several of the family of Bowes were interred here in the beginning of the last century. John Constable of Lasenby, 1619, and Richard Danby of Romanby, about 1651, were buried in the chancel. In 1585, in one of the windows, in painted glass, were two armorial shields, bearing on the dexter side, <HI>sable;</HI> three greyhounds current, <HI>argent;</HI> the arms of Mauleverer. These were impaled in one of the shields, which had a label of three points, <HI>or,</HI> with the arms of Courtney, being <HI>or</HI> three torteaxes above a fesse <HI>gules;</HI> and in the other with a coat <HI>argent,</HI> upon a chevron three martlets, colours and owner unknown.

As the fortnight-day is now used only from Christmas to St. George's day, it is probable the town enjoys that in consequence of King John's grant, when he gave to them the two first fairs, and that by the new grants of Philip and Mary, and that of James I. they attempted to continue ”them throughout the year, without success.</Q></P>

<PB N="440" REF="515"/>
<P>In addition to what we find in Mr. Gale's MSS. we must observe, that the town of Northallerton, since the date of Mr. Gale's letter, is much improved in build∣ings, there being a great number of very handsome houses erected of late years, and it is become the residence of several people of considerable fortune. The lands are in good cultivation, and lying warm, though of a clayish constitution in general, are yet very forward, and produce abundant crops. Within two or three years last past, a house of correction, or penitential house, on a new plan, with a very commodious court-house, have been built near the south end of the town, on the east side of the street. This town is thirty-two miles north of York, and thirty-four miles south of Durham.</P>
<P>On viewing the Castle Banks with much attention, together with a wish to re∣concile, if possible, a sketch made by the learned Dr. Stukelv, which is copied into Gale's MSS. where the remains are called the Old Roman Camp of Romanby, we found ourselves greatly dissatisfied: all the vallums are now perfectly grassed over, and in the whole ground there is not the least appearance of mason-work; so com∣pletely have the materials been removed,-for the purpose of building the houses in the town, many shewing evidently whence the stones were obtained; bricks being chiefly used in the modern edifices, the register office is built of stone. At Romanby there is not any trace that we could discover of a Roman camp, and submit it to the reader's judgment, whether the name of the village is not a corruption of Roman-way, from its supposed situation, or is derived from the name of some ancient owner of the estate: if the Romans had a fort in its vicinity, we should be inclined to conceive with Dr. Stukely, it was situated where the Castle∣banks, (as the present remains are now called) do lie; though by such large and extensive modern works, the traces of a Roman fort are defaced. The chief or strong hold of the castle consisted of a circular mount, defended by circumvallations and ditches; this mount, it is to be presumed, supported a tower, and the balliums formed by the circumvallations, according to the fashion of the times in which this fortress was erected, most probably were strengthened by turrets and bastions.— The mount is very steep on the west side, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the east the access is more gra∣dual: it is about twenty feet in perpendicular height, is in circumference three hundred paces, and the sides are so steep as to be ascended with difficulty: the crown is a level plain. Immediately at the foot of the mount is a ditch which runs quite round it. On the west side a vallum rises immediately on the outside of the ditch, but as it advances to the eastward, spreads itself to a considerable distance; and shews great remains. To the north side a large mole or bulwark rises on the vallum, and seems to have been cast up by assailants, to maintain an attack on the mount. There are considerable traces of a wide ditch on the outside of this vallum. On the west there are no other out-works, but the ground appears as if it might in former times be flooded, and thence the castle rendered unassail∣able on that part. From the mole and vallum last mentioned, there runs out to a considerable distance another vallum, shewing great remains, and taking a large
<PB N="441" REF="516"/>sweep, terminating at the brook which runs on the south, and inclosing three or four acres of land; the outward vallum has a deep ditch, which, by receiving the waters of the brook, must have afforded a very powerful defence. On this last vallum, to the north, and not far distant from that before noted, is another bul∣wark or mole: we at first considered those eminences as the ruins of some gate∣way towers, but on examining the approach, that idea was relinquished.</P>
<P>CRAKE.</P>
<P>To the east of Easing wold about three miles, and twelve from York, lies Crake; the castle, church, and village, stand on the summit of a lofty eminence, rising from an extensive plain, steep and inaccessible on every side but on the south, where the approach is gradual. This little shire is almost circular, the chief part lies to the north of the village. The castle stands on the very summit of the hill, the church to the south-east, and from thence the village, with an open and spacious area, lies on the slope. Leland in his Itinerary gives this account, vol. I. p. 74: <Q>“Then I saw on the right hond, a 4 miles of, the castelle of Crek, gyven by King E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bright to St. Cuthbert. There remainith at this tyme smaul shew of any old castel that hath beene there. There is a haul, with other offices, and a great stable volrid with stone, of a meatly anncyent building. The great squar tower, that is thereby, as in the toppe of the hill, and supplement of loggings, is very fair, and was erected totally by Neville, Bisshop of Duresme (reg. Hen. VI.) There is a park, the circuit of the lordship is 7 miles, and the value being a 40<SUP>l</SUP>i. ” by the yeare.</Q> On the point of the hill are the remains of several vaults, which now lie open; the principal one to the south has a passage to a vault on the east, greatly ruined, and one to the north, now perfect: it seems that this structure had originally consisted of four vaults, all dark, but communicating with one another: the centre was a kind of column, in which is a staircase leading from the super∣structure to the vaults; passing up these flairs, we ascended into a small apartment or turret, with a stone roof, of groined arching, having a circular opening in the centre: the rest of the superstructure is all gone, so that it is impossible to form any judgment what its original figure, or of what extent it was. About fourscore yards from these remains, to the westward, and in some degree lower, is the square tower mentioned by Leland, placed on the edge of a precipice; but the hall, which we presumed by the ruins had stood adjacent to the tower, is gone down; the tower, which forms an oblong square, fronting to the south, and built of durable freestone, is now used as a farm-house; the walls are of a remarkable thickness, and the lower apartments seem to have been constructed for prisons, and not as household offices, though above ground. The prospect from this eminence is most astonishingly beautiful; we do not know of any thing like it in the northern parts of this kingdom: to the eastward it is for a short distance' confined by rising grounds, but on every other quarter a level plain is extended to the eye above twenty miles; in which lies the city of York, to the south; with a multitude of towns and villages leathered round the Queen of the Vale, too numerous to be named here, as that would not be so satisfactory as casting an eye on the map; the boundaries of the prospect to the north and north-west are the en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ences which
<PB N="442" REF="517"/>rise behind Catterick, and adjoin to the openings of Wensleydale and Swaledale, and extend towards Richmond, thence forming a chain which stretches to the east, and terminates the vast landscape: the whole plain consisting of a country highly cultivated.</P>

There is a low square tower. In the corner, on the north side of the entrance into the chancel, is an altar tomb, with two recumbent essigies in alabaster, much mutilated, but still discovering elegant workmanship. The male figure is without a helmet or cap of mail, the hair laid back in the front, and curled at the sides, a beard, and the head rested on a cushion; a complete suit of armour to the feet, the hands elevated, but now much broken, the sword on the left side, and a shield on the left arm, bearing three bars, with a lion rampant over all. The female figure has a peaked coif spreading at the temples, and a large ruff, a dress perhaps more ancient than the time of Queen Elizabeth. There is no inscription to denote the personages here interred. In a nich in the wall is a rude essigy of a female kneeling, much defaced and whitened over; the strait bodice and sleeves, and high rolls on the shoulders, shew this figure was of higher antiquity than the tomb before described: a brass tablet has been fixed in the adjoining wall, the nich remaining, but robbed of its ornament.</P>

That there should be in this church of Hoveden, five prebends for ever, and each of them to maintain, at his own proper costs, a priest and clerk in holy orders, to administer in the same, in a canonical habit, according to the custom of the church at York, and to observe the like way of singing, as those of York church (excepting in matins, which they shall say in the morning for the parish) and one of them who is most fit shall be rector of the quire, and ordain things belonging to divine service: and each of them, as an ebdomodary, shall orderly keep his turn, and serve the cure of the parish by his respective priest, in the ”portion assigned to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Morever he appointed, that the priests at the altars of St. Mary, St. Thomas, and St. Katharine, be in conformable habit, present at all canonical hours, processions and high masses; and other altars should in no wise be deputed to the priests of prebends, least by that means the number of ministers be diminish∣ed, who are rather to be augmented. Likewise he ordained, that each of those three altar priests, should have for their service, in augmentation to their sti∣pends, one marc yearly, out of the obventions of the great altar. Likewise he ordained and granted to the prior and convent of Durham, to be appropriated to their own use, viz. the chapel of Estrington, with the profits ecclesiastical of the same town, and of the towns of Cayvill, Portington, Ousthorpe, Hythe, Birland, Sandholme, and Newland. The land of the marshal, and the land of the chamber of Limpinhill, Grenhant (or Grenaske) Delasise, and Holy Land, with the tithe of John de Warwicks; together with the sepulture of the parishioners of the said towns, and the emoluments and burdens parochial, so as the prebends be for ever free from payment of pensions and procurations. And all the residue of the parishes of Hovedune should be assigned to the five prebendaries, distinguished as hereafter: and also the obventions of the altar
<PB N="451" REF="527"/>and mortuaries, and personal tithes of those towns, deputed to the said prebends, should be converted to the uses of the canons, and be amongst them equally divided; which said canons should for three months in the year, at least, make their personal residence in the church, either so long together, or at several ”times.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Also the prior and convent should have the patronage of the said prebends, and should present the prebendaries to the archbishop, to be by him instituted ”and inducted; or to the dean and chapter of York, in vacancy of the see.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The area, or church-yard, should be proportionably divided to the pre∣bendaries for their habitations; and the value of the buildings then erected, should be converted to the fabric of the quire: and least any dispute should arise about order of sitting or presidng, the following manner of sitting in the quire, was by the archbishop ordained.—On the south side: I. The prebendary of Hoveden, called the first prebendary, shall have the first place.—II. The prebendary of the third prebend (Thorpe) the second place.—III. The preben∣dary of the fifth prebend (Saltmarsh) the third place.—IV. The priest of the altar of St. Thomas, the fourth place.—On the north side: I. The prebendary of the second prebend (Barneby) the first place.—II. The prebendary of the fourth prebend (Laxton) the second place.—III. The priest of the altar of St. Mary, the third place.—IV.

<P N="5">5th, St. Andrew's: this ancient chauntry was founded by Thomas, son of Jordan de Metham, who granted to the said altar, in the church of St. Peter at Hoveden, 5<SUP>m</SUP> annual rent, issuing out of three oxgangs of land, one lying in Askelby, another in Hoveden, and the third in Laxton: which he purchased of Sir Thomas de Hooke, Knt. for the maintenance of one chaplain, who should daily celebrate divine service at that altar of St. Andrew's, for the souls of the said Thomas and Alice his wife, his parents, and all his ancestors.</P>
<PB N="458" REF="534"/>
<P>The church is dedicated to St. Peter. In Ecton it does not appear to be certi∣fied. The prebends were dissolved by Edward VI. in 1547, and the patronage of the vicarage thereby became vested in the crown.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the endowment of the cathedral church of Durham by Henry VIII. vol. II. p. 112, wherein ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the manors of Howden, Hemyngburg, and Northallerton, are granted to the dean and chapter, in as full a form as they possessed the same before the dissolution. An exemption follows:—<HI>Exceptis et omnino reservat. nobis haredibus et successoribus nostris omnibus illis libertatibus juris∣dictionibus franches<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is et privilegiis, quae modo aliquo statuto five or dinatione sunt ad nihilata revocata vel evacuata.</HI>
<P>The statute of King Edward VI. reversed this part of the grant, and the two collegiate churches were reduced.</P></NOTE> The temporalties were granted out by letters patent, dated 19th January, 1582, and have passed through various possessors to the present owners, noted under each prebend. Whilst the property remained in the crown, it produced a revenue of 40 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum: upon granting out, a rent of 6 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 14 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> was referved, and for the demunition 32 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> ten years purchase was stipulated to be paid, but came under the exemptions of the statute of 43 <ABBR>d</ABBR> Queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>The church is in the form of a cross, the tower rising in the centre; the quire is in ruins, but the remains shew that therein the most ornamental work of the edifice was disposed. Mr. Grose, in his excellent work, gives the following account of this edifice, ornamented with a view of the west aspect:— <Q>This church stands in “the east riding of Yorkshire, and in a district called Howdenshire, exempt from the authority of the archdeacon, and subject to the dean and chapter of Durham. When it was built does not appear. Tanner says that Hugh, Prior of Durham, obtained a bull from Gregory IX. for the appropriating this church for the maintenance of sixteen monks.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide p. 77, vol II. He procured the appointment to be improved by the institution of prebends.</NOTE> But, upon further consideration, Robert, the Bishop of Durham, in 1266, caused it to be divided into five prebends for secural clerks, viz. Hoveden, valued 26th Henry VIII. at 18 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> in the whole, and 12 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> clearly; Skelton, valued at 15 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> in the whole, and 9 <ABBR>l</ABBR> clearly; Thorp valued at 16 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 11 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> in the whole, and 9 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 18 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> clearly; Saltmarsh, valued at 16 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> in the whole, and 10 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> clearly; and Barnaby, valued at 16 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> in the whole, and 9 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> clearly.

There were also six vicars, besides chauntry priests, in this ”collegiate church, which was dedicated to <HI>St. Peter and St. Paul.</HI></Q> Mr. Grose then quotes certain passages from Gent's book,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Author of the History of Ripon, &amp;c.</NOTE> where, after lamenting the fall of the eastern part, or quire, he says, <Q>and as on the south-east side the chapter “house, which resembles that of York, but less, having seven of the most curious arched windows, once, no doubt, adorned with painted glass, (as might vie with any in England) seems to be the next victim to time, the following small sketch is presented, that an idea of it may be rendered to the reader, when the greater part of the beautiful original shall happen to be no more. The east part, or ancient quire, has been very magnificent, as appears by its venerable ruins, all the top fallen in, with much of the walls, &amp;c. What remains of the lofty roof∣less
<PB N="459" REF="535"/>walls, shew the admiring but dejected spectator the most curious work∣manship; as on the south part the effigies of King David playing on his harp; St. Peter and St. Paul, (the figures of those two saints being also at the west end) underneath the former is Delilah cutting off Sampson's hair; David killing the lion, &amp;c. The east window, except that it had a little one over it, resembled that of York minster; but the remains declare, in my humble opinion, infi∣nitely more beauty as to its image work; for yet are to be seen the effigies of St. Cuthbert, <HI>to whom and St. Peter</HI> this church was dedicated, Bishop Skirlaw, and other bishops, St. Catharine, with her wheel, Justice, &amp;c. Near the south door are the remains of a chauntry, where the Saltmarshes and Methams families do still bury their dead. There, mixed among the stupendous ruins, are to be perceived the effigies of two knights templars, no doubt of the said families; with the representation of a most beautiful lady. The choir fell down not many years ago. But in the wicked usurper's time, the inner part was miserably rent to pieces; its melodious organ pulled down; some of the vile miscreants his soldiers carrying the pipes, and scornfully striving to tune them, as they pro∣ceeded towards Wresell," &amp;c. "The west part is appointed for divine service, ”near which is a convenient school.</Q> Mr. Grose then proceeds with notes made by Mr. Pennant; which state, that the length of this fabric is <Q>two hundred and “fifty-one feet, transept an hundred. East part quite a ruin; its window superb and elegant, arches pointed, columns adorned with flutings, tracery of side win∣dows ”various.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The entrance to the east part, three doors, well ornamented, two niches on ”each side the chief.</Q></P>
<P>To this description we must add, that, from the remains, it is evident, the quire has had side ailes similar to the nave; the side doors out of the transept, and side windows to the east, corresponding with the idea, though not the least remains of a column is standing; for after the roof fell in, the shaken pillars, we apprehend, were taken down to their foundations. The centre door now enters into a commodious vestry room, which incroaches upon the ground of the old quire. The length of the quire is thirty-eight paces, and the width twenty paces; there are six windows on each side, divided by beautiful pilasters, the capitals or∣namented with pierced work; the springings of the groined archings of the roof yet remain. The windows have consisted of three lights, with various tracery: the centre window to the east is eight paces in width, and, like the rest of the windows, is under a pointed arch.—The quire has lately been dressed up, and the remains of the vaulting, capitals, and carving, are piled against the walls on each side; but no monuments appear in the floor, except one flat blue stone, ornamen∣ted with a crosier, chalice, and book, and inscribed in the black letter,—"Hie jacet Joh. Cobe cap. canti sci Tho. M'iris q. obi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sest. Mich. ao. do. MCCCCL. cuj. aia. ppicietr De.</P>
<P>Mr. Burton, who probably saw the quire before the roof sell in, or he took his account from Johnson's MSS.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Date 1670.</NOTE> to which he frequently applies, says,— <Q>In the
<PB N="460" REF="536"/>“quire is a white stone, about the verge whereof is engraven in the black letter, Orate pro aia **** quondam Thomae Maners armigeris qui obiit vj die mensis ”Octobris ano dni 1464 cujus aia pptur Deus. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q>—Also in the quire, a white stone, whereon is fixed a brass plate, thus inscribed:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>late is now preserved in the vestry room.—W. H.</NOTE></P>
<P><Q>“Here lyeth the body of Peter Dolman, of Kilpin, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> counsellor at law, who married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Remington, Clerk, Archdeacon of the east riding, in the county of York, deceased, by whom he left issue three sons, Zacharah, Philip, and Timothy Dolman, who departed out of this transi∣tory ”world the thirteenth day of December 1621.</Q></P>
<P>From Johnson's MSS Mr. Burton gives the following epitaphs, &amp;c.— <Q>In the “quire are two gravestones of blue marble, the portraitures in brass, but the timber (1670) was so fallen as to cover them. The inscriptions remaining." Hic jacet Magister Tho. Babthorpe sacr. theologiae bachalarius istisque ec∣clesiae canonicus residensiarius. Et Hen. Babthorpe frater ejusd. mag. Thomae quiquidem magr. Thomas obiit 14 October, 1478, et predict. "Henricus ob. 18 Jan. 1478."—"On the other stone,—"Hic jacet Tho. Morton quondam canonicus et residensiarius Ecclesiae Cath. beati Ptetri Ebor. ac istius eccles collegiatae et unus magistrum cancellar. D'ni regis qui obiit 22 Maij, 1447. ”cujus, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>The windows were perfect, we may presume, in Johnson's time, for in his MS. referred to by Burton are drawings of shields of arms, in the first window of the east end of the south aile, blazoned:—1. Quarterly three bars sable on a field Or, three squirrels vert on a field argent; the last as the first, &amp;c. 2. Quarterly three bars sable on a field Or, with a conton a rose gules on a field argent. A lion rampant. Argent, on a field sable. The last as the first, &amp;c. 3. Quarterly a lion rampant, sable on a field argent, an owl, Or on a field gules; the first as the last, &amp;c. And in a window, on the south side of the quire, the arms of England and a shield of arms, three <HI>Torteaux</HI> in chief, on a field <HI>Or,</HI> a fesse <HI>Gules.</HI> In a high south window, several other shields of arms, not material to be described in this place: we will only add that, in a high north window are two shields of arms: 1. A cross fleury Or, on a field gules. 2. A lion rampant sable on a field Or.</P>
<P>In the south aile of the quire this inscription:</P>
<P><Q>“Orate pro anima Amae quondam uxoris Thomae Manners Armigeri quae obiit ”6 Oct. 1460, cujus, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>There are two chapels or porches to the quire, of nearly the same situation and projection, adjoining to the transept. Johnson's MS. notes, that <Q>the porch on “the south side was divided into two parts, that towards the south belonging to ”the Saltmarshes, and the other to the Methams.</Q> It is astonishing that various visitants should differ in their accounts of simple facts. Mr. Burton says, <Q>There “is an elevated monument in the middle of the aforesaid quire (porch) adjoining ”to the pillar,</Q> whereon lie two effigies of stone, a man and a woman, between which figures is a rude rib of stone work, as if a partition had gone up between them; "andt he partition," says Mr. Burton, <Q>of the Methams and Saltmarshes
<PB N="461" REF="537"/>“has gone up between them; therefore it is a question, whether they were man ”and wife or not; tradition says she was a Saltmarsh<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>A Pedigree of the ancient Family of SALTMARSH, of Saltmarsh, and of Newby Wisk, Com. Eb.</HI> 1785.

<PB N="462" REF="538"/>“and in armour, having the arms of Metham, and at the head of the monument a bird. The woman is also cross-legged. Around on the sides of the monument are represented twelve several children, some having books in ”their hands, others scrowls, and others birds.</Q> Mr. Grose, from Mr. Pennant's notes— <Q>On the floor is a fine tomb of a knight cross-legged, a shield, a mantle, “his neck and head bare, short hair. Mourners and religious in niches round the ”tomb; and one person with a falcon. A lady in a loose gown cross-legged.</Q> Mr. Gough, in the superb work, entitled "Funeral Monuments," p. 95, says, that "in a chapel adjoining to the quire" of this church <Q>is a lady of the family “of Metham cross-legged." Again, "In a chapel on the south side of the ruined quire, a cross-legged knight, like Ross in the Temple church, in flowing hair, his head on a double cushion, his hands in mail banded at the wrist, and a sleeve, a large sword at his left side, mail on his legs and feet, and single spurs; a lion at his feet, on his long pointed shield, quarterly mullet, in the first quarter a fleur de lis, Or, Metham. By his side lies a woman, in a flowing coif, her ”right leg seemed crossed, but the figure is much damaged;</Q> and he then pro∣ceeds to describe the figures on the sides of the altar part. We beg leave to add, that there is a rich canopy at the head of the knight, the sword lies at his left side sheathed, and the left leg is crossed uppermost; the cap of mail is down in the neck like a hood, and the hands are elevated. The female figure is much mutilated, and to us did not seem to have originally belonged to this tomb. Johnson's MS. notes, <Q>Adjoining to the south wall lies the representation of a “man in armour cross-legged, with a dog lying at his feet, and on his shield the arms of Saltmarsh." Mr. Pennant says, "Another cross-legged knight, his
<PB N="463" REF="539"/>head, cheeks, and neck guarded with chain armour, sticking quite close, a fillet round his head, his breast set with roses." Mr. Gough's description: "Under a south window is a knight on a single cushion, in a round <HI>helmet</HI> of mail, with a plain fillet, a gorget of the same, also greaves and shoe bands, spurs on both ”feet, a lion at the feet, a long sword, and on his shield the arms of Saltmarsh.</Q> We must add, that the hood of mail is put close up, and bound with a fillet; he is covered with mail to the extremities, the right leg lies uppermost, the sword is sheathed, and hangs in the belt; the hands are elevated. Mr. Johnson's drawing of the arms on the shield gives it the bordeur, but there is not that addition: he gives nine croslets, and there are but seven on this shield, placed 3, 1, 2, and 1. Johnson's MS. proceeds, <Q>On another gravestone is the figure of a man in “armour, with four escocheons, all having the last-mentioned arms, and this ”inscription round the stone—"Orate pro aia Johannis Saltmarsh Armageri qui ob. 16°. Aug. 1512, cujus, &amp;c.</Q> This monument is not noted by any other visitant; we found a flat blue stone, with the inscription, but no figure or shields of arms, or any appearance of groves where brasses were.

And if she be cleared of it in law, then the orders of the queen's high commissioners to be performed at large, and all these things to be concluded by the whole consent of the parish, and to be done by expedition.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 1570.—Hoc mense, tanta fuit, per totam parochiam Hovedensem aquaram inundatio, adeo ut nemini liceret ad oppidum Hovedenum venire, nisi qui scapnis, naviculis, lintribus, aut hujus modi vas∣culis vetrebantur.—<HI>From Register of the Parish.</HI></P>
<P>EAST RIDINGE OF THE COUNTIE OF YORK.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 10th, 1655.—Itt is to bee remembred that Geo. Belt, of Belby, gent. did take the oath of re∣gister for the p'rish of Hollden, according to an act of parliament, in that case made, for recording of births, burials, and marriages, by us justices of the peace for this East Riding.</P>
<P><HI>Phil. Saltmarshe, Cha. Fenwick.</HI></P>
<P>This George Belt seems to have been a very curious person, from the remarks he has made in the register during those times.—The following are the incidents which he has taken notice of:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Sept.</HI> 1654.—This year, several of the Londoners deserted the fair, and sold their goods at Beverley.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Jan.</HI> 1654-5.—Wheat sold for 20 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> p. bushel, and rye for 12 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> do. in Howden market.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Mar.</HI> 10th, 1654-5, Saturday.—Twenty-nine eggs sold for threepence.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sept.</HI> 1655.—The Londoners kept the fair wholly at Howden, according to its ancient custom and freedom.—This year brought forth great plenty of orchard fruit; so that on the 29th of September, ap∣ples were sold for one penny p. peck at Selby fair.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>June</HI> 1656—There was no sacrament administered at Howden the last year; the reason whereof is best known to Mr. John Thompson, minister.—The marriages of Howden are solemnized upon the days of public meeting, the justices of the peace (first Tuesday in each month, as occasion required) hearing and determining matters and controversies amongst neighbours depending, with sundry other public affairs. <HI>P. Saltmarshe, of Saltmarsh. C. Fenwick, of Babthorpe.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sat. Jan.</HI> 13th, 1654-5.—Whitgift ferry-boat sunk, when John Pycock and Marmaduke Maskell, of Adlingfleet, with five more, were drowned, and three escaped.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sat. April</HI> 21st, 1655.—The ship Constant, Richard Chapman, of Howden, master, laden with 300 <ABBR>qrs.</ABBR> of corn, and other necessaries, sailed from Howden-dyke; and at Skelton the said vessel came foul of some stake or pile, whereby she received a breach and sunk, to the great loss of said corn and other provisions.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sat. May</HI> 5th, 1655.—A fire broke out at Foggathorp, in the house of Francis Blanshaw, husband∣man (himself, wife, and two sons, at Howden market, and one at home) a neighbour's servant came to fetch fire, the wind southward; it seemed some spark scattered in the dunghill, kindled in the straw, ascended the barn and dwelling-house, being remote from help, it consumed there his substance.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Aug.</HI> 1655.—F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll a great rain, where, in some places, the waters exceeded their bounds, swept away much hay, some corn, and other hay corrupted by the unseasonable season, the like scarce memorable: it enlarged the price of corn.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Oct.</HI> 1st, 1655, <HI>Monday.</HI>—The workmen began to sink the well upon the corn-market-hill; Mr. Henry Gunsell, constable.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Dec.</HI> 1655.—The river Ouse was, in some places, so frozen, that at Langrick, and also between Air's∣mouth and Booth, people went over the ice, yet not much snow.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Wed. Jan.</HI> 2d, 1655-6.—Joshua Lumley, of Howden, shoe-maker, and deputy bailiff, was for doing murder (near North Cave, the day before, on the body of William Pearson, shoe-maker, of Kirkella) apprehended at Howden, and from thence sent to the goal at York, there received and lodged; within four or five days after, upon what bail (if bailable) I know not, but home he came, which thing seemed strange to men of good understanding, and within four days did fly for it from Howden.</ITEM>

<P>Some estates in Eastrington and Cliff, Cum Lund, (Hemingbro' parish) are held by chevenage, the owners paying 2 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> at Michaelmas court, whether present or absent.</P>
<P>In Howden is an old house, called Holy Kurn, and close by a garth, called Almry Garth.</P></NOTE> in the drawings falsely repre∣sented;
<PB N="464" REF="540"/>to the arms of Metham there being added a chief; and the sinister arms represented a bend between two split eagles. Mr. Gough's account is accurate, In <Q>“the south wall is a flowered arch, with a bouquet, sided by Metham, and a spread-eagle, ”debruised by a bend.</Q> The effigy spoken of by Johnson is gone; we were informed the boys of the school had broken it away, for the sake of the alabaster; but rather presume, that, to save it from being totally spoiled, the work∣men clearing out the quire had removed it, and placed it on the tomb in the tran∣sept, where is a figure set up against the pillar, represented in a canonical habit, apparently not belonging to the tomb where it is placed. The MS. gives another epitaph from this porch, which we found cut in the black letter, on a large blue stone, <Q>Hic jacet Thomas Metham, Miles, fil. Alexandri Metham et Anna que “fuit uxor Tho. Metham, Militis, fil. Ri. Metham. Qui quidem Thomas Metham, Miles, fil. Alexandri Metham obiit in festo S. Annae, 26 Julij, A. D. ”1z4z quorum ai'bus,</Q> &amp;c. There is another large flat stone, much broken,
<PB N="465" REF="541"/>with an inscription in the black letter all round the edge, which seems to consist of nothing but a repetition of "Thomas Metham." The burying ground and tombs of these ancient families are suffered to remain uncovered, and be wantonly spoiled.—Leland in his Itinerary tells us▪ that <Q>in the quire lyith one John of “”Hoveden, whom they call a Seinct, one as they say of the first prebendaries there.</Q></P>
<P>We could gain no intelligence of the curious monument spoken of by Mr. Gough, and the ancient authors referred to by him. <Q>Osara, sister of King Osred, had in “Hoveden church, Yorkshire, a tomb of wood—<HI>Tumba lignea in sedis modum super aram eminens.</HI> Girald. Camb. Itin. Camb. L. c. 1. p. 824. Funeral Monu∣ments, p. 46." He lived about the year 1188. "In borealibus Angliae trans∣humbrorum finibus, in ecclesia de Hoveden, rectoris ejusdem ecclesiae concubina, tumbae sanctae Hosannae sororis Regis Osraedi lignae in modum sedis super aram eminente, minus caute insidit; quae cum recedere vellet, sixis ligno natibus, evelli non potuit donec occurente populo, scissis vestibus, et corpore nudato, et crebris disciplinis, usque at sanguinis profluvium, acriter afflictes, cum lacrhimis quoque multis, et supplicationibus, compunctione secuta, et penitentia injuncta, divinitus laxata recessit." Burton says, "After this manner were sound the remains of some earthen pots in the quire of Hoveden church, under the seats, having a hole open into the quire. The diameter of the mouth of one of the pots was five inches and a quarter, the whole diameter twelve inches, the bot∣tom ”nine inches, depth seventeen inches and a half.</Q> We lament that the description of this curious monument closes there. Most probable it belonged to the tomb of Osara. No account could be had of it, when we visited this church.</P>
<P>There are no tombs or inscriptions in the north porch of the quire. The chapter-house adjoins to the south of the quire, with a little chapel, revestry, or oratory, adjoining: the entrance under the third window, the door-way orna∣mented with much carving in stone; a nich on each side for a statue, canopied,
<PB N="466" REF="542"/>and the whole richly adorned with tabernacle work. Over the door of the little chapel, &amp;c. the arms of Skirlaw, Bishop of Durham. Mr. Pennant's notes, in Mr. Grose's work, <Q>Chapter-house, a beautiful octagon, the tracery of the win∣dows “light and fine; the inside has thirty stalls, each under a Gothic arch; both these and the back of the stalls enriched with beautiful sculpture; over the door two rows of six niches each. The roof fallen in, through neglect, ”twenty years ago. Between the windows, on the outside, several shields of arms.</Q> The chapter-house, of eight equal sides, is only eight paces in width; on each side of the door is a seat, which, with four in each other front, make thirty in the whole; the seats are separated by clustered pilasters of various members, very small and extremely delicate, having foliated capitals of pierced work, and from thence rises rich tabernacle work, ornamenting a Gothic arch; the seats are cano∣pied, in imitation of a groined and ribbed arch, terminating in a knot in the centre; and the whole of the back of the seats, up to the canopies, is carved in rose work. There are seven large windows, of three lights each, under pointed arches, with various tracery, light and elegant; the springings of the groins and ribs of a vaulted roof still remain. Above the door are niches for statues, cano∣pied and garnished with tabernacle work, two for superior personages in the centre, and two smaller on each side. These close up the space which should have received the eighth window, if the chapter house had been a detached build∣ing: the tabernacle work, and ornaments of the door-way are elegant: the whole is built of a fine and durable freestone; and, whilst we confess it is the greatest disgrace to suffer this building to go to decay, we acknowledge that we have seen nothing in this island of such elegant work in stone, except at Melross Abbey, in Scotland, with which this small building may justly vie, and in one particular, it excells any part in the Scotch abbey, by its symmetry and exact proportion; be∣ing the most perfect example of Gothic architecture we ever saw.</P>
<P>In the floor is a mutilated inscription, on a chauntry priest of Thomas the martyr.</P>
<P>Had the parish officers laid out the money that was expended in constructing the present vestry room, in repairs of this elegant building, appropriating it to that use, which we conceive would have been a very proper one, they would have demonstrated their taste to futurity, and preserved to the curious traveller the finest monument of antiquity in that part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The outside of the quire has been of much more elegant workmanship than the nave or transept; the chapter-house is supported by a buttrass at each corner, each ornamented with a nich for a statue, and a shield of arms, the arms much defaced, three only to be made out with any degree of probability: the windows are or∣namented with a border of tabernacle work. The east end of the quire is remarkably beautiful, the annexed plate-will convey a just idea, and save much description: the station, from whence the drawing was made, gave a view of the tower, in a very picturesque situation. There are two fine statues yet remaining, one of St. Peter, the other supporting a tabernacle, supposed to be St. Cuthbert, or Skirlaw, who did so much at this edifice, and perhaps rebuilt the chancel, the niches and work of the east end being greatly similar to the chapter-house, which, there is sufficient evidence, was built by him.</P>
<PB N="467" REF="543"/>
<P>The transept is forty paces in length, and eight paces in width, lighted by a large window at each end, and two side windows to the west. The tower rises from pointed arches, supported on clustered pillars. There are three door-ways which led into the quire, the fillets of the arches ornamented with rose work. On each side of the centre gate-way, which now leads into the vestry, are four statues on pedestals, the niches canopied and ornamented with tabernacle work; the figures to the north are habited like females, and perhaps were typical; the first, with a book in the left hand, and a scroll falling to the feet in the right, the bot∣tom seized by a dove, an inscription in the Saxon character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pennant, by following Leland implicitly, has been led into the same adoption. And a writer in the Gentleman's Magazine for January, 1793, after criticising on the author's first volume of this work, and asserting he had. <Q>sought in vain for any mention of Howden in the second volume of the “History of Durham, and (that) he should have been surprised at finding it, as it is not a member of the church of Durham:" after a dark and elaborate groping after shadows▪ concludes, "What I have ”here said proceeds from a desire to rescue Mr. Savage</Q> (the person to whom I have acknowledged my obligations, and who has, or will shortly publish a History of Howden) <Q>from the vagaries of upstart “antiquaries, who seem to delight in new speculations, and unfounded assertions, and bring discredit on ”the science of antiquity, by flourishes of pedantic language.</Q>—This requires no comment; nor doth the author merit other reproof, than to tell it, <HI>that he disgraces the public society to which he belongs.</HI>
<P>W. H.</P></NOTE> IN PRINCIPIO ERAT. The second with a fillet bound over her eyes; on the south side, the figures of Peter and Paul; the first with keys in the right hand, and a tabernacle in the left; the other with a sword. All of them in good preservation. There are pedestals for statues on the sides of the side doors, but no figures remaining. In the tran∣sept are many ancient tomb-stones; some of them appear to have been brought thither of late years, when the pavement was repaired. Leland in the Itinerary, saith, <Q>It apperith by inscription of a very fair stone, <HI>varij marmoris,</HI> that the “bowels of Walter Skirlaw (he built the steeple, and repaired the church, and half of the manor, and dyed 1406) Bisshop of Durham, were buried in How∣den ”chirch</Q> * It is particularly necessary to examine into this palpable error, it having already misguided several; Mr. Gough, in the forementioned work, says, <Q>The bowels of Walter Skirlaw, Bishop of Durham, who died 1405, were “buried at Howden in Yorkshire, where remains a slab with a cross, and this in∣scription, ”<HI>Hic requiescunt viscera Walteri Skirlaw, que sepeliuntur sub hoc, Saxo, Ano Dni</HI> 1405.</Q> Johnson, in 1670, speaks thus of the same monuments, for there is none other to be found in the church, on the strictest inquiry, which should lead to a mistake: <Q>Upon a blue marble grave-stone, with a cross upon it, in the cross “aile, adjoining to the north-west pillar of the steeple, the stone was broken by the Scots; the inscription thus represented in the manuscript:—h<SUP>c</SUP> <HI>REQUIES∣CUNT</HI> VICCRA <HI>WALTERI</HI> DE KIRKHA QVODA DUNOLMIE. S. EPI. ORA. P. AIA."<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The letters in italick are rather defaced.</NOTE> Mr. Burton, from some unaccountable error, "On the north side of the north pillar of the steeple lies an old black coffin, like marble, with a large <HI>cross floree</HI> at top, and insculptured about its verge thus, h<SUP>•</SUP> requiescunt VISCERA ”Jordoni de Metham, &amp;c.</Q> There is no such inscription there: the stone which lies at the north-west pillar is of veined black marble, in the coffin form, and very
<PB N="468" REF="544"/>ponderous and large, the upper edges are canted off, and on the top is a cross floree, and the inscription runs on the narrow margin, given by cutting down the edges; it lies in a dark situation, and the whole inscription is not easily made out on the end and side next to the pillar; the stone is broken in two, by which, and other injuries, the inscription has suffered greatly: but what we attempt to de∣termine the matter by, and confirm Johnson's manuscript from, is the termination of the proper name by characters as distinct as possible, an A with a line of a∣breviation above, to make it <HI>am,</HI> which cannot be applied in any manner to Skirlaw, and appertains properly to Kirkham.—The word <HI>requiescunt</HI> is almost obliterated, <HI>vicera Walter. de</HI> are perfectly legible, then intervenes the break of the stone, and nothing of the proper name is legible, but a fragment of the H, and the A with the mark of abbreviation. We would add, that Kirkham died in 1260, when the Saxon character was chiefly in use; and Skirlaw, in 1405, when it was almost totally disused.</P>
<P>By the south-east pillar of the steeple, is a large altar-tomb, without any inscrip∣tion, sculptured with eight shields of arms, to the east those of Saltmarsh, which induces a belief, that it belonged to one of that family. In the floor, near this tomb, in the Saxon character, Hic jacet Emma de Cimiterio; on another, in the same character, Hic jacet Willielmus Maddi; another, Hic jacet **** de Nandon; another, hic jacet **** Ade, also the name John Pearson. In the black letter, <Q>“Hic jacet Walter de Kirkby, quond. capel. cantarij sancti Cuthbertij qui obut ” **** die mensis marti anno Dni MCCCCLVIJ.</Q></P>
<P>The nave, which, after the mode of several other dissolved collegiate churches, is used for divine service, has two side ailes, and is forty paces in length, and twenty in width, including both ailes; the archings of the east end of the ailes are used for entrances; the centre arch is closed up, for the place of the altar.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is a painting of the Lord's supper fills the bows of the arch.</NOTE> The pillars forming the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les are regular, five on each side, supporting pointed arches; the columns are composed of a cluster of four cilinders, each ribbed in front, the capitals octagonal, the arches of various members, and the whole light well pro∣portioned and beautiful. The church is neatly stalled, and kept in good order; the nave is lighted by three windows to the west, the centre window of four lights; six windows to the north, and three to the south; two being closed up by the school-house, which is built against that front: they are all under pointed arches, and composed of three lights each. The centre aile has a range of upper windows on each side, and an open gallery. There are several ancient tomb-stones on the floor. Mr. Burton notes the following: <Q>In the nave, by the communion table, “lies a white stone, having a chalice engraven at the head and side, with this in∣scription, ”Hic jacet Johannes de Buckden vic. hujus Ecclesiae.</Q> Another inscribed with the name of BRAKENDOLM in the Saxon character, and several other mutilared inscriptions. There were several paintings in the windows, perfect when Mr. Burton visited; <Q>in the first window of the south aile westward, quar∣terly, “first and last barry of six O. and B.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For sable.</NOTE> Constable of Burton, second and third gules; a lion rampant argent. In the third window, gules; three water buckets,
<PB N="469" REF="545"/>argent; Lord Ross, of Hamlake. In the window over the west door, gules; cinquefoil argent. In the first window eastward, sable; a bend ar. cotized Or, inter six lions ramp. of the third. In the second window, gules; an eagle dis∣played, Or,—Quarterly, first and last, gules; a castle, Or; second and third, a ”lion ramp. sable.</Q> The building of the nave is without much ornament, and with heavy buttrasses; the south front greatly injured by the school-house, which is elevated on a vault of stone, and is ascended by several steps. The windows and door-ways of the west end, which Mr. Grose has delineated, are finished with archings of many members, arising from beautiful pilasters; the centre and but∣trasses terminating in lanthorn pinnacles, finished with tabernacle work, which gives it a very uncommon appearance. In niches, there remain two statues, the one supporting a tabernacle, both in good preservation. The tower is a fine struc∣ture, composed of durable stone, not unlike the tower of Durham cathedral, but without the ornaments; said to be 128 feet in height:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We presume this height is given of the tower only, where it rises from the roof of the church.</NOTE> in order to render it con∣spicuous at a great distance, the parishioners are at the expence of scouring the outside; a work which several people were employed in, suspended in cradles, when we saw it. The prospect from the top is as extensive as the eye can reach, much of the adjacent country being a dead level: York minster is very distinctly seen, and a vast sweep of country to the south and west. This erection, by all writers, has been attributed to Bishop Skirlaw; but by the arrangement of shields of arms remaining in the tower, one would conceive, though it was built under the auspices of that prelate, yet that several benefactors had contributed thereto.</P>
<P>Leland in his Itinerary, adds, <Q>The Bishop of Dirham palace lieth on the south “of the chirch, whereof the first part, at the centre is of tymber, the other 3 most ”of stone, and part of bricke.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Certen chirches of Howdenshir, do homage of Hoveden chirch. There is a park by Hoveden, longginge to the Bishop of Duresme, yn the way to Rorese∣hill.”</Q></P>

<P>What remains of the manor-house,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Pennant's Notes in Mr. Grose's Work.</HI>
<P>The mansion house of the Bishops of Durham, who are lords of the manor, is near the east end of the church, once a large pile, some part demolished; several arms here. A great vault, perhaps a cloister, is still standing; behind the house is a large square piece of land moated round; in it is a canal, and several trees, possibly once the garden and orchard.</P></NOTE> is a centre or front, and a wing to the west; to the east are the ruins of several large buildings, with the remains of the ribs and groinings of an extensive vault: over an arch on the west wing, is the arms of Skirlaw; and over a gate, leading out of the yard to the granaries, the arms of Cardinal Langley. The barns or granaries, form a very long range of buildings
<PB N="470" REF="546"/>to the west. Johnson's manuscript states, <Q>that this is a very large manor, and “there is a tradition, that King Henry III. gave it to then Bishop of Durham, for a place of retreat on the incursions of the Scots. This manor hath several petty or inferior manors, which answer thereto, and lie, not only in the parish, but also Walkingham in Ouse, and Derwent wapontac. There are two manors in the town of Howden. Metham manor, sold by Sir Thomas Metham, to Sir Nich. Belt, and by him left to David Belt, his nephew; and by him to his second son, Matthew, who was possessed of it in 1670. Harforth manor, for which, of late, there hath been no court kept, and so it is waved: it was sold by John Harforth to David and Matthew Belt, the latter of whom possessed it, ”A. D. 1670.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Bishop of Durham is lord paramount<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In order to enable Bishop Trevor to repair the damages done to Newcastle bridge, by the floods in 1771, and to indemnify himself against the great charges of that work, he obtained an act of parliament in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8th year or his present majesty, to enable him to infranchise the copyholders of this manor; but the excessive rate laid down for that purpose, has deterred many from receiving the proposed advantage.</NOTE> of the town and lands within the liberties of Howdenshire. King Henry III. granted the bishop the privi∣lege of having felons goods, <HI>felo de so,</HI> wreck de maris, tollage and lastage, of having a clerk of the market, a coroner, executio brevium, Fines de Banco et de Scaccar. coram justic. et assis. coram justicionis de pace. In the same, the privileges of Allerton are comprehended. The bishop's extent of the river ”Ouse, is from Cawood to Melton.</Q>—<HI>So far our author.</HI></P>
<P>The manor-house was the favourite residence of several of our greatest prelates; and Howden was a liberty, in which they exercised an extensive jurisdiction. The magnificent prelate, Hugh Pudsey, died here in the year 1195, and was carried, for interment, to the cathedral church of Durham.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hugo Episcopus Dunelm. A.

<P>Mr. Burton's MS. proceeds with an account of the towns within the parish of Howden, extracted from Johnson's work; and which we will give in the form Mr. Burton has inserted it.</P>
<P>BARNBY UPON THE MARSH, a chapelry three miles west from Howden: a con∣stablery. Cert. val. 2 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>—ECTON.</P>
<P>ASSELBY, two miles west, a constablery. This town contains six carucates of land, held of the Bishop of Durham. The tithes thereof belonged to the prebend of Barnby, within the collegiate church of Howden.</P>
<P>KNEDLINGTON, a mile west, a constablery. This town contains six carucates of land, held of the fee of the Bishop of Durham. The tithes whereof belonged to the prebend of Hoveden.</P>
<P>There is a hamlet called BOOTH, where there is a ferry belonging to the Bishop of Durham. This was formerly only a little cottage for a fisherman and ferryman; but in 1670, several houses had been built there.</P>
<P>BARNEHILL, a farm-house, which was an ancient house of the Methams, and was moated about.</P>
<P>THORPE AND BELBY, two several constableries, N. E. a mile. This town con∣tained two carucates of land of the fee of the Bishop of Durham. The tithes thereof belonged to the prebend of Thorpe.</P>
<P>BALCOLME, N. E. about a mile, a manor formerly belonging to the Methams; Sir Thomas sold it to Thomas and Lawrence Althorp: Thomas, son of Robert, second son of the aforesaid Thomas, possessed it A. D. 1670.—Here are two caru∣cates and two oxgangs of land, held of the fee of the Bishop of Durham. The tithes thereof belonged to the prebend of Thorp.</P>
<P>EAST AND WEST LINTON, lying N. E. These join to Balcolme, and belong to the constablery of Bellash, in the parish of Estrington. A manor called East Linton manor, is held de rege p. serv. mil. but all the rest in Howdenshire is held of the Bishop of Durham in free and common socage. Mr. Michael Wharton, in 1670, was lord of the manor, which was purchased by his father Lawrence of —Tankred. These are only two houses.</P>
<P>DUNCOTE, N. E. a single house.</P>
<P>Part of NEWLAND, N. E. These towns lie altogether, that one would think they made only one town. The west part of Newland only belongs to this parish, the east side being in Estrington parish.</P>
<P>SKELTON, S. E. a mile. Sand-Hall is part of Skelton, anciently belonging to the Girlingtons; it stands near, and is almost enclosed by the river Ouse. It belonged (1670) to Leonard Thompson, Alderman of York, whose father, Alderman Henry Thompson, purchased it of Mr. Walter Blackeston, and he of the widow of Sir John Girlington, neice and heir of Nicholas Girlington.</P>
<P>KILPING, S. E. a mile: the tithes hereof belonged to the prebend of Thorp.</P>
<P>LAXTON, a chapelry, two miles east. A manor. There are three manors be∣longing to this, viz. 1st, Formerly belonging to Thomas Metham, who sold it to
<PB N="474" REF="550"/>David Belt, and Mr. Fletcher bought it of him, and Mr. Wilkinson of York bought it of his heir, who, in 1670, possessed it.—2d, Higdon manor, possessed in 1670 by Mr. Lawrence Higdon: the 3d, Lowson's manor, possessed by the Fulthorps. This town contains three carucates of land, held of the fee of the Bishop of Durham; the rent 6 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann: it gives name with the town of Skelton to a prebend within the collegiate church of Hoveden. Here is a chapel to Hoveden, not certified.—ECTON.</P>
<P>METHAM, S. E. three miles: a manor always in the possession of that ancient family, held of the fee of the Bishop of Durham, by the rent of 16 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> per ann. and fealty for all services (it is called 22 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> in another place.) The tithes thereof belonged to the prebend of Saltmarsh.</P>
<P>COTNESS, S. E. three miles. Here were twelve oxgangs of land, held of the fee of the Bishop of Durham: the tithes whereof belonged to the prebend of Saltmarsh.</P>
<P>YEWKEFLETE, S. E. three miles and a half. Here are two manors, one belonged to the king, and was purchased by one Kingeroft, but the charge being greater than the profits, he waved it. The other manor anciently belonged to Thomlins; in 1670, in possession of widow Smith, a daughter of Thomlins. Mr. Burton calls this Inflete or Ynflete. This town was held of the prior of Finchale, by the family of the Methams, by the rent of 6 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR>: the tithes belonged to the prebend of Saltmarsh.</P>
<P>SALTMARSH, S. E. three miles: a constablery. This was the ancient seat of the Saltmarshes, and in 1670, was possessed by Philip Saltmarsh, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>
<P>To these towns Mr. Burton adds—</P>
<P>SAYERDYKE or TRANDYKES, in which one carucate of land was held of the fee of the Bishop of Durham: the tithes whereof belonged to the prebend of Thorp.</P>
<P>SANDAL and MUTTOFTHOUSE.</P>
<P>Mr. Burton proceeds to give an account of the several churches and chapels, subordinate to Howden, thus:—</P>

Likewise he ordained, that the said prebendary have to his prebend, a perpetual vicar, there personally to reside, and have cure of souls; to whom should be assigned for his portion, the vicarage house and yard, and all the oblations, obventions, and profits whatsoever, as well of the altar of Skipwith as of the chapel within the same; and all other small tithes, viz. wool, lamb, calves, cheese, line hens, and of the mills, which now are, or hereafter shall be within the said parish: also two oxgangs of land in Duffield, and all other tithes of the whole parish, excepting the predial tithes of garbs, and the tithe of hay of Duffield; also the tithe of hay of Menthorp and Skipwith, and all the mortuaries happen∣ing within the same parish: in consideration of which, the said vicar should

<HEAD>Hemingburgh, dedicated to St. Mary.</HEAD>
<P>Discharged.—In the Archdeaconry of Cleveland, and Bulmer Deanry.</P>
<P>King William the Conqueror gave to the Bishop of Durham this his royal manor and town of Hemingburgh, and the church thereof, together with all his land at Brakenholme, with all those royal customs and liberties, which it formerly had, when Tostins and Siward held it: to be holden of the king in capite. <HI>Mon. Angl.</HI> vol. I. p. 45. Thus the bishop being seized of it, granted three carucates of land in the town to the prior and convent of Durham, to be holden de rege in capite. The valuation in Ecton is 28 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>—in Doomsday Book <HI>"Presbyter et Ecclesia."</HI>—This grant of the conqueror hath both a seal pendant to it, and is signed by the witnesses with crosses in the Saxon manner.</P>
<P>This church, which was then a great rectory, was also given to the said prior and convent, and their successors, who have ever since been patrons of it. On 19th July, 1356, this parish church was appropriated to the prior and convent of Durham, (of whose patronage it was) by John, Archbishop of York, who, in re∣compence of the damage the church of York had sustained thereby, reserved out of the fruits thereof, to him and his successors archbishops, an annual pension of 66 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> and to the dean and chapter of York, another annual pension of 3 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 8 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> to be paid by the said prior and convent for ever. On the 21st day of July, 1356, the archbishop ordained a perpetual vicarage in this parish church, appointing the vicar thereof to be at the presentation of the prior and convent of Durham, who should set out for his habitation a competent house, with its curtelage and garden, near the said church, and pay him and his successors 40 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> sterling per ann. at Martinmas and Pentecost, by equal portions; in respect of which he shall bear all burthens, ordinary incumbent on the church, excepting the building or repairs of the quire; and all other extraordinary duties, which the said prior and convent should bear. <HI>Mon. Angl.</HI> vol. IV. p. 97. But notwith∣standing all this, as it seems the said ordination was invalid, and the king's licence granted thereupon was never executed, by reason that the prior and convent of Durham could not procure the pope's confirmation; and that certain other per∣sons, from time to time, had the said church in possession, by virtue of the provi∣sions from the apostolic fee. <HI>Mon. Angl.</HI> vol. III. p. 97.—</P>
<P>26th October, 1426, 5th King Henry VI. The king granted his royal licence to the prior and convent of Durham, to erect, or cause the parochial church of Hemmingburgh to be erected into a college, consisting of one provost or warden, and of three prebendaries, six vicars, six clerks, and other ministers, to celebrate therein divine service, for the good estate of himself whilst he lived, and for his soul after his decease, and for the souls of his royal progenitors, viz. King Edw. I. King Edw. III.; and also yearly to keep their anniversary day, whereon they should distribute alms amongst the poor. Furthermore, granting that the said provost, prebendaries, vicars, and clerks, be for ever called the provost, preben∣daries, vicars, and clerks of the collegiate church or college of Hemyngburgh, and be persons perpetual and capable to purchase lands for ever, having first obtained the king's licence thereunto: and also have a common seal for transacting the affairs of their church or college; and also by that name sue and be sued in all
<PB N="484" REF="560"/>causes and actions whatsoever. <HI>Mon. Ang.</HI> vol. IV. p. 97, 98. In Nov. 1426, John Kempe, Archbishop of York, made his ordination of this parochial church, accordingly, as shall be particularized hereafter, reserving to the prior and convent of Durham an annual pension of five marks, anciently due out of the church of Hemyngburgh, and the presentation of the provost, canons, vicars, &amp;c. within the space of one month from their vacations, &amp;c. and on the 19th May, 1427, the chapter of York consented to the erection of the same into a collegiate church, so that the members thereof submit to a former ordination made by John, Archbishop of York, in 1356.</P>
<P>In Nov. 1426, the archbishop ordained, at the appropriation of this church to the prior and convent of Durham, that it be a college to consist of one provost or warden, who should be a canon of the same, and be constituted in priest's orders before he obtained the said provostship, and to have the whole care of the parishioners souls, and full government of the fruits, rents, and revenues of the same church, and to be liable to support the following incumbrances, of paying the canons and vicars, &amp;c. and shall, for the greatest part of the year, make his personal residence in the said church; and have for his portion forty marks per ann. out of the fruits and profits of the church.</P>
<P>20th March, 1479, Lawrence, Archbishop of York, made this new ordination of this collegiate church, that the provost thereof, who should have principal care both in spirituals and temporals, should keep residence in the same, at least thirteen weeks in the year; and should receive all and singular the fruits, rents, and profits thereunto appertaining, and have the mansion house of the rectory, with the whole soil remaining besides the mansion house of the vicars; and should pay the canons, vicars, and other ministers their salaries.</P>
<P>In the year 1426, at the erection of this church to be collegiate, the arch∣bishop ordained, that there should be therein, besides the provost, three other canons, prebendaries; to each of which the said provost was to pay yearly ten marks <HI>nomine prebendae,</HI> at the annual feasts of Christmas, Lady-day, St. John Baptist, and St Michael, by equal portions; every one of whom was to reside personally thirteen weeks in a year, from the feast of St. Michael, either continually, or by turns, and to receive of the provost at the end of the year ten marks <HI>nomine residentiae.</HI> Moreover in 1479, by Archbishop Lawrence it was ordained, the provost was to pay 2 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 13 <ABBR>s</ABBR> 4 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> per ann. to each canon for the corpse of his prebend.</P>

<P>In the year 1425, at the ordination of this church, the archbishop decreed, that there should also be therein six vicars, whereof two were to be chaplains of the chauntries of Clyff and Wasse, which said vicars of Clyff and Wasse should go to masses, and other canonical hours, in the habit conformable to the other vicars, each of which should receive yearly, by the hands of the provost, two marks quarterly, in augmentation of their sustentation. And besides these two, he ordained, that there be in the said church other four vicars ministring in regular habits, who, according to the ordination and command of the provost should have under him the labour of the exercise of the cure of the parishioners souls of Hemyngburgh; and have each of them for his portion ten marks per ann. paid them by the provost at the four terms in the year; and every one of these should be ebdomidaries, according to the order of their turn: and in 1479, by a new decree, these vicars should have to their proper use for ever the one moiety of the tithable fuel, called Faggots or Kydds, which should be cut down yearly within the parish of Hemynburgh.</P>
<P>In 1426, besides the provost, canons, and vicars, there were ordained in this collegiate church, four clerks of the second form, besides two clerks carrying water, which should be nominated by the provost, and at his pleasure removed: and the <HI>Aquae Bajuli</HI> clerks should be nominated by the parishioners, as they were wont of ancient time, having in augmentation of their stipends, and to make them more diligent in their divine ministrations, one mark per annum paid by the provost.</P>
<P>CLYFF'S CHAUNTRY. There was a chauntry ordained in this church, at the altar of St. Mary the Virgin, for the soul of Henry de Clyff, canon of the cathedral church of York, who died 1332, which consisted of two chaplains daily celebra∣ting thereat. The patronage of whom was, after the decease of the said Henry de Clyff and his executors, given to the prior and convent of Durham: and on the 20th of March, 1479, the chaplain of this chauntry of Clyff was to have 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR>

<P>On Gateshead-fell several quarries are wrought for <HI>grindstones,</HI> which are ex∣ported to various parts of the world.—In one year there were exported from Newcastle to Denmark and Norway 247 cwt.—Flanders 2 cwt.—France 467 cwt.—Germany 139 cwt.—Guernsey 4 cwt.—Jersey 12 cwt.—Holland 560 cwt.—Poland 12 cwt.—Prussia 155 cwt.—Russia 66 cwt.—Sweden 15 cwt.—and to the West Indian islands 2 cwt.—besides what were sent coastways.—A large quantity of rubstones and gun-flints are also yearly exported, the produce of this district.</P>
<P><HI>Millstones</HI> have been got on the moors above Egleston; near Wolsingham, in large gritstones, or granites, found in the morasses.</P>
<P><HI>Black marble</HI> is wrought from a quarry at Fosterly, near Wolsingham, in Weardale, thick set with white coralloid <HI>fungitae</HI> in all directions, being the <HI>mar∣mor nigrum coraltis refertum of Da Costa.

<P>The <HI>Belamnitae, Trochitae, Entrochoi, Asleriae,</HI> are found in the banks of the river Tees, in a bed of black chiver or schale, as the miners call it, and in various other parts of this county; among the rocks in Holy Island they are found of a consider∣able size, and the joints of the Entrochoi are there called St. Cuthbert's beads.—Ray. Phyl. Letters, p. 113. Lithologists of great character differ in their opinions concerning their origin. Dr. Lister (Ph. Tra. No. 100.) Mr. Beaumont (Ph. Tra.

<P><HI>Kelton stone.</HI> Of a pale brown colour, composed of incrusted granules, resem∣bling the roe fish: this species contains some clay, and a small quantity of iron. It is found in great abundance at Boyden-Hill, near Sunderland.</P>
<P>Of spars there is great variety. Of the opaque, which is rhomboidal, hexan∣gular. triangular, or gobular, and of various colours, found in the lead mines, and of the diaphonous, which is rhomboidal, triangular, hexangular, pyramidal, or columnar, also found in the lead mines. A curious specimen was found in the coal mines, near Durham, columnar, and beautifully fluted, about three inches in
<PB N="493" REF="569"/>diameter, black and opaque, and intersected at intervals about the distance of an inch and a half with a joint, at which the column would separate and divide. In the mines in Teesdale the honeycomb spar is found, in fleaks like the leaves of the honeycomb in the hive, bedded in clay, and unconnected with any other matter; it is opaque, of a dusky blue colour nearly black, and the perforations of different sizes, from about an inch over to the fourth of an inch; quintangular like the honeycomb.—The <HI>stalactical spar, isicle</HI> or <HI>dropstone,</HI> is found in many limestone quarries, and on the rocks on which the Castle of Barnard is built, and other places.</P>
<P><HI>Arsenic</HI> is found in the lead mines. Dr. Edwards had several fine specimens, incrustrations, like the Bristol stones.</P>
<P><HI>Cockles</HI> are found in the limestones about Barnard Castle, and some will separate in a perfect state; the valves closed.</P>
<P>Part of the horn of a red deer was taken by the author from a block of freestone, got in Stainton-Hill quarries.</P>
<P>In several stones in Mr. Dixon's possession at Cockfield are the impressions of ferns and other plants; in one an American fern, in high relief; they are found in the nodules of iron stone by the miners called <HI>Catsheads,</HI> and in other lumps of dark blue stone; they split with a slight stroke, at the very place or bed of the plant, after being exposed to the winter, and shew the vegetable lineaments in great beauty. The impression of the American fern is remarkable, from having some of the leaves compressed and bent back.</P>
<P>Large trees have been found in the morasses, of different kinds, rendered very hard, and preserved perfectly sound by the astringent quality of the moss water.—Hazel nuts, acorns, and mast of firs, are found in the peats, which are cut and sold for fuel. On the sea shore, near Seaton, within watermark, known by the ancient name of Seaton pasture, large trees are found bedded in the clay and moss earth there. The trees thus found are seldom discovered with roots; which gives an apprehension that they were burnt down.</P>
<P>Several kinds of vegetable substances are found petrified, or incrusted with calcareous matter in the dropping springs at Sledwish, near Barnard Castle, simi∣lar to those found at Knaresborough, in Yorkshire.</P>
<P>In the freestone quarries at Durham, which were wrought for stones for the new bridge, was found an entire fish, in figure like the bream, embodied in a large block of stone—in separating it, the fins and tail were broken off.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dendrites,</HI> representing shrubs, plants, or moss, on thin shells of limestone, found at Boiden-Hill, near Sunderland. The most beautiful are like the sea mosses, and seem to be depicted by some fossil fluid or vapour.</P>
<P>A species of <HI>Helmintholithus,</HI> called <HI>Tubiporous,</HI> is found on the shore near Sun∣derland, being a congeries of coalline tubes, parallel or variously curved; found fiequently loose in different strata, and often immersed in stone.—<HI>Syst.

<P>The mines of coal and lead are subjects worthy of our chief attention, and of
<PB N="494" REF="570"/>great importance in the county of Durham. The use of coal was for several ages paid little attention to, from the disagreeable stench and smoak which it produced, where chimneys were not properly adapted, and whilst wood was abundant in the country. It has been the opinion of some learned writers, that the working of coal was of higher antiquity, than the time of the Romans in Britain; and that it was the object of British commerce soon after their arrival, and this idea seems to be founded chiefly on the circumstance, that in the discovery of hippocausts and vaults, where remains of sacrifice have been found, attributed to the Romans, there were appearances of the refuse of coal sires, and in digging up the foundations of <HI>Caervorran,</HI> on the wall, in 1762, coal cinders were found, which still burnt in the fire: but those evidences are not conclusive, for it is certain, the walled forts of the Romans were possessed by various successors, and they in later ages might use coals. True it is, the Saxons and Danes were busied in warfare, yet their domestic occasions would lead them to so very useful an article as coal, which they would discover, in many places, where the veins break out to the day, shewing them∣selves in the strata of cliffs and precipices. We are not told where the seams of coal were first wrought to any considerable degree, and perhaps in Durham and Northumberland mining did not advance rapidly till after the fourteenth century; for in the reign of King Edward III. the governor of Berwick was obliged to send for men skilled in mining from the forest of Dean, and the more southern parts, to assist him in retaking that town from the Scotch.</P>
<P>Mr. Horsley, treating of the inscriptions found at Benwell, says, <Q>there is a “colliery not far from that place, a part of which is judged by those bestskilled ”in such affairs, to have been wrought by the Romans.</Q> We should be glad to know how a proper distinction can be made, by which to determine what is British, Roman, or Saxon work, without some instruments were found in the workings, to denote the people. Caesar, in what he writes of the Natural History of Britain, only says, <Q>The inland countries afford tin, and the maritime iron, “”though no great plenty of it.</Q> We may naturally deduce from thence, that the inhabitants he sound, even on the shores, did not burn coal. In the correspon∣dence between Sir John Clerk and Roger Gale, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> on this subject, we find seve∣ral remarks worth transmitting to the reader. Sir John, in his letter of the 8th Dec. 1739, from Edenburg, addressed to Mr. Gale, says, <Q>Being a coal-master “of near forty years experience, our philosophical society expects a dissertation from me on coals, &amp;c. I found that Sir Robert Atkins's assertion of coal being to be seen round the world, by a line from the mouth of Severn to Newcastle, is mentioned (Hist. of Gloucestershire, p. 30) in the fourth iter of your friend Dr. Stukeley's Itin. Curios. p. 60; and that the strata of coal are found and wrought in the bishoprick of Liege, and passed westward by Great Britain and Ireland. As to the coal in China, the abstract we have of the missionaries letters, vol. I. p. 22, takes notice, that no country in the world abounds more with coal, but I suppose they mean only the north of China, so that indeed coal does seem to be the product of a northern climate, from perhaps, 46 to the; 6th de∣gree of latitude; so far has nature provided against cold. I have heard of coal ”in the north of America, but have never seen any printed account of it.</Q> Mr.
<PB N="495" REF="571"/>Gale's answer, dated from Scruton, 26th Feb. 1739-40, says, <Q>This is a subject “scarcely yet touched, though so necessary to be understood: I know of no author that has expressly handled it; Dr. Plott, indeed, in his History of Staffordshire, and Mr. Robinson, in his Natural History of Westmorland and Cumberland, have something of it, but superficial, with poor reasoning in their philosophy. The last account that I have met with of this nature, is given by Mr. Strachy, in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 360 and 391. As to the antiquity of working coal about Newcastle, the intestine wars among the Britons and Saxons and afterwards of the Saxons among themselves, which were almost continual, besides the invasions of the Danes, and the wars with Scotland for three or four reigns after the Norman conquest, during which time this country, as may be said, was always under fire and sword, together with its never being mentioned in history, makes me think it was not followed, till about the time of Henry III. The first mention I have seen of coal-working there, is in a history of the town of Newcastle, published in the year 1736, p. 158, where it is said they had a grant from Hen. III. to dig coals in Castlefield and the Frith, dated in the 23d year of his reign, A. D. 1239. <HI>Carbomarinus</HI> is also mentioned by Matthew Paris, A. D. 1245; but the working of coal may have been much earlier in other parts of this kingdom, a flint ax having been found in some veins of coal, exposed to sight in a rock, called <HI>Craig-y-Park,</HI> in Monmouthshire; which, as they laid open to-day, might very well be discovered and wrought by the people that used such tools, the ancient Britons, as I suppose. The counties in Eng∣land producing coal, are Cumberland, Westmorland, Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire, chiefly the West Riding, Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Notting∣hamshire, Leicestershire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire, Gloucester∣shire, Somersetshire, North and South Wales. As the strata of coal generally lie bedded between two other strata of stone, and rise and dip in parallel lines with them, they seem to me coeval with the texture of the globe, and to have undergone the same concussions that it has suffered; it being hard to conceive, how soft earth, included between two such solid bodies, should imbibe a sulphu∣reous or bituminous matter, from, or through them: there is, indeed, such a sulphureous matter found in the coal-works; but to me it appears much more reasonable to think it was shut up at the same time with other substances, than enter into the composition of coal. The strata of coal seem to lie within a very small compass on the globe. I have met with an observation, that if a line is drawn from the mouth of Severn to Newcastle, and so round the earth, that all coal will be found to lie within a very small distance of it, on one side or other: but the observation is erroneous. The coal sound in Europe, at least, the furthest distant eastward, is, I believe about Liege, and westward in the mountains of Kilkenny in Ireland, both within 250 miles of it: but I think there was no occasion to stretch the line round the world; for all the coal we know of is contained within the latitudes of our own island, except what I re∣member to have heard affirmed some years ago in the House of Commons, upon the debate about the bill of commerce with France, should prove me mistaken, by which the Isle of Cape Briton was given up to that crown, and said to abound with excellent coal; but as I could never since meet with a confirmation
<PB N="496" REF="572"/>of the assertion, I must question the truth of it. I cannot say any thing as to coal being the common fuel of China,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Hans Sloan says in his Voyage to Jamaica, that there is a kind of fine coal in Barbadoes, and in his return, that they took a French ship bound to Canada for coals.
<P>The Irish mines lately discovered, if the relation is true, appear to be very ancient; but we do not confide in the account.</P></NOTE> not having the Missionary Letters by me, or read that book. There is a tradition at London, that Blackheath, above Greenwich, is full of coal, but not permitted to be wrought, for the encourage∣ment of navigation and the Newcastle trade, which, I dare say, is false; this I am sure of, that there is no law against it; and though the heath belongs to the crown, and no king gave leave to dig it, yet it is strange, that none of the neighbouring land-owners should ever be allured by the vast profits it would bring them, to search for coal, and work it there, when found in their own estates. I suppose the act of Henry V. you hint at, is that in his 9th year, for 2d. a-chaldron of coals, to be paid by such as are not infranchised, and for the measurement of keels. The author of the Newcastle history says, that in the 1st of Edward iii's statutes, mention is made, de Carbonibus maritimis, but I can∣not find it in any of our statute books, though I have the first that was ever ”printed.</Q></P>
<P>The use of coals prevailed in London in the latter end of the reign of King Edward I. <Q>when brewers, dyers, and other artificers, using great fires, began to “use sea coal, instead of dry wood and charcoal, in and near the city of London; the prelates, nobles, commons, and other people of the realm, resorting thither to parliaments, and upon other occasions with the inhabitants of the city, South∣wark, Wapping, and East Smithfield, complained thereof twice, one after ano∣ther, to the king, as a public nuisance, corrupting the air with stink and smoke, to the great prejudice and detriment of their health; whereupon the king first prohibited burning of sea coal by his proclamation, which being disobeyed by many of their private lucre; the king, upon their second complaint, issued a com∣mission of oyer and terminer, to enquire of all such who burned sea coal against his proclamation within the said city, or parts adjoining to it, and to punish them, for the first offence, by great fines and ransoms; and for the second offence, to demolish their furnaces and kilns wherein they burnt sea coal, and to see his proclamation strictly observed for times to come, (though since it is the fuel principally used by them, and all sorts of persons in and near the city, and else∣where, and is no ways reputed a public nuisance) as this record in 35th Edward ”I. informs us.</Q> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prynn's Animadversions on Cooke's Institutes.—In 1379, we find that their use was not only tole∣rated, but their consumption made beneficial to the state; for in that year, a duty of sixpence per ten, each quarter of a year, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imposed on ships coming from Newcastle.—PENNANT, vol.

<PB N="497" REF="573"/>by the king's officers, to prevent frauds on the duty; and the penalty of carrying in unmarked vessels was the forfeiture thereof. The arrears of this duty were de∣manded by Queen Elizabeth; on which a petition was presented, praying a char∣ter to be granted, and which was granted accordingly, to incorporate a new fraternity, to be called <HI>Free Hoastmen,</HI> for the selling and vending of all coals for shipping; in consideration of which, twelvepence a-chaldron was to be paid to the queen and her successors, for every chaldron exported from Newcastle. This duty was afterwards settled by King Charles II. on the Duke of Richmond and his issue. By a statute made in the 21st year of King Henry VIII. <Q>No person shall “ship, load, or unload, any goods to be sold into, or from any ship at any place within the river of Tyne, between the places called Sparhawk and Hedwin streams, <HI>but only at the town of Newcastle;</HI> and if any such be shipped, loaded, or unloaded elsewhere, the same shall be forfeited to the king, to be seized by the ”mayor of Newcastle, who is to account for the value of such, into the exchequer.</Q> By the statute of 30th King Charles II. commissioners are to be appointed by the king for measuring and marking all keels and other boats and carts, and wains, for the carriage of coals in the port of Newcastle upon Tyne, &amp;c. by the bowl-tub of Newcstale.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The following calculations are not so clear as the author could have wished, and it is doubtful, some of them are not perfectly correct.

<P>The quantity of a tenn of coals is uncertain, not being always the same, but commonly sixteen New∣castle chaldrons make a tenn, two keels also make a tenn, and 11 waggons a keel, each waggon contains 19 bolls and upwards; at 36 gallons to a boll, and nine bolls, or thereabouts, go to a fother, and three fothers and a quarter make a chaldron; 21 corves to a score, and 55 fothers make a tenn.</P>
<P>A square yard of solid coal contains eight bolls.</P>
<P>An acre of ground contains 4840 square yards of solid coal, which is nearly equal to 68 tenns, at 16 chaldrons to a tenn, which is nearly equal to 1088 chaldrons of coals. Three square yards and a quarter go to a chalder.—PENNANT ET ALS.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>It is impossible to obtain any calculation, what quantity of coals are entered at the port of Newcastle, from the works in the county of Durham, they are received by the officers there indiscriminately; about sixty-two thousand Newcastle chal∣drons of coals are yearly received at Derwent Haugh, to work, lead, and deliver which, upwards of six hundred men and boys are employed, and about four hun∣dred horses, together with two hundred keelmen, to navigate them down the river to the shipping. This is but a small branch of the trade, but it will serve to shew the reader its consequence, by comparison. It has been alleged, that waggon ways were first used on the river Wear soon after the revolution, by Mr. Allan of Flats, near Chester; but that was subsequent considerably to the waggon ways on the Tyne, made by Colonel Liddel, which extended from Dunstal to Ravenswath, to this time called the Old Way; he was joined in the coal by Charles Montague, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Stella, and from that copartnership originated the combination, called the <HI>Grand Alliance.</HI></P>

<P>In the life of Sir Francis North, who went the northern circuit, in or before the year 1676, it is said, <Q>The manner of the carriages is by laying rails of timber “from the coalliery down to the river, exactly straight and parallel, and bulky carts are made with four rollers fitting those rails, whereby the carriage is so easy, that one horse will draw down four or five chaldrons of coals, and it is an ”immense benefit to the coal merchants.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Lord Guildford, p. 136.</NOTE> To the foregoing description, we must add, that in order to carry the level forward, immense works are frequently made of masonry or soil across valleys and rivulets, touching which, the reader will recollect the description of Causey Bridge, near Tanfield, vol. II. p. 423; not far from Chester are others erected by Mr. Jolliff, at an immense expence, and several more are to be seen in this county: Darwenthaugh waggon-way, extend∣ing from Burnopfield and Brian's Leap to the river Derwent, was the most difficult and expensive work of the kind hitherto executed in the coal trade.— where the descents are easy, the carriages run without horses, and sometimes with that rapidity, that a piece of wood, called a <HI>convoy,</HI> is obliged to be applied to one wheel, and pressed thereon by the attendant who sits on it, to retard the motion; by the friction of which the carriage is hindered from running amain. The waggons proceed to the staiths or repositories at the water side, where a platform of timber is constructed to receive them, and the bottom of the vehicle, which is sitted as a door, with hinges on one side, and a hasp on the other, to fasten it to the sole of the waggon, being opened or let down, the load is instantly dischar∣ged, either into keels below, or into the staith, where they lie under cover, and are ready to be cast into the keels, when the tide or trade does not suit the arrival of the waggons from the remoter collieries.

<P>The reader will revert to the account given of the lead trade in Teasdale.</P>
<P>Of the lead won in this part of the county, we have obtained the following account:—A bing of ore is 8 cwt. and upon an average 4 ¼ bings, or 34 cwt. of ore will produce 21 cwt. of lead.—A fother of lead at Newcastle is 21 cwt. and will produce seven, eight, nine, and sometimes ten ounces of silver; but if it yields under seven ounces and a half, or eight ounces, it will not pay the expence of refining, when lead is 16 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the fother.—The strata or bearing sills are various, which carry ore, the grey post bears well, but the best is the great limestone, both for quantity and quality; which is about 70 fathoms in thickness. Veins, as they are called by leadminers, are in coal-works called dykes, and are certain joints or shakes in the earth, where the several strata are disjoined, and placed in a

varied or dislocated position, as in the example; and in the joint or shake is found the lead ore or mine. On the sides of the vien, and amongst the chiver, are often found foules of a transparent nature, and other matter of a chrystaline quality, some of which, on a chemical process, produce arsenic.— Ore, upon an average, is won for about 20 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> a bing.</P>
<P>The wharfs at Stella and Bladon receive the greatest part of the lead which comes down the Tyne. The proprietors are the London company, called the Quakers' company, the heirs of Sir Thomas Blacket, Bart. and Henry Errington, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and company.—The smelt mills are chiefly on Derwent river, at Whitfield, Jeffreys, and Acton, belonging to the London company; Dukesfield, Allonheads, and Rookhope, belonging to the heirs of Sir Thomas Blacket; and Feldon, nigh Edmundbyers, belonging to Mr. Erring∣ton, &amp;c. Sir Thomas's heirs have a refinery at Bladon.— The yearly receipt of lead, on an average, at the above wharfs, is sixty thousand pieces, of twelve stone each, or thereabout.—There are about ninety-three horse carriages constantly employed to bring down the lead, each carrying ten pieces at a time.</P>
<P>Dr. Watson, in his Chemical Essays, vol. III. has given an accurate account of the methods, both ancient and modern, of smelting lead ore, and extracting the silver, as also the process of preparing white and redlead, to which we must refer the reader, as an abridgement would not be doing justice to the learned author.</P>
<P>In the year 1775, 697,608 chaldrons of coals were imported in the port of London from Newcastle and Sunderland, which was 37,237 chaldrons more than in the year 1773, and 77,237 chaldrons more than in the year 1774. In the year 1776, 600,000 chaldrons were imported at London. The average number of pieces of lead which are sent to Bladon, from the western mines in the county of Durham, is about 100,000, and about 30,000 more come to Swall-well, Newcastle, &amp;c. chiefly from this county. The chief articles of produce of this county, exported from Newcastle, are coals, lead, and grindstones, and of the manufactories of iron, those we have stated for one year, in a table given in the notes.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>Dr. Watson (p. 357) says, <Q>It has with some men been a subject of apprehen∣sion, “lest all the coal-pits in England should soon become exhausted. The quantity of coal which is annually raised is certainly very great; and, as coal is not found to grow again, the time must come when it will all be consumed. It
<PB N="500" REF="576"/>will enable the reader to form some notion of the great excavations which are annually made in this island from the digging of coal, if we calculate the extent of that which is made in one year, in consequence of the coal which is imported ”into London.</Q> The following account may be relied on:—</P>

<P><Q>“No accounts are kept at the custom-house, distinguishing the importation from Newcastle, Sunderland, Blythe, Hartlepool, &amp;c. or from several parts in Scotland and Wales. It appears, from the preceding account, that in the year 1777, there were imported into the port of London 697,435 chalders, and we learn from another authority (<HI>ann. reg.</HI> 1777, ch. 161) that in the same year there were imported from Newcastle and Sunderland alone 692,093 ¾ chalders; by comparing these numbers, we may observe how small a portion of the coal ”consumed in London is brought from any other quarter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“A chalder of coals, Newcastle measure, is allowed by act of parliament (6th and 7th William and Mary, ch. 10) to weigh fifty-three hundred weight; and as eight Newcastle chalders are equal to fifteen London chalders, reckoning thirty-six Winchester bushels to the London chalder, it follows, that a chalder of coals, London measure, is equal to little more than twenty-eight hundred weight. By supposing twenty-eight hundred weight to be the weight of a London chalder—then, as the medium quantity of coal annually imported into London is 658,853 chalders, it may be collected, that there are annually ”imported 922,394 tons.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The medium weight of a cubic foot of the several coals (specified in a table) being 1336 averdupois ounces, a cubic yard, or twenty-seven cubic feet of coal, will weigh 2254 ½ averdupois pounds; there are 2240 such pounds in a ton; hence we may say in general, that a cubic yard of pit coal weighs a ton; some sorts of coal weigh a few pounds more, and others a few pounds less than a ton. From what has been before observed, concerning the quantity of coal annually imported into London, we may conclude, that 922,394 cubic yards of coal are annually dug out of the earth for the supply of the London market. This quantity of coal, if spread to the thickness of an inch, would cover an area of ”above ten miles square.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The great Hosfman had given it as his opinion, that the <HI>peripneumony,</HI> the dry <HI>asthma,</HI> and the <HI>consumption,</HI> were common maladies amongst the inhabitants
<PB N="501" REF="577"/>of Liege and London, and that they were occasioned by the great use of pit coal in those places. M. Morand, in 1769, was at the trouble to inquire into this matter, and it appears, from the attestations of the College of Physicians in Lon∣don, of the Faculty of Medicine at Paris, of the Physicians at Liege, at Lyons, and other places, that the opinion concerning the peculiar insalubrity of pit coal ”fires is utterly without foundation.</Q></P>
<P>We must not quit the subject without noticing the <HI>fire-damps</HI> which affect the mines: no security has yet been discovered against this tremendous phenomenon, in these parts; in the deep workings at Whitehaven they have practised several inventions; Mr. Pennant, who visited the mines, speaks of them in this manner: <Q>“The fire-damps, formerly so dangerous, are almost overcome; at present they are prevented by boarded partitions, placed a foot distant from the sides, which causes a free circulatlon of air throughout: but as still there are some places not capable of such conveniences, the colliers who dare not venture with a candle, in spots where fire-damps are supposed to lurk, have invented a curious machine to serve the purpose of lights: it is what they call a steel-mill, consisting of a small wheel and a handle; this they turn with vast rapidity against a flint, and the great quantity of sparks emitted not only serves for a candle, but has been found of such a nature, as not to set fire to the horrid vapour. Formerly the damp or fiery vapour was conveyed through pipes to the open air, and formed a terrible illumination during night, like the irruptions of a volcano; and by its heat water could be boiled: the men who worked in it inhaled inflammable air, and if they breathed against a candle, puffed out a fiery stream; so that I make no doubt, were the experiment made, that the same phenomenon would appear as John ”Grubb attributed to my illustrious countryman, Pendragon, chief of Britons.</Q> Persons skilled in the coal-works in this county, allege that the steel-mill is no security against the inflammable gas, as woeful experience has too frequently proved. Those who have seen the fire-damps circulating in the workings of mines, describe it to be like the curling and undulating of smoke passing along the roof: a particular appearance on the top of the candle, where it gathers, if diligently atten∣ded to, is the most certain criterion by which the approach of that dreadful vapour is discovered. Several explosions by this inflammable vapour have happened in this century, but in the year 1708, the most considerable one of the century. On Tuesday morning, the 17th of August, about three o'clock, a terrible blow was heard, proceeding from the neighbourhood of Chester in the Street, as loud and horrible as if a magazine of gun powder had taken fire, yet of a deader and flatter found; the report was heard remarkably loud, at the distance of six miles. It was soon known that the noise proceeded from an explosion of the coal mines near Lumley; no account of previous circumstances could be obtained, not one person surviving that was at work at the time. It was conjectured, that upon working the coals, some cavity was opened where this magazine of destruction lay, which, getting passage, broke out with dreadful fury at the mouths of the pits. The number of people, which the overmen said were at work, amounted to ninety souls at least; if any survived the blast, they died in the chambers of the mine, for no one durst venture down to relieve them; and no vessel could be let down, the
<PB N="502" REF="578"/>mouths of the pits, or shafts were so shaken and fallen in: about eight or nine bodies were found on the surface, but all of them blown to pieces, some wanting the head, and others the limbs: one carcase was blown so directly from the shaft, which was fifty fathom deep, that it was found at a prodigious distance; how high it might be thrown into the air, not to be calculated. The violence of the shock was such, that several houses at a good distance from the place, were shattered with the force of it, and the gin which wrought with horses, was shattered to pieces, and scattered abroad at a great distance.</P>
<P>The fire-engine is now greatly improved, and not only employed to draw water from the mines, but also to work ventilators, and draw the coals. The depth and various strata of the coal mines, near the Tyne and Wear, are best described by the annexed plates, the accuracy of which may be depended on. Walker colliery on the north of Tyne, is one hundred fathom in dephth, and the seam five feet five inches and a half in thickness.—At Long Benton, the mine called the Bason, is seventy-two fathoms in depth, and the main seam is about seven feet in thickness; the other mine there, called the Delight, is seventy-four feet three inches in depth, and the main seam is seven feet in thickness,—New Benton coalliery is seventy fathom in depth, and the coal seven feet in thickness.—Byker mine is about seventy fathom deep, and the coal five feet ten inches thick: within two feet of the roof, is a band or load of stone, which reduces the coal seam to five feet nine inches.—In an adjoining mine there is a dyke, lying north-west and south-east; many small branches run from it, resembling the root of a tree, in various directions. These coal-seams generally rise to the north-west, and dip to the south-east.</P>
<P>Besides the fulminating vapour, there is another pernicious one in these works, which is arsenical, gross and foul, not suffering the candles to burn, and killing the workmen instantly by its pernicious nature. A person who was suffocated by this vapour, was recovered by being laid on his belly, with his mouth put to a hole cut in the earth; which, it is said, is the usual remedy on such occasions.</P>
<P><Q>“In the grounds at Benwell, about a quarter of a mile north from the river Tyne, a coal mine took fire at a workman's candle, negligently placed, and con∣tinued burning about thirty years, though at first so small, that a proposal was made to put it out, for so low a reward as 2 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> but it was not accepted. It afterwards acquired such force and strength, that it raged with fury, in vari∣ous directions and depths; sometimes taking its course east and west, and at last to the north, into the grounds of <HI>Fenham,</HI> near a mile from its first appearance, committing great ravages in its way, only conspicuous by its flames and columns of smoak in the night. The irruptions at Fenham were in near twenty places. I have not heard that it cast forth stones of any considerable magnitude. Flowers of sulphur, mixed with sal ammoniac, were found concreted on pieces of allum-stone, slate, and the neighbouring furze, of which a physician of New∣castle upon Tyne gave an account to the Royal Society. (Ph. Tr. No. 130) He could discover neither common salt nor nitre in the soil or springs about it, the coal-water being all vitrioline, and tinged red with galls, and other neigh∣bouring fountains being destitute of mineral salts. But he observed, that the coal-ways were mended with a sort of slate, composed of coal, allum-stone, and
<PB N="503" REF="579"/>marcasite, cast in heaps and burnt, from which he often collected both brim∣stone and sal ammoniac. Some of the salt ejected by this bituminous vol∣cano was upwards of six miles broad. It was first observed and gathered by Dr. Gilpin, and, by experiment, proved to be sal ammoniac. In colour, some of it was grey, some snow white, freed from the black <HI>faetor</HI> of the coal, by the ”intense heat of the fire.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wallis.</NOTE></P>
<P>The like circumstances were mentioned to the author, when he visited Whick∣ham, to have taken place in that neighbourhood.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See notes to p. 450. vol. II.</NOTE></P>
<P>The coal mines were singularly preserved from destruction, on two occasions, which are mentioned in Whitlock's Memoirs. In the 19th year of King Charles I. 1643, they were ordered by the Marquis of Newcastle to be fired, when the king's forces were besieged in Newcastle by the Scotch; Lesley, the Scotch General, preserved them by surprising the boats and vessels, that were ordered on that ex∣pedition. In 1648, the Scotch in their turn, under their General Monroe, had projected the like mischief, but receiving intelligence, that the Marquis of Argyle, with a large party of their countrymen, was in arms against them, they fled pre∣cipitately over the Tweed, and with difficulty carried off their baggage and plunder.</P>
<P>The coals are of various colours and figure.—The first to be observed, the miners call <HI>Splint,</HI> hard, glossy, and got in large masses, preferable to all others for strength and duration.—Another with a thick enamel of silvery marcasite.—A third which carries the colours of the rainbow, in a beautiful enamel, much ex∣ceeding what is found in the lead ore, and more permanent, if preserved under a cover, dry and clear of dust. Some has a high natural polish like a mirror; and many specimens break in rhomboidal and parallelapiped figures. Canal-coal is found in small quantities.</P>
<P>Of the various phaenomena in nature, we find some particularly curious in the neighbourhood of Cockfield, communicated by the learned naturalist and mathe∣matician, Mr. George Dixon, whose researches into the bosom of the earth have been great, in his profession of a coalworker. The annexed plans are engraved from drawings by Mr. Dixon; the first of which exhibits a specimen of a break in the strata occasioned by those concussions so scientifically treated of by Mr. John Whitehurst in his <HI>Inquiry into the original State and Formation of the Earth.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Published 1778, London.</NOTE> In the specimen here exhibited, we see a fragment in the form of a wedge, occasioned by that part dropping down from the regular shell; or, by the distended shell be∣ing torn from the wedge, and bulged upwards. Such mighty convulsions, perhaps, first raised the island of Great Britain from the ocean, or severed it from the Gallic shores.</P>

<P>"I have fourteen coal veins, most of them about four feet thick, and some of them eight or nine; they have been in working above one hundred years: but as my coalliers were going on with their work, they were stopped of a sudden by a vein of clay, three feet thick, which cut off all the coal veins oblique∣ly, and threw them eighty fathoms to the northward.</P>

<P>A represents the coal veins, running parallel to one another, and thrown off by a vein of clay from B to C, which is eighty fathoms to the northward. I know something of this has already been observed in the Philosophical Transactions; but nothing so remarkable.—There is another odd turn in the same veins.</P>

The other plate exhibits a dyke, which appears on the
<PB N="505" REF="581"/>surface on Cockfield Fell. Mr. Whitehurst speaking of a species of stone, which he calls Toadstone, and by its description, p. 162, similar to the substance which forms the dyke, says, <Q>It is perfectly similar to Iceland Lava in its appearance and “chemical quality, and that it frequently fills up the fissures in the stratum under∣neath it, more or less, as they are more or less wide: all (the enumerated circum∣stances) plainly evince, that Toadstone was formed by a very different law from the others, and greatly posterior to them; for the beds of limestone must have been formed before they were broken, and broken before their fissures could have been filled up; therefore we may, with much reason, conclude, that toadstone, channel, &amp;c. is actually lava, and flowed from a volcano, whose funnel or shaft did not approach the open air, but disgorged its fiery contents between the strata in all directions. Another remarkable phenomenon accompanying the Derbyshire lava, is, that the stratum of clay, &amp;c. is apparently burnt, as much as an earthen pot or brick, &amp;c. The stratum of clay is about four feet thick, and thus burnt about one foot deep. The circumstances shew, that the posi∣tion of the strata was altered by the convulsion which occasioned the fracture; from whence we may infer, they had originally an uniform arrangement, con∣centric ”to the centre of the earth.</Q> By the reader's referring to the work it∣self, many circumstances will be obtained to explain and elucidate the plan before us. Mr. Dixon's account of the phenomenon is shortly this, <Q>That the dyke “which runs through Cockfield colliery, runs eastward to Buckheads, Bolam, Legs Cross, and so below Yarm, to Aigton in Cleveland; it has not been traced far to the north-west, into the lead-mining country, where, perhaps, it might turn out a good mine, as it is a principal vein. It throws the seams of coal and strata of stone up to the southward, three fathoms; the core or gut of the dyke E D, which is about fifteen or sixteen yards in width, is all hard, blue whin or granite, such as are used for making the turnpike roads. On the rise side of the dyke, from A to B, the coal is turned to a black substance, commonly called dawk or swad, like soot caked together; from B to C the coal is turned into a pretty hard cinder; from thence southward the coal begins to put on its common appearance again. On the dip side of the dyke, from G to F, the coal is turned to dawk or swad; and from F northward the coal begins to appear better by degrees, till it comes to its common course again, but a good deal of it short and tender next the dawky part. Above that part which is cinder, in the roof or stratum next the coal, there is a great deal of sulphur, in angular forms, of a bright yellow colour, and very beautiful.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chemical Essays by Richard Watson, D. D. F. R. S. vol. III.
<P>This may not be an improper place to add a word or two concerning the Derbyshire <HI>Toadstone,</HI> which constitutes one of the principal strata in the mining country, and which is supposed to have been, in its origin, a <HI>slag</HI> thrown out by a volcano. It perfectly resembles some of the specimens I have seen of one of the sorts of lava of Vesuvius, not only in the hardness of its texture, and blackness of its colour, but in its weight; a cubic foot of some forts of Derbyshire Toadstone weighing more, and of the other less than a cubic foot of the Vesuvian lava, which it resembles. Neither the Derbyshire Toadstone, nor that sort of Vesuvian lava which resembles it, seem to have experienced in their formation any great degree of heat, they are but in a half vitrified state; the Toadstone I nave frequently melted in a smith's forge into a black glass, and the Vesuvian lava gives a glass of the same kind. The air has a manisest action on the Derbyshire Toadstone, for it not only wastes away the spar which is found in the blebs of some sorts of Toadstone, but it reduces it into a brownish mould, sit for vegetation, the most hard and compact sorts; the Vesuvian lava is subject to the same change from the same operation of the same cause.</P></NOTE> On each side of the blue stone,
<PB N="506" REF="582"/>betwixt it and the regular strata, there is a thin gut or core, about six inches thick, like clay, which turns water on the rise side of the dyke, and forces it to ”the surface in several springs in the direction of the dyke.</Q> The plan shews that the strata originally lay in a regular arrangement, but that being fractured by some subterranean convulsion, the lava had insinuated itself into the wound, and filled it: that the dyke is formed of lava cannot be doubted, from the soot and cinder which attend it: on trying a specimen of the cinder, it is found to burn clear, without smoke, keeps a durable heat, and affords very little sulphureous effluvia. The dyke appears at the surface of the colour of iron stone, thrown into irregular angles. It may be presumed the rising side of the strata was thrown up by the lava forcing itself into some horizontal channel which it had formed be∣tween the strata; that the strata on the north side sunk when the lava burst forth; but how the stratum of grey stone was formed, must be left to conjecture.</P>
<P>To what has been said of the lead mines, we must add, that the Romans disco∣vered mines of lead in Britain, and after Claudian had carried his victorious arms northward, this country paid tribute in minerals and metals, particularly lead, of which several pieces, or <HI>pigs,</HI> have been found in different parts, with the names of some of the emperors and leaders upon them.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stuk. Caraus. vol. I. p. 176.— Itin. Cutios. p. 173.—Ph. Trans. No. 459.—Camd. Brit. Edit. Opt. p. 679.</NOTE> Pliny tells us, that the mines were so considerable, that by an imperial edict, only a certain quantity was to be worked, "the veins" (in the language of miners) "appearing at the very day," whilst the mines of lead in the Spanish province were few and unproductive.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">In Britannia summo terrae curio adeo largi, ut lex ultra dicatur, ne plus certo modo fiat.—Plin. Nat. Hist. l. xxxiv. ch. 17.</NOTE> Tacitus informs us, that our <HI>Metalla</HI> were the lures of the Roman eagle, and remunerated them for the toils that attended their victories.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cat. of Fossils.— Woodward, p. 2, p. 84.</NOTE></P>
<P>The method or practice of working lead mines is twofold—one by sinking a pit or shaft, and the other by flooding or <HI>hushing,</HI> as it is termed; a large reservoir of water is formed on the eminences, which being let out and discharged by a sluice, the full stream is carried through a cut or opening on the side of the hill, and with an irresistible impetuosity sweeps away the soil and other substances which cover the vein, and carries with it the fragments of ore, and lays open to the miner the ore in the vein. To convey the water from mines, not only engines are used, but <HI>levels, subterraneous passages,</HI> or <HI>drifts,</HI> are carried from the sides of the hills, up to the veins, some of one hundred fathoms in length, and of dimensions large enough for small drays or carriages to pass in them, to bring away the metal. In some of the workings, subterraneous engines are employed.</P>
<P>Silver is extracted from some lead: it has been observed, that one sort of lead which was brought to the port of Newcastle for sale, yielded between thirty and forty ounces of silver per ton.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Wallis, and several others, with specimens.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="507" REF="583"/>
<P>The several strata in the mines in Weardale, are best described by the annexed plan.</P>
<P>The several kinds of lead ore, which the naturalists have noted.—1st, Tessellated lead ore, ponderous and rich, the Tessellae mostly of a parallelopiped figure.— 2d, Globose, multangular, with plain sides, like chrystalline spar, called Diced ore. —3d, Diced ore from a plate of common ore.—4th, Half lead ore, and half chrystalline spar.—5th. Tuberous, with many short arborescent columns, of un∣equal lengths.—6th, Peacocks-tail-ore, from its resemblance, being red, purple, green, blue, and yellow; the yellow native, the blue and green from copper, the red and purple from iron: it is broad grained, fuses badly, and doth not yield a quantity of metal equal to other ores.—7. Snow-white arborescent lead ore, like some of the submarine corallines.—8. Cylindric columns of white lead ore, tubulous, about two inches in diameter.—9. White lead ore, composed of several transpa∣rent tubes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wallis, and several others with specimens.</NOTE></P>
<P>The iron mines at Tanfield are the only workings of that kind in this county. Iron ore has been smelted in various parts anciently, as appears by the heaps of slag left on many of the commons. The iron stone has been gathered, it is pre∣sumed, within a little distance of the surface, or in the water runners and rivulets, and, when wood abounded, the ore was smelted in the nearest places.</P>
<P>There are no copper works in the county.</P>
<P>Of birds, insects, and animals, we have no peculiars, but partake with the neighbouring counties; grouse, partridge, and quails, are common; the rarer kinds of game are not found here; and pheasants and cranes are scarce, even in the liberties of Ravensworth and on the banks of Derwent. We never hear the nightingale in our woods or coppices.</P>
<P><Q>“A small bird is sometimes found on the shores near Hartlepool, that migrates with the woodcock; its weight is not quite a drachm; its wings are mixed with green and grey, the top of its head is cloathed with a shining orange, declining ”to a bright yellow, and ending in a faint green; its tail is long, but not swallow forked.</Q> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Notes from F.

<P>In regard to the medicinal waters in this county, which are at Butterby, we can make little addition to what is said by Mr. Todd in the Philosophical Trans∣actions, and inserted in the notes to the second volume of this work, page 326, save by the following extracts. Dr. Elliot, in his account of the medicinal vir∣tues of our mineral waters,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">London, 1781.</NOTE> speaking of the sulphur water, says shortly, <Q>It is a “strong sulphureous water, and is also impregnated with sea falt. In its virtues, ”it resembles the harrowgate water.</Q>—Dr. Short, vol. I. p. 305. <Q>It contains “hepatic air, some sea salt, and a little earth."—Dr. Monro, vol. I. p. 302,
<PB N="519" REF="595"/>This water springs out of a rock, and has a strong sulphureous smell. Evapo∣rated, Dr. Short got fifty-six grains from a gallon, of which eighteen were earth, ”and thirty-eight salt.</Q></P>
<P>The following curious extract from Dr. Watson's Chemical Essays, may be acceptable in this place, <Q>I have mentioned the <HI>sulphur</HI> well at Harrowgate, “according to its appellation at that place, without taking upon me to decide the long controverted question, concerning the existence of sulphur in that and other waters of the same kind. Sulphur has been long esteemed a mineral body, very common to be met with in waters; and all those waters which have a strong fetid smell, resembling that of a foul gun, have been esteemed to be more or less impregnated with sulphur. However, Dr. Hostman seems to doubt much of its existence, in the greater number of such waters; and Dr. Lucas has affirmed, that it is not to be found in the form of sulphur in any water whatever; not even in that of Aix-la-Chapelle, where a true and perfect sul∣phur is found on the upper parts of the conduits, through which the water passes; for he says, that strictly speaking, these waters do not contain sulphur substantially discovered in them, but are impregnated with a phlogiston, and an acid, the principles of sulphur, which being in a volatile state are sublimed, meet on the surface of the conduits, and there unite in a true and perfect sul∣phur, which did not naturally exist in the water.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Monro on Mineral Waters, vol. I. p. 30, and 196.</NOTE> The author from whom I have made this extract, informs us, that Dr. Rutty maintains the existence of sulphur in mineral waters, and that both Dr. Shaw, and Dr. Short, found sul∣phur in Harrowgate water. Notwithstanding the testimony of such eminent physicians, the more recent opinion of a physician, whom Dr. Monro consulted on the subject, in 1768, is against the existence of sulphur in such waters. "I have taken particular notice of every appearance of the Harrowgate waters, and must own, I never observed any appearance of sulphur floating in them, nor any scum at the top of the well; neither could I meet with any person in that quarter, who remembered the appearance of real sulphur sublimed, upon taking up the stones at the bottom of the well, as mentioned by Dr. Neal." I beg leave to add my own observation on the subject, which I made in 1780.— The water in the well rises into a circular stone bason; a whitish crust adheres to the stone, where it is contiguous to the surface of the water; I scraped off a portion of this crust, and putting it on a hot iron, I found that it burned with the flame and smell of sulphur.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Butterby water is confined to a narrow bason; it has the same appearance; and in the strand where it flows from the well, it leaves a white slimey sediment, of a very sulphureous smell.—W. H.</NOTE> I do not think that this experiment absolutely warrants us to conclude, that actual sulphur is contained in this and other wa∣ters, generally denominated sulphureous; we justly infer from it, that something is sublimed from the water, which either of itself is sulphur, or which in con∣junction ”with the air, or some other principle, constitutes sulphur.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The prosecution of this subject would lead to speculations too abstruse for my design; the following experiment, however, which I have frequently made,
<PB N="520" REF="596"/>will, I hope, throw no inconsiderable light on the cause of the impregnation of ”sulphureous waters in general.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The acid of vitriol does not act upon the common Derbyshire lead ore, ex∣cept when it is assisted by heat, it then dissolves it, and a great escape of air is observed; I made this air, as it was discharged from the ore, pass through a high bended tube into a bottle full of pump water; the water, in a very little time, acquired the fetid smell of Harrowgate water; its taste was the same as that of such sulphureous waters as contain no salt; it was perfectly transparent, but in the course of twenty-four hours it became cloudy, and lost most of its smell; it did not suffer any precipitation, by the addition of the acid of vitriol; silver was blackened, both by being put into this water, and by being exposed to the vapour which arose from it; from all these circumstances, it may pro∣perly ”enough, I think, be called the artificial sulphureous water.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor then proceeds to mention several other minerals that produce the same kind of air, and concludes with observing, that "the air extracted from iron by the acid of sea salt, impregnates with a smell, somewhat resembling that of Harrowgate water."—We will close this article with observing, that when the Butterby sulphureous water was discovered, it was by boring for coals. A coal chiver is found in the stratas adjoining; lead ore also has been found; so that the vitriol and lead ore are proved to be in the vicinity: a dyke, or cast of the rocks, appears to cross the river a little above the salt-spring: this dyke is of the toad∣stone, and shews, in its fissures, that it contains iron; so that salt and iron are also proved to be near to the Butterby sulphureous water.</P>
<P>Of the salt spring, which issues from the fissures of a rock, in the middle of the river Wear, Dr. Elliot only notes, that, "it is drunk as a purging water." Ber∣kenhout, in his Synopsis, does not take notice of it. Mr. Todd speaks of it, as mentioned in our second volume, p. 326. This neglect of so great a curiosity, and so valuable a medicinal water is astonishing. It renders double the quantity of salt, which can be obtained from sea water, and is a strong chalybeate; on drop∣ping a small quantity of tincture of galls into a wine glass full of water, it becomes almost as black as ink,. The estate is now fallen into the hands of mere rustics, and there is little probability that in their time, this valuable gift of nature will be further attended to, than to be the astonishment of the vulgar, who repeat over it the miraculous tale of the monks wandering with the body of St. Cuthbert, and wanting salt to their eggs, (an object of their prayers) found it incrusted on those rocks, by the same sun-shine that roasted their mess.</P>
<P>Of the chalybeate water at Hartlepool, mentioned in this volume, p. 33, we must add, from Dr. Monro, vol. I. p. 381, that, <Q>It is an exceeding sine clear “water, which has a pleasant chalybeate taste, and smells a little of sulphur. As it rises from the fountain, it is lighter than common water, but on standing,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Short, vol. XI. p. 59.</NOTE> Dr. Short says, it looses both its sulphur and chalybeate taste, though it deposits no ochre. Evaporated, Dr. Short got from a gallon, one hundred grains of sediment after the well was inclosed; of which, he says, fifty grains were light
<PB N="521" REF="597"/>calcareous earth. Fifty grains of saline matter containing two parts of a ”calcareous glauber salt, and one part of sea salt.</Q> Berkenhout, who quotes Short, vol. II. p. 59, and Monro, vol. I. p. 380, says, <Q>It contains iron, with a “good deal of Epsom salt and calcareous earth; also some sea salt, and possibly a little sulphur." Dr Elliot says, "It is diuretic and laxative: and is recom∣mended as excellent in scorbutic complaints, in bilious and nervous cholics, in pains of the stomach, and indigestion, in the gravel, in female <HI>complaints,</HI> in the ”hypochondriacal disease, in cachexy, in hectical heats, and in recent ulcers.</Q></P>
<P>Of the chalybeate spring on Elvet moor, near Durham, Dr. Edward Wilon wrote a treatise, under the title of <HI>Spadacrene Dunelmensis,</HI> dated 1675, from which we extract the following curious note, ch. IV. <Q>That it hath a spirit of sulphur “is apparent from the acid taste thereof, for nothing can make this taste in mi∣nerals but spirit of sulphur, neither need we much doubt of sulphur and its vaporous spirit, where we have so much coal; it having both an ironish taste and odour. Being distilled from a bottle thereof, there remained in the bottom a rusty iron-like powder, in quantity about ten grains, which, in taste, had a piercing, sharp, vitrioline pungency, somewhat harsh. By evaporation, I had much less sediment remaining, which makes me more than probably con∣jecture, that it is impregnated, not so much with the corporeal substance, as with the spiritual and subtile particles of the said vitriol; for the water being actuated with the sulphureous acidity, and passing swiftly through some hungry vein of iron, corrodes lightly its more tenuous and aerial parts, resolving them so, as the water imbibes in a manner only the volatile atoms, with which it be∣comes thus saturated; I say, volatile, because, though distilled in a glass still, and luted hermetically, yet are the spirits sooner sublimed than the water, and take wing so swiftly, that before any water comes over, they are unbodied and evaporated, no odour or taste at all remaining in the water; neither will it then become any otherwise tinged with gall than common spring water, though be∣fore distillation, with the mixture of two or three grains of powder of galls, an ordinary glassful becomes as purpureously red, as our genuine and best coloured ”claret.</Q></P>
<P>Before the division and inclosure of Elvet-moor, this spring was handsomely built over with hewn stone, and steps laid for an easy approach to it on each side; but has lately been so far neglected, that it is now scarce to be discovered: this is an age, in which, whatever was venerated by our ancestors, is despised: many modern vices seem to be the issue of that contempt of ancestry.</P>
<P>About two miles above Barnard Castle, sulphur water springs from the crevi∣ces of a rock in the bed of the river Tees, on the Durham side. It can only be come at when the river is low, and from its being often overflowed can seldom be had pure. It is impregnated with the same ingredients as the Harrowgate water. The smell is perceived at some hundred yards distance, and as the water runs over the rocks, it deposits a large quantity of white sediment, and is continually emitting bubbles of hepatic air. Taken as a purgative, and used as a wash, it has been known to cure very obstinate cutaneous eruptions. It is not so much resorted to as formerly, owing to the uncertainty of procuring it free from rain
<PB N="522" REF="598"/>or river water. This spring is situated in a most beautiful and romantic valley, where the winding of the river, its banks finely clothed with woods, and a beautiful view towards Barnard Castle, makes the prospect delightful. If the spring was sought for further from the bed of the river, it might probably be ob∣tained more pure, and would be a valuable acquisition to the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>The premises belong to the Earl of Darlington, and it is hoped that his Lord∣ship will permit the trial to be made. The country is healthy, and not exceeded in natural beauties by any part of the kingdom. With proper conveniences, this would be a happy place of resort for the invalid. A chalybeate water on Bar∣nard Castle moor, is also of great efficacy.</P>
