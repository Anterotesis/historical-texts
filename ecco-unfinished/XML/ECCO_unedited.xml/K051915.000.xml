<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE great service you have done this comedy, by your admirable per∣formance in it, obliges the author to return you his publick thanks; he does so most sincerely; and, at the same time, begs leave to inscribe it to you, as you have certainly the best right to what you have made.</P>
<P>It is not the first time, indeed, that the writer of this piece has been in∣debted to the abilities of Mrs. Abing∣ton: those persons who remember her in the Hypocrite, (and such as have seen that play, I think, cannot have easily forgot her) must allow, that she made a no less striking figure in Charlotte, (the elegant, and sprightly Maria of the Nonjuror) than she now does, in the flaunting, flippant, noisy chambermaid.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
But, while I am endeavouring to acknowledge my obligations to you, let not my complaisance for a lady, make me overlook a friend to whom I am equally bound; I mean Mr. King: who, by all accounts, has supported the character of Muskato in a manner even to force applause from enemies.</P>
<P>I wish I could devise a better me∣thod than I here take to express my gratitude to you both; my praises can add nothing to your reputation, nor to his: however, I shall have a less mean opinion of my writings, than I otherwise would, while they afford either of you an opportunity of inspir∣ing the public, with fresh admiration of your talents.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN this Comedy was put into Mr. Garrick's hands, it was delivered to him as a piece, the chief merit of which consisted in the Intrigue; and, as such, he agreed with the Author, that it was a very great curiosity. It must be owned, indeed, in justice to his discernment, that he thought the exhibition of it a hazardous attempt; however, he at the same time declared, that if the Play did not too far clash with the prejudices of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re∣vailing taste, he thought it had an undou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed right to success. On what ground the writer founded his hopes, that these prejudices would not be unreasonably urged against it; or, if they were, that his Comedy would in the end get the better of them; a short account of the piece from whence he took it, will pro∣bably be the best explanation.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
THE original of the Play, now laid before the public, is called <HI>El Escondido y la Tapada, The Hidden Man and the Veil'd Woman;</HI> and is counted the master-piece of the most famous among the Spanish Dramatic Poets, Don Pedro Calderon de la Barca; who, through Moliere, Corneille, Le Sage, Boissy, &amp;c. has provided Vanbrugh, Centlivre, Cibber, and Steel, with The Mistake, The False Friend, The Wonder, The Busy Body, The Kind Impostor, The Lady's Philosophy, and The Lying Lover, all English Comedies, which have been received upon the stage with the warmest marks of approbation.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, neither these former instances of Calderon's favourable reception among us, nor the forcible manner in which the writer was struck, when he first perused this parti∣cular Comedy of his, were the sole motives that induced him to adopt it. In a little French book, called <HI>Histoire des Fêtes Gallantes des Rois de France,</HI> he found it praised as a miracle of invention and dramatic situations; and that in the year 1668 it was one of the plays that had been performed during the famous feast at Versailles, given by Louis XIV. to his court, and a vast concourse of the first people in Europe. In another book, where it is mentioned, he found that in November 1716 it was again put into French, and acted under the title of <HI>L'Amant Cachè &amp; la Dame Voilée,</HI> first at the castle of the celebrated
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
<HI>Mareschal Noailles,</HI> in honour of his daughter's marriage with Prince Charles; and afterwards by the comedians in Paris, (to whom the Mareschal made it a present) with the greatest success. Lastly, in the year 1769, it was once more translated into the French language, by <HI>Mons. Lanquit,</HI> a Counsellor of Parliament, and an excellent writer and critic; who, after much praise of the poet and the piece, (which he names <HI>La Cloison, The Pannel)</HI> speaking of Don Carlos and Muskato, being locked up in the unfurnished house, he says, <Q>“it is an incident the most theatrical that can be imagined, and nothing is so ineresting and so singular as the situations it produces.”</Q></P>
<P>BUT I shall perhaps be told, that these tes∣timonies in favour of the Original may still leave the Copy without excuse; and as I be∣lieve they who dislike the Play will hardly take my word, when I tell them I have done it no harm, I must refer them to the Spanish original, or the French translation, (which is literal) to enable them to decide the point. I shall only add, in this place, that the critics have long agreed to make a distinction be∣tween Comedies of Character and Comedies of Intrigue; and notwithstanding these are undoubtedly the best, which are composed of a due portion of both, I never understood, from all I have read about the matter, that Comedy forfeited her name by attaching her∣self to either, particularly the latter; in which
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
the great difficulty of the dramatic art seems to lie. Nor can I find, tho' it has been of late years the fashion for Comedy to address herself rather to the Heart and Understanding <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This sort of Comedy, if pleasantry be not intirely excluded, is certainly the most commendable of all; and the Author begs leave to observe, that the Maid of the Mill, a piece written by himself, however trifling in other circumstances, was the first sentimental Drama that had appeared on the English stage for near forty years.</NOTE>, than the Fancy, that she may not address her∣self to the Fancy solely, (as in this piece) without calling her title at all in question.</P>
<P>THESE propositions agreed to, I hope I shall be pardoned for thinking that a reader, or spectator, not violently exceptious, who will sit down with a hearty desire to be amused, may find great entertainment from Calderon's Play. Nay, even the professed critic will meet something not to be displeased with, particularly in the Plot; in which is preserved a perfect unity of action, at the same time that it is branched into a multitude of incidents. These incidents, again, are all naturally prepared; rising one from the other, without confusion, without obscurity; and with less to excuse, on the plea of necessity, (a plea which in some cases a judicious critic will always be ready to admit) than could be easily supposed, in such a tissue of events, drawn from a simple circumstance. Nor, let me say, will a candid judge, who knows how
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
to rate the merit of invention, be very apt to quarrel with such a Play, for a weak Scene, or unguarded Phrase; or for wanting, what in its nature it cannot have, laboured Dialogue, and high wrought Character.</P>
<P>To the performers in this Comedy, the English Author, or Translator, which ever he may be called, has great obligations; particularly to Mr. Reddish, who, in the character of Don Carlos, accepted of a part, purely to serve him, greatly below his merit; though his spirited action gives it consequence in the representation. To Mr. Parsons, Mr. Brereton, and Mr. Baddely, he is also very much obliged.</P>
<P>To Mr. Garrick he is indebted for—every thing; but, as they were given in a moment of necessity and disappointment, he must par∣ticularly thank him for his Prologue and Epilogue; the value of the gift being in no sort lessened to the receiver, by the short time taken to produce them.</P>

<L>With silent respect, will a thing or two say</L>
<L>About my relation who wrote this new play:</L>
<L>My cousin, poor soul's, in a damnable fright,</L>
<L>Becase why?—to amuse ye he takes great delight;</L>
<L>I said, fye, for shame!—what a man and be frightful?</L>
<L>A pale bashful Irishman's never delightful;</L>
<L>No conquests are gain'd, with such dread looks as those;</L>
<L>I told him, a man should not shrink at his foes;</L>
<L>That you were his friends, and would taste what he writ,</L>
<L>If he would not o'erload you with humour and wit;</L>
<L>He swore he would <HI>not</HI> be so wake and absurd;</L>
<L>And if I know my cousin, he'll not brake his word.</L>
<L>My cousin's no fool, at your reading and writing,</L>
<L>Tho' now for his play, he's as pale as a whiting.</L>
<L>I answer'd for <HI>you,</HI> which his heart has much eas'd,</L>
<L>That tho' you don't like it, I'm sure you'll be plas'd;</L>
<L>For they say that Old Nick, if he's plas'd, will be civil;</L>
<L>You'll like it, if not plas'd, to be unlike the Devil.</L>
<L>In short, my dear cousin has taken a prize;</L>
<L>I'm sure you'll applaud him, 'tis <HI>Spanish,</HI> my boys.</L>

<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would insinuate, I suppose—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh nothing farther, Sir, than that you have the precedence in that, as you ought in all other things in which we are mutually concerned; you are mad, <HI>en maitre,</HI> as the French have it: I am mad, through complaisance, as it were; or interest; or to adapt myself to the company of my betters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how do you prove this, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk</SPEAKER>
<P>How do I prove it?—Thus—It is scarcely three months since we were obliged to make our escape from this good town of Madrid, after having killed a gentleman, brother to a certain lady, to whom, for some months before, you had been paying your addresses: and what is not a little ex∣traordinary, you were not only the professed ad∣mirer of his sister, but his rival at the same time with another lady, about whom you wisely took it into your heads to quarrel Well, after having fought ourselves out of Spain, we arrived safely and happily in Portugal; when, I know not upon what crotchet—for you never told me a word of your intention, till the moment you put it in practice—coming one evening suddenly into your lodgings—Maskato, says you—Here, your honour, says I—Get our boots, says you, and saddle the mules di∣rectly—I thought we were going to take the air in some of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pretty outlets about town—but the devil a bit—No sooner had we set foot on the road to Spain, than clapping your heels smartly to the sides of your beast, off you went in a hand gallop, and I followed—crick, crack—whip and spur, through t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick and thin—till here we are at the gates of Madrid again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you are surprized that I should think you a madman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not unacquainted, Muskato, with the vio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of my passion for Marcella, the daughter of Don Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man de Ribbera—I loved her
<PB N="3" REF="15"/>
from the first moment I saw her; but finding her prepossession in favour of a relation of her own, an unsurmountable bar to my wishes, I at length de∣termined to get the better of an inclination so un∣happily placed, and to that end cast my eyes upon another very beautiful woman, whom you are also acquainted with—Aurora, the sister of Don Pedro Paccheco.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, and being so mighty well ac∣quainted with all these things—as, to my sorrow, I most certainly am—but what signifies your going about to tell me this rigmiroll story now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a melancholy indulgence in discoursing upon the subjects of our uneasiness—I say then, my friend, I used every means possible to make myself really fall in love with Aurora; but my heart refused to be an accomplice in the inconstancy to which my reason advised me—for my misfortune, Don Alonzo, the brother of the beauty from whose power I endeavoured to free myself, was the pro∣fessed admirer of her whom I affected to serve—I one day saw them walking together on the Prado; I was willing to interrupt the tête à tête, and im∣mediately joined them—Aurora appeared pleased with my company; and after I came up, paid little attention to Don Alonzo—this piqued his pride—he took occasion to insult me—we drew our swords—I had the advantage—and, at the second pass, my antagonist lay dead at my feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>At mine, upon my honour, Sir, for there he fell—and a well timber'd fellow he was—I think I never saw a finer corps since I came into the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>This unlucky affair forced me to fly—and when I had been about two months in Por∣tugal, I received this letter from Aurora—<STAGE>(taking a letter from his pocket)</STAGE>—you may read it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know I can't, and that's the reason you are so willing to let me—however, read it for
<PB N="4" REF="16"/>
me; I have done more than that for you before now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Listen then—After some general ex∣planations of complement and regard, are these words, <Q>“You know my brother is absent, and you cannot have a surer retreat than in my house, where the family will never think of searching for you: accept it I beseech you: you will be on the spot to manage your affairs; and I am persuaded nothing prevents your pardon, but your not being here to excite your friends to a proper zeal.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, Sir, to convince Donna Aurora that you were not insensible of her obliging offer, you quitted Lisbon, where you were in peace and safety—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>In effect, Muskato, friends are seldom so sollicitous for us in our absence—I have therefore come to Madrid upon this invitation. In the day∣time I can conceal myself in Aurora's house; and at night, go out among some I dare trust, whose in∣terest, if warmly exerted, may be of the utmost service to me. And shall I confess, that I am not a little flattered with the thought, now I am here, of sometimes accidentally seeing the charming Marcella; and now and then, in an evening paying my homage under her window?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to be sure, Sir, that must be a comfort to a gentleman of your amorous disposition; and to speak the truth, I promise myself some little grati∣fication, in enjoyments of the same kind; for what between Beatrice, chamber-maid to Donna Mar∣cella, and Leonarda, the governante of Donna Aurora.—But I am sadly afraid we shall be executed before we have time to put any of those pretty fancies into practice.</P>

<P>I hope, Sir, you have had no reason to repent—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray hear me out. This confidence in your discretion naturally led me to expect that you would keep a more than ordinary guard upon all your actions; on the contrary, however, I had re∣peated advice from hence, that the honour of our family was in imminent danger from your want of prudence; a friend in particular, writ me word, that, in the month of April last, you left your lodg∣ings, with Don Alonzo de Ribbera; and that while you were walking together on the Prado, another cavalier came up, charged him sword in hand, and killed him on the spot. In a word, it is this intel∣ligence that has brought me here to Madrid. It is a duty I owe both to you, and myself, to find out the truth of these reports; and, if they prove au∣thentic, it will be my duty, to take such measures, as may prevent your running into the like disorders for the future.</P>

<P>It seems then, you give credit to the scan∣dalous fable, upon the scent of which you have run so far.</P>

<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall deal plainly with you. I have been this day, in every place, where I thought it possible to have my doubts satisfied by enquiry; particularly at Don Guzman's, whose unfortunate son perished in the rencounter with Don Carlos de Pimentel. But, upon the whole, I know not whether absolutely to believe, or totally to discredit it. I find, both the young men, were known for your admirers; and the report certainly ran, that you were the lady present at their fatal dispute; how∣ever, being veiled, in the confusion that ensued upon Don Alonzo's falling, the woman, whoever she was, escaped without being positively known.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, Sir, I give you my word, and I expect you will rely upon it, that, whatever wicked, and idle stories might be propagated, I was not the lady present, when the two cavaliers you mention fought. What! can you suppose that I would go to walk on the Prado without an attendant; that I would suffer gentlemen to follow me there; and, above all, that I would be the occasion of a duel?

<P>You came to-day to my uncle's, to ask about the melancholy affair, in which my cousin, Don Alonzo, was killed by Don Carlos de Pimentel; I then told you all I knew of the matter, and that the assassin had escaped to Portugal.</P>

<P>How do you know?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>About an hour ago, my cousin Marcella and her maid, were overturned in a coach, just by my uncle's house; going out to their assistance, we met two men, who endeavoured to shun us; coming back, we crossed them again; and, by the light of the flambeaux, which fell directly on their faces, I saw and knew one of them to be Don Carlos. I immediately gave a servant the word, and he has dogged him, and his man, to a little inn, where they put up two mules, they had with them; and on which, they appeared to be just come off a journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are positive you saw Don Carlos?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am as positive it was he, as that I this moment see you.—Now, as I am shortly to be married to my cousin, it is highly incumbent upon me to render myself acceptable to my uncle; and, I am certain, I can do nothing more likely to please him, than taking vengeance on the man who kill'd his son. I therefore expect that you will lend me

your assistance upon so interesting an occasion, and accompany me to the place where the servant is ready to lead us: either to see that I have no foul play done me in an assault; or to help me to seize the delinquent, and give him over to the officers of justice.</P>

When I had thoughts of bringing you back to Madrid, it occurred to me, that the partition on my side might again be secretly opened, and prepared in such a manner, as would effectually screen you from any search, should it ever be suspected that you were in the house: ac∣cordingly, the thing is done, <STAGE>(going to the back scene, she lifts up a pannel, which discovers the head of a stair-case)</STAGE> and this moveable pannel, will, when you please, admit you into a place of security; and, when fastened on the inside—</P>

<P>Excuse me, Ma'am, I have too grateful a sense of your kindness, to avail myself of a retreat, which must expose you. In this emergency, the most simple way is to return to the place from whence I came.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's my advice, Sir; let us go to the

<P>Oh, hold! Don Carlos, you must not go to the inn, unless you have a mind to run into the jaws of inevitable destruction.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have, by some accident or other, been seen, since you came to Madrid, by young Fer∣dinand, the nephew of Don Guzman de Ribbera. His servant dogg'd you to your inn; and he, and my brother, are just gone in search of you.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the lady says, Sir, is just and reason∣able—I have considered the matter; and, if you don't do it, I'll give myself up to justice imme∣diately, and try to be admitted king's evidence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand, Don Pedro, you have had a scuffle in the street; you are known; and the person you have wounded, is the Duke of Medina Sidonia himself; who was going, incog. to the lodgings of a courtezan, in the quarter where you assaulted him.</P>

<P>Fatal accident!—the Duke himself!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="36"/>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a neighbour, and friend to your family, I am come to advise you to abscond without delay. The Duke's relations are proud and vindictive; and should he die, the worst consequences are to be ap∣prehended. In my opinion, indeed, you ought to take every thing belonging to you out of these apartments directly; for, depend upon it, as soon as an order can be procured from court, the officers of the police will be here; and, find who or what they will, they'll seize all without mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you stand like one confounded? Do you not hear what Signor Octavio says? You and your family must be gone from hence; I will stay behind, and see your goods removed with all possible diligence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is most valuable, may be put into my warehouse, in half an hour: and if Don Pedro will commit the key of his apartments to my charge, I will do my utmost to quash whatever enquiries may be made after him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get a coach to the door, and call hither my sister and her maid; I must dispose of them in safety, the first thing I do.—My dear friend, had not you cried out, "That is the man," when you saw the person musfled coming towards us, I should not have drawn my sword upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fault was entirely the Duke's: had he discovered, instead of preparing to defend, him∣self, when he was called on to surrender, we should have acknowledged our error, and desired his pardon.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Aurora</HI> and <HI>Leonarda; Octavio,</HI> at the same time, going out, and afterwards returning with ser∣vants, to whom he appears to give directions about unfurnishing the house.</STAGE>

<P>What are your commands, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you, wretched creature, that you were born for my destruction, as well as my disho∣nour:

had not your misconduct brought me to Madrid, I might have escaped what has this night happened?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what has happened?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don Ferdinand came hither just now; to desire I would accompany him on an affair of ho∣nour, but we have missed the person we went in search of, and by mistake assaulted another, who proves to be the duke of Medina Sidonia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, and what—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must withdraw immediately to a place of safety; think not however, I will leave you any more at your own disposal, to add infamy to my misfortunes; a coach is already sent for, and late as it is, before we part, I will see you and your maid safely lodged with our cousin Matilda, abbess of the Ursuline nunnery.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I'm sure I'll not go into a nunnery.</P>

if we have not been in this rat-hole thirteen hours, by any measurer of time in Castile, I'll be content to be carried from hence to Mexico, stowed in a beer barrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, Aurora has forgot us; and yet that's impossible too: let us advance a little; gently, every thing's very quiet, Muskato; they are cer∣tainly asleep still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>May be so, Sir; I can only say they are slugabeds then; and that they lie longer in a morn∣ing, than people who regard their health ought to do.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>What extravagancies are you uttering?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or, perhaps, a gang of house-breakers

broke in: they understood their business to a nicety, upon my word; for they seem not to have left so much as a joint-stool behind them.</P>

<P>Come from thence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, do you rather come here, and judge for yourself. If ever I saw a room cleaner picked to the walls, I wish I may be shot. From the silence too, one should imagine the family lie murder'd in their beds; in which case we have had a lucky escape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a remarkable disturbance in the house, soon after we were shut up, that we both took notice of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Knocking and hammering, I remember it, Sir; and it was then, I suppose, that they were making conveyance of the goods and chattles.</P>

<P>Hold, Sir, I find a certain boldness, or cou∣rage, come upon me; it may be owing to hunger; but no matter: I will venture forth to explore the contiguous apartments, and make you acquainted with my discoveries. I hope, at least, they have left us a little bread and water.</P>

<P>I feel a sudden alarm and terror, which I am un∣able to account for. This room has certainly been unfurnish'd during the night; and for what purpose? Something more than ordinary it must be owing to; and, perhaps, the design may be treason against me; yet, how against me? How is it possible? But there's no time for reflection; at any rate it will be impolitic in me to remain in a place, under such suspicious circumstances. Muskato!

<P>How, through the key-holes? The doors are all double locked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>They have bars, on the outside, as thick as mill-posts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there nobody in the house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a creature, except ourselves; nor a cranny left for a fly to get out at. I have been all through the rooms; and every thing's gone that they could conveniently carry off: in the kitchen, however; I found a few dry crusts; here they are; 'tis true I might conceal them for my own eating; but, friends in affliction should be generous to one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I am in amaze!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you have a bit, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, was a man to rack his ima∣gination, in order to conceive a more singular ad∣venture, it would be hardly possible to do it. Au∣rora invites me hither, secure in the absence of her brother; he unexpectedly arrives a day before me; she shuts me up in a closet, against my will, to hide me from him; and, in a few hours that I am in the house, it is totally turned upside down; and I am left alone in it, without so much as a passage by which I can make my escape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>"Well, be sure to come to you early in in the morning; and, in the mean time, for your lives don't come out upon any account whatever." <STAGE>(dashing his hat upon the ground)</STAGE> Oh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>What fury possesses you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>These, Sir, as I take it, you may remem∣ber to have been the words that issued, last night, from the sweet lips of our good natured friends,
<PB N="26" REF="42"/>
and benefactresses, when they were shoving us into the hole there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well what would you infer from thence? You don't suspect Aurora of perfidy; consider what joy she testify'd upon seeing us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Sir, her snare was not laid for nothing; and she was glad to have us fall into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, was ever consternation more strongly painted than hers, when she thought. I should meet her brother, who was gone out in pur∣suit of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>All a lye; she saw we were likely to escape, and trumpt up that story to make sure of us; but pray, Sir, look round, and give me leave to ask you one simple question; for what reason do you think Don Pedro, or s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mebody else, has unfurnished this house so suddenly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, to me, it is as clear as the sun at noon-day: having you in their power, and being determined to sacrifice you, they mov'd off the goods beforehand, that they might not be exposed to confiscation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad formerly a master-key to this house; but, when I was going to Portugal, I gave it back to Aurora: little did I think I should ever come to stand in such need of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but, Sir, a truce with complaining, and let us consider what's to be done; for, as I take it, active measures will be necessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see but one means for our delivery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Give me a glympse of it, for I am so thick sighted of myself that I can discover never a one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>The apartment below is occupied by a merchant; I will discover myself to him: it is better to run the risk of that confidence than to stay here to be assassinated.</P>

<P>And how shall we contrive to make this merchant acquainted with our distress?</P>

<P>Well but, stay, Sir, don't go about things hand over head; what if, at the first stroke, this merchant, and his people, should take us for thieves, break in upon us at once, and knock us on the head? Or, take it another way, suppose they should call the constables, before we have an opportunity to explain ourselves? In our present situation, I ap∣prehend we should not be better off.</P>

<P>In Italy you mean, Don Guzman.</P>

<P>In Italy, so he has; I thought he had been among the Turks; but it's the same thing. Here's a couple of doubloons for you, Mr. Algua∣zil: give him two doubloons Octavio. I am sorry to see officers of justice, who should be characters

<P>I find then, Sir, your nephew has—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you are going to say; yes, my nephew has told me all, but not a word to any one else in our house; if my daughter was to hear it, she would fall into fits, she was so fond of her brother, and is so fond of her cousin: besides, being of a tender and delicate disposition, which she in∣herits from her mother—</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, I'm afraid so, I'm afraid so, in∣deed, my dear friend: but don't talk to me of that, because it makes me melancholy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have received a letter this morning, from Don Pedro, to desire I would endeavour to lett these apartments: I don't know how to proceed, but I fancy the best way will be, to put a bill upon the outside door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I am come to talk to you about that; my nephew has received a letter from him too. I suppose you would give this tenement a bargain, to any one, that would take it off your hands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Sir, on an occasion like this—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would be glad to take any thing
<PB N="31" REF="47"/>
you could get; isn't that what you were going to say? Why, you're in the right; and I should be sorry, Don Pedro, who is a neighbour's child, re∣ceived any injury by his civility to us: so, if twenty dollars a month will be a sufficient rent, I will e'en hire the premisses for my own use, and take posses∣sion directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, Sir, twenty dollars are too little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but consider, it's doing the young man a favour, and I put myself to some inconve∣nience: besides, I won't give a half-penny more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, it is needless to dispute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>How many rooms are there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you see them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it is not the first time I have been here; besides, I settled with my nephew how the thing was to be, before I came out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, Sir, you intend entering to day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You think belike, seeing my family in the house, would prevent further enquiries, and satisfy the Police, that Don Pedro—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>I really think, Sir, that, as your chief motive for taking the apartment, is to serve Don Pedro, the sooner you and your family come into it, the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of that opinion too, and as very luckily my time is just up where I now lodge, and I want some larger rooms, in consequence of my daughter's marriage, which I shall shortly celebrate; I am this moment preparing to move the furniture from one place to the other, and shall send to you for the key, within this half hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will oblige me, Don Guzman, by charging yourself with the key now; for having a small vineyard near town, I have shut up my place below, and sent all my servants, men and women, to work there.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>

<SP>

<P>Yes, Sir, but he does not know you are in his hands; and by some fortunate means or other, you may, perhaps, contrive to slip thro' his fingers.</P>

<P>To compleat my misfortune to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the merchant below is gone out, with his family, and has shut up his doors; so that my retreat is stopped that way.</P>

<SP>

<P>Like them, not at all; I never saw such a battered barrack in my days; who could build the dog-hole? In the first place, that door has not common sense in it; then the stairs are the wrong way, and so steep, and narrow, that they are like a ladder to get into a cock loft: and the windows! mercy on us, what pidgeon holes; and a mile and a half from the ground.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say then, Beatrice, my cousin, Don Fer∣dinand,
<PB N="37" REF="53"/>
no doubt, imagines that marriage is a dis∣pensation from the subaltern duties, exacted by com∣plaisance, since he already begins to fail in those marks of tenderness and regard, I expected to find from him—he forgets that love is nourished by at∣tention; and, that the slightest negligence, kills it—Yesterday evening I went to the Prado—Don Fer∣dinand stayed behind—I was in danger of my life—Don Ferdinand, indeed, came to my assistance; but not till I had been previously rescued by another—I got home terrified and disordered—Don Ferdinand immediately went out, and left me—I am willing to excuse this behaviour; but, at the same time, I can∣not help saying to myself, how will he treat me when I am his wife, if he uses me thus, while he calls me his mistress?</P>

<P>Ah, dear Marcella, did you know how uneasy you make me by this kind of discourse—</P>

<P>And why uneasy?—I did not address my∣self to you—what I spoke, was said to Beatrice—and you need take no notice of it, as you need not be supposed to overhear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right, Ma'am—and to let you know another thing, Sir, you are not to take the words out of my mouth—my lady spoke to me; and it's my part to answer—and here's the way I do it—I suppose, Ma'am, Don Ferdinand is like the rest of his sex; who, for the most part, follow women as they hunt hares and foxes: when the animal's catched, the sport is over.—I once had a sweetheart myself, Ma'am, that used to call me his queen, and his goddess; and, one day, he wanted to kill him∣self for me; but, when he found I was willing to let him, he soon convinced me, he was not in earnest. I remember, he used to compare my eyes to dia∣monds; and my lips to rubies; and my teeth to pearl; and my neck to alabaster: and he used to say, his heart was set a▪fire; and that the steel of my
<PB N="38" REF="54"/>
beauty, had struck against the flint of his inclination; and a great deal of stuff, in that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stuff, indeed, Beatrice!—But your lady will do me the justice to confess, that from the first moment she vouchsafed to listen to my pretensions, I never gave into those ridiculous hyperboles, which accompany the declarations of ordinary lovers: such can only be of use to charm vulgar minds. The only eloquence to persuade a mind, formed like my Marcella's, is sincerity; and, I always thought, the best way to acquire her esteem, was to convince her that she possessed mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, will you be so good as to repeat that over again; if it is not the prettiest thing I ever heard in my life; I believe you took it from some novel though.—Come, Ma'am, give him your hand to kiss, and tell him you are friends with him.—Look you there, Sir, I knew it—There's nothing does with us, like a little talk.</P>

<P>HOW painful is a state of suspence! and what a night, and day, have I passed!—When I reflect on the situation in which I left Don Carlos, I am half distracted—Suppose he has endeavoured to make his escape; and, in the attempt, fallen into the hands of justice: or, suppose he still remains shut up in the house?—Will he not, in either case, condemn me, as the contriver of his misfortune?—I have prevailed upon the portress of this convent, where my brother has confined me, to let Leonarda out; she has taken with her a master-key, which was providentially in the trunk sent hither with my cloaths—If Carlos is yet in the house, she will give him that, and he may release himself as soon as it is night—If he is already gone, I shall, at least, be so far satisfied, as to know it—And, probably, if he has been seized—</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Ma'am, as soon as you gave me the key, and I got out of the convent here, I made the best of my way to our street, considering with my∣self how I cou'd come to the door of the house, and open it, if possible, without being observed by the people of Octavio, the wine-merchant; for you know, Ma'am, the more secret I did the thing, the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No doubt on't. Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and so, Ma'am, going along, as I tell you, at the turning of the lane, before you come to the Jacobine's Church, who should I meet, but Signor Octavio himself, mounted upon his mule, just going out of town: you may be sure, we stopp'd to speak to one another; and he asked me, if you had seen your brother: No, Sir, says I, not since last night. Well, says he, give my service to your lady, and tell her, she may be quite easy about him, for Don Guzman has taken your house—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you don't know whether Don Car∣los has made his escape, or not? or what is become of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leon.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shou'd I, Ma'am, unless I was a witch!—But, I take it for granted, he's in the house still, unless he has made his escape, without any one's discovering him:—for to be sure, Ma'am, if Signor Octavio had known any thing about him, he wou'd have mentioned it; and I put him a great many leading questions.</P>

<P>I have been at the Duke of Medina's; and I find his wounds are not so bad as I at first apprehended; though he is still in danger. The report, however, of Don Pedro being the person who assaulted him, rather gains ground; and I hear the police is still making strict enquiry after him.</P>

<P>Like enough.</P>

<P>It must not be, foolish; I tell you, I know her constitution; it might bring her to a sick-bed, and prevent your being married to her these three months; besides, is there any thing more common than to have centinels at the door, upon occasion of publick weddings? <STAGE>(To a servant, who appears)</STAGE> Well, have you fitted up the next rooms for my nephew, as I order'd you?</P>

<HEAD>ACT IV. SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Chamber in <HI>Don Guzman's</HI> house: <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> enters with a letter, followed by <HI>Lazarillo.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND pray, Sir, who gave you this letter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, nobody gave it to me; that is to say, what you can properly call gave; but just now while you were abroad, and I was brushing your cloaths yonder in the gallery, Mrs. Beatrice bolted out of her lady's chamber; there, says she, there's a letter for your sweet master; 'tis from Donna Marcella, give it him: and with that, Sir, throwing to me, or rather flinging at me, the paper you now hold in your hand, she turn'd upon her heel, and shut the door with a clap, that made the house shake again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me read it once more, that I may be sure I clearly understand her meaning. <Q>“Tho' I am satisfied there are some instances of ill behaviour in your sex, which the delicacy of ours hardly permits us to take notice of; I cannot help telling you, that your bringing an ill woman into my father's house last night, is a proceeding of that monstrous nature, as is neither to be defended, or forgiven. What, while you was under a contract of marriage with his daughter; when the most sacred promise of lasting fidelity! was ready to part from your lips: but I will not animadvert on an action, I cannot think of without horror; I shall only inform you, that there is an end of any farther connection between you and me.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so she concludes, your humble servant Marcella de Ribbera?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever hear the like of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, I can't charge my memory exactly; but for the meaning of the letter, I think it pretty plain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="64" REF="80"/>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>D'ye?—Now to me it is utterly inexpli∣cable: was there a woman in the house last night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, the servants say so:—I suppose after Donna Marcella—and from the reports of Mrs. Beatrice—for my own part, I neither saw man nor woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>A man there was, by all that's sacred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir, I don't pretend to contradict you; but how did he contrive to slip away from us then? The centinels were posted at the door before you came in; and as the family was awake, and stirring about, I think it hardly possible for him to have got from the chambers to the street, without meeting some one or other of us in his passage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>The possibility of the thing is clear, by it's having happened. No doubt, a lucky moment favoured his escape; and though the centinels say nobody passed, he might, before they were ap∣prized, have gone out unnoticed by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that's true too, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, at any rate, Lazarillo, I am by no means sorry this affair has happened; on the con∣trary, it lets me into some circumstances relative to Donna Marcella's turn of mind, which it is my in∣terest to be acquainted w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th; and I am glad to come to a knowledge of them before it is too late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, and so you ought. Ah! Sir, it is not always your faces full of smiles, and dimples, that cover the kindest hearts, or the best natures; and between ourselves, I have long suspected, that Donna Marcella conceal'd more under hers, than she chose to let appear for the present. A tyger's a tyger, Sir, for all it's pretty spotted skin; and the likeness between the beast, and the Christian, lies in this: as in the animal, a fair outside is the wrapper, or surtout, to a damn'd, growling, fierce disposition; so a lady, though she has a face like an angel, may have a temper worse than a devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where's my uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="65" REF="81"/>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gone after his lawyers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I had seen him before he went out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>He'll be in again presently, I dare say.—But I don't believe he knows any thing of this bustle; for Donna Marcella was retired to her chamber last night, before he returned from the governor's: and I am sure they have not seen one another this morn∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have been glad of an opportunity to talk to him, for all that; for I might have told him, first—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there, to be sure, Sir, you wou'd have had an advantage: and after all, if there is to be an accusation trump'd up on either side, have not you as good a right to question Donna Marcella about the man, as she has to call you to an account about the woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I have, every bit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>For as we say, Sir, what's law for the clerk, is law for the curate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, for my part, I look upon all this to be a fetch; a stroke of female artifice; in order to bring about some scheme or other, which I have hi∣therto been unable to discover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more likely, Sir; and, in that case, depend upon it, Madam Beatrice is the person who has put every thing into her head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't doubt it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, she is a fiend incarnate! the very serpent, in woman's flesh! and if I was you, Sir, the first article I stipulated, before I married Donna Marcella, shou'd be, that she turn'd that Jezabel out of her service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will stipulate it; and insist upon it too.—But I can tell you, Lazarillo, I am now in very great doubt, whether I shall marry or not; for there is something in this letter, that tries my temper to such a degree—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="66" REF="82"/>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>No wonder, Sir; any gentleman's temper wou'd be tried by it:—and, to speak my opinion, if I was in your place, I wou'd no more tye myself—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>At least, I will behave with a proper spirit upon the occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay that I wou'd do, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am determined on it.—I suppose she is in her chamber there—I'll go into her, and desire an explanation of her behaviour.</P>

<P>We must get him out, Ma'am, while your father and Don Ferdinand are abroad; it will be better than calling the servants to take him, for reasons—</P>

<P>But how shall we get him out?—He is sub∣ject to be seen by all the servants in the house, every one of whom know him;—and, at last, perhaps, he may be stopp'd by the centinels at the door.</P>

<P>The centinels!—I never thought of them.—Lord!

<HEAD>ACT V. SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>A street; with a view, near the bottom of the stage, of <HI>Don Guzman</HI>'s house, with two centinels at the door.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Don Ferdinand <HI>enters with</HI> Don Pedro.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>THE Duke of Medina, then, is entirely out of danger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>His physicians pronounced him so this morning. I told you, that the colonel of the regi∣ment, to which I belong, was now at Madrid; I knew him to be a man of honour, and was sure of his friendship. I writ him a candid account of my rencounter with the Duke, to whom he immediately went; and he managed matters so well, that just now he came to the place of my retreat with the message I have repeated to you: that his Grace took the blame of the whole affair upon himself, and assured me, upon his honour, he would not suffer me in any way to be troubled or molested about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>It speaks the generosity which always ought to distinguish the nobleman. You may be∣lieve, being in a great measure the instrument of your misfortune, I more than participated in the un∣easiness it gave you. But I hope the remainder of your stay at Madrid will not be less agreeable, for the unlucky accident which threatened to cloud it, so soon after your arrival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was my peace, and honour, entirely in my own keeping, I flatter myself neither one, nor the other, would be often in danger: but what shall I say to you, Don Ferdinand?—Last night, my sister, whom I had placed in a neigh∣bouring convent, taking advantage of the indis∣position of the abbess, and the retirement of the
<PB N="84" REF="100"/>
rest of the community, imposed upon a silly old nun, injudiciously trusted with the keys of the house; she let her go out, as she says, but for an hour; and from that time, to this, she has never been heard of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let her out! Upon what pretence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot clearly learn. Her maid, who is left behind, says her mistress did not intrust her with the secret: the nun has been interrogated again, and again; but she is so old, her memory is so feeble, and she gives such a confused account, that it is impossible to form any conjectures upon what she says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can you form no conjectures your∣self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it is a suspicion I am unwilling to divulge; but to tell you the truth, from your hav∣ing seen Don Carlos de Pimentel the other evening, I have no manner of doubt, that she is either hid with him some where in Madrid, or that she is fled with him from hence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is extraordinary, very extraordinary, indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, Don Ferdinand, you yourself seem to be in a state of mind, to-day, far from perfectly tranquil; what is the matter with you? I hope my vexations are not contagious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but to be sincere with you, a little disturbance has happened this morning at home, which puts me somewhat out of sorts: I am angry with others, and angry with myself; but as there are faults on both sides, I hope all will be put again in the right channel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope so too; for, believe me, nothing could augment my own sufferings more, than a knowledge of your having any thing to make you materially uneasy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="85" REF="101"/>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Don Pedro, stand back a litt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; do you see the fellow that creeps yonder under the wall, looking behind him every moment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, what of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>He comes this way. I have my reasons for it; let us stand a little under that piazza, and observe him.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Muskato.</STAGE>
<P>What an infernal thing is a life of apprehension! I wish I may never stir, if my fear has not almost melted me into a jelly: <HI>(clapping his hands behind him, between his waistcoat and coat.)</HI> Ay, ay; thro' shirt, waistcoat, and all; I could not be in a finer perspiration, if the whole college of physicians had been endeavouring to bring me to it. Well, how it will end, Heaven knows; I am out of the house, that's one comfort; and in some measure the way is paved for my master; for I have been among his friends, and six of them, brave, sturdy, young fellows, armed with swords and pistols, will be ready to favour his escape; the hour they are determined on is the most convenient that can be, when our Dons are taking their digestive naps after dinner. I only wait their arrival, to give Don Carlos the signal from this little popper; <HI>(shews a pocket pistol)</HI> but I must first take a view of the house, which I may do with safety, from yonder corner, in order to determine on which side I had best stand, when I give the alarm, that it may be sure to come to my master's ears. <HI>(going off, with his face towards the audience, suddenly starts, and turns.)</HI> Who do you want? It is not I! Lord have mercy upon me, I thought some one had touched my shoulder. I'll shoot the first man that assaults me.</P>
<STAGE><PB N="86" REF="102"/>
Don Ferdinand, Don Pedro, <HI>and then</HI> Lazarillo.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis he, I'm positive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold a little. <STAGE>(ringing at <HI>Don Guzman</HI>'s door, <HI>Lazarillo</HI> comes out.)</STAGE> Come this way, you Sir; do you see the man that goes along yonder, with his hat flapped over his face? Pass by him, and try if you know who he is. <STAGE><HI>(Lazarillo</HI> goes out.)</STAGE> The fellow's not at home, whom I sent to dog Don Carlos, the night before last, or he could tell di∣rectly whether this is the same person that was with him.</P>

<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your man has taken a thorough survey of his whole person.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let us go, and seize him directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Don Ferdinand, you and your servant will be sufficient to deal with him, and it is absolutely necessary for me, to pay the compli∣ment of calling at the duke of Medina's imme∣diately; however, I'll be with you at your house in less than half an hour.</P>

<SP>

<P>Yes, Sir; because I wou'd be as precise in answering your question, as possible: and, if it is now about half an hour after one, as I partly con∣jecture, Don Carlos is at this moment, picking his teeth, after dinner, in the city of Lisbon.</P>

<P>There is really nothing in this house, from morning till night, but noise and confusion.—What is the matter here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only a couple of alguazils, Madam, as you may perceive by their dress, that have got a poor criminal in their clutches, and are going to play the devil with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the servant of Don Carlos de Pi∣mentel; I catched him just now in the street, mea∣suring the outside of our house, with his eyes, from top to bottom.—I know his master is at present in Madrid; and I suspect, this emissary of his was not lurking about this neighbourhood for any good pur∣pose:—rather, perhaps, in meditation of some far∣ther destruction of our family;—for, searching his pockets, we found a pistol.</P>

<P>Where's Don Guzman, where's my master. Oh gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen!</P>

<P>Lazarillo, have you seen a ghost?</P>

<P>You have hit it, the house is haunted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, with a pack of mad people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spirits, Sir, spirits—As I am a living man, your son, Don Alonzo appeared to me this instant, upon the stairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, you simpleton, you have seen a white sheet, or a cat run across you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I saw your son, in his regimental cloaths; I saw him as plain as I see you—His face was as long as my arm, and as pale as a piece of chalk; his eyes glared like two coals of fire, and he had a flambeau in his hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't believe a word of this, it's all a monstrous lie—A ghost, and a piece of chalk, and a flambeau, and stuff; draw all your swords and follow me.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why does she faint this way!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I'll tell you; <STAGE>(falling on her knees.)</STAGE> I'll tell you, Sir, if you'll promise not to be angry; for I find it is in vain to keep the thing a secret from you any longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll not be angry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lady has done nothing she need be ashamed of, Sir.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, so I am in hopes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nor are either she, or I, to blame; for the person that's here, got in, without our knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What person?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, don't be angry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you I won't be angry; I am only thunder-struck. Here, you, man, ghost, devil, or whatever you are, make your appearance; I protest before Heaven, I'll do you no harm, but forgive you all, and let you go quietly about your business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ghost! the ghost! the ghost!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fool, the blockhead, the ass. I could find in my heart to thrash you while I am able to stand over you.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> with his mask on, and his sword drawn. After advancing some paces towards the middle, he discovers himself.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don Guzman, I take you at your word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Omn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don Carlos de Pimentel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call in the alguazils.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, come back. How have you the audaciousness, Don Carlos▪ to appear in this place? And what do you think must be the consequence of my seeing you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came not to Madrid to brave your en∣mity, Don Guzman, but to engage the assistance of my friends. I was invited by this lady, to this house, where, by a train of accidents, as extraor∣dinary as unavoidable, I have been shut up against my will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is true. To be more particular, or to tell you how I became entangled in the same perplexities with him, is what neither our present situation, or the state of my spirits will allow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you kill my son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have been unworthy to live my∣self, had I supported an affront from any man; condemn not me, but custom, which makes such
<PB N="102" REF="118"/>
resentments laudable. Your son was the agres∣sor; I came not upon him like a bravo, or an as∣sassin, but where the injury was received, in the face of day, staked my life upon the justness of my quar∣rel. The same chance, which led my sword to Don Alonzo's breast, might have directed his to mine: the fall of your son rendered me unhappy, but could not make me guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Fer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Uncle, on what do you ruminate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have delivered myself into your hands, Don Guzman, on the faith of your promise, that the memory of all past acts should be cancelled be∣tween us; but conscious of my innocence, I disdain to owe my safety to an undesigned clemency; recall what you have said, I release you from your word, if you can have more pleasure in satisfying an unjust revenge, than in sacrificing it to a point of honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go away, and never let me see you more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>This may do for you, Don Guzman, but I am to be answered in another manner. The death of a son may be forgiven, but not the ruin of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ster.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don Pedro, I never wrong'd you. I honour, I esteem, I admire your sister; and not out of fear of your anger, but in regard to her virtues, and as a debt due to her reputation, brought into danger, by her attention to me, I am willing to make her my wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is the flambeaux you had just now? If you have left it behind you, it may burn the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Flambeaux, Sir, I had no such thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you say he had a flambeaux?</P>
</SP>

<P>There is one circumstance, in this dark affair, which surprizes me more than any thing else. Where is your servant, Don Carlos, whom I seized

just now in the street? I left him locked up here, and in less than a quarter of an hour—</P>

<P>I am included in the treaty, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What place have we got here? This brings things into my head. Hark, you rogue's face, was not it you that stole my gown?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Si, Signora.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, and where is it?</P>

<P>Why, you must know I put it on.</P>

<SPEAKER>Beat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Put on my gown!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Lord, yes; I make one of the genteelest ladies you ever laid your eyes on; ask Don Guz∣man else. Being somewhat more corpulent than you, indeed, your gown has suffered a little in the seams; but don't make yourself uneasy; to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om∣pence the damage, when our things come from Por∣tugal, I'll make you a present of one of the sweetest pretty creatures of a lap-dog, between a mastiff and an Italian greyhound, about this high from the ground—<STAGE>(holding his hand about a yard up.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>

<P>Hang your filthy mongrel, he's fit for no∣thing but to watch a tan-yard. Make your master give me a new gown, for the one you have spoiled.</P>

<P>Here's my hand, it shall be done.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Coming forward with <HI>Don Pedro)</HI></STAGE> This is the fact, as well as it can be related, in a few words; wait, if you please, to be farther satisfied; but re∣member,

I can have no motive for deceiving you; and the way is open for an honourable reconci∣liation▪ before scandal and falsehood—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D Ped.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you tell me is very odd; however that is not a sufficient reason for my doubting the truth of it. Don Carlos, we have no leisure now, to enter into discussions and explanations; your fa∣mily and fortune are unexceptionable; you say you are willing to marry my sister; take her, and may you be happy together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Guz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don Pedro, I have a great regard both for you and yours, but I cannot suffer Don Carlos to stay longer in my house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Car.</SPEAKER>
<P>Conscious of the indelicacy, I will quit it immediately. Nay more, I will for some months, or longer if you please, return to my exile at Lisbon; yet let me hope, that time may open a way to our re-union, at least so far—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aur.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, Don Guzman, when you hear the history of the three last days Don Carlos has past, you will allow there is something so uncom∣mon, and extraordinary—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Musk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody can give a better account of that matter than I; and whenever Don Guzman permits me, I will do myself the honour to wait upon him, and entertain him with our whole adventure. In the mean time, to the very ground I thank him for all favours; wishing him health, happiness, and long life.—Of you also, young gentleman and lady, I take my leave:—and of you, Mrs. Beatrice, whom I will attend, within this week, to the mercer's, for a new silk gown; though I am oblig'd to pay for it out of my wages.—And, lastly, my dear master. I wish you joy, from the bottom of my heart, of being released from all your troubles, by the gene∣rosity of this good old gentleman: his be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aviour has been that of a noble Spaniard; and I hope our friends will testify their satisfaction, by joining to applaud it.</P>
