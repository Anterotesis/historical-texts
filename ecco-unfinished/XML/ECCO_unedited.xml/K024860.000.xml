<HEAD>TO CALEB D'ANVERS, <ABBR><HI>Esq</HI></ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> BELIEVE the Hint, which you or one of your Correspondents some Time ago gave us, <HI>That the neglecting the Guard of the Seas hath formerly been made an Ar∣ticle of Impeachment,</HI> may have had some Effect, where you intended it should ope∣rate. The Author of the <HI>Observations on the Conduct,</HI> &amp;c. acknowledges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations, <HI>pag.</HI> 5.</NOTE>, <HI>That an Accusation on this Head must necessarily raise the Indignation of the Publick against the Government</HI> (he should have said the <HI>Ministers) if it be found true:</HI> And ad∣mits that <HI>Letters of Marque</HI> and <HI>Reprisal</HI> are what our <HI>Merchants,</HI> in our late Situa∣tion, with Regard to <HI>Spain, had a Right to demand;</HI> which, I think, is a Principle you had some where laid down; and seems to have been extorted from him by the
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
meer Force <HI>of</HI> Truth. How then does <HI>this Gentleman</HI> vindicate the Measures, which have been lately taken <HI>here,</HI> on Account of the <HI>Spanish Depredations?</HI> Why, he endeavours to persuade us, that the <HI>Depre∣dations,</HI> committed by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are not near so <HI>considerable</HI> as they have been <HI>represented;</HI> that the Commanders of His Majesty's Squadrons, in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> had Orders to <HI>protect our Commerce,</HI> and make <HI>Reprisals;</HI> and that proper Steps were taken here for granting <HI>Letters of Marque.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are the Concessions which this <HI>Licensed Advocate</HI> for the <HI>M — rs</HI> has made; and these are his Heads of their <HI>Defence.</HI></P>
<P>HE enters on the Account of the <HI>Losses,</HI> suffered by our Merchants in the <HI>West-In∣dies,</HI> in the genuine Spirit of a <HI>modern Court Instrument.</HI> He observes, with Pity and In∣dignation, the gross Imposition and daily Abuses, which the Publick has suffered from <HI>ignorant and bold Pretenders to Politicks.</HI> He commiserates the Case of <HI>Those,</HI> whose private Fortunes are ruined by <HI>National Quarrels:</HI> But a due Regard for <HI>Truth,</HI> and a just Concern for <HI>those,</HI> who may have been <HI>uninformed,</HI> oblige him to en∣quire into <HI>Facts,</HI> and to lay before the
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Publick the Result of his <HI>Enquiries.</HI> Ac∣cordingly he favours us with, <HI>what he calls,</HI> a <HI>List of Ships</HI> taken from his Majesty's Subjects in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> since the 3d of <HI>September,</HI> 1725, collected from the most <HI>Authentick Testimonies.</HI> He tells us that the whole Number of these Losses does not exceed 26 Ships. Nay, to give the <HI>Spaniards</HI> their Due, they make but 25 (for <HI>one</HI> of the Ships was the Property of his <HI>Majesty</HI>) And of these, 6 together a∣mount to no more than 340 Tons. <HI>Yet this,</HI> says he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations, <HI>pag.</HI> 29.</NOTE>, <HI>Is the long and black Ca∣talogue of</HI> British <HI>Ships taken from us by the</HI> Spaniards. <HI>These are the heavy and severe Losses, which have ruined so many of our Traders to the Plantations. These are the Losses, which have reduced so many Families to Misery.</HI> I suppose, Mr. <HI>D'An∣vers,</HI> you have some where or other talk'd at this Rate; because I observe the Author exclaims in <HI>Italicks;</HI> which, among us <HI>Party-Advocates,</HI> is as much as to say, <HI>Thus say the Gentlemen on the</HI> other <HI>Side.</HI> But if it should appear that <HI>those,</HI> whose Defence <HI>this Author</HI> undertakes, and <HI>those,</HI> who have argued on <HI>his</HI> Side of the Question, have talk'd of the <HI>Spanish Depredations</HI> in the same, or a higher Strain, he must set down
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
under the Mortification of seeing the <HI>Dirt</HI> he aim'd at you light, where I dare an∣swer for him he does not <HI>at present</HI> in∣tend it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> who doubtless was fur∣nished with <HI>authentick Testimonies,</HI> in a <HI>Me∣morial</HI> to the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> dated <HI>Septem∣ber</HI> 24, 1726, speaking of the <HI>Spanish De∣predations</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> says, <HI>The notorious Infractions, which the</HI> Spanish Guarda Costas <HI>have</HI> for a long Time <HI>made, with Respect to the Commerce and Navi∣gation of his Majesty's Subjects in the</HI> West-Indies; <HI>Infractions, which have been openly complained of, without the least Assurance of</HI> Satisfaction, <HI>or</HI> Reparation. <HI>These Things — are sufficient to exhibit the Reasons, which induc'd his Majesty to — equip the several Fleets he hath put to Sea.</HI> The <HI>same Minister,</HI> in a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">November 25, 1726.</NOTE> <HI>Letter</HI> on the same Subject to the Marquis <HI>de la Paz,</HI> says, <HI>When, notwithstanding the frequent Re∣presentations I have made, They</HI> (the Court of <HI>Spain) have not thought fit to put an End to the</HI> Depredations <HI>and</HI> open Hosti∣lities, <HI>which have been, for some Time, al∣most daily committed in these Parts</HI> (the <HI>West-Indies) by the</HI> Spaniards; <HI>or to give the King the least Satisfaction for the
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Damages done to his Subjects in</HI> Violation of all Treaties: <HI>Damages, so many and so great, that this Treatment from his</HI> Ca∣tholick Majesty <HI>would have</HI> sufficiently <HI>ju∣stified the King's taking the</HI> most <HI>vigorous Measures for Redress. By this true and impartial State of what has passed be∣tween the two Courts, it will appear, not only how much the King, my Master, has been injured; but how great his Modera∣tion and Love of Peace has been, in for∣bearing to resent these notorious Infracti∣ons of Treaties — and the Hostilities com∣mitted against his Subjects</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> This <HI>Letter</HI> and <HI>Memorial</HI> were published, among others, by <HI>Buckley,</HI> about the Time the <HI>Enquiry</HI> came out.</NOTE>. You see, Sir, that his <HI>late Majesty,</HI> by his <HI>Minister,</HI> above two Years ago, complained of <HI>Ho∣stilities</HI> committed against his Subjects; <HI>open Hostilities,</HI> that had been <HI>then a long Time,</HI> and were <HI>almost daily</HI> committed, in Viola∣tion of all <HI>Treaties; Hostilities,</HI> that had been <HI>then openly</HI> complained <HI>of,</HI> but with∣out <HI>Satisfaction</HI> or <HI>Redress;</HI> Hostilities, that would have <HI>sufficiently justified</HI> the <HI>most vigorous Measures</HI> for Redress. And yet <HI>now</HI> a <HI>nameless Author,</HI> who pretends to proceed upon <HI>Facts,</HI> and the <HI>most authen∣tick Testimonies,</HI> complains that the <HI>Spanish Depredations</HI> have been <HI>magnified</HI> from very <HI>wicked Views;</HI> and, in Order to shew that they are not so <HI>considerable</HI> as they
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
have been represented, publishes a <HI>List of Ships,</HI> all taken <HI>since</HI> the Dates of the <HI>Let∣ter</HI> and <HI>Memorial;</HI> for though he entitles it a <HI>List of Ships</HI> taken since <HI>September</HI> 1725; the <HI>first Capture,</HI> in Point of Time, mentioned in the <HI>List,</HI> was so late as <HI>March</HI> 1726-7.</P>
<P>IT would be a Reflection on the Me∣mory of his <HI>late Majesty,</HI> as well as inju∣rious to the Character of Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> to produce any further Evidence by Way of Proof in the Case. A <HI>Fact</HI> so well attest∣ed needs none. But perhaps it may teach our <HI>Author</HI> a little Modesty for the future, if we let him see that <HI>other Gentlemen,</HI> be∣sides yourself; <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> not suspected of writing on <HI>your Side,</HI> have represented the <HI>Spanish Depredations</HI> in the very Manner he complains of. I'll mention but one; the Author of the <HI>Enquiry.</HI> He tells us more than once, that the <HI>Protection of his Ma∣jesty's Trading Subjects from the Depreda∣tions of the</HI> Spaniards <HI>was one End of set∣ting out the Squadrons under Admiral</HI> Ho∣sier, <HI>and Sir</HI> John Jennings. And speaking of the <HI>Vienna Treaty,</HI> asks,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, <HI>pag.</HI> 60.</NOTE> <HI>Will these Depredations and Hostilities committed in the</HI> West-Indies <HI>by the</HI> Spaniards; <HI>these Violences, by which the</HI> whole <HI>Commerce of</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Jamaica <HI>has been</HI> well nigh destroyed, <HI>and the Trade of that Island reduced to a</HI> mise∣rable <HI>Condition, be now redressed?</HI> And a∣gain to the same Purpose;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, <HI>pag.</HI> 94.</NOTE> <HI>As to the Squa∣drons sent to the</HI> West-Indies, <HI>I believe there is no one, who has an Estate in these Parts, or is concerned in</HI> any <HI>Trade thi∣ther, who did not think it highly necessary to have a strong Squadron in those Seas for se∣curing our Commerce; which must otherwise have been</HI> inevitably ruined, <HI>by the Depre∣dations and Violences committed by the</HI> Spa∣niards <HI>for several Years past without Re∣dress.</HI> Now, was the whole Commerce of <HI>Jamaica</HI> (one of our most valuable Settle∣ments in <HI>America</HI>) well <HI>nigh destroyed</HI> by the <HI>Spanish Depredations?</HI> Must our Trade to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> (the best Branch of our Trade) have been <HI>inevitably ruined,</HI> if we had not, at a vast Expence and Hazard, sent a strong Squadron thither to protect it? Have <HI>Hostilities</HI> been committed on our Mer∣chants for several Years past without Re∣dress? Was this <HI>true above two Years ago;</HI> and was it <HI>Meritorious</HI> to say so <HI>then?</HI> How comes it to be <HI>Criminal</HI> to say much less <HI>now,</HI> after our Misfortunes have been aggravated by <HI>fresh Injuries</HI> of the same Kind?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9"/>I DO not deny or dispute the Truth of the <HI>List,</HI> which this Author has thought fit to publish <HI>as far as it goes.</HI> I am not qua∣lified for that Task; I leave it to Those, who are; though, I confess, I cannot reconcile the <HI>List</HI> to Mr. <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s <HI>Letter</HI> and <HI>Me∣morial,</HI> or to the <HI>Enquiry,</HI> which in 1726 speak of the <HI>Spanish Depredations</HI> as a <HI>daily Insult</HI> on us at <HI>that Time,</HI> which had neither been interrupted nor redressed.</P>
<P>BUT what I insist on is, that admitting his <HI>List</HI> to be <HI>true,</HI> it proves nothing that was incumbent on him to prove; it an∣swers no View, for which an honest Man would make himself accountable. He<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, <HI>pag.</HI> 4.</NOTE> ob∣serves, that the <HI>late Libels have been chiefly filled with Invectives on the sup∣posed Inactivity of our Squadrons, and the Depredations</HI> (without Limitation in Point of Time) <HI>committed by the</HI> Spaniards <HI>on our Merchants in the</HI> West-Indies; <HI>and therefore he has applied himself with the greatest Care and Impartiality to be in∣formed of the true State of these Particu∣lars.</HI> And again,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 20.</NOTE> <HI>I shall now proceed to give some Account of the Losses suffered by our Merchants</HI> (without Limitation in Point of Time) <HI>in the</HI> West-Indies; <HI>which,
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
according to these Gentlemen, have reduced so many Families to Misery:</HI> And further,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, <HI>pag.</HI> 21.</NOTE> <HI>I come now to give the Account I pro∣mised, of what I have collected with Re∣lation to the</HI> Spanish <HI>Depredations</HI> (still without Limitation of Time) <HI>in the</HI> West-Indies. And after he has given us his <HI>List,</HI> he cries out,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 29.</NOTE> <HI>Yet this is the Long and Black Catalogue of</HI> British <HI>Ships taken from us by the</HI> Spaniards! — Would not every one of this Gentleman's <HI>uninformed</HI> Rea∣ders, Those at least, who had seen the <HI>En∣quiry,</HI> imagine that this Dealer in <HI>authen∣tick Testimonies,</HI> was giving a <HI>List</HI> of <HI>those Captures,</HI> at least, which make so frightful a Figure in <HI>that Pamphlet?</HI> Or does <HI>this Author</HI> imagine, that the <HI>Libellers,</HI> as he calls them, did not take the <HI>Depredations</HI> complained of in Mr. <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s <HI>Letter</HI> and <HI>Memorial</HI> into <HI>their Account?</HI> He com∣plains,<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 5.</NOTE> that the Losses of our Merchants, in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> have been <HI>magnified</HI> by his Adversaries; whom he represents as<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 21.</NOTE> imposing on the Publick by repeated Falshoods, <HI>urged with Solemnity and Se∣riousness,</HI> and frequent Appeals to the <HI>Mer∣chants</HI> on this very Head. Now, if this be the Case, it is not to be doubted, that in <HI>their Account</HI> of the Merchants Losses, they
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
go as far back as the <HI>Enquiry</HI> does: And if they express themselves on the Subject with equal <HI>Solemnity and Seriousness;</HI> it must be owned that They have <HI>equal Truth</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> on their Side.</P>
<P>THIS Harmony and exact Consistency between <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Foes,</HI> in an important Point, rendered the Case extremely <HI>nice</HI> and <HI>perplexing.</HI> It was not safe to admit that our Losses had been <HI>considerable</HI> at any Time, <HI>since our refusing the sole Mediation at</HI> Cambray, and the breaking up of the <HI>Congress;</HI> for <HI>that</HI> might have given Mr. <HI>D'Anvers</HI> Occasion for some <HI>malicious Triumph:</HI> Nor was it adviseable to deny, that our Losses had been very great <HI>since that Time;</HI> for <HI>that</HI> would have been giving the Lye to Mr. <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s <HI>Letter</HI> and <HI>Me∣morial,</HI> and disowning the <HI>Enquiry.</HI> So that, <HI>quâcunque viâ,</HI> the Danger is great! But our <HI>Author</HI>'s Abilities are equal to all Difficulties of that Kind. He saw it would be of Service to his <HI>Masters</HI> to <HI>limit</HI> the Account of the <HI>Spanish Captures,</HI> as much as possible, in Point of Time; and there∣fore with singular Dexterity he shifts the Scene; and, instead of giving a <HI>full Ac∣count</HI> of these Captures (which was what he promised) he all of a sudden drops his Subject, and grows mighty sollicitous for the Defence of the <HI>Hanover Treaty;</HI> and
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, <HI>pag.</HI> 29.</NOTE> undertakes to shew that our Losses ought not to be ascribed to the Measures taken <HI>at</HI> or <HI>since</HI> the <HI>Hanover Treaty;</HI> because, says he, <HI>Our Losses since that Period, have not exceeded those of former more peaceful Times;</HI> and <HI>particularly they did not ex∣ceed our Losses for the three Years next after the Treaty at</HI> Utrecht.</P>
<P>IF the <HI>Hanover Treaty</HI> had been the Subject of Debate between <HI>this Gentleman</HI> and his <HI>Libellers;</HI> and if our Losses <HI>since</HI> that Period <HI>alone</HI> had been the Subject of Complaint, it might have been proper for him, with Regard to his <HI>Adversaries,</HI> to have confined himself to <HI>that Period.</HI> But that was not, nor could possibly be the Case; for the Question <HI>this Gentleman</HI> is con∣cerned to answer, is not, <HI>when</HI> or <HI>where,</HI> but whether the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have not, for a <HI>long Time past,</HI> committed <HI>daily Hostilities</HI> on our Merchants; and whether those Hostilities have been <HI>resented</HI> in a proper Manner. Why then does his <HI>Account</HI> go no farther back than the <HI>Hanover Treaty?</HI> And why is it confined to Ships taken in the <HI>West-Indies?</HI> The Answer is easy. He saw that Complaints on this Subject <HI>had</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 7.</NOTE> <HI>made Impressions on some Persons, who are</HI> sincerely <HI>concerned for the Interest and
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Honour of their Country.</HI> He knew that a <HI>true Representation</HI> of the Case would strengthen those <HI>Impressions;</HI> and therefore honestly contents himself, and hopes to sa∣tisfy his <HI>uninformed</HI> Readers, with a very <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>defective</HI> View of our Con∣dition.</P>
<P>YET this is the <HI>Gentleman, who com∣miserates as much as any Body those, whose private Fortunes are ruined by National Quarrels;</HI> and complains, <HI>that our Losses have been magnified with a particular Pleasure</HI> by the Writers on the <HI>other Side;</HI> whom he represents as having raised a groundless Clamour on this Head. Whe∣ther <HI>these Writers,</HI> with the <HI>Author of the Enquiry,</HI> have <HI>magnified</HI> our Losses; or whether <HI>this Writer</HI> has not <HI>stifled the Truth</HI> from <HI>corrupt</HI> and <HI>wicked Views;</HI> and, in a most insolent Manner, played with our <HI>Misfortunes,</HI> by giving a <HI>par∣tial Account</HI> of them, is for the present submitted to every Reader's Judgment; though the final Decision of these impor∣tant Questions must be left to that happy Day, when it will appear to the Satis∣faction of an <HI>injured People,</HI> that what <HI>this Gentleman</HI> is instructed to call the <HI>Clamours of Discontent,</HI> are the Cries and Efforts of <HI>real Distress</HI> and <HI>unfeigned Commiseration.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>I CANNOT dismiss this Head, of the <HI>Spanish Depredations,</HI> without clearing up <HI>one Point,</HI> in which the Writers on <HI>both Sides</HI> seem to be generally mistaken. The <HI>Merchants</HI> have been often reproached with <HI>Negligence,</HI> in not carrying in an Account of their <HI>Losses</HI> to the <HI>Commis∣sioners of Trade,</HI> who sate, as it is said, for some Time on Purpose to receive them. The Author of the <HI>Observations</HI> tells us, that he formed his <HI>List</HI> partly from the <HI>Ac∣count</HI> delivered in to <HI>these Gentlemen;</HI> and I think your Correspondent <HI>Raleigh,</HI> in his Answer to that <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> takes it for granted that the <HI>Commissioners</HI> did sit to re∣ceive <HI>such Accounts;</HI> which I am assured is absolutely <HI>False.</HI> The Case it seems was thus. A Paragraph having been inserted in one of the <HI>News-Papers,</HI> that the <HI>Lords Com∣missioners of Trade and Plantations would sit,</HI> at such a Time, <HI>to receive an Account of the</HI> Spanish <HI>Captures,</HI> several Merchants attended them, in Pursuance of this Notice; but when they came to the <HI>Board,</HI> they were told that the <HI>Paragraph</HI> was publish∣ed without their <HI>Order</HI> or <HI>Knowledge;</HI> that they had no <HI>Directions</HI> to take Cog∣nizance of <HI>these Losses;</HI> but since they were come, they might, if they thought fit, talk over the Affair, and They (the <HI>Com∣missioners</HI>) would make the best Use of it
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
in their Power, at a proper Opportunity Upon this the Merchants, who attended, did give them some Account of their <HI>own particu∣lar Losses;</HI> but when they return'd into the <HI>City,</HI> they told their <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Fellow-Suf∣ferers</HI> how the Case stood; which no Doubt was the Reason that others did not think it worth their while to give in their Accounts. — Now if this be the <HI>Fact</HI> (as I am as∣sured it is) let the World judge whether it is not very extraordinary to reproach the Merchants with <HI>Negligence</HI> in this Af∣fair, and to assert that the <HI>Commissioners</HI> did sit for this Purpose; and yet this, I am told, hath been asserted both <HI>within</HI> and <HI>without Doors.</HI></P>
<P>OUR <HI>Author</HI> having dispatched the Af∣fair of the <HI>Spanish Captures,</HI> and endea∣voured to shew that they were not near so <HI>considerable</HI> as they had been represented, proceeds to the Business of <HI>Letters of Marque and Reprisal;</HI> which he admits,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, <HI>pag.</HI> 35.</NOTE> <HI>Our Merchants, in the Situation we were</HI> then <HI>in, with Regard to</HI> Spain, <HI>had a Right, both by our own Law, and that of Nations, to</HI> demand: And in order to shew that <HI>such Letters</HI> were not <HI>refused,</HI> he gives us an Extract of an <HI>Order of Council,</HI> dated the 28th Day of <HI>March,</HI> 1727. This <HI>Or∣der,</HI> every Body sees, proves only that the
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
<HI>Ministers</HI> might be <HI>then</HI> in a Disposition to grant <HI>Letters of Marque;</HI> but does not prove the Point, for which he produces it; which is, that <HI>Letters of Marque had not been refused.</HI> He does not indeed under∣take to say whether <HI>Letters of Marque</HI> had been refused <HI>before</HI> that Time; which I dare say he would not have omitted, if it would have served his Purpose; because he forgets not to let his Readers know, that no<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, <HI>pag.</HI> 37.</NOTE> Application for <HI>Letters of Marque</HI> hath been made <HI>since</HI> the Death of his late Ma∣jesty, except in the <HI>two Cases</HI> he mentions.</P>
<P>IT seems, at first Sight, a little extraor∣dinary that <HI>this Gentleman</HI> should come so readily into a Concession, that our Mer∣chants had a <HI>Right to demand Letters of Marque;</HI> But as it was of Importance to him to put on the Air of <HI>Impartiality,</HI> which <HI>this Concession</HI> has given him, so has he taken special Care that <HI>good Words</HI> shall not do him, or his Masters, the least Preju∣dice. Says he, In the Situation we were <HI>then</HI> in, the Merchants had <HI>this Right. Then — When?</HI> I have carefully look'd over the whole Passage, and cannot find, by any Thing that precedes this Concession, to what <HI>Point of Time</HI> it is limited: So that as it stands here, it amounts to no more than this; that at <HI>some Times,</HI> and under
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
<HI>some Circumstances,</HI> our Merchants may have a <HI>Right to demand Letters of Marque.</HI> But since our <HI>Author</HI> is so cautious of declaring to our Merchants, at <HI>what Time,</HI> and under <HI>what Circumstances,</HI> they have <HI>this Right;</HI> I'll venture to tell them that, when <HI>open Hostilities are daily, and have been, for a long Time, committed</HI> upon them by a fo∣reign Power, without <HI>Satisfaction or Re∣dress;</HI> especially when these Hostilities have been repeated <HI>after frequent Complaints to that Power;</HI> when such Hostilities <HI>are so many and so great, as would sufficiently justify our taking the most</HI> vigorous Mea∣sures <HI>for Redress;</HI> at <HI>such a Time,</HI> if ever, they have a <HI>Right to demand Letters of Marque.</HI> Mr. <HI>Stanhope's Letter</HI> and <HI>Me∣morial,</HI> with the <HI>Enquiry,</HI> to which I have before referred, are a Proof, better than ten Thousand of our Author's <HI>authentick Ac∣counts,</HI> that this was the Case of our Mer∣chants, with Regard to <HI>Spain,</HI> long before it is so much as suggested, that any Steps were taken <HI>here</HI> towards granting <HI>Letters of Marque.</HI> Our <HI>Author</HI> was aware that <HI>frequent Hostilities,</HI> committed on <HI>one Side,</HI> would justify <HI>Hostilities</HI> of the like Kind on the <HI>other;</HI> or, to speak more properly, would make it the <HI>Duty</HI> of the <HI>other Side</HI> to authorize the <HI>like Hostilities;</HI> and there∣fore, as well as for the Reasons mentioned before, his <HI>List</HI> of the <HI>Spanish Captures</HI>

begins in <HI>March</HI> 1726-7, just ten Days be∣fore the Date of the <HI>first Order of Coun∣cil,</HI> in Relation to <HI>Letters of Marque.</HI> But if he had favour'd us with a <HI>full Account</HI> of the <HI>Spanish Depredations,</HI> and had gone as far back in that Account as the <HI>Memorial</HI> and <HI>Enquiry</HI> must be supposed to go, it would have appeared that our <HI>Merchants</HI> had been <HI>Insulted,</HI> and our <HI>Trade to the</HI> West-Indies <HI>well nigh ruined,</HI> not <HI>Months,</HI> but <HI>Years before</HI> a single Step appears to have been taken towards granting <HI>Letters of Marque;</HI> which yet our <HI>Author</HI> admits our Merchants had a <HI>Right to demand.</HI> He says, indeed, that the Commanders of our Squadrons <HI>had Orders to protect our Trade,</HI> and refers to <HI>his own Extracts</HI> from <HI>those Orders,</HI> for a Proof of his Assertion. I have carefully looked over <HI>these Extracts,</HI> and find that Admiral <HI>Hosier,</HI> and those, who succeeded him in that Service,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, <HI>pag.</HI> 13.</NOTE> <HI>were to look on the stopping the Galleons, and their Treasure, as their</HI> chief <HI>Care; and therefore they were not to risque the Suc∣cess of it</HI> on any Account<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 8, 9.</NOTE>. <HI>To that End they were to</HI> remain <HI>at</HI> Carthagena, <HI>or</HI> Porto Bello, <HI>or the</HI> Havana, <HI>as the Case should happen, to block up the Galleons in such of those Ports, where they should chance to
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
find them.</HI> They have indeed Orders to <HI>protect our Trade in the</HI> West-Indies; but still, if they should find the <HI>Galleons</HI> in Port, as in Fact they did, they were <HI>there to remain.</HI> If any of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came in their Way, they might possibly make Prize of them for their Temerity; but I think 'tis evident that they were not to re∣move from the Station proper for blocking up the <HI>Galleons on any Account.</HI> Whether our <HI>Commerce</HI> could be <HI>protected</HI> by our Squadrons remaining in <HI>one Station,</HI> which the <HI>Spanish Privateers</HI> might easily avoid; or, whether it was necessary to <HI>cruize,</HI> in Order to intercept them, is left to the Judg∣ment of <HI>Those,</HI> who are acquainted with the Nature of that Service.</P>
<P>THE <HI>preventing the Return of the Gal∣leons</HI> and <HI>Flotilla</HI> with their Treasure, was to be the <HI>chief Care</HI> of the Commanders of that Squadron; and yet the <HI>Admirals</HI> had it not in Commission to prevent the <HI>re-landing</HI> of the Treasure, or to <HI>seize it in Port.</HI> This, I think, is admitted by <HI>this Author.</HI> But I will venture to go one Step further. If the <HI>Galleons had put to Sea</HI> with their Treasure; or if our <HI>Admirals had met them at Sea,</HI> they had no Com∣mission (I mean it was not in their <HI>In∣structions</HI> of the 28th <HI>of March</HI> 1716)
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
to <HI>seize</HI> them. They were indeed, in such Case,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, <HI>pag.</HI> 10.</NOTE> <HI>to use their best Endeavours, by</HI> Persuasion, <HI>or</HI> even <HI>by Force, to get them and their Cargoes into their Possession.</HI> I have heard that it hath been maliciously asked, Whether a <HI>British Squadron</HI> was ever before fitted out, at a vast Expence, for a long and hazardous Voyage, to play the <HI>Pedants,</HI> and <HI>endeavour to persuade?</HI> To <HI>persuade</HI> an Enemy to part with an immense Treasure; which, according to this Writer,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>His late Majesty had Reason to believe they intended to employ for Disturb∣ing the Tranquility of</HI> Europe? No; the Admirals were <HI>even</HI> to use <HI>Force.</HI> But would a <HI>wise Man,</HI> who considers the Risque and Consequence <HI>to himself</HI> of striking the <HI>first Blow</HI> in a War, that may involve his Country and all <HI>Europe</HI> in a Flame; would he (I say) use the <HI>Force</HI> that was necessary for <HI>seizing the Gal∣leons</HI> upon such <HI>dark,</HI> and <HI>ambiguous Or∣ders</HI> as these? <HI>Persuasion</HI> is to be first tried; and what <HI>Methods</HI> or <HI>Degrees</HI> of <HI>Persuasion,</HI> on <HI>one Side;</HI> and what <HI>Obsti∣nacy</HI> on the <HI>other,</HI> might, in such a Case, have been thought sufficient to justify <HI>Force,</HI> is a Question of too Nice a Nature for a <HI>prudent Commander</HI> to risque his Head up∣on. But I think it is plain, from<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 4.</NOTE> a <HI>subse∣quent
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
Order,</HI> that this little <HI>hectoring</HI> Word <HI>Force</HI> did not authorise the <HI>Admirals</HI> to <HI>seize</HI> the <HI>Galleons at Sea:</HI> For<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, <HI>pag.</HI> 14.</NOTE> on the 19th Day of <HI>May</HI> 1727 (above a Year after the Date of the <HI>first Orders) Hosier</HI> was informed, that <HI>the King of</HI> Spain <HI>being at War with his Majesty, it was the King's Pleasure,</HI> instead <HI>of stopping the Galleons</HI> only, <HI>as he had been formerly directed, he should</HI> now <HI>seize them.</HI> If the <HI>first Orders</HI> impowered him to <HI>seize</HI> them, what need of these <HI>new Orders</HI> to the same Purpose? But this is not all. These <HI>In∣structions</HI> expresly say, that his <HI>first Orders</HI> impowered him <HI>only to stop them.</HI> By <HI>these,</HI> he is directed to do something else; some∣thing that his <HI>first Orders</HI> did not extend to; something <HI>instead</HI> of the Service re∣quired by the <HI>first,</HI> which is to <HI>seize them.</HI> So that taking <HI>these Orders</HI> together, it is evident that our <HI>Admiral,</HI> whose chief Con∣cern was to prevent the <HI>Return of the Galleons and their Treasure,</HI> was above a Year in that Service, without Commission to <HI>seize the Treasure;</HI> and yet he was to <HI>stop the Galleons,</HI> and get them and their Cargoes <HI>into his Possession by Force,</HI> without <HI>seizing of them.</HI></P>
<P>IF these are <HI>Inconsistencies,</HI> which can∣not be imputed to the <HI>Ministers,</HI> I am not
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
accountable for them. They are such as <HI>this Advocate</HI> of theirs, this <HI>Retailer</HI> of <HI>au∣thentick Intelligence,</HI> has furnished me with. His <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> considered in itself, is a <HI>dry, trifling Performance,</HI> without <HI>Method, Stile</HI> or <HI>Spirit;</HI> and were it not for a few Scraps of <HI>State-Papers,</HI> which he deals out to his Customers, his Book would appear to me a very harmless Thing. But as a Fellow, without common Parts, if he has been, or but pretends to have been, in the Whisper of the <HI>Levee,</HI> can set the <HI>Lye of the Day</HI> going, till 'tis whisper'd in every Coffee-house in Town; so an <HI>Au∣thor,</HI> who builds upon <HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Dates,</HI> and such like <HI>stubborn Things,</HI> will meet with Credit among the Vulgar; <HI>The Great Vulgar and the Small.</HI> Appealing to <HI>Ori∣ginal Papers,</HI> to which the World cannot have Resort, gives an <HI>Author</HI> a double Ad∣vantage; as it looks like <HI>plain Dealing</HI> with his Reader, and at the same Time gives a Man an <HI>Air of Importance. This Man,</HI> says the courteous Reader, <HI>is in the Secret of Affairs; he gives you Chap∣ter and Verse for what he says;</HI> without reflecting that, <HI>original Papers,</HI> to which the Reader cannot have Resort, and espe∣cially <HI>Extracts</HI> from such Papers, are the weakest Sort of Evidence.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT, In Vindication of our <HI>West-India</HI> Mer∣chants against a late Charge of <HI>Theft</HI> and <HI>Pyracy.</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CALEB D'ANVERS of <HI>Gray's-Inn,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></BYLINE>
<P>WHEN I first undertook the Employ∣ment of a <HI>Political Writer,</HI> I had, I confess, the Curiosity to read most of the <HI>Pamphlets</HI> and <HI>Papers,</HI> which were pub∣lished against me; in Order to rectify my <HI>own Mistakes,</HI> as well as to remove those Objections of my <HI>Adversaries,</HI> which I found to be invalid. But their Productions, in general, have been so wretchedly mean, that I soon grew sick of this <HI>Drudgery,</HI> and thought it Loss of Time to look into any of them, till I heard them recommended by <HI>one Party</HI> at least, or found that the <HI>other</HI> expected I should take some Notice of them. For this Reason, I make no Doubt that many of these <HI>profound Scribblers</HI> caress themselves with an Opinion that they have <HI>gall'd</HI> me in Writings, which I never read, or saw, or heard of; unless, perhaps, in <HI>the publick Advertisements.</HI> This would certainly have been the Case of a <HI>little, dirty Composition of Falshood and Scurri∣lity</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
(intitled, <HI>One Word to the Craftsman Extraordinary</HI>) had I not found that some <HI>eminent Merchants,</HI> in <HI>this City,</HI> thought their whole Body (and especially those tra∣ding to the <HI>West-Indies</HI>) most infamously vilified in it, and seemed to desire that so vile an Insult upon them, under all their heavy Losses, might not pass without some Animadversion, at a Time, when they are applying to <HI>Parliament</HI> for <HI>Reparation.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS induc'd, upon <HI>this Account only,</HI> to give the Author of <HI>One Word</HI> a cursory Perusual; and, finding the Complaint just, to bestow a <HI>Word or two</HI> upon it, by way of Reply, in Vindication of our <HI>injur'd Merchants,</HI> without making any Remarks on his <HI>Billingsgate Reflections,</HI> and <HI>impo∣tent Menaces.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>foregoing, excellent Letter</HI> (which I had the Honour to receive from an <HI>un∣known Correspondent</HI>) is, I think, a full Answer not only to the <HI>Observations,</HI> but to this <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> which struts forth as its <HI>Second,</HI> with Regard to the <HI>Spanish De∣predations, Letters of Reprisal,</HI> and the <HI>Instructions of our Commanders in the</HI> West-Indies. But the <HI>Second</HI> hath gone beyond his <HI>Principal</HI> (to whom my <HI>Correspondent</HI> confines himself) in several Points; and as it commonly happens to <HI>had Advocates</HI> of
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
a <HI>bad Cause,</HI> hath left it even much worse than he found it.</P>
<P>HIS chief Design is to prove that our <HI>West-India</HI> Merchants in general, and those of <HI>Jamaica</HI> in particular, are no better than a vile Combination of <HI>Smuglers, Pyrates</HI> and <HI>Thieves,</HI> who make it their Business to <HI>plunder</HI> the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and carry on an <HI>illi∣cit Trade,</HI> contrary to <HI>Treaties;</HI> that the true Reason of their desiring <HI>Letters of Marque</HI> is to secure this <HI>wicked Traffick,</HI> as it is called and not to protect their own <HI>lawful Trade,</HI> or make themselves <HI>just Re∣prizals.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the Charge in express Terms. I will now appeal to the World what Cla∣mours would have been raised against <HI>me,</HI> and what Punishment I should most justly have deserved, had I presumed to treat so <HI>large</HI> and <HI>valuable</HI> a Body of Men in this infamous Manner — I have been often charg∣ed, without any Reason, by the <HI>Writers</HI> against me, and even by some <HI>other Persons,</HI> with <HI>giving Encouragement</HI> to the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> and <HI>furnishing them with Reasons</HI> against coming to an Accommodation; but may not <HI>this Charge</HI> be justly turn'd against the <HI>Writer</HI> before me; or is it possible for him to clear himself from it? Is not the whole Drift of his <HI>Pamphlet</HI> to shew, in
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
the most bare-fac'd Manner, that our <HI>un∣fortunate Merchants</HI> are a Parcel of <HI>law∣less Robbers</HI> and <HI>Buccaneers,</HI> who have no just Pretension to <HI>that Reparation,</HI> which they desire for their many great and heavy Losses? Is not this giving the Lye to the <HI>Enquiry</HI> and the frequent Remonstrances of our <HI>Ministers,</HI> which represent these Cap∣tures, in the strongest Light, as <HI>unjust Vio∣lences, Hostilities</HI> and <HI>Depredations,</HI> and make them one of the chief Motives for sending a <HI>Squadron,</HI> at so vast an Expence, into the <HI>West-Indies?</HI> Is not this giving <HI>Encouragement to our Enemies,</HI> and <HI>fur∣nishing them with Reasons</HI> for <HI>refusing any</HI> Reparation?</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scribler</HI> thinks that he hath clinched this Point of a <HI>Thieving, contra∣band Trade,</HI> by quoting an Extract of a <HI>Letter</HI> from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> published in the <HI>Craftsman;</HI> in which my Correspondent sends me Word, <HI>That the</HI> Guardships <HI>be∣ing gone from thence with the</HI> Galleons, <HI>they have some Prospect of a flourishing Trade again; at least for some Time;</HI> upon which, this <HI>worthy Gentleman</HI> begins to triumph, and cries out, <HI>What can be plain∣er? The</HI> Spanish Guard-Ships <HI>are gone away with the</HI> Galleons; <HI>and now the</HI> Jamaica Smuglers <HI>hope for a good Trade again; or, if you will, the</HI> Cruisers <HI>are gone; the
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
Coast is clear and — we will</HI> THIEVE <HI>on.</HI> Extremely modest and civil indeed! But I cannot see how the <HI>Letter</HI> will justi∣fy such a general Reproach. It hath long been a Complaint that these <HI>Guard Ships,</HI> under the Pretence of preventing <HI>clandestine Trade,</HI> do really obstruct our <HI>lawful Com∣merce,</HI> as it hath been often remonstrated by our <HI>Ministers,</HI> though without Effect, to the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> and what does <HI>my Friend</HI> say more, than that these <HI>these Ships</HI> being now gone, the Gentlemen of <HI>Jamai∣ca</HI> hope to carry on their Trade again, for some Time, without <HI>Molestation?</HI></P>
<P>THE Gentlemen of <HI>this Island,</HI> I pre∣sume, do not pretend to justify themselves so far, as to maintain, or desire the World to believe, that there are no <HI>ill-disposed Persons</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> as well as in other Places, who transgress the Law; and are likewise ready to confess, that some of the Ships, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have taken of late, might be carrying on a <HI>prohibited Trade.</HI> But what they insist upon, and are ready to prove, is, that they are not <HI>all Pyrates</HI> and <HI>Thieves;</HI> that many of them have suffered severe Losses, not only by the Capture of Ships <HI>within Bounds,</HI> and on a <HI>lawful Trade at Sea,</HI> but even by Depre∣dations <HI>on Shore;</HI> That they have, from Time to Time, applied to the <HI>Spanish Go∣vernours</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
of those Places, where their Ships and Effects have been carried, for <HI>Restitu∣tion;</HI> but always without Effect; and have frequently received <HI>Insults, Menaces,</HI> and even<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reader is desired, for his farther Satisfaction in this Point, to consult a Pamphlet, entitled, <HI>The State of Jamaica,</HI> &amp;c. Printed for — <HI>Whitridge,</HI> near the <HI>Royal Exchange.</HI></NOTE> <HI>cruel Ʋsage,</HI> instead of <HI>Redress.</HI> — Whereas on the contrary, they defy the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or this <HI>espaniolized Scribler</HI> to name one <HI>Spanish Vessel,</HI> carried into an <HI>English</HI> Port and <HI>condemned,</HI> unless taken with his <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty's Commission; and if this hath been done, after the Time limited by <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>Cessation,</HI> they appeal to them, whether the <HI>Ships</HI> and <HI>Ef∣fects</HI> have not been punctually <HI>re-delivered</HI> on Oath, unless it hath happened to be in the Hands of some <HI>evil Persons,</HI> whom the Severity of the Law hath driven off the Island; which is all that could be done; Whether they have not had the utmost Justice the Law could give them; whether they have not been handsomely treated by our <HI>Governours,</HI> or whether they were for∣bid to <HI>apply,</HI> or sent away, as our <HI>Claimers</HI> have been, with <HI>Threats</HI> and <HI>Contempt.</HI> — Let them mention any Instances of this Na∣ture, and our Merchants are ready to give up the Point; but as the Case is directly
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
contrary, they think this a proper Time to apply, <HI>at home,</HI> for that Satisfaction and Redress, which they have been so often and so unjustly refused <HI>abroad.</HI> As for Ships taken in either of the <HI>Bays,</HI> laden with <HI>Logwood,</HI> they are never inserted in their <HI>Lists</HI> of Losses; nor do they claim any <HI>Re∣paration</HI> for them at <HI>this Time;</HI> though I am told, they do not allow it to be a <HI>con∣traband Traffick,</HI> but think they have a Right to Trade thither, by Virtue of the <HI>American Treaty.</HI> — But this is no Time to contend for any Thing so doubtful and disputable. Perhaps the <HI>Merchants con∣cerned</HI> may take some other Opportunity to explain their Pretensions on <HI>this Head.</HI></P>
<P>I AM told likewise, that something might be urged in Justification of the <HI>private Trade to the Coast,</HI> which would be, at least, sufficient to secure it from the Imputation of <HI>Felony;</HI> but as that is not proper, I must content my self with observing, that <HI>this scandalous Writer</HI> ought to have been better informed of the POWER of the <HI>Governors of</HI> Jamaica, before he published such undistinguishing Calumny on the Gentlemen of that <HI>Island.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Writer</HI> declines entering into any Detail of the <HI>Number</HI> or <HI>Value</HI> of the
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
<HI>Spanish Captures;</HI> which is, I think, very prudent in him, after he hath condemned them all to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as <HI>lawful Prizes,</HI> being taken, as he tells us, from a Nest of <HI>Pyrates</HI> and <HI>Plunderers.</HI> But as I find, that others of a different Opinion, are de∣sirous to see a <HI>true Account</HI> of these Losses, I design to give my Readers a <HI>true List</HI> of them, according to the best Informa∣tion I shall be able to obtain, without including any taken on what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call the <HI>Prohibited Trade.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there is another Thing, which my <HI>present Adversary</HI> seems to require; with which I am afraid I cannot oblige him; and that is, to deduct out of my <HI>List</HI> all such <HI>British Merchant-men,</HI> as <HI>have been snap∣ped up by</HI> Spanish <HI>Ships or Sloops not in</HI> Commission; <HI>for it must be owned,</HI> says he, <HI>that some of them have been not</HI> Pri∣vateers <HI>but</HI> Pyrates, <HI>and so are not charge∣able on the</HI> Spaniards, <HI>as a Nation, or as a Government.</HI> I am glad to hear that the <HI>British Merchants</HI> and our Fellow-Subjects of <HI>Jamaica</HI> are not the <HI>only Pyrates</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> but though <HI>Ships,</HI> taken with∣out the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s <HI>Commission,</HI> are not <HI>chargeable on him;</HI> yet if it can be proved (as I am told it can) that many of these <HI>Captors</HI> have had Commissions from the
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
<HI>Spanish Governors,</HI> who are themselves often concerned in <HI>these Ships,</HI> I hope the un∣happy Sufferers have some Right to <HI>Repri∣sals;</HI> or, at least, to <HI>Security</HI> from such Practices for the future; and if our <HI>Squa∣dron</HI> had not been <HI>better engaged,</HI> or if <HI>Letters of Marque</HI> had been granted, I doubt not that the Seas would have been soon cleared of <HI>those Ravagers.</HI> I am very unwilling to believe, that this <HI>Forbearance</HI> on <HI>one Side,</HI> and these <HI>vigorous Hostilities,</HI> on the <HI>other,</HI> did proceed from any In∣stances made by <HI>false Friends</HI> to the <HI>for∣mer,</HI> or from the Assurances which the <HI>lat∣ter</HI> received from the <HI>same Persons,</HI> that they might continue their <HI>Depredations,</HI> without any Apprehensions of <HI>Resentment</HI> or <HI>Reprisals.</HI> But one Thing I must take the Liberty to observe; which is, that though the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> accord∣ing to <HI>this Author</HI>'s own Confession, are concerned in this same <HI>Smugling, Thieving, Pyratical Trade,</HI> as well as <HI>our Subjects,</HI> and consequently are equally obnoxious to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> yet very few, if any, of the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch Merchant-men</HI> have had the Misfortune to be <HI>snapp'd up</HI> by the <HI>Spanish Cruizers,</HI> whether <HI>Commissioned</HI> or not, since the <HI>Rupture.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33"/>THIS <HI>worthy Writer</HI> seems to know very little of the <HI>Barlevento Fleet;</HI> which, he says, is a Fleet of <HI>small Men of War,</HI> kept on Purpose to <HI>coast along the Shore, and attack the Logwood Cutters</HI> and <HI>Buc∣caneers;</HI> whereas I am informed, by some Gentlemen acquainted with <HI>Parts,</HI> that <HI>this Fleet</HI> consists of a Number of Vessels, kept only to carry <HI>Money</HI> to St. <HI>Domingo</HI> and <HI>other Settlements,</HI> to pay their <HI>Garrisons.</HI></P>
<P>BUT however this may be (which I cannot pretend absolutely to determine) he is very grosly mistaken, when he says, that none but <HI>West-India Merchants desired Letters of Reprisal;</HI> for if the <HI>Ministry</HI> had thought fit to advise the granting of <HI>such Letters,</HI> he would have found, I be∣lieve, that <HI>many others</HI> would have applied for them; but if the only Design of them was to protect <HI>Those,</HI> who desired them, in Acts of <HI>Theft</HI> and <HI>Pyracy,</HI> I think they were very <HI>wisely</HI> and <HI>honestly refused;</HI> though in this he contradicts his Master, the <HI>Observator,</HI> who allows, <HI>that the Mer∣chants, in the Situation we were then in, with Regard to</HI> Spain, <HI>had a Right to de∣mand them;</HI> which cannot, I think, be just∣ly said of <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Pyrates.</HI></P>
<P>HE discovers the same Ignorance, when he reasons that <HI>Letters of Reprisal</HI> were
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
never granted but in Cases of <HI>open War,</HI> which he presently after <HI>contradicts</HI> himself, by saying, that they are <HI>very seldom, if ever granted, till</HI> War <HI>is declared;</HI> nay, he tells us, that this did not proceed from the <HI>Merchants being refused,</HI> but from their <HI>not finding their Account in them.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I assert, that <HI>Letters of Reprisal</HI> have been often granted in <HI>peaceable Times,</HI> and with very <HI>good Effect;</HI> of which I could produce several Instances out of our own History, and those of other Nations; but the Thing is too well known to take any Pains to falsify the Assertions of such a <HI>Writer.</HI></P>
<P>IN another Place, he asks these wise Questions; <HI>Was ever such a Thing desired? Private Ships of War to protect Trade! Was it ever known that Merchants fitted out their</HI> own Convoys? and immediately <HI>answers himself,</HI> in the same <HI>inconsistent Manner,</HI> that <HI>they have very</HI> rarely <HI>been employed as Convoys, except on very ex∣traordinary Occasions.</HI> Who ever said, or thought that they were employed on <HI>ordi∣nary Occasions?</HI> and if they have been some Times made use of, however <HI>rarely</HI> upon <HI>extraordinary Occasions,</HI> why does he ask whether such a Thing <HI>was ever known?</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
I will give him one Instance, and that shall be in the Island of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> which hath been forced to Tax themselves upwards of Six thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> to keep two Vessels cruising round the Island, in or∣der to prevent the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in peaceable Times, from stealing their <HI>Negroes,</HI> and committing other Enormities on their E∣states; as well as for convoying their <HI>un∣disputed Home Trade.</HI> — But such <HI>In∣consistencies</HI> and <HI>Contradictions</HI> are too com∣mon in the Writers on <HI>this Side,</HI> to cause any Astonishment!</P>
<P>IT is very observable, that the Gentle∣men of <HI>Jamaica</HI> have been represented in the same <HI>infamous Light</HI> by several <HI>late Writers,</HI> as well as <HI>this;</HI> particularly by the <HI>South-Sea Company's Factor,</HI> and late <HI>Plenipotentiary at</HI> Soissons. What they have done to deserve so much <HI>Calumny</HI> and <HI>Ill-Treatment</HI> I cannot say; but however <HI>neglected, despised</HI> and <HI>insulted</HI> this <HI>Island</HI> may be, I could almost venture to promise, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> would readily accept of it as an <HI>Equivalent</HI> for his present Claim and Pretensions to <HI>Gibraltar</HI> itself; for I think I could prove, that if any Place can be of greater <HI>Importance</HI> to the <HI>British Commerce</HI> than <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> it is the Island of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> and I am sure I could demon∣strate
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
that it is of ten Times the Consequence to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>THE Advantages of <HI>this Island</HI> to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> have been often set forth; but as they seem to be always industriously forgot∣ten, as soon as mentioned, I will conclude with recapitulating a few of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT employs many Thousands of <HI>poor People</HI> and <HI>ruined Families,</HI> who cannot provide for themselves, and are obliged by Misfortunes to forsake their native Country.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT takes off the several <HI>Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in which almost the <HI>whole Produce</HI> of this Island is vested.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT does not only consume our <HI>Manu∣factures</HI> it self, but vends vast Quantities of them to its Neighbours, particularly of the <HI>Staple Commodities.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. IT furnishes us with great Part of our <HI>Silver Bullion,</HI> which hath been so scarce, ever since <HI>this Island</HI> hath been in a <HI>declining Condition.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. IT pays vast Duties to the Crown, not only for <HI>those Commodities,</HI> which it produces itself, but for <HI>others,</HI> which it <HI>im∣ports</HI> into <HI>Great Britain.</HI> — I am told, that
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
<HI>Rum,</HI> for Instance, pays <HI>Four Shillings Duty,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> for what is worth but <HI>Thirteen-pence Sterling</HI> upon the Island.</P>
<P N="6">6. IT is of very great Use to our <HI>Nor∣thern Colonies,</HI> the greatest Part of whose Produce is vended in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the <HI>other Plantations;</HI> so that the Inhabitants of <HI>those Colonies</HI> are, in a great Measure, supported, and the <HI>Duties,</HI> which they pay to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> are chiefly owing to <HI>these Plantations.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. IT is so conveniently situated by Na∣ture, that no Place in the <HI>Spanish West-In∣dies</HI> is so commodious, in Case of War, either to protect our <HI>own Trade,</HI> or to an∣noy our <HI>Enemies,</HI> by lying in the middle of them. We have no other Place near to keep a Fleet of Ships in <HI>Harbour,</HI> or to <HI>refit</HI> and <HI>victual</HI> them upon Occasion. What could our late Squadron, at the <HI>Bastimentos,</HI> have done without <HI>Jamaica?</HI> And we may judge, even from what <HI>they did,</HI> what <HI>might be done</HI> by the Assistance of <HI>this Island.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are several other <HI>Advantages</HI> and <HI>Benefits,</HI> attending the happy Situation of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which it is not proper to enu∣merate in this Place, or these <HI>scandalous Calumniators</HI> should be more particularly answered. — I am indeed almost ashamed
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
of having taken so much Notice of them; and nothing but a Point of such a tender Nature as <HI>Trade,</HI> and the Cause of our <HI>suf∣fering insulted Merchants</HI> should have made me submit to so mean an Employ∣ment.</P>
<P>THEIR <HI>Case</HI> is now coming before the <HI>Parliament;</HI> and as I hope they will be able to prove themselves an <HI>honest, industri∣ous</HI> and <HI>valuable Body of Men,</HI> who desire only the free Enjoyment of their <HI>own Pro∣perty</HI> and <HI>Commerce,</HI> not any Protection for <HI>Pyracy</HI> and <HI>Rapine;</HI> so we can make no Doubt that they will receive all the Re∣paration for their <HI>past Losses,</HI> and all the Security for their <HI>future Trade,</HI> which the <HI>Legislature,</HI> in Conjunction with his <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI> (the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Protector</HI> of all his People) have it in their Power to give them.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I promised to conclude this Essay with a <HI>true List</HI> of the <HI>Spanish Cap∣tures;</HI> but the Accounts are so <HI>vari∣ous</HI> and <HI>confused,</HI> that it requires more Time than I apprehended, to adjust
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
them with that <HI>Exactness,</HI> which I proposed to my self. I must therefore desire my Readers to excuse it at pre∣sent; and I should be highly obliged to the <HI>Gentlemen concern'd,</HI> if they would give me their Assistance in it, by sending me an impartial Account of <HI>these Captures</HI> on a <HI>lawful Trade,</HI> as far as they come within their Know∣ledge. Those Gentlemen, who will be so kind as to favour me, on this Oc∣casion, are desired to specify the <HI>Names</HI> and <HI>Cargoes</HI> of the Ships taken, as well as the <HI>Places,</HI> from whence they were <HI>fitted out,</HI> to which they were <HI>bound,</HI> and <HI>where</HI> they were taken. In the mean Time I will make it my Business to examine and compare <HI>those Accounts,</HI> which have been already published.</P>
