<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>THE parliament, by which young Edward had been raised to the throne during the life of his father, appointed twelve persons as his privy council, to direct the affairs of the realm; and Henry earl of Lancaster being restored to the dignity of high steward of England, was entrusted with the guardianship of the young prince. The sentences denounced against
<PB N="3" REF="50"/>
Roger de Mortimer were repealed, on pretence of his having been condemned without a trial; and he was restored to his lands and honours, to which were now added the estates of the earls of Arundel and Winton, in North Wales. Edmund earl of Kent received a grant of some lands and castles; John de Hainault was gratified with a considerable pension; and the parliament voted to the queen the sum of twenty thousand pounds to pay her debts; the same sum as a yearly jointure, together with all the treasure of the two D'Espensers, the earl of Arundel, and Robert de Baloch, the chancellor. As the city of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale. Rymer.</NOTE> London had been so zealous in effecting the revolution, the citizens were not only pardoned for all the rob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eries, murders, and misdemeanors they had committed since the day of the queen's landing, but they were recompens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for their services, with a charter confirmed in parliament, exempting them from pryses, eyres of justices sitting in the Tower, talliages, and the seizure of their liberties for the personal transgressions of their magistrates. They were indulged with a grant of the borough of Southwark, and all the goods of felons adjudged within the liberties of the city. They were invested with the privilege of being assessed in common with the freeholders of the counties; and not like other cities and boroughs; they were discharged from all obli∣gations to serve in war without the city; and their mayor was ranked as one of the justices, in every commission for the goal delivery of Newgate. Immedi∣ately<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. W. Cont.</NOTE> after the coronation, all the French subjects, who had been apprehended in England, were released; and as Charles the French king had begun the war solely with a view to favour the designs of his sister, that purpose being now fully answered, hostilities ceased in Guienne, and a peace was concluded without any difficulty. The Scots, who had no connexion either with Isabel or Edward, resolved to take the advantage of the troubles that distracted Eng∣land; and without regarding the truce, attempted to surprize the castle of Norham, where, however, their endeavours miscarried, through the vigilance of Sir Robert Mannours, the governor of that fortress. The council apprized of these hostilities, sent ambassadors to Robert de Brus, to complain of the in∣fractions of the truce, and treat about a final pacification. That active prince paid very little regard to their remonstrances, and plainly told them he would not let slip such a favourable opportunity of annoying the inveterate enemies of his country. He even sent asolemn defiance to the court of England, threaten∣ing an immediate invasion, which the ministry hoped to prevent by a proposal for appointing commissioners to meet on the Marches, and deliberate upon the articles of a lasting treaty. Robert assented to the proposal, but at the same time persisted in his resolution to invade the northern counties; and Thomas Randolf earl of Murray, and the lord Douglas, assembled a strong body of forces for that expedition. In order to oppose this threatened incursion, the military tenants of the crown were ordered to rendezvous at Newcastle upon Tyne, on the eighteenth day of May: the fleet of the Cinque-Ports were di∣rected to sail to the northward; commissions were issued for arraying men in London, and all the other cities of the kingdom, as well as for raising the posse of Yorkshire; and the chief command of the army was vested in the earls of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Edward, even at this early age, discovered that martial disposition, for which he was he was so renowned in the sequel. He sent John de Hainault
<PB N="4" REF="60"/>
abroad to enli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a body of foreign troops; and that nobleman joined him at York in the month of May, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith five hundr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d knights and three times the number of horsemen completely armed. These strangers were care<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d in such a m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner by the queen and her son, as arouzed the jea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousy of the English<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a quarrel breaking out between the two nations, the English archers and the Hain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulters eng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged each other with great fury, and a good many were slain on both si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oreigners, exasperated at the loss they had sustained in this encounter, sallied out from their quarters in greater number, and slew about three hundred of the archers belonging to Lincolnshire and the county of Nor∣thampton; and the English incensed in their turn at this outrage, assembled next day to the number of six thousand, determined to sacrifice the aggres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors to their revenge. It was not without great difficulty that a battle was prevented, by the interposition of the king himself, who ordered the archers to remove to other quart<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, and appointed guards for the security of the foreigners. This disturbance being quelled, Edward advanced from York to Durham, where he was joined by all his forces, and received intelligence that the Scots, to the numb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of twenty thousand, had passed the Tyne, and ravaged the eastern parts of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shopri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. He resolved to intercept them in their retreat, and for th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t pur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose divided his army, consi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting of threescore thousand men, into three bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sides an advanced guard of four thousand horse, which were pirected to clear the way and detain the enemy by skirmishing, until the army should come up and give them battle. He began his march in the middle of July, in qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of the Scottish army, which he supposed to be somewhere be∣twe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Durham and Carlisle; but after his troops had undergone abundance of fatigue in their route, through mountains, woods, and morasses, he could per∣ceive no signs of the enemy, but the smoaking ruins of villages which they had<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ch. 1327.</NOTE> set on fire. He then changed his route towards the Tyne, leaving behind all his carriages, tents, and provisions, that the troops might not be encumbered i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their march: at length they arrived at the place where the Scots had passed the river; and as it was natural to suppose they would return the same way, Edward took possession of the ground on the northern side of the Tyne, where he continued five or six days, not a little incommoded for want of cover and subsistance. The Scots, informed of his motions, recalled their pillaging p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rties, and posted themselves in an advantageous situation, where they pro∣posed to remain until they should receive more certain advice of his strength and destination. Mean while the king decamped, and marching down the river, proclaimed that whoever should discover the place where the Scots were posted, might expect the honour of knighthood, and lands to the value of one hundred pounds a year, by way of recompence. On the third day after this proclamation, he received the welcome tidings from Thomas de Rokesby, who, encouraged by the promise of honour and reward, had made excursions in the neighbourhood, and found the Scots encamped, at the distance of three miles, on the other side of the river Were, that washed the foot of an high hill on which they were very advantageously encamped. He had approached so near before he could discover them that he was taken prisoner, and owning the motive which had induced him to go thither, the Scottish general set him at liberty without ransom, desiring him to tell Edward they were ready to give him battle. The king having refreshed his army, advanced against the enemy,
<PB N="5" REF="70"/>
whom he saw already ranged in order of battle upon the declivity of the moun∣tain: but the Were was so encumbered with great stones, and the current so rapid after the late rains, that the English could not pass with any prospect of advantage; and the Scots had no intention to cross the river. Edward, impa∣tient of this obstruction, sent a herald to tell the enemy, that if they were really inclined to hazard an engagement, he would either retire at a distance and allow them to pass the Were unmolested; or if they would retire to a proper distance, he would cross that river and give them battle. The Scottish generals rejected his proposal, and gave him to understand, that in such a case they should not be so unwise as to follow an enemy's advice. Thus the two armies faced each other for three days successively; and the king, who occupied the north side of the river, resolved to starve them into a battle or surrender; for he had received intimation that all their salt and oatmeal was consumed, and they had no bread for their subsistance. This was really the case; they foresaw the in∣conveniences of their situation, and decamping at midnight marched some miles higher up the river, and took possession of another mountain flanked by a wood, near Stanhope-Park, in the bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic of Durham. The English were no sooner apprised of their retreat, than they followed them, still keeping on the north side of the river, and encamped on another mountain opposite to that which they had occupied. While they remained in this situation, the lord Douglas, with a detachment of two hundred horse, forded the river a consider∣able way above the armies, and entering the English camp in the night, pene∣trated as far as the royal tent, with a view to surprize and carry off the king: but the chaplain and chamberlain alarming the guards and foreign horse, who lay upon their arms ready for engagement, Douglas was surrounded imme∣diately, and escaped with great difficulty, by cutting his way through those who opposed his retreat. Several skirmishes happened between parties of both armies, and many feats of chivalry were performed by single champions, who were ambitious of signalizing their valour under the eyes of their commanders. At length the Scots resolved to retire to their own country; and an accident favoured their retreat. A certain knight belonging to their army, being taken prisoner and examined before Edward and his council, declared that the Scots had received orders to be ready armed at night to march under the banner of Douglas. The English concluding from the enterprizing genius of that gene∣ral, that he intended to attack them in the dark, resolved to give him a warm reception; and for that purpose the army being drawn up in order of battle, stood all night under arms. While the enemy retiring in silence under covert of the adjoining wood, and passing a large morass upon hurdles, directed their march towards Carlisle with such expedition, that they had made considerable progress before morning, when the scouts brought intelligence of their depar∣ture; and next day they returned to their own country, with all the booty they had taken. Edward was exceedingly mortified to be thus baffled in his first campaign. When he went to view the Scottish camp, he saw three hundred raw skins of cattle and deer fixed upon stakes over fires by way of kettles, in which they boiled their meat, a thousand wooden spits loaded with beef, ten thousand pair of shoes made of undressed leather, and five English prisoners with their legs broken, whom they had fastened to trees, that they might not be able to give intelligence of their retreat. The king, though piqued at his

K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghton. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> own disappointment, could not help admiring the conduct and frugality of the enemy. Their stragglers were intercepted and cut in pieces by a body of horse; then he retired to Durham, from whence he proceeded to York, where the best part of his forces were dismissed.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>It was on his return from this expedition that he heard of his father's death, which he lamented with great sincerity of affliction. A parliament had been called at Lincoln, to procure a subsidy for carrying on the Scottish war, in case the treaty should not succeed, as well as to defray the expence of the king's marriage with Philippa, daughter of William III. count of Holland and Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nault; for which the pope had just granted a dispensation, as the parties were in the third degree of consanguinity. The clergy desiring longer time to consider of the demanded supply, the session broke up without having transacted any business; and another parliament was convened at Lincoln in November, when a considerable subsidy was voted by the clergy and laity. The bishop of Lincoln had been impowered to make a contract with Philippa in verbis de praesenti; and she was conducted into England by her uncle John de Hainault, in December, with a very honourable train of attendants. As she approached London, the mayor and aldermen went forth to meet her in their formalities, expressed their regard in a present of plate; and she was received in the city by a solemn procession of the clergy. From thence she set out for York, where the king at that time resided, and where the nuptials were solemnized with great<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. West.

<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1328.</NOTE> Mean while the English and Scottish commissioners opened their con∣ferences at Newcastle; and both parties being very desirous of peace, the dis∣cussion of the articles was attended with no difficulty. Mortimer, who had nominated his own adherents as deputies on this occasion, thought he could not take a wiser step than that of securing the favour of Scotland, where he might find an asylum, in case he should be persecuted like Gaveston and D'Espenser; a misfortune he partly foresaw from the hatred of the Eng∣lish nation, which he had already incurred. On the other hand, Robert de Brus was now in the decline of life, labouring under an incurable distemper, and his only son being yet in his infancy, he gladly embraced an opportunity to leave him in peace with his neighbours; especially as the lord Douglas, the nobleman on whose valour, conduct and fidelity he chiefly depended, had by this time engaged himself by oath in an expedition against the infidels in Palestine. Tho' Robert was in a condition to demand favourable terms, he did not think proper to rest entirely on the merits of his power and character, but liberally distributed among the queen dowager, Mortimer, and some of the English deputies, part of that wealth which he had amassed in his irruptions into England. Besides, the lords Piercy, Wake, and Beaumont, who conducted the treaty, were interested in effecting an accommodation, by which they were restored to their possessions in Scotland, which had been con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscated during the war. All these circumstances concurring towards a paci∣fication, the treaty was concluded upon such conditions as Brus could never have expected from an impartial examination of the points and articles in dispute. It was stipulated, that the kingdom of Scotland should stand for ever divided from England, by the same Marches that distinguished it in the reign of Alexander III. That Edward should for himself, his heirs and
<PB N="7" REF="90"/>
successors, release Robert de Brus of all obligations, conventions and agree∣ments made with any of his predecessors, touching the subjection of that realm; and declare all charters, deeds, and instruments thereto relating, void and of no validity: That Robert de Brus should be acknowledged as the lawful monarch of that independent kingdom; and that Edward's eldest sister Jane should be married to David prince of Scotland: That Robert should pay thirty thousand marks to the king of England, as an indemni∣fication for the damage done by the Scots in their last irruption: That the subjects of both princes should be restored to the possessions which of right belonged to them in both kingdoms: That Edward should use his interest with the pope to free the king and kingdom of Scotland from the ecclesiastical censures denounced against them; and that he should deliver up to Robert the regalia of his realm, together with the original roll of homage, by which John Baliol and the freeholders of Scotland recognized the superiority of the English monarch. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>The articles of this treaty excited an universal clamour all over the kingdom; for, some of them had transpired before the parliament con∣vened to confirm the transaction. The people loudly complained, that the commissioners had betrayed the honour and interest of their country, in tamely giving up that claim, for the support of which so much blood had been shed and treasure wasted; and in consenting to a marriage between a princess of England, and the son of a man who had been treated as an outlaw and traitor to her own grandfather. A number of the prelates and nobility absented themselves from the parliament assembled at York, because they would not venture to contradict the measures of Mortimer, whose power was very for∣midable, and they were too honest to approve or countenance such a shame∣ful accommodation. Nevertheless, Edward impowered Henry de Percy and W. de Souche to swear in his name to the articles of the treaty; and the in∣strument of his renunciation of the superiority over Scotland, imports that it was executed with the consent of the prelates, lords and commons assembled in parliament. The king immediately after this transaction, sent a letter to the pope, desiring he would annull the censures which had been denounced against Robert and his dominions; the princess Jane was sent under the conduct of her mother to Berwick, where she was affianced to David de Brus, and from thence conducted into Scotland; and the roll of homage granted to Edward I. together with all the records which he had brought from that kingdom, were delivered to the Scottish agents, according to the inventory which had been taken, when they were first lodged in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte. Rymer.</NOTE> Exchequer.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>Perhaps Edward, young as he was, would not have submitted to this inglorious treaty, which precluded him from gratifying his resentment against the Scots, whom he hated, had not his attention been diverted to more aspiring views, which more effectually flattered his ambition. Charles Le Bel, king of France, dying without male issue, Mortimer and the queen persuaded Edward that he was next in succession to the crown of France, in right of his mother Isabel, sister to the late king; and he forthwith resolved to pro∣secute his claim to that monarchy. As the queen of France was pregnant at her husband's death, he could not demand the succession until it should
<PB N="$" REF="100"/>
appear whether the fruit of her womb was male or female; but, in the mean time, he sent letters to the nobility and communities of Guienne, Languedoc, and Navarre, declaring his resolution to recover the rights and inheritance of his mother; and desiring they would assist his endeavours. While a new par∣liament fat for the dispatch of business at Northampton, he granted powers of procuration to the bishops of Worcester and Lincoln, to maintain his right to the crown of France, and sent ambassadors to form a league with the duke of Brabant, and the towns and cities in Flanders which were then at actual war with Philip de Valois, whom the French first declared regent of the realm, and afterwards proclaimed king, when the widow of Charles was delivered of a daughter. This prince was certainly the true heir to the crown of France, as son of Charles count de Valois, brother to Philip the Fair. Edward, though nearer in blood to the last king, was excluded by the Salick law, which had never been infringed in the succession of the French kings; and his allegation that the force of that law was broken by his being a male, though descended from a female, contained a palpable absurdity; for she who had no right in herself, could convey none to her descendants.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding this objection, Edward was so agreeably intoxi∣cated with the prospect of uniting two mighty kingdoms in his own person, that he would not desist from his pretensions; but summoned a great council of the nobility and clergy at York, to explain his intentions and title, and obtain their approbation on this subject, as well as their sanction of the peace with Scotland. By this time Mortimer was become so disagreeable for his insolence and arbitrary measures, that the noblemen and prelates were averse to every measure he proposed; and this assembly broke up without having come to any resolution. A parliament was therefore convoked at Salisbury; and though the members were by particular writs inhibited from appearing with force or arms, on pain of forfeiture, Mortimer went thither with a strong body of adherents armed, in contempt of the prohibition. The earl of Lancaster, and other peers who were on the road to parliament, being in∣formed of this suspicious circumstance, were so alarmed, that they proceeded no farther than Winchester: and indeed their apprehensions seemed too well founded; for, while the bishops, prelates and other members assembled in parliament, were consulting about the affairs of the nation, he went with a body of armed men, and bursting open the doors, threatened them with instant death, should they presume to speak or act in any thing contrary to his inclination. Intimidated by this violent outrage, they withdrew, before any thing of moment was transacted; and the noblemen at Winchester thought it high time to retire without the reach of such an insolent tyrant, who had even pressed the king to march against them in an hostile manner. Such was the end of this session<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> during which the earldoms of Cornwal, Marche, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parl.

<P>Though a council of twelve persons had been appointed by par∣liament to advise and direct the young king at his accession to the throne, and the earl of Lancaster was entrusted with the care of his person, Mortimer wholly engrossed the administration, by virtue of the ascendancy he had gained over the queen mother and her son, who acted altogether by his direction.
<PB N="9" REF="110"/>
He distributed all offices of trust and profit among his own creatures; and squandered away his master's treasure in gratifying his own vanity, which was equal to that of Gavaston. He held tournaments with great pomp and osten∣tation; affected magnificence even superior to that of royalty itself. His insolence was such, that he treated his superiors and equals with the most pro∣voking contempt: he persecuted all those who presumed to blame his conduct or oppose his designs; he rendered the king inaccessible to all but his own friends and abettors; and prevented the earl of Lancaster himself, as well as the members of the council, from speaking to him on the affairs of the nation. This nobleman could not without indignation bear the arrogance of such an upstart, which was equally disagreeable to other peers of the realm; and now seeing the freedom of parliaments destroyed by his late outrageous behaviour at Salisbury, they began to take measures for obtaining redress in another manner; they met in private and formed a confederacy for their mutual pre∣servation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

They held conferences at London, to de∣liberate upon articles of impeachment against Mortimer; they resolved to en∣quire into the late king's death; to charge this overgrown favourite with the dissipation of the king's revenue, a treasonable correspondence with the Scots at Stanhope-park, giving up the sovereignty of Scotland, and delivering the roll of homage, subscribed by the barons and freeholders of that kingdom. They likewise determined to demand a resumption of the forfeited estates and castles granted to the queen-mother, and her minion, to the prejudice of the royal revenue, which was hardly sufficient to maintain the king's houshold in its usual spendour. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>After having consulted on these subjects at London, which favoured their designs, they held a general meeting at St. Paul's, where they engaged in an association to procure certain ordinances for the good of the kingdom; and deputed the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishop of London, and the king's two uncles, the earls of Kent and Mareschal, to sollicit the king's assent to their proposal. But these two noblemen were seduced from their party by the allurements of a court; and the two prelates endeavoured to effect a peace on the best terms they could procure for the confederates. By this time hostili∣ties were begun by Mortimer, who had raised an army, surprized Leicester, and ravaged the lands belonging to the earl of Lancaster; and that nobleman had assembled a body of forces with which he advanced as far as Bedford, against the aggressor. The court dreaded an insurrection of the commons in favour of Lancaster, who had acquired great popularity; and the Londoners having already espoused his cause, those who governed the king did not th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk proper to run the risk of a rebellion.

<PB N="10" REF="120"/>
to postpone. He had been summoned by Philip de Valois the French king, to do homage for the dominions he held of the crown of France; but as he did not chuse to appear in a state of humiliation before a prince whose competi∣tor he was for the kingdom he possessed, he sent over ambassadors to sollicit delays, on various pretences; yet Philip insisting upon his personal submission, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed from Dover in May, and did homage to the French king at Amiens, tho' not before he had made a formal protest in his own council, that he sub∣mitted to this ceremony upon compulsion, for fear of losing his dominions on the continent, and in order to prevent other calamities with which his refusal might be artended; but, that he did not by this act of homage intend to re∣nounce his right to the crown of France, or to derogate from his claim, even though he should be obliged to sign an instrument to that effect. Edward was received at the court of France with great magnificence, and a cordiality of friendship, which they proposed to cement by a marriage between Philip's son John, and Edward's sister Eleonora: a formal treaty was brought upon<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> the carpet for this purpose, but never took effect. The king returned to England in June, about two days after the decease of Robert de Brus, who died of a leprosy, after a reign of twenty years, in which he had distinguished himself above all the princes of his time, for valour, fortitude, and wisdom.</P>

<P>Mortimer having conceived an implacable enmity against the earl of Kent, because he openly opposed the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pernicious measures, and ambitious de∣signs, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e daily hatched or put in execution, resolved to remove this ob∣stacle out of the way of his arbitrary career, and laid a successful snare for his destruction. He employed emissaries all over the kingdom, to diffuse a re∣port that Edward of Caernarvon was still alive in Corte-castle, though visible to none but by particular licence. He knew the earl of Kent had always re∣tained a warm affection for that unfortunate brother, although he joined the queen against the D'Espensers, without suspecting that her design was to de∣throne her h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sband; and therefore he did not doubt that the earl would interest himself in behalf of the distressed monarch, could he once be persuaded that Edward was actually alive. Such an uncommon circumstance could not fail of becoming the general topic of discourse; and Kent did not hear the story without emotion. He questioned Mautravers, and Sir John Deverel, gover∣nor of Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-castle; and they being tutored for the purpose, confirmed the truth of the report, which they pretended to communicate through friendship and confidence. Other persons of co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sideration joined them in this infamo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> deceit, and even proposed mea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures for setting the imprisoned king at liberty. Kent being thus deluded and trepanned, wrote a letter to his brother, assuring him he would use his utmost end<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avours to procure his enlargement; and that the chief noblemen of the realm were resolved to employ their power and influ∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce for restoring him to the dignity of which he had been so unjustly de∣prived. Deverel, who undertook to deliver this letter to Edward II. carried it immediately to Mortimer, who received it with joy, as the infallible means of the earl's destruction. A parliament was summoned to meet in March at Winchester; and there he proposed to make use of this advantage he had gained over his adversary. As he had been long accustomed to overawe and intimidate parliaments, few or none attended at this assembly but his own

B.</NOTE> He imparted Kent's letter to the king, with such comments and exag∣gerations, as prevailed upon Edward to write to that nobleman, desiring his<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Some of Mortimer's adherents were sent to examine him in prison; and they made false reports, and produced forged confessio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, calcu∣lated for exasperating Edward against his uncle. His letter to Edward of caernarvon being read in parliament, he was convicted of treason, and con∣demned to lose his head. Mortimer, and the queen, extorted a warrant from Edward, directed to the bailiffs of Winchester, commanding them to execute the sentence without delay: but they could find no person who would under∣take the office of executioner, until a felon was brought from the Marshalsea, who performed the task, on condition of receiving a free pardon for the crimes he had committed. The king expressed great concern for his uncle's death, and caused <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is body to be interred in the dominican convent at Winchester; and as that nobleman was exceedingly beloved by the people, his fare produced an universal clamour through the whole nation. Mortimer, who was cursed as the cause of his death, as well as of all the grievances of the nation, endeavoured to amuse the resentment of the people, by diffusing the report of a pretended conspiracy, to be supported by foreigners. The archbishop of York the bishop of London, and several other prelates and noblemen were prosecuted for treasonable designs, because they had expressed some satisfaction when they heard of the late king's being alive: the earl of Lancaster was arrested on suspicion; several dominican and carmelite friars were imprisoned and sent into exile; and proclamations were published in every county, commanding the sheriffs to take into custody all those who should presume to say that Ed∣ward II. was alive. These measures answered his purpose so far as to intimi∣date his adversaries, and gratify his avarice with the forfei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed estates, fines, and ransoms; but at the same time they increased that tide of ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red and revenge, which tho' pent up for a season, broke down all its mounds in the sequel, and bursting with double violence, overwhelmed him with destruction.

<P>By this time hostilities had commenced on the frontiers of Guienne, between the French and English.

The archbishop of Canterbury was directed to convoke a synod at Lambeth, that his clergy might grant a subsidy towards the expence of this expedition: but they rejected the proposal, alledging they were already overburthened by the pope, who had lately taxed them at a tenth of their benefices, and all the profits of vacancies, during the term of four years, to be equally divided between his holiness and Edward.

His disgust was no sooner known, than all those who had access to his majesty, vied with each other in explaining the particulars of his vicious life, and arbitrary pro∣ceedings. They expatiated upon the murder of the late king, and the death of the earl of Kent, as the partial execution of a scheme he had formed to destroy the whole royal family; and Edward gave ear to these suggestions. The earl of Marche had so much engrossed the royal authority, and was so firmly established in the administration, that the king foresaw it would be altogether impracticable to assume the reins of government, until this usurp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> should be disgraced and ruined; though this would be no easy task, consider∣ing that the whole power of the kingdom was in his hands; that he was always upon his guard, surrounded by a body of knights, and other adherents, in arms; and that he constantly employed a number of spies to watch the con∣duct of his sovereign. Notwithstanding these difficulties, Edward doomed him to destruction, and admitted William Lord Montacute into his confi∣dence. By means of this nobleman he imparted his design to others of the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> nobility, and they resolved to seize the person of Mortimer, during the session of parliament, which was summoned to meet about Michaelmas, at Not∣tingham.</P>

<P>Edward intended to secure the castle of that city; but the queen and Mortimer, who suspected his design, anticipated his purpose, by going th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther before him, and taking up their quarters in it with all their retinue; so that when the king arrived, there was no room for his attendants, though he himself was admitted, with three or four domestics. Mortimer had re∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved some intimation of the plot that was formed against him, which how∣ever he purposed to counter-work, by apprehending and confining in this fortress all those of the nobility whom he considered as his enemies. Mean while they were lodged about a mile from the town, where they had the op∣portunity of consulting about the execution of their scheme, without being ob∣served by Mortimer; t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough it was judged impracticable at that time, with∣out the conc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrence of Sir William Eland, governor of the castle. He was sounded on the subject by the lord Montacute, and found zealous for the king's service; but he could not admit them into the fortress, because the qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n had ordered the locks to be altered, and the keys were carried every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght into her apartment. However, he suggested another expedient which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>swered their expectation. On the western side of the castle there was a ne∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected caver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the mouth of a subterranean passage, which communicated
<PB N="13" REF="150"/>
with the castle; and through this he undertook to conduct them to the apart∣ment of the earl of Marche. The scheme was approved, and measures were immediately concerted for its execution. The lords Montacute, Molins, Uf∣ford, Stafford, and Clinton, with Sir John Nevil of Hornby, Sir Humphry, Sir Edward, and Sir William de Bohun, were the chiefs of this enterprize. These, and Sir William Eland, took horse and quitted Nottingham in the afternoon; so that Mortimer imagined they had fled, to avoid his resentment; but they returned at midnight, and entering the dark passage, which to this day is known by the name of Mortimer's hole, they arrived, under the con∣duct of Eland, in the chief tower of the castle: from thence they proceeded softly to the chamber adjoining to the queen's apartment, where they found Mortimer, with the bishop of Lincoln, and others of his party, in close con∣sultation, and took him prisoner, after having slain Sir Hugh de Turpliton, and Richard de Monmouth, who drew their swords in his defence. The queen hearing the noise, and guessing the design of their coming, called aloud in the French language, to her son, who she supposed to be at the head of the party, Fair son! fair son! have pity on the accomplished Mortimer. No answer being made to this exclamation, she started from bed, and rushing among the conspirators, earnestly begged they would do no injury to his person; for he was a worthy knight, her dear friend and well-beloved cousin. This exploit was performed with so little noise, that the people in the town knew nothing of what was transacted in the castle; and next morning the royalists seized two of Mortimer's sons, and several adherents, who lodged without the walls of the castle. Among these were Oliver de Ingham, and Simon de Be∣reford, his chief counsellors and partisans. All the prisoners were sent to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> Tower of London; and the king that same day published a proclamation, signifying that he had now taken the government into his own hands, and would redress the grievances of the people. Then he repaired to Leicester, where he issued out writs for a new parliament at Westminster; to which all persons aggrieved by the late administration were invited to explain their wrongs, that they might obtain satisfaction. At this assembly, held in No∣vember, articles of impeachment were exhibited against Roger de Mortimer, and his accomplices. He was accused of setting the queen-mother at vari∣ance with her husband; of procuring exorbitant grants which impaired the crown revenue; of embezzling the king's jewels and treasure; of conspiring to destroy his majesty's best friends; of obtaining pardon for two hundred Irish∣men, who had murdered the king's liege subjects; of extorting grants of sol∣diers from the knights of shires, and laying arbitrary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines upon the military tenants of the crown, for dispensing with their serving in the war of Guienne; of assuming the regal power, and engrossing the administration; of insulting the prelates assembled in the parliament at Salisbury; of persuading the king to march in an hostile manner against the earl of Lancaster, and the other peers who had tarried at Winchester; of imposing excessive fines on that nobleman, and others, contrary to the capitulation of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dford; of seizing the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands of the barons, and driving them out of the nation; of treacherously contriving the death of the earl of Kent; of removing the late king from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to Berkeley-castle, where he was inhum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my murdered by h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> These facts were deemed so notorious, that without examinin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evidence, or

allowing him to make his defence, he was voted guilty of high treason, and condemned to be drawn, hanged and quartered; a sentence which was exe∣cuted at a place called the Elmes, about a mile from London, where his body<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l. 4 Ld.

Simon de Bereford met with the same fate; and the like sentence was denounced against Mautravers, Deverel, Gournay, Ogle, and Bayons, who had been concerned in the murder of the late king. These, however, had escaped beyond sea; and all that the par∣liament could do was to offer rewards for taking and bringing them to justice. Thomas lord Berkeley was tried by a jury of knights, for being accessary to the regicide which was perpetrated in his castle; but he was honourably ac∣quitted; though he was committed to the custody of Ralph Nevil, steward of the houshold, until he should answer in the next parliament for the in∣fidelity of his servants who had been accomplices in the murder. The lord Montacute, and the rest who had been instrumental in seizing Mortimer, were recompensed with lands for their services, and pardoned for the death of Turpliton and Monmouth; the fines and confiscations incurred by the barons who had apeared in arms with the earl of Lancaster, at Bedford, were now remitted; the attainder of the earl of Kent was reversed, and his son retrieved the estate and dignity; and Richard earl of Arundel was restored to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the honour and possessions of his father. All sheriffs appointed by Mortimer's influence, were removed; all grants of lands, castles, and wardships, since the king's accession, were resumed; queen Isabel was stripped of her pos∣sessions, and reduced to an annuity of four thousand pounds; and some wholesome regulations were made for the preservation of the peace, the management of the revenue, and the exercise of the government in Ireland.</P>

The count of Alençon had invaded Guienne, and taken Xaintes; and though matters had been in some measure compromised, so as to put a stop to hostilities<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the war was now ready to break out with greater fury. As various disputes subsisted between Edward and Philip de Valois, which the plenipotentiaries of the two crowns could not de∣termine, the king of England imagined he should be able to remove all obstructions to a solid peace, by a personal interview with Philip; and resolved to cross the sea, on pretence of performing a vow of pilgrimage which he had made in some dangerous emergency, leaving his brother John of Eltham guardian of the realm. He took shipping at Dover, in April, with a very small retinue; and in a few days settled the controverted points in an amicable manner with the king of France. Edward acknowledged that liege homage was due for Guienne; he agreed to pay the residue of the money stipulated in the treaty with Charles Le Bel, as due to that prince, for costs in the se∣questration of Guienne. Philip granted a remission to the officers of the dutchy, who by that treaty were banished their country; he restored the town and castle of Xaintes, paid a sum of money in lieu of damages; and a treaty wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brought upon the carpet for a match between Philip's daughter<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.</NOTE> Jane, and the young prince of England.</P>

<P>The king returning to England, before the end of the month, summoned a parliament to meet in September, at Westminster, in order to consult them about a design which he had formed to visit Ireland, and reduce
<PB N="15" REF="170"/>
the rebels of that country. But he was advised to send over some able officer, with troops sufficient to re-establish the peace of that kingdom, and defer going thither in person until all the disturbances of England should be sup∣pressed. Separate bands of free-booters, consisting of dissolute people and outlaws, habituated to rapine during the late troubles, had fixed their haunts and habitations in different forests, from whence they made occasional ex∣cursions, to rob travellers and lay the subjects under contribution. They were so bold and numerous as to set the civil power at defiance; and being protected by some of the nobility, became so insolent as to seize the judges on the circuit, and oblige them to pay ransom for their lives and liberty. With a view to deliver the kingdom from this annoyance, the parliament prohibited justs and tournaments, which served as occasions of rendezvous to armed people. The lords were commanded to withdraw their countenance and pro∣tection from such lawless robbers and delinquents, against whom the king marched in person, with such success, that after having routed them in several engagements, he either killed, imprisoned, or expelled every individual of their gangs; so that the nation was free from such nusances during the remaining part of his reign. As no other provision was made in the treaty with France for restitution of the Agenois, but that of referring the dispute to the decision of eight French peers, to be named by the king of England, Edward now resolved to recover that country, even though they should decide against his pretensions: that he might be prepared for the execution of his purpose, he contracted an alliance with the count of Gueldres, on whom he bestowed his sister Eleanor in marriage; and received a large subsidy from the clergy and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Claus. 6.

<P>The king of France being declared generalissimo of a crusade, by the pope, sollicited the assistance of the European princes, and in particular pressed Edward to engage in the expedition; a proposal which the parliament advised him to decline, unless Philip would defer his departure until the affairs of Ireland should be settled, and England secured against all danger from Scotland, which now seemed to be on the eve of a surprizing revo∣lution. A bloody war had broke out in Ireland between the English govern∣ment and the natives; and in another parliament which met in September, the prelates and nobility having taken the state of that kingdom into con∣sideration, agreed that considerable succours of men and money should be sent over to strengthen the hands of the administration: a subsidy was granted for that purpose; but they opposed the king's going thither in person, because his presence was absolutely necessary to attend to the commotions in Scotland. Though it had been stipulated in the treaty with Robert de<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> Brus, that the English barons should be restored to the estates they had for∣merly possessed in Scotland, several barons, namely, Henry lord Beaumont earl of Buchan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> David de Strathbolgy earl of Athol, Gilbert Umf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eville earl of Angus, the lords Wake, Fitzwaren, Stafford, Ferrers, Mowbray, Talbot, sir Roger Swinnerton, and others, were still debarred of the benefit of this article. Edward had interposed with the Scottish regency in behalf of these<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1332.</NOTE> noblemen, and was amused with evasive answers; from which he concluded that the Scots were resolved to keep the lands they had usurped. He had besides<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> another cause of complaint against them; they had seized the town

The king was not sorry for their fur∣nishing him with an handle to renounce the treaty, which he looked upon as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>glor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous, and highly prejudic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l to his right of superiority over Scotland, which he was determined one day to revive: but as he had promised upon bond to the pope, that he would observe the peace for the term of four years at least, he would not take any step by which he might run the risque of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>curring the penalty of the obligation. The noblemen, however, whose in∣terest was more immediately concerned, resolved to exert themselves for the recovery of their inheritances by force of arms; and without all doubt, they acted by the connivance of Edward. They had recourse to Edward, the son of John Baliol, who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at his father's death, had been left a minor, and prisoner in England. He was a prince of remarkable bravery, and a most enterprizing genius; and him they encouraged to make an effort for the recovery of his father's crown. The conjuncture was favourable, on account of the nonage of David de Brus, the death of James lord Douglas, and the age and infir∣mities of Thomas Randolph, the guardian of the realm; and they promised to raise a considerable body of forces to maintain his pretensions. Edward gladly embraced the proposal, and they began forthwith to prepare for the expedition. Though the king of England, in order to keep measures with his holiness, published proclamations for keeping the peace between the two kingdoms, and refused them a passage by land through his territories; they persisted in their operations with unremitting assiduity, and embarking their forces at Raven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pur in Yorkshire, landed in the beginning of August at Kinghorn. Sir Alexander Seton, at the head of the Fife militia, endeavoured to oppose their landing; but was routed and slain, with nine hundred of his followers. Baliol advancing to Dumfer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling, found a magazine of arms, which were given to those who joined his banner in Scotland. Then he pro∣ceeded towards Gladsmuir, where Donald earl of Marre, the new guardian, was encamped, at the head of a numerous army, while an advanced body had posted themselves on the other side of the river, to dispute the passage of the English. Confiding in their numbers, and the depth of the river, they lay in a very careless manner, almost wholly unguarded; and this circumstance be∣ing communicated to Bal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> by one of his friends in the Scottish army, who at the same time discovered a ford at a place called Duplin, he passed it in the night with all his forces, and fell upon the enemy, who were immediately routed and slain in great numbers. The earl of Marre, who lay with the main body at the distance of some miles from the scene of this action, pro∣posed to starve out the English without righting; but, Robert earl of Carrick, natural son of the late Robert <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Brus treating this proposal as the effect of cowardice, a dispute arose, in the course of which those ferocious chiefs chal∣lenged each other to begin the battle without delay; and they forthwith <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against Baliol with the utmost precipitation, while their followers ran <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in disord <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Such was the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of this attack, that when they arrived in a narrow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> through which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were obliged to pass, men and horses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over one another; and they lay in heaps, an easy prey to the English, who made a terrible slaughter The two impetuous leaders were slain, together with A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an earl of Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th, Campbell the Scottish earl of

Athol; the lords Neil, and Alexander de Brus, Robert lord Keith, William lord Hay, constable of Scotland; Alexander lord Lindsay, a great number of knights and gentlemen, and about thirteen thousand soldiers; whereas the loss of the English did not amount to forty men. After this signal victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun. Barnes.</NOTE> Baliol entered Perth without opposition; and finding it well supplied with pro∣visions, employed his forces in putting the place in a posture of defence. This was a very necessary precaution; for the fortifications were scarce re∣paired when he found himself besieged by Patrick earl of Dunbar, and Archi∣bald Douglas, who had raised a considerable army of hardy troops on the border; and, as they could not come up in time to prevent the disaster of Gladsmuir, now resolved to block up the victor, so as reduce him by famine. They in a great measure depended upon John Crabbe, a Flemish sailor, whom they had enlisted in their service. He then lay with ten well armed ships in the harbour of Berwick; and they sent him orders to destroy the English squa∣dron which was stationed at the mouth of the Tay, for the convenience of supplying Baliol and his followers. He accordingly attacked them with great fury; but met with such a warm reception, that all his own vessels were either burnt or taken; and the Scottish generals finding themselves disappointed in that quarter, as well as in want of provisions, while Baliol was furnished by sea, abandoned their enterprize, and dismissed their forces. The Scots in ge∣neral, astonished at the rapidity of Baliol's success, and intimidated by the loss they had sustained, laid aside all thoughts of further opposition; and he was crowned king of Scotland at Scone, in the month of September. Very few noblemen of the country assisted at this ceremony: but the earl of Marche, and Archibald Douglas, with those of the Brussian interest, proposed a truce till Candlemas; to which he assented, that he might have time to hold a par∣liament for settling the affairs of the kingdom. In this interval young Da∣vid de Brus, with Jane, sister of the king of England, the princess to whom he had been affianced, was sent over to France, where Philip received them<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.

<P>Such was the situation of affairs in Scotland, when king Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1333.</NOTE> summoned a parliament to meet at York, in order to consult his prelates and nobility, about the regulation of his conduct, touching this unexpected revo∣lution. This assembly being very thin, it was adjourned till January, when the members having deliberated upon the subject, advised his majesty to con∣sult the opinions of the pope and the king of France, who had already sollicited his interposition in behalf of David, to whom his own sister was betrothed. They at the same time exhorted him to appoint proper guardians of the Marches; and keep none but trusty and wise counsellors about his person. One would be apt to think, from the nature of their advice, that they disap∣proved of a war with Scotland, as they did not mention the circumstance of his claim to the superiority of that kingdom, which he desired them particu∣larly to consider. Perhaps, indeed, they thought it unnecessary to signify their opinions on that subject, as Edward had already taken his resolution. Before the meeting of this session he had an interview at Roxburgh with Ba∣liol, who did liege homage for the kingdom of Scotland; obliged himself to assign the town, castle, and shire of Berwick, in part of two thousand pounds to be yearly paid to the king of England; to assist him in his wars with a cer∣tain

The Brussian party, without pay∣ing any regard to the truce, resolved to snatch this opportunity of seizing him and his attendants; and executed the scheme with such circumspection and dis∣patch. that Edward had scarce time to mount a horse without bridle or saddle, on which he escaped with great difficulty to Carlisle; while his followers fell into the hands of the enemy, and his own brother Henry lost his life, after having performed miracles of valour in attempting to effect a retreat. The Scots under Sir W. Douglas, flushed with their success, made incursions into Cumberland, which they ravaged without scruple; and this infraction of the peace afforded the king of England a plausible pretence to renounce the treaty, and declare for Baliol. Hostilities were now committed on both sides; and several skirmishes fought on the border. Sir W. Douglas was defeated and taken by Sir Anthony Lucy; and Andrew Murray, in fighting with Baliol at Roxburgh, advanced so far before his followers, that his communication was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> cut off, and he was carried into the castle.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Edward king of England having now no longer any reason to conceal his designs, complained to the courts of France, Rome, and Flanders, of the hostilities which the Scots had committed; sent ambassadors to demand homage of David de Brus: and this being peremptorily refused, denounced war against him as a contumacious vassal. He sent for reinforcements to Aquitain and Ireland; and appointed the rendezvous of his army at New∣castle upon Tyne, from whence he marched, in the beginning of May, to be∣siege Berwick, which he invested immediately, fixing his head-quarters at Tweedemouth. The Scots had supplied this frontier with a strong garrison, under two of their bravest commanders, namely Sir William de Keith, go∣vernor of the town, and Patrick Dunbar earl of Marche, guardian of the castle. These leaders made such a gallant defence, ruining the works of the besiegers in repeated sallies, that Edward, after having made several unsuc∣cessful attacks, resolved to change the siege into a kind of blockade by sea and land, in order to reduce them by famine; and in the mean time to pene∣trate with part of his army into the heart of Scotland, in hope of bringing the guardian to a decisive battle. He accordingly left the conduct of the siege to Baliol, and entering that country, advanced as far as Edinburgh, without any other opposition than that of being incommoded in his march by the detach∣ments of Archibald Douglas, now guardian of the realm, who wisely avoided a general engagement. After a tedious and fruitless progress through a bar∣ren country, from which the natives had conveyed their most valuable effects to inaccessible fastnesses, he returned to Berwick, the siege of which he now r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sumed with redoubled vigour; nor could he be diverted from his purpose, though Douglas marched into England, and even invested the castle of Ban∣borough, in which the queen resided. Edward knew the place was well forti∣fied,
<PB N="19" REF="210"/>
and the Scot unprovided with implements for a siege; he therefore con∣sidered the attempt as an artifice to draw him from Berwick, which he was re∣solved to reduce at all events. The Scots continued to make an obstinate de∣fence, until their fortifications were almost intirely demolished; and then they demanded a truce of five days, on condition of surrendering the place if it should not be relieved before the expiration of that term. Sir William de Keith was furnished with a safe-conduct, by virtue of which he repaired to Ban∣borough, at that time beleaguered by Douglas, whom he persuaded to march to the relief of the place: but the truce expiring before he could approach the English army, Edward demanded the immediate surrender of the town and castle; and Seton, the deputy governor, starting some difficulties, he ordered that officer's two sons, whom he received as hostages, to be hang'd before the walls, in sight of their father. This at least is the account given by the Scottish writers, which however is denied by all the English historians, who affirm that the Scottish army came in sight before the truce was expired; and therefore Edward could have no pretence for demanding a surrender. Douglas, with a numerous army, arrived at Bothville, near Halidowne hill, on Mon∣day the nineteenth day of July, and drew up his forces in four divisions, com∣manded by the principal nobility of Scotland. The English were posted upon the hill, drawn up also in four battalions, flanked with archers, for which the kingdom was always famous. In this situation did Edward wait the at∣tack of the enemy, who began to ascend the hill with great impetuosity about the hour of vespers. But they met with such a reception as in a little time checked their career. They were soon out of breath, in consequence of run∣ning up the hill in armour; they were terribly galled by the arrows of the English; they suffered severely from the huge stones that were rolled down upon them incessantly; and their general being killed by a spear, they fell into disorder and dejection. Edward perceiving them fatigued, broken, and dis∣pirited, ordered John lord Darcy to attack them in flank, with a body of light armed foot from Ireland; while he himself fell in among them, at the head of a choice brigade of men at arms, and archers on horseback. The men at arms in the Scottish army had dismounted to begin the attack; and now, when they might have made some defence on horseback, they found them∣selves deprived of their horses, by the lacquies who had fled with them from the field of battle. All resistance was now at an end; the enemy were sur∣rounded, and an horrible carnage ensued. Twenty thousand Scots fell in the battle, and in the pursuit; and almost the whole nobility of the kingdom were either killed or taken. This great victory was obtained at the expence of one<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford. Knyghton. Baines.</NOTE> knight, one esquire, and thirteen foot soldiers, who lost their lives; and the town and castle of Berwick surrendered next morning.</P>

<P>The king punctually performed the articles of the capitulation; granted time for the Scottish inhabitants to remove their effects, and permitted those to stay who were disposed to take the oaths to the English government. Pa∣trick Dunbar earl of Marche entered into his service; and, in conjunction with the lord Henry de Percy, was entrusted with the guard of Lothian and Gal∣loway. Edward having annexed Berwick to the crown of England for ever, and given orders for repairing the fortifications, left six and twenty thousand men with Baliol, to assist him in the reduction of Scotland; and disbanding the rest of his army, returned to the southern parts of his dominions. Scot∣land
<PB N="20" REF="220"/>
was by this time so weakened and discouraged by the loss of so many battles, and all the flower of the nobility, that Baliol could expect to meet with very little opposition. He accordingly over-ran the whole country with∣out resistance, and reduced all the castles except those of Dunbritton, Urqu∣hart, and two or three others that were deemed impregnable. He then sum∣moned a parliament to meet at Edinburgh, at which seven bishops, together with the English earls of Buchan, Athole, and Mar, the earl of Marche, Sir William de Keith, and Sir Alexander Seton assisted. And here the charters of homage to the king of England, subscribed by Baliol, were solemnly con∣firmed; David earl of Athol, the lords Beaumont and Talbot, were put in possession of the estates to which they laid claim in Scotland; Henry de Percy was gratified for his services with the Pele of Lochmaban, Annandale, and Moffetdale, which belonged to the earl of Murray; and grants were made to several other English gentlemen, at the expence of the Scottish proprietors. All the statutes and ordinances passed in the reigns of Robert and David de Brus, were repealed; and all the lands they had granted away reclaimed and restored to the former possessors. These measures, howsoever just, were extremely im∣politic; inasmuch as all the people thus deprived of their possessions, were ren∣dered desperate, and became the implacable enemies of Baliol; and the Scots in general, who were violently interested in the glory of their nation, looked with contempt and detestation upon a prince who had so shamefully given up that independence which had cost them so much blood to maintain. They con∣sidered Baliol as an alien, and the son of him who first acknowledged himself the vassal of the first Edward; and their affection glowed in favour of the son of their great restorer. The resentment of his old enemies was not so prejudicial his interest as the alienation of his friends. He was so imprudent as to dis∣oblige the lord Beaumont, who had been the first author and chief support of his enterprize, and laid him under a variety of obligations. The earldom of Buchan, which he claimed in right of his wife, who was daughter of Alex∣ander Cumin, was dismembred in favour of Sir Alexander Mowbray, who had some pretensions to a part of the inheritance. This person had been a violent partisan of the Brussian interest; but had lately abandoned his party, and made his peace with Baliol. The cause between him and Beaumont was de∣bated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>4.</NOTE> in parliament: Talbot and Strathbolgy declared in favour of their countryman Beaumont; while the Scottish members espoused the interest of Mowbray. The dispute was carried on with great violence; and Baliol pro∣nounced sentence in favour of the latter. The parliament immediately broke up in great confusion. Beaumont and Athole retired to their respective earl∣doms; and Talbot, in his return to England, was taken by a party of Brus∣sians, and conveyed to the castle of Dunbritton. Baliol immediately saw his interest divided, and well nigh destroyed, by this dispute; and conscious of his own indiscretion, resolved to reconcile himself to the friends he had dis∣obliged: he revoked the sentence he had passed against Beaumont, gratified<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leland. Walsingham. Dugdale.</NOTE> Athole with a grant of other estates, and promised to pay Talbot's ransom. This accommodation was too late to repair the mischief he had done; because his friends were by this time despersed; and many despairing of his being able to maintain his dignity, had already inrolled themselves among the adherents of David. Some of the prelates and noblemen of that party had retired into France, and sollicited succours from Philip, who renewed the league which
<PB N="21" REF="230"/>
had been made between his predecessor and Robert de Brus; and sent a body of troops, commanded by Arnoul de Audenham, to assist them against Baliol. These succours, and the promise of further reinforcement, concurred with the dissensions among Edward's party, to elevate the hopes of the Brussians, and encourage them to raise forces for the restoration of David. The lord Andrew Murray, guardian of Scotland, who had been prisoner at Roxburgh, recovered his liberty in this critical conjuncture, and put himself at the head of that in∣terest. He was joined by Mowbray, now disobliged in his turn at the repeal of the sentence, which had been pronounced in his favour: they invested the lord Beaumont in his strong castle of Dundurg, and compelled him to capi∣tulate. The earl of Athole fled into Lochabar, but being close pursued, was obliged to submit, and take the oath to David, whose friends in a very little time made themselves masters of all the northern part of Scotland.</P>

<P>Edward king of England had summoned a parliament at London, to deliberate on the subject of an expedition he proposed to undertake for the relief of the Holy Land, in conjunction with other European princes: but, when he heard of this turn of affairs in Scotland, that design was post∣poned; and their deliberations adopted a more interesting object. They im∣mediately granted extraordinary subsidies for the reduction of the insurgents in Scotland: the king forthwith summoned the military tenants, and resolved to pass the winter in the north, that he might be at hand in the spring to invade that country with a powerful army. Mean while he sent a body of forces to the assistance of Edward Baliol, who, thus reinforced, over-ran all the western parts of Scotland; and had well nigh taken Robert, the steward of that kingdom, a youth about fifteen years of age, the nephew and heir of David de Brus, whom he succeeded on the Scottish throne. He was lord of Bute and Arran, two islands which Baliol reduced: but young Robert escaped his search, and took refuge in the castle of Dunbritton. During these transactions in the west,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford. An. Ch. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.</NOTE> king Edward entering Scotland by Berwick, marched into the heart of the kingdom without seeing the face of an enemy; and, in his return, received a letter from Patrick Dunbar earl of Marche, containing a formal renunciation of his homage. In all probability the siege of his castle would have been the immediate consequence of this defection, had not the operations of war been suspended by the arrival of ambassadors from France, sent to mediate an ac∣commodation between the Scots and the king of England. A treaty was im∣mediately begun at Gedeling, near Nottingham, whither the Scottish com∣missioners repaired, under the security of a safe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conduct; and in the mean time both parties agreed to a cessation of arms, to continue to the following Midsummer. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>The plan of pacification drawn up by the French ambassadors, who were in the interest of the Scots, was utterly rejected by Edward, who resolved to treat with them in another manner. All the bishops, barons, and free∣holders, in Ireland, were ordered to contribute a certain proportion of men and money for the reduction of Scotland: the earls of Namur, Juliers, and Montbeliard, were engaged in the service of England; and directions given for equipping large fleets in Gascony and England. The lord justice D'Arcy brought a body of forces from Ireland, in six and fifty vessels, with which he ravaged the i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les of Bute and Arran. The king assembled his army in June, and dividing it into two bodies, sent one to invade Scotland, by the
<PB N="22" REF="240"/>
way of Berwick, under the command of Edward Baliol, assisted by the earls of Surrey and Arundel, the lords Beaumont, Percy, Nevil, Stafford, and Cantiloupe; while he himself, accompanied by the count of Juliers, at the head of his foreign knights, and the chief nobility of England, entered the enemy's country by the way of Carlisle; and a fleet of one hundred and sixty sail were ordered to cru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se along the coasts of that kingdom. The Brussians were not so mad as to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace these armies in the field. They retired, as usual, with their valuable effects to their mountains, forests, and morasses, from whence they occasionally attacked the straggling parties and detachments of the English; and the two kings met at Perth, after having ravaged the whole country through which they passed. While they resided at this place, the young count of Namur, in his march to join them with a body of fo∣reigners, was attacked in a moor near Edinburgh by a superior number of Scots, under the command of the earls of Marche and Murray, and Sir Wil∣liam Douglas. The foreigners, and their young count, fought with great gal∣lantry, till they were overpowered, and then they retreated to the rock on which the castle of Edinburgh had stood. There they fortified themselves amidst the ruins of the fortress which Edward had ordered to be demolished; but, as they were destitute of provision, they could not help surrendering at discretion. The earl of Murray, from a principle of romantic honour, not only dismissed him without a ransom, but also conveyed him safely into Eng∣land; and as he returned from thence he fell into an ambush, formed by the garrison of Roxburgh, by which he was routed and taken prisoner. Edward continuing still at Perth, detached the forces of the four northern counties, under the command of his brother John of Eltham, and Sir Anthony Lucy, to reduce and ravage Galloway, Carrick, Kyle, and Cuningham, where the interest of Brus chiefly predominated; and a body of Scots advancing against them, with the earl of Marche and Sir William Douglas, a very obstinate<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghton D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gdale.</NOTE> engagement ensued, in which the enemy were defeated with considerable slaughter.</P>

<P>This defeat struck a damp into the hearts of the Brussians, who could have very little reason to hope for success against such a powerful mo∣narch as Edward, who was already in possession of the whole kingdom, and numbered great part of the natives in his service. Robert the steward, and David earl of Athole, despairing of being able to maintain the war, sent com∣missioners to sue for peace, and make a tender of their submission; and the season being pretty far advanced, Edward, who had no inclination to spend the winter in Scotland, lent a willing ear to their proposals. The treaty was ma∣naged by Alexander and Geff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey Mowbray; and, after some debates, concluded on condition that the Scottish noblemen should have the benefit of a general amnesty: enjoy the lands, honours, and offices, in Scotland, and be restored to the possession of their estates in England, which had been confiscated; that the kirk, and boroughs of Scotland, should enjoy all their privileges and franchises; and all the offices of the crown and kingdom be bestowed on natives only, except in some particular cases, where king Edward Baliol might see reason to exert his prerogative in behalf of persons of a different nation. To these articles, signed at Perth in the month of August, Duncan earl of Fife, and others of the Scottish nobility, acceded; and some who held out
<PB N="23" REF="250"/>
till September, in hope of being succoured from France, seeing themselves disappointed from that quarter, submitted to the terms of the following agree∣ment. They promised to obey Baliol as their king, during his natural life, on condition that David de Brus should succeed him on the throne of Scot∣land, and in the mean time be honourably maintained at London. They even undertook for David's appearance in the English parliament, to be held after Michaelmas, in London, to stand to the award of his king and his coun∣cil. After this agreement the king convened the bishops, noblemen, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Knyghton.</NOTE> freeholders, of his party, at Edinburgh, where two instruments were drawn up, and sealed with the great seal of the kingdom, declaring that David's pre∣decessors, kings of Scotland, had held, in antient times, their realm of the kings of England, to whom they had done homage, and swore fealty, as ap∣peared by old records, and pleas of the crown. David therefore, by his letters∣patent, expedited with the advice and consent of the three estates of the kingdom, in parliament at Edinburgh, did acknowlege to hold the kingdom of Scot∣land, and also the isles, of Edward III. king of England, by liege, homage, and fealty, as of the superior lord of the kingdom of Scotland, notwith∣standing all, and all manner of releases, remissions, quit claims, and other letters whatsoever, made by any king, or kings, of England to the contrary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This charter, contained in a chest entitled Scotia, is to be seen in the old Chapter-house in the cloyster of We<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>minster-abbey; and is sup∣posed by Tyrrel, and other judicious English his∣torians, to be a piece of forgery.</NOTE>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte.</NOTE></P>

<P>Andrew Murray the regent, and the greatest part of the Scot∣tish nation, were not concerned in these transactions, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till continued to annoy the English, and the adherents of Baliol, with hot incursions and des∣perate attacks: nor did they yet resign the hopes they had conceived of being powerfully succoured by the French monarch. The king having received the homage of those who submitted to his sway, ordered the fortifications of Perth to be repaired, the castles of Edinburgh, Stirling, and Bothwel, to be rebuilt; and leaving the earl of Athole guardian of the northern parts of the kingdom, returned to Berwick in the beginning of October. David Strathbolgy earl of Athole had been received into favour, upon his declaring that the fealty he had sworn to David de Brus was the effect of compulsion; and, in order to manifest his zeal for the service of Edward, he marched at the head of three thousand men to besiege the castle of Kildrummy, in which the regent's wife resided. Murray was no sooner informed of her danger, than he assembled a small body of forces, and marched to her relief, accompanied by the earl of Marche and Sir William Douglas; and although inferior to Athole in num∣ber, gave him battle without hesitation, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a place called Kilblane, where Da∣vid Strathbolgy was defeated and slain. The victors, encouraged by this ad∣vantage, invested the castles of Coupar and Lochindoris: and the progress of their arms in that part of the country contributed more than the intercession of the pope and the French king, to prevail upon Edward of England to con∣clude a truce with the regent, to continue till the ninth day of May, in the succeeding year. This suspension was intended as the prelude to a peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> and the treaty was set on foot at Newcastle, to which place the regent, with Sir William Douglas, Sir William de Keith, and Robert Lauther, repaired on the faith of a safe-conduct, which was likewise granted to six other com∣missioners

<P>Notwithstanding the professions of Philip de Valois, he was so far from being hearty in his endeavours to promote an accommodation, that his envoys, by his direction, started such difficulties as rendered the confe∣rences<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. 1336.</NOTE> of no effect. It was the interest of the French king to foment the war, that Edward, being employed at home, should have no leisure to execute the scheme he had projected for the support of his pretensions to the kingdom of France. Philip had publicly declared that he would assist his allies the Scots to the utmost of his power: he had already sent over considerable supplies of men, money, and ammunition, with some officers of experience; and he ca∣joled them in such a manner, with promises of more powerful reinforcements, that their commissioners rose very high in their demands; so that the nego∣tiations were broke off, and the regent waited with impatience for the expira∣tion of the truce, that he might take the field and renew the operations of war. Edward was per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ectly well acquainted with the complexion of the French po∣litics, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oresaw that the conferences would prove abortive; he was informed of all the transactions of the Scots, not only at the courts of Paris and Rome, but also in several other countries, where they sollicited succours with good prospect of success; and he resolved to proceed in his preparations, without depending upon the issue of the negotiation. He had, in two successive par∣liaments at York and Westminster, enacted several laws for the benefit of commerce, and some salutary regulations for the prevention and punishment of robbery and rapine; and his subjects, both of the clergy and laity, with whom he was by this time become extremely popular, chearfully granted con∣siderable<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.

<P>Thus amply supplied with money, he summoned his military te∣nants to meet him in arms at the place of rendezvous in the north, so as to be ready to enter Scotland at the expiration of the truce; and appointed Henry, son of the earl of Lancaster, commander in chief of the forces destined for that expedition. About the latter end of June he convoked a parliament at Northampton, to concert measures for defeating the designs of France, from which an invasion was expected; and while he and his parliament were en∣grossed by these deliberations, he received intelligence of the hostilities re∣commenced by the Scottish regent Murray, who, as soon as the truce expired, took the field with a body of forces, reduced the castles of St. Andrews and Bothwel, and invested those of Stirling and Lochindoris. The king, alarmed at his progress, set out immediately for Berwick, where he was joined by a body of troops, with which he proceeded to Perth; and his arrival was no less welcome to his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riends than disagreeable to the enemy, who no sooner un∣derstood that he was in Scotland, than they made a desperate assault upon the castle of Stirling, in which Sir William de Keith was slain. Being repulsed in this attempt with great loss, and informed that Edward was on the march to relieve the place, they abandoned that enterprize, as well as the siege of Lochindoris, and retired to their fastnesses, to avoid a general battle. The king advanced through Athole to Inverness, and from thence proceeded by Elgin through the shire of Murray, which he laid in desolation. The lord
<PB N="25" REF="270"/>
Beaumont, who commanded a separate detachment, put all to the sword with¦out mercy whom he suspected of having been concerned in the battle against his brother-in-law the earl of Athole. The town of Aberdeen was levelled to the ground, in revenge for the death of Sir Thomas Rosselin, whom the in∣habitants had attacked and slain on his landing at Dunotter; and Edward having made a progress to the extremity of Scotland, returned to Perth, leav∣ing the country he had over-run a miserable monument of his vengeance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun.

<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>Edward's return from this fruitless expedition seems to have been hastened by the accounts he received of the French king's designs and prepara∣tions. That monarch had by this time equipped a powerful armament by sea and land, for the assistance of the Scots, and appointed their young king David admiral of his fleet: under this youthful commander his navy scoured the channel, ravaged the isle of Wight, and the islands of Jersey and Guernsey; and while he threatened a descent upon England, a strong army was assembled in order to invade Guienne. Edward, tho' he wanted to avoid an open rup∣ture with France, until he should have entirely reduced Scotland, thought it high time to provide for the safety of his kingdom. He sent for a fleet from Bayonne, in Gascony, to come and cruise in the English channel; and though he could not prevent the preparations that were making in Holland, Denmark, and Norway, for the benefit of the Scots, he prevailed upon the states of Genoa and Provence to put a stop to the armaments which the king of France had set on foot among them, under the pretence of fitting out a navy for the pur∣poses of the crusade. The king having taken these steps, repaired to England, and summoned a parliament to meet at Nottingham on the twenty-third day of September, where some sumptuary laws were enacted, restricting the prelates and nobility to two courses at every meal, except at great festivals; and pro∣hibiting all who did not possess one hundred pounds a year, from wearing furs, or silk of foreign manufacture: at the same time the use of foreign cloth was limited to the royal family alone. In consideration of these prudent laws, by which the progress of luxury was checked, and the English manu∣factures encouraged, the clergy and laity granted him a considerable subsidy, besides an additional duty on wool; and he returned to Scotland, where his presence was as necessary as ever. He had no sooner quitted that kingdom<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> than Andrew Murray, at the head of the Brussians, took the field, and reduced the castles of Dunotter, Kinnef, and Lauriston, which he had fortified in his last expedition; and his brother, John of Eltham, whom he had left with Baliol to command his forces, died at Perth in his absence. The king arrived at that place in the beginning of November; but as Andrew Murray, at his approach, retired to the forest of Platen, where he remained during the whole winter, all Edward's military operations amounted to no more than burning and wasting the open country, and repairing the castles of Stirling, Edin∣burgh, and Roxburgh. It was at this juncture, that receiving advice of the depredations committed by the French fleet upon his territories and subjects, he impowered the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishop of London, the earls of Surrey and Lancaster, with William Clifton, constable of Dover, to hold
<PB N="26" REF="280"/>
a great council at London, and concert proper means for defending the king dom, and the coast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from David de Brus and his adherents: at the same time, he granted a commission to Geoffrey de Say, one of his admirals, to equip a strong fleet, and assert his dominion in the English sea, which his predecessors had always maintained; and in particular to fall upon the galleys of France, should<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> they move towards the coast of England or Scotland. He had attempted to compromise his difference with the king of France, in the way of negotiation; but now seeing the affected delays of that monarch terminate in open hostilities committed at sea by his ships, and in Guienne by his army, he resolved to be trifled with no longer, but prepare for a vigorous war; not only in putting his kingdom in a posture of defence, but likewise in strengthening his hands with foreign alliances. For this purpose he sent agents to treat with the duke of Austria, the archbishop of Cologne, and the bishop of Liege; and em∣powered his allies, the counts of Hainault, Holland, and Juliers, to contract with such potentates as they should think proper to engage in his interest. In order to attach the duke of Brabant to his cause, he consented that a staple of English wool should be fixed at Brussels; though such an exportation was very prejudicial to the manufactures of his own country, and diametrically opposite to his former policy, which had prompted him to grant extraordinary en∣couragement to such weavers and clothworkers of the Low Countries as should come over and settle in England.</P>

<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P N="27"><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1337.</NOTE> That these measures might be taken with the greater dispatch, he returned to England, and convened a parliament at Westminster, in March, when his eldest son Edward was created duke of Cornwal; Henry, eldest son of the earl of Lancaster, was promoted to the earldom of Derby; that of Gloucester was conferred upon Hugh de Audeley, William Clinton was made earl of Hurr∣tingdon, William de Bohun was gratified with the earldom of Northampton, William de Montacute was created earl of Salisbury, and Robert D'Ufford<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> earl of Suffolk. These promotions were the prelude to a war with France, which Edward determined to prosecute against Philip, not for the recovery of the lands in Guienne which he had seized, but for his whole kingdom, of which he conceived himself to be the true heir, as next in blood to the late king. He was encouraged in these sentiments by Robert D'Artois, related to the blood royal of France, who was at this time a refugee in England. That noble∣man, who had married Philip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s sister, presuming upon this alliance, and his great power and influence in the kingdom, revived a law-suit for the county of Artois, which had been formerly decided in favour of his aunt Maude, daughter of Robert count of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; and, in order to support the process, he produced some deeds forged for the purpose by a lady of Bethune, called Di∣vion, who possessed an amazing talent of counterfeiting seals and writings. The forgery however was detected, and Divion, in consequence of her own<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> General <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> France.</NOTE> confession, condemned to the flames. The deed was cancelled, and Robert dismissed from court with disgrace. Being afterwards summoned before the court of peers to answer for this subornation, he refused to appear; and after three citations he was banished the kingdom, and his estate confiscated. Thus exiled he retired into Brabant, from whence he came over to England; where he met with a very honourable reception from Edward, who affected to treat him with the same distinction which was paid to David de Brus at the court of France. Being a man of extraordinary courage, experience, and capacity, his advice
<PB N="27" REF="290"/>
had great weight in the councils of England; and as his resentment against Philip was implacable, all his advice tended to a war with that monarch, founded on such a principle as would hardly admit of any accommodation. Edward had offered to leave all his disputes about Guienne to the arbitration of the pope, though he knew that pontiff was in the French interest; and Be∣nedict earnestly exhorted Philip to do him justice, that peace being restored, he might engage in the crusade against the infidels. All his remonstrances producing nought but evasive answers, his holiness pressed him either to begin the voyage, or refu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the money which had been raised from the clergy of France, by the grant of his predecessor, towards the charges of the expedition. Philip, who could no longer amuse him with vague promises and professions, at length plainly gave him to understand, that he would never conclude a peace with Edward so long as he granted protection to Robert D'Artois; and the king of England would not so far derogate from his own dignity as to with∣draw his favour from that nobleman. Nevertheless, the pope still persisted in his mediation, and Edward sent ambassadors to the French court to adjust the articles of a peace, which were at one time settled to the mutual satisfaction of both parties; when Philip insisting upon Scotland's being included in the treaty, and that David de Brus should be restored to the throne of that kingdom, the negotiation was interrupted until the English ambassadors should receive farther instructions on that head from their master, who was so much incensed at these new demands, that he swore he would sooner destroy the whole realm of Scot∣land, than agree to such unreasonable conditions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baron.

<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Every thing now presaged an immediate rupture between the crowns of France and England. The French already commenced hostilities, by making incursions into Guienne, and seizing the castles of that province. Edward calling a parliament in Lent, explained to them the nature of his dif∣ference with Philip, the steps he had taken towards an accommodation, and the progress he had made in contracting foreign alliances to assist him in his quarrel; and they, as well as the nation in general, glowed with uncommon ardour and impatience to retort the hostilities which the French had begun. The bishop of Lincoln, and the earls of Salisbury and Huntingdon, were ap∣pointed as embassadors to finish the treaties which had been set on foot with dif∣ferent powers; and an attempt was made to engage Lewis count of Flanders in the league, by the proposal of a marriage between his eldest son and the king's daughter: but he was too intimately connected with Philip to be swayed even by that temptation. The ambassadors repairing to the court of Hainault, with a long retinue of young noblemen and knights, who made a very splendid appearance, concluded the treaties with that count, the duke of Brabant, the marquis of Juliers, the counts of Gueldres, Losse, Mons, Marcke, Palatine, with several other princes of the empire, and even the emperor Lewis of Ba∣varia himself, who agreed to furnish Edward with a certain number of troops, to be maintained at the expence of England. Though the count of Flanders<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froiss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt. Rymer.</NOTE> could not be detached from the interest of Philip, it was thought proper to tamper with the Flemings, who hated the French, and derived considerable advantage from their commerce with England. The large towns were in a manner independent of the count, and particularly the city of Ghent, which was actually govern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by a rich brewer called Jacob Van Ardevelt. This plebeian was a man of an enterprising genius, extrem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly popular, so wealthy that he maintai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d a guar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of four<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ore soldiers about his person,

and employed spies in all the different towns of Flanders, to give him intelli∣gence of every thing that was transacted either in town or country. He was more powerful than the count himself, and stuck at no measures, however cruel and unjust, to strengthen and maintain his interest. He had employed his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>issaries to dispatch several noblemen, and bani<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h others, who presumed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppose hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> power: he confi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ated their estates for his own use, and was become so absolute and ter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ible<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that no person would venture to contradict whatever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e thought proper to propose in the assembly of the states of Flanders.

<P>Count Lewis, on the other hand, exerted all his influence in tra∣versing the negotiations of the English; and espoused the cause of Philip with such a degree of fury, as prompted him to put a nobleman of Courtray to death, without form of process, because he favoured the interest of Edward. He sent his natural brother, Guy de Rickenbourg, with a body of forces to secure the isle of Cadsant, cut off the communication between those parts and Brabant, and intercept the English ambassadors in their return. These being apprized of his intention, remained at Dort until a fleet of forty ships was sent for their convoy; then they sailed for England, and in their passage fell in with two large Flemish ships of war, having on board the bishop of Glasgow, with one hundred and fifty Scottish gentlemen, a considerable sum of money, and a small body of soldiers, sent from the king of France to the assistance of the Brussians in Scotland: the ships were taken and plundered, and the bishop,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> with his followers, cut in pieces. As Guy de Rickenbourg, in being master of Cadsant, had it in his power to intercept all passage by sea to Bruges and Ghent, Edward resolved to dislodge him from that post, and sent the earls of Derby and Suffolk, with several other noblemen and knights, five hundred men at arms, and three thousand archers, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> board his fleet, to expel the Flemings from the island. Their landing was obstinately disputed by Guy de Rickenbourg, at the head of five thousand men; in spite of whose efforts the English made good their footing on the beach, though, even after their land∣ing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a desperate engagement ensued. The earl of Derby was felled to the ground, but rescued by Sir Walter Manny, a gallant knight of Hainault, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose prowess the victory was in a great measure owing. Three thousand of the enemy were killed upon the spot, and a great number of persons of dis∣tinction taken prisoners, among whom was their commander; by whose <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ansom Sir William Manny was enriched. Immediately after this action, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich happened in the beginning of November, Ardevelt, who had warmly e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>poused the cause of Edward, pressed him to come over immediately and head the allies in person; but he thought proper to postpone the expedition, because some alteration had happened in his affairs. The count of Holland and Hain∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ult had died in June; and though the son engaged in the confederacy, it suf∣fered an irreparable loss in the death of the father. Edward had appointed John duke of Brabant his heutenant and vicar-general in the kingdom of France, and actually directed him to claim and take seisin of that realm in his name; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, as war was not yet declared, the pope laboured with great industry to prevent the calamities that must have attended a rupture between two such powerful mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>archs; and, in compliance with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est of his holiness, Edward named two

commissioners to treat of a peace with France and Scotland.

<P>In a parliament which met in the beginning of February, Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1338.</NOTE> represented the extraordinary occasion he had for large sums of money, to pay the subsidies which he had granted to his foreign allies; and the prelates, nobility, and freeholders, indulged him with a moiety of their wool, which sold for four hundred thousand pounds sterling; besides a duty of two shillings a tun upon wine, added to the usual customs, paid by all foreign merchants: over and above this enormous imposition, the inferior clergy assembled in convo∣cation at St. Bride's in London, granted a tenth of their revenues, exclusive of the tax of a triennial tenth, to which they had before consented. This was the heaviest burden that ever had been laid upon the nation, to which it was so grievous, that the king desired the two archbishops, and their suffra∣gans, to represent his necessities to the people, in such a manner that they should bear the load with patience. Vast as the subsidy may seem to have<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. Claus. 12. Edw. III.</NOTE> been, considering the value of money in those days, it was unequal to the ex∣pence of his armament, and treaties of alliance; for the German princes were ever as insatiable in their demands, as dilatory in the performance of their con∣tracts. The king, about this period, prevailed upon the lords of Le Bret, Cau∣mont, and other powerful noblemen of Gascony, to renonunce their engage∣ments with Philip, who had by this time con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscated Guienne and Ponthieu; he then borrowed money of several abbeys for present use, and assembled his army and navy without delay. His eldest son Edward was appointed guardian of the realm; and proper precautions being taken for preserving the peace of the kingdom in his absence, he sailed from the port of Orewell on the nine∣teenth day of July, with a fleet of three hundred vessels, attended by the prime nobility of England; and after an easy passage arrived at Antwerp, the capital city of John duke of Brabant. On the day after his arrival he had a conference with Ardevelt, who persuaded him to assume the title of king of France, that the Flemings might have a colour for taking up arms against their lord, and elude the payment of two millions of florins, which they had obliged themselves, on pain of interdict, to pay to the pope, if ever they should make war on the king of France. Edward, who had long hesitated on this subject, at length complied with their request. He had, at the desire of his holiness, sent the prelates of Canterbury and Durham, with three other ambassadors, to the French court, with powers to negotiate and conclude a peace with Philip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom he stiled king of France: but now he revoked these commissions, and prohibited them from doing any thing in his name which might be prejudicial to his right, or construed into an acknowlegment of Philip's title. As for the homage he had formerly done to that prince, im∣plying a full recognition of Philip's right to the throne of that kingdom, he considered, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>owned it as the act of a minor, extorted by the fear o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> losing Guienne.</P>

the beginning of August. At that time all of them appeared at the rendez∣vous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> except John duke of Brabant, who, though the king's first cousin, had given Philip private assurances that he would never enter into any engagement to his prejudice. John's absence served as a pretence for the rest to decline the performance of their contracts until he should be ready to concur with them in their operations. The king of England was so chagrined at these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asive ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uses, that he began to repent of having undertaken the expedition: but, as h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had proceeded too far to retract with honour, he resolved to attach the duke and in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abitants of Brabant to his interest, by granting them certain immunities in trade, by which they were heartily engaged in his alliance. John now assured him that he would renounce all connection with Philip, and concur with the rest of the allies in assisting Edward to the utmost of his power. They were again conv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned about th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> middle of the month, and una∣nimou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly resolved to attack France, if they could procure the sanction of the imperial authority, to which they were subject. This they hoped to obtain without difficulty, as Philip had encroached upon the empire, in taking the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astle of Cre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecoeur, and putting a garrison into Cambray, at the desire of the bishop, who had demanded his protection. The king sent the marquis of Juliers, and some other commissioners, to prepare matters at the imperial court; and he himself afterwards repaired to Coblentz, where the emperor readily granted all he demanded, and even created him vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar of the empire; an office<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> by which his German allies were peculiarly subjected to his orders. He held an∣other council at his return to Brabant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and it was unanimously resolved that their troops should rendezvous next year on the eighth day of July, in order to undertake the siege of Cambray. Edward thinking it necessary to pass the win<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er in Brabant, that he might be at hand to quicken their preparations, and overawe the bishop of Liege, who adhered to France, sent for his queen to Antwerp, where she was in November delivered of her third son, named Lionel, who was afterwards created duke of Clarence. His alliance with the emperor gave great umbrage to the pope, because Lewis of Bavaria, who now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the imperial throne, had been excommunicated and deposed by the late pontiff, for having set up an anti-pope, from whose hands he had received the crown.

The king, however, paid very little regard to the remonstrances of a pontiff who had been always in the interest o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his enemy; and although his ambas∣sadors were still employed in treating of a peace at Compeigne and Arras, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontinued to exert his industry in making vigorous preparations for the ensuing campaign.

Then he fell upon the Vermandois; though when he entered this country, which properly belonged to France, the counts of Hainault and Namur retired with their troops, declaring they would not serve out of the territories of the empire. Though thus weakened, he re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olved to undertake the siege of Cambray, and actually encamped before the place, which he found so well provided for sustaining a tedious siege, that he abandoned the enterprize, and marched towards the French army, with which Philip lay encamped in the neighbourhood of Peronne. The two monarchs continued a whole week within two leagues of each other, in the fields be∣tween Veroufosse and Flemenguere; and on Wednesday the twentieth of Octo∣ber, Edward sent a herald to desire that Philip would appoint a day for the battle. The French king pitched upon the following Friday, when both armies were drawn out early in the morning; the English and their allies not exceeding seven and forty thousand men, and the enemy amounting to double that number. After having stood in order of battle, facing one another the whole day, they retired to their respective camps, and appeared again next morning in the same disposition. In the afternoon the French retreated into their quarters, which they fortified with trenches, and trunks of trees cut down for the purpose; while Edward wheeled off towards Avesnes, for the benefit of a more convenient encampment, and sent another message to Philip, im∣porting that he would wait for him all Sunday in order of battle. The French king was inclined to hazard an engagement; but his council representing the imprudence of risquing his crown upon a battle with an enemy whom the weather must in a little time compel to retire, he provided his frontier towns with strong garrisons, and retired to Paris; and Edward being informed of his retreat, permitted the Germans to go home, while he himself, with his own troops, returned to Brussels. Among Philip's subjects, none distinguished themselves so much by their zeal as the Normans, who sent deputies to their king at Vincennes, offering, if he would allow his son John to be their com∣mander, to make a descent in England, and defray the greatest part of the expence that would attend the expedition. They proposed to furnish four thousand men at arms, ten thousand cross-bow men, and thirty thousand in∣fantry, for the conquest of this kingdom, which was to be given to prince John; and this proposal was qualified with some articles to which Philip gladly gave his assent. This project was defeated by the measures that were taken in England to protect th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a-coast, and the invasion of France, on the side of Flanders, by Edward, against whom the French king was obliged to employ his whole force and attention.

His absence had pro∣duced manifold disorders in England, chiefly arising from bands of free∣booters, formed in different parts of the kingdom, who ravaged the country, and set justice at defiance; and the Brussian Scots took this opportunity to re∣tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eve what they had lost, and even to make incursions on the English Marches. In the course of the preceding year, Sir Andrew Murray, the guardian of Scotland, had reduced all the places of any strength on the north side of the river Tay; and defeated a body of four thousand English, commanded by the lord Henry Montfort, who lost his life in the engagement. The earl of Dunbar having renounced the allegiance he had sworn to Edward, after the battle of Hallidowne-hill, and taken the field with Murray, while his castle was besieged by sea and land, by the lord Henry Plantagenet, the earls of Salis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bury, Angus, and Arundel, and gallantly defended by the countess, who re∣ceiving a supply of men and provisions, under the conduct of Sir William Ramsay, made a furious sally, and ruined all the works of the besiegers. The arrival of this reinforcement, together with the news of Montfort's defeat, induced the English noblemen to raise the siege, that they might advance to the relief of their countrymen. For this purpose, they sent two large detach∣ments from the main army, by different routes, under the command of Wil∣liam Talbot, and lord Richard Montague, who joining at Panmuir, in Angus, were defeated, and Talbot was taken prisoner. The castles of Edinburgh, Stirling, and Coupar, were now the only places of consequence remaining in the hands of Baliol. Sir William Douglas had made an unsuccessful attempt upon the first of these; and about this time the Brussians sustained an irre∣parable loss in the death of their guardian, in which office he was succeeded by Robert Stewart, who was connected with David by the ties of consanguinity. He invested and took the town of Perth, which was well fortified, and supplied with a strong garrison; and the castle of Coupar was surrendered to him by William Bullock, treasurer to Edward Baliol, who seems to have betrayed his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ford<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</NOTE> trust, and revolted to the Brussian interest.</P>

<P>The party of Baliol being now totally subdued in Scotland, and all the conquests of Edward in that country lost in his absence, the Brus∣sians ventured to retaliate the miseries they had undergone, by depredations upon his subjects, and ravaged the northern counties of England. In order to repel these incursions, the parliament, which met in October, appointed commission∣ers of array to levy forces; and the clergy, in the convocation of York, were enjoined to grant an aid for the defence of the Marches. The king had sent over agents to explain the nature of his necessities to this parliament, and de∣mand a considerable subsidy; in consideration of which, the archbishop of Canterbury was impowered to grant such concessions as they could in reason desire. The earls and barons taking the affair into deliberation, agreed to give the tythe of their flocks and corn for one year; but the knights of the shire alledged that they could not agree to this subsidy, until they should have con∣sulted their constituents; and desired they might be indulged with time for that purpose. The discussion of this affair was accordingly postponed to a new<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parl. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> III.</NOTE> parliament, to meet at Westminster in January; and at their desire, a clause was inserted in the writ of summons, providing that none but knights should be returned as representatives of counties. The king was very much chagrined at this delay of the supply: his allies were grown clamorous for money;

and the duke of Brabant would not consent to his going over to England<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> until he had given security for his returning within a week after Midsummer. He presented that nobleman with a grant of fifteen hundred pounds a year; and promised to gratify the marquis of Juliers with an earldom in England. He made another fruitless attempt to gain over the count of Flanders to his interest, by promising to assist him in the recovery of Artois, to which he had some pretensions, and proposing a match between his eldest son and Edward's daughter Isabel. Though he could not detach the count from Philip, he con∣tracted a closer connection with the Flemings, by engaging to assist them in the recovery of Lille, Douay, and Bethune, which they had been forced to give up to Philip as pledges of their fidelity; and seeing no hope of an ac∣commodation, quartered the arms of France with those of England. The in∣scription on the great seal was altered from Duke of Aquitain to King of France; and, instead of the former motto, he assumed that of Dieu et mon Droit, alluding to the design of supporting his pretensions to the crown of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rainald.

<P>The treaty between Edward and the Flemings being ratified at Ghent, they did homage, and took the oath of allegiance to him, as the lord paramount of their country; and then he published a manifesto, asserting his right to the crown of France, and justifying the steps he had taken in support of his claim. In a consultation with his allies, it was agreed that the next<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1340.</NOTE> campaign should be opened with the siege of Tournay: then embarking for England, he landed at Harwich in February; and that same day issued out writs for convoking a parliament at Westminster, on the twenty-ninth day of March. In the preceding session, which was held in January, provision had been made for fortifying Southampton, and the isle of Wight, equipping a fleet of one hundred and fifty sail, to guard the channel, sending supplies to the castles of Edinburgh and Stirling, and raising a number of men at arms, light horse, and archers, for the defence of the Marches. Some offers had been made of a supply for his majesty's occasions, but as he himself arrived in the mean time, the consideration of that affair was postponed to this new parliament, from which he received a very extraordinary aid, consisting of the ninth sheaf of corn, the ninth fleece and lamb for two years, to be levied on the prelates, earls, barons, and all the freeholders and tenants of the kingdom: the citizens and burgesses paid a ninth of their goods and merchandize; but such tradesmen and inhabitants as lived in wastes and forests were taxed only at a fifteenth of their moveables. In consideration of these supplies, the king consented to the remiss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of old debts and trespasses of the forest, contracted and committed before his coronation: the two charters, with the privileges and franchises of boroughs, were confirmed; an uniformity of weights and measures was established through the whole kingdom; and many wholesome regulations were made for redressing the grievances of the subject, in the op∣pression practised by goalers, the delay of law-suits, and the frauds of sheriffs, in farming hundreds at higher rates than were paid to the crown. It was decreed that all pardons for murders or felonies, contrary to the tenour of the corona∣tion oath, should be deemed null; and the king waved his right of purveyance, in the contracts to be made with merchants, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or supplying his forces or garrisons with provision.

Notwithstanding this intelligence, Edward resolved to cross the sea at the time he had fixed for his departure, which was the thirteenth day of June, and payed so little regard to the remonstrances of his chancellor the bishop of Chichester, who endeavoured to divert him from his purpose, that this pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>late resigned the seals, and withdrew from court. The king, startl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at his resignation, consulted with lord Morley and Crab, his two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hief admirals; and they confirming the suggestions of the archbishop, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdered the naval force of his kingdom to be assembled, to the number of two hundred and sixty sail, for his convoy, and sending for the archbishop, r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-delivered the seals into his hand. He ordered this fleet to be well manned with a strong body of men at arms, and archers; and having borrowed twenty th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usand marks of the city of London, for present use, set sail from Orewell, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded by the principal nobility of England. Next day, in making the land of Blanckenberg, he descried the masts and streamers of the enemy's f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet lying in the harbour of Sluys, and set on shore some knights to observe t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em more narrowly, and bring an account of their number: but they returned with their intelligence so late, that he could not begin the engagement that evening; and was obliged to lie all night at anchor.

desperate engagement, which lasted from ten in the morning till seven at night. The ships immediately grappling each other, the troops on board fought hand to hand with incredible fury: the noblemen and knights exerted all their prowe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in signalizing themselves under the eye of their sovereign, who ani∣mated them by his own example: the English archers, who excelled all the world in bowmanship, made a terrible slaughter among the French and Ge∣noese; and the men at arms boarding their ships, attacked them with such irresistible valour, that they leaped into the sea by hundreds, in order to avoid the horrors of the assault. The first line of the French being thus de∣feated by main force, and the second already disordered, lord Morley arrived with the northern fleet, and some Flemish vessels, and falling in among the shattered squadrons of the enemy, bore down all opposition. At length Ed∣ward obtained a complete victory. Two of the French admirals were slain, with upwards of twenty thousand men; and though sixty sail escaped under the third admiral, two hundred and thirty of their largest ships were taken.

<P>This glorious victory not only animated the English to sup∣port their monarch to the utmost of their endeavours, but encouraged his al∣lies on the continent to redouble their vigour, in executing the plans of the confederacy. These Edward assembled in a general council at Vilvorden, where the countries of Flanders, Brabant, and Hainault, engaged in a close union for their mutual defence, under the arbitration of Edward, whom they impowered to decide in all disputes that might happen in the course of their as∣sociation. At the same time it was agreed, that two armies should be formed without delay; one to be composed of Flemings, reinforced with a body of English archers; and the other to consist of Edward's own troops, with those of the allies. The first, amounting to fifty thousand men, was sent under the conduct of Robert D'Artois, to invest St. Omer, the garrison of which was commanded by Eudes IV. duke of Burgundy, and the count D'Armagnac; while the other, which was twice as numerous, was employed by the king in person in the siege of Tournay. Robert D'Artois sat down before St. Omer on the twenty-second day of July; but his operations were soon at an end, by the cowardice of the Flemish troops, who being seized with a panic, fled in the utmost precipitation, even before any enemy appeared. Edward ad∣vancing towards Tournay, sent an herald to Philip de Valois, challenging him to decide their quarrel by single combat, or by fighting at the head of one hundred men, to spare the effusion of christian blood; or, should he de∣cline accepting this defiance, to appoint a day for a general engagement be∣fore the walls of Tournay. Philip disavowed this address, because it was not directed to the king of France; but signified that he would not stoop so far beneath his own dignity, as to put himself on a footing with his vassal, whom he would chastise for his rebellion in a manner more suitable to the insolence and perfidy of his conduct.</P>

It was stipulated that both sides should retain the places which they then possessed; that the siege should be raised; and the Scots, with some of the allies, have the benefit of the cessation, provided they should think it worthy their acceptance.

The king of England was become so moderate that he now insisted upon nothing but the enjoyment and undisputed sovereignty of Guienne: but this the French absolutely refused to grant, or even to treat upon the subject, until he should renounce the title of king of France, which he had lately as∣sumed.

<P>By this time Edward found cause to repent of having incon¦s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derately engaged in an expensive war, from which he saw no prospect of extri∣cating himself with honour. He could not pretend to maintain it without allies; and they were so venal and rapacious, that he could neither depend upon their integrity, nor feed the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r avarice. He had as yet received no re∣mittances from England; so that being unab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to pay their subsidies, his re∣putation began to suffer, and their attachment to waver. They were afraid of incensing France beyond a hope of reconciliation; and, in this apprehension, extorted Edward's assent to the truce which had lately been concluded. He had been obliged to silence their clamorous demands with bonds at an exorbi∣tant interest; and now leaving Henry of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancaster earl of Derby, in pawn for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e payment, stole away privately to Z<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aland, where he embarked with his

queen for England. After a very stormy passage of three days, he landed on the last day of November, about midnight, at the Tower of London, which he found utterly unguarded. Nicholas de la Beche, the constable, who was ab∣sent from his duty, and all his subalterns, were imprisoned for their negli¦gence and relaxation of discipline. But the king's resentment fell still heavier on the officers of the revenue, to whom he imputed the dishonour which he had sustained on the continent. The bishops of Chichester and Litchfield were deprived of their offices of chancellor and treasurer; Sir John St. Paul, keeper of the privy seal, the sheriffs of counties, the collectors of taxes, and other public officers, were turned out of their employments; and a commission was issued for enquiring into their failures and misdemeanours, for which they were punished with great severity.</P>

<P>John Stratford archbishop of Canterbury, had been vested with the charge of paying the king's debts to the towns and merchants of Brabant and Flanders: tho' the first year's ninth had been assigned for that purpose, the col∣lectors neglected to remit the money; and their negligence was one cause of the king's disgrace and disappointment at Tournay. Edward sent Nicholas de Can∣taloup with a public notary to the archbishop of Canterbury, to warn that pre∣late to take care of his bonds, and either discharge them immediately, or cross the sea to Flanders, and reside in that country until the money should be paid. In the mean time he desired the metropolitan would come to court, and give an account of the proceedings of those to whom he had entrusted the management of the revenue. Stratford excused himself from appearing at court, where he should be exposed to the malice of his enemies; and said he would consider of the other part of the king's proposal. Far from complying with Edward's desire, he sum∣moned the clergy and laity of Canterbury to the cathedral, where, in an elaborate harrangue, he extolled the conduct of Thomas Becket, blamed himself for having been too much engrossed in secular affairs, declared his resolution for supporting the rights of the church; and, as the imprisoned officers were generally clergy∣men, denounced the sentence of excommunication against all who should seize the persons, lands, or effects, of the clergy, invade the liberties of the church and Magna Charta, or inform against a bishop for treason, or any capital of∣fence. He afterwards, in a letter to the king, communicated the censures he had passed, complained of the imprisonment of the clergy, which had been owing to the suggestions of evil counsellors; exhorted him to summon the pre∣lates and peers of the land, in order to promote a proper enquiry concerning the embezzl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment of the wool and money, which had been granted in the late parliament; and offered to stand to the judgment of his peers, saving the rights of the holy church, and the dignity of his own order. The king<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1341<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> having perused this letter, sent Ralph lord Stafford, steward of his houshold, to require the archbishop's attendance at court, about affairs of the greatest im∣portance to the king and kingdom. John pretended that he could not obey the king's order, with any regard to his own personal safety; but this ob∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction being removed by the grant of a safe-conduct, he formed other evasive excuses to colour his disobedience. He professed himself champion for the liberties of the clergy; sent mandates to his suffragans to publish his censures, and inhibit ecclesiastics from paying the ninth lately granted in parliament, on pretence of their being liable to a tenth whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h they had before voted in convo∣cation. The king, in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his conduct, forbade the bishops to publish the
<PB N="$$" REF="400"/>
censures or the mandate; and wrote a letter to the prior and chapter of Can∣terbury, giving a detail of the archbishop's misdemeanours, and ordering them to publish it in all proper places. About this same time some merchants of Br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, empowered by the duke, repaired to Canterbury, and being refused a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mittance to the archbishop, fixed a cit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion on the public cross, near the gate of the priory, requiring him in the duke's name to appear in his courts of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustice, to answer for the debts in which he was bound, and remain in the Low Countries until they should be discharged. Stratford made a public de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence in the pulpit to the articles of his charge, contained in the king's letter, which he treated as a scandalous libel; and published an apology for the vin∣dication of his conduct, in which he expatiated upon the services he had done the state, particularly in making two and thirty voyages to the conti∣nent at his own expence. The king made a reply to this apology, which he accused as false and insolent; and forbade him, and all other bishops, to publish any spiritual censures prejudicial to the royal prerogative, as exercised by his predecessors. An information was preferred against the archbishop in the court of exchequer, before which he was summoned to appear; but he re∣fused to plead to a charge of such importance before any other jurisdiction than that of the lords spiritual and temporal assembled in parliament.</P>

<P>When this assembly met in April at Westminster, the metropolitan, secured by a safe-conduct, appeared with a pompous train of bishops and clergy; but was not permitted to take his seat until he should have put in an answer to the articles exhibited against him in the exchequer. He received a copy of this accusation, of which he promised to consider, and then insisted upon taking his seat as the first peer of the realm. Being again denied ad∣mittance, he stood at the door grasping his cross, and declaring his resolu∣tion to maintain the rights of the church; but all his efforts were ineffectual, even though he sollicited some lords, as they came from the house, to use their good offices with the king in his behalf. Disgraced as he was, he had a strong party among the temporal peers, as well as the bishops, who were deeply in∣terested in his quarrel; and they resolved to exert themselves in his favour. When the king, in a full meeting of both houses, desired they would represent all manner of grievances, that the subjects might obtain redress, they consulted together, and brought in a bill, couched in the form of a petition, importing that the peers of the land should not be bound to answer for any offences charged upon them by the king, except in parliament: that this demand ap∣pearing inconsistent with the interest of the government, which would not admit of waiting for the convocation of a parliament to punish every offen∣der, they petitioned the king for leave to appoint a committee of twelve per∣sons to consider in what cases peers should be bound to answer in any other court than that of the parliament. After some debate it was agreed that peers should be tried only by their peers in parliament; and that their temporalities, lands, tenements, and effects, should not be seized, nor their persons arrested, for any thing relating to any office they should enjoy under the crown; saving, however, the king's rights, and the suit of parties; and provided that those peers who were sheriffs, or farmers of counties in fee, or had received any of the king's money and effects, should accompt for it by themselves, or their at∣torneys, in the usual places. This law immediately affected the case of the archbishop, who declared himself ready to answer the articles in full parliament.
<PB N="39" REF="410"/>
Having made his submission to the king, in the Painted-Chamber, he was very graciously received, admitted to his seat, and assured of being heard as soon as the affairs of state should be regulated. The bishops of Durham and Sa∣rum, the earls of Northampton, Arundel, Warwick, and Salisbury, were ap∣pointed to receive and deliberate upon his answers, which should be referred to the next parliament; but by that time he found means to recover the king's favour, and the process against him was annulled. Before this session broke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Angl. Sacr. Rot. Parl.</NOTE> up, the prelates and nobility insisted upon Edward's confirming the two char∣ters, and redressing the grievances of the nation. They proposed that the king should, on the third day of every session, resume all posts and places into his own hands, that the officers might be put to answer all the charges that should be brought against them in parliament; that all the great officers of the crown, and the judges, should be sworn to maintain the two charters, and all the privileges of the nobility, clergy, towns, and corporations. But these two points were over-ruled, as being deemed sufficiently secured by the laws already in force. They demanded, however, in a more peremptory manner, that the clergy should be exempted from the attachment of their persons and effects, as well as from fines imposed by lay judges without the concurrence of their ordinary; that the king's officers should not enter their houses, granges, or churches; and that the civil judges should not take cognizance of usurers, commutation-money, testamentary and matrimonial accompts, which they al∣ledged were matters belonging to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. These, and other articles, were drawn up in the form of a statute, and confirmed by the great seal; though much against the inclination of Edward, whose neces∣sities obliged him to comply with their demands, as they refused to deliberate upon subsidies until this affair was discussed. The chancellor, treasurer, and several judges, protested against the passing of this act; and the king declared he would revoke, with the first opportunity, every grant or concession that should be extorted from him in such a manner. He accordingly, in a great council held about Michaelmas, annulled this statute, as far as he had power so to do, and inhibited the archbishop of Canterbury from taking any step in the ensuing provincial synod, towards the confirmation of that pretended statute, or the prejudice of his royal dignity and prerogative. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE></P>

<P>Whatever reluctance Edward might have had to a compliance with a demand of this nature, he saw it was the only expedient by which his necessities could be relieved; and in that light it was very convenient and ef∣fectual; for this statute was no sooner confirmed, than the parliament indulged him with a subsidy of twenty thousand sacks of wool, to be transported to Flan∣ders, before Michaelmas; and all other persons were prohibited from sending over any quantity of the same merchandize till after that period, on pain of forfeiting thrice the value, together with life and member. This aid, how∣ever, did not arrive in time to repair the damage which his credit had suffered in the preceding campaign. The emperor Lewis, disappointed in his expecta∣tion of English money, and influenced by French gold, as well as by the in∣stances of his wife, who was niece to Philip de Valois, deprived Edward of the vicariat of the empire, and espoused the interest of his enemy. The archbishops of Mentz and Cologne, with other princes of the empire, en∣gaged in the service of France; the pope effected an accommodation between the count of Hainault and the bishop of Cambray; and the French garrison

While Edward found himself thus abandoned by all his allies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the continent, and utterly disabled from carrying on the war in Flanders, he was, by an unexpected event, furnished with an opportunity of attacking Philip, in the very heart of his dominions, with less expence, and a<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> greater probability of success.</P>

<P>John III. duke of Brittany dying without issue, left his dominions to his niece Jane, married to Charles de Blois, nephew to the king of France: but John de Montford claiming the dutchy as his brother, was received as the successor by the people of Nantes, where he summoned an assembly of the states, that his title might be recognized. The majority of the nobles having already taken the oath to Charles de Blois, whom they considered as the true heir, in right of his wife, and as a prince who would be supported by the whole power of France, the assembly was very thin, and indeed no person of consequence attended, except Henry de Leon, a nobleman of great valour, experience, and interest. John, however, with his brother's money, which he seized, began to levy troops, and assembled an army, with which he re∣duced a great number of towns and castles that adhered to his rival; but, as he expected a vigorous opposition from France, he resolved to strengthen his cause with some powerful alliance. With this view he had recourse to Edward king of England, who being now disengaged from his German allies, em∣braced his proposals without hesitation. John came over to the English court, where, by the interposition of his kinsman Robert D'Artois, the treaty was soon concluded, and he returned to Nantes, where he received a citation to attend the court of peers in France, in order to prove his title to the dutchy of Bretagne. Considering the steps he had taken, and the little reason he had to expect impartiality from Philip, who was uncle to his competitor, sound<NOTE PLACE="marg">D'Argentré H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> de Bre∣tagne.</NOTE> policy, and the dictates of self-preservation, ought to have prevented him from obeying the summons; in consequence of which, however, he went to Paris at the appointed time, with four hundred gentlemen in his retinue. At his first audience, Philip told him he had no right to the dutchy; and even charged him with having entered into alliances with the enemies of France: but he excused his voyage to England, on pretence of solliciting for the earldom of Richmond, which his brother had enjoyed; and with respect to the dutchy, he expressed his readiness to stand trial, and abide by the decision of his judges. The king promised that his title should be examined within a fort∣night; and in the mean time ordered him to keep within the walls of Paris. John perceiving from this premature declaration, how little he had to expect from the justice of Philip; and apprehending that monarch's design was to arrest his person, until he should have delivered up all the towns and fortresses he possessed in Brittany, was now convinced of the erroneous step he had taken, and saw no other way of extricating himself than that of a private and preci∣pitate retreat. Having taken his resolution on this subject, he amused Philip with a petition to be admitted to pay homage, and directed his agents to re∣double their sollicitations. Mean while, he disguised himself in the dress of a burgher, and with four attendants quitted Paris early in the morning. The
<PB N="41" REF="430"/>
rest of his retinue and domestics remained at his lodgings, and provided for his table as usual, giving out that he himself was confined in his chamber by an indisposition. In this manner was his departure concealed for four days, during which he arrived in his own territories; but, Philip was no sooner ap∣prised of his retreat, than he gave way to the first transports of his indigna∣tion; ordered the parliament of Paris to adjudge Brittany to Charles de Blois, without waiting to proceed in the usual forms; and immediately confiscated the county of Montfort. That the fugitive might feel his resentment still more sensibly, he supplied Charles with a numerous army, which rendezvoused at Angers, under the command of his eldest son John duke of Normandy, at∣tended<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Froissart.</NOTE> by several princes of the blood and the flower of the French nobility. The first attempt was on Chantoceaux, which sustained several assaults before it surrendered; then they invested Nantes, the reduction of which they owed to the treachery of the citizens. Henry de Leon the governor having made a sally, in which two hundred of the inhabitants were taken prisoners, John de Montfort reprimanded him for the rashness of his conduct in such a manner that he could not digest the affront, and is said to have betrayed his master. The gates of the place were next morning opened to the French, who took possession of the city without resistance; and seizing John in the castle, sent him directly to Paris, where he continued several years in prison.</P>

<P>This disaster would have effectually crushed his party, had not his interest been maintained by the extraordinary talents of his wife Jane of Flanders, a lady of a masculine genius, who fought like a warrior in the field, and spoke like a politician in the council. She happened to be at Rennes when her husband was taken prisoner; but his misfortune did not drive her to despair. She forthwith assembled the citizens, and holding in her arms her in∣fant son, recommended him to their protection, as the last male heir of the race of their dukes, in such a pathetic manner that they resolved to spend their lives and fortunes in his service: then she secured the fidelity of the troops by dint of largesses; and appointing William Cadoudal governor of the city, conveyed her son to Hennebon, a considerable port in Brittany, to wait for succours from England, in pursuance of the treaty concluded between Edward and her husband. A body of troops had been actually assembled for this ser∣vice, under Robert D'Artois, Walter de Manny, and the lords Morley, Ferrers, Tibetot, and Bardolph, and a fleet provided for their transportation; but, be∣fore the time fixed for their departure from Portsmouth, Edward's presence was required in the north to watch the turn of affairs in Scotland.</P>

<P>While he was engaged at the siege of Tournay, in the course of the preceding year, William lord Douglas had taken the castle of Edinburgh by surprize; and the Scots being comprehended in the truce concluded with Philip, no hostilities were committed in that country till Midsummer, when the term of the cessation expired. Then they invested the castle of Stirling, and carried on their attacks with such vigour that the garrison was obliged to capitulate before Edward could march to its relief. Though he could not<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1342.</NOTE> prevent this disaster, he determined to revenge it with the desolation of all Scotland. For this purpose he issued orders for assembling an army of fifty thousand men at Newcastle by the twenty-fourth day of January; and equip∣ped a powerful fleet to attend the motions of his land-forces and supply them
<PB N="42" REF="440"/>
with provision in the barren country through which he meaned to penetrate. The lord Robert Steward guardian of Scotland, Douglas, and other noblemen of that realm, alarmed at the prospect of such a mighty armament, resolved if possible to avoid the storm which impended over their country, and sent am∣bassadors to Edward to sollicit a truce for six months, on condition of sub∣mitting to his government, provided David de Brus should not before the first day of May return from France with succours, and assemble a force able to meet the English in fair battle. Perhaps the king of England would have lent a deaf ear to this proposal, had not his fleet, on which he in a great measure depended, been dispersed, shattered, and rendered unserviceable by a tempest; but this being the case, he consented to the truce, upon receiving security for the performance of articles, and returned in the beginning of February to London. This suspension of hostilities however was of short duration; for David returning to Scotland, the truce was terminated of course. Sir Alexan∣der Ramsay took the castle of Roxburgh by scalade, and was appointed go∣vernor of that fortress; but was afterwards starved to death by William<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> Douglas, whose jealousy could not bear a rival in reputation. William Bul∣lock was slain about the same time by David Barclay; and other desperate f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uds breaking out between powerful noblemen, involved the whole kingdom in carnage and confusion. This was no time to maintain a war against such a powerful neighbour as England; and David Brus, being sollicitous to heal these fatal divisions, endeavoured to procure a respite from hostilities. Ed∣ward, being intent upon the affairs of Brittany, was not averse to a treaty, which was accordingly brought upon the carpet; and though a solid peace could not be effected, a truce was concluded, with the consent of France, for<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> two years, and afterwards renewed for two years longer.</P>

<P>During these transactions, Jane of Brittany sent Amaury de Clisson to forward the succours from England; and that officer brought over her young son to be educated in the court of London, as a place of safety: at the same time she proposed a match between him and one of the king's daugh∣ters, which afterwards took effect; and offered to put Brest and some other for∣tresses into his hands, as security for his being reimbursed whatever he should expend in her assistance. Edward, being very well satisfied with her propo∣sals, issued orders for assembling one hundred ships at Harwich, to transport Sir Walter de Manny with three thousand archers and a good number of other troops to Brittany; another fleet was ordered to rendezvous at Portsmouth, for the conveyance of a stronger reinforcement, under the com∣mand of William de Bohun earl of Northampton, whom the king appointed his lieutenant in the realm of France and dutchy of Brittany; and he was ac∣companied by Robert D' Artois and a great number of English noblemen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mean while Charles de Blois, attended by the dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon, the counts of Alençon, Eu, and Guisnes, Lewis D' Espagne of the house of La Cerda, and many other French noblemen, had taken the field with a for∣midable army, reduced Rennes and invested Hennebon, which was defended by the countess in person. This heroine repulsed the besiegers in all their assaults with amazing valour. Observing one day that their whole army had quitted the camp to join in a general storm, she sallied out by a postern, at the head of three hundred horse, set fire to their tents and baggage, put their sut∣lers

and servants to the sword, and occasioned such an alarm, that the French desisted from the assault, in order to cut off her communication with the town. Thus intercepted she retired to Auray, where she continued five or six days; then returning at the head of five hundred horse, fought her way through one quarter of the French camp, and entered Hennebon in triumph. The enemy, enraged at seeing themselves thus baffled by a female, gave a general assault, which lasted from morning till three in the afternoon, when they were repulsed with great slaughter; then judging it impracticable to take the town without the military engines which they had left at Rennes, Charles de Blois left Lewis D' Espagne with part of the army to wait the arrival of those im∣plements, while he marched off with the rest to besiege Auray<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lewis, being furnished with those machines, plied them so vigorously, that great breaches were made in the ramparts, a number of the defendants was killed by the stones and missiles, which they threw without intermission; and in a word, the place was reduced to extremity, when the English fleet, after having been detained two whole months by contrary winds, arrived in the harbour. Wal∣ter de Manny and Amaury de Clisson, being landed with the forces, made a sally, in which they destroyed all the works and engines of the besiegers; and Lewis D' Espagne despairing of success, abandoned the enterprize, and joined<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.

<P>He was immediately detached to besiege Guingam and Guerrande, which he reduced; then putting six thousand of his men on board of a fleet, he landed near Quimperlé, and ravaged the country without opposition.

The engagement lasted with great obstinacy till night, when they were parted by a furious storm, which however did not prevent the English from arriving next day at Hennebon.

<P>Edward set sail from Sandwich on the fifth day of October; and landing in Bretagne, declared he did not come as an enemy to France, but merely as an ally of the count de Montfort. In four days after his arrival he
<PB N="44" REF="460"/>
invested Vannes; but the place being well fortified, and provided with a nume∣rous garrison, his assaults were not attended with success. He therefore changed the siege into a kind of blockade. Leaving part of his troops for that ser∣vice, he marched towards Rennes, and took Malestroit and Ploermel in his way<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then advancing to Nantes, in hope of drawing Charles de Blois to an engage∣ment, before he was reinforced by the succours he expected from France, he arranged his army in order of battle before the town, and set fire to the su∣burbs. Charles, though extremely provoked at this insult, would not hazard a battle, because he expected every day to be joined by the duke of Normandy, who was at this juncture employed in assembling an army at Angers. The king o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> England, leaving a few troops to maintain the appearance of a siege, returned towards Vannes, which was very hard pressed by the English, when the duke of Normandy advanced at the head of forty thousand men to the re∣lief of Nantes. Edward immediately recalled his troops to strengthen his own army, which did not amount to twenty thousand men at arms, in∣fantry, and archers; and when the duke advanced to Vannes, he found the English monarch strongly intrenched. The French followed his example; and, both armies lay facing one another during the best part of the winter, in the course of which they suffered greatly from the severity of the weather, though the English were obliged to endure an additional hardship in the want of provision; for their communication by sea was greatly interrupted by the activity of Lewis D' Espagne, who hovered on the coast with a fleet of thirty<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Argent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>é.</NOTE> ships and one hundred gallies. Yet Edward, as he daily expected relief from this and other difficulties, by the arrival of a fleet and forces from England, would not abandon the siege, in which his reputation was concerned. While the English and French armies continued in this situation, two cardinals ar∣rived at Malestroit as embassadors from Clement VI. who had been just elevated to the papacy, and expressed an earnest desire of mediating a peace between the kings of France and England. By this time both sides were pretty well disposed to an accommodation; for the French general dreaded the arrival of succours from England, and Edward was very much hampered and dis∣couraged by their delay.

proceeded directly to London. Six days before his arrival, a parliament had been assembled at Westminster, to deliberate upon the truce and the proposed treaty, as well as to take cognizance of the state of the government, and pro∣vide for the peace and safety of the nation. These points were debated by the bishops, prelates, and barons, in the White-Chamber; while the knights of the shires and the commons took them under consideration in the Painted∣Chamber of the palace: and this is the first time that we find a clear distinc∣tion between the two houses, as it is at present maintained. Having maturely considered the subject before them, they concurred in approving the truce as honourable and advantageous, and recommended the treaty of peace as a de∣sirable object, if it could be procured on equitable terms; otherwise they pro∣mised to maintain his quarrel to the utmost of their power. When the king desired to know if they had sustained any grievances in his absence, they com∣plained of some hardships, and demanded that a commission should be given to justices, chosen in parliament, to maintain the peace in the several counties, and hear and determine causes of felony, conspiracy, champerty, breaches of the peace, unlicensed amortisement of lands, fusion of gold coin by gold∣smiths, exportation of good and importation of bad money by merchants, provisions and usurpations of the court of Rome. This commission was ac∣cordingly issued<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but it proved so disagreeable to the subjects in general, that it was vacated in the next session. The inconveniencies of adulterated coin were remedied by prohibiting the importation of bad money under severe pe∣nalties, and a new coinage of silver sterlings and gold florins, of the same value with those of Flanders, that they might pass in both countries, with the consent of the Flemings, which he sent commissioners to obtain: at the same time he wrote to the pope and cardinals, desiring they would put a stop to the provisions and other usurpations, by which they distressed the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>The commencement of the treaty to be held in presence of the pope, was postponed to Lent, on account of some infractions of the truce by the partisans of France in Bretagne, for which Philip delayed giving proper satis∣faction: and when it was brought upon the carpet, the conferences proved ineffectual; for the English commissioners insisted upon their beginning with the discussion of their master's right to the crown of France; and Philip de∣clared that the king of England should never enjoy one foot of land in France, except that which he might hold in vassalage. The pope endeavoured to pre∣vail upon both sides to relax a little in their pretensions; but they were equally inflexible, and the negotiation proved abortive. By this time the quarrel was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1344.</NOTE> inflamed with personal rancour, and all thoughts of terminating the war in an amicable manner, had vanished. Immediately a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter the truce, Philip had seized as many of the partisans of John de Montfort as fell into the hands of his officers, pretending they were not included in the agreement; some of these were put to death, and the rest confined in loathsome prisons. He laid the blame of these outrages on Charles de Blois, who pretended to justify his conduct by alledging that he was not mentioned by name; and therefore no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> included in the treaty. It was stipulated, that John de Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et at liberty on his giving security that he would do nothing against the pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensions of Charles de Blois, during the continuance of the truce; and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

nephew John, eldest son of Bouchard count of Vendome, engaged for the performance of this article. Nevertheless, he was still detained in prison; and Philip, in answer to the pope's expostulation, affirmed that he was not now a prisoner for any public reason that concerned the king of England, but for some particular causes of another nature. The true reason of this treatment was the ambition of Philip, who refused to release him, unless he would give up Brest and Hennebon, and renounce all claim to the dutchy of Bretagne: but nothing fixed such an indelible stain on the character of the French king, as his behaviour to Oliver de Clisson, who had served him and Charles de Blois with uncommon fidelity. He had been taken prisoner in the course of the war, and exchanged by Edward for the lord Stafford, at the sollicitation of his brother Amaury, who happened to be in the service of the countess of Brittany. The preference given on this occasion by the king of England to Oliver over John de Leon, who was also his prisoner, and the circumstance of his brother's being attached to John de Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, excited the jealousy of<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.

<P>This act of tyranny was so highly resented in Bretagne, that the baron de Loheac abandoned the French interest; and the people of Vannes rising in arms, declared for John de Montfort, after having expelled the pope's garri∣son. These circumstances served to confirm the suspicion of Philip, who forthwith issued orders for apprehending Geffrey de Malestroit, with his son John, and eight other noblemen of Bretagne; and though they had all distin∣guished themselves in the service of Charles de Blois, they were executed in the same infamous manner which had been practised upon Oliver de Clisson. Edward of England had proclaimed in all parts of Europe a Round Table to be held at Windsor, on the nineteenth day of January; and granted safe-con∣ducts to knights of all countries, without distinction, who should honour his festival with their presence. Philip of France, either inspired by emula∣tion, or apprehensive that the bravest knights in Europe, allured by this invi∣tation, would engage in the service of England, endeavoured to divert them from crossing the se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on this occasion, by proclaiming such another Round Table, on the very same day at Paris, on pretence of doing honour to the nupti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of his second son Philip with Blanche, the posthumous daughter of Charles the Fair, his predec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssor.

<P>When the parliament met in June, Edward complained to them of Philip's cru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lty, injustice, and violation of the truce; for, besides the infrac∣tions we have already mentioned, he had sent a numerous body of troops into Guienne, where they reduced castles and towns, and ravaged the country. He likewise attempted to debauch Edward's allies from his interest, even during the negotiation before his holiness; and every part of his conduct de∣noted a fixed resolution to prosecute the war. The ear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Derby and Arun∣del had been sent with some troops into Guienne, to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end that country from the incursions of the French; but as further preparations seemed necessary, the parliament exhorted him to pursue vigorous measures, either to conclude a final treaty of peace, or terminate the war by a decisive battle. This advice was supported with the grant of subsidies to equip an armament against France, and defend the border from the irruption of the Scots, who pro∣fessed themselves entirely devoted to the interest of Philip. But this was not the only fund from which Edward derived supplies for the service of the year. He summoned all freeholders possessing forty pounds a year, who were not already knighted, to come and receive that honour; and a consid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rable sum arose <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the fees of that ceremony.

<P>The earl of Derby landing at Bayonne on the sixth day of June, advanced immediately towards Bergerac on the Dodogne, where the French were posted under the command of Barnard count de l'Isle Jourdain, whom he found strongly intrenched in the suburbs; from whence he could not have been dislodged without great difficulty. But the French, confiding in their numbers, mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a sally; and, being routed, the English entered with them pell mell into their intrenchments, from which they retired to the city. Here the count stood one assault, in which the English made a lodgment on the breach; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d then, retreating in the night to La Reole, disposed of his troops in several garrisons, which were all reduced by the victors; after which success the earl of Derby returned to Bourdeaux. The count de l'Isle was no sooner apprised of his retreat, than he suddenly assembled a body of twelve tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sand men; and investing Auberoc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, def<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded by an English garrison, battered it with engines so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iously, that in six days the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortifications were al∣most ruined.

having sent orders to the earl of Pembroke, who lay at Bergerac, to meet him with a reinforcement at Libourne, which he reached unperceived before morning: here having halted all day in expectation of being joined by Pem∣broke, he proceeded on his march at night; and, early in the morning, ar∣rived in a wood at the distance of two leagues from Auberoche. In this situation he continued the best part of the day, till despairing of the reinforce∣ment, he, by the advice of the gallant Sir Walter de Manny, resolved to beat up the French quarters, while the enemy should be at supper. With this view they marched under covert of the wood, till they were close to one quarter of their camp; then fell upon them so unexpectedly, that the counts de l'Isle, Per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gort, and Valentinois, were taken in their tents before they had time to make the least resistance; and their soldiers charged with such impetuosity, that they could make very little opposition: but while this quarter was filled with rout and confusion, the other half of the French army, commanded by the count of Comminges, took to their arms; and, being drawn up in order of battle, advanced against the English. The earl of Derby, though greatly inferior to them in point of number, resolved to make one vigorous effort to complete the work he had so successfully begun; and, re-assembling his scattered forces, attacked the enemy with incredible impe∣tuosity. He met with a very warm reception, and, an obstinate engagement ensuing, both sides fought a long time with dubious success, until the garrison of Auberoche hearing the trumpets sounding th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> charge on both sides, and descrying from a tower some English banners, though it was now the twilight, forthwith made a sally, and, falling on the rear of the French, d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cided the fate of the battle. The enemy was immediately involved in darkness and disorder, and utterly defeated with considerable slaughter; their loss in both a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions amounting to seven thousand slain, and twelve hundred taken pri∣soners; among whom were nine counts and viscounts, and two hundred knights and gentlemen of distinction.

About this period John de Montfort, after a severe imprisonment of near four years in the Louvre, found means to escape in the disguise of a beggar; and, coming over to England, where his wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e resided, sollicited the assistance of Edward so effectually, that all the conferences being at an end, and every prospect of a pacification intirely vanished, the king resolved to declare war against France, without further hesitation. He appointed the earl of Northampton his lieutenant, in that

kingdom and in Brittany, empowering him to defy Philip de Valois as a per∣jured truce-breaker; an usurper of the crown of France; and a mortal enemy to king Edward, his lawful sovereign. John de Montfort, having done homage at Lambeth for Brittany, to Edward, as king of France, and lord paramount of that dutchy, went thither in the beginning of June, with the earls of Northampton, Oxford, some other noblemen, and a considerable body of forces, by which he was enabled to reduce Dinan, and encouraged to invest Quimper-Corentin, which had lately been taken by Charles de Blois, who massacred fourteen hundred of the inhabitants: but his competitor ad∣vancing with a numerous army to the relief of the place, he was obliged to abandon the enterprize, and retired to Hennebon, where he died of a fever. Nevertheless, the earl of Northampton defeated Charles, in a pitched battle near Morlaix, and took Roche-derien by assault; but, winter approaching, he left the affairs of Bretagne to the care of Sir Thomas Dagworth, and re∣turned to England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Edward, when he empowered the earl of Northampton to bid Philip defiance in his name, notified this transaction to the pope, and published a manifesto for the justification of his conduct. This solemn declaration of a rupture between the two kingdoms, brought over a number of foreign sol∣diers of fortune. They longed to distinguish themselves under the eye of Ed∣ward, who, in valour, gallantry, and generosity, was universall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> allowed to exceed all the princes of his time: and among these was Godfrey d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Harcourt, lord of St. Sauveur le Vicomte in Normandy, who had been expelled the French court in consequence of a quarrel with Robert Bertrand, baron of Briquebec, marechal of France. They had drawn their swords in the king's presence, and Godfrey being cited before the parliament of Paris, refused to appear. After having been summoned four times, Philip banished him the realm, and confiscated his estate. Not contented with having punished his offence in this manner, he wreaked his vengeance upon his friends and relations: William Bacon, Richard de Percy, and the lord of Roche-Tesson, repairing to the tournament at Paris, were arrested and accused of high treason, and underwent the ignominious death which had been inflicted upon Oliver de Clisson, though, like him, they had always faithfully adhered to the interest of Charles de Blois. Godfrey would have been treated in the same manner, had not he retired to the court of John duke of Brabant, who being his kins∣man, tried in vain to make his peace with Philip: there he continued, boiling with resentment against his persecutor, till the defiance of Edward was pub∣lished, and then he hasted to the court of England, where he did homage to the king for his lands in France, and filled the place of his countryman<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>Before Edward would engage in an expedition against France, he summoned his former allies to perform their engagements, and in particular the duke of Brabant, with whom he had agreed upon a match between Jane, the duke's eldest daughter and heiress, and his own son Edward, who had been declared prince of Wales during the last parliament. The pope refused to grant a dispensation, as the parties were in the third degree of consanguinity; and the duke was by this time cooled in his attachment to Edward, by the indefatigable intrigues of the French court, which had found means to in∣fluence

The deputies startled at this proposal, desired time to consult their constituents, promisi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g to return in one month with a definitive answer; and Edward, perceiving their aversion and resentment to the propounder, prevailed upon Ard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>velt to accept a guard of five hundred Welshmen, under the command of Sir John d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>travers.

<P>He appointed the rendezvous of his fleet and forces at Portsmouth, on Midlent Sunday: but his navy being dispersed in a storm, it was deferred till the middle of May; and then he was prevented by contrary winds from executing his first design of landing in Guienne, which was about this time in∣vaded by John duke of Normandy, at the head of a prodigious army. While he continued wind-bound, with a fleet consisting of a thousand vessels, in which was embarked a body of troops, amounting to near forty thousand Welsh and English, headed by the prince of Wales and the flower of the nobility, God∣frey de Harcourt persuaded him to change the plan of operations, and make a descent upon Normandy, the inhabitants of which he represented as disaffect∣ed, degenerate, and defenceless. The king relished his advice, and sailing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Avesbury.</NOTE> from St. Helen's on the tenth day of July, landed in two days at La Hogue St. Vaast in Normandy. The greatest part of his fleet he sent back immediately; and ordered the earl of Huntingdon, who commanded the rest, to cruize along the coast, and destroy the ships which the king of France had equipped in different ports for an invasion of England. This service he performed with great success; and having ravaged the country, and burned the towns along shore, returned to La Hogue, in order to attend the motions of the army. Edward, having refreshed his troops, which had been long pent up in vessels, divided his army into three bodies, and began his march towards Valognes, from whence he proceeded to Carentan, which opened its gates at his approach. In the route he himself commanded the main body, while the earl of Warwick and Godfrey de Harcourt, at the head of the other two divisions, ravaged the country to a great extent upon the right and left, and found great plenty of provisions, with a very valuable booty. In this manner he advanced to St. Lo, which was taken after a slight resistance; and, continuing his march, arrived on the twenty-sixth day of the month in the neighbourhood of Caen, the capital of Lower Normandy. This place was garrisoned by a body of troops, under the command of the count d'Eu constable of France, and the count de Tancar∣ville chamberlain of Normandy, with the bishop of Bayeux: besides these a great number of gentlemen in the adjacent country had thrown themselves into it, at the approach of the English. Over-rating their own strength and valour, they next day made a sally with a great number of the inhabitants, who were so warmly received by the English archers, that they soon betook themselves to flight with great precipitation. The constable had lined the river Orne with regular troops, in order to defend the bridge; but such was the confusion of the townsmen, that they bore down every thing in their retreat; and the Eng∣lish pursuing with great impetuosity, they found all resistance impracticable. The bridge and barriers were forced, the constable and chamberlain, with about two hundred and fifty knights and gentlemen taken prisoners; and the best part of their forces put to the sword. The city being sacked and plundered,

yielded an immense booty, which, together with the prisoners of distinction, and three hundred of the wealthiest citizens, was put on board of the fleet lying at the mouth of the Orne, from whence it returned to England, laden<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>The French king had, upon the first news of Edward's descent in Normandy, dispatched messengers to John the blind king of Bohemia, his son Charles king of the Romans, the king o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Majorca, the duke of Lorraine, the count of Flanders, and his other allies, desiring them to come and join him with all expedition. He appointed a general rendezvous at Paris of all the military power of France, except such as was employed in the siege of Aguil∣lon, and in the mean time marched with a body of forces to Rouen, where he broke down the bridge over the Seine, to prevent the English from crossing that river. Edward, after the reduction of Caen, had received the submission of Bayeux and several other towns, and resolving to profit by the consterna∣tion that prevailed over the whole country, continued his march towards Rouen, notwithstanding the remonstrances and intreaties of the two cardinal legates, who met him at Lisieux with proposals for a suspension of hostilities. With∣out paying the least regard to his importunities, he proceeded to the banks of the Seine, where he saw Philip posted on the other side with a numerous army, in such a manner as rendered the passage impracticable. In order to provoke him to an engagement, he ravaged the country under his eye, took several towns, and reduced a great number of villages to ashes and desolation. In this employment he continued his progress, till he arrived at Poissy, where he ordered the bridge which had been broken down to be repaired, and passing the river in the face of the militia, which were routed by the earl of Northamp∣ton, made himself master of Pontoise, while Philip returned to Paris, the in∣habitants of which were terribly alarmed by the success of the English, who sent detached parties to ravage the neighbourhood of that capital. Their drooping spirits, however, were soon animated by the appearance of the prodi∣gious army which rendezvouzed at St. Denis. Philip, elated at the prospect, sent a letter to the king of England, containing a challenge to give him battle on the plain of Vaugirard, or between Franconville and Pontoise; and Ed∣ward replied, that Philip should find him always ready for an engagement, but he would never allow his enemy to prescribe the day and place of battle. Mean while he marched under the walls of Beauvais, and advanced to Poix, after having routed the militia of Amiens, and a party of horse belonging to the king of Bohemia. When he arrived at Ayraines, he began to be in want of provision, and found himself enclosed between the Somme, the sea, and the French army, which amounted to one hundred thousand men. Picquigny and Pont de Remy were too well fortified to be taken by assault; all the other bridges over the river were broken down, save those at Abbeville, and all the passages so well guarded, that he could not attempt them with any probability of success. At Oyesemont he found a French prisoner, who, in consideration of his liberty, and the reward of one hundred nobles, conducted him to the ford of Blanchetaque, which he found guarded by Godemar du Fray, at the head of ten thousand regular troops, reinforced by the militia of the country. Edward, seeing the necessity of passing at all events, was the first man who entered the river, bidding his soldiers follow him; and they obeying this order with great
<PB N="53" REF="550"/>
alacrity, a very obstinate dispute ensued; for the French cavalry rushing from the bank, engaged them in the midst of the river: but they were so terribly galled by the arrows of the English archers, that they did not long stand the shock of the men at arms, who soon forced their passage to the other side; and then the enemy fled in great disorder to Abbeville, where Philip arrived that same evening, at the head of an immense army.</P>

<DIV4 N="59" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LIX.</HEAD>
<P>The king of England having resolved to besiege Calais, followed that route by slow marches, and halted the first night at the castle of Noyelle, from whence he detached parties to burn Crotoye and other towns in the neigh∣bourhood. Next day he arrived at Crecy, where he encamped on an eminence, with a wood in his rear, and placed the baggage-waggons on the flanks, to se∣cure them from the attack of the enemy. While he thus pursued his purpose with great intrepidity and deliberation, Philip imagining that he fled before his arms, resolved to overtake and chastise the fugitive, who had made such ha∣voc in his kingdom. He accordingly marched from Abbeville towards the village of Crecy; and Edward being informed of his approach, drew up his army, consisting of thirty thousand men, in order of battle. The first line was commanded by the prince of Wales, just turned of fifteen, accompanied by the earls of Warwick and Oxford, Godfrey de Harcourt, the lords Stafford, Holland, Chandois, Clifford, with the flower of the English nobility, eight hundr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d men at arms, four thousand archers, and six thousand Welsh infantry. The second line was conducted by the earls of Arundel and Northampton, the lords Willoughby, Roos, Basset of Sipcote and Multon, Sir Lewis Tuf∣ton, and a great number of gentlemen, eight thousand men at arms, four thousand halbardiers, and about half that number of archers. Those two lines were formed on the declivity of the hill in such a manner, as to support one another; and the second outflanked the first, so as to prevent its being sur∣rounded by the enemy on the left, where it was secured by a semi-circular ditch dug in the night for this purpose, terminating in the park of Crecy, and the small brook of Maye which waters that village. The king himself commanded the third line, posted on the brow of the eminence behind the other two, com∣posed of seven hundred men at arms, five thousand three hundred billmen, and six thousand archers: he was attended by the lords Mowbray, Mortimer, Dagworth, Sir Hugh Hastings, and other persons of distinction. He and the prince of Wales had that morning received the sacrament with great de∣votion; and his behaviour denoted the calm intrepidity of invincible courage and resignation. Even the deportment of the prince of Wales, though a boy, was, in all respects, manly, heroic, and worthy of the great example he pro∣po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to imitate. The army being thus arranged, the king rode from rank to rank, with a chearful countenance, encouraging the soldiers to exert themselves for the honour of their country, the defence of their sovereign, and the preser∣vation of their own lives; and his words, his amiable figure, and his compla∣cency, animated them even to a degree of rapturous expectation. That they might have every motive to inspire them with extraordinary courage, he knighted fifty young gentlemen; and among the rest Sir John Beauchamp, whom he appointed to bear the royal standard in the battle. These previous dispositions being made, he ordered his men at arms to di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mount, that the horses might not be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atigued before the battle began, and his soldiers to be re∣freshed
<PB N="54" REF="560"/>
with a plentiful meal; after which they lay down in their ranks upon the grass to take their repose, that they might be fresh and vigorous at the approach of the enemy. The French king had begun his march at sun-rise from Abbe∣ville, with an army of one hundred thousand men; and having advanced two leagues, halted to draw up his cavalry in order of battle, while the infantry con∣tinued their march. Being now at the distance of five miles from the English, he detached four knights to view the posture of the enemy, which they were permitted to survey at leisure without molestation. They were astonished at the silence, order, and composure of the English army; and one of them, who was an experienced soldier belonging to the king of Bohemia, assured Phi∣lip there was no danger of Edward's running away. He told him, there was neither fear nor precipitation in the countenance of the English troops, but great serenity and resolution; he said their disposition was excellent, and their bodies in full vigour; and exhorted the king of France to advance no far∣ther that night, but allow his infantry to refresh themselves from the fatigue of a tedious march, otherwise he would not answer for the consequence, as they were at present spent with hard duty, and moving in the utmost disorder. Philip perceived the sanity of this advice, and sent immediate orders to the van to halt, until they should receive further instructions. But his commands were very imperfectly obeyed; for his army comprehending a great number of aux∣iliaries conducted by independent princes, among whom there was no subordi∣nation, they disputed the post of honour with each other, and vied in pressing forward to attack the enemy: when the front ranks halted, those who suc∣ceeded continuing to move with great impetuosity, that enormous body was pushed on towards Crecy in such confusion, as disabled them from acting with the least regularity. Even Philip himself, with the princes of the blood, were carried away by the croud; and he found it impossible to retard their motion, until they came within sight of the English. Then he made shift to arrange them in three distinct bodies, the first of which, commanded by John de Luxemburg the blind king of Bohemia, consisted of three thousand men at arms, nine and twenty thousand infantry, and fifteen thousand Genoese <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ross-bows, planted opposite to the English archers. The second division, con∣ducted by Charles count of Alençon, was composed of four thousand men at arms, and twenty thousand infantry, advanced in a line with the first battalia. Philip in person commanded the third body as a reserve, consisting of twelve thousand men at arms, and fifty thousand infantry. About three in the after∣noon, the French king began the battle, by ordering the Genoes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to charge; but they were so fatigued with their march, that they cried out for a little rest before they should engage. The count of Alençon, being informed of their pe∣tition, rode up and reviled them as cowards, commanding them to begin the on∣set without delay. They advanced with great reluctance, which was increased by an heavy shower which fell that instant, and rendered their bowstrings useless; so that the discharge they made could produce very little effect. On the other hand, the English arch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, who had kept their bows in ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and were favoured by a sudden glea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of sunshine that f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ashed in the faces of the enemy, let fly their arr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws so thick and with such good aim, that terrible havock was made among the Genoese, who finding themselves exposed to certain death, without being able to annoy their enemy, began to fly with disorder and precipitation,
<PB N="55" REF="570"/>
and were trodden down by the men at arms, under the command of the count of Alençon. That nobleman making a wheel in order to avoid the bowmen, charged with great fury the body conducted by the prince of Wales, who sustained the shock without flinching, and gave the count such a warm reception, that the greatest part of his men at arms was left dead upon the spot. While he main∣tained this conflict, the column of archers forty deep, posted on the right, which had already defeated the Genoese, was broke, by an impetuous onset of three squadrons of French and German knights, and a great body of men at arms; so that the prince was attacked both in front and flank at the same time. In this emergency, the earl of Warwick dispatched a messenger to the king, desiring him to advance to the prince's succour. Edward, whom he found in a windmill viewing the engagement, asked with great deliberation, if his son was dead, wounded, or unhorsed; and being answered in the negative, <Q>“Well then, said he, go back and tell Warwick, that I shall not intermeddle in the fray, but let my boy win his spurs by his own valour.”</Q> He perceived the confusion of the French, and their standards dropping very fast in that place where the prince was stationed, so that he concluded the enemy had miscarried in their assault; and as he had lately bestowed the honour of knighthood upon his son, he was loth to deprive him of any share of the glory. His conjec∣ture was just: before the knight returned with his answer, the archers had closed, and the earls of Arundel and Northampton advanced with a fresh body, by which the assailants were surrounded and cut in pieces. These victorious bands, joining under prince Edward, who fought with amazing prowess, advanced to attack in their turn the main body of the enemy commanded by Philip, who had been prevented, by the disorderly flight of his first line, from coming up to sustain the troops which had broke through the English archers. Here the battle was renewed with great obstinacy; Philip in person, the king of Bohe∣mia, and his son Charles, with a number of auxiliary princes, animating their soldiers to deeds of glory, not only by words, but by the example of their own personal prowess. Nothing, however, could resist the impetuosity and valour of the prince of Wales and his attendants. Flushed with the success he had already obtained, and inspired by the message he had received from his father<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under whose eye he acted in this first essay of his manhood, he redoubled his efforts and bore down all opposition. The blind king of Bohemia, whose ambition had for many years embroiled the best part of Europe, enquiring about the fate of the day, was told that the French were in terrible disorder; a great number of noblemen slain; that his son Charles had been obliged to retire dangerously wounded; that the English had made a dreadful carnage; and that the prince of Wales bore down every thing before him with irresistible valour. John having received this information, commanded his knights to lead him into the hottest part of the battle against the young warrior. Accordingly four of his attendants placing him in the middle, and interlacing the bridles of their horses, they rushed together into the thickest of the enemy, and the blind king interchanged a few strokes with Edward; but they were soon parted, and the Bohemian, with his followers, fell in the confusion of the battle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He wore three o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rich feathers for his crest; and as he acted in the capacity of a volunteer, he assumed the motto I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Dien, which, in the Ger∣man language, signifies I Serve. This device young Edward appropriated to himself; and it has been adopted by all succeeding princes of Wales.</NOTE>. By this

time Philip himself, af<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er two horses had been killed under him, was grievously wounded in the neck and thigh; and being carried out of the battl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by John of H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inault, the standard o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> France was beaten down. Then all r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sistance was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid aside; universal rout and undistinguished carnage ensued: though a great number of the French would have e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>caped by favour of the approaching night, had not the king of England ordered large fires to be made upon the neighbouring hills, by the light of which the victors prevented them from ral∣lying or uniting, and completed the slaughter. Edward, seeing the victory ac∣complished, descended from the hill, and running up to the prince of Wales, embraced hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> renderly in the sight of the whole army, saying, <Q>“My valiant son, God grant you may persevere in the course you have so gloriously begun. You have acquitted yoursel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nobly; and well are you worth the kingdom that will be your inheritance.”</Q> The prince made no other reply than that of a profound obeisance; and indeed his modesty and moderation were altogether surprizing and unexampled. In this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amous battle, which was fought on the twenty-sixth day of August, John king of Bohemia, James king of Majorca, Ralp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> duke of Lorraine, the counts of Alençon, Flanders, Blois, Vaude∣mont, Harcourt, Auxerre, Aumale, St. Pol, and Sancerre, four and twenty bannerets, twelve hundred knights, fifteen hundred gentlemen, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our thousand men at arms, and thirty thousand infantry, are said to have fallen, while the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Edward did not exceed three knights, and an inconsiderable number of soldiers. Philip, attend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by five knights and about sixty followers, was car∣ried to the castle of La Broye, about a league from Crecy, where, having taken some refreshment, he set out at midnight for Amiens, where he arrived early next morning. The victorious Edward having sounded a retreat, and ordered his men to be upon their guard all night, lest the French should rally, detached a party of lances and archers at day-light, to pursue the fugitives, and they meeting in a fog with the militia of Rouen and Beauvais, on their march to join Philip's army, rout<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them at the first onset. The archbishop of Rouen and the grand prior of France, advancing with a fresh reinforcement, were defeated and slain, with two thousand of their followers. The English gather∣ing some French standards that lay scattered on the field of battle, planted them on a neighbouring hill, as a decoy to the enemy who were dispersed about the villages, and the stratagem succeeded; for they flocked in numbers to their colours, and were hewn in p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eces without mercy; and indeed the only circum∣stance which tarnished the glory of this victory, was the order which Edward issued before the engagement, to give no quarter. The same injunction is said to have been laid upon the French army by their monarch: but this was an in∣stance of barbarity, in which his example ought not to have been followed. Though he refused mercy to the living, he was extremely courteous to the dead: he sent the body of John king o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bohemia to his family; he ordered the field to be consecrated, attended the funerals of the noblemen who had lost their lives in the battle, and ordered the common soldiers to be interred with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es.

<P>The king of England having stayed three days on the field of battle, continued his march for Calais, which he invested on the third day of Septem∣ber; and there we shall leave him to take a retrospective view of the operations in Guienne. At the latter end of the preceding year, Philip had sent his son, duke of Normandy, with a numerous army to recover the places which Henry earl of Lancaster had reduced in that province; and he accordingly arrived at Tholouse about the end of December. From thence he marched, in the be∣ginning of the year, to Miremont, which he reduced: Villefranche met with the same fate; and then he undertook the siege of Engoulesme, the garrison of which was commanded by John de Norwich, who made a gallant defence, un∣til his provisions beginning to fail, he proposed a cessation of hostilities for Can∣dlemas-day, that he might be at leisure to pay his devotions to the Blessed Vir∣gin; John agreeing to the proposal, he packed up his baggage in waggons over night, and marched off with his garrison to Aiguillon, the most impor∣tant place in all that country. It was well provided with stores and a good garrison, under the command of the earl of Pembroke, Sir Walter de Manny, and John de Mowbray, who repaired the fortifications, and took every other measure for making a vigorous defence, in case the siege should be undertaken by the duke of Normandy. These precautions proved very necessary; for, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter that prince had taken Tonneins, Damasan, Port St. Marie, he invested Aiguillon, and began the most memorable siege which had been carried on for many ages. Battering engines of a prodigious size were plied against the place incessantly, and assaults given for a week together without intermission, that the garrison might be tired out with continual fatigue; but the French were repulsed in every attack, and the duke, after an infinite number of fruit∣less attempts, despairing of taking the place by force, resolved to reduce it by famine. This task was rendered impracticable, by the vigilance and activity of the earl of Lancaster, who, though his forces were not sufficient to hazard a battle with the French, found means to intercept their convoys of provision; so that the immense army of the besiegers was grievously distressed. What ag∣gravated John's chagrin, was a rash vow he had made, to continue the siege until the town should capitulate. He therefore struggled with a variety of difficulties, till he received the news of Edward's landing in Normandy; then he made one general effort in an assault with his whole army, which lasted from morning till night, when he was obliged to desist, after having sustained consi∣derable damage: by this time his father commanded him to relinquish the en∣terprize, and even obtained the pope's absolution, with respect to the vow which he so religiously observed. Thus released, he raised the siege on the twentieth day of August, and retired with such precipitation, that great part of his tents and equipage was left behind. Sir Walter de Manny, having obtained a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Avesbury<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Froissart.</NOTE> safe∣conduct from the duke for himself and his followers, set out immediately for Calais, to join the army commanded by Edward; and the earl of Lancaster, no sooner understood that the duke of Normandy had retreated towards Paris, than he made an irruption into the Agenois: there he reduced Villareal, re∣covered Tonneins, and subdued several other fortresses; then he marched to∣wards

<P>The English people were so transported with the news of the glo∣rious victory which their king had obtained at Crecy, that they forgot the burthen of the heavy taxes under which they laboured, and chearfully resolved to grant what farther subsidies should be found necessary for the prosecution of the war. The parliament assembled by prince Lionel, on the eleventh day of September, being made acquainted with the particulars of the battle, and pre∣se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted with a paper found in the archives of Caen, containing the proposals of the Normans for the invasion and conquest of England, they forthwith granted an aid of two fifteenths and tenths, to be levied in two years for the service of his majesty. Being asked from the throne if they wanted the redress of any grievances, they presented some petitions to the clerk of the parliament; and they received satisfaction in a statute, enacting, that merchants importing false money, should be punished as false coiners; that persons contributing to the defence of the coast, should not be obliged to furnish arms and other warlike necessaries for the land-service; that justices of the peace and sheriffs should be chosen from among the chief freeholders of every country; and that no grants, either for life or in fee, should be made of those offices. The com∣mons likewise moved, that all monks and friars who were aliens, should be obliged to quit the realm; that the pensions granted to cardinals, and the abbot of Clugny, should be abolished; that aliens promoted to livings in this kingdom, the greater part of whom consisted of taylors, shoemakers, and ve∣nial retainers to cardinals, should be deprived and exi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and their benefices given to poor English scholars.

<P>Before Edward embarked upon his last expedition, the Scots, whose king was entirely devoted to the French interest, invaded Westmore∣land, under the command of Sir Alexander Strahan and some other officers, and reduced Penrith, with several other towns, to ashes. But the bishop of Car∣lisle, with Sir Thomas Lucy, and Sir Robert Ogle, having assembled a body of forces, harrassed them in such a manner, that they were fain to retreat with precipitation; and Sir Alexander, with a party of foragers, was taken pri∣soner. Ogle was for his valour on this occasion, appointed governor of Cum∣berland; and as Edward employed his whole attention in preparing for his

descent upon France, he consented to a truce with the king of Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrrel.</NOTE> The lords Mowbray, Ross, and Sir Thomas Lucy, were sent as commissioners to compromise all differences between the two kingdoms; and if we may be∣lieve the Scottish historians, Edward offered to purchase a solid peace with that nation, by giving up Berwick and renouncing Baliol. These proposals are far from being improbable, if we consider how eager the king of England was to exert his whole strength against Philip de Valois, and the experience he had of the difficulty that must have attended the intire conquest of Scotland, which in his own reign, as well as in that of his grandfather, had risen with fresh vigour from every overthrow, and always indemnified itself at the expence of England. Though David Brus consented to a suspension of hostilities he did not relish a treaty, and absolutely refused to detach himself from the king of France, who had protected him in his adversity. He concluded that Edward sought only to amuse him until he should have humbled a more powerful ad∣versary, that he might subdue Scotland at his leisure, when she would have no ally upon whose assistance she could depend. The Scottish nation seems to have been of the same opinion: for the parliament of that kingdom approved of his design to invade England, which was now unfurnished of her best troops; and the French encouraged the resolution, in hope that it would make an effectual diversion in favour of their monarch, who had not as yet recol∣lected himself from his defeat at Crecy.</P>

<P>Thus instigated, David, in the month of October, entered England, at the head of fifty thousand men, took Lidel by assault, and put the garrison to the sword, exacted heavy contributions from the monks and church of Durham, levied a capitation tax from all persons without distinction, ra∣vaged the country, and committed numberless barbarities. The queen consort was no sooner informed of this invasion than she set out for the north, to en∣courage the lords of the Marches to do their duty; and in a little time a consi∣derable army was assembled at York, from whence it advanced in four divi∣sions against the enemy, who were encamped in Bear-Park, at the distance of three miles from Durham. The first body was commanded by the lord Henry Percy, accompanied by the earl of Angus, the bishop of Durham, and several other noblemen of the north; the archbishop of York conducted the second division, having under his command the bishop of Carlile and the lord Nevil; the third body was led by the bishop of Lincoln, the lord Mow∣bray, and Sir Thomas Rokeby; and the rear was brought up by Edward Baliol, attended by the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord Ross, and the she∣riff of Northumberland. A great number of young noblemen and persons of distinction served as volunteers on this occasion, partly to express their zeal and loyalty in the king's absence, and partly to distinguish themselves under the eye of the queen, who took the field in person. The army consisted chiefly of stout borderers, inured to war and hardship, reinforced by a body of veterans whom Edward had sent over from France, and the whole, when they began their march, amounted to sixteen thousand men; but, in all proba∣bility the number was considerably increased, before they came in sight of the enemy, as so many noblemen must have been attended by a great concourse of vassals, in an expedition upon which the fate of the whole kingdom in a great measure depended. David Brus, apprized of their approach, detached
<PB N="60" REF="620"/>
a body of horse, under Douglas and Sir David Graham, to observe their mo∣tions and harrass them in their march; but they were so roughly handled by the English archers that they soon turned their backs, though very few of them escaped with their leaders; and this advantage the English deemed a happy omen of success. The Scottish army was formed into one line: the high steward of Scotland and the earl of March commanding on the right; the earls of Murray and Douglas being on the left wing; and David, with some French auxiliaries and the flower of his nobility, being stationed in the center. The English archers began the battle with showers of arrows on the left, which galled the Scots under the high steward in such a manner, that he ordered his division to charge sword in hand, and actually broke the bow∣men, who falling back upon the division commanded by the lord Percy, oc∣casioned great confusion and disorder. The enemy still pressed on with in∣credible impetuosity<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and victory had almost declared in their favour, when Baliol coming up, with four thousand choice horse at a round trot, fell upon the flank of the Scots, who had advanced beyond the rest of their line, and not only sustained the archers, who had given way, but also cut off the communication between the high steward and the main body where Brus commanded. Thus intercepted, and in great danger of being surrounded, he retreated in good order, while Baliol and the whole force of that wing attacked the centre of the Scots, now left exposed by the retreat of their left wing. Here the battle was maintained with great fury on both sides for a considerable time; at length the main body of the Scots gave way: then David refusing to quit the field, his nobles threw themselves into a circular form, and defended him with great gallantry, he himself fighting hand to hand with his enemies, until his followers were surrounded and partly slain, and David received two arrows in his body. Even when he was ready to sink, with the loss of blood, he dis∣dained to ask for quarter; nor would he receive it but at the hands of a gen∣tleman. At last he was made prisoner by John Coupland, after he had struck out two of that gentleman's teeth with his gauntlet. The left wing still con∣tinued to maintain their ground, under the command of Douglas and Murray, till this last was slain, and Douglas taken, after almost all his men had been cut in pieces. This victory would have decided the fate of Scotland, had not the high steward retired in good order, and been joined by the fugitives from the battle, so as to form a body which the victors did not think proper to pur∣sue. Nevertheless they left fifteen thousand men lying dead upon the spot, and among these Sir Thomas Charteris chancellor of Scotland, the lord cham∣berlain, Edward Keith earl mareschal, the earls of Murray and Stratherne, with several other noblemen, and a great number of persons of distinction. The earls of Fife, Monteith, Sutherland, Wigton, and Carrick, William lord Douglas, and many other personages of note, were among the prisoners. The king was conveyed by Coupland to Ogle-Castle in Northumberland, of which he was governor; and when the queen dispatched a pursuivant with orders to bring him Durham, he refused to deliver up his prisoner, because in those days the ransom belonged to the captor. He thought proper however to consign David Brus to his friend the lord Nevil, and take shipping imme∣diately for Calais, where he communicated the whole transaction to the king, who approved of his conduct, created him a knight baronet, and bestowed
<PB N="61" REF="630"/>
upon him a pension of five hundred pounds, until the same value in lands ad∣joining to his estate could be settled on him and his heirs for ever; he was or∣dered however to obey the commands of the queen, who arrived in person at the camp before Calais, after having provided for the safety of the kingdom, and left the care of the north to the lords Percy and Nevil, who took Hermi∣tage-Castle, and ravaged the whole county of Lothian. Coupland returning to England delivered the Scottish king to the sheriffs of Yorkshire, who con∣veyed him to the Tower of London. John Graham earl of Monteith, and Duncan earl of Fife, having formerly swore fealty to the king of England, and taken the oath to Edward Baliol as their immediate sovereign, were with∣out any trial condemned as traytors to be drawn, hanged, and beheaded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford.

<P>Mean while the garrison of Calais made a noble defence under John de Vienne, who repulsed the besiegers in all their assaults. Edward, seeing no prospect of reducing it by force, resolved to starve them into submis∣sion; and with that view, ordered huts to be built for the reception of his soldiers during the winter. He received supplies of men and provision from England; and a strong fleet blocked up the harbour, that the governor might receive no assistance by sea. John de Vienne, perceiving his drift, sent above seventeen hundred useless mouths out of the town; and Edward allowed them to pass through the camp without molestation, after he had ordered a small sum of money to be distributed among them for their immediate relief. During this blockade, the king of France endeavoured to detatch the Flemings from the interest of England, by offering to grant them great privileges in point of commerce, and to restore the towns he had wrested from them in the beginning of his reign. But they imputed these advances to the necessity of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 134<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> his affairs, and chose rather to depend upon the fortune of Edward, who had promised to recover those places by force of arms, immediately after the re∣duction of Calais; they even resolved to improve their connexion with England, by a marriage between Edward's eldest daughter Isabel and their young count, who had lost his father in the battle of Crecy, fighting in the service of France. This young prince had attained to the age of sixteen; and, having been edu∣cated in the French court, inherited his father's attachment to Philip as well as his aversion to the king of England. He had lately come to take possession of his county, and the Flemings, being bent upon this alliance, kept him in a kind of honourable confinement at Courtray, until he consented to their pro∣posal; then a league of perpetual amity was concluded between him and Ed∣ward, and the contracting powers agreed that the nuptials should be solem∣nized at Easter. As Lewis seemed intirely reconciled to the match, and even eager to consummate the alliance, the Flemings lest off watching him with their usual vigilance, and he took the first opportunity of escaping into France, where he was married to Margaret the daughter and heiress of the duke of Brabant. John, duke of Normandy, marching at the head of a numerous<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> army against the Flemings, invested Cassel; but he was obliged to abandon the siege at the approach of a body of forces, sent by Edward to the assistance of his allies. He then made an unsuccessful attempt on Lillers, and after∣wards
<PB N="62" REF="640"/>
advanced within two or three leagues of Calais; but the country being w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olly wasted, he was obliged to retire for want of subsistence. John de Vienne, finding himself every day more and more hampered by a scarcity of provi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, turned out five hundred inhabitants from the town; and Edward refusing to let them pass, they perished miserably by cold and famine, between the city and the camp of the besiegers, to the eternal reproach of Edward and the governor. The people of Calais were by this time reduced to the last ex∣trem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty; they had already eaten up all their horses, dogs, cats, and even rats, and now began to devour one another. Letters, sent by sea with an account of their deplorable condition, were intercepted by Edward, who for∣warded them to Philip, with a sarcastic message, desiring him to come with all speed to the relief of his distressed subjects. The French king had already appointed the rendezvous of his army at Amiens, where his vassals and allies assembled to the number of one hundred and fifty thousand men; but as the Flemings with a numerous army had undertaken the siege of Aire, and ra∣vaged the adjacent country, he postponed his march to Calais, and advanced against the less formidable enemy, who raised the siege and retired at his ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roach; then he turned off towards Calais, and, on the thirtieth day of July, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amped within a mile of Edward between Sangate and Witsand. The En∣glish camp being surrounded by impassable morasses, except on the side of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Downs of Sand, which was guarded by the navy lying at anchor on the coast, Philip sent four knights to tell the king of England that he would give him battle next Thursday, if he would come forth from his intrenchment and fight him on equal terms. To this message Edward replied, that he would not forego the advantages he had gained, or quit the post where he was certain of reducing the town of Calais, before which he had continued so long; but that it was Philip's business to force him to a battle if he could. That very day two cardinals arrived as mediators from the pope, and prevailed upon both kings to agree upon a truce for four days, that they might have time to settle the preliminaries of a treaty. During this suspension, Edward received a reinforcement of seventeen thousand Flemings and English; and then he sent a letter to Philip in his turn, offering to level all his entrenchments, and give him battle on plain ground, provided he would give security that no pro∣vision should in the mean time be conveyed into Calais. The French mo∣narch d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not think proper to embrace this proposal; and the negotiation mis∣carrying, he, on the second day of August, set fire to his tents and retired to Amiens, where he dismissed his army. Next day the governor of Calais de∣sired to capitulate; but Edward insisted upon his surrendering at discretion, that the garrison and inhabitants might be ransomed or punished according to his will and pleasure. It was at length <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tipulated that six of the principal burghers should come forth barefooted, with halters about their necks, and pre∣sent the keys of the town and castle to Edward, who should punish them as he thought proper, and receive all the rest into mercy. Eustace de St. Pierre and five of his fellow citizens offered themselves voluntarily, as sacrifices for the rest of the inhabitants; and in all probability they would have suffered death, had not the generosity of their behaviour affected queen Philippa, who interceded in their behalf, and obtained their pardon. The town of Calais being thus surrendered, after a siege of eleven months, Edward expelled all
<PB N="$3" REF="650"/>
the inhabitants and peopled it from England; and afterwards established in this place a staple for tin, lead and wool, which redounded greatly to the advantage of his subjects. We cannot help observing however that the inhabi∣tants<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rym<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</NOTE> of Calais had no great reason to extol the generosity of Edward, who seemed to persecute them for the courage and per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>everance they exerted in the defence of their country. Such behaviour even in this degenerate age would merit and obtain the favour of the conqueror.</P>

<P>While the king of England was employed in this memorable siege, Edward Baliol entered Scotland by the way of Carlile, at the head of twenty thousand men, and ravaged Galloway, Carrick, and the adjoining provinces, while the lord Percy, with an equal number of troops, made an irruption through Berwick, and wasted Lothian without opposition. These two armies joining, advanced towards Perth, with a view to over-run the whole kingdom; but the Scottish nobility purchased a truce of Baliol, till the eighth day of September, that they might have an opportunity to treat about the ransom of their king. Edward however would not receive their overtures on this subject, until they should have made satisfaction for the ravages they committed when David invaded England: and they were so exasp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed at this refusal, that they recommenced hostilities, and made incursions. The countess of Mont∣fort<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.</NOTE> took the field in Brittany, as soon as the tri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnial truce concluded for that province was expired, and reduced the for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ress of Roche de Rien. Charles de Blois immediately assembled an army at Nantes to recover the place, which he invested accordingly; but, before he had made great pro∣gress in the siege, his quarters were beaten up, his forces routed, and himself taken prisoner, by Tanneguy de Chastel and Garnier de Cadoudal, at the head of the troops belonging to the countess, reinforced by a body of English under the command of Sir Thomas Dagworth, whom Edward had detached to her assistance. Charles de Blois, as soon as his wounds were cured, was conveyed to England by this officer, in whose absence Roche de Rien was retaken by the partisans of Charles, who were joined by a strong body of French auxiliaries. But a stop was soon put to all those hostilities by a truce, which was mediated between the two crowns by the pope, to begin on the twenty-eighth day of September, and continue till the eighth of July in the succeeding year, including all the allies of the two kings in Brittany, Flanders, Guienne, and Scotland. It was afterwards renewed by several treaties in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer</NOTE> sequel, but it did not prevent Edward from taking proper measures to fortify the town and harbour of Calais, which being properly secured, and the inter∣nal police well regulated, he set sail with his queen and prince Edward for England; and after a dangerous passage landed on the twelfth day of October at Sandwich, from whence he proceeded immediately to London.</P>

<P>The emperor Lewis of Bavaria dying about this period, a dispute ensued among the electors touching the choice of a successor, and the imperial crown was offered to Edward by the archbishop of Mentz, at the head of a powerful faction. But the king declined their offer, as incompatible with his scheme upon France, and likely to engage him not only in a quarrel with the pope, who supported the pretensions of Charles, elected by another party of the German princes, but also in a distant war, the expence of which he was not able to maintain.

The French monarch made such preparations by sea and land, as seemed to threaten an invasion of England; and Edward re∣ceived a very large aid from the counties and boroughs, on condition that the merchants should be called to account for defrauding the king of two thirds of the loan of twenty thousand sacks of wool; that David Brus and the Scot∣tish prisoners should not be ransomed nor released; that the duty of forty shil∣lings a sack upon wool should cease in three years; that no talliage, impost, or loan should be levied without the assent of the commons in parliament; that the king should repay the wool he had borrowed; that the aid for the mar∣riage of his eldest daughter should be suspended during the exaction of this subsidy, a certain part of which should not be raised in case of a peace or long truce with France. These conditions were entered on record in the roll of parliament; and Edward began to prepare for another expedition, which how∣ever was prevented by a prolongation of the truce.</P>

<P>This agreement did not hinder Philip from tampering with Emeric of Pavia, whom the king of England had left governor of Calais. A private contract was carried on with this perfidious Lombard, by Geffrey de Charny, commander of the French forces in the neighbourhood of St. Omer; and he promised, for the consideration of twenty thousand golden crowns, to deliver the town and castle into his hands at midnight, on the thirty-first day of December. Edward being informed of this bargain by Emeric's secretary, sent for that officer to London, and pardoned his treachery, on condition that he would still proceed in his negotiation with Charny, that he might have an opport<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nity to surprize them in the violation of the truce. The French gene∣ral having assembled with great privacy a thousand chosen men at arms, with a proportionable body of infantry, began his march, and arriving at the bridge of Nieulaye at the time appointed, sent two messengers to the postern of the castle, where they found the governor, who assured them that every thing was prepared for their reception. Then he transmitted the twenty thousand crowns to Emeric, by the hands of Sir Edward de Renty; and detached twelve knights, with an hundred men at arms, to take possession of the castle. Mean while he himself passed the bridge, with the rest of his forces, and took post before the gate of Boulogne, resolving to enter the town with his banners dis∣played. Edward had by this time crossed the sea, with eight hundred men at
<PB N="65" REF="670"/>
arms, and a thousand archers, under the command of Sir Walter de Manny, and entered the harbour at night so privately, that no body in the town knew of his arrival. He took post immediately in the donjon or great tower that commanded the rest of the citadel; and when the French were admitted at the postern, rushed out unexpectedly, and took them all prisoners: then mount∣ing on horseback, he proceeded to the town, and making a sally at the gate of Boulogne, fell with great fury upon Charny, who neverthele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s made a gal∣lant defence, and maintained his ground till after day broke. In this action the king himself was on foot, and fought hand to hand with Eustace de Ribaumont, who, after having twice staggered Edward with the force of his blows, was at length obliged to yield himself his prisoner. Charny, with those who survived, seeing their retreat by the bridge of Nieulaye cut off by another detachment, and the English continually reinforced by fresh parties from the town, surrendered at discretion; and being conducted into Calais were magnificently entertained in the castle-hall by Edward, who then first discovered to them that he himself had been present in the engagement. He declared Ribaumont the bravest knight he had ever encountered, presented him with a rich chaplet of pearls, and set him at liberty without ransom. He then removed Emeric from the government of Calais, which he bestowed upon Sir John Beauchamp, and returned to England, where he amply re∣warded those who had signalized themselves upon this occasion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.</NOTE></P>

<P>The plague, which at the latter end of summer, broke out in the west of England, had by this time reached London; and therefore the parliament, which had been summoned to meet in January, was prorogued until that calamity should abate, though it raged for two years, during which no session was held nor any court of justice kept open. In the first six months of this year seven and fifty thousand persons are said to have died of the plague in Norwich and London; and the Church-yards being found too small for the burial of the dead, Sir Walter de Manny purchased a piece of ground, be∣longing to St. Bartholomew's hospital in Smithfield, to serve for the interment of those who were carried off by the pestilence, which no sooner ceased, than he founded on the spot a convent of Carthusians. This dreadful visitation spread into Wales and Ireland, and raged chiefly among the common people, and of these the old men, women, and children. None of the better sort died of the infection, except three or four of the nobility, and Jane the king's second daughter, who was infected at Bourdeaux in her way to Castile, where she was to have been married to the infant Don Pedro, son of Alphonso XI. sovereign of that kingdom. When the contagion among the human species abated, the sheep and cattle perished in vast numbers; and no bird or beast of prey would touch their carcasses, which lay putrifying upon the surface of the ground. The harvest was lost for want of hands to gather it, and hence fol∣lowed a dreadful dearth of labour and provision.

During these transactions, a petty war was still maintained in Brittany between the partisans of Charles de Blois and those of the countess, whose mutual enmity was habituated into a settled rancour that appeared on every opportunity of gratifying their revenge. In the progress of one of these feuds the lord Dagworth was surprised and slain, and Sir Walter de Benteley sent over in his room to command the English forces in Brittany.</P>

<P>About this period, Philip de Valois dying at Nogent le Rotrou, was succeeded on the throne of France by his son John duke of Normandy, who seemed to inherit his father's animosity against Edward; and this de∣scended even to objects unworthy of a great king's attention. Thomas de la Marche, an illegitimate son of France, who served in the army of the king of Sicily, being accused by John Visconti of knowing and concealing the conspiracy which Leonard de Assisi had hatched against their monarch, he not only denied the charge, but proposed to maintain his innocence in single com∣bat at the court of Edward, who was universally allowed to be the flower of chivalry. The duel was accordingly fought at Whitehall, in presence of the English court. The combatants having shivered their spears on horseback, alighted and fought on foot with great fury, until closing, Visconti fell to the ground; but he was so cased in armour that his antagonist could not make use of his advantage any other way than by driving the rowels of his spurs through the grated work of Viconti's visor. Thus incommoded he called out for quarter, and owned himself vanquished; and Edward dismissed the victor with an honourable testimony of his innocence and bravery. When he re∣turned to France, he found John incensed at his conduct, in appealing to a prince who was his professed rival, and still more exasperated at the praises which he bestowed upon Edward for his generosity and equitable determination. He pined with envy at the reputation of the English monarch; and this low jealousy prompted him to an action of cruelty and injustice, which left an un∣delible stain upon his character. Ralf de Brienne constable of France, who was dismissed from England on his parole to raise money for h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s ransom, join∣ing Thomas in his eulogiums on Edward, John took such umbrage at the pa∣negyri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he resolved to sacrifice him to his envy. Perhaps he really sus∣pected him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f that collusion with the king of England which he afterwards charged upon his memory.

<P>In this season of inactivity, Henry duke of Lancaster, accom∣panied by the lord Roos, and other persons of distinction, went abroad to sig∣nalize their courage in Prussia against the infidels, who had attacked the knights of the Teutonic order: but in their passage through Germany they were ar∣rested and detained in prison, from whence they were not released, until they had paid three thousand crowns by way of ransom. Their journey was after∣wards stopped by the news of a truce concluded between the powers at war; so that they returned by the way of Cologn, where Lancaster declared, that Otho duke of Brunswick had been the contriver of his imprisonment, which he mentioned as a perfidious scheme altogether unworthy of a man of honour. Otho, being apprized of this declaration, sent a challenge to Henry, defying him to single combat, in any place which the king of France should appoint. Lancaster accepted the proposal, and having obtained a safe-conduct, hastened to Paris, whither his antagonist repaired at the same time. Endeavours were used to compromise the quarrel; and these proving ineffectual, the day of com∣bat was appointed. When the combatants entered the lists, Otho's courage seemed to fail him: for he turned remarkably pale, mounted his horse re∣luctantly, dropped his shield three times successively, and appeared so discon∣certed, that his friends would not suffer him to engage under such trepidation. They therefore proposed that both parties should desist: but Lancaster would agree to no other terms, except the alternative of Brunswick's either fighting, or acknowledging himself to be vanquished.

<P>Had John consulted his interest only, he would have looked upon this as a very unseasonable juncture, for engaging in a war that might en∣courage and support Charles king of Navarre, in his endeavours to embroil the kingdom of France. That prince was nearly related to the French king, and had been educated at the court of his father Philip, where he soon displayed very extraordinary talents, and acquired great popularity by his insinuating manners and exquisite address. King John had endeavoured to attach him firmly to his interest, by giving him his daughter Jane in marriage: but he was of a character which no obligations could bind or influence. He trumped up a claim to the count<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of Champagne and Brie, as well as to the dutchy of Burgundy, in right of his mother; but as this claim was not allowed, he complained that the county of Engoulesme, which he enjoyed by a grant of Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les the Fair, was of no advantage to him, as being continually wasted by the English; and he received in lieu of it the towns of Mante and Meulant, which b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing added to the counties of Evreux and Mortagne, which he already possessed in Normandy, rendered him very power<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul in that province. En∣go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesme was bestowed upon John's favourite, Charles de la Cerda constable of France, whom the king of Navarre considered as his most inveterate enemy; he therefore hired ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ians to assassinate that nobleman, and even published a mani<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esto to justify this scandalous act of barbarity. At the same time he treated with the duke of Lancaster for assistance from England, and began to
<PB N="71" REF="730"/>
put himself in a posture of defence against the resentment of king John, who he did not doubt would endeavour to revenge the death of his minion. How mortified soever the French king must have been at this outrage committed against his person, honour, and authority, his affairs were in such an unfavour∣able situation, that he was obliged to smother his indignation, and even comply with all the proposals of the king of Navarre, who demanded a grant of several counties, viscounties, bailliages, privileges, and exemptions, together with a full pardon for himself and all those who were concerned in the murder of the constable. In return for these concessions, he offered to ask pardon of John before the parliament at Paris; though he would not even consent to make this satisfaction, until the king's second son, the count of Anjou, was delivered up as an hostage for the security of his person; then the ceremony was performed, and an ample pardon passed in form for the king of Navarre and all his adherents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. d'Evreux.</NOTE></P>

<P>Notwithstanding this seeming reconciliation, they suspected the sincerity of each other; and Charles still resolved to guard against the conse∣quence of John's hatred, by engaging in a firm alliance with England. The duke of Lancaster being then at Avignon treating with the French deputies, Charles took that city in his road to Navarre, and had several private con∣ferences with the English ambassador, concerning the measures to be taken in concert with Edward, when the truce should expire at Midsummer. John<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1355.</NOTE> suspecting his design, took this opportunity of his absence, to seize his towns and fortresses in Normandy, all of which surrendered without resistance, except Evreux, Gavre, Mortagne, Pont Audemer, Cherbourg, and Avranches, which, being well supplied with strong garrisons, refused the king of France admittance. Charles, being informed of these hostilities, sent an agent to the French court to justify his conduct, and demand a safe-guard, by virtue of which he might go thither in person. John readily granted this request; but at the same time sent his son Charles the dauphin into Normandy with a body of troops, to prevent all disturbances in that province. The king of Navarre did not think proper to make use of his safe-conduct, but landed in August with two thousand men at Cherbourg; and the garrison of Evreux, animated by the tidings of his arrival, took the castle of Conches by surprize. The duke of Athenes and Geffrey de Charny threw themselves into Caen, which seemed to be exposed to the greatest danger; and a strong body of troops was sent thither under the command of the constable of Bourbon, who neverthe∣less was enjoined to abstain from hostilities, and if possible effect an accommo∣dation. Such was now the posture of John's affairs, that he thought he could not purchase it at too dear a rate. The truce between the two crowns was by this time expired; and Edward had been so often deluded with vain hopes, that he seemed averse to its being renewed. The duke of Lancaster was ac∣tually at sea with forty stout ships, having on board a good number of troops destined for Cherbourg, which, however, he was prevented from reaching by contrary winds. The prince of Wales commanded a strong body of forces on the western coast of England, and a fleet lay ready at Plymouth to trans∣port them to the continent: so that John could not make too much dispatch in accomodating matters with the king of Navarre, who was determined to join the English in Normandy. He therefore offered one hundred thousand crowns

in lieu of all the demands of Charl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, who was glad to make peace upon such advantageous terms.

<P>The duke of Lancaster, apprised of this reconciliation, and understanding the coast of Normandy was guarded by a numerous body of forces, laid aside his design of a descent, and was afterwards appointed lieute∣nant for the king in Brittany: but the prince of Wales, having embarked his forces on board of a fleet of three hundred ships, set sail in September from Plymouth, acco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>panied by the earls of Warwick, Oxford, Salisbury, Suf∣folk, and other persons of distinction; and landing at Bourdeaux, was joined by the most considerable of the Gascon nobility. Finding himself, in conse∣quence of this junction, at the head of an army consisting of threescore thou∣sand men, he began his march, on the fifth day of October, towards Ar∣magnac, which together with Astarac, Cominges, La Riviere, and L'Isle-en∣Jourdain, he ravaged with fire and sword; plundering the inhabitants, dis∣mantling their fortresses, and laying the towns and villages in ashes. Then he advanced to Thoulouse, where the French army, exceeding his own in num∣ber, was encamped, under the command of the counts of Armagnac and Foix, the prince of Orange, the constable of Bourbon, and the marechal de Cler∣mont. After having essayed in vain to provoke them to a battle, he passed the Garonne above the city, and burned all the fine towns in the neighbourhood. From thence he advanced to Avigonet, which, together with several other im∣portant places, he took and destroyed; and in a word, intirely ruined one of the most rich and fertile countries in France. The inhabitants of Montpelier burned their suburbs, in expectation of being besieged; and the pope, who resided at Avignon, sent ambassadors to the prince of Wales, with proposals for setting on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot another treaty: but he would not even admit them to an audience; though he referred them to his father, who was at that time in the neighbour∣hood of Calais. Innocent, affronted and alarmed at the little respect shewn to his deputies, began to fortify his palace, and detached his marechal with five hundred men at arms, furnished by the cardinals and gentry of the country around, to observe the motions of the English. This officer, advancing too near the prince's army, was defeated and taken, and obliged to pay fifty thou∣sand crowns for his ransom. Young Edward had already, in the space of eight weeks, destroyed five hundred villages and many fortified towns; and would have continued this work of desolation, had not he received intelligence that the Fre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch army had quitted Tholouse, in order to come and give him battle. He forthwith marched back to meet them; but as he approached they retired towards Tholouse, though he did not know the route they had taken. He passed the river at Carbonne, where he understood they were within two leagues of his army; and a detachment of his troops beating up part of their quarters, they retreated with precipitation to Lombez and Sauve∣terre, posting themselves behind the Sauve, as if they intended to dispute the passage of that river. Edward following them thither, found all the bridges broken down; and while he was employed in repairing them, the French re∣tired to Gimont, though not so expeditiously but that the van of the English
<PB N="73" REF="750"/>
intercepted part of their rear, which was cut in pieces. He arrived with his whole army in the neighbourhood of the place in the evening, and next day drew up his forces in order of battle; but the enemy had marched off in the night, leaving a strong garrison in the town, which was well provided for making an obstinate defence. The season of the year being by this time too far advanced to admit of his undertaking the siege with any prospect of success, he returned to Bourdeaux, and distributed his forces into winter-quarters, under commanders of approved valour, who, notwithstanding the severity of the wea∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.

<P>While the prince of Wales proceeded with this rapidity of con∣quest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

In this expedition he was attended by his sons Lionel and John of Ghent, Henry duke of Lancaster, the earls of Northamp∣ton, March, and Stafford, the lords Percy, Manny, and Graystock, the bishop of Durham, and a great number of barons from the north; the border being secured by a truce granted to the Scots, at their own request. When Edward landed at Calais, he was joined by one thousand men at arms, under some German, Brabantine, and Flemish knights, whom he had re∣tained in his service; and this reinforcement, added to the troops he carried over from England, constituted a considerable army, at the head of which he marched, on the second day of November, towards St. Omer, where the French king lay encamped with his forces. That prince sending a knight, who had formerly been a prisoner in England, with a frivolous message to the king, that he might have an opportunity to observe the English army, Edward allowed him to take a full view of the troops, and the disposition he had made; and the knight made such a report of them to his master, that John thought proper to retire from St. Omer, after having destroyed all the provi∣sions in the adjacent country. Edward followed him as far as Hesdin, but was obliged to return to Calais for want of subsistence; and next day some French knights came to propose a pitched battle on the Tuesday following. The king accepted the proposal, on condition that these knights would engage to bring their master to the field at the appointed time; or, in default of his coming, yield themselves prisoners of war. The English nobility offered to be bound for the appearance of Edward in the same penalty; but the French declined the expedient: so that the king, after having waited all day on Tues∣day in expectation of their coming, dismissed his foreign troops, and returned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.

<P>His return was hastened by the conduct of the Scots, who, disregarding the truce, had taken the town of Berwick by surprize, in the absence of the northern nobility, and were employed in preparations for invading England. In a parliament convened at Westminster, on the twenty-third day of November, the lord Manny explained the transaction of the treaty of Calais; the proposal of a league with the king of Navarre; the particulars of the king's last expedition; and his design to recover Berwick, and carry the war into the heart of Scotland. For these purposes the commons granted a greater subsidy on wool, wool-fells, and leather, than any parlia∣ment

It was to be continued for six years, and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> amounted to one million five hundred thousand pounds annually. Some re∣gulations being made with respect to juries, and other grievances of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion redressed, Edward began to prepare for his northern expedition, and appointed the rendezvous of his forces at Newcastle. He himself set out im∣mediately for the same place; and the Scots being apprized of his approach, abandon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Berwick, which was not tenable while the English possessed the castle. The king, advancing as far as Haddington, burned the towns and villages, but saw not the face of an enemy; for the Scottish forces had retired to their woods and mountains, after having removed all their provisions and effects from the lowlands, that the English might not find the least subsistence. This was a very prudent precaution; for Edward's fleet being dispersed in a storm, he found himself destitute of provisions, and was obliged to re∣turn immediately to Roxburgh. In that place Edward Baliol, now grown old and overwhelmed with infirmities, resigned his title to the crown of Scot∣land in favour of the English monarch, who, in consideration of this cession, granted him a pension of two thousand pounds a year for life, payed all his debts, and presented him with a gratuity of five thousand marks, as a recom∣pence<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1356.</NOTE> for his faithful services. After this transaction, the king returned to Lon∣don in February, where he received a considerable aid from the prelates and the clergy; and, about this period, the earl of Northampton concluded a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> truce with the Scots till Michaelmas.</P>

<P>Mean while preparations were carrying on in France for the maintenance of a vigorous war. About the latter end of November, John called an assembly of the estates at Paris; and, for the first time, the towns were ordered to send deputies to this convention. Here the members, ap∣pearing extremely zealous for the glory of their king, undertook to maintain t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irty thousand men at arms for one year, and consented to a gabelle upon falt, a duty on all kinds of provision, and a capitation-tax upon all persons in the kingdom without distinction. These impositions produced an insurrection at Arras, and furnished the king of Navarre with an handle to diffuse the spirit of disaffection through the whole province of Normandy. He had already debauched the dauphin from his duty, and persuaded him to quit his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather's court in resentment, because he had as yet received no independent provision: but John, by wise remonstrances, and gratifying his son with the dukedom of Normandy, prevailed upon him to abandon this seducer of his youth, and even to assist in a design he had formed to seize the king of Na∣varre, and all the lords of his party. The dauphin still pretending the warmest affection for Charles and his partisans, with whom he had been so lately engaged, invited them to an entertainment at Rouen; and, while they sat at table in the castle, John, who had privately arrived with a small num∣ber of troops, suddenly entered the hall, and ordered all the guests to be ap∣prehended. The count of Harcourt, with the lord of Graville, and two gentlemen, were immediately beheaded; and the king of Navarre was sent to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Paris, from whence he was afterwards removed to Arleux in Artois, where he remained in close confinement. His brother Philip d'Ev∣reux count of Longueville, incensed at his imprisonment; and Godfrey de Harcourt, exasperated at the execution of his nephew, vowed revenge against
<PB N="75" REF="770"/>
the tyrant, fortified all the places in their power, and sent to England for succours. King Edward understanding that Charles had suffered on account of a pretended league with England, sent a manifesto to several courts, vin∣dicating him from that aspersion; and detached Miles lord Stapleton, with a body of troops, to assist in the defence of his possessions in Normandy, where the French forces had already reduced Evreux, and invested Pontaudemer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.</NOTE> But these being too inconsiderable to withstand the power of France, Henry duke of Lancaster was sent thither with another reinforcement; and, landing at La Hogue, was joined by the count of Longueville and Godfrey de Har∣court, who had by this time done homage at the court of England to Edward, as the lawful king of France. Lancaster being at the same time reinforced by Sir Robert Knolles, with some troops from Brittany, found himself at the head of nine hundred men at arms, and fourteen hundred archers, besides a strong body of infantry. With these he raised the siege of Pontaudemer, as well as that of Breteuil, and reduced Vernueil; then marching in sight of the French army, amounting to forty thousand men, commanded by the duke of Orleans, he encamped near L'Aigle, and returned in July to Montebourg. The affairs of Brittany requiring Lancaster's presence in that province, the command of the forces in Normandy devolved to the count of Longueville and Godfrey de Harcourt, who exerted themselves vigorously in the prosecution of the war; but, being greatly inferior to the enemy in number, they could not prevent Tillieres and Breteuil from being taken by Robert de Clermont, marechal to the duke of Normandy. After the reduction of these places, he fell into the Cotentin; on the tenth day of November, he surprized Godfrey de Harcourt, who was cut in pieces, together with his whole de∣tachment of seven hundred men, near Coutances: and, as he died without issue, the honour of St. Sauveur le Vicomte <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the king of England, who afterwards bestowed it upon John lord Chandos. This disaster was fol∣lowed by the reduction of Pont de l'Arche; which, after a brave defence for four months, was surrendered on the fourth day of December: but these losses were in some measure repaired by the reduction of the castle of Evreux, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<HEAD>§ LXXXII.</HEAD>
<P>During these transactions, Edward prince of Wales having re∣duced the greatest part of the Agenois in the winter, and sufficiently refreshed his soldiers after the fatigues of such a severe campaign, began his march from Bourdeaux, on the sixth day of July, at the head of two thousand men at arms, six thousand archers, and four thousand infantry. Passing through the Agenois, he ravaged Quercy, the Limousin, and Auvergne; fell into Berry, attempted Issodun and Bourges without success, and took Vierzon by assault. Here he first understood that the French king lay encamped at Chartres, with a prodigious army collected from all parts of his kingdom. Suspecting that Edward intended to pass the Loire, and join the duke of Lan∣caster in Normandy, he had disposed his troops in such a manner as to guard all the towns and passages on that river; and the prince of Wales being in∣formed of this disposition, resolved to turn off on the left to Romarantin, ravage Poitou, and return through Saintonge to Bourdeaux. Three hundred lances, under the command of the lords of Craon and Boucicaut, in attempt∣ing
<PB N="76" REF="780"/>
to c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t off his advanced guard, were defeated, and fled to the castle of Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, where, in a few days, they were obliged to surrender at discre∣tion. The prince in his route had taken above six thousand men at arms, who were sent prisoners to Bourdeaux, and la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d waste a prodigious tract of country. Marching through part of Touraine and Anjou, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outh of the Loire, he now entered Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tou; and, on Saturday the seventeenth day of September, encamped between Beauvoir and Maupertuis, within two leagues of Poitiers. The king of France coming up with an army of sixty thousand horse, besides infantry, called a council of war, in which it was resolved to attack the English next morning. Edward was already so straitened for want of provisions, that, in a few days, he must have bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> starved into a surren∣der; but the French, confiding in their valour and the vast superiority of their numbers, demanded a battle so eagerly, that John did not think proper to disappoint their ardour and ambition. He divided his army into three bodies; of which the first and most advanced was commanded by his brother the duke of Orleans; the second was posted on the left, under the conduct of the dauphin, ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted by his brothers Lewis and John; while the king in per∣son, accompanied by his youngest son Philip, commanded the third division, as a body of reserve. This order being settled, John detached the lords of Ribaumont, La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>das, and Beaujeu, to view the countenance and disposition of the enemy, whom they found posted among bushes, hedges, and vineyards, so as to be inaccessible in every quarter, but by a narrow lane lined with hedges, behind which a body of English archers was planted to command the passage. Ribaumont advised the king to dismount all his cavalry, excep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> three hundred chosen men in complete armour, who should enter the defile, and make way for the attack of the dismounted cavaliers. In consequence of this advice, the three hundred men were armed for this service, and all the rest of the troops ordered to charge on foot, except a few German squadrons, which continued on horseback, to be occasionally employed according to the emergencies of the action. Just when John was going to begin the battle, the cardinal of Perigort, employed by the pope to renew the negotiations be∣tween the two crowns, running up to the king, conjured him to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pare the lives of so many French gentlemen, which would necessarily be lost in the attack, and allow him to repair to the English camp, where he did not doubt of being able to persuade the prince of Wales to surrender. Having obtained this pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mission, he hastened to Edward, who being very sensible of his dangerous situation, declared himself ready to accept of any terms that should be con∣sistent with his own honour and that of his country. When the cardinal re∣turned with this answer, John sent back his troops to their quarters; and the mediator spent the whole day in passing between the two camps, to settle the articles of accommodation. The prince of Wales offered to restore all the places and pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oners he had taken in that campaign; and abstain, for seven years, from carrying arms against the king of France, on condition of being allowed to retire unmolested to Bourdeaux. But John peremptorily insisted upon Edward's surrendering himself prisoner, with an hundred knight<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and in that case the English army should be permitted to retire without molesta∣tion. The prince, far from subscribing to this article, told the cardinal, that he and his knights should never be taken but in battle; and that he would
<PB N="77" REF="790"/>
rather lose his life than agree to such a proposal. Thus the negotiation was broke off, and both sides prepared for an engagement; though Edward de∣rived some advantage from this small respite, during which he had rendered his camp more defensible by means of ditches and pallisadoes. On Monday morning the French army appeared in the order of battle we have already de∣scribed; and Edward drew up his handful of troops in three divisions, ranged in a close compacted form, with hedges and ditches in his front, while his flanks were defended on one side by a mountain, and on the other by a morass. On the declivity of the hill the van was posted, under the command of the earl of Warwick; the rear was conducted by the earls of Salisbury and Suffolk; and the prince of Wales took his station at the end of the lane, to command the main body, which extended itself into a vineyard. John de Greilly, Captal de Buche, was detached with three hundred men at arms and as many archers, to form an ambush under cover of the trees, bushes, and broken ground, at the foot of the mountain, that he might fall upon the enemy's back in the heat of the action: and the open part of the ground, on which the English stood, was enclosed by the waggons of the army. About nine of the clock in the morning, the chosen body of men at arms entered the lane with great resolution; but they were so galled by the English archers that lined the hedges through which they passed, that one half of them fell before they reached the front of Edward's main body, where they were cut in pieces by the lord Audeley. The marechals Clermont and Andrehan, ad∣vancing close behind those men at arms, were greatly embarrassed by the horses and bodies of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain, which choaked up the passage, while the archers plied them without intermission. When they penetrated to the van of the English, they met with a very warm reception from the earl of Warwick; and Salisbury and Suffolk, advancing from the rear, completed their confu∣sion. Clermont was killed upon the spot, and Andrehan felled to the ground by the lord Audeley, who took him prisoner. The fate of these noblemen, and the slaughter that ensued, disconcerted their followers so much, that they fell into disorder, and fled with great precipitation. The first body of the French being thus routed, the dauphin advanced to the charge, though his men were already dispirited; but they had no sooner begun the attack, than John de Greilly rushing from his ambush, fell upon their rear with such fury, that they were immediately seized with consternation, and betook themselves to flight. Those noblemen who were particularly entrusted with the care of the dauphin's person, conveyed him from the field to Chavigny, under a guard of eight hundred lances; and the duke of Orleans, with the greatest part of his command, which had not yet engaged, thought proper to follow the same route. The prince of Wales seeing those two bodies broken and routed, immediately mounted his horse, and advanced at the head of his men at arms, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o attack the third division, commanded by John himself, who waited for him without flinching. Notwithstanding the impetuosity with which Edward began the charge, the battle was a long time maintained with equal valour on both sides, and dubious success, till Gauchet de Brienne duke of Athenes, and constable of France, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain; then his brigade gave way, and victory declared in favour of the English. The prince of Wales falling in among the German cavalry, routed them at the first onset, in which the
<PB N="78" REF="800"/>
count of Sarbruck was slain, and the count of Nassau taken prisoner. John king of France, attended by his son Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip, endeavoured to rally his troops, and animate them by his own example. He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought on foot with uncommon valour, until he was deserted by a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l his followers; and Dennis de Morhec, a knight of Artois, who had formerly been in his service, exhorting him to surrender without further opposition, he desired to see his cousin the prince of Wales: but as Edward chanced to be in another part of the field, he threw his gauntlet to Morhec, in signal of surrender. Mean while a party of English, and another of Gascon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, coming up, deprived him of his royal pri∣soner, about whom a dispute ensued, which might have been attended with f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al consequences to John and his son Philip, who shared his fate, had not the earl of Warwick and Reginald lord Cobham interposed, and conducted him to prince Edward, who had retired to his pavilion, where he reposed himself after the fatigue of the battle. Upon this occasion, the Black Prince exhibited all the heroism of virtue: he received the king of France with the utmost tenderness and respect; he comforted him under his disaster, by ob∣serving that success very often depends upon accident, that he had performed the part of a consummate general and undaunted hero; and that he had fallen into the hands of those who knew how to revere his virtues and misfortune. He expressed the most profound esteem, and even a warm affection, for the royal family of France, to which he had the honour of being related; and he promi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to exert all his influence with his father to promote an honourable peace, which should be for the advantage of both nations. He even waited upon him at supper, and could not be prevailed upon to sit down, notwith∣standing the intreaties of John, who bore his fate with unshaken fortitude; and expressed his satisfaction, that since he was doomed to captivity, he had the good fortune to be the prisoner of the most gallant prince in the universe. The French noblemen, who had been taken in the battle, were struck with astonishment and reverential awe at this instance of generosity and moderation. They looked upon him as a being of some superior species; and while they manifested their veneration for his great qualities, could not help lamenting the fate of their country, which was exposed to the resentment of an enemy, endowed with such extraordinary talents. The lord Audeley having signa∣lized his personal prowess above all the noblemen in the field, the prince de∣sired to see him; and he was brought dangerously wounded to his tent, where Edward highly extolled his valour, retained him as his knight, with a grant of five hundred marks a year out of his own inheritance; which bounty he forthwith distributed among his four esquires, who had fought by his side in the battle. Edward being informed of this particular, applauded his genero∣sity, confirmed the donation, and settled upon Audeley six hundred marks a<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> year ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the coinage of the stannaries of Cornwall. This great victory was gained without the loss of one person of distinction; whereas the French lost the flower of their nobility, who, rather than desert their sovereign, chose to die in his defence. Among those were the count of Dammartin, the lords of Rochefoucault, Mathas, La Tour, Montaign, Landas, Charny, and Ribaumont: Gucelard d'Angle was left for dead among the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain, but recovering of his wounds, he entered into the English service, was admitted a knight of the garter, and created earl of Huntingdon. Two dukes, nineteen
<PB N="79" REF="810"/>
counts, five thousand men at arms, and about eight <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> are said to have been killed on the French side in this batt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo thousand men at arms were taken prisoners; and among these the counts of Ponthi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u, Eu, and Tancarville, princes of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blood; the archbishop of Sens, the counts of Est<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpes a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Vaudemont, the lords of Parthenay, Rochechouart, Chaulny, and many other noblemen. The gates of Poitiers b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing shut upon the fugitives, lest their pursuers should enter the town with them pell-mell, such a multitude of prisoners were taken, that the victors dismissed great numbers on parole, at very easy ransoms, which were punctually payed. Every soldier of Edward's army was enriched with the spoils of the enemy and the ransom of the prisoners, which belonged to the captors, when it did not exceed ten thousand crowns; in which case it was the king's property. Next day prince Edward decamped, and, without undertaking the siege of Poitiers, retired with his prisoners and booty through Saintonge to Bourdeaux; while the dauphin hastening to Paris, assembled the three estates, to concert measures for the defence of the kingdom, and contribute their assistance to∣wards the ransom of their sovereign. Before the states would grant a supply, they took the advantag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their king's distress, to humble the power of the crown: they insisted upon the immediate removal of seven principal officers of state, as well as upon the release of the king of Navarre; they appointed a committee, consisting of twelve prelates, twelve noblemen, and the like number of burgesses, without whose advice the dauphin, who acted as lieu∣tenant of the realm, should take no step in the administration; and they de∣manded that all the grievances of the nation should be redressed. John being made acquainted with these transactions, desired the dauphin would by no means agree to such insolent demands; for he would rather continue prisoner to an honourable enemy, than return home as a slave to his own subjects. As the estates would not relax in their propositions, they were dissolved by the dauphin, who had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecourse to the city of Paris for an aid to maintain the war: but the inhabitants, instead of complying with his request, gave him to understand, that they were not obliged to pay any subsidy that was not im∣posed by the three estates, which they exhorted him to re-assemble. Such answers he received from all the provinces but Champagne and Languedoc, which he found more tractable.</P>

<P>POPE Innocent VI. had, upon hearing of John's being carried to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The duke of Lancaster, who had invested Rennes, was by an article of this agreement to raise the siege; but he refused to conform to this article, until the truce should be ratified by the king of England; and in the mean time carried on his operations with such redoubled vigour, that the inhabitants were glad to pay an hundred thousand crowns to indemnify him for the ex∣pence of the siege, and obliged themselves to receive a governor of his own chusing. After the ratification of this truce, prince Edward bought up all the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Knyghton.</NOTE> prisoners of distinction from the captors; and setting sail from Guienne on the twenty-fourth day of April, with the king of France and the other prisoners, attended by a large train of English and Gascon noblemen, two hundred men at arms, and two thousand archers, landed on the fifth day of May at Sand∣wich. When the tidings of the victory at Poitiers first arrived in England, the king, instead of encouraging revellings and demonstrations of joy, desired that the archbishop of Canterbury would appoint a whole week to be spent in prayer and thanksgiving, that he and the nation might not be too much in∣toxicated by their success. Notwithstanding this instance of his moderation and self-denial, he now directed the lord-mayor to prepare pageants, proces∣sions, and triumphal arches, to honour the public entrance of his victorious son, who was me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Southwark by the mayor and aldermen in their forma∣lities, with one thousand citizens on horseback. The royal prisoner rode thro' the streets of London in a magnificent habit, mounted on a fine white courser, and attended by the prince of Wales, on a little black horse with ordinary trap∣pings. The inhabitants vied with each other in displaying plate, tapestry, fur∣niture, and arms offensive and defensive, in their shops, windows, and bal∣conies. The streets were lined with an infinite concourse of people; and the cavalcade lasted from three in the morning till noon, when they reached West∣minster-hall, where the king of England sat upon a royal throne, in expecta∣tion of their coming. He rose up when John approached, and received him with all that courteous civility which might have been expected from a prince of his character. Then he embraced his son wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h great tenderness, and told him, that the victory did not please him so muc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as the modesty with which he had bore his good fortune.

<P>Immediately after John's public entrance, which must have been a very disagreeable ceremony to a vanquished king, the two cardinals arrived in England with some proposals of peace, which Edward <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound so unreasonable, that he would not even appoint commissioners to treat upon the subject. Find∣ing him averse to that negotiation, they demanded the arrears of the tribute which had been formerly payed to Rome; but the king rejected this demand as an obsolete chimera, and plainly told them, as he held his crown of God alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</NOTE> he would never pay tribute to any mortal whatsoever.

<P>Nothing could be more seasonable to the dauphin of France, than the truce concluded at Bourdea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x. His authority was not yet settled: the Navar∣rois had surprized Hon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eur; a body of French troops attempting to recover <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had been routed by Sir Robert Knolles; and Stephen Marcel, prevot de marchands in Paris, at the head of a mutinous populace, dem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded that the king of Navarre should be set at liberty, and the three estates reassembled. The dauphin, being averse to a compliance with either of these demands, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmoned deputies from seventy towns; but these pretending they had no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wer to raise subsidies, he was obliged to assemble the estates. About this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me, the king of Navarre escaping from the castle of Arleux, by the assistance o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> John de Pequigny governor o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Artois, made a public entry into Paris, where he was received by the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot with his off<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cers, and above ten thousand inhabitants in arms. He harrangued the populace from a scaffold, on the cruelty and injustice of his imprisonment; and became so formidable by his popularity, that the dauphin was fain to comply with all his demands. He gratified him with a sum of money, as a reparation of the injuries he had sus∣tained; he granted an amnesty to him and all his partisans; he promised to restore their forfeited estates; and issued orders for the restitution o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the places that belonged to him in Normandy. The governors, however, looking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon these orders as extorted by violence, refused to deliver up their charge:
<PB N="83" REF="850"/>
and the king of Navarre, complaining of this refusal as a breach of stipulation, retired to Normandy, where he began to levy troops, and foment disturbances against the government. The Parisians perceiving that the dauphin had levied troops in the provinces, made barricadoes in their streets, and fortified all the avenues of their city, which was divided into different factions. The prevot, at the head of the Navarrois, who distinguished themselves by party-coloured hats, exclaimed against the ministry, and loudly demanded the restitution of the places, according to the agreement made with the king of Navarre. They even carried their outrages so far as to assassinate Robert de Clermont, and John de Conflans, marechal of France and Burgundy, in the king's presence. The estates being assembled at Paris, instead of taking measures to repress these violences, demanded that the management of the finances should be put into the hands of the committee appointed in the last assembly; and that they should have the nomination of the persons that were to compose the council of state. The king of Navarre going to Paris, began to insinuate in his harrangues, his pretended right to the crown of France in right of his mother, who was daugh∣ter of Lewis Hutin; and at last formed a design to surprize the dauphin. This prince, who had hitherto acted only as the king's lieutenant, was now declared regent of the kingdom by the parliament; and repairing to Com∣piegne, convoked an assembly of the states, who complied with all his de∣mands, and granted subsidies for levying troops with all expedition. By this time, the noblesse of the provinces were exasperated against the Parisians, for the murder of the two marechals; and willingly contributed towards the ven∣geance of the dauphin, who, having assembled a body of forces, formed the blockade of Paris, while the king of Navarre encamped at St. Denis with his own troops and a reinforcement of English, who plundered both parties alike.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1358.</NOTE> The licentiousness of those auxiliaries provoked the Parisians to such a degree, that a great number of those who had been formerly attached to Charles of Navarre now declared for the dauphin; the prevot, in order to prevent a general defection, concerted a scheme with the Navarrois, to massacre all who adhered to the regent, and proclaim Charles of Navarre king of France. Marks were set upon the houses of those doomed to destruction. The first day of Au∣gust was appointed for the execution of this execrable design; and the troops of Navarre approached the gates of St. Honoré and St. Antoine in the night. A little before day-break, the prevot going to the Porte de St. Antoine, and finding some burgesses on guard, who were not privy to the design, he ordered them to deliver up the keys and return to their own homes, as their stay was no longer necessary. Some of these suspecting mischief, signified their doubts to John Maillard, who commanded in the next district; and he advancing with a party, opposed the orders of the prevot. A dispute arose, and some bit∣ter altercation ensuing, John slew the demagogue, with a number o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol∣lowers: then securing his partisans, whom the prevot had posted at the two gates, he assembled the people, and made them acquainted with the particu∣lars of the conspiracy, which by this time he had learned from the confession of those whom he had arrested. The populace were so exasperated at this infor∣mation, that they treated the dead body of the prevot with the utmost indig∣nity, inveighed against the king of Navarre, and called aloud for the regent's return. Two counsellors were accordingly deputed to invite him to the city,

The king of Na∣varre, seeing all his measures defeated, sent an open defiance to the dauphin and the Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians; and he maintained a bloody war with his own forces and a body of Gascons, whom his kinsman the captal de Buche had brought to his<NOTE PLACE="marg">F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt.

<P>The truce between France and England was prolonged from April to Midsummer, at the intercession of the pope, who thought by that time all dif∣ferences<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1359.</NOTE> between the two monarchs might be amicably compromised. They had already signed a treaty of peace at London, upon the following conditions: That, in consideration of Edward's quitting all claim to the dutchy of Nor∣mandy, the counties of Anjou and Maine, and the crown of France, he and his heirs should enjoy Gascony, Guienne, L'Engoumois, Saintonge, Perigort, Quercy, Limosin, Foictou, Touraine, Calais, Guisnes, the Boulonnois, and county of Ponthieu, intirely independent of the kingdom of France: And that John, with the French noblemen who had been taken prisoners, should be set at liberty, on the payment of four millions of gold crowns for his and their ransom. This treaty being considered in an assembly of the estates of France, was rejected as incompatible with the honour and safety of the king∣dom; and Edward, incensed at their refusal, threatened to visit the dauphin at Paris, as soon as the truce should be expired. The regent, that he might be the better prepared for his reception, compromised his dispute with the king of Navarre and the count of Harcourt; though Philip count of Longueville would not accede to this accommodation. Being possessed of many castles in Normandy, Picardy, and Champagne, he continued hostilities, with the assist∣ance of a number of English knights, who, though they had no commissions <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the king, took this opportunity of enriching themselves with plunder.</P>

<P>Edward had begun to make mighty preparations for invading France; and his design was no sooner known abroad, than a multitude of knights, with their followers, repaired to his standard at Calais, from Germany, Brabant, and the Low-Countries: so that the place being exceedingly crouded, a scar∣city of provisions ensued, and this was attended with many disorders. To re∣move these inconveniencies, Henry duke of Lancaster went over in September with a body of forces, and taking the field advanced to Cerisy on the Sommé, where he continued encamped, until he heard of the king's arrival from Eng∣land. Edward landed on the twenty-eighth day of October at Calais, with an army of one hundred thousand men, transported in eleven hundred sail of ships, together with a vast quantity of provisions for their subsistence. He was at∣tended by the Black Prince and three other sons, namely Lionel of Antwerp earl of Ulster, John of Ghent earl of Richmond, and Edmund of Langely; the earls of Warwick, Marche, Hereford, Suffolk, Stafford, Salisbury, and Northampton, the lords Percy, Neville, D'Espenser, Chandos, Manny, Cobham, Mowbray, Delawarre, Grey of Codenore, Audeley, Basset, Char∣leton, and Fitzwalter; and the king's fifth son Thomas of Wodestoke, though a child, was left guardian of the kingdom, under the direction of a council. On the fourth day of November, Edward began his march from Calais, in two divisions, one of which the prince of Wales commanded; and being joined by the duke of Lancaster, continued his progress in spite of deep roads and rainy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eather, through Artois and Picardy, till he reached the neighbourhood of
<PB N="85" REF="870"/>
Rheims in Champagne, where the kings of France were generally crowned. Here he proposed to be invested with the royal diadem of France; and the bishop of Lincoln and Durham attended him, in order to perform the cere∣mony: but the place was so well secured with fortifications and a strong garri∣son, that he did not think proper to invest it in form, but kept it blocked up till the beginning of Lent, and in the mean time reduced some small fortresses in the neighbourhood. In the beginning of the year, he marched towards<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1360.</NOTE> Troyes, and entering Burgundy took the town of Tonnere, though he could not reduce the castle: thence he proceeded to Montreal, Avallon, and Guillon, where Philip duke of Burgundy purchased a truce for three years, at the price of one hundred thousand nobles, payed under the name of a consideration for the restitution of Flavigny, which had been taken by some English adven∣turers. Edward, advancing to Clamecy, granted a like composition to the people of the Nivernois; then ravaged all the Gatenois and Brie, and com∣ing in sight of Paris on the last day of March, fixed his head-quarters at Bourg∣la-Reine, from whence his army extended to Lonjumeau, and as far as Cor∣beil. A treaty was again set on foot by the pope's mediation, but proved as fruitless as the former; and the king advancing towards the Faubourg S. Marcel, chall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ged the dauphin to battle, offering to quit all claim to the crown of France, should he be defeated. This proposal being rejected, the weather extremely cold, and the ground destitute of forage, he made an un∣successful attempt upon the suburbs, and began his march next day for Bre∣tagne, from whence he proposed to return in July or August, and undertake the siege of Paris in form.</P>

<P>The regent, dreading the intire reduction of Brittany, and seeing no prospect of being able to oppose the progress of such a powerful army, as the finances of the kingdom were exhausted, and the neighbourhood of the capital insulted by the king of Navarre, who had by this time renounced his treaty: for these reasons, he resolved to conclude a peace with England, as the only means of preventing the ruin of the kingdom. With this view, he sent the bishop of Terouenne, chancellor of France, with three other commissioners, to propose a treaty; and they overtaking Edward near Gui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lardon in Beauce, he appointed plenipotentiaries to treat with them on the subject of their ambassy; though he did not interrupt his march, until he arrived at Bretigny in the Pais Chartrain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mind of Edward is said to have been dis∣posed to peace, by a dreadful storm that looked like a judgment from heav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.

The king, affrighted at this tremendous scene, threw himself from his horse upon the ground; and, stretching out his hands towards the church of Chartres, solemnly vowed to God, that he would no longer reject the off<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of peace, if it might be obtained on reasonabl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conditions.</NOTE>. Here the articles of a folid peace were settled by the dau∣phin on the part of France, and prince Edward in behalf of his father.

France or any of his ancestors; that France should restore all that he or his predecessors had possessed in the town of Montrueil; and that he should re∣main in possession of Calais and the county of Guisnes; that the king of France and the dauphin s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould renounce and give up the superiority over the coun∣tries and places thus conveyed to the king of England, who should on his part resign all pretensions to the crown of France, the dutchy of Normandy, Tou∣raine, Anjou, and Maine, the sovereignty of Flanders and Brittany, and all other claims or demands on the kings of France for any cause whatsoever, not specified in this treaty; that the king of France should be conducted to Calais, within three weeks after Midsummer, and pay three millions of gold crowns for his ransom, at different payments; and that the prisoners taken at the battle of Poitiers should remain as hostages for the payment, as well as for the de∣livery of Rochelle and some other fortresses, upon John's being set at liberty; that the dispute between Charles de Blois and John de Montfort, for the dutchy of Bretagne, should be candidly discussed, and referred to arbitration, under the sanction of both kings; but if their good offices should prove ineffectual, neither king should take any part in the quarrel; though the sovereignty of Bretagne should remain to the king of France, and John de Montfort be re∣stored to the possession of all his lands in that kingdom; that Philip of Na∣varre should retrieve all his rights and possessions; and a general amnesty be granted to his partisans, as well as to all the adherents of both parties; that the king of France should renounce his alliance with the Scots, and Edward quit all connexion with the Flemings; that all the countries, towns, and for∣tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, yielded to the king of England by this treaty, should be delivered into his hands, within a year at farthest after John's departure from Calais; and that Edward should in like manner give up the places which had been taken by his subjects, and were not comprehended in this deed of ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion; that this treaty, guarranteed by the pope, should be confirmed by the letters patent of John, in a month after his release; and both kings, with their eldest sons, the princes of the blood, and a certain number of their chief nobility, should engage upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> oath for the performance of articles.

<P>King Edward went thither in October, to receive the first payment of the ransom, amounting to six hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dred thousand crowns of gold; but the country of France had been so gri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ously exhausted, that not above two thirds of the sum could be raised; and hostages were given for the payment of the re∣mainder at Candlemas.

<P>Edward, having concluded this important negotiation, returned in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1361.</NOTE> November to England, where the peace was celebrated with all sorts of rejoicing; as the people now expected to be eased of the grievous taxes under which they had laboured so long. A parliament being convened at Westminster, on the twenty∣fourth day of January, the articles of the treaty were laid before the two houses, and unanimously approved. But the satisfaction occasioned by this event was soon damped, by the fatal consequences of a dreadful plague which broke out at this period, and swept away great numbers, among whom were the lords Mowbray, Seymour, and other persons of distinction; but none so regretted as Henry duke of Lancaster, who was universally esteemed and beloved for his great and amiable qualities. The French were likewise overjoyed at the peace, which not only saved them from immediate ruin, but restored to li∣berty their beloved sovereign, for whose ransom they taxed themselves with great chearfulness, even while their country groaned under distractions, feuds, and depredations. A great number of castles had, during the troubles, been seized by private adventurers, who formed companies of freebooters and ra∣vaged the adjacent territories; and now after the conclusion of the treaty, they refused to quit their fortresses and their rapine, alledging, they had no other means of subsistence. The counts of Foix, Armagnac, Cominges, Perigort, and other powerful barons, refused at first to transfer their homage from the crown of France to the king of England; and this aversion created such diffi∣culties and delays in delivering the countries and places according to the stipu∣lations of the treaty, that Midsummer was elapsed before the articles could be performed. At length, however, all those places were delivered up to John de Chandos, whom Edward had constituted his lieutenant in those countries, except some few fortresses possessed by those lawless banditti, who refused to comply with the orders they received. Those who did evacuate their castles, after having been used to rapine, joined a strong body of freebooters, composed of English, Gascons, French, Brabantines, Flemings, and Germans, who amounted to sixteen thousand, and ravaged all the inland provinces. The count of La Marche advancing against them, was utterly defeated in the neigh∣bourhood of Lion, and died in three days of the wounds he had received in the action. One of their leaders seized Anse on the Saone, where he fortified himself, and from thence made excursions to ravage all the neighbouring coun∣tries; the rest, to the number of thirteen thousand, marched towards Avignon, and surprised Pont St. Esprit, where they found a prodigious booty. The pope published a crusade against them, but this had no sor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of effect to their prejudice; on the contrary, they were daily joined by deserters and disbanded soldiers, allured by the hope of plunder and subsistence.

<P>The execution of the treaty of Bretigny was still retarded by those who were unwilling to evacuate the places that were ceded to the king of England; so that John's two sons the duke of Anjou and Berry, together with his brother the duke of Orleans, who were left as hostages in the power of Edward, began to be tired of their residence in England; and gave the king to understand that they might be serviceable in removing the difficulties, if they could be conveyed to Calais, where they would be nearer the scene of negotiation. They were accordingly carried thither, and allowed to ride about the country for several days together, either for business or diversion; but, their endeavours proving unsuccessful, the duke of Anjou abused his pa∣role, and made his escape into the dominions of his father, who chid him se∣verely for his dishonourable behaviour. In order to make an atonement for the fault of his son, he resolved to go to England in person, and, in a confe∣rence with Edward, endeavour to level the obstructions that prevented the execution of the treaty. When his ministers endeavoured to divert him from this resolution, he told them, that though good faith were banished out of the rest of the world, it ought to be found in the words of princes; and, that as the execution of the treaty was the condition of his ransom, he was determined to see the articles punctually performed. He accordingly arrived in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1364.</NOTE> during the Christmas holidays, when he met with a very cordial reception; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rainald. Du Tillet. Froissart.</NOTE> the kings of Cyprus and Scotland chancing to be there at the same time, the court of Edward shone with uncommon magnificence. David Bruce had found it impracticable to raise the money for his release in Scotland, and, be∣fore the treaty of Bretigny, had entered into a negotiation with the regent and council of France, who promised to advance fifty thousand marks towards the discharge of his ransom, if he would heartily engage in the interest of that kingdom, and make a powerful diversion in England. A treaty for this purpose was concluded; but such was the exhausted situation of France, that the regent could not perform his promise, and David Bruce found himself utterly unable to execute the treaty of Berwick, by virtue of which he had been set at liberty. Edward, who knew his distress, resolved to turn it to his own advantage; the queen of Scotland had died without issue, and David taking another wife, who likewi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e proved barren, the king of England of∣fered to remit the ransom, provided he would settle the crown upon the royal family of England, in case he himself should die without children. David, in order to gain time, seemed to relish the proposal, and even communicated it to the Scottish parliament, by whom it was rejected with indignation. Ed∣ward, notwithstanding this repulse, would not resign his project, especially as it seemed agreeable to David; and, in order to reconcile the Scots to his succession, proposed a federal union of the two nations, on terms so honoura∣ble and advantageous to the Scots, that nothing but the keenest resentment against Edward, who had intai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed such miseries on their country, could have prompted them to a second refusal. This negotiation miscarrying, David Bruce repaired to the court of England, in hope of prevailing upon Edward to mitigate the ransom; and though he failed in his endeavours, he and the

<P>In the course of the preceding year he had determined a dispute, about the succession of Burgundy, in favour of his own son Philip, surnamed the Hardy, who was inve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted with the dukedom, and the title of First Peer of France, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the king of Navarre, who was certainly next heir to the late duke Philip de Rouvre. As soon as Charles V. succeeded to the crown of France, he confirmed the decision of his father; and the king of Navarre, considering John's death as a favourable opportu∣nity to do himself justice, declared war against his successor. Hostilities were immediately begun on both sides; and the famous Bertrand du Guesclin, who had signalized his valour in the service of Charles de Blois, was now employed to oppose the Navarrois in Normandy. He accordingly surprised Mante and Meulant, and opened a free communication between Paris and Rouen; and the king of Navarre matched this enterprising officer with his kinsman John de Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly, Captal de Buche, who had acquired great reputation in the service of England. He was not however furnished wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a sufficient number of troops to undertake any enterprize of importance, and in the course of the campaign, had the misfortune to be routed and taken prisoner at Cocherel, after a very bloody dispute with Bertrand, who was immediately after this battle sent to the assistance of Charles de Blois in Brittany. The dispute between this no∣bleman and John de Montfort still subsisting, notwithstanding the endeavours of Edward, who proposed a partition of the dutchy: and the truce, which had been prolonged from time to time, being now expired, Montfort took the field and invested Auray; and Charles being joined by Guesclin, the counts of Auxerre and Joigny, and several other barons of France with their vassals, resolved to raise the siege, and terminate the competition by one decisive bat∣tle. John, being informed of his competitor's preparations, sollicited the assistance of John de Chandos constable of Guienne, who succoured him in person with a small body of English men at arms and archers, including a good number of brave knights, who had come from England on purpose to signalize themselves under the command of such a gallant officer. Charles, advancing to Vannes, drew up his army in order of battle, and marched to∣wards Auray against his enemy, who was posted on a plain behind the castle. Guesclin commanded the right wing; the counts of Auxerre and Joigny were stationed on the left; and the center was commanded by Charles de B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ois. The disposition of Montfort's army being left to the lord Chandos, he posted Sir Robert Knolles opposite to Guesclin; Oliver de Clisson opposed the count of Auxerre; he himself and the count de Montfort commanded the main body; and Sir Hugh de Calverly directed the corps de reserve. The whole line of each army engaged at the same instant; and Charles de Blois attacked with such impetuosity, that Montfort's standard was beaten down, and his main body obliged to give way. Calverly immediately advanced from the rear, and kept Charles in play, until the center rallied and returned to its former station; and then he retired to his post, according to the directions he had re∣ceived from Chandos. Mean while the count of Auxerre being wounded in the eye and taken prisoner, his men were discouraged and began to fall back;
<PB N="91" REF="930"/>
Oliver de Clisson, taking advantage of their disorder, charged them with re∣doubled vigour, and soon routed them with great slaughter. Calverly, observ∣ing the enemy's main body left naked by the flight of this wing, advanced through a field of broom, and attacked them in flank with such fury, that they were immediately broken and dispersed, after Charles had been run thro' the mouth, and left dead upon the spot. Guesclin still kept his ground, and fought with his usual prowess, till being grievously wounded, and environed on all hands, he was forced to yield himself prisoner to the lord Chandos, who thus obtained a complete victory, which in a manner extinguished the compe∣tition. Next day the castle of Auray surrendered, in consequence of a capitu∣lation<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1365.</NOTE> to which the garrison had agreed before the battle, which was attended with the submission of Vannes and several other important places. Great part of the noblesse of Bretagne, who had espoused the claim of Charles, looking upon the cause as desperate, came over to that of Montfort. This nobleman now advanced to the higher Brittany, and having reduced the town of Iugon, undertook the siege of Dinan, which held out during the greatest part of win∣ter, in hope of being succoured by the duke of Anjou, but was at length obliged to surrender. Then he invested Quimper Corentin, and ravaged the adjacent country. The widow of Charles, whose sons were still prisoners in England, finding herself unable to stop his progress, had recourse to the king of France for assistance. That prince being restricted by the treaty of Bretigny from interesting himself in her quarrel, and at the same time afraid of losing the sovereignty of Bretagne, should it be conquered by Montfort, proposed that he should make an honourable provision for the widow of his competitor; and in that case he might possess the dutchy in quiet, and hold it by homage of the crown of France. Montfort, with the consent of his father-in-law the king of England, closed with this proposal, and peace was established at Guerande, on condition, That in case of Montfort's dying without legiti∣ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> issue, the dutchy should descend to John eldest son of Charles de Blois:<NOTE PLACE="marg">D'Argentré's Hist. de Bre∣tagne.

In consequence of this treaty, all the places which had hitherto held out for the family of Charles, were delivered to John de Montfort, who remained in quiet possession of all Brittany. By the mediation of the Captal de Buche, while he remained a prisoner, an accommodation was effected between the kings of France and Navarre, which last received an equivalent for Mante and Meulant; and the prisoners on both sides were set at liberty.</P>

<P>France being now more than ever harrassed by the freebooting companies, who had returned from Italy, and were joined by vast numbers of licentious banditti, Charles V. desired the king of England to exert his au∣thority against them, as their leaders were chierly English and Gascons; and it h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n stipulated in the treaty of Bretigny, that in case of their proving re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory, both crowns should unite their endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to reduce them by force of arms. Edward had, by repeated proclamations, ordered all his subjects to quit that infamous society, and leave the kingdom of France; but few of the banditti obeying his order, he resolved to march against them in person. Charles, alarmed at his preparations, now intreated him to desist: and this instance of low suspicion provoked the king of England so much, that he swore he would never stir towards his assistance, even though the companies should attempt to drive him out of his kingdom. By this time they amounted to forty thousand hardy veterans, who filled all the continent with alarm and consternation.

than the freebooting companies enlisted in his service by the means of Ber∣trand du Guesclin, whom the king of France employed for that purpose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart. Hist. de Du Guesclin.</NOTE> This renowned warrior repairing to their head-quarters near Chalons sur Saone, persuaded Sir Hugh de Calverly, the same who had fought so gallantly at the battle of Auray, Sir Matthew Gournay, and the rest of the chie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tains, to engage in this enterprize, for a valuable consideration to be payed by the pope and the king of France; provided that his holiness would absolve them from the censures they had incurred; that Du Guesclin should be their commander; and that they should not be desired to serve against the prince of Wales. These articles were confirmed in a solemn treaty, by which they obliged them∣selves to surrender to the king of France all the fortresses they held in his dominions. Then they took the field; and, being joined by great numbers of the French noblesse, who were ambitious of serving under the celebrated Du Guesclin, that general soon found himself at the head of sixty thousand men. The money stipulated by France was punctually paid; but, the pope delaying the payment of what he had promised, Du Guesclin directed his march to Avignon, and demanded it in such a strain, that his holiness being seized with consternation, raised one hundred thousand livres by a capitation on the inhabitants. This sum, however, the general obliged them to restore to the people from whom it had been exacted; and then extorted two hundred thousand florins from the pockets of the pontiff and his cardinals. All the soldiers of this army wore long white crosses on their habits, as if they had engaged in a crusade; and it was given out that they were on their march against the Moors of Grenada. But the king of Castile was not deceived by that pretence. He knew their destination; recalled his troops from Arragon, and endeavoured to raise an army sufficient to cope with the invaders. But he was so hated by his subjects, that few or none appeared at the rendezvous; and the greatest part of his forces deserted in their return from Arragon. In a word, he found himself totally abandoned; and the defection was so sudden, that he scarce had time to secure himself and his family, with his treasure, at Corunna, from whence he fled with his three daughters into Gascony: while Henry assumed the title of king, and was acknowledged as such by all the cities and nobility of the kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.</NOTE></P>

<P>Had the prince of Wales granted an asylum to this tyrant in his distress, his humanity might have been excused, and perhaps commended: but surely, his engaging to restore such a monster of cruelty and injustice to the throne from which he had been so justly expelled, was an indelible stain in that character which had so long shone with unrivalled lustre. Cruelty, indeed, was a vice, of which the greatest characters of that age cannot be wholly acquitted; witness the carnage, conflagrations, famine, pestilence, and ruin, that attended both those illustrious Edwards in all their warlike ex∣peditions. Notwithstanding that blaze of glory by which their memories are surrounded, the candid and judicious observer will perceive that they were not the friends and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athers, but the destroyers, of the human race. The prince's s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heme in favour of Pedro is not even free from the suspicion of interested motives. The Castilian monarch gratified him befor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hand for his assistance, by conveying to him the dominions of Biscay, Castro de Ordoales, Bilboa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and all the intermediate countries, in a formal treaty, signed and ratified at

The king of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not only approved of this expedition, but even contributed towards the expence, by consigning to his son one hundred and twenty thousand crowns, to be payed by the king of France, as part of his father's ransom. The prince of Wales raised all the money he could borrow, and melted down his plate for the service; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Pedro satisfied the Gascon nobility with promises of large sums for the levy-money, and pay of their forces. As they could not pretend to enter Castile, while the kings of Arra∣gon and Navarre adhered to the interest of Henry de Trastamare, ambassa∣dors were sent to tamper with Charles, who consented to a conference with Don Pedro and the prince of Wales at Bayonne; where, in consideration of a large subsidy, and the cession of Guipuscoa, Vittoria, Alava, Logrogno, Guduzen, Calahorra, and Alfaro, he not only renounced his engagements with Henry, but undertook to assist Pedro with a body of forces, and grant<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> him a free passage through his dominions. While Don Pedro was employed in these measures for recovering his crown, Henry took all possible precau∣tions to maintain his acquisition. He was no sooner elevated to the throne of Castile, than he bestowed great largesses on the freebooting companies, to which he had in a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> measure owed his success; and he won the hearts of his subjects by acts of munificence, from which he acquired the epithet of Liberal. He had immediately dismissed the French forces, but retained the companies, upon whose valour he chiefly depended. He thought he had at∣tached them to his interest by his liberality; but he found himself egregiously mistaken. They were lawless ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ians whom no obligations could bind, and no principle govern. The greatest part of them had served under the prince of Wales, and were in fact the subjects of his father. They knew his tal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts, admired his courage, and dreaded the thoughts of serving against a leader of such consummate capacity; for, in so doing, they not only ran the risk of being vanquished, but also of being executed as traitors. Edward, by his emissaries, gave them to understand, that he had occasion for their service, and desired they would meet him at Guienne; and those who received the in∣timation, forthwith demanded their dismission of Henry, who had no suspicion of their design. Twelve thousand immediately began their march to the frontiers of Gascony; and the rest, who were dispersed in quarters over the country, no sooner heard of the prince's invitation, than they assembled in order to follow their companions. Gues<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lin being consulted by Henry on this emergency, advised him to sollicit the king of Arragon to block up the passes of his country, in order to prevent their return; and he himself offered to bring a body of auxiliaries from France. The companies being thus inter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epted, chose another route; and, after having endured infinite hardships, arrived on the frontiers of Foix, which the count would not allow them to pass, left they should ravage the country. But this obstruction was easily re∣moved by the assurances of John de Chandos, who went thither, and enlisted them in the prince's service. Then they were divided into several bodies, and took different routes, by which they arrived at Bourdeaux, after one of the divisions had fought and gained a battle against a body of French forces, who attacked them at Montauban in Quercy.</P>

which, when added to his other English and Gascon forces, composed a for∣midable army, he began his march about the latter end of February; and, passing the Pyrenees in three divisions, consisting each of ten thousand horse, that marched within a day's distance of one another, arrived in safety at Pampeluna, where he was abundantly supplied with provisions and necessaries by the king of Navarre. From thence he advanced to Salvaterra, a town on the frontiers of Castile, the inhabitants of which submitted without resistance. Nevertheless, Pedro desired they might be all put to the sword, as a terror to other rebels who adhered to the usurper: but Edward disappointed his brutal revenge, by representing that the massacre of those who submitted, would drive the rest of his subjects to despair. From this place they proceeded to Vittoria, resolving to pass the Ebro at the bridge of Logrogno, and take post at Navarel. Mean while Don Henry had assembled ten thousand Castilian men at arms, well mounted on barbed horses; besides twenty thousand com∣mon horsemen on genets, armed cap-a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pee; ten thousand cross-bows, and six times that number of infantry. With these he advanced to San Miguel, where he was joined by Bertrand du Guesclin, with four thousand men at arms, which he had raised in Brittany, France, and Arragon. Confiding in such a numerous army of well-appointed soldiers, Henry neglected the advice of the marechal de Andrehan, who proposed he should guard the passage of the Ebro, and ruin the English by cutting off their convoys of provision. He had already sent an herald to Pampeluna, to assure the prince of Wales, that he would fight him as soon as he entered Castile: and Edward, having detained the messenger until he had crossed the Ebro, retorted his defiance; though, at the same time, he proposed terms of accommodation, which Henry rejected with disdain, advancing towards Najara, in order to give him battle. Edward, on the third day of April, marched towards the enemy, in the following order: The van was conducted by the duke of Lancaster and John de Chandos; the prince himself commanded in the centre; and the rear was brought up by James king of Majorca, attended by Oliver de Clisson, the Captal de Buche, the lords of Armagnac and Albret, with other noble∣men of Gascony. The right wing of the Spaniards was commanded by Ber∣trand du Guesclin, and the marechal de Andrehan at the head of the foreign men at arms; the count of Sancelloni was posted on the left, with his brother Sancho; and the main body was directed by Don Henry in person. Edward having observed their order from a hill which lay between him and the enemy, commanded the duke of Lancaster and John de Chandos to dismount their horsemen, and attack the right of the Spaniards under Guesclin, whom they accordingly charged with great impetuosity, at the head of the freebooting companies: but they met with such a warm reception, that the dispute con∣tinued a long time with dubious success. Mean while the prince attacked on the right; and, at the first onset, broke the wing commanded by the count of Sancelloni, who instantly fled with two thousand lances. The prince, leaving the king of Majorca to finish the route, wheeled about, and fell upon the main body of the enemy, commanded by Henry, who distinguished him∣self by very extraordinary acts of valour: though the prince of Wales pene∣trated through his battalia three times, he as often rallied it by the help of a body of reserve mounted on genets; nor did he give ground, until the duke

There they kept Easter with great solemnity; and Pedro received deputies from all the considerable cities of Castile, with tenders of service, and assurances of loyalty.

The Castilian pleaded inability; but proposed that Edward should stay with his forces in the neighbourhood of Valladolid, until he could raise the money at Seville, to which city he repaired, solemnly protesting that the troops should be satisfied before Whitsuntide. Edward having resided in that city till Mid∣summer, received nothing but trifling excuses, which plainly shewed that Pedro had no intention to fulfil his engagements; and indeed his ingratitude was a just judgment upon the prince of Wales for having undertaken the cause of such a ruffian. The heats of Spain becoming excessive, and the troops be∣ginning to sicken, Edward marched to Agreda, on the borders of Arragon, and made an agreement with the king of that country for the passage of the freebooting companies; while he himself, with the rest of his forces, took the route of Navarre, through which he returned to Bourdeaux, where he was re∣ceived in triumph amidst the acclamations of the people.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1368.</NOTE> This season of rejoicing was not of long duration in Guienne. The prince's glory was so acceptable to the English nation, that the parlia∣ment which met in May granted a large subsidy to the king, who explained to both houses the nature of a treaty, which had been long in negotiation with the king of Scotland. That prince offered to maintain a perpetual peace with England, provided Edward would renounce, for himself and his heirs, all title to the superiority of his kingdom: but the lords and commons de∣clared, that they could not consent to such a peace without disherison of the king, and his rights, which they were bound by solemn oath to maintain to the utmost of their power. The king had sent for the prince of Wales from Guienne; but by this time the discontents which began to appear in that country, prevented his departure. His finances were exhausted by the late expedition; and Pedro's breach of faith reduced him to great difficulties.

Six thousand of the freebooters, who returned to Guienne, lived at free quarter, because Edward could not pay their arrears; and the inhabitants complaining of the injuries they daily sustained from those licensed robbers, the prince ordered them to quit the country. They had such personal regard for Edward, that they obeyed his command; and, passing the Loire, esta∣blished their head-quarters in Champagne: but, even after their departure, there was so much pay due to the rest of the troops, that he could find no other method of discharging the debt, but that of raising a tax upon chim∣neys; which was extremely disagreeable to the inhabitants, and violently opposed by the count of Armagnac, the lord of Albret, who had lately mar∣ried Margaret sister to the queen of France, and other great barons of Gas∣cony, who loudly declared it an innovation to which they would not submit. They even retired to their castles, and threatened to rebel rather than subject themselves to an imposition so contrary to their privileges, which the prince of Wales had bound himself by oath to maintain.</P>

<P>Henry count of Trastamare, taking this opportunity to retrieve the crown of Castile, assembled a small army, by the assistance of the duke of Anjou and the king of Arragon; and, entering Old Castile, was every where received with open arms. Burgos, Valladolid, Leon, and Astorga, admitted him without hesitation. He was joined by a great number of the nobility, with their vassals and adherents; and met with no opposition, until he arrived in the neighbourhood of Toledo, which, refusing him admittance, he re∣solved to besiege it in form. Pedro, who resided in Seville, began to assemble an army to oppose his competitor; but very few of his own subjects repaired to his standard. Nevertheless, the kings of Grenada and Tremesin furnished him with twenty thousand Moors; and his kinsman Ferdinand king of Por∣tugal sent a body of forces to his assistance. He expected a rein<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orcement of six thousand freebooters, under Sir Hugh Calverly; but, without waiting for their arrival, he began his march from Seville, at the head of forty thousand men, to raise the siege of Toledo. Bertrand du Guesclin, who had by this time joined Henry with two thousand men at arms, advised that prince to abandon the siege, and surprize Pedro on his march. His advice was fol∣lowed, and the scheme executed with such success, that Pedro was routed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Thus fell, by the hands of an assassin, one of the most savage tyrants who had ever sat upon any throne; and his crown was usurped by his murderer, whose son Henry afterwards se∣cured himself in possession of Castile, by marrying Catharine, daughter of John of Ghent, by his second wife Constance, the eldest daughter and heiress<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.

<P>During this revolution in Castile, the discontented lords of Gas∣cony, finding the prince of Wales inflexible in the article of the Fouage, which was severely exacted, had recourse to the king of France; and, repairing to the court of Charles, presented appeals to the court of peers for redress. They assured him, the prince of Wales had lost the hearts of his subjects in Guienne, not only by this exorbitant tax, which was rigorously collected, but also by conferring all posts of dignity and profit upon Englishmen, to the
<PB N="98" REF="1000"/>
prejudice of the natives. They affirmed, that should war be once actually dec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the whole dutchy would rise in favour of Charles. They undertook to main<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain the war at their own expence; and promised to the king of France, that they wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld live and die in his quarrel. Though Charles was not a prince of a very mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial disposition, he longed for an opportunity to recover the terri∣tories in Guienne, which had been alienated from his crown in the late peace, as well as to as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert his sovereignty over the whole dutchy; yet he was averse to engage in a wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h he foresaw must be attended with great dan∣ger and exp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce. While he thus fluctuated between fear and ambition, the Gascon noblemen were amused with undetermined promises and rich presents, and allowed to summon the prince of Wales, in his name, before the court of peers, to answer their complaints. Edward, provoked at this citation, sent a message to Charles, importing that he was ready to set out for Paris, at his in∣vitation, with sixty thousand men in his retinue. The French king at last re∣solved to break with England, encouraged by the declining age of old Ed∣ward, and the lingering distemper which attacked the prince of Wales in his last expedition, and was generally deemed incurable. Charles began to make preparations in private, and resolving to possess himself of Ponthieu before he should declare war against England, tampered with the citizens of Abbe∣ville and the noblesse of that country, whom he gained over to his interest. At the same time he sent ambassadors into England, with assurances of his pa∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fic disposition, and certain overtures for an improvement and fresh confirma∣tion of the last treaty. These deputies found no difficulty in persuading Ed∣ward of their master's sincerity; and, in their return to France, met a messenger at Dover, dispatched by Charles with an insulting defiance to the king of Eng∣land. Not a little surprised at this message, he ordered the lords Percy, Ne∣vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and Windsor, to set out immediately for Ponthieu, with a reinforcement for the defence of that pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince; but they had scarce reached Dover when advice came that Abbeville, St. Valery, Crotoy, Rue, and Noyelles were sur∣rendered by the inhabitants to the count of St. Pol and Hugh de Chatillon,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> officers of the French king.

so unjustly kindled. The dukes of Anjou and Berry, reinforced by the free∣booters on the Loire, whom Charles had engaged in his interest, fell into Guienne on different quarters, and were joined by all the nobility of the province; while Sir Hugh Calverly returning from Spain, with six thousand of the same companies, enlisted in the service of the prince of Wales. The earls of Cambridge and Pembroke, arriving about the same time from England, with a reinforcement, were detached into Perigort, where they took Bourdailles by stratagem; and John de Chandos and Guichard d' Angle were sent to Montauban to oppose the progress of the duke of Anjou. The war was carried on in slight skirmishes with various success, and several places surprised on both sides. Among these, the castle of Belle-Perche in the Bourbonnois was taken by the freebooters in the English service, who found in the place the lady Isabella, mother to the queen of France, and to the duke of Bourbon. She was honourably entertained in her own castle till next year, when her son at the head of a numerous army invested the place, and must have reduced it accordingly, had not the earls of Cambridge and Pembroke marched to its relief. These noblemen challenged the duke of Bour∣bon to battle; and, he declining the invitation, they carried off his mother and the garrison at noon-day, without his attempting to rescue her from the hands of her enemies. She was afterwards exchanged for Simon de Burley, one of the chief commanders of the freebooters, who had been surprised and taken in an engagement between Mirebeau and Lusignan. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.</NOTE></P>

<P>On the side of Poitou, the French surprised Chatelleraut, and reduced several places; while John de Chandos took the duke of Anjou's strong castle of Roche-sur-yon; but this gallant commander was afterwards mortally wounded in a casual rencounter, at the bridge of Lussac, to the infi∣nite regret of the English, whose interest in those parts suffered severely by his death; but the greatest prejudice they sustained was by the intrigues of John de Cardeillec, archbishop of Tholouse, who persuaded the city of Cahors and se∣veral other places to revolt from the prince of Wales, and put themselves under the French king's protection. Mean while John of Ghent duke of Lancaster, landing at Calais with a body of forces, marched directly to Harfleur in Nor∣mandy, with a view to burn the ships assembled in that harbour to transport an army of French into England; but the duke's design was defeated by the count of St. Pol, who threw himself into the place with a strong reinforce∣ment: so that John desisted from the enterprize; and having ravaged great part of Picardy, returned to Calais. The king of England, thinking it high time to strengthen his interest with foreign alliances, concluded a league with the dukes of Juliers and Gueldres, and Charles king of Navarre, which last however was in the sequel debauched by the offers of Charles. Edward like∣wise treated with the towns of Flanders, and Albert of Bavaria, administrator of Hainault, Holland, Zealand, and Friesland; but all he could obtain from these powers was a promise of adhering to a strict neutrality. He was how∣ever secure on the side of Scotland, where, upon the death of David Bruce, his nephew Robert Steward had succeeded to the throne, and a truce for fourteen years had been concluded between the two nations.</P>

<P>About Midsummer Sir Robert Knolles marched from Calais, at the head of a considerable army, and passing by Arras, ravaged Picardy without opposition: though he was attended by a flying army of French, who had orders to watch his motions, and harrass him in his march without hazarding an engagement. For this reason, Knolles was obliged to proceed with great circumspection; so that the country did not suffer much from his straggling parties. He did not attempt any town of consequence; but, after having tra∣versed
<PB N="101" REF="1030"/>
the Vermandois, Champagne, and Brie, where he raised some contribu∣tions, he arrived in the neighbourhood of Paris, and burned the adjacent vil∣lages, in hope of provoking the French to a battle. Charles had a strong body of forces within the city, and his nobility were eager to engage the English; but the king repressed their vivacity, and absolutely refused to hazard a battle, because he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oresaw that the English would not undertake the siege, and could not remain much longer in their present situation, without being distressed by want of provision. Knolles accordingly retired by the way of Montlehery, and having ravaged Beauce and the Gatinois, marched into Le Maine, with design to take up his winter-quarters on the frontiers of Brittany. This scheme was opposed by Thomas lord Grandison, Walter Fitzwalter, and other young no∣blemen, who payed very little regard to the command or directions of Knolles, because he had been a chieftain among the freebootets. Their contempt of this leader was encouraged and augmented by the insinuations of Sir John Min∣streworth, whom Knolles had promoted to a considerable command in the army: but having embezzled large sums designed for the pay of the soldiers, he endeavoured to ruin his benefactor, that he might have a chance of escaping without being called to account for his fraudulent practices. By the instiga∣tions of this incendiary, those young adventurers refused to accompany Knolles into Brittany, but separating from him with their forces, established their quarters in Anjou and Touraine. Bertrand du Guesclin being about this time creat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d constable of France, and resolving to begin his office with some signal exploit, assembled a body of troops, and advanced to Caen in Normandy, where being joined by the troops of that province, commanded by the marechal de Blain∣ville, he directed his march towards Le Maine, where a considerable body of the English was quartered. Knolles hearing of his intention, sent orders to all his troops to re-unite, in order to give the enemy battle; and among the rest, the lords Grandison, Fitzwalter, and Minstreworth, hastened towards him, that they might have a share of the engagement. Guesclin having received in∣telligence of their march, surprized them, about the latter end of November, near Pont de Valaines, on the borders of Le Maine; and though they made a gallant resistance, they were overpowered by numbers, and routed, four thousand of their men being either killed or taken, and Grandison himself fall∣ing into the hands of the enemy. Minstreworth, who was suspected of having given intelligence to the constable, made his escape, and returning to England blamed Knolles for the disaster: but that officer's character was afterwards vin∣dicated by Sir Allan Boxhull, who had served in this expedition, so much to the satisfaction of his majesty, that Minstreworth was summoned before the king and council, to vindicate his own behaviour. Rather than stand trial, he fled the kingdom and revolted to the enemy: then he was outlawed, and being taken in the sequel, suffered death as a traytor. After the action at Pont de Valaines, Knolles provided for the defence of S.

He had meditated a descent upon England, and made great preparations for that expedition; and Edward notifying this design to his parliament, which met in February at Westminster, the lords and commons granted an aid of fifty thousand pounds, to provide for the security of the kingdom.

<P>Edward sent part of the fleet prepared to oppose the French inva∣sion, as a convoy to Humphrey de Bohun earl of Hereford and Southampton, who went as ambassador with the king's youngest son Thomas of Wodestoke, to conclude an alliance against France, with the duke of Brittany. That prince, upon receiving a grant of Chisac, Melle, and Civray in Poitou, agreed to do homage to Edward, and put twelve of his seaports into the hands of the Eng∣lish who should come to his assistance. This alliance was afterwards improved into a league offensive and defensive, cemented by another grant of the honour of Richmond in England, which the duke of Lancaster resigned in his favour. The king of England had made overtures of such another league with the towns of Flanders; but his negotiations were defeated by the influence of their count Lewis, a staunch adherent of Charles, who, though he could not prevail upon the estates of his country to declare for France, found means to engage a great number of individuals in his interest. Among these was John Peterson, com∣mander of a Flemish fleet, which, having taking in a loading of wine and salt at Bayonne and La Baye, chanced to fall in with the squadron under the lord Guy de Brian, the English admiral, who cond<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted the earl of Hereford to Brit∣tany. Peterson bearing down upon him, in an hostile manner, a sharp action <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsued, in which the Flemish commander was defeated, with the slaughter of four thousand men, and he and his whole fleet were taken and conveyed to Eng∣land.

This advantage was counterballanced by another event in Guienne, which was attended with the loss of great part of that province. Pedro, late king of Castile, had left

When the fleet that conveyed him<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Though the Spanish ships were much larger than the English vessels, and supplied with cannon, which the others wanted, the battle was maintained all day with dubious success, the English being joined by John de Harpeden senes∣chal of Rochelle, who embarked with the lords of Tonnay-Boulonne, Sur∣geres, and Limers, and a small party, on board of four inconsiderable vessels. Next day the engagement was renewed at high-water, and continued till three in the afternoon, when victory declared for the Spaniards. The cannon made terrible havock among the English; the earl of Pembroke was boarded by the enemy and taken alive, with Sir Guichard d'Angle, Sir John Curson, and se∣veral other persons of distinction. The vessel in which the military chest was de∣pos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted, perished with twenty thousand pounds in ready money; and all the rest of the ships, with the knights, soldiers, and mariners, fell a prey to the vic∣tors, who sailed home with their booty.

Nevertheless the disaster diffused a general consternation through the whole country of Guienne; and the French did not fail to make advantage of their apprehension.

Jean d'Angeley, Engoulesme, and Taillebourg, surren∣dered without resistance; the bishop and people of Saintes compelled Sir William Farringdon to give up the place; the castle of Rochelle was surprized by the citizens, but did not submit to France until they had obtained a grant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l extraordinary privileges, and demolished the citadel; St. Benoit in t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e neighbourhood was taken by storm, and the garrison put to the sword; Marans and Surgeres made very little resistance; Fontenay surrendered, after having stood several assaults; and Thouars capitulated for a truce till Michael∣mas, when the garrison obliged themselves to yield up the place, if not re∣lieved before that time by the king of England, or one of his sons in person.

He ordered four hundred large ships to be provided for the transportation of his army; and as he proposed that the prince of Wales, who was now thought to be in a way of recovery, should accom∣pany him to that country, he assembled the prelates, lords, knights, and com∣mons of the realm, that they might swear to maintain the succession of Richard, son to prince Edward, in case his father and grandfather should die in the ex∣pedition. The ceremony being performed, he appointed him guardian of the kingdom, and embarked with his army at Sandwich on the thirtieth day of August, attended by his three sons, and a great number of English nobility: but being detained above a month by contrary winds, so that he could not possibly reach the coast of Poitou by Michaelmas, he returned on the sixth day o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> October to Winchelsey, and laid aside the enterprize for that season. His f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ends in G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ienne had assembled a body of forces to join him at his landing, and though disappointed in that hope, would have attempted the relief of Thouars; but the officers of the garrison declined their assistance, justly ob∣serving, that they were excluded, by the articles of their capitulation, from the benefit of being relieved by any person but the king of England or one of his sons; and therefore they surrendered the place according to the convention. While the king continued on board, prince Richard had summoned a parlia∣ment to meet for the redress of grievances; but in consequence of Edward's unexpected return, the meeting of it was postponed till the third day of No∣vember, where the lord Guy Brian gave them to understand, that the prince of Wales had resigned the principality of Guienne into the hands of his father, because the revenue was insufficient, not only to maintain the wars of that country, but even to support the ordinary expence of the government. The lords and commons were so zealous for their monarch's glory, that, notwith∣standing the vast expence of the late fruitless armament, they continued the subsidy on wool and skins for two years longer, and granted besides a fifteenth of their revenues and moveables, a tenth being payed by the boroughs: but these supplies came too late to prevent the loss of Poitou and Saintonge, which were very unprofitable acquisitions to England, because they drained it of men<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> and money; and the defence of them depended in a great measure upon the weather, which could not be favourable in every emergency.</P>

<P>The constable Du Guesclin taking the field early in the spring,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1374.</NOTE> invested Sivray, routed a body of English and Gascons, who attempted to beat up his quarters, and by the middle of April entirely reduced the provin∣ces of Poitou and Saintonge. St. Sauveur in Normandy was besieged by the French, and Becherel in Brittany invested by Oliver de Clisson, and other no∣blemen of that country, who, being in the French interest, hated John de Montfort for his attachment to Edward. Owen of Wales was said to be at sea with six thousand men at arms, in order to make a descent upon England; and Edward, by this report, was induced to equip a large fleet for the defence of the kingdom. William Montacute, earl of Salisbury, being appointed admi∣ral, set fail for St. Malo in Brittany, where finding seven large Spanish car∣racks, he burned them, to the great dissatisfaction of the Bretons, who suspect∣ing their duke of having given intelligence of these vessels to his father-in-law the king of England, began to look upon him as an enemy to his country. The king of France made use of this pretence for confiscating that province; and the constable Du Guesclin, being charged with the execution of this sen∣tence, entered Bretagne at the head of an army. Rennes, Dinan, Guingamp, Quimper-Corentin, Vannes, and several other places, submitted without re∣sistance; Nantes obtained an honourable capitulation; Hennebond and Le Conquet were taken by storm; and all Brittany, except Brest and two other places, was subdued before Midsummer. John de Montfort, finding himself abandoned by his subjects, took refuge in England, leaving the management of his affairs in Brittany to Sir Robert Knolles, whom he appointed his lieute∣nant. That officer having put his own castle of Derval in a posture of defence, retired with Sir William Neville to Brest, which was well provided with all necessaries for sustaining a siege, and inhabited by people who were staunch to the interest of their sovereign. This place the constable invested with six thou∣sand men, sending Oliver de Clisson with the rest of his army to besiege Roche-sur-yon, on the borders of Poitou. The garrison, after having stood some assaults, agreed to surrender, if not relieved in thirty days. Then Clisson undertook the siege of Derval, and was joined by the constable himself, who had converted the siege of Brest into a blockade: Derval being hard pressed, the garrison demanded a capitulation, by which they obliged themselves to surrender, if not relieved in two months by the duke of Brittany, or some other general able to keep the field against the French forces; and two knights and an esquire were delivered as hostages for the performance of these articles. Knolles seeing no prospect of relieving his castle, but by making the same ca∣pitulation for Brest, submitted to that expedient, and gave hostages for sur∣rendering the place within forty days, in full confidence of being relieved by the earl of Salisbury, who hovered on the coast, and had lately received a con∣siderable reinforcement from England. He accordingly landed his soldiers in the neighbourhood, and sent an herald to the constable at Nantes, with a mes∣sage, importing that he was come to relieve Brest, and demanding that he would either release the hostages, or come and give him battle. Du Guesclin told him, he was ready to fight if he would advance to Nantes, where the treaty was concluded; and the earl signified that he would meet him at Nantes, provided he would furnish his troops with horses for the march. This propo∣sal being rejected, the earl continued in his camp until the term of the capitu∣lation
<PB N="106" REF="1080"/>
was expired, and then entered Brest, which he supplied with a reinforce∣ment, provisions, and necessaries; in consequence of which Du Guesclin sent the hostages to prison. Sir Robert Knolles, repairing to his castle of Derval, gave the French to understand, that the place being his own inheri∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, could not be given up without his leave; and therefore he rejected the capitulation, which had been made without his authority. At the expiration of the two months the duke of Anjou demanded the place, threatening to behead the hostages in case of refusal. Knolles vowed retaliation upon the French prisoners that were in his hands; and the duke putting his threats in execu∣tion, the other caused three French knights and an esquire to be beheaded in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of the besiegers, who forthwith abandoned the enterprize. By this time the duke of Anjou and the constable were summoned to Paris, in order to op∣pose the progress of the duke of Lancaster, who began his march from Cala<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the month of July, with an army of thirty thousand men; and having ra∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged the open country of Artois and Picardy, without making any attempt upon the fortified places, which were well provided with garrisons and provi∣sions, passed through Champagne, Burgundy, Beaujolois, Forez, and Auvergne, into the province of Guienne, having been all the way attended by a body of French troops, which had orders to avoid an engagement. In order to defray the expence of this expedition and the ensuing campaign, a parliament was con∣voked at Westminster in the month of November, when the lords and com∣mons, after having conferred together, granted two fifteenths for counties, and as many tenths for boroughs, to be levied in two years, with an additional<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> duty on merchandize; though these aids were conditional, because by this time a treaty was set on foot at Bruges, under the pope's mediation.</P>

There he continued till the end of August, when alledging the truce was ex∣pired, he made himself master of La Reole, and forty towns and castles sub∣mitted to him without opposition; in a word, he, without striking one blow, reduced the whole province of Gascony, except Bayonne, Bourdeaux, Mor∣tagne,

<P>The conferences for peace at Bruges were still maintained in presence of the pope's legates, though hitherto they had little reason to believe they should be able to effect an accommodation; and, in the mean time, the castle of Becherel in Brittany, which had been gallantly defended by Sir John Cornwal, was surrendered to the French by capitulation. John de Montfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1375.</NOTE> sovereign of that country, accompanied by the earls of Cambridge, Marche, Warwick, Stafford, and Kent, set sail from England in the beginning of May, with a considerable body of forces, and landed at St. Mahé in Bretagne, which they took by assault: the same fate attended St. Pol de Lion; but Morlaix, Lannion, Lantreguier, Roche-de-rien, Guingamp, and Roche-Bernard, sub∣mitted without resi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance. Then he invested St. Brien; and Oliver de Clis∣son tried to make a diversion, by undertaking the siege of a fort lately erected by Sir John Devreux, in the neighbourhood of Quimperly. Montfort im∣mediately quitted S. Brien, and advanced against Clisson with such secrecy and expedition, that he had no intimation of his march, until he was within two leagues of his quarters, so that he scarce had time to throw himself into Quim∣perly. The duke of Bretagne was extremely incensed against this officer, not only as his implacable and indefatigable enemy, but also as author of all those barbarous counsels, which had produced so much bloodshed and desolation. It was by his advice that the hostages of Derval were put to death. He had with his own hands assassinated fifteen Englishmen, who, at the reduction of Benon, had retired to a tower, and surrendered upon capitulation: he had sworn that he would never give quarter to any native of that kingdom; and such was the san∣guinary disposition of the man, that he was generally stiled the Butcher of Brit∣tany. Montfort approaching Quimperly, ordered an immediate assault to be giv∣en; but his soldiers were repulsed, by the valour or despair of the defendants. The viscomte de Rohan and the lord of Beaumanoir commanded the garrison, and had given the duke so many causes of offence, that they had very little hope of mercy. Finding it impracticable to maintain the place against the vigour of his assaults, they and Clisson offered to surrender, on condition of being ad∣mitted to ransom without loss of life or limb: but he insisted on their surren∣dering at discretion. Then they fued for a truce of e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght days, at the expira∣tion of which they would yield themselves up, if not relieved in the interim. This request was granted, because there was no prospect of their being suc∣coured: yet in that interval, the besiegers received advice of the truce con∣cluded at Bruges, together with the duke of Lancaster's orders to desist from all hostilities. Montfort, sacrificing his revenge to his honour, raised the siege immediately, and dismissing the English troops, retired to Auray. The French were not so punctilious with respect to the garrison of St. Sauveur, which, notwithstanding the same kind of capitulation, were obliged to sur∣render,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D'Argentré<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Daniel.

<P>This convention was deemed dishonourable in England, where the people began to be very much out of humour with the administration. They saw the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruits of the money they had wasted, and the blood they had shed, almost blasted; they saw the Black Prince hastening to his grave, the nation governed by a knavish ministry, and the great Edward sunk into dotage. He had outlived all his spirit and magnanimity, and become the contemptible slave of an infamous woman called Alice Perrers, who had been a domestic of his late virtuous queen Philippa, and married to William de Windsor, at one time lieutenant of Ireland. Edward was so infatuated by the personal charms of this new idol, that he resigned himself w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olly to her direction; and, in order to gratify her avarice, encouraged certain corrupt practices, which, in the vi∣gour of his intellects, he would have disdained to countenance. He was even so weak as to convey to this abandoned favourite, the jewels and moveables of the queen Philippa: she had the presumption to preside in the public courts of j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stice; she created and displaced ministers at her pleasure; so that no per∣son of ability or virtue would be concerned in the administration. The royal authority grew into contempt; the reins of government were shamefully slackened; and the whole kingdom complained of mismanagement and op∣pression.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch.

Tyrrel.</NOTE> Robert king of Scotland had concluded a treaty with France, in which, among other articles, it was stipulated, that no Frenchman should serve against Scotland; nor any Scot enlist with the enemies of France. The Scottish king accordingly recalled his subjects from the army of England; and in so doing gave such umbrage to Edward, that he issued orders for arraying the northern militia to repel the invasion which he seemed to think was meditated by the king of Scotland. Robert looked upon this preparation as a design to invade his dominions, and arming in his own defence, a petty war ensued between the wardens of the Scottish and English Marches. The earls of Marche and Murray massacred the English at a fair in Roxburgh, in revenge for the death of a Scot who had been murdered in the same place. The English fell into Scotland and plundered the estate of Sir John Gordon, who indemnified him∣self by entering England, from whence he returned with a large booty, and Sir John Lilburn, whom he had defeated and taken. Then the lord Percy crossed the border with seven thousand men, who were routed by a stratagem; and Sir Thomas Musgrave governor of Berwick, was intercepted and made pri∣soner

<P>The people of England respected their monarch even in his failings. They remembered the lustre of his former conduct: they reviewed the glories of his reign, and the vigour of his government; and bore with his infirmities, until the effects of them became pernicious to the commonwealth. The public treasure was lavished without any advantage to the kingdom; the revenues were embezzled; the government had borrowed money at exorbitant interest, and forced the king's creditors to take the tenth, twentieth, and even the hundredth penny, by way of composition: the subjects laboured under many other grievances, which the parliament now resolved to redress. It had been summoned to meet on the twelfth day of February, but did not sit for the dispatch of business till the twenty-fourth day of April. Sir John Knivet the lord chancellor having opened the assembly with a speech, in which he explained the preparations of France, and represented the necessity of granting an aid to defeat the purposes of that indefatigable enemy, the lords and commons having conferred together, continued the subsidy on wool and skins for three years longer than the term for which it had been granted: and though they excused themselves from raising a larger supply for the pre∣sent, on account of the pestilence, murrain, and destruction of grain, under which the kingdom had for some time laboured, they declared they would grant another aid, in case any new cause of expence should intervene. But before they provided for the necessities of the government, they made a warm remonstrance upon the grievances of the nation. They complained of the embezzlement of the public treasure, and usurious contracts, which had been made by some of the king's officers, to the unspeakable prejudice of the re∣venue. They desired the king would augment his council to ten or twelve of the chief prelates and nobility; and that nothing of moment should be trans∣acted without the advice and concurrence of four at least of that number: provided, nevertheless, that the chancellor, treasurer, privy-seal, and the king's other officers, might perform their functions, independent of those counsellors. They likewise insisted upon the king's restraining his ministers and officers from receiving gifts and presents, except their own pensions and perquisites: and they impeached several individuals for having raised money illegally, and committed extortion in the exercise of their offices. Among these was Richard Lyon, a merchant of London, who farmed the king's cus∣toms: he was accused of usury, as well as of having smuggled wool and dif∣ferent sorts of merchandize, to other ports than Calais, where the staple was established. Perhaps they would not have deemed him an object worthy of their regard, had not they expected he would have discovered his abettors and connexion with some of the greatest noblemen of the kingdom. John of Ghent himself was suspected of being concerned in these fraudulent and op∣pressive practices; and though he escaped on this occasion undiscovered, the lord Latimer, who was chamberlain and privy-counsellor to the king, was convicted of such clandestine traffic, and other instances of oppression and corruption. That nobleman made a very strong and distinct defence; but such was the antiministerial spirit of the parliament, that he was deprived of his employments, and confined in the Marshalsea until he should pay a fine of twenty thousand marks. Other offenders, of different degrees, were pro∣secuted <NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1376.</NOTE>

<P>At this period the English lost their darling prince of Wales, who, after having been emaciated by a lingering distemper, died at the palace of Westminster, in the forty-sixth year of his age, to the unutterable sorrow of his father, and the deep-felt regret of the whole nation, which had flat∣tered itself with the prospect of uninterrupted happiness under the reign of such an accomplished sovereign. Instances of his generosity and moderation we have already recorded; and such was his military prowess, that all Europe considered him as the most invincible hero of the age in which he lived. He never fought a battle which he did not gain; nor undertook an enterprize in which he did not succeed. The soldiers loved him to a degree of enthusiasm; and always fought under his banner with an assurance of victory, which no odds could lessen, and no accidents disappoint.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John de Greilly, Captal de B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>che, was so affected with the tidings of his death, that he is said to have refused his food, and pined away in his confinement at Paris, unable or unwilling to survive his beloved master, from whose interest and service the court of France had tried in vain to seduce him, by offers of extraordinary prefer∣ment.</NOTE> His affability, politeness, piety, clemency, and liberal disposition, have been celebrated by different<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>storians. But, after all these encomiums, if we may be allowed to judge from the transactions of his life, we shall pronounce his character rather striking than amiable, and not so much the object of love as the theme of ad∣miration. The particular instances of his clemency have not been handed down; unless we bestow that title on his behaviour at Najara, where he pre∣vented Pedro from massacring his subjects in cold blood. But we find him committing horrible devastations, in his march from Bourdeaux to the Loire, through a defenceless country. We see him espousing the cause of a brutal monster, who ought to have been hunted down as the foe of the human kind: oppressing the subjects of Guienne into revolt and rebellion; and afterwards putting the inhabitants of Limoges to the sword, without distinction of age, sex, or condition. Even his military talents seem to have been confined to an impetuosity of personal valour; for he planned no scheme that denoted a great extent of capacity or invention, but, on the contrary, entangled himself, even in that expedition which produced his greatest glory, with such temerity of indis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retion, that nothing but the enemy's folly and precipitation could have prevented his ruin or captivity: in that case, he would have been justly blamed for his misconduct; and Poitiers, which proved the consummation of his renown, would have turned out the scene of his disgrace. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Edward acquired the surname of the Black Prince from the misery he intailed upon the French nation.

prince to Canterbury, where his obsequies were solemnized with great magnificence: and, after the funeral, Richard was by patent created prince of Wales, duke of Cornwall, and earl of Chester. He was invested with all his father's honours and lands, except those that were assigned to his mother as her dower; and, in the beginning of the next year, he received the order of the garter. This active parliament petitioned that justices of the peace might be named by the lords and knights who represented the counties in parliament; that they might be sworn before the king's council; that they should not be removed without consent of parliament; and that they might be allowed appointments for subsistence. The king, thinking this demand encroached upon his prerogative, replied, that he and his council would ap∣point justices of the peace, and take into consideration the other part of their proposal. The demands of the parliament seemed to increase in proportion to the condescension of the ministry; and the opposition became so troublesome, that the duke of Lancaster, who now governed the kingdom, was glad of an opportunity to put an end to the session. Edward had by this time retired to Eltham in Kent, where he intirely divested himself of the cares of govern∣ment, and seemed to indulge his sorrow for the death of his eldest son. John<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1377.</NOTE> of Ghent being declared regent of the kingdom, insinuated himself into the favour of the princess of Wales, who resided with her son Richard at Ken∣nington in Surry; and he acted in concert with Alice Perrers, who now re∣gained all her former influence. At her instigation, the regent imprisoned Sir Peter de la Mere, who had spoke with great freedom against her in the late parliament: for the same reason, the earl of Marche was deprived of his marechal's staff, which was given to the lord Percy; and all the temporalities of William of Wickham, bishop of Winchester, seized upon frivolous pre∣tences. Then they began to take measures for chusing another parliament, of a complexion different from that of the last; and they succeeded in their endeavours. It was summoned to meet on the twenty-seventh day of Janu∣ary; and, in the interim, conferences for a peace were carried on at Bruges, though with very little prospect of success: for the French king demanded the restitution of Calais, and the repayment of great part of his father's ran∣som. Edward not only refused these demands, but even insisted upon France's renouncing all claim to the sovereignty of Guienne. The truce, however, was prolonged to the first day of April; and the court of England filled the nation with alarms of invasion from France, Spain, and Scotland. The ministry likewise fomented the discontents of the people with respect to papal usurpations; and cherished a spirit of resentment against all foreigners without distinction.</P>

<P>The new parliament granted a considerable subsidy, by way of poll-tax, which was even extended to all the clergy, except the Mendicant Friars: but, as the necessities of the court would not admit of a delay, until this aid could be collected, the ministers demanded a loan of four thousand pounds from the city of London, which refused to advance the money. This refusal was resented in such a manner by the court, that Adam Staple was removed from the mayoralty by a special mandamus, and Sir Richard Whittington appointed as his successor in that office. The commons ma∣nifested their complaisance to the ministry, not only in the supplies which
<PB N="112" REF="1140"/>
they readily granted, but also in reversing a great many uncourtly resolutions which had been taken in the preceding parliament. The sentence pronounced against lord Latimer was revoked; Lyon was pardoned; and Alice Perrers restored to all h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r former rights, privileges, and estate, on pretence that she had never been tried before the parliament for the misdemeanours laid to her charge.

This outrage, added to their former resentment, incensed the po∣pulace to such a degree of fury, that a general riot ensued. They plundered and destroyed the house of the lord marechal, and would have sacrificed him to their revenge, had they found him in his own habitation. Luckily for him, he happened to dine that day with the duke of Lancaster, at the house of a foreign merchant, in a different part of the city. Disappointed in this part of their expectation, the multitude proceeded to the palace of the Savoy, belonging to the regent, which they immediately stripped of all its rich fur∣niture, after having murdered a priest who ventured to blame their proceed∣ings. Their intention was to have released Sir Peter de la Mere, and destroy the duke of Lancaster; but, finding neither, they hung up the arms of John reversed, as belonging to a traitor; and would have committed much more t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrible outrages, had not they been pacified by the bishop of London, whose person they revered. The duke and the marechal hastened to Kennington, to advise with the princess of Wales; who, being very popular in the city, sent thither four knights of her domestics to expostulate with the rioters, and represent the iniquity and ill consequences of their proceedings. They forth∣with desisted, in obedience to her commands; but desired the knights to tell the duke of Lancaster, they expected the bishop of Winchester and Sir Peter de la Mere should be tried according to the laws of their country. Then the magistracy sent a deputation to assure his majesty, that they had used their utmost endeavours to prevent this disturbance. The king received them graciously, and admitted of their excuse: but the duke was so incensed at the presumption of the populace, and the injury he had sustained in his effects, that he not only exacted a submission from the chief citizens, but also de∣prived the mayor and aldermen of their offices, and filled their places with<NOTE PLACE="marg">T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>l.</NOTE> his own creatures.</P>

<P>The prolongation of the truce with France being expired, the mi∣litia of England received orders to be in readiness to oppose an invasion, for which the French were supposed to be making preparations.

carried off a considerable booty. This was the last exploit performed by the English, in the reign of Edward, who had lately removed from Eltham to Sheen in Surry, where he sunk into unmanly indolence, and gave himself up to the enjoyment of loose desire in the arms of his favourite concu∣bine. His constitution had been impaired by the fatigues of his youth; so that he began to feel the infirmities of old age before they approach in the common course of nature: and now he was seized with a fever, attended with violent eruptions, that soon put a period to his life. When his dis∣temper became so violent that no hope of his recovery remained, all his at∣tendants forsook him, as a bankrupt no longer able to requite their services; the ungrateful Alice, waiting until she perceived him in the agonies of death, was so inhuman as to strip him of his rings and jewels, and leave him, without one domestic, to close his eyes and do the last offices to his breathless coarse. In this deplorable condition, bereft of comfort and assistance, the mighty Edward lay expiring, when a priest, not quite so savage as the rest of his domestics, approached his bed; and, finding him still breathing, began to administer some spiritual consolation to his soul. Edward had not yet lost all perception: what then must have been his reflections, when he found himself thus abandoned and forlorn in the last moments of his life? He was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. Evesh. Walsingham. Tyrrel.</NOTE> just able to express a deep sense of sorrow and contrition for the errors of his conduct, and died pronouncing the name of Jesus. Such was the piteous and obscure exit of Edward III. undoubtedly one of the greatest princes that ever swayed the scepter of England; whether we respect him as a warrior or law∣giver, a monarch or a man. He possessed the courage and romantic spirit of Alexander; the penetration, the fortitude, the polished manners of Julius; the munificence, the liberality, the wisdom of Augustus Caesar. He was tall, majestic, finely shaped, with a piercing eye, and aquiline visage. He ex∣celled all his cotemporaries in feats of arms and personal address. He was courteous, affable, and eloquent; of a free deportment, and agreeable con∣versation: and had the art of commanding the affection of his subjects with∣out seeming to sollicit popularity. He was a constitutional knight errant; and his example diffused the spirit of chivalry through the whole nation. In imitation of the youthful monarch, who delighted in tilts and tournaments, every individual betook himself to the exercise of arms, every breast glowed with emulation, every heart panted with the thirst of glory; and when he took the field, there was not a soldier in his army who did not serve from sentiment, and fight for reputation. The love of glory was certainly the predominant passion of Edward, to the gratification of which he did not scruple to sacrifice the feelings of humanity, the lives of his subjects, and the interest of his country. And nothing could have induced or enabled his people to bear the load of taxes, with which they were encumbered in this reign, but the love and admiration of his person, the fame of his victories, and the excellent laws and regulations which the parliaments enacted with his advice and concurrence. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was buried in Westminster abbey, near his queen Philippa, by whom he had seven sons and five daughters, namely, Edward the Black Prince; William of Hatfield, who died in the cradle; Lionel of Antwerp, duke of Clarence, who married Elizabeth, heiress of William de Burgh earl of U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er.

<P>The ecclesiastical history of this period turns chiefly upon the dis∣putes between the crown of England and the popes, who, since the shameful resignation of king John, had always looked upon this country as a tributary kingdom and conquered province, which they had a right to rule and impo∣veri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. The English people, under the reign of the first Edward, found the Roman yoke so intolerable, that they began to concert measures for redeem∣ing themselves from such infamous slavery, though not before they had, by repeated complaints, represented their grievances to the court of Rome, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in vain for redress. They complained of the frequent appeals that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged individuals to go and exhaust their time and money, in solliciting causes at the court of Rome; and that the pope had usurped the collation of almost all the benefices of the kingdom, contrary to the rights of the king, the chapters, and patrons. Sometimes his holiness, from the plenitude of his apo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tolic power, reserved to himself the power of filling all the vacancies which arose from translation, death of the incumbent, or any other cause whatsoever: by which means those pontiffs eluded all the canonical elections in England, without advancing any other reason but that they had reserved to themselves, beforehand, the right of filling up the benefice. They had certainly formed the design of engrossing, by little and little, the collation to all the ecclesias∣tical livings in the kingdom: for, when they could not decently pretend to have made such a reservation of a right to nominate, they generally found some objection to the elect, and appointed another in his room; but as those who had been canonically elected, were always supported by the kings of England, the popes found means to evade this opposition, in conferring bishoprics and benefices before they were vacant, by provision, which the English people considered as an unsufferable grievance. This was the more provoking, as the benefices bestowed by the pope's plenitude of power were generally granted to foreigners, cardinals, or their kinsmen, who, by virtue of a dispensation, enjoyed the revenues without residing in the kingdom. These benefices were generally farmed by people who employed curates at very small salaries: the service was neglected; the churches went to ruin; all hos∣pitality was banished; and the practice of instructing people in the duties of
<PB N="115" REF="1170"/>
the christian religion, intirely neglected. Besides these inconveniencies, the money was carried out of the kingdom, to the infinite prejudice of the natives; an hardship that will appear to have been the more severe, if we consider that in the reign of Henry III. the income which foreign ecclesiastics drew from England, exceeded the royal revenue. The popes frequently imposed taxes on the English clergy; sometimes on pretence of crusades; sometimes to re∣lieve the necessities of the holy see; and often by granting tythes to the king, who gratified his holiness with share of the plunder. The clergy of England was obliged to maintain legates and nuncios at a great expence, over and above presents and procurations, which they extorted by virtue of the pope's authority: the annates or first fruits of all benefices were payed to the Roman pontiff; St. Peter's penny was levied with great rigour; and the tribute in∣curred by king John was considered as a most scandalous oppression. At the same time, the clergy industriously encroached upon the civil power and prerogatives of the sovereign: they extended their jurisdiction over all matri∣monial causes; they took cognizance of every dispute in which religion could in any shape be interested; and, instead of supporting the rights and preroga∣tives of the crown, they always espoused the interest of the pope, whom they affected to consider as their only sovereign. These are the principal grie∣vances which the kings and parliaments of England endeavoured, from time to time, to redress, by occasional statutes and ordinances, which furnished the popes with a pretext to complain in their turn, that the church was in danger, and the cause of God neglected and betrayed. Pope Clement V. in a bull, inserted among the public acts, enumerates the following causes of complaint against the conduct of the English government: The cardinals were not al∣lowed to enjoy the prebendaries bestowed upon them, as persons ordained by God to bear a share in the fatigue of the government of the church. Though the pope had incontestably the right to confer benefices in England, as well as in other dominions, those for whom he provided, were not allowed to take possession, nor even to excommunicate such as had the presumption to oppose their endeavours to avail themselves of their right. The citations issued from Rome on this subject, were disregarded: notaries were forbid to publish them, and the natives to answer any appeals out of the kingdom. The pope's nuncios were prohibited from exercising their functions until they should have received the king's licence; and some of them had been confined in public prisons, from whence they had been obliged to purchase their release with considerable sums of money. The magistrates would not suffer excommuni∣cated persons to be imprisoned, even after the forty days allowed them to give satisfaction to the church. The king frequently inhibited ecclesiastical courts from taking cognizance of causes that properly belonged to their province; and even deprived them of jurisdiction over the members of the clergy, with∣out considering that ecclesiastics are altogether independent of lay-tribunals. Clerks were condemned in lay-courts, even without the consent of their supe∣riors: they were obliged to appear in their shirts before civil tribunals, in de∣fiance of their immunities; and though they were remitted to the ecclesiastical court, when reclaimed, they were frequently acquitted and released by lay∣judges, before the ecclesiastical court had taken cognizance of the affair. Clerks were acquitted or condemned by juries of laymen. The nobility
<PB N="116" REF="1180"/>
of the kingdom frequently oppressed the abbeys, by lodging in them at a great expence, under the frivolous pretext that the monasteries had been founded by their ancestors. During the vacancy of abbeys, those whom the king ap∣pointed to take charge of them damaged the premises and wasted the in∣come; and finally, the tribute of a thousand marks due to the holy see was not payed to the pope, but converted to other uses.</P>

<P>These were the causes of complaint reciprocally urged against each other, by the courts of England and Rome, and the subject upon which di∣vers laws and regulations were enacted, as the interest of either chanced to pre∣dominate. At the death of Boniface archbishop of Canterbury, the monks elected their prior William Chiltenden, who going in person to Rome, in order to sollicit the pope's approbation, was persuaded of his own want of capacity to exercise that function; he accordingly resigned the archbishopric, which the pope conferred upon Robert Kilwarby, a Black Friar. This trans∣action happening while Edward I. was in Palestine, the guardians of the kingdom acq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced in the nomination of his holiness, though they protested against any such proceedings for the future; and the monks, in order to pre∣serve<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch 12<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</NOTE> their privilege, confirmed Robert by a new election. Edward, in his re∣turn from the Holy Land, assisted at the council of Lyons, where a new aid was granted for that service; and his holiness sent over a nuncio to collect it from the ecclesiastics of England. In the third year of Edward, a famous sta∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te was enacted at Westminster, providing that a clerk apprehended for fe∣lony shall be delivered to the ordinary, if demanded according to the privilege<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 12<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> of the holy church. In a subsequent parliament at the same place, it was enacted, after a canon passed in the second council of Lyons, that every per∣son twice married should be utterly deprived of all clerical privileges; and that although they were bigamists even before this constitution, justice should be executed upon them as upon other laymen. But this law was repealed in the sequel.</P>

<P>Kilwarby being created a cardinal and bishop of Oporto, he was obliged to abdicate his archbishopric; and the monks of Canterbury chose in his room Robert Burnel bishop of Bath and Wells, who being disagreeable to the court of Rome, the pope filled the see with John Peckham, a Franciscan Friar; and Edward did not think proper to dispute his nomination. When this prelate arrived in England, he convoked a provincial synod at Reading, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erl.</NOTE> which he confirmed the decrees of the council of Lyons against pluralities: then he passed several canons directly levelled against the royal prerogative, denoun∣cing the sentence of excommunication against those who should obtain orders from the king to hinder certain causes from being carried into the ecclesiastical court; against those magistrates who should refuse to imprison excommunicated persons after the forty days granted by the canons; against those who should encroach upon the lands of the clergy, and all who should sell provisions to the archbishop of York within the province of Canterbury. This last canon was contrived to terminate the dispute between the two archbishops about carrying the cross, and had it taken place the prelate of York would have found some difficulty in attending the parliament at London. Edward no sooner understood the purport of these regulations than he ordered Peckham to be summoned before him and his council in parliament, where he revoked
<PB N="117" REF="1190"/>
those canons which seemed to trench upon the prerogative of the crown; and they were accordingly annulled and abolished. The next provincial synod was held at Lambeth, at which the regulars refusing to attend, were prosecuted and punished by the archbishop. This council was convened to review and rein∣force<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1281.</NOTE> the former constitutions, and establish some points of speculative doctrine touching the administration of the sacrament under one species. Peckham is distinguished by the severity of his ecclesiastical discipline, the scrupulous austerity of his own conduct, and his unshaken attachment to the immunities of the church as well as to the papal authority. He censured some opinions of one Knapwell, as heretical; and among others, his asserting the authority of the scriptures over that of the pope and the fathers. He afterwards pub∣lished a set of articles, to be observed by all the parish-priests of his jurisdiction and diocese, regulating their morals and recommending the faithful discharge of their pastoral functions. Several diocesan synods were held in different parts for these laudable purposes, and one in particular at Exeter, for enforcing the constitutions of Otho, Ottobon, and the late synod at Lambeth, touching the adoration of the eucharist. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thorn.</NOTE></P>

<P>After Peckham's death the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant for two years, and then the monks of Christ-church elected Robert Winchel∣sey, who was confirmed by the king and the pope. He set out for Rome to sollicit the pall and confirmation, and during his absence Edward demanded that aid of the clergy which has been already mentioned in the history of his reign. Robert, being informed of this oppression, obtained from Boniface a bull prohibiting the clergy, on pain of excommunication, from paying taxes to the crown, without the consent of his holiness; and this was the source of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> that dissention between the king and the clergy, which last body at length prevailed in the confirmation of the great charter, impowering the archbishops and bishops to denounce the sentence of excommunication against all infrac∣tors of the public liberty. About this period, the Minorites of England of∣fered to pay forty thousand crowns of gold, as a consideration for a bull, im∣powering them to purchase estates and live upon the revenues of their order. The pope understanding that the money was deposited in the hands of a ban∣ker at Rome, seized the prize, for which he gave acquittance and absolution to the banker, and dismissed the deputies without granting their request. The archbishop Winchelsey held a provincial synod at Merton, in which several constitutions were enacted for the better regulation of the clergy; and, in the mean time, Edward, having made a conquest of Scotland, filled up the va∣cant sees of that kingdom. Lamerton was created bishop of Glasgow, not∣withstanding the opposition of the Culdies or Black Monks, who had always enjoyed the right of election. The concessions which Edward had been obliged to make, by the necessity of his affairs, encouraged the pope to make further encroachments. He invested William de Gainborough, who had been pro∣moted to the see of Worcester, with the temporalities as well as with the spiritualities of the diocese; but the king, whose affairs had by this time taken a more favourable turn, not only obliged the prelate to renounce the clause in the bull, touching the temporalities, but ordered him to be fined in a thou∣sand pounds, for having accepted such a grant.</P>

<P>The dispute between the pope and the French king rendering Edward a necessary ally to his holiness, who was a native of Bourdeaux, he resolved to humble the clergy, who had joined the great lords in opposing his arb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rary measures. Winchelsey was accused of having engaged in a conspi∣racy to dethrone the king in favour of the prince of Wales; and know∣ing he lay at the mercy of his majesty, he was deserted by all his former reso∣lution. He kneeled, wept, supplicated, embraced the knees, and implored the blessing of Edward, who, having nothing placable or forgiving in his temper, reproached him bitterly for his past conduct, and told him he should be judged by an eccclesiastical tribunal. He accordingly entered a formal complaint against him with the pope, for crimes amounting to high treason; and his hol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess being rendered propitious by the present of some gold plate, summoned the archbishop to Rome, suspended him from the execution of his office, and sent commissioners to seize his temporalities. Winchelsey, be∣ing thus reduced to the utmost distress, repaired to court and begged Edward would allow him to go abroad, and grant him a safe-guard and protection for the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fety of his person. The king ordering the door of his chamber to be thrown open, that every body might come in and hear the answer he intended to make, "We grant you (said he) a passport to go beyond seas; but you shall have no safeguard or protection for your return: we remember your in∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gues and treasonable practices; out of rever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce for St. Thomas and the church over which you preside, we have delayed taking vengeance upon you by virtue of our own power; but have remitted you to the pope, who we trust will revenge our injur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and treat you as you deserve: we exclude you from our protection and clemency; you have been always merciless, and have no<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> title to mercy." Such an harsh reply must have been extremely mortifying, and doubtless intimidated the archbishop. Such was the inveteracy of the king's revenge, that the monks of Canterbury were ejected from their con∣vent, for having treated him with common humanity in his distress, and the bishop of Winchester was divested of his temporalities, and deprived of the king's protection, because he interceded for the metropolitan, and chanced to call him his lord, in the course of his mediation.

In the last parliament of his reign, con∣vened at Carlile, the remarkable statute De Asportatis Religiosorum was en∣acted in consequence of the remonstrance and complaint of the barons and laity,

who represented that the superiors of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ding on t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e conti∣nent, had made a practice of crossing into Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd; and, und<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tence of visitation, exacted several contributions from the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espective or∣ders established in this kingdom. That same parliament deliberated upon the exactions of the pope, which were managed by his nuncio Testa. They were digested into seven articles, giving an account of the great number of the best spiritual preferments, which the pope had granted by way of provision to Ita∣lians, foreigners, and non residents, in prejudice and disherison of the found∣ers, benefactors, and such as had the rights of advowson; of the rents and re∣venues of religious houses, which the pope intended to apply to the use of divers cardinals; of the first-fruits of vacant benefices, reserved to the pope, and col∣lected with the utmost rigour; of the Peter-pence exacted to treble the original value; of legacies for pious uses, extorted from testators, exacted by the au∣thority of the see of Rome, and converted to other uses, contrary to the inten∣tion of the testator; of the illegal recovery of debts, by bribing the pope's clerks to summon and distrain the creditor, to the disherison of the king and his crown; and of legacies bequeathed in general terms, which the pope and clerks iniquitously appropriated to themselves, or converted to uses contrary to the will of the deceased. Testa, the pope's agent, being brought before the parliament, and examined touching these mal-practices, did not pretend to deny the charge, but justified his conduct in affirming that he acted by the pope's authority. It was therefore resolved that the aforesaid grievances, oppressions, injuries, and extortions, ought not to be permitted in the kingdom; and Testa was enjoined to revoke and annual all such extortions practised by himself, his commissaries, ministers, vicegerents, adherents, and assistants, and safely deposite the money he had levied, until he should receive further directions from his majesty. A remonstrance upon this subject was drawn up, in the form of a letter from the parliament to the pope; and all the agents of Testa were ordered to be prosecuted with the utmost severity. These vigorous mea∣sures were owing intirely to the spirit of the people, and not at all agreeable to the king, the situation of whose affairs in Scotland and Guienne would not admit of a rupture with the pope. He therefore, after the recess of par∣liament, put a stop to the writs of prosecution, granted a protection to the per∣son of Testa, and Amalmeni the other agent of the pope, and granted divers privileges to the court of Rome, which were altogether inconsistent with the proceedings of parliament. The agents grew insolent upon this triumph over the constitution, and the papal tyranny revived: but, by this time the people were better informed; they adhered to the resolutions of the parliament, and refused to submit to the imposition of the papal agents. Both sides pre∣sented addresses to the king, who found the popular resentment so warm, that far from countenancing the agents in their oppression, he inhibited them from proceeding to exact the annates or first-fruits of benefices, and interfere with the patronage of the king or his subjects.</P>

<P>Upon the accession of Edward II. to the crown of England, the pope desired to know whether the accusation brought by the late king against Winchelsey should be prosecuted or dropped; and Edward not only sent an answer in favour of the culprit, but also invited him, by the appellation of Father, to return and resume the dignities and duties of his function.

Though Winchelsey seized every opportunity of expressing his gratitude to Edward II. and exerted all his influence to allay the animosity between the king and peo∣ple, with respect to Gaveston's banishment, he would not recede from any part of the honour which he thought due to the dignity of his character, even when Edward took umbrage at his inflexibility. He refused to attend a par∣liament, in which the archbishop of York appeared with his cross borne before him; and being seconded by the clergy of his province, Edward was obliged to dismiss the other metropolitan. He afterwards thwarted the king's inclina∣tions, by adhering to Peckham's constitution against pluralities, which Ed∣ward desired him to wave in behalf of a favourite chaplain; and so long as he lived he tenaciously supported the rights and privileges of the clergy against all opposition. His private conduct was certainly irreproachable: he censured sinners without respect of persons; he rewarded merit; discouraged all in∣trigues for church-preferment; and after his death, his memory was held in such veneration, that miracles were said to be performed at his tomb, which was at length pulled down, that it might no longer encourage the superstition of the populace.</P>

Upon the death of Winchelsey, the monks chose Cobham dean of Salisbury as his successor; but that election was superseded by the king and the pope, who concurred in the nomination of Walter Reynolds bishop of Worcester, chancellor of the kingdom, whose interest was so great that he acquired a papal authority in England, by virtue of the bulls which he pur∣chased of his holiness. By one of these, the jurisdiction of the suffragans of Canterbury was suspended for the term of three years, during which he was empowered to make provincial visitations, even in places that were exempted by their charters from this intrusion. He was vested with the power of dis∣pensing with an hundred clerks, under age, to hold benefices; and of giving absolution to an hundred persons, for having laid violent hands upon eccle∣siastics: he obtained leave to wave the canons against pluralities, in favour of forty clergymen; to dispose of any single ecclesiastical preferment, belonging to

<P>About this period, the famous statute called Articuli Cleri was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The statute is couched in form of a petition to the king; and his answer is subjoined to every article. They complained that the king's justices intermeddled in testamentary causes, and took cognizance of tythes; that ecclesiastics were charged towards the king's carriages; that the king's mills were exempted from the payment of tythes; that clerks attend∣ing on the exchequer could not reside in their benefices; that, upon their de∣cease, their effects were seized until their accounts were made up; that eccle∣siastical possessions were wasted during vacancies; that clerks were admitted to free chapels by laymen; that the king's judges tried causes of usury, defama∣tion, violence offered to ecclesiastics, sacrilege, oblations, fences of church∣yards and mortuaries; that prohibitions were granted without surmise; that clerks were summoned to answer in the king's court, and though acquitted, the informers escaped with impunity; that clerks were not allowed their clergy; that, after purgation, clerks were questioned in the king's court for the same offence; that persons were besieged in sanctuary; that the writ De Cautione admittenda was issued forth, although the church was not satisfied; and excom∣municated persons were released from prison in the same irregular manner; that causes relating to debts between ecclesiastics, were de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermined in the tem∣poral courts; that bishops were compelled by distress to be forthcoming for the appearance of clerks in the lay courts, even without cause; that the church forfeited its right, by the ceasing of rent or pension for the space of two years; that nuns were compelled to sue in lay-courts, for the rights of possession de∣volving to them by the decease of their kindred; that churches were deprived of their privileges, in default of shewing the Quo Warranto by which they were held; that the proceedings of ecclesiastical judges were stopped by she∣riffs and noblemen; that the refusals of bishops, touching clerks presented, were examined in lay-courts; that religious houses were oppressed, by their patrons living upon them at free quarter; that bigamy and bastardy were tried in lay-courts; that the king's livings remained long vacant; and that the clergy were injured by the statute of Mortmain. It was for the redress of these grievances, that Edward passed the statute of Articuli Cleri, which, in all pro∣bability, the clergy owed to the civil distractions of the kingdom, during which the king could not venture to disoblige such a formidable body, whole cause the pope had espoused: nevertheless he made some efforts against the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣croachments of the papal authority. Lewis Beaumont, having being appointed bishop of Durham by the pope, who invested him with the temporal as w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll as spiritual jurisdiction, Edward obliged him to renounce the former, upon his performing homage for his preferment; and Reginald de Asser, being pro∣moted to the see of Winchester with the same privileges, was obliged to re∣nounce them in the same manner.</P>

These stories being industriously circulated by the monks of Pontefract, where that nobleman's body was interred, and countenanced by the clergy of St. Paul's in London, the king ordered the church of the priory of Pontefract to be shut up, and severely reprimanded the ecclesiastics of St. Paul's cathedral. Towards the end of his reign, he sollicited the pope's consent to the dissolution of some small sees in Ireland, that they might be annexed to those that were of more consequence, to be filled with English prelates, as the most natural expedient to keep the natives in order.

<P>In the beginning of the third Edward's reign, while the queen sat at the helm of government, the pope was thwarted in his designs upon the see of Exeter. He had reserved it for his own disposal; but at the queen's recom∣mendation Berkeley was elected, and consecrated by the archbishop of Canter∣bury, who did not long survive this ceremony; for he was so bitterly reproached by the pope, for having presumed to contradict his will, that he drooped and died under his displeasure, leaving behind him the character of a weak and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1328.</NOTE> worthless prelate. Mepham canon of Chichester was elected as his successor in the see of Canterbury, and by dint of money procured the confirmation of the pope at Avignon. At his return to England, he held a provincial council at St. Paul's in London, where the anniversary of the Conception was appointed as a festival; several constitutions were enacted against violators of eccle∣siastical immunities, and those who obstructed the testaments of villains apper∣tinent to lands, or of any other of a servile condition. In the course of this year, a dispute happened between the crown, and Lewis Beaumont bishop of Durham. The king had ordered the estates of several traitors to be seized within the bishopric, and Lewis opposing these proceedings as contrary to the privilege of the diocese, which was a county palatine, the cause was heard be∣fore the lords, who gave judgment in favour of the bishop. Mepham pro∣ceeded with a high hand in making his visitations to the dioceses of Rochester, Chichester, Salisbury, Bath and Wells, but was opposed with an armed force by Grandison bishop of Exeter, who enjoyed the king's countenance; so that the metropolitan was obliged to desist, and died in a little time after this dis∣pute. The king recommended John Stratford, bishop of Winchester, as a person fit to fill the see of Canterbury; and this prelate being approved by the pope and the monks of Christ Church, the see of Winchester was bestowed upon Adam Orleton bishop of Hereford, who had been so instrumental in the death of Edward II. As the reigning king had given orders to prosecute all who were suspected of having been concerned in the murder of his father, he affected displeasure at Orleton's promotion; and he was impeached in the court of Rome in several articles, to which he gave such answers as were satisfactory; for the prosecution was dropped, and he continued to have a large share in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

We have already given an account of the differ∣ence between the king and archbishop Stratford, and of the statute which was
<PB N="123" REF="1250"/>
enacted in favour of the clergy; we shall now observe, that after he had got the better of his prosecution, he convoked a provincial synod at London, where a body of canons was enacted, obliging parishes belonging to monas∣teries, to answer the religious purposes for which they were endowed, by dis∣tributing to the poor a proportionable share of their incomes; settling the fees upon inventories and administrations of estates; restraining the exorbitancy of archdeacons and other spiritual superiors, who made a practice of extorting procurations from churches which they never saw, and burthening the clergy in their visitations; reforming the abuses in commutation of corporal penance; and preventing collusive inductions into livings.</P>

<P>In a subsequent provincial synod held by the same archbishop, other<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The rest were calculated for preventing clandestine marriages, as well as the encroachment of lay noblemen, who frequently in∣terfered with the ecclesiastical officer, in the article of testaments made by vil∣lains, whom the lord of the manor wanted to exclude from that privilege; for providing against the contempt of church-censures; the practice of cutting down trees in church-yards for lay uses; for deterring all persons from violating such effects as were sequestred by the bishop, his vicar-general, and principal official; and for reforming the abuse of taking out writs against people who were at a distance, and entirely ignorant of the prosecution.</P>

<P>When Stratford archbishop of Canterbury died, Thomas Bradwar∣din<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This prelate dying of the plague before his consecration, the convent re-elected Bradwardin, who was confirmed by his holiness at Avig∣non. He was remarkable for his learning, piety, and unblemished morals, and had acted as confessor to Edward, who was loth to deprive himself of such a spiritual director, and for that reason had at first opposed his promotion. He too died within the year of his election, and was succeeded by Simon Islip, who had been secretary of state and keeper of the privy seal: he affected great au<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erity of manners, and proceeded severe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y against those ecclesiastics who were found g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilty of the least immorality.

<P>About this period died William Bateman bishop of Norwich, a prelate of untainted morals, and an eminent patron of learning; but so rigo∣rous in the performance of his function, that he obliged the lord Morley, a favourite of king Edward, who had shot some of his deer, to do public pe∣nance, by walking barefoot, with a taper in his hand, through the city of Norwich to the cathedral, where he asked pardon of the bishop for his offence. The king issued a writ, commanding him to dispense with the performance of this penance, but he payed no regard to the mandate; and even refused to
<PB N="125" REF="1270"/>
comply, after the king had seized his temporalities. Though Edward was at first provoked at his inflexibility, he could not help admiring his fortitude, and not only restored his temporalities, but also employed him in the manage∣ment of some important state affairs. He had obtained a bull from pope Clement VI. annexing to his see the first fruits of all the vacant benefices in his diocese; and he died at Avignon, where he chanced to be on an embassy to the pope. In the course of the same year, Fitz-Ralph archbishop of Ar∣magh in Ireland distinguished himself by opposing, with great spirit, the principles of the Mendicants, whom he accused of encroaching upon the bishops and parochial clergy; and of engaging in a voluntary vow of beg∣gary, which was contrary to the dictates of reason and scripture. The order being in high favour with the pope, procured a citation to the archbishop, summoning him to appear before his holiness at Avignon, to answer for the propositions he had advanced. He obeyed the mandate, and maintained his assertions with great energy and learning. He moreover exposed the igno∣rance and immorality of the Mendicants, to the conviction of all mankind: but they were too hard for him in point of interest; and he died at Avigno<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, without having been able to prevent the confirmation of their privileges.</P>

<P>During these transactions, the bishop of Ely involved himself in a long train of prosecutions, by incurring the king's displeasure. He was con∣victed of having abetted certain incendiaries, who had burned some houses belonging to the lady Blanche Wake, daughter of the duke of Lancaster. The cause was afterwards reheard, upon a commission of oyer and terminer; but the court would not reverse the sentence, because the record of the former trial could not be found. The bishop being a man of an impatient temper, hurried up to court, and reproached the king for denying him justice. Ed∣ward, incensed at his presumption, ordered him to be prosecuted before the parliament. Though the offence was plainly proved, and the other bishops interceded for him on their knees, he refused to join in the supplication; and the king was provoked afresh at the insolence of his deportment. Imme∣diately after this trial, he was prosecuted for harbouring an assassin, who had murdered a domestic of the lady Wake; and, as the parliament was not sitting, he was denied the privilege of being tried by his peers. He had re∣course to the archbishop of Canterbury, desiring he might be admitted to his purgation, by swearing himself innocent, or by the oaths of twelve respon∣sible compurgators: but the metropolitan being afraid of embroiling himself with Edward, declined granting his request, and advised him to throw him∣self on the king's mercy. The haughty prelate would not stoop to this con∣descension, but fled to Avignon, where he interested the pope so warmly in his behalf, that the king's justices were summoned to appear before his holi∣ness, and give an account of their proceedings against the bishop of Ely. The judges disregarding this citation, the pope excommunicated their persons, and laid their estates under interdict; and the king being unwilling to break with the court of Avignon, ordered his agents to compromise the affair; but the bishop died before an accommodation could be effected. Archbishop Islip not only reformed the discipline of the church, by watching over the morals of the cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgy, and publishing some wholesome constitutions against the avarice, sloth, and extravagance of ecclesiastics, but likewise acted up to

had long resided at the papal court, and was equally disagreeable to the people and the king. Gregory XI. who had lately succeeded pope Urban, resolved to improve this misunderstanding between Edward and the monks of Canter∣bury; and proposed that Simon Sudbury should be translated from the diocese of London to the see of Canterbury, without paying any regard to the monkish election, which he looked upon as an obstruction to the papal power in England. Edward inadvertently embraced this insidious proposal; and Sudbury, otherwise Tibbald, was consecrated metropolitan, contrary to the inclinations of the people, who had no other objection to his person but the manner in which he was elevated to that dignity. He was succeeded in the see of London by Courtenay, son to the earl of Devonshire, a prelate of un∣common spirit and capacity.</P>

<HEAD>§ LVIII.</HEAD>
<P>By this time Wickliff began to distinguish himself by his doc∣trines, under the protection of the duke of Lancaster, who had provided <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or him in the rectory of Lutterworth, in the diocese of Lincoln. He is said to have quarrelled with a monk about the rectorship of Canterbury college in Oxford; his antagonist being supported by the archbishop and the monks of Canterbury, the dispute was appealed to the pope, who decided it against Wickliff, and thenceforward became the object of his implacable revenge. This seems to be no more than a malicious imputation forged by Wickliff's enemies; for he had avowed his tenets, and even made some proselytes in England, before the date of this contention. He maintained that the bread and wine in the eucharist was not the real substance, but only a type of Christ's body: that the church of Rome is not supreme over all other churches; and that Christ did not give greater power to Peter than to the rest of the apostles: that a lay-patron may lawfully and meritoriously divest a degenerate church of her temporalities: that the gospel is sufficient for regulating the life and morals of every christian; and that all other rules of sanctity add no more perfection to the gospel, than whiteness adds to a wall: that neither the pope, nor any christian prelate, ought to punish or confine delinquents; but that every indi∣vidual should do whatsoever seemed good in his own eyes, until he is appre∣hended by the civil magistrate. Wickliff and his followers affected a remark∣able<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bibliotheque Angloite.</NOTE> austerity in their way of living, which impressed the vulgar with an high opinion of their sanctity; and the doctrine in favour of lay-patrons was so agreeable to the nobility in general, who wanted to humble the clergy, that he soon numbered a vast multitude of common people, and some of the most powerful lords of the kingdom, among his converts. The pope being in∣formed of his tenets and success, sent a bull, directed to the metropolitan of Canterbury and the bishop of London, requiring them to seize and secure the person of this arch-heretic; and they, unwilling to proceed at once to extre∣mities, contented themselves with summoning him to a synod convened at St. Paul's in London. Thither he went, accompanied by his two chief patrons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1377.</NOTE> the duke of Lancaster and the lord Percy, who insisted upon Wickliff's being seated, although he appeared as a delinquent; and endeavoured to intimi∣date the bishop of London, by unmanly threats and boisterous language, which excited no passion but contempt in that spirited prelate, who knew he had nothing to fear from their resentment, while he retained his popularity. The lower class of people in London had not yet imbibed the doctrines of
<PB N="128" REF="1300"/>
Wickliff, whom they were taught to detest as an impious heretic; and, being warmly attached to the person of the bishop, they had crouded the streets in such a manner, that the duke of Lancaster could hardly find ad∣mittance. When they understood that the dispute began to grow warm between him and the prelate, and were informed that Lancaster had even threatened to pull him out of the church by the hair of the head, they im∣mediately took the alarm, and grew so obstreperous, that the duke and lord Percy, with their favouri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Wickliff, were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain to retreat in a hurry;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> though the synod inflicted no other punishment but that of imposing silence upon this new apostle.</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Edward III. resigned his breath, his grandson and suc∣cessor<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1377.</NOTE> Richard II. had not yet attained the tenth year of his age; and, as his uncle John of Ghent had all the power of England in his hands, he might, in imitation of several princes who had ascended the English throne, have set aside the lineal heir without the least difficulty, had he been really in∣fected with that ambition of reigning, which had been fixed as an imputation upon his character. This charge he owed to the resentment of the monks and clergy, who hated him as the protector of Wickliff. He had, moreover, ac∣quired a great number of enemies by the pride, arrogance, and irascibility of his temper; and he was particularly detested by the citizens of London for the vengeance he had taken on account of the late insurrection. We can hardly suppose that he was intimidated from pursuing his designs upon the crown by the sense of the nation, which adored the young Richard, both for his personal beauty and accomplishments, and for the sake of his father, whose memory they revered, even to a degree of enthusiasm. The duke of Lancaster was naturally bold and confident<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and, upon all occasions, ex∣pressed the utmost contempt for the people: nor, indeed, could he have had any just cause of appr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hension from their enmity, while all the places of strength in the kingdom were occupied by his creatures, and all the veteran officers at his devotion.</P>

<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>On the very day of Edward's death, John Philpot, with the principal citizens of London, deputed by the common council, repaired to Kingston upon Thames, where the young prince then resided, and implored his favour and protection to the city of London, expressing their concern at his being re∣moved so far from the capital, and assuring him they would venture their lives and fortunes for his service. They concluded their address with a peti∣tion that he would take up his residence in the city, and put a stop to the pro∣secutions which had been set on foot by the duke of Lancaster. Their request was granted, and all differences compromised by commissioners sent to Lon∣don for that purpose; and Richard the very next day made a magnificent en∣try into London, attended by the dukes of Lancaster and Brittany, the arch∣bishop of Canterbury, the bishop of Winchester, the earls of Marche and Warwick, with many other noblemen. The duke still continued at the head of the administration, and issued out orders for guarding the coast, erecting new beacons at convenient places, for the purpose of giving the alarm in case the kingdom should be invaded, and even for arraying the clergy for the de∣fence of their country. These precautions were highly necessary; for the French, having equipped a navy, and being reinforced by the fleet of Castile, scoured the channel, landed at Hastings, ravaged the isle of Wight, and laid<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham.

<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>A parliament being called about Michaelmas, to concert measures for opposing the progress of the French, the commons would not give their opinions on the subject of their deliberations, without the advice and assistance of the duke of Lancaster, and a committee of four bishops, four earls, and as many barons, whom they nominated for that purpose; and the king who was present assented to the proposal. Then the duke, falling upon his knees before his majesty, desired he might be excused from assisting at the confe∣rence, as the commons had traduced his character, and suspected him of having formed designs which amounted to high treason. He protested his own innocence in the most solemn manner; and declared that if any person would openly charge him with high treason, disloyalty, or any action preju∣dicial to the realm, he was ready to prove the falsity and malice of the accu∣sation, either in single combat or in any other manner that the king and the lords should direct. The prelates and lords, standing up as one man, inter∣rupted him in his harrangue, protesting they could not imagine any person upon earth would advance such a malicious charge; and the commons al∣leged, that in chusing him as the principal counsellor, they had clearly mani∣fested their opinion of his honour. The duke, having represented the evil consequences of such reports as might create jealousies between the king and his best subjects, declared that he forgave the authors of such slander, but ex∣pressed a desire that a law should be made against the inventors and propaga∣tors of defamation. The commons, considering the situation of the kingdom and the minority of the king, proposed that certain persons of unblemished morals and undoubted capacity should be appointed in parliament, as the king's constant counsellors, to act in the administration, with the great offi∣cers of the crown, and direct the application of the money granted for the prosecution of the French war. Nine persons were accordingly chosen by the lords, and sworn of the council: their trust was limited to one year, during which they were absolutely prohibited from receiving any grant of lands, rent, escheat, ward, or marriage. The commons likewise petitioned that the parliament should appoint the servants of his majesty; that the charges of the houshold should be born by the revenue of the crown; and that the supplies granted for the war should be applied to that purpose only. The lords de∣clined joining in this motion, because they thought it unreasonable to place any servants about the king's person but such as he himself should approve; and with regard to the expences of the houshold they promised to confer with the great officers, and inquire whether or not they might be honourably de∣srayed by the crown revenue. The next request of the commons was, that during the king's minority, the chancellor, treasurer, chief justices, and other officers of the crown, should be appointed by parliament; but this mo∣tion was likewise opposed by the lords, who assumed to themselves the right
<PB N="134" REF="1360"/>
of nominating the counsellors, chancellor, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> steward of the houshold, and insist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon leaving the other officers to the king's choice, with the advice and assent of his council. Notwithstanding this opposition on the part of the lords, the commons voted a consid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y supply for the defence of the kingdom, on condition that the money should be deposited in the hands of two trustees; and John Philpot and William Walworth merchants in London were appointed for that office. Having granted this aid, they thought they had a right to demand that the evil counsellors placed about the late king should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e removed, and their posts bestowed upon persons of good morals and i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>grity. Several officers were displaced in consequence of this petition; but they did not succeed in another, requesting that a parliament should be con∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed once a year to regulate the affairs of the nation, and determine those causes about which the judges were divided in their opinions. In this assem∣bly, Sir Richard Lescrop steward of the houshold impeached Alice Perrers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a breach of the ordinance which had been made expresly against her in t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e last parliament. She was accused of having procured the pardon of Lyons, and an order to revoke the commission of Sir Nicholas Dagworth, who had been appointed to inspect the administration of her own husband William de Windsor, in Ireland. She made no defence, nor did she appear in per∣son or by proxy; the duke of Lancaster, though one of the committee ap∣pointed to examine into the affair, condescended to give evidence in this cause. She was condemned to banishment, and all her estate sorfeited; but in the next parliament she obtained a revision of the trial and a reversion of the sentence, together with a full pardon to herself and husband. This affair being dis∣cussed, the commons made remonstrances against papal usurpation in pro∣visions, the admission of aliens into benefices, and the commutation of penance<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> for money.</P>

<P>Immediately after this session broke up, the duke of Lancaster, on pretence of taking measures for the defence of the kingdom and annoyance of the enemy, demanded an order from the lords of the council, to withdraw the money from the hands of the two trustees; and his desire being complied with, he engaged in the service nine large ships of Bayonne, with which he attacked a fleet of French merchantmen, and took fourteen vessels laden with wine. At the same time, alderman Philpot equipped a small armament at his own ex∣pence; and sailing in quest of one Mercer, a Scottish mariner, who had greatly interrupted the navigation on the northern coasts of England, engaged and took him, together with fifteen Spanish ships which had entered into his ser∣vice. This exploit, though universally applauded by the people, gave um∣brage to the government; and Philpot was summoned before the council-board, where he received a reprimand for having undertaken such an expedition con∣trary to law; but in respect of his character, and the service he had done the nation, he was no further questioned on the subject. The Scots not only com∣mitted depredations on the sea, but commenced hostilities at land, notwith∣standing a truce which had been lately concluded between the two kingdoms. They <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound means to surprize the town and castle of Berwick; though this adventure was atchieved by a small number of freebooters, who had no com∣mission from the government of Scotland; and the Scottish earl of Marche offered to assist the earl of Northumberland, in reducing the place under the
<PB N="135" REF="1370"/>
English dominion. The earl of Northumberland, assembling a body of ten thousand men, marched to Berwick, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le to surrender, Ramsay, who commanded the garrison, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place had been taken by virtue of a commission from the king of France, in whose name he would defend it to the last extremity. An assault was immediately given, and the place being taken, every Scot was put to the sword. The earl, suspecting that the Scottish ministry connived at Ramsay's adventure, resolved to chastise them for their insincerity; and being joined by the earl of Nottingham, the lords Lacy, Neville, and Stratford, he began his march towards Mclro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. Sir Thomas Musgrave, being detached with six hundred men to reconn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itre the country, fell into an ambush laid by the earl of Douglas, who routed and took him prisoner, and guarded the passes in such a manner, that Percy thought proper to desist from his enterprize, and return to England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>During these petty operations in the north, the duke of Lancaster<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1378.</NOTE> was employed in making gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t preparations for invading the dominions of the French king, who had by this time reduced all the places belonging to the king of Navarre in Normandy, except Cherbourg, which was defended by an English garrison. Charles of France had detected a plot, in which the king of Navarre had contrived to poison him. A domestic belonging to that prince, in the service of his two sons, who resided as hostages in Paris, was employed as the perpetrator of this scheme, and being apprehended, at once confessed the particulars: the secretary of the king of Navarre, being afterwards taken and put to the torture, confirmed the other's confession, and both were executed as traitors. The king of Navarre was stripped of Normandy, and all the do∣minions he held of France; and the king of Castile fell upon Navarre, where he gained several considerable advantages. The duke of Lancaster having pro∣vided his fleet and forces, set sail, about the latter end of July, for St. Malo, which was then in possession of the French, and took or destroyed a fleet of French and Spanish vessels, lying laden with wine and other commodities in the harbour: then landing his forces he invested the city, which was defended by a brave officer, at the head of a numerous garrison. The constable of France, being then in Brittany, advanced with sixteen thousand choice troops, and encamped in sight of the English, from whom he was divided by a rivulet. The duke of Lancaster endeavoured to provoke him to battle, which he stu∣diously avoided, in obedience to the order he had received; but he posted him∣self in such a manner, that the besiegers could not carry on their assaults, with∣out dangerous interruption from his army, which he kept always in readiness to seize every advantage. At length the garrison made a furious sally, in which they destroyed the works, and killed a great number of the besiegers; a dis∣aster which the duke imputed to the want of vigilance and conduct in the earl of Arundel, who commanded that night in the trenches. The English being dispirited by this check, as well as by the vivacity of the constable, by whom they were incessantly harrassed, and the winter approaching, it was resolved, in a council of war, that the troops should be reimbarked; and the French allowed them to retire without molestation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">H. de Bretag.</NOTE></P>

<P>The citizens of London had another additional motive of resentment ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the duke of Lancaster, who was supposed to have prevailed upon the king to summon the ensuing parliament to meet at Gloucester, with a view to
<PB N="137" REF="1390"/>
mortify the city of London. The members being there assembled on the twen∣tieth day of October, Richard Lescrop, steward of the houshold, opened the session with a speech, representing the danger to which the nation was exposed from the enemies that surrounded it, and the considerable supplies necessary to secure Calais; and Brest, which, by a treaty with the duke of Bretagne, was deposited in the hands of the English, as well as Cherbourg; and for the de∣fence of Bourdeaux and Bayonne, which were threatened by the duke of Anjou and the king of Castile. The commons suspecting that part of the late subsidies had been embezzled, or converted to other uses than those for which they were granted, insisted upon knowing in what manner those sums had been expended, and who were intended to fill the great offices of state for the ensuing year, according to the ordinance of the last parliament. Lescrop answered, in the king's name, that although no account of subsidies or other grants had ever been made to the commons, William Walworth, in conjunction with some members of the council, should lay before them an account of the receipts and disbursements; but that such condescension should not be drawn into precedent. He told them, that the officers of state had been chosen by the advice of the lords, and the king would appoint the privy counsellors according to his own judgment; but if the commons found any thing defective either in the laws or the administration, they might represent it in the usual form of petition; and their grievances should be redressed. Then they desired a copy of the enrol∣ment of the last subsidy, that they might deliberate upon the subject; and this request being granted as a special favour, they took exceptions to the sum of six and forty thousand pounds expended upon fortresses abroad, which they alledged ought to have been maintained out of the king's own revenue and pa∣trimonial estate. After these deliberations, the parliament granted a consider∣able aid on wool and leather, besides an additional duty upon merchandize for one year; but this was in the next session revoked, and in lieu of it, a poll-tax laid upon all orders of men throughout the kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

Ch. 1379.</NOTE> was recalled from his government, and, together with Sir Thomas Percy, created admiral of England, in which station he acted with his usual vigilance, bravery, and conduct, so as to interrupt the enemy's trade; while the earl of Salisbury, who succeeded him in the government of Calais, took every oppor∣tunity of harrassing the French by land. By this time the important fortress of Auray, the last inland place possessed by the duke of Brittany, was reduced by the French forces; so that after having consigned Brest to Richard, in ex∣change for an estate in England, he had abandoned his own country, and be∣come altogether a British subject. Charles king of France having made him∣self master of the whole dutchy, except the town of Brest, which he had in vain attempted to reduce, resolved to confiscate the whole province, and re-annex
<PB N="138" REF="1400"/>
it to the dominion of France. For this purpose, he summoned all the peers to attend the parliament at Paris, where, by a solemn decree, John de Montfort was pronounced a traitor, and the dutchy of Bretagne forfeited, and re-united to the crown of France.</P>

<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>This sentence was extremely disagreeable, even to those lords of Brit∣tany who had been hitherto attached to the interest of Charles. He had not consulted them on this occasion; and when he afterwards sent for them to court, and tried to cajole them with promises of favour, they loudly com∣plained of his having proceeded to such extremities without their concurrence, refused to put his troops in possession of their castles, for the defence of the country against the attempts of the English and Montfort, and retiring to Brittany, engaged in associations to maintain their liberties against all incroach∣ment. They even renounced all dependence upon the crown of France, and sent a deputation to England, inviting their duke to return to his own domi∣nions, where they would support him with their lives and fortunes. John could not help distrusting the sincerity of this profession, made by people who had so long acted as his open enemies; and dismissed the deputies, with a gene∣ral promise of crossing the sea with the first favourable opportunity. Before they returned, the king of France had sent commissaries into Bretagne, to execute the sentence of confiscation; and at the same time letters patent were published, confirming all the privileges of the nobility. But even this indulgence could not induce them to submit; and the French government was so odious to the people, that the commissaries, being denied admittance into Nantes and other places, were ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iged to return to Anjou, without having executed their com∣mission. A war being the immediate consequence of this opposition, the estates of Brittany sent a solemn invitation in writing, under the seals of the principal nobility, to the duke, pressing him to return without delay, and as∣suring him, that all the barons and the most considerable towns of the pro∣vince, would declare for him at his landing. John, at length convinced of their attachment, embarked at Southampton, with Sir Robert Knolles and a small body of troops, and landing at Solidor, in the neighbourhood of St. Malo, was received with joyful acclamation. Dinan, Rennes, and Vannes, opened their gates to their sovereign: he was joined by almost the whole no∣blesse of the province; the Bretons in the French service deserted to him in such numbers that Charles dismissed all that remained, because he could not de∣pend upon their fidelity. By these the duke's army was considerably reinforced: towns and fortresses daily declared in his favour; nor could the forces, under the duke of Bourbon and the constable Du Guesclin prevent this almost uni∣versal defection. In this emergency the duke of Anjou, advancing to the frontiers of Brittany, endeavoured to conciliate the affection of the natives, by promises of favour and professions of good will; and a negotiation was set on soot, but France still insisting upon Brittany's being united to the crown, the conferences proved ineffectual.</P>

<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>The constable advised the king of France to pardon the duke of Bretagne, and detach him by dint of kind offices from his dependence upon England. In that case he might engage the hardy soldiers of that province in his service, and employ his whole force in the reduction of Guienne, where the English had lately retaken several places of importance. Charles was
<PB N="139" REF="1410"/>
inclined to follow this advice; but in the mean time he sent Guesclin with a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> army to check the progress of the English in that province. He undertook the siege of Chateauneuf, which was gallantly defended; and in the course of the operations he fell sick and died, just when the garrison was on the point of demanding a capitulation. The French king had, by means of this great officer, begun to tamper with Montfort, who was not averse to an accom∣modation; but the death of the constable, and the duke's expectation of suc∣cours from England, rendered the treaty abortive. A considerable armament was actually intended for his assistance: but, a war breaking out between the count of Flanders and his subjects, the Flemings did not purchase such quantities of wool as they used to employ; so that the subsidy granted upon that commodity fell short of expectation, and the number of troops destined for Brittany was curtailed. Nevertheless Sir John Arundel set sail in De∣cember for that dutchy with a body of forces; but, being overtaken by a storm, his fleet was dispersed and he himself perished. Such was the distress of the government, that the king was obliged to pawn his jewels to raise mo∣ney for this purpose, though no provision was made for paying the garrisons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham. Froissart.</NOTE> of Cherbourg, Calais, and the borders of Scotland.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>To remove these necessities, and provide for the expence of the en∣suing campaign, a parliament was called at Westminster, and the session opened by a speech from the chancellor, who encouraged the commons to ex∣plain their grievances; and gave them to understand that the king had ordered his great officers and others of his council to lay before them an accompt of the money received from the last subsidy, and of the manner in which it had been disbursed. The commons, impatient under their burthensome taxes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1380.</NOTE> and disliking the conduct and oeconomy of the council, moved that the king might be of age, and take upon himself the administration, under the direction of the chancellor, treasurer, privy seal, chamberlain, and steward of the hous∣hold, who should be appointed by parliament. Though this request was de∣nied, they obtained the renewal of a commission which in the last session had been granted to several prelates and noblemen, impowering them to ex∣amine into the state of the revenue, the expences of the king's houshold, the management of the war, and the conduct of officers. John Imperiale the Genoese ambassador having been murdered in the streets of London, both houses joined in declaring the perpetrators guilty of high treason. The power of justices of the peace was lodged in a new commission: a statute was enacted against papal provisions, in consequence of the rapacious conduct of pope Urban, who had lately bestowed the archdeaconry of Bath upon the cardi∣nal of Cisteron, a professed enemy of the English, gratified another with the priory of Deerhust, and granted a great number of provisions to foreigners, in violation of the agreement between the late king and this pontiff's prede∣cessor. After having made these regulations, the parliament voted a consi∣derable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl.</NOTE> aid, and continued the subsidy on wool for a year longer.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>These supplies, together with a tenth given by the clergy, enabled the ministers to equip a new armament for the assistance of the duke of Brittany. Thomas of Wodestoke earl of Buckingham was appointed commander in chief of the army, which consisted of three thousand archers, as many men at arms with their followers, and a numerous body of infantry. He was accompanied by
<PB N="140" REF="1420"/>
the lord Basset, Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Hugh Calverly, Sir John Harleston, Sir Robert Knowles, Sir William de Windsor, and a great number of young gentlemen, who sought an opportunity to distinguish themselves in the service. As the ships were not sufficient to transport such a numerous army with its ne∣cessaries at once, the general could not sail directly for Bretagne; but was obliged to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t over the troops at different times from Dover and Sandwich to Cala<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s: and this method, together with some other unaccountable delays in the ministry, detained the soldiers so long upon the coast, that numbers were obliged to pawn their arms for subsistence. This evil however was remedied by the zeal of some London merchants, and John Philpot in particular, who not only payed the debts of the soldiery, and redeemed their arms, but also hired transports to convoy them to the continent. The earl of Buckingham, landing at Calais in the latter end o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> July, tarried a few days until his army was r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>treshed; and then began his march for Brittany. He met with no opposition in his progress, though the dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon were posted with a strong body of forces at Troyes. He proposed to attack them in their intrenchments; but they, being unwilling to stand an attack, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired within the walls of the city. Buckingham, having attempted in vain to provoke them to a general engagement, continued his march through Sens, from whence he proceeded through the Gatinois and Beauce into Le Maine; and passed the Sarte on the sixteenth day of September, remarkable for the death of Charles V. king of France. That prince had lately by his emissaries excited the jealousy and antient prejudice of the Bretons against the English, whom they represented as cruel usurpers who wanted to make a conquest of their country; so that the natives looked upon them with abhorrence, and the citizens of Nantes denied them admittance. John de Montfort, dreading the consequences of this animosity, and believing it would be no difficult task to effect an advantageous accommodation with the ministry of the young French monarch, as yet a minor, was not a little perplexed in his mind with regard to his auxiliaries, and hesitated for some time between gratitude and convenience. In this irresolution he continued, until the English had entered his dominions, and advanced to Chateubourg, between Vitré and Rennes, where the earl of Buckingham received a solemn deputation of his nobility, who assured him their duke would meet him at Rennes; and excused his not having waited upon him sooner, by representing the ill humour of his subjects, with whom he was obliged to keep measures. This was actually the case; for, when the earl arrived at Rennes, he and a few of his attendants only were suffered to enter the place; nor did the duke as yet appear. He met him however at Mezieres, and frankly owned himself restricted by the malevolence and dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffection of his people, over whom he had no influence. He professed the deepest sense of obligation to the court of England, and vowed eternal at∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>achment to the interests of a country which had afforded him an asylum in his distress; but his authority was not established, his people were averse to the English, while his nobility him to send them home immediately, and compromise his difference with the crown of France. Mean while, as Nantes had openly decl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red against the English, the earl proposed to undertake the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ege of that important city, and the duke promised upon oath to supply him with provisions, and join him in a fortnight. The place was accordingly
<PB N="141" REF="1430"/>
invested; but, being strongly fortified and provided with a numerous garrison, the besiegers made but very little progress, and lay before it two whole months without being joined by the duke. He had indeed endeavoured to raise for∣ces for this purpose, but no body would repair to his standard; and the no∣bility gave him to understand, that if he should presume to join the enemies of his country, they would rise up in arms against him; whereas they would serve him with all their power in effecting an accommodation with France. He was obliged to submit to this proposal, and abandon the earl of Bucking∣ham, who seeing no prospect of reducing Nantes, and finding himself hampered for want of provisions, by the activity of the Bretons, who generally inter∣cepted his convoys, raised the siege during the Christmas holidays, and marched to Vannes, where by the duke's influence he was hospitably received, and pro∣vided with convenient quarters in that neighbourhood. Mean while a treaty was brought upon the carpet at Paris, for an accommodation between Mont∣fort and the king of France. This being concluded and ratified, the duke con∣sented to do homage to the French king, and was reinstated in his dutchy of Bretagne and county of Montfort. This agreement was in all probability<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1381.</NOTE> forwarded by a design of the duke of Buckingham to bring another army in the spring from England, as the treaty itself was managed without his know∣lege. Though incensed at the clandestine conduct of the duke, he did not think proper to manifest his resentment in any violent measures; but, being supplied with transports by the duke, embarked his army, and on the eleventh<NOTE PLACE="marg">P.

<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>While the earl o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Buckingham was employed in this fruitless expe∣dition, the Scots made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rruptions into the northern counties, which they ra∣vaged with fire and sword; and the earl of Northumberland, as warden of the Marches, began to assemble his forces to oppose the invaders; but, quar∣relling with the inhabitants of Hull and Newcastle, about a rich prize they had taken from the Scots at sea, they thwarted his measures in such a manner, that he could not collect a body of troops sufficient to engage the enemy: and he received orders from the ministry, commanding him to observe the truce with the utmost punctuality. The Scots were so far from acting with such a scrupulous regard to good faith, that they invaded Westmoreland and Cum∣berland, to the number of twenty thousand, commanded by earl Douglas, who surprized Penrith, wasted the country, and returned to Scotland with an immense booty; while the hands of the warden were tied up, by a fresh order to avoid hostilities, until matters could be amicably compromised. The duke of Lancaster is said to have been the author of these inglorious measures, that the king's arms might be more disengaged and at liberty to assist him in his scheme upon the crown of Castile. This conjecture seems to be confirmed by his subsequent conduct; for, when he himself marched to the north, at the head of a numerous army, towards the end of summer, instead of chas∣tising the enemy, he proposed conferences for a peace. These were opened accordingly, and a truce being concluded fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> three years, he disbanded hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces, and returned to the southern parts of the kingdom. While he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> absent upon this expedition, the parliament met at Northampton; and, hav∣ing deliberated upon the state of the nation, found that the debts incurred by the king, since the last subsidy, amounted to one hundred and sixty thousand

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The commons desired the prelates and lords to consider in what manner t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e nec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssary sum could be raised with the least inconvenience to the people; and<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after due deliberation, they proposed a taillage on every person, male and female, above the age of fifteen. This proposal was ap∣proved; and the parliament established a poll-tax of three groats upon every person of the realm, to be levied on each town by collectors appointed for that purpose. The more substantial people were enjoined to assist the poorer sort, according to the value of their estates; and the product of the tax was appro∣priated to the payment of arrears due to the army of the earl of Buckingham, the equipment of a fleet, and the defence of the kingdom.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>This imposition gave birth to those commotions which had like to have destroyed the English constitution. The copyholders and land-tenants in villenage, belonging to the church as well as to lay-lords, had become wealthy, and, for some time past, made divers efforts to recover that freedom to which they thought they had a natural title. They purchased exemplifi∣cations in the king's court, out of Doomsday-book, of the manors and towns to which they belonged, exempting them from all manner of servitude; and would not suffer distress to be taken, either by the servants of their lords, or the officers of justice: they engaged in associations to stand by one another, and even threatened their landlords <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith death and desolation. The commons had, in the first parliament of this reign, complained of these rebellious pro∣ceedings, by which their property was alienated, their manors were ruined, and the peace of the nation endangered: a statute was enacted, declaring those exemplifications of no validity, and ordering inquiry to be made after such associators and rebels, that they might be tried and brought to condign punishment. This law for some time suppressed their insolence; though the late taxes which fell chiefly upon the lower tenants served to nourish their dis∣contents: and these were fomented by seditious preachers, who asserted in their sermons, that by nature all men were equal; that servitude was an unjust oppression, contrary to the will of God; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at it was their duty to shake off the yoke, and maintain their birth-right. The minds of the vulgar were thus prepared for mischief, when the manner of collecting the poll-tax pro∣voked them to open revolt and insurrection. The king's necessities being so importunate, that he could not wait until the money should be collected, he farmed the tax to a set of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apacious persons, who committed numberless acts of oppression, which drove the people to despair; and the ministers of sedition did not fail to inflame their passions of indignation and revenge.</P>

<DIV4 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>The insurrection began in Essex, where a report was industriously spread, implying, that the copyholders and peasants were doomed to death; that their houses would be burned, and their farms plundered. The country peo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, alarmed at this intelligence, rose in their own defence, arming them∣selves with clubs, bows, swords, and halberds; and, assembling to the number of five thousand, sent deputies across the river into Kent, desiring the inhabitants of that county to join them in the common cause of liberty, that they might reform the state, and abolish taxes. This deputation was sent in consequence of an incident, which had already produced a tumult among the Kentishmen. One of the persons employed in collecting the poll-tax had entered into a dispute with a plebeian, known by the name of Wat Tyler,
<PB N="143" REF="1450"/>
who refused to pay for his daughter, on pretence of her being under the age mentioned in the act of parliament. The brutal collector insisted upon her being a full grown woman; and, in order to ascertain his conjecture, pro∣ceeded to acts of indecency, which provoked the father to such a degree, that he slew the tax-gatherer on the spot. His cause was immediately espoused by all the populace of the neighbourhood, who, encouraged by the example of their friends in Essex, took to their arms; and the spirit of mutiny spread like a contagion, through Sussex, Surry, Hertfordshire, and all the counties which formed the old kingdom of the East Angles. Not only the discon∣tented peasants, but all the debauched, profligate, and desperate villains, in these counties, took the field upon this occasion; and every separate multitude chose a leader of approved capacity. The people of condition neglected them at first, as mobs that would in a little time disperse of themselves; but they soon became too formidable to be quelled by the civil power. They pulled down the houses of the nobility and gentry, inflicted immediate death upon all the justices and practitioners of the law that fell into their hands: they burned all court-rolls and records; and obliged all persons to swear they would be true to king Richard, admit no king called John, and join with them in opposing taxes. At length Wat Tyler, at the head of the Kentish insurgents, joined those of Essex, commanded by Jack Straw; and, on the twel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th day of June advanced to Blackheath, to the number of an hundred thousand, with banners displayed. The king sending th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther messengers to know the reason of their insurrection, they gave him to understand, that they were come to speak with him about certain important affairs; and desired he would come and hear what they had to propose. Richard being advised to comply with their demand, actually crossed the Thames to give them that sa∣tisfaction; but, when they saw him approaching, they began to run towards the river, in order to intercept his retreat: so that Simon Sudbury archbishop of Canterbury, chancellor; and Sir Robert Hales, grand prior of the Knights hospitallers, treasurer of England, hurried him back to the Tower with all expedition. The rebels, disappointed of their prize, called aloud, Treason! treason! Then running towards the bridge, entered the city, where they plun∣dered several houses, and murdered some Flemish merchants. Next day, being joined by the populace of the city, they attacked the palace of the Savoy, belonging to the duke of Lancaster, which they burned and levelled to the ground, after having destroyed all the rich furniture, and broke in pieces vast quantities of plate and jewels. Thence they proceeded to the Temple, where they burned all the books, papers, and records; and, having demolished the buildings, repaired to the priory of St. John at Clerkenwell, which they treated in the same manner. These exploits being per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed, they divided themselves into three bodies; one of which took the route to Heybury, where they pillaged and reduced to ashes a magnificent house be∣longing to the knights of St. John; a second, consisting chiefly of the people of Essex and Hertfordshire, posted themselves on Mile-End-Green; the third took possession of St. Catharine's and Tower-Hill. Those who took up thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quarters at Mile-End, sent a message to the king, desiring to see him imme∣diately, otherwise they would pull down the Tower, and put him to death without mercy; and their companions on Tower-Hill intercepted the provi∣sions

They presented him with a paper of demands, and told him that he should be detained until they were granted under the great seal. These were, an exemption of all persons throughout the realm from bondage and servi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ude; free liberty of buying and selling in cities, boroughs, market∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owns, and all places whatsoever; the reduction of the rent of lands held in villenage to four pence an acre; and a general pardon for all offences. The king granted their request, on condition that they would return immediately to their own habitations, and leave two or three of each parish to receive the charters of freedom, which were immediately drawn up and sealed next morn∣ing. These being delivered, the peasants of Essex and Hertfordshire imme∣diately dispersed. Richard had no sooner quitted the Tower, than the body posted in the neighbouring avenues rushed in, without finding the least oppo∣sition: they forthwith beheaded the archbishop and Sir Robert Hales, mas∣sacred fifteen other persons in cold blood, and treated the king's mother with the utmost indignity; while the cowardly knights and their men at arms stood inactive, without daring to oppose such a brutal outrage.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The substantial citizens of London now began to recollect them∣selves from their consternation; and Walworth, who happened to be mayor, being seconded by the gallant Philpot, persuaded them to take arms in defence of their sovereign. Mean while the king <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent a message to Wat Tyler, offer∣ing him and his people the same charters which had satisfied the men of Essex; but this savage plebeian being fleshed in b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, and intoxicated with his power and success, had formed the design of murdering the king and all the nobles, and erecting a despotism on the ruins of the constitution: he therefore made no other reply to the king's messenger, but that he would consent to a peace, provided he liked the terms; and three successive charters were sent to him, and rej<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted, in the compass of a few hours. At length Richard, riding to∣wards Smithfield, invited him to a conference, that he might know and re∣move his objections; and he began to move towards that place with his fol∣lowers, but so slowly, that Sir John Newton, who delivered the message, to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him the king was waiting for him, and desired he would mend his pace. This pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d demagogue took umbrage at the freedom of his remon∣strance, and repli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d he might make what haste he would; but, for his own part, he would move as he himself should think proper. When he approached the king, he did not offer to alight; and, Sir John Newton blaming the in∣decency of his behaviour, he drew his dagger to stab him for his presumption. Newton dra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his weapon in his own defence, the king interposed, and or∣dered Sir John to d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liver up his dagger to Tyler, who, notwithstanding all his insolence and brutality, seemed disconcerted by the presence of his prince.
<PB N="145" REF="1470"/>
In all probability, his intention was to plunge the dagger into Richard's heart; he eyed his sovereign with a gloomy aspect; his hand began to shake, and his countenance denoted distraction. His demands were so extravagant, and made in such unconnected phrase, that Richard neither perfectly understood his meaning, nor would he give assent to his proposal. The intention of both was to amuse each other: for Tyler expected a reinforcement next day from Hertfordshire; and the king knew that Sir Robert Knolles was on his march, at the head of a thousand veterans, coming to his assistance. Nevertheless, the insolent plebeian could not brook a refusal; and, thinking perhaps this was a proper opportunity to strike the blow he had meditated, he lifted up the dagger, as if he intended to plunge it in the bosom of his sovereign; when Walworth, perceiving his drift, rode up and stunned him with a blow of his mace: Philpot finished his fate by thrusting his sword through the ruffian's body, so that he fell dead from his horse. His followers seeing him drop, ex∣claimed, "Our captain is slain; let us revenge his death:" and bent their bows for that purpose. But the king, though not quite sixteen years of age, rode up to them with admirable courage and presence of mind, saying, <Q>“What would you have, my lieges? Give yourselves no concern about the death of that traitor. I am your captain: follow me, and I will grant all your reasonable desires.”</Q> They were so confounded at the death of their leader, and the magnanimity of their prince, that they durst not venture to let fly their arrows, but followed him, as it were mechanically, into the fields of Islington. Before they could recollect themselves, Sir Robert Knolles ap∣peared with his band of veterans, and some thousands of Londoners, who took to their arms under Walworth, immediately after the death of Tyler. The sight of these troops completed the dejection of the insurgents; and the king offering them a general pardon, and the same kind of charter he had al∣ready granted to their companions, they fell down on their knees, and sub∣mitted. Sir Robert Knolles, and other officers that were about the king's person, proposed that some hundreds of them should be put to the sword in terrorem; but, as many persons had been compelled to join them, he would not suffer that example to be made, left the innocent should be con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded with the guilty; yet he ordered proclamation to be made, that none of them should be admitted within the walls of the city. Next day, however, they received their charter of infranchisement, and returned to their respective habitations.</P>

<HEAD>§ LIX.</HEAD>
<P>A fresh body of mutineers from Hertfordshire was in full march to join Tyler, when they received the news of his death, and the dispersion of their confederates. Nevertheless, they still kept together, and extorted letters of manumission from the monastery of St. Alban's, and other lords to whom they owed vassalage; some of whom they murdered. They likewise compelled the abbot and convent to deliver up all their charters and privileges, which they committed to the flames in the market-place. They even pleaded the royal authority for the outrages they committed, until the king published a proclamation, commanding all mayors, sheriffs, bailiffs, and other officers of the peace, to suppress these commotions. The rest of the kingdom was not free from the same kind of insurrections. The peasants of Suffolk, thinking they had as good a title to liberty as those of Kent and Essex, took to their

arms, and struck off the head of Sir John Cavendish, lord chief justice of Eng∣land: they likewise murdered two monks belonging to the convent of St. Ed∣mundsbury, which they robbed of all its charters; while those of Norfolk rose under the conduct of one known by the name of John Littester, or the Dyer, who affected great state, and compelled all the freeholders of the county to countenance his proceedings. He ordered his followers to beat out the brains of Sir Robert Sale, who had presumed to censure his conduct; and obliged Sir William Morley and Sir John Brewes, to set out for the court, in order to in∣troduce three of his followers as deputies to his majesty. These had instructions to sollicit an ample charter of liberties, and to present the king with a large sum of money, which they had extorted from the city of Norwich. In their jour∣ney to London they were met by Henry Spenser, the warlike bishop of Nor∣wich, who, being informed of their errand, ordered them to be beheaded with∣out ceremony.

<P>Notwithstanding these repeated overthrows and executions, the in∣surgents of Essex had the presumption to send deputies to the king for a con∣firmation of their charter: but by this time Richard was in a condition to treat with them as they deserved. Immediately after the dispersion of Tyler's ad∣herents he had assembled his military tenants, and summoned his faithful sub∣jects to take arms for the security of his person; and in three days he mus∣tered forty thousand men on Blackheath. On the thirtieth day of June he published a proclamation, requiring all tenants to do their accustomed services; and sending a detachment of troops into the heart of Kent, to maintain the peace of that county, marched in person against the rebels of Essex, who being defeated in two successive engagements at Billerecay and Sudbury, sub∣mitted<NOTE PLACE="marg">W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>singham.

<P>Richard having totally quelled all the insu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rections, during which above seven thousand persons had lost their lives, in different parts of the country, he granted commissions for trying the ringleaders of those rebellious peasants; and among the rest, one John B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, a fanatic priest, who acted as principal incendiary, and even from the first manifestation of their discontent, spirited them up to mischief and revolt, by inflammatory sermons and circular letters, couched in quaint mysterious rhymes, admirably calculated to work up the minds of ignorant rustics to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury and enthusiasm. When they first assem∣bled at Blackheath, he exhorted them in a sermon to be stout in asserting their
<PB N="147" REF="1490"/>
liberty, which could not be secured without killing all the great men of the kingdom, the lawyers, justices, and jurymen; and then there would be equal freedom, rank, and power, among all persons. This wretched fanatic, to∣gether with Jack Straw, and the other chieftains that were taken, being tried and convicted of treason, owned before execution, that when they insisted upon the king's coming to them at Blackheath, their design was to have slain all his attendants, and carried himself in person round the kingdom, as a sanction to their proceedings, until they should have been joined by the people in all the different counties: then they would have suddenly massacred all the nobility and knights, who either by their advice or personal valour were capable of op∣posing their progress; and lastly, they would have sacrificed the king, the bi∣shops, and all the clergy, except the mendicant sriars, who should have been allowed a comfortable subsistence, for confessing and celebrating divine service throughout the kingdom. After having destroyed the form of religion and government, they proposed to enact new laws, create Wat Tyler king of Kent, and set up a monarch for every county. As for that pretender to the throne of Kent, he had determined to burn and plunder the city of London, and divide the spoil among his followers, when his execrable purpose was pre∣vented by the spirit of Walworth and Philpot, who, together with alderman Brembre and Laud, were knighted and recompenced with lands for the ser∣vices they had performed in extinguishing this dangerous rebellion.</P>

<P>During these commotions the duke of Lancaster was in the north, managing the treaty with the Scots, who, in consideration thereof, had forbore taking advantage of the troubles in the kingdom of England. While this ne∣gotiation was on the carpet, a quarrel had happened between the duke and the earl of Northumberland, which last had refused the other admittance into Ber∣wick; and now both came, with their followers in arms, to the parliament, which was summoned to meet on the sixteenth day of September, to take mea∣sures for quieting the minds of the people, which were still in agitation: the session, however, was prorogued to the fourth day of November; and in the mean time, the difference between those two great noblemen was compro∣mised. The members of both houses being convened, the king gave them to understand, that he had been obliged to grant letters of freedom and manu∣mission to the peasants, in order to avoid mischief; and that he had since re∣voked them by the advice of his council, as charters extorted by compulsion, contrary to reason, law, justice, and the rights and privileges of the prelates, lords, and freeholders of the realm: he desired, however, to know their sen∣timents on the subject, according to which they should either be repealed or confirmed. The lords and commons unanimously resolved, that such charters obtained by violence, were contrary to law, injurious to the nobility, and de∣structive to the kingdom; for which reasons they were declared null and void, and repealed by authority of parliament. Then the commons proceeded to an enquiry about the causes of the late commotion, and having deliberated upon the subject, imputed it chiefly to the oppression exercised over the peasants, by the king's officers and the courts of law, which encouraged suits and quarrels in the country. The king appointed a committee of prelates and lords to in∣spect the conduct of such officers, that the grievance might be redressed: all persons whose writings and vouchers had been burned by the insurgents, were
<PB N="148" REF="1500"/>
invited to come and produce proof before the king's council, that they might receive exemplifications, without trouble or expence. The next object of their consideration was the necessity of publishing pardons for those lords and gen∣tlemen who, in opposing the rebels, had committed illegal actions, as well as for the towns, boroughs, and country people, who had been concerned in the insurrection. From this last act of amnesty the ringleaders of the insurgents were nominally excepted, together with the town of St. Edmundsbury, the in∣habitants of which were concerned in the murder of the chancellor, treasurer, and chief justice; and those of Cambridge, who had plundered Bennet-Col∣lege, carried away all the charters of the university, extorted bonds from the masters and scholars, and committed divers other enormities, by the conni∣vance of the magistrates. Their franchises were therefore forfeited, some of their privileges granted to the university, and the rest restored to the town, upon the submission of the inhabitants. These clauses being settled, the com∣mons eagerly desired they might be passed into a law; observing at the same time, that, considering the ill humour of the people, they could not venture to grant any sort of talliage. But the king refused to comply with their re∣quest, until they should have made some provision for the necessities of the state; then they voted a subsidy on wool and leather, and the pardons passing the great seal, the parliament was adjourned to the twenty-fourth day of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>Two successive treaties had been brought upon the carpet for the marriage of Richard, first with Catherine, daughter of Barnaby Visconti duke of Milan, and afterwards with Catherine, daughter of the late emperor Lewis; but both these proving abortive, a match was at length concluded between him and Anne, sister of the emperor Winceslaus king of Bohemia; a lady whose high rank seems to have been considered as a sufficient compensation for her want of fortune; for, instead of bringing a portion suitable to her quality, her brother Winceslaus stipulated for a loan of eighteen thousand marks, one moiety of which was to be remitted upon the delivery of the princess at Calais. She arrived in England a few days before Christmas; and after the holidays the nuptials were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olemnized: then she was crowned with great pomp in Westmin∣ster-Abbey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.

It was in this session the duke of Lancaster proposed that he should transport a body of forces to the assistance of the king of Portugal, who was hard pressed by the king of Castile. As the Portuguese monarch was a very useful ally to England, the earl of Cambridge had been sent in the preceding year, with a small body of forces to succour him in his distress; and by their valour, they had actually raised the siege of Lis∣bon, which the Spaniards had undertaken: but they were not numerous enough to act offensively; and the duke of Lancaster, who never lost sight of his claim upon Castile, attempted to borrow of the parliament sixty thousand pounds, for raising a sufficient number of forces to drive the Spaniards out of Portugal, promising to repay the money in three years, either in specie or by some service that should be acceptable to the nation. The proposal was de∣bated in both houses; but the commons were so far from complying with his request, that, when they granted the subsidy for the defence of the realm, they

expresly declared, they would not involve themselves in a quarrel with Spain on any pretence whatsoever.</P>

<P>During these transactions in England, France was exposed to all the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1382.</NOTE> inconveniencies of a minority. Lewis duke of Anjou, eldest uncle to the young king Charles VI. burthened the people with such grievous taxes, as pro∣duced insurrections in Paris, Rouen, and other populous cities: his brothers the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, who were associated with him in the admi∣nistration, refused to concur in his measures; and great disorder arose from their dissensions. These circumstances being considered, this was judged a fa∣vourable conjuncture for invading France with such an armament as might in∣timidate her into a peace, which would be very acceptable to the English, who suffered greatly in their trade by the French depredations. A council being held at Windsor, the lords were unanimously of opinion, that the king should invade France with a royal army; and they offered to serve under him with a certain number of men at arms and archers. The merchants of London and other trading towns, being pressed to advance money for this service, declined running any risk without the security of parliament, which was therefore called on the seventeenth day of May, to remove their scruples, and make provision for the government of the realm during the king's absence. Even then a com∣mittee of merchants appointed to consider of ways and means to raise the neces∣sary sum, which would amount to sixty thousand pounds, proposed that the lords spiritual and temporal, together with the knights of the shires, should lend a consi∣derable sum for the necessity of the government, without interest; and they would express their loyalty in the same manner, upon proper security, without which they declared they would not lend one farthing. The parliament, disappointed in this quarter, enacted ordinances, permitting foreigners to buy and sell their merchandize all over England, by virtue of the king's licence; and permitting aliens as well as natives, to export wool for a certain term, on paying the duties at Calais, and remitting part of the subsidy on wool and leather, to such as should make prompt payment within a limited time. These regulations not answering the purpose, the scheme of the expedition was laid aside; but the merchants of the West, offering to maintain a fleet for the safe-guard of the coast, their proposal was accepted, and a tax laid upon wine and merchandize for that service.</P>

<P>When the parliament broke up, conferences were opened for a peace between England and France, and the negotiation succeeded so far that both parties agreed to a short cessation of arms: but a final treaty was in a great measure prevented by a schism in the church, by which all Europe was divided. When pope Gregory X. died at Rome, the inhabitants of that city resolved that no person should succeed him in the papal chair, but one who would reside in Italy. This resolution was signified to the college of cardinals, who were generally natives of France; and these, in a formal instrument, pro∣tested against the validity of the election, in case any violence should be offered to the conclave. The Romans became so furious on the day of election, that the cardinals dur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not venture to oppose their will; and the archbishop of Bari being chosen, assumed the name of Urban VI. The French cardinals were no sooner at liberty, than they retired to the kingdom of Naples, and dis∣claiming the election as extorted by violence, proceeded to a new choice,
<PB N="150" REF="1520"/>
which fell upon the cardinal of Geneva, who took the name of Clement VII. Urban, who was naturally sour, proud, and inflexible, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng alarmed at this opposition in the person of an accomplished rival, supported by such a powerful nation as France, laid aside his haughty deportment, and endeavoured to in∣grati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te himself with the potentates of Europe. He created nine and twenty cardi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als in one day, and elevated to that dignity Philip <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Alençon, a prince of the blood in France: he confirmed the election of Winceslaus to the imperial th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e; and that prince espousing his cause, engaged the court of England in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me interest: their example was followed by the northern potentates, while Clement was supported by the kings of France, Castile, Scotland, and Cyprus, the counts o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Savoy and Geneva, which last was his brother, the duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Austria, and some other German princes. All Italy was involved in war; the enterprising Jane queen of Naples declared against Urban, and fur∣nished his rival with forces; the emperor sent a body of troops to the assistance of Urban: two battles ensued, in the first of which Clement obtained the vic∣tory, but in the last he was vanquished, and flying to France took up his resi∣dence at Avignon. The court of France prevailed upon him to preach up a crusade against Richard king of England and his subjects; while his competi∣tor excommunicated him as an antipope, and sent over a commission to the warlike bishop of Norwich, to command a crusade against him and all his ad∣herents. He at the same time vested this prelate with a plenary power as legate, to grant dispensations to clergymen who should serve in person, excusing them from attending their cures; and to bestow such indulgences and absolution as were granted to those who had engaged in crusades against the infidels. The people inlisted in this expedition with incredible ardour; and all ranks of both sexes contributed largely towards the expence, by parting with their money, plate, jewels, and furniture, even before the bishop was empowered by the king to put the pope's scheme in execution. It was, however, determined in council, that an effort should be made against France; and a parliament was convoked on the sixth day of October, in hope of obtaining a supply for that purpose. The bishop of Hereford, having explained the cause of their meet∣ing, mentioned two ways of annoying the enemy, either by joining the Flem∣ings, who had broke with France, and sollicited the assistance of the English, or accepting the proposal of the duke of Lancaster, who offered to make a di∣version in Spain with a certain number of forces, provided they would supply him with three and forty thousand pounds, which he engaged to refund in money or service. The commons rejected this proposal of the duke, whom they hated for the haughtiness of his manners, and whose designs they sus∣pected of disloyalty, and resolved to encourage and support the bishop of Nor∣wich in his crus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, as he proposed to transport his troops to Calais, and march to the succour of the Flemings, who were the antient and most useful allies of the English. They therefore petitioned the throne that the Marches of Calais might be granted for a certain term to that prelate, with a considerable sum of money, out of the large subsidy they had just voted for the defence of the kingdom, that he might be enabled to assemble his troops and cross the<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.

<P>The session breaking up, the members had scarce retired to their own homes, when advice was brought that the French had routed the Flemings
<PB N="151" REF="1530"/>
with great slaughter in two successive battles; and reduced all the great towns in Flanders, except Ghent, the siege of which they had actually undertaken. A council was immediately convened at Westminster, where it was resolved that the king should set out in person for the relief of that city; and a parliament was summoned to meet in February, that they might deliberate upon this reso∣lution, which was explained to them, at the opening of the session, by the bi∣shop of London, high chancellor of the realm. The commons having con∣sulted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1383.</NOTE> with a committee of the other house, on the subject of his majesty's voyage, gave it as their opinion, that the truce with the Scots being almost ex∣pired, and that nation actually employed in making preparations to renew their hostilities, neither the king himself, nor any one of his three uncles, could be spared out of the realm, until the peace of the borders should be secured. They therefore recommended to his majesty's acceptance, the scheme of the bishop of Norwich, who offered to raise a considerable army for the relief of Ghent and reduction of Flanders; and afterwards to carry the war into France, on con∣dition of his receiving the subsidies which had been granted in the last parlia∣ment. By this time the bishop, having more maturely considered the nature of the expedition, altered his first proposal, and engaged to serve the king one year with five and twenty hundred men at arms, and the like number of archers well mounted and accoutred, for the whole fifteenth granted by the laity; that two thousand of that number, should be ready to embark within twenty days after the first payme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; and that he would defray the charge of shipping and all other expences. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>This proposal being chearfully embraced by Richard, the bishop began to assemble his troops, and was joined by a great number of voluntiers and enthusiasts, who embarked in the expedition from religious motives. With these he crossed the sea in May to Calais, where he proposed to remain until he should be reinforced by William de Beauchamp, whom the king had appoint∣ed his lieutenant: but he being detained in England by the dilatory proceed∣ings of Lancaster, who endeavoured to thwart the bishop for having interfered with his design, the crusards became so impatient and mutinous, that their leader took the field, and at<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acking Gravelines, reduced it by a desperate as∣sault. The inhabitants and garrison of Dunkirk, intimidated by this exploit, opened their gates to the victor; while the count of Flanders, who was intirely under French influence, prepared to give him battle. The bishop, who was by this time joined by the gallant Sir Hugh de Calverly, marched out to meet him with great confidence, though his army amounted to thirty thousand men. An engagement ensuing, the count was totally routed, and Cassel, Dixmuyde. Bourburg, Newport, and Popperen, surrendered to the victorious English. The king of France, alarmed at the progress of the bishop, assembled an army of one hundred thousand men, to chastise his presumption; and in the mean time the English were joined by a vast number of fresh crusards from Eng∣land, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sands of whom consisted of the very dregs of the people, and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li∣gate miscreants allured by the hope of plunder. These were transported, at the expence of Sir John Philpot, and became such an incumbrance to the army, that the bishop desired he would check his zeal, and send no such naked ruf∣fians for the future. The prelate's forces being now increased to ninety thou∣sand, he resolved to hazard a pitched battle with the French king; but there
<PB N="152" REF="1540"/>
was a set of mutineers in his army, who publicly declared that they would not march into France, until they should have taken Yypres, where they expected immense plunder: so that he was obliged to und<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtake the siege of that place, contrary to his own judgment. He gave several furious assauits, but was al∣ways repulsed by the French garrison; and these repeated miscarriages dis∣piriting the troops, that fought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the impulse of enthusiasm or the spirit of depredation, which cannot brook much fatigue or opposition, they rejected all discipline and restraint, ravaged the adjacent country, and deserted in such numbers, that their leader found it absolutely necessary to abandon his enter∣prize at the approach of the French army, and retire to Dunkirk with some precipitation, leaving all his artillery and ammunition as a prey to the enemy. Sir Hugh de Calverly and Sir Thomas Trivet threw themselves into Bourburg, which was immediately invested by Charles, who summoned them to surrender on pain of being put to the sword without mercy. Far from being intimidated by this menace they stood two desperate assaults, in which the aggressors were repulsed with great slaughter; and then obtained an honourable capitulation, by virtue of which they retired to Calais. The French king, marching to Gravelines, found the bishop so resolutely determined to make a vigorous de∣fence, that they offered to conduct him and his forces to any place he should name, and pay fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teen thousand marks as a consideration for the provisions, and liberty to demolish the fortifications. The bishop, finding the courage of his crusards considerably cooled, demanded a truce for a certain number of days, at the expiration of which he promised to give a definitive answer; and, this being granted, he sent a messenger with a letter to the king, pressing him to send a reinforcement to his relief. Richard was by this time immersed in all the riot and debauchery of unthinking youth; he had been debarred the ad∣vantage of a proper education, and he had not natural sagacity to supply this defect. He indulged his passions to excess; and was giddy, volatile, and voluptuous, without that good sense and discernment which often shine thro' the mists of irregularity and intemperance, and promise an agreeable after-day of reason and reflection. He was surrounded with pernicious sycophants, and his brain heated with riot and revelling at Daintry in Northamptonshire, when he received the bishop's letter, which he had no sooner perused than he called for his horse, and posted singly to London, breathing destruction to France and personal defiance to Charles. At his arrival, he sent for the duke of Lan∣caster, and appointed him commander in chief of an army designed for the bishop's relief; but, before the troops could be assembled and embarked, the truce expiring, the bishop was obliged to embrace the terms proposed; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froiffart.

<P>The bad success of this expedition concurred with other circum∣stances to dispirit and disgust the nation. The Scots had made an irruption into England, and demolished the castle of Werk: and when the duke of Lancaster proposed an interview with the prince of Scotland, the request was granted; but, instead of agreeing to a peace with England, they concluded a treaty of alliance with the French king, who obliged himself to send a strong body of forces into Scotland, together with a certain number of arms, and forty thousand franks of gold, to be employed in the prosecution of a war
<PB N="153" REF="1550"/>
with England. The marechal de Sancerre had expelled the English intirely from the Limousin, and even reduced many of their forts in Poitou; the Norman privateers had taken a large fleet of ships belonging to English merchants; and several ships of war had been obliged to surrender to the Castilian navy on the coast of Rochelle. All these disasters combined did not discourage the people so much as the inconsiderate and extravagant conduct of the king, who gave himself up wholly to a set of worthless flatterers, who seduced him to his ruin and plunged him in all manner of excess. His uncle the duke of Lancaster chose to live at a distance from court, on various pretences, rather than mingle with the herd of low parasites that surrounded his nephew; and the bishop of London resigned the great seal, which was delivered to Sir Michael de la Pole, the son of a rich merchant in Kingston upon Hull, who rendered himself famous in the sequel. This man, succeeding to his father's wealth, supplied the king with money at exorbitant usury; and being of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unning pliable disposition, soon insinuated himself into the confidence and affection of Richard, by exerting all his industry in gratifying the passions and appetites of his prince. While the king squandered away his revenue upon his favourites and pleasures, the queen acted with the same profusion towards her needy and rapacious countrymen; so that their finances were soon ex∣hausted; and their necessities, together with the situation of public affairs, required the assistance and advice of a parliament, which was assembled at West∣minster on the first day of November. The new chancellor opened the session with a detail of the public affairs; and observed that as the war had descended to the king with his crown, the parliament was obliged in honour to sup∣port it effectually. He told them delays were dangerous; that it was the king's pleasure they should postpone all other business, till that of the ne∣cessary supplies should be adjusted; and that no member should depart from the parliament without special leave from his majesty. The lords and com∣mons, in obedience to this address, took the necessities of the war into con∣sideration, and voted two half fifteenths, on condition the clergy would make a grant in the usual proportion; then they proceeded to deliberate upon the causes of the late miscarriage in Flanders, which the chancellor imputed to the bishop of Norwich, whom he therefore impeached for non-performance of his engagements with the king. The articles of his charge imported, that he had received eighteen thousand franks of gold from the enemy; that he had not engaged the best officers that were to be found, or a king's lieutenant to discipline his troops; and that he had not served half the time stipulated in his contract, nor mustered his forces at Calais, according to the nature of his obligation. The bishop easily acquitted himself of the first article, and made such excuses for the subsequent part of his conduct as plainly proved that he had acted with spirit and capacity; but, as he owned that some of his followers had misbehaved, and that he had not served the full time mentioned in his con∣tract, he was adjudged to make fine and ransom at the king's pleasure; and the temporalities of his bishopric were seized for that purpose. The resent∣ment of the parliament fell next upon the ringleaders of the mutiny, to which all the disasters of the campaign had certainly owed their origin. Sir Thomas Trivet, Sir Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Ferrers, Sir William Ellingham, and Sir William Har∣rendon, were accused of having received twenty thousand franks of gold from the French for the surrender of different places.

<P>This campaign of the bishop, though unfortunate for himself, was yet of some service to his country.

<P>The Scots having committed ravages on the borders, the duke of Lancaster at his return to England was sent with the earl of Buckingham, at the head of a numerous army, to chastise that people whom no treaties could restrain: but the duke did not engage very warmly in this expedition. He had always endeavoured to promote a good understanding between the two kingdoms, either because he thought that a peace with Scotland would have enabled Richard to assist him the more effectually in his designs upon Castile, or believed that the French would have been easily humbled, could the Scots have been detached from their alliance; or lastly, because he had a regard or affection for the nation in which he had been so hospitably received during the troubles of his own country. Whatever his motives might have been for favouring the Scots at this juncture; certain it is he loitered away his time in Northumberland, until they had removed all their valuable effects beyond the friths: so that, when he entered Scotland about Easter, he could find nei∣ther booty nor subsistence. Having advanced as far as Edinburgh, which was deserted, he set the empty houses on fire, and returned to England, after hav∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingham.</NOTE> lost abundance of men and horses, which died of cold and famine. The enemy, following him close at his heels, entered England, where they burned and plundered towns and villages, and ravaged the open country; and the English made reprisals in Scotland, until they thought proper to claim the benefit of the truce, to which both agreed on the seventh day of July. When the duke of Lancaster returned from this inglorious expedition, he found the popular odium increased against him to a dangerous degree of in∣veteracy: every mouth was opened in condemnation of his conduct; the people clamoured against his insolence and ambition, and did not scruple to accuse him of having betrayed the interests of his country. While Richard kept his court at Salisbury, during the Easter holidays, an Irish carmelite friar presented him with a paper, containing a circumstantial detail of a conspiracy
<PB N="155" REF="1570"/>
hatched by the duke of Lancaster against his majesty's life; and swore by the sacrament of Christ's body, which he had that day administered, that every word of the accusation was true. Richard, startled at this intelligence, had recourse to the advice of two clerks belonging to his own chapel; and while the three were employed in a consultation upon this important subject, the duke chanced to enter the apartment. The king could not disguise his senti∣ments so much, but that his uncle perceived his resentment and perturbation, and immediately withdrew. Then the timorous clerks, dreading the power of Lancaster, counselled Richard to send for him, and put the paper in his hand. The duke accordingly returned, in consequence of the message; and having perused the information, without betraying the least symptom of guilt or con∣fusion, denied every article of the charge, and offered to purge himself by single combat. Though the king seemed perfectly convinced of his innocence, he demanded that the friar should be apprehended and brought to his trial, and in the mean time secured in the custody of Sir John Holland the king's uterine brother. Richard complied with his request; and on the morning of the day fixed for his trial, the carmelite was found murdered in a barbarous manner. This suspicious circumstance renewed the king's jealousy, in which he was con∣firmed by the clergy of his houshold and Tresilian his chief justiciary, who proposed that the duke should be arrested, and undertook to proceed against him as a common traitor. This advice being reported to the earl of Buckingham, who, though a nobleman of good principles, was violent in his affections and passionate even to a degree of frensy, he forthwith rushed into the king's cham∣ber; and drawing his sword, swore he would sacrifice all those who should presume to accuse his brother of treason. This address intimidated the king and his attendants to such a degree, that they durst not speak their sentiments or attempt to take any vigorous measures against the duke, who retired im∣mediately to his castle of Pontefract, where he knew himself secure from the machinations of his enemies. Though the council did not think proper to pro∣secute<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tyrrel.</NOTE> this nobleman, they resolved to apprehend the lord Zouch, who was mentioned as his accomplice in the friar's information. The gout had con∣fined him to his bed, but he was conveyed to town in a litter, and brought to his trial, when he pleaded his own cause so successfully that he was ac∣quitted by his peers, who seemed to impute the whole information to the male∣volence of the clergy, who were known to be his professed enemies. The lord Zouch's acquittal in all probability, removed the king's suspicion of his uncle; for he began to listen to the suggestions of his mother the princess of Wales, who laboured to promote a reconciliation between him and the duke, and at length succeeded in her endeavours. Immediately after this accommodation, the duke and his brother the earl of Buckingham were appointed plenipoten∣tiaries to treat of a pacification with the French king, who had named his un∣cles the dukes of Berry and Burgundy to manage his interests in the congress which was held in Picardy. The two brothers crossed the sea on this negotia∣tion, with a very splendid retinue; but the conferences produced nothing but a truce till the following May, in which the Scots were comprehended, as well as the duke of Lancaster himself, in the character of the king of Castile. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Before the duke of Lancaster returned from the Scottish expedi∣tion, he, as warden of the Marches, contracted with the earl of Northumber∣land, who, for a certain consideration, engaged to keep the field from the first day of May, till the eleventh day of June, and have a watchful eye over the town of Berwick and the castle of Carlile. He acted as lord lieutenant of the counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, deputy war∣den of the Marches, and admiral of the north coast. The agreement between him and Lancaster was confirmed by the king at New Sarum; and it was supposed, that he undertook to be answerable for every thing that should hap∣pen within the limits of his command: notwithstanding all his vigilance, the Scots, in the course of this summer, found means to bribe the deputy-governor of Berwick, who betrayed the castle into their hands. The duke returning from Picardy, and being informed of the event, resolved to effect the ruin of Northumberland, to whom he had never been heartily reconciled since their first quarrel. He impeached him for the loss of Berwick, in the parliament which assembled on the twelfth day of November; and as he did not appear when summoned, he was condemned and forfeited for high treason. The earl was unwilling to appear until he should have made amends for his neglect, or rather for his error, in trusting such an important charge to a traitor: he assem∣bled sixteen thousand men, with which he ravaged the southern parts of Scot∣land, when the tidings of the truce put an end to his hostilities: nevertheless he thought himself at liberty to recover Berwick, which had been taken during a cessation of arms, and invested it accordingly. Having planted his artillery, he gave the garrison to understand, that he would put them all to the sword should they make the least resistance; whereas they should have a gratification of two thousand marks, and be allowed to march out with all the honours of war, if they would surrender the fortress immediately. The governor com∣plied with the proposal; and the earl of Northumberland having thus retrieved his honour, and vindicated his character from all suspicion, the sentence which had passed agai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st him was repealed, though he never could forgive the duke of Lancaster, for having taken such a base advantage of his absence and mis∣fortune.</P>

What induced the commons to vote so large a supply, was the intelligence they received of mighty preparations making by

the French king for invading England by sea, while Robert king of Scotland should make an irruption with a numerous army into the northern counties. Though the duke of Burgundy had succeeded to the vast estate of the count of Flanders, the citizens of Ghent refused to lay down their arms, and sollicitted the assistance and protection of Richard, who sent over Sir John Bourchier to act as his lieutenant; and under the conduct of that brave officer they ob∣tained several advantages over the French, which obliged them to postpone their design of invading England. This scheme had been projected by the duke of Burgundy; and a numerous fleet was assembled at Sluys for the trans∣portation of the forces, under the direction of John de Vienne admiral of France, who actually conveyed to Scotland five hundred men at arms, and a very considerable sum of money, as a present to the Scottish monarch. The<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> French army intended for the descent had already marched down to Sluys, and was ready to embark under the command of the constable, the marechal San∣cerre, and the lord of Cousy, when the strong town of Damme declared for the inhabitants of Ghent, and admitted a garrison to defend it against the duke of Burgundy. At the same time the people of Sluys conspired with them to set on fire the French fleet that lay in their harbour. This scheme being dis∣covered to the duke, he postponed the expedition to England, and resolved to chastise the Flemings for their rebellion: Damme was taken by storm, and all the garrison put to the sword; and the French troops marched from thence into the heart of the country: so that England had nothing to fear for that season. Mean while John de Vienne pressed the king of Scotland to assemble his army and invade England; but that prince refused to take the field, until he should be certainly informed of the French army's being landed on the sou∣thern parts of the island: nevertheless, he furnished him with a small body of forces, at the head of which he made a furious irruption into Northumberland, and took several places of consequence. By this time Richard had resolved to march against them in person, and appointed the rendezvous of his forces at Newcastle upon Tyne, where a greater number of knights than had ever been known to serve on such an occasion, assembled to share the glory of his first campaign. At the same time a fleet of ships, commanded by the lord Thomas Percy, was ordered to attend the motions of the army, in order to supply it with provision, in case they should find no subsistence in Scotland. John duke of Lancaster was detached with the van of the army, to intercept the Scots in their return from England, which they had ravaged to the gates of York; but they outmarched his forces, and carried intelligence of the king's motions to Robert, who was not a little chagrined to find himself exposed to the whole power of England, through the failure of the invasion.</P>

Before Richard entered Scotland, the enemy h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d retired as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sual with their cattle and effects, beyond the frith of Forth; so that he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w not a living creature, and must have starved in a de∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t country, had not his f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet supplied him with prov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ons. He advanced as fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as Edinburgh, which had for some time been abandoned; and there the duke of Lancaster advised him to proceed northward, in imitation of his grand∣father and the first Edwardm who had penetrated to the extremities of the island. But he was surrounded by sycophants, who dreaded the protraction of the cam∣paign, in the course of which the duke might supersede their influence; and there∣fore they opposed his advice, on pretence of its being calculated for confirming his interest in the army. In a word, they alarmed this weak prince with such in∣finuations concerning the ambitious designs of the duke of Lancaster, as con∣vinced him of that nobleman's being a traitor; and as he had not courage enough to manifest his sentiments in a princely manner, they broke out in sud∣den starts of passion, which he wanted prudence to restrain. When the duke repeated his instances to pass the Forth, Richard said, with marks of great per∣turbation, "I and my army will never go farther north, you and yours may." The duke answered, "I have no will of my own, but am an obedient subject." "That you are not," exclaimed the king, and then quitted the apartment abruptly. It required some address in the duke, to maintain his footing in such a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lippery situation; and he prudently chose to efface the king's suspicions by obsequious behaviour, and a constant attention to the duties of his office. By this time, the fleet being detained by contrary winds, they began to be in great want of provision and forage, by which both men and horse suffered exceedingly: they had no opportunity of acting effectually against the Scots, who avoided a general engagement, and distressed them intercepting their convoys from Berwick, and cutting off their detached parties. A strong body of them assembling in the West under the earls of Douglas, Marche, and Fife, entered Cumberland, burned Penrith, demolished the castles of Werk, Ford, and Cornwal, ravaged the country as far as Newcastle, and even insulted the garrison of Carlile with impunity. The king, being informed of these trans∣actions, resolved to return to his own dominions, according to the advice of his three favourites, Michael de la Pole, Tresilian, and Robert Vere earl of Oxford; and after having burned the huts of which Edinburgh was composed, and all the churches of tolerable architecture, the army began its march in August for Berwick, after an inglorious campaign, during which the Scots amply indemnified themselves for the losses they had sustained, with an im∣mense booty which they found in England. Richard no sooner retired, than, in conjunction with the French auxiliaries, they invested the strong fortress of Roxburgh, which in all probability would have fallen into their hands, had not Robert been so disguisted with his French friends, that he would not longer act in concert with John de Vienne, who had debauched a lady of quality at his court, and insisted upon Roxburgh's being garrisoned by the French troops, in case it should be taken by their joint endeavours. The king of Scotland, in∣censed at the insolence of this foreigner, and the duke of Burgundy's failure in the performance of his contract, raised the siege, and abstained from all<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chman.</NOTE> hostilities during the winter.</P>

<P>When the king returned to Westminster he summoned a parlia∣ment to meet on the twentieth day of October; and in the mean time, am∣bassadors arrived from the king of Portugal, offering in their master's name to recognize the duke of Lancaster as king of Castile, provided he would join them with a reinforcement of English troops; and to give up in his favour all the conquests that should be made in that kingdom. The prince who at this time sat upon the Portuguese throne was a natural brother of the late king Ferdinand, whom the subjects had invested with the royal authority, in oppo∣sition to the king of Castile, who claimed the crown of Portugal, by virtue of his wife, the only legitimate child of the deceased monarch. He had for∣merly invaded the kingdom, from which he had been driven by the help of a body of English auxiliaries, who had not only raised the siege of Lisbon, but in a great measure contributed to the victory which Ferdinand obtained over the Castilians at Aljubarata. The king of Castile, notwithstanding this over∣throw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1386.</NOTE> began to reassemble fresh forces to renew his invasion; and Ferdinand being informed of his preparations, proposed this treaty to John duke of Lan∣caster, who was glad of every opportunity to assert his pretensions to Castile. Richard, who was too volatile to retain resentment, agreed to assist his uncle in this expedition the more willingly, as it would remove a troublesome in∣spector of his conduct, whose ambition would be employed in external objects. His project seems to have been equally agreeable to the parliament, which granted a large subsidy for the voyage of John king of Castile and Leon, the security of the coast, and the safety of the Scottish Marches. The commons thinking they had a right to some condescension from the crown, in return for this large supply, petitioned that the oeconomy of the king's houshold might be inspected by the chancellor, treasurer, and keeper of the privy seal; and that the antient statutes concerning the houshold might be observed. They likewise demanded a list of the ministry for the ensuing year; but Ri∣chard evaded the first by an equivocal answer, and peremptorily refused to comply with the other demand. Far from giving them the least hope of re∣trenching his expences, he proceeded to new acts of extravagance and profu∣sion. The earl of Buckingham was created duke of Gloucester, and the earl of Cambridge promoted to the dukedom of York; and each received a grant of a thousand pounds a year to support his new dignity. Michael de la<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> Pole was created earl of Suffolk, and gratified with a considerable pension, and Robert Vere earl of Oxford dignified with the title of Marquis of Dublin, to which was annexed a grant of all the revenues of Ireland, farmed for five thousand marks a year. Leo, who had been expelled from his kingdom of Armenia, arriving in England, on pretence of negotiating a peace between the crowns of France and England, met with a magnificent reception from Ri∣chard, who not only favoured him with a large appointment for his subsist∣ence while he resided in England, but likewise granted him a pension of a thousand pounds for life. These instances of extravagance, together with his ineffectual conference for a peace with the Scots and other enemies of the na∣tion, increased the clamours of the people, and rendered him an object of con∣tempt with his own subjects.</P>

This answer satisfied the duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Berry, and John actually wrote an account of his proposal to Richard; but in the mean time the news of this intended match reaching the court of Castile, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e king of that country with alarm: he foresaw that such an alliance would naturally be attended with a peace between France and England; in wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, both powers would unite in prosecuting the claim of Catherine to the crown of Castile. In this apprehension, he dispatched ambassadors to the duke of Lancaster at Bayonne, with proposals of a marriage between Catherine and his son and heir Henry. The duke saw immediately the advantage of such a coalition, by which his posterity would be secured on the throne of Castile; and made no scruple of giving the preference to this proposal over that of the

The articles of the treaty were soon settled, and the contract of marriage concluded on these terms: The crown of Castile, after the death of the reigning prince, shall descend to Henry and Catherine, and the issue of their bodies; or, in default of such issue, to the children of Edmund duke of York, by Isabel, the younger sister of Constance: Two hundred thousand crowns shall be payed to the duke of Lancaster, towards the charges of his late expedition: He and his consort Constance shall receive two hundred thou∣sand florins annually, for their respective lives; and four Spanish noblemen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Froissart<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> shall be given as hostages for the payment of these annuities.

<P>The French, encouraged by the absence of this nobleman, with the choicest troops of the kingdom, persisted in their design of invading England, and carried on their preparations with incredible assiduity. At first it was surmised that they intended to besiege Calais, and young Henry Percy, surnamed Hotspur, went thither to provide for its defence: but, being better informed, he soon returned to England, where he gave notice of their destina∣tion. This was no sooner known, than the city of London was filled with terror and consternation; and the inhabitants ran about in distraction to pull down the suburbs, as if the enemy had already enoamped before the walls: nor could they recollect themselves from their fears, until the king and council assembled a great number of country militia in the neighbourhood of the city. The ports and harbours were put in a posture of defence; and all the beacons on the coast prepared for giving the alarm, whenever the enemy should appear. A great number of men at arms was posted in different parts along the shore; and a fleet of ships sent to sea, with a view to watch the motions of the French transports, and burn them after the troops should be landed. While the English were thus employed in putting the kingdom in a posture of defence, the French army assembled at Arras, to a prodigious number; and above twelve hundred vessels were collected at Sluys, which was the place appointed for their embarkation. They proposed to sail about the beginning of August; but were obliged to wait till the middle of Sep∣tember, for the duke of Berry, who did not much relish the undertaking, because it had been concerted without his concurrence: and after he arrived with a reinforcement, they were detained by contrary winds, till the latter end of October, when they set sail with a favourable gale. They had not, how∣ever, proceeded above ten leagues on their voyage, when the wind veered about, and increased to a violent storm, which scattered their whole navy: part of it was driven back into the harbour of Sluys; part dashed upon the rocks; and a considerable number of straggling ships were taken by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Juv.

<P>England being now freed from the terrors of that cloud, which had so long hovered over her with portentous aspect, the militia which had been convened for the security of the city of London, was dismissed, though not before they had produced inexpressible odium and rancour in the minds of the people against the minister Michael de la Pole, who had made no provision for their subsistence, and therefore allowed them to live at free∣quarter.

The councils of England had never been more weak and undeter∣mined<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n at this juncture. The ministry acted with the utmost timidity and distraction; while the king, at the head of a mutinous army, indulged h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s passions with the most unb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dled licentiousness. His profusion still went hand in hand with his profligacy and intemperance. He now created the marq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is of Dublin duke of Ireland, and he himself retained nothing but the bare sovereignty of that kingdom. The archbishop of Canterbury, a prelate of worth and ability, was set aside, and retired from all public concerns; while he of York, a person of a quite different character, engrossed a great share o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his sovereign's favour. The dukes of York and Gloucester repined at their want of importance; the nation was dissatisfied, and the people called aloud for an impeachment against the earl of Suffolk. Such was the situation of England, when the king assembled a parliament at Westminster, on the first day of October; and the session was opened by a speech from the chan∣cellor, who, after having explained the nature of the debts which the king had contracted, ventured to demand a considerable subsidy from the laity and clergy; which he thought he had the better title to ask, as Richard had re∣mitted the taxes granted by the last parliament, on condition that he should go abroad, and prosecute the war in person. The commons, instead of com∣plying with this demand, expressed such resentment against the minister, that the king retired to E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tham in Kent; where he chose to dwell on his necessity, rather than give sanction by his presence to their proceedings against his fa∣vourite chancellor. The members no sooner understood his abrupt retreat, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an they appointed a committee of lords and commons to wait upon his ma∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty, and declare that they could not proceed to public business until the chancellor should be removed from his office. Richard, incensed at their presumption, commanded them in an imperious manner to consider and dis∣patch the business of the nation; and told them flatly, that he would not, at their desire, remove the meanest scullion from his kitchen. Notwithstanding this repulse, they persisted in their demand, until the king, seeing them de∣termined, thought proper to desire a conference with forty members, em∣powered to act in the name of the whole parliament. This proposal might have been complied with, had not some interested incendiaries industriously spread a report, that the king's aim was to secure and murder these represen∣tatives. The parliament, alarmed at these insinuations, deputed the duke of Gloucester and the bishop of Ely, as ambassadors, to expostulate in a friendly manner with the king, on the indiscretion of his conduct, and the ruinous measures of his ministry; as well as to declare the sentiments of the whole as∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbly, touching their full purpose and final resolution to do justice upon those evil counsellors, who had been the source of such misery and oppres∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on to the nation.

<P>The commons, not contented with the removal of Suffolk, impeached him in full parliament, of having purchased lands and tenements of the king at an under-value; of having neglected to put in execution an or∣dinance of the last parliament, appointing nine lords to examine into the state of the realm, and give their advice towards its improvement: of having per∣verted to other uses a tax which had been granted for the safe-guard of the sea, which was shamefully neglected, to the great prejudice of the realm: of having purchased for himself, and his heirs, a grant of fifty pounds a year out of the customs of Kingston upon Hull, which had been bestowed by the king's grandfather upon the Tydeman de Limberg; but since forfeited by the said Tydeman, of whom the earl had purchased it, though he was not igno∣rant of the forfeiture; and of having, by false insinuations, prevailed upon the king to confirm the said purchase: of having obtained from the pope a pension for his son John, upon the hospital of St. Anthony, to the prejudice and disherison of the high master of the said hospital, or of the king, as the high master happened to be a schismatic: of having procured divers charters and pardons for murders, treasons, felonies, and other crimes; and, in par∣ticular, a charter of certain franchises to the castle of Dover, in disherison of the crown, and subversion of the laws and king's courts of judicature: and, lastly, of having misapplied ten thousand marks, which were raised for the relief of Ghent; by which misapplication, that city was lost, together with part of the money. The earl made such a weak defence against these articles, that the king himself, who was present at the trial, could not help shaking his head, and exclaiming, "Ah! Michael, Michael, see what thou hast done!" He was convicted, and committed to the custody of the duke of Gloucester, who, as constable of the kingdom, sent him prisoner to Windsor-Castle; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham. Rot.

<P>The parliament having thus brought the chancellor to condign pu∣nishment, appointed a committee of eleven noblemen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were the king's two uncles, dukes of York and Gloucester; William archbishop of Canterbury, Alexander archbishop of York, the bishops of Winchester and Exeter, the abbot of Waltham, Richard earl of Arundel, John lord Cobham, Richard Le Scroop, and John Devereux.</NOTE>, to inspect the state of the revenue since the king's accession, and to reform the abuses of the ad∣ministration. The king himself took an oath to abide by their decisions: and the parliament decreed, that any person who might presume to advise a revo∣cation of the powers granted to this committee, should forfeit his estate for the first attempt, and, for the second, suffer death as a traitor, even though his advice should not be followed. The commission granted to this council im∣plied, that the king of his own free will, and at the request of his parliament, had changed the great officers of the crown, for the better execution of the laws, the relief of his own estate, and the ease of his people; and appointed eleven commissioners as a new council, for one year after the date of the letters patent, to inspect the oeconomy of his houshold, and the government of the realm; to receive and disburse all his revenue, subsidies, taxes, and other payments; and to amend every thing that was amiss, according to their dis∣cretion. The same powers were vested in any six of the number, in conjunc∣tion with his three great officers; and if any dispute should happen between
<PB N="164" REF="1660"/>
these officers and counsellors, the majority of these last had the right of deter∣mination. All the nobility and prelates, the officers of state and of the houshold, judges, justices, barons, sheriffs, mayors, bailiffs, and all persons whatsoever, were enjoined to be obedient, counselling, and assisting to the said counsellors, as often as, and in what manner, they should direct. When they had in this manner circumscribed the king's prerogative, they freely voted a considerable subsidy for the defence of the nation; and the greatest part of the money arising from their grant was deposited in the hands of the earl of Arundel, lord high admiral of England, to be expended in se∣curing the coast from the descent of the enemy. In order to make some amends for the freedoms they had taken with the king and his administration, they granted the ransom of the heirs of Charles de Blois to his favourite the duke of Ireland, on condition that he should repair to that kingdom before Easter, and recover at his own expence, from the Irish rebels, the great estate which had been granted to him with his last patent. This indulgence was no other than a gentle method taken to separate him from the king, who per∣ceived their drift, and glowed with indignation at the insults they had offered to his authority. On the very last day of the session, when he had nothing further to hope or fear from their resolutions, he gave a loose to his resent∣ment, which he had hitherto suppressed; and protested in full parliament, that nothing done in that session should prejudice him, his crown, or royal pre∣rogative. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>After the dismission of this parliament, the new council began to take measures for defeating the schemes of the enemy. Treaties of alliance were brought upon the carpet with several foreign potentates, particularly with the court of Gueldre, and the republic of Genoa, which was at this period one of the strongest maritime powers in Europe. The English cruizers, especially those fitted out from the Cinque-Ports, harrassed the trade of France, and committed depredations upon their coasts with great success; and young Henry Piercy began to render himself famous by his hostile excur∣sions from Calais, where he served as a volunteer. Richard, mean while, was reduced to such necessity by his extravagance and excess, that he was obliged to borrow money of his subjects, to whom, as a security, he granted assignments on the taxes to be laid by the ensuing parliament. He released the earl of Suffolk, and re-admitted him into his councils and confidence: he retained the duke of Ireland about his person; continued immersed in riot and debauchery; and seemed bent upon revoking every thing which had passed in the late parliament. While he thus indulged himself at Windsor, in the midst of sycophants and pandars, the citizens of London, being introduced by his two uncles and other noblemen, presented a petition, requesting that he would dismiss his ministers, who were no other than blood-suckers that preyed upon him and the nation, and allow them to be secured until they could be brought to trial, and punished according to their demerit. Richard, startled at this application, thought proper to temporize, and soothe them with ge∣neral promises of redress: but they had no sooner withdrawn, than his fa∣vourites interpreted the manner of this address into open rebellion; and they are said to have concerted a plan for assassinating the duke of Gloucester and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roiffart.</NOTE> some other chiefs of the opposition.</P>

<P>The earl of Arundel exerted himself so industriously in equipping a fleet, that in the beginning of the year he was in a condition to put to sea, just as the French had laid up their vessels for that season. In his cruise he fell in with a rich fleet of Spanish, French, and Flemish ships, under the convoy of a squadron from Flanders and Castile, which he attacked with great fury, and met with a warm reception. The battle was fought for some time with equal obstinacy on both sides; but victory at length declared for the English, who took the Flemish admiral and six and fifty ships that were under his protection. They afterwards pursued the fugitives two days successively, until the number of their prizes amounted to one hundred and twenty-six, the greater part of which was taken by the earl of Nottingham, a young nobleman of a very pro∣mising genius. These ships were scarce brought into harbour, when advice came, that Brest was again besieged by the French forces. The earl im∣mediately set sail for Brittany, where he raised the blockade of Brest, demo∣lished two forts which had been raised by the enemy to strengthen the place, and supplied it with a whole year's provision.</P>

<P>By this time the French council had altered their plan of inva∣sion; and, instead of embarking at Sluys, resolved to divide their armament, and make two different descents in Suffolk and Kent, the first to be com∣manded by John de Vienne, and the other by the constable de Clisson, who was ordered to embark at Lhan Trequier, in Brittany. John de Montfort duke of this province had been so insolently treated, and his subjects so grie∣vously oppressed by the French government, that he formed the resolution of renouncing his dependence on that crown, and throwing himself again into the hands of the English. With this view he had actually engaged in a pri∣vate negotiation with Richard; and the constable suspecting him of some such design, kept a watchful eye on his conduct. He had communicated his sus∣picion to the council of France, and even prevailed with them to ransom the son of his old competitor Charles de Blois, who still remained an hostage in England. Montfort, alarmed at this transaction, from whence he easily con∣ceived the motive of the French ministry, which was to set up the young De Blois as his rival in the dutchy; and being moreover actuated by the furies of jealousy against the constable, who is said to have been enamoured of his dutchess, he determined to surprize that nobleman before he should be aware of his intention. The forces under the constable's command being cantoned at Lentriguet in Brittany, the duke invited him to an entertainment at Vannes, where, after having treated him with particular marks of distinction and friend∣ship, he caused him to be arrested, loaded with shackles, and imprisoned in a dungeon: a perfidious breach of hospitality, by which however he dispelled his own apprehension, gratified his personal resentment, and recommended himself effectually to the English; for, as the constable was the soul of the pur∣posed invasion, his misfortune was no sooner known than the French counsels were disconcerted; the troops, which placed all their success in the valour and<NOTE PLACE="marg">D' Argentré.

<P>Richard and his minions in all appearance were sorry for this event, which defeated a design that might have proved fatal to the nation; for they saw no other prospect of being able to shake off the trammels of the coun∣cil,
<PB N="166" REF="1680"/>
but that of its growing into disgrace with the people, from the miscarriage of its measures. The king repined at the success of the earl of Nottingham, who was lord mares<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hal, and even envied his reputation. When that noble∣man returned to court, after having so gallantly distinguished himself under the admiral, he met with a cold and mortifying reception, though he had been brought up with Richard from his infancy. The earl of Arundel was utterly neglected, and his commission of admiral given to Henry Piercy sur∣named Hotspur, whose courage, in the opinion of the favourites, would ei∣ther eclipse the fame of Nottingham and Arundel, and overballance the popu∣larity they had acquired, or induce him to engage in enterprizes that might end in his destruction; for they knew he was no well-wisher to the court, and therefore invested him with this command, which would either finish the ca∣reer of his ambition or excite an emulation and resentment between two fac∣tious chiefs of the opposition. Though he was poorly equipped, he under∣took the charge of guarding the coast, and executed his office with equal acti∣vity and success, scouring the channel and keeping the enemy in continual alarm. The duke of Ireland, instead of complying with the ordinance of parliament, in repairing to that kingdom, continued at court, where his in∣fluence daily increased, and encouraged the king in all his profligacy and li∣centiousness; so that he was become the object of the people's aversion, and took so little pains to be well with the nobility, that he seemed to set them all at defiance. He had married Philippa grand-daughter to king Edward III. by his daughter Isabel, wife to the lord Coucy, a lady of great virtue and ac∣complishments; and now being captivated by the beauty of one Lancerona, a Bohemian damsel who waited upon the queen, he repudiated the king's kins∣woman, and took this foreigner to his bed; while Richard overlooked the<NOTE PLACE="marg">W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>gham.</NOTE> indignity.</P>

<P>The duke of Gloucester was so incensed at the insult offered to his family, that he devoted Vere to destruction; and from that day began to take measures for delivering the kingdom from such a pernicious ministry. In an assembly of the principal noblemen at London he voluntarily made oath, in the most solemn manner to the bishop of London, that he had always served the king to the best of his judgment and the utmost of his power, and never har∣boured a thought to his prejudice. He then explained the insolence and mis∣conduct of the duke of Ireland, who had dishonoured the royal family, de∣ceived the king, and contributed to the ruin of the nation; and declared his firm resolution to bring him and his confederates to justice. The bishop, con∣vinced of Gloucester's sincerity, imparted this asseveration to the king; and the earl of Suffolk affecting to turn it into ridicule, <Q>“My lord (said the pre∣late) such language would come better from any person than from you, who stand condemned by the parliament, and owe your life to the king's clemency.”</Q> Richard, exasperated at the freedom of this expostulation, not only reproached the bishop for his presumption, but ordered him to be turned out of the apartment with disgrace. Every thing now seemed to portend an open rupture between the king and the barons: the emissaries of both sides were employed to revile and expose each other; every circumstance of miscon∣duct in the king or his ministry, was aggravated by the most insidious exagge∣ration; and on the other hand, every struggle for liberty, and every precau∣tion
<PB N="167" REF="1690"/>
of self-defence, was interpreted into the efforts of lawless ambition, and a premeditated design of mutiny and rebellion. The opposition was conducted by the king's two uncles, the earls of Nottingham, Arundel, Warwick, and Derby the eldest son of John duke of Lancaster, who had distinguished himself for his courage and sagacity, and married the younger daughter and coheir of Humphrey de Bohun earl of Hereford and Northampton. These two earldoms, with the lordship of Brecknock, he enjoyed in right of this mar∣riage; and the king had two years before this period created him earl of Derby; so that he was one of the most powerful noblemen in England, even during the life of his father, whom he greatly excelled in point of understanding and policy. These noblemen having engaged in an association against the ministry, retired to their respective habitations in the country, with a view to raise forces for the execution of their design; and they had no sooner quitted London, than the king ordered several citizens of their faction to be apprehended for high treason. They were so intimidated by this unexpected arrest, that in order to save their lives, they confessed what they knew of the plan which the lords of the opposition had formed; and the court dismissed them without further punishment, in order to make a merit of such clemency, and engage the peo∣ple in the king's interest. This measure was artfully taken, and produced a considerable effect in Richard's favour. The same expedient was repeated at Coventry with the same success; and the king and queen, with the archbishop of York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, and his other favourites, made a progress into the western counties, in hope of prevailing upon the peo∣ple to espouse the royal cause, or at least of influencing the election for a new parliament, that it might be more propitious than the last, which had so inso∣lently abridged the prerogative.</P>

<P>Having made an excursion to the borders of Wales they returned to Nottingham, to which place they had summoned the sheriffs of the counties, the principal citizens of London, and the judges of England: they tampered with the first to return such members as would buckle to the court measures, with the citizens to furnish men and money to quell the opposition, and with the judges to strain the laws in favour of the administration. The sheriffs and citizens were proof against all their threats and promises, but the chief justice Tresilian expressed his readiness to oblige the ministry, by preparing an in∣dictment against the lords of the opposition, founded upon certain principles to be pronounced law by the judges. These being tutored for the purpose, de∣clared, in an authentic instrument, that the ordinance and commission enacted and granted in the last parliament, was derogatory to the king's prerogative; and those who procured it, ought to be punished with death; that those who straitened the king in the exercise of his prerogative, ought to be punished as traitors; that the king had a right to call and govern a parliament, to propose the subjects of their deliberation, and prescribe the method in which they should proceed; that those who postponed the subjects so specified, and proceeded to other business contrary to the king's pleasure, were guilty of treason, and ought to be punished accordingly; that the king had a right to dissolve the parliament, and command the members to depart, on pain of being punished as traitors; that the lords and commons had no right to impeach in parliament any of the king's judges or officers, without the leave of his majesty; and those who

took that liberty were traitor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; that he who moved in the last parliament, for perusing the statute of deposition against Edward II. was a traitor, as well as he who brought it into par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ament, in consequence of that motion; and that the j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dgment given against the earl of Suffolk was erroneous and revocable. Such were the opinions given at the castle of Nottingham, by Robert Tresilian chief justice of England, Robert Belknap chief justice of the common pleas, and his associates John Holt, Roger Fulthorp, William de Burgh, and John Locton the king's serjeant at law, who sealed the instrument in presence of Alexander archbishop of York, Robert archbishop of Dublin, John bishop of Durham, Thomas bishop of Chichester, and John bishop of Bangor, Robert duke of<NOTE PLACE="marg">W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>singham. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>While Richard and his cabal endeavoured in vain to raise forces to support him in the execution of his weak and arbitrary designs, he received intelligence that Gloucester and the confederated lords had assembled a nu∣merous army, and were on their march towards London. As the king had se∣cured a strong party by his late popular proceedings among the lower class of citizens, and Brembre the mayor was entirely at his devotion, he hastened up to that metropolis, in order to anticipate the success of his adversaries; and was received with great magnificence by Brembre, who undertook to raise fifty thou∣sand men for his service. Next day the confederates arrived with their forces at Hornsey, within three miles of London; but instead of advancing into the city and proceeding to extremities, they wisely preserved a shew of moderation and respect for the Londoners, because they knew the king had a strong fac∣tion within the walls; and the earl of Northumberland, with the lord Basset and several other powerful noblemen, were still averse to extremities, though enemies to the ministry, hoping that the grievances of the nation would be re∣dressed, in a parliament which the king had promised to assemble. In the mean time, they neglected no opportunity of increasing the number of their partisans.</P>

<P>They abstained from all acts of violence; professed a deep sense of the calamities attending civil discord; proposed schemes of accommodation; and by their private emissaries inflamed the resentment of the people against the king, by spreading false reports to his prejudice. It was reported that, under the pretext of a pilgrimage to Canterbury, Richard intended to cross the sea, and deliver up Calais to the king of France, who, in consideration of that cession, had agreed to furnish him with an army to subdue his rebellious sub∣jects, and establish an arbitrary government in England. This report, circu∣lated with a detail of circumstances which gave it an air of truth, met with the more credit, on account of the late determination of the judges, which alarmed every well-wisher to the constitution of his country. The archbishop of Can∣terbury and the neutral lords, interposed their good offices towards a pacifica∣tion; but their proposals were cooly received by Richard, until he had made
<PB N="169" REF="1710"/>
a fruitless attempt to seize the earl of Arundel in his castle at Ryegate; and not only found himself disappointed in his expectations from Brembre, but like∣wise saw the army of the confederates increased to a most formidable appearance. Then his heart failed him; and he consented to a personal interview with the duke of Gloucester and his associates, who would not, however, attend him in Westminster-Hall, until they had received a safe-conduct for the security of their persons. At the very hour fixed for this conference, they pretended to have discovered that a body of armed men, commanded by Sir Thomas Trive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Sir Nicholas Brembre, was concealed at the Mews, in order to appre∣hend and destroy them; and therefore they refused to set out for Westminster, until the avenues were examined: so that the king sat upon his throne a full hour be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore they arrived. At length they entered the hall, and approaching the throne with great submission, fell upon their knees, and remained a consi∣derable time in that posture, before Richard desired the duke of Gloucester to rise. The bishop of Ely reprimanded them in very severe terms, for having presumed to take up arms against their sovereign, who could have crushed them into dust; and then they were commanded to explain their grievances. The lords made no reply to the bishop, but still retaining the marks of hu∣mility and submission, presented a writing, in which they demanded that the archbishop of York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, Robert Tresi∣lian, and Nicholas Brembre, should be removed from his majesty's councils and presence for ever, as traitors to their king and country. Having delivered this petition they threw down their gauntlets, appealing to the combat-evidence for the truth of their allegations. Richard, intimidated by the coolness and resolution they manifested on this occasion, laid aside his imperious deport∣ment, and with great affability answered their petition. He told them their grievances should be considered and redressed, in the parliament which he had summoned to re-establish the peace of the nation; and in the mean time exhort∣ing them to avoid all quarrels and dissention, took both parties under his im∣mediate protection. Then he dismissed them, with assurances of personal kind∣ness and regard; and to convince them of his sincerity, in a few days pub∣lished a proclamation, clearing the duke of Gloucester and the earls of Arun∣del and Warwick from the imputation of treason, which had been thrown upon them by the five persons they had appealed to comb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and requiring those accusers to answer for their charge in parliament. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.

<P>Notwithstanding these appearances, the confederates still kept themselves upon their guard, because they had observed divers suspicious symptoms in the behaviour of the king, who had not suffered his favourites to appear in the interview, though he still protected them at court, and was wholly governed by their advice. The caution of the lords was far from being unnecessary. They in a little time received intelligence that the duke of Ire∣land had repaired to the Marches of Wales, where he was joined by Sir Tho∣mas Molineux, Sir Ralph Vernon, Sir Ralp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ratcliff, with several sheriffs and others, to the number of five thousand; and that his army daily increased. These tidings were no sooner reported to the confederates, than they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent the earl of Derby with a considerable detachment to stop his progress, and he en∣countered him near Radcot-Bridge in Oxfordshire. The duke had not courage to stand the first charge, but fled towards the bridge, which being broken down,
<PB N="170" REF="1720"/>
he quitted his horse and armour, and swimming across the river, escaped with great difficulty. Molineux disdaining to fly, was killed on the spot; and the earl of Derby not only obtained <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an almost bloodless victory, but among the baggage of the duke, who was supposed to have perished in the river, found a number of letters, plans, and commissions, by which the confederates disco∣vered<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This disaster intirely broke the measures of the cabal, and overwhelmed them with such consternation, that the earl of Suffolk disappeared; and with a view of escaping into France, crossed the sea in disguise to Calais, where he was discovered and seized by his own bro∣ther; and Beauchamp the governor sent him prisoner to London.</P>

<P>After the battle of Radcot-Bridge, the earl of Derby rejoined the lords at St. Albans; from whence they proceeded, at the head of forty thousand men, to London, and encamping in Clerkenwell fields, sent for the lord mayor and principal inhabitants, who waited upon them with the keys of the city. By this time Richard had taken up his residence in the Tower, where he found himself in a very forlorn condition, abandoned by every body but a few atten∣dants, who were so distracted with their own fears, that they could neither pro∣perly advise nor assist him in such an emergency. The confederates demanding an audience, he durst not refuse their request; and in this interview they expo∣stulated with him so severely, that the unhappy monarch could not help shed∣ding a flood of tears, while he promised to meet them next day at Westminster, in order to concert measures to be taken by the parliament, which was sum∣moned to meet on the third day of February. This weak prince was no sooner freed from the intimidating presence of the confederated lords, than he was persuaded by his courtiers to retract a promise which derogated so much from the dignity of a monarch; and the lords, having drawn up their whole army on Tower-Hill, which was then very extensive, that he might be terri∣fied by the sight of such a number, sent a messenger to declare that if he should continue to trifle with them, they would deliberate upon raising another prince to the throne. Alarmed at this declaration, he promised faithfully to keep his appointment at Westminster, and punctually fulfilled his engagement. There he complied with every thing they proposed; and gave up all his favourites, without distinction of sex or quality. The archbishop of York and the bishop of Chichester had already accomplished a retreat. Among those that re∣mained were the bishop of Durham, fri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Rushak the king's confessor, the lords Zouch of Haringworth, Burnel, and Beaumont, Sir Alberic de Vere, Sir Baldwin Beresford, Sir John Worth, Sir Thomas Clifford, Sir John Lovel, together with several ladies of loose morals, who had conduced to the corruption and profligacy of the court. These were either confined in different parts of the kingdom, obliged to give security for their appearance in court, to whatever might be laid to their charge, or banished the king's presence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch. 1388.</NOTE> Sir Simon Burley, Sir Thomas Trivet, Sir Nicholas Brembre, Sir John Beau∣champ of Holt, Sir William Ellingham, John Blake; and the following ec∣clesia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tics, Richard Clifford, John de Lincoln, Richard Matford, and Nicho∣las Lake, were committed to close prison, that they might be brought to trial immediately.

<P>The session of parliament was opened by Thomas Fitz-Alan, bishop of Ely and chancellor of the kingdom, who declared they were assembled to reform the administration, advise the king, and concert measures for securing the sea and the Marches of the kingdom, relieving Guienne, and raising mo∣ney in the easiest manner for these purposes. As soon as the chancellor had finished his speech, the duke of Gloucester falling upon his knees, offered to stand trial before his peers, or maintain his innocence in any other shape, touching a malicious report which had been circulated to his prejudice, as if he intended to dethrone the king and usurp the sovereign authority: but Richard declaring himself perfectly convinced of the malice of this aspersion, he was acquitted of all such suspicion. Then the lords spiritual and temporal de∣manded a confirmation of their claim, liberty, and franchises, of trying and judging all important causes, relating to the peers, in the course of parliament, independent of the common or civil law of the realm; and their claim was al∣lowed and confirmed accordingly, under the sanction<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of parliament. This ca∣pital privilege being ascertained, the five noblemen appellants stood up to ex∣hibit their appeals, when the archbishop of Canterbury, in behalf of himself and the prelates of his province, entered a protest, asserting their rights to sit as barons and peers of the realm, and hear and determine all causes whatso∣ever brought before the tribunal; and declaring that this their right should not be prejudiced by their withdrawing on this occasion, in obedience to the canons of the church, that prohibited them from assisting at any trial against the life of a fellow creature. Another declaration and protest of the same nature was made by the bishop of Durham and Carlile; and their right being acknow∣ledged, they withdrew. The temporal lords being thus left to themselves, the appellants exhibited their charge against the archbishop of York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, Sir Robert Tresilian, and Sir Nicholas Brembre, in thirty-nine articles of various texture, containing accusations of treasons and misdemeanors indiscriminately. These last consisted in their rendering the king inaccessible to his nobility, except in their presence; their intercepting the king's favours, and creating misunderstandings between him and his nobility; their obtaining grants of Ireland, and Okeham, with its forest, in favour of Ro∣bert de Vere; their bribery and corruption; their i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uing great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ums to the duke of Ireland, and obstructing the ordinances of parliament; their selling commands of importance in Guienne and the Marches of Scotland, to un∣qualified persons; their obstructing the course of law; procuring pardons for felons and traitors; maintaining suits and quarrels; excluding lords and other members from the king's council; advising the king to absent himself, and avoid treating with the last parliament; persuading him to convene some lords, judges, and others, and demand their opinions on several matters, in a suspicious manner; prevailing upon gentlemen in England and Wales, to take
<PB N="172" REF="1740"/>
oaths and give security for standing by the king against all persons, by which obligations the realm was involved in trouble and confusion; secluding the king at a distance from the commissioners appointed in parliament; ransoming John de Blois, without warrant or consent of parliament<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> er of the great coun∣cil; advising the king to distinguish his retinue with badges; procuring the opinions of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alse judges at Nottingham, in order to destroy, under colo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, all concerned in the late commission and statute; int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding to indict the lords and other<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon those opinions, and arrest the duke of Lancaster, in case he had arrived in England; persuading the king that the commission and sta∣tute were calculated <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or deposing him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the throne of his ancestors; pre∣vailing upon the companies of London to swear they would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive and die with the king against all his enemies, at a time when he looked upon the commis∣sioners to be traitors; publishing a proclamation in that city, forbidding all persons to aid or assist the earl of Arundel with arms or provisions; and ano∣ther, forbidding every body to speak with disrespect of the persons appealed; and persuading the king to send a list of persons to his council, that they might be appointed sheriffs, with a view to pack a par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iament. Sir Nicholas Brembre was charged with having ordered several criminals to be taken out of Newgate by night, and executed illegally. The duke of Ireland was accused of having acted as chief justice of Chester, without warrant or commission; of having raised forces to destroy the lords and the king's lieges, and attempting to kill the appellants at the battle of Radcot-Bridge. The other articles, amounting to a charge of treason, were their suggesting falshoods to the king, and oblig∣ing him to swear he would be governed by their counsels, and live and die in their defence; their advising his majesty to confer the title of king of Ireland on Robert de Vere; and to write to the pope for a confirmation of that title; their counselling the king to put all the lords and commons of the last parlia∣ment to death, except such as were of their own party; their persuading his majesty that the late commission and statute were made to subvert his royal au∣thority; and that all concerned in procuring and advising it ought to be pu∣nished as traitors; their prevailing upon the king to send Nicholas Southwell his valet, and other mean persons, with letters to the king of France, desiring his assistance to destroy the lords and others whom he deemed traitors; and in consideration of such assistance, promising to give up Cherbourg, Brest, and Calais; their sending to France for safe-conducts for the king, the duke of Ireland, and others, who intended to go thither and execute these treasonable desings; advising the king to issue orders for knights and gentlemen to rise with the duke of Ireland; to write letters to the said duke, representing himself in the utmost danger unless speedily relieved, pressing him to march to his assist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, and promising to meet him with all his forces. Such were the ar∣ticles exhibited against the archbishop of York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, Sir Robert Tresilian, and Sir Nicholas Brembre, who being sum∣moned in the chamber of the parliament in Westminster-Hall, and at the great gate of the palace, without appearing to answer to the charge, the appellants moved that the default might be recorded, and the lords proceed to judgment. The king ordered some judges, serjeants, and others learned in the law, to de∣liberate upon the nature of this impeachment, and deliver their opinion to the lords; and these<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after having consulted together, declared it informal, and con∣trary
<PB N="173" REF="1750"/>
to the methods of prosecution prescribed by the civil law and the statutes of the realm. Notwithstanding this declaration, the lords, with the king's consent, resolved, that in such a cause, affecting his majesty's person and the state of the kingdom, and implying such heinous crimes committed by peers and other associates, the right of trying and judging was vested in the lords of parliament, according to their franchise and liberty, to judge and be judged in such cases with the king's assent, independent of any law whatsoever; that they would proceed in the same manner with respect to the present case, and determine it by award of parliament: they therefore adjudged, that the ap∣peal was well made and duly affirmed, and the process valid according to the law and course of parliament.</P>

<P>The appellants being thus allowed to proceed, desired again that the default of the accused might be recorded; and, the citation being re∣peated, they demanded judgment. The king and the lords temporal, without having examined any evidence, being in their consciences persuaded of the truth of the articles, pronounced the persons appealed guilty of high treason. Their estates were forfeited, the archbishop's temporalities seized, and his person was reserved for further deliberation; but the others were sentenced to be drawn and hanged as traitors. Tresilian being betrayed by his own servant, was taken in a mean disguise, and brought before the parliament, which or∣dered him to be executed immediately at Tyburn. The earl of Suffolk and duke of Ireland had fled beyond sea. Alexander archbishop of York was seized at Shields, attempting to go on board of a ship in disguise; but the duke of Gloucester would not inflict any punishment on his person, lest he should disoblige the prelates of his party; and prevailed upon the pope to translate him from York to St. Andrew's in Scotland. This translation, how∣ever, did not take place, because Scotland acknowledged the authority of Clement the antipope; and Alexander was allowed to retire to Flanders, where he served the cure of a small parish till the day of his death. The earl of Suffolk did not many months survive his disgrace; and the duke of Ire∣land died in a few years at Louvain, of the wounds he received in hunting a wild boar in Brabant. Sir Nicholas Brembre being brought before the par∣liament to hear the articles read, denied the charge; and, as a knight, claimed the privilege of proving his innocence in single combat: but this mo∣tion being over-ruled by the parliament, he was brought to the bar, con∣demned, and delivered into the hands of the earl mareschal; who, with the mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs of London, attended at his execution. These prosecutions being discussed, the lords spiritual and temporal declared that nothing contained in the appeal should reflect upon the king himself, or be interpreted to the prejudice of his person. Then the commons proceeded to impeach the other evil counsellors, by whom his majesty had been misled. The judges, who delivered and signed their opinions at Nottingham, were condemned to die as traitors; their heir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were disinherited, and their estates forfeited: the same sentence was denounced against John Blake for drawing up the questions, and Thomas Huske for aidi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g and abetting the scheme of arresting and indicting the noblemen of the opposition. These were hurried to immediate execution; but the judges were, through the inter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession of the bishops, pardoned as to life and limb, though sent into perpetual exile in dif∣ferent

He sailed again in autumn with a numerous fleet, having on board the earl of Nottingham, the lord Clifford, Sir Thomas Piercy, and many other volunteers of distinction, with a body of six thousand land forces. His purpose was not only to har∣rass the French, but to persuade the duke of Brittany to declare openly against Charles. This noble fleet, however, was dispersed by a terrible storm; and the earl himself, with seven and twenty ships, obliged to take refuge in the small port of La Pates, within a league of Rochelle. The castle of Bouteville, in that neighbourhood, was then besieged by the marechal de Sancerre, who, being informed of the earl's arrival and shattered condition, ordered the in∣habitants to block up the harbour with eight gallies; while, raising the siege, he marched with his army to attack them by land, so that he thought they could not possibly escape. But he was baffled by the vigilance and activity of Arundel, who had refitted his ships before the other could execute his plan; and, having intelligence of the marechal's design, put to sea, in order to meet the gallies, which he intirely destroyed; then returning to the harbour, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding his men, he drove the French general to the gates of Rochelle. While his troops lay encamped in this place, he was joined by La Bernoy, who commanded the fort of Galuset in the Limousin <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the king of England; and many skirmishes were fought with various success: but all hope of the duke's d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>claring against France in a little time vanished; for, although the French king deeply resented the indignity which had been offered to his constable, Montfort was secretly favoured by the dukes of Berry and Bur∣gundy, who envied the greatness and reputation of De Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sson: and it was considered as a point of such importance to detach the duke of Brittany from his connexion with England, that Charles thought proper to overlook the outrage he had committed, and even allow him to exact an heavy ransom of

Being gratified with an annual pension of a tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd pounds, he declared war against France; but, Charles marching into his country, he was intimidated, and sued for pardon, which he obtai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d on condition of renouncing his alliance with England. The ac∣commod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion effected between these powers, left Richard without an ally on the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nent whom he could use for the annoyance of his enemies; while his British dominions were insulted by the Scots, who made continual irrup∣tions into the northern counties. The younger Douglas and the earl of Fife had landed in Ireland, where they took the town of Carlingford, with fifteen ships, defeated the Irish in battle, and plundered the Isle of Man in their re∣turn. To revenge these depredations, the lords of the Marches entered Scot∣land, and ravaged the Merse; but retired in a hurry upon receiving intelli∣gence that the Scottish army was on its march to give them battle. A commission was given to the bishop of Durham, the earl of Northumberland, and other lords, to treat of a pacification with the Scots: but, their endea∣vours proving ineffectual, the bishop of Sodor and Man was empowered to negotiate with Donald lord of the Isles, that he might fall upon the north of Scotland; but neither did this negotiation take effect. The Scottish parlia∣ment, assembled at Aberdeen, resolved to send two armies into England; and this scheme was immediately executed. One of these bodies, commanded by the earls of Douglas, Fife, and Dunbar, advanced beyond Newcastle, and ravaged the whole bishopric of Durham: then they encamped before New∣castle, which was defended by the famous Hotspur, his brother Sir Ralph, and almost all the gentlemen of the northern counties. The Scottish army consisted of three hundred horse and two thousand infantry; and therefore could not pretend to invest the whole town: so that their intent was only to provoke Piercy to come forth and hazard a battle. While they continued in this situation, the volunteers on both sides distinguished themselves in skir∣mishes and trials of valour. At length, the English making a general sally, an engagement ensued, during which Piercy and Douglas encountered each other on horseback, in sight of both armies: they were nearly of the same age, and rivals in reputation; so that both sides suspended their efforts to see the iss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of this combat. At the first shock Piercy was unhorsed, and would have fallen into the hands of his antagonist, had not his men rushed in be∣tween them, and conveyed him to the town; but Douglas had won his lance and pennon, which he waved over his head, calling aloud, that he would carry it as a trophy of his victory into Scotland. So saying, he ordered his people to decamp, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ving Piercy to all the horrors of mortified ambition. He swore that Douglas should never carry his lance into Scotland; and, as∣sembling six hundred horse and eight thousand infantry, set out in pursuit of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e enemy, without waiting for the succours which were on the march from
<PB N="177" REF="1790"/>
all quarters, to serve under his banner. The Scots, in their retreat, had un∣dertaken the siege of the strong castle of Otterburn, before which they lay en∣camped when they were overtaken by Piercy, who instantly attacked them with great impetuosity, though the day was almost spent before he could begin the battle. He found Douglas ready to receive him; and the fight was maintained with equal obstinacy on both sides, until the combatants were parted by the darkness: in a few hours, however, the English renewed the attack by moon-light; and Piercy fought with such fury to retrieve his ho∣nour, that the Scots were put into disorder, and began to give ground. Douglas, being informed of this circumstance, rushed into the midst of the English with his battle-axe in his hand, hewing down all before him, until his retreat was intercepted, and he was environed by his enemies, without any other second than his own chaplain, who had followed his steps, and been animated by his example, to perform wonders of valour. His friends no sooner learned his situation, than they penetrated to the place, where they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound him fainting with loss of blood from three mortal wounds which he had re∣ceived, and his chaplain defending him singly against a multitude of foes. Having obliged the English to give way in their turn, they would have con∣veyed their general from the field; but that valiant chief, feeling his end ap∣proaching, would not suffer himself to be moved: he desired they would conceal his fate, and revenge his death upon the enemy. He expired imme∣diately after he had given these directions: then his friends, throwing a clo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k over his body, erected his standard; and, pronouncing his name as a word of encouragement, made such a desperate effort, that the English gave way, and were totally routed, after Piercy, with his brother, and above an hundred gentlemen and officers of distinction, had been taken pisoners, and twelve hundred left dead on the field of battle. The bishop of Durham, advancing at the head of ten thousand men to join Piercy, no sooner understood the fate of this engagement, than, instead of attacking the victors, who, being ex∣hausted with fatigue, might have been easily defeated, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e retired with preci∣pitation to Newcastle; and allowed the Scots to carry off their prisoners and booty at their own leisure. The other body, which had entered England by Car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le, plundered the west borders, burned villages, took a great number of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froiss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt.

<P>During these transactions in Britain, the duke of Lancaster, being<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

At length, conferences were opened in the church of Lenlinghen, between Calais and Bou∣logne, where a truce was conclud<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for thr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e yea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s between the two kingdo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; and Robert king of Scotland acceded to this agreement. Peace being thus restored to England, Richard resolved to ensranchise himself from the thraldom in which he had been hitherto kept by the lords of the opposition. In an ex∣traordinary council of the nobility assembled after Easter, he, to the astonish∣ment of all present, desired to know his own age; and being told that he was turn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of two and twenty, "Well then (said he) I am certainly of age to govern my kingdom; and I s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> no r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on for my b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing deprived of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight

"Yes, he repl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have been long under the management of tutors, whom I will now remove from my council, and endea∣vour to manage my own affairs." Then he ordered Thomas Arundel the new ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hbishop of York to give up the seal, which he next day delivered to Wil∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am of Wickham bishop of Winchester. The duke of Gloucester, the earl of Warw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and other lords of the opposition, were removed from the council. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hop of Hereford lost his office of treasurer; the earl of Arundel was deprived of his post of high admiral; the keeper of the privy seal, all the great officers of the state and the houshold, together with the judges, were changed, and every place filled with persons in whom the king thought he could intirely confide. These measures were followed by a procl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mation, sig∣nifying to the subjects that the king had taken the government of the realm into his own hands; and that they might expect to see the peace of the nation better preserved, and justice more equitably administred than they had been be∣fore this a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teration. At the same time he confirmed the pardons of the last parliament; and as a proof of his moderation and tenderness for his people, suspend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the payment of the subsidy granted in the last session at Cam∣bridge. At this juncture the duke of Lancaster returned to England, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.</NOTE> effected a reconciliation between the king and the duke of Gloucester. As a recompence for this service, he was, in the parliament which met at West∣minster in January, created duke of Aquitaine, and invested with the en∣signs<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1390.</NOTE> of honour belonging to that dignity. Edward Plantagenet, son to the duke of York, was also gratified with the earldom of Rutland, and a pen∣sion of eight hundred marks to support his new dignity. On the fourth day of the session the bishop of Winchester resigned the great seal to the king; the bishop of St. David's delivered up the keys of the exchequer, which he kept as treasurer; and all the lords of the council were discharged, at their own desire. Then they asked in open parliament, if any person had ought to say against their conduct; which the commons having examined, declared themselves perfectly well satisfied with all their transactions. The king, im∣mediately after this declaration, restored them to their places, and the dukes of Lancaster and Gloucester were added to t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e council; though the king pro∣tested, that for any thing then done, he would retain or remove these counsel∣lors according to his own pleasure. As the oppressive practices of the court of Rome were by this time grown almost intolerable, the commons petitioned, that the statutes enacted against th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se encroachments upon the royal authority, and the liberties of the nation, in the reigns of Edward I. and his grandson, should be punctually executed, and further regulations made for the redress o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that grievance. The archbishops, alarmed at this petition, entered a pro∣test, in beha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of themselves and their clergy; declaring, that they would not give their assent to the revival of any old statute, or the passing any new law against the authority of the pope, or in prejudice of the ecclesiastical <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>berties. Notwithstanding t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is declaration, Richard so far complied with the request of the commons, as to order the former statute to be put in execution; and they, in consideration of this indulgence, granted a considerable subsidy on wool and leather, for the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of the kingdom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as the duration of the truce was d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s

and uncertain. This subsidy was continued for three years by the next<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl.</NOTE> parliament, which met on the twelfth day of November. It was in this ses∣sion that the grant of a thousand pounds a year, made to the dukes of York and Gloucester was confirmed to them and their heirs; the parliament unani∣mously declared, that the royalty and prerogative of the king and his crown should be saved and maintained; and whatever had been done or attempted against them redressed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd amended; so as that the king should be as free as any of his progenitors. Such was the harmony subsisting between Ri∣chard and this parliament, that before it broke up the lords and commons presented their humble thanks to the king for his good government, and the great affection and zeal he had continually manifested for the happiness o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his people.</P>

<HEAD>§ LVII.</HEAD>
<P>All opposition to the king's measures had been suspended since the last reconciliation between him and Gloucester, who had been always at the head of the malecontents; and the earl of Derby, who was the soul of that party, had obtained leave to go abroad and serve as a volunteer against the infidels in Prussia, where he acquired great reputation for his military exploits. Richard's new ministers were men of more capacity and less exceptionable mo∣rals, than were the idle favourites who had formerly influenced his conduct; and his own manner of living, though still extravagant, was such as generally acquires the favour of the public. He instituted solemn tilts and tournaments, and revived the spirit of chivalry which prevailed in the reign of his grandfa∣ther. Nothing was seen but pageantry and procession of knights in armour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1391.</NOTE> led in silver chains by their mistresses to the lists, where they contended in feats of arms amidst infinite crouds of people. The king himself and all his courtiers mingled in this mimickry of warfare; and the queen, accompanied by all her ladies, graced the field with her presence. All was musick and min∣strelsy, feasting and rejoicing, the land was blessed with plenty a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter two years of dearth, and the subjects enjoyed a recess from dreadful ravages and bur∣thensome taxes, to which they had been so long exposed. During this season of good humour, another parliament was called at Westminster in the begin∣ning of November, when the declaration, touching the king's full enjoyment of his royalty, was renewed with this addition, "Notwithstanding any statute or ordinance formerly made in derogation thereof, particularly in the reign of king Edward II." And this was passed into an act of parliament. Over and above this instance of their loyalty and affection, they voted him a whole tenth and fifteenth to defray the expence of his voyage to France, whither he was in∣vited by the French monarch, in order to compromise personally all their differences, and establish a lasting accommodation. Besides this aid, they granted others for the occasions of state, and thought they had a right to expect some extraordinary condescension on the side of his majesty. In these senti∣ments, the knights of the shires petitioned, that, as it was a common practice in corporations to admit as burgesses into their communities, all villains or copyholders, after they had lived a year and a day among them unreclaimed, the lords of the manour might be impowered to enter such burroughs, and bring away the villains who were parcel of their property. This petition was rejected, as an attack upon the privileges of corporations; nor did he think proper to grant the other, in which the whole body of the commons concur∣red, proposing an act for disabling the villains of copyholders, of prelates and
<PB N="180" REF="1820"/>
monasteries, to purchase lands in see; and from hindering all villains from send∣ing their sons to school, wher<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by they obtained learning, and freed themselves from their servility, to the prejudice of the right and honour of the freeholders in England. Nowithstanding these repulses, the parliament had great reason<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rl.</NOTE> to be pleased with Richard's conduct in this session. The schism in the church still continued; and Boniface IX. being elect<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the place of Urban, sent a nuncio to the court of England, to use his best endeavours for a repeal of the statutes of proviso, and others which had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nacted against the encroach∣ments of papal authority; as well as for preventi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g a peace between Richard and Charles of France, who supported the antipope Benedict XIII. The nuncio executed his commission with great ability, and Richard seemed to listen with pleasure to his suggestions; but, as he would take no step that would deviate from the scheme of popularity he had projected, he referred the pope's propo∣sitions to the parliament, by which they were disapproved; while a peace with France was strongly recommended. Richard acquiesced in their senti∣ments, and declared his intention to confer with the king of France in person. The great corporations, convents, and other communities of the kingdom, vied with each other in assisting him to make an appearance suitable to his dig∣nity. He was furnished with rich equipages, and presented with large sums of money; and a great number of young noblemen and knights resolved to ac∣company him to this interview. In the mean time, commissioners were ap∣pointed to treat with France and Scotland, and all parties agreed that a gene∣ral congress should be held at Amiens, where the treaty of peace might be con∣cluded and ratified in presence of the two monarchs.</P>

Ch. 1392.</NOTE> At the time appointed, Charles of France, with his brother and three uncles, repaired to Amiens; and Richard went as far as Dover in his way to the interview; but whether he altered his resolution of his own accord, or was diverted from his purpose by the representations of his council, his voyage was postponed, and he remained in Dover-Castle with the duke of Gloucester, while his other two uncles, with the earls of Huntingdon and Derby, the bishops of London and Derby, Sir Thomas Piercy, and others of his council, proceeded to Amiens in quality of ambassadors and plenipotentiaries. They entered that place with a train of twelve hundred horse, and during their stay were maintained at the expence of the French king, who treated them in a sumptuous manner. The conferences were immediately opened; but such dif∣ficulties occurred, as there was no probability of surmounting. The French in∣sisted upon the demolition of Calais; and the English demanded the restitution of all the places they had lost in France, since the treaty of Bretigny, together with the payment of the last moiety of king John's ransom. Charles was willing that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he crown of England should enjoy the nine bishopri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and all its possessions in Guienne, independent of any sovereignty, and even offered to pay the ransom within three years, on condition that Calais should be demolished; but this was an artic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e concerning which the duke of Lancaster remained inflexible, declaring he had no powers to grant him such concession. The truce was therefore prolonged till Michaelmas of the ensuing year, and the terms of the peace as proposed by France referred to the consideration of the English council.

debate ensuing, the duke of Gloucester observed that they had no power to proceed with the treaty without the advice and consent of a parliament, as the affair of Calais was of the utmost importance to the kingdom: a definitive an∣swer therefore could not be given, until the matter should have been debated in the great assembly of the nation; but in the mean time the prolongation of the truce was ratified by his majesty in council.</P>

<P>The treaty at Amiens produced little advantage to any person<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.</NOTE> but the duke of Lancaster, who received the whole subsidy granted in the last parliament, or at least the better part of it, to indemnify him for the expence of his voyage. With respect to the grant of Guienne, which he had obtained, he met with some difficulties that were not easily surmounted. The order which the king had sent for his being put in possession of that dutchy was disputed by the people of Bourdeaux, Bayonne, and other principal cities, as well as the noblesse of the country, who imagined this grant implied an alienation of the province, and an intire separation from the crown of England, contrary to the privilege of holding their lands immediately of the king or his eldest son, and of no other person. They likewise found a defection in the grant, which, though it conveyed to the duke of Lancaster the dutchy with all its rights, revenues, and appurtenances, requiring all persons to do homage and fealty to him, contained no clause which released them from the allegiance they had sworn to Richard. They moreover suspected that the grant was obtained in a surreptitious manner, or by compulsion; and, in order to dispel their doubts, and remove their exceptions, the prelates, nobility, and cities of Guienne, sent over deputies to learn the king's pleasure from his own mouth. These arrived about Midsumme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at Nottingham, where Richard had assembled a great coun∣cil to deliberate upon the treaty with France<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and having explained their em∣bassy, the king assured them that he had made the grant of his own free will, with the consent of parliament, for the duke's natural life only. He con∣firmed all liberties and privileges of the clergy, nobility, cities, and commons of Guienne, in an instrument signed by himself, and authenticated by the great seal of England.</P>

<P>During the session of this council, a dangerous insurrection happened<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> at London. Richard, whose extravagance and profusion very often reduced him to great necessities, had attempted to borrow a thousand pounds of the ci∣tizens of London, who not only refused to grant his request, but insulted and abused a Lombard merchant who offered to accommodate his majesty. The king, incensed at this aggravated affront, revoked all exemptions which had been granted by his father and himself, to excuse individuals from public offices in cities, counties, and corporations; and the mayor of London with the sheriffs were ordered to attend the council at Nottingham, where they and the whole city were convicted of a riot, and obliged to submit themselves to the king's mercy in a bond of one hundred thousand pounds. In the mean time they were deprived of their offices and committed to prison; and Sir Edward Dalyngrygge was appointed warden of the city: yet they were soon released, and their antient form of government restored. The Londoners in general favoured the doctrine of Wickliff, and were of consequence exposed to the ill offices of the bishops, whom they hated accordingly. A baker having been insulted in the street, by a domestic belonging to the bishop of Salisbury, the common people took the alarm; and, assembling in great numbers, would have set fire
<PB N="182" REF="1840"/>
to the prelate's palace, had not they been with difficulty restrained by the ma∣g stracy. The bishop complaining to the king of this outrage, Richard issued out a writ for commissioners of oyer and terminer, to sit at Eaton and try the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nquents; and the dukes of Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter and York presided at the trial.

The citizens, humbled by the loss of their franchises, and dreading the bond which hung over their heads, implored the queen's intercession with great humility, and were par∣doned at her request. The king made a public entry into the city, where he was received amidst the acclamations of the people, and received very valuable<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1393.</NOTE> presents: the fine was remitted, the bond cancelled, their liberties were re∣stored, and their charters confirmed.</P>

R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.</NOTE> The parliament, meeting on the twentieth day of January, seem to have waved all deliberations concerning a new treaty with France, because Charles, having been seized with a disorder in his brain, was rendered inca∣pable of managing the reins of government, and the affairs of the realm con∣tinued in confusion, until the regency was vested in the dukes of Berry and Burgundy. The commons granted a conditional subsidy, in case of a war with France or Scotland, or of the king's heading an expedition in person; for, as they knew his want of oeconomy, they did not think proper to grant him any superfluous supply. Several laws had been enacted, in the four pre∣ceding parliaments, against the encroachments of the papal power in England. The pope's agent had been obliged to swear he would be true to the king and his crown, and keep his laws and rights inviolate; that he would take no step that should be prejudicial to the royal authority, or the laws of the kingdom, nor execute any papal bulls or mandates to the detriment of the king, or con∣trary to the laws of the realm; that he would not receive or publish any of the pope's letters, without having first communicated them to the council; no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd any money or plate out of the kingdom, without a special licence from the king or his council. Every person was subjected to a premunire, who should go or send out of England to provide or purchase for himself any ecclesiastical benefice: statutes against provisors were revived, and a stop was put to the collection of a tenth imposed by the pope upon the clergy of England. The archbishops and prelates had issued mandates for levying this tax, but were ordered to revoke them, and return the money which had been raised; and the agent was prohibited on pain of life and limb from proceeding farther in the collection. His holiness, alarmed at these measures, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent over a nuncio (as we have already observed) to sollicit the repeal or suspension of the statute against provisors; but all he could obtain was a permission of collating to the benefices that should fall vacant in the court of his holiness. This permis∣sion he had egregiously abused, in issuing bulls for translating bishops to poorer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees, with their own consent; and then filling up the rich vacancies in favour of those who payed exorbitant sums for the nomination. In this parliament the commons made a strong remonstrance, complaining, that the pope trans∣lated English prelates to foreign sees, and from one bishopric to another, with∣out the knowledge and consent of the king, and even of the bishops so trans∣lated; a practice by which the statutes of the kingdom would be defeated, the lieges of his majesty's council removed o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the realm against their own in∣clinations,
<PB N="183" REF="1850"/>
and the treasure of the nation exported; so that it would in a little time become destitute of wealth and council, to its utter impoverishment and destruction. The crown of England, which had been always free and inde∣pendent of every earthly sovereign, would be made subject to the pope, and the statutes of the realm rendered of no effect; to the disgrace of the king, his crown and royalty, and the ruin of the whole kingdom. They declared they would stand by him with their lives and fortunes against all processes in the court of Rome, about rights of patronage, bulls, and mandates, and all at∣tempts against his crown and royalty. All the lords spiritual and temporal made the same declaration, though the prelates entered a protest that they did not intend to deny the pope's canonical authority; and the famous Statute of Premunire was passed against all that purchased or sollicited, in the court of Rome, or elsewhere, any translations of bishops, processes and sentences of excommunication, bulls, instruments, or any thing else to the prejudice of the king, his crown, regality, or kingdom. This statute and declaration had such effect, that, during the remaining part of Richard's reign very few<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Rot. Parl. Claus. 18. Rich.

<P>After the parliament broke up, the king appointed the duke of Lancaster his lieutenant in Picardy; and granted a commission, impowering that nobleman and his brother the duke of Gloucester to treat with the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, about the prolongation of the truce. The conferences were held at Lenlinghen, between Calais and Boulogne, and continued nine days, during which the truce was prolonged till Michaelmas of the ensuing year; but the former difficulties touching a final peace recurred, and they were obliged to suspend their negotiation until they should have received fur∣ther instructions. Both courts were tired of the war, and sincerely disposed to∣wards an accommodation; therefore the treaty was renewed, and some pro∣gress made towards a pacification. The French consented to restore Bigorre, the Agenois, and Perigort; but would not cede Rouvergne, Quercy, the Li∣mousin, Ponthieu, or any part of Guisnes but what was actually possessed by the English. Richard's plenipotentiaries would not suffer Calais to be men∣tioned; but with respect to Cherbourg and Brest, a proposal was made, that the king of France should pay a certain sum of money to Richard for the res∣titution of these places to the king of Navarre and the duke of Brittany. All the articles were well nigh adjusted, when Charles, who resided at Abbeville, being seized with a return of his frenzy, the conferences were suddenly sus∣pended: but they were renewed in September, by which time he had retrieved the use of his reflection; and, the affair of Cherbourg being settled, orders<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> were given for surrendering it immediately to the king of Navarre.</P>

in the name of the commons, that they would decline giving their ad∣vice touching the treaty of peace, unless these preliminaries should be settled. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s declaration produced a debate <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mong the lords; and some bitter alterca∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on passed between the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of Lancaster and the earl of Arundel, who, as rivals in power and influence, had long <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> each other in secret. During the duke's ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence in Picardy, the people of Cheshire and Lancashire, who lived under the government of the king's two uncles, raised an insurrection against their officers; and being headed by Sir Thomas Talbot, threatened to destroy all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s belonging to the duke of Lancaster, who returning suddenly to England, to q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell this disturbance, understood that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of Arundel had remained in the neighbourhood at his castle of Holt, without taking any step to disp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse the insurgents. Incensed at his indifference, he accused the earl of having conn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved at the violences they committed; but he justified himself in such a manner as convinced even the duke of his innocence. He resolved however to be revenged upon his accuser for this insult offered to his honour, and impeached the duke, in his turn, for being too familiar with the king, whom he had obliged to wear his colour and livery; for intimidating the mem∣bers of the council, so as that they could not speak their sentiments freely; for having obtained an illegal grant of Guienne, and an exorbitant sum of money for his expedition into Spain; and for misconduct in the management of the late treaty. The king, who detested Arundel, made himself a party in this quarrel: he told the house the whole was false and frivolous; that he admitted the duke to no familiarity, but what was consistent with the consanguinity and affection subsisting between them; that he wore his uncle's colour as a mark of that affection; that the grant of Guienne was made with the consent of par∣liament, which had likewise gratified him with part of the money expended in the Spanish expedition; that the after-payment was less than he deserved, con∣sidering the relief of Brest and other services; and that his conduct in ma∣naging the treaty was warranted by the instructions he had received from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing and council. After this declaration of the sovereign, the parliament could not decently avoid passing a vote, acquitting the duke of the imputations laid to his charge; and the earl of Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndel was obliged to ask his pardon in<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll parliament. Then the dukes of Lancaster and Gloucester, as count pa∣latine of Lancaster and lord chief justice of Chester, petitioned the king and lords <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or judgment against Sir Thomas Talbot and others, for having engaged in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to take away their lives, and raised forces for that purpose. The king, with the concurrence of the lords, declared the offence to be high treason, and ordered Talbot to be apprehended and brought to trial. If not found by the sher<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f, it was resolved that he should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmoned to appear at next Easter term, in the court of king's bench, on pain of being deemed convicted of treason, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure of his lands and chattels; and that all who h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him should be subjected to the same penalty.

<P>While John duke of Lancaster was employed in this negotiation, his own wife Constance of Castile died in England; and her death was fol∣lowed by that of his daughter-in-law the countess of Derby. These ladies were not long survived by the queen, who was regretted by the whole nation, as a good-natured, sensible, compassionate princess: from the meekness of her disposition, she had acquired the epithet of The Good Queen Anne; and her death made such a deep impression upon the mind of Richard, that he was for some time disconsolate, and never could bear the sight of the palace at Sheen, where she expired. This melancholy event confirmed him in his resolution<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham.</NOTE> of crossing the sea to Ireland, where the English interest was by this time in a very declining situation. The English noblemen, who possessed large estates in that country, chose to fix their residence in England, so that Ireland was left almost altogether defenceless, and exposed to the efforts of the old Irish septs, who did not neglect this opportunity to recover their antient possessions. These they retook by force of arms, and plundered all the rest of the country which belonged to the E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glish; insomuch that, whereas Edward III. had drawn a considerable revenue from that kingdom, Richard, far from reaping any such advantage from it, was obliged to expend thirty thousand marks yearly, for the preservation of what little still remained under his dominion. In August, a proclamation was issued, commanding all the absent proprietors to repair to Ireland by the eighth day of September, and wait the king's ar∣rival. The military tenants of the crown were summoned; the Cinque-Ports required to furnish their armament of fifty-seven ships, well manned: and, as the duke of Lancaster had resolved to set out for Guienne, his brother the duke of York was appointed guardian of England during the king's absence. The forces being assembled, and the navy equipped, Richard set out for Wales, accompanied by the duke of Gloucester, the earls of Marche, Not∣tingham, and Rutland; and, embarking about Michaelmas at Milford-Haven, landed in Ireland, with an army of thirty thousand men. The native Irish, intimidated by such a powerful armament, either retired to their fastnesses, or made their submission; and Richard treated them with great clemency. He not only pardoned those who submitted, but even allotted pensions to their chiefs; and endeavoured to reclaim them from their native barbarity. The earl of Nottingham was empowered to receive, in the king's name, the submission and homage of all the Irish in Leinster; and they gave bonds for their peaceable behaviour. O Neal, who pretended to be lord paramount over the other princes of Ireland, made a voluntary tender of allegiance to Richard, and did homage to him at Drogheda; though he still reserved to himself a kind of sovereign power, which the king did not think it worth his while to dispute. His example was followed by O Hanlon, O Donnel, Mac Mahon, and other toparchs, who engaged for themselves and their whole clans, that they should not disturb the peace of the kingdom. Richard in∣vited all the chiefs to an entertainment at Dublin, during the Christmas fes∣tival; and not only entertained them with royal munificence, but also con∣ferred upon them the order of knighthood; and encouraged them to adapt the English customs, habit, and way of living. He afterwards summoned a par∣liament in the same city, with a view to redress their grievances; with respect to which they obtained full satisfaction in the punishment and removal of
<PB N="186" REF="1880"/>
those officers by whom they had been injured and oppressed: in a word, he behaved with such lenity and prudence as acquired the affection and e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teem of the native Irish, the greater part of whom quietly submitted to his dominion.</P>

While he was thus laudably employed in Ireland, the guardian convoked a parliament at Westminster, in the month of January; and the duke of Gloucester was sent over to manage the interest of the crown in this assembly, which being made acquainted with the king's proceedings in Ire∣land, approved of his conduct, and granted a subsidy to enable him to finish the reduction of that country. A nuncio from the pope attended at this ses∣sion to sollicit a repeal of the statute against provisors; but all his sollicitations proved ineffectual. A remonstrance was also presented by the Wickliffites, who had by this time acquired the appellation of Lollards, and were become so numerous and confident, as to preach, write, and declaim openly against the established religion. Under the protection of some powerful noblemen, they publicly impeached the morals and doctrines of the clergy; they fixed l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bels on the doors of churches; and a writing, containing the articles of their charge, was now brought into parliament, by Sir Thomas Latimer, Sir Richard Story, and other members, who had adopted their persuasion. The archbishop of York and the bishop of London, alarmed at this bold attack, made a voyage to Dublin, where they represented those Lollards as enemies both to church and state; they practised so effectually on the weak mind and jealous disposition of Richard, that he abandoned the fair prospect of reducing Ireland, and returned to England, with a view to crush those dangerous in∣novators. When he arrived, they were threatened with death if they should persist in their errors; and the chancellor of Oxford was ordered to expel all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>This affair being settled, the attention of the king and council was employed upon an object of as great importance to the peace of the na∣tion. The queen having died without issue, those who sincerely wished well to their country began to be uneasy about the succession: for though Richard, before his departure on the Irish expedition, is said to have declared Edmund Mortimer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was the only son of Roger Mortimer, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Mortimer earl of Marche, who married Philippa, sole daughter of Lionel duke of Cla∣rence, third son of Edward III.</NOTE>, son of Roger earl of Marche, presumptive heir of the crown; had the king died without legitimate offspring, the kingdom would, in all probability, have been embroiled by the ambition of the dukes of Lancaster and Gloucester. In order to prevent such civil dissensions, Richard was ad∣vised to engage in a second marriage; and the council casting their eyes upon Isabel, eldest daughter of the French king, as a suitable consort for the Eng∣lish monarch, the archbishop of Dublin, the bishop of St. David's, the earls of Rutland and Nottingham, the lord Beaumont, and William Le Scroop, chamberlain of the houshold, were sent ambassadors to the court of France, to demand that princess in marriage for Richard: they were instructed to insist upon a considerable portion, and empowered to offer ten thousand marks a year for her jointure; and after this match should have been transacted, the other part of their commission was to effect a marriage between Isabel's younger

<P>The next affair that fell under the consideration of the council, was a dispute between the duke of Lancaster and the natives of Guienne, from whom he had not met with that reception which was due to a sovereign. The prelates, nobility, and cities had engaged in an association to treat him with deference and civility, as the brother of the Black Prince, and the uncle of king Richard; but without doing homage to him as their sovereign. He ex∣erted all his artifice to prevail upon them to acknowledge his authority, in obedience to the patent of king Richard, and the sanction of the English par∣liament. He endeavoured to cajole them with promises of a mild administra∣tion, and other particular advantages; he overwhelmed the individuals with civility, and even tempted them with valuable presents. But they were proof against all his efforts; and, as he had not strength sufficient to compel them to a submission, the dispute was referred to the decision of the king and council. The cities of Bourdeaux and Bayonne sent over deputies to sollicit a repeal of the grant; and the duke employed John de Greilly, natural son of the famous Captal de Buche, as his agent at the court of England. Both parties were heard in a great council of the prelates and nobility, convoked at Sheen for that purpose. The official of Bourdeaux explained the privileges of the Gascons, with which this grant was incompatible; and represented, with such energy, the mischiefs that would accrue from it to the crown of England, that the hearers were convinced of the truth of what he alledged, and gene∣rally disposed to comply with the desire of his constituents. But the duke of Gloucester, who looked upon the presence of his brother as a check upon his own ambition, was very desirous of his being detained at a distance from England; and therefore opposed the remonstrance of the official with all his influence. He was seconded by his nephew the earl of Derby, who naturally espoused his father's cause; but, perceiving the other members were of a dif∣ferent opinion, he withdrew abruptly, on the supposition that they would not take any resolution in his absence. In this hope, however, he was disap∣pointed; for, after he had retired, they spoke their sentiments with more free∣dom, and the king concurring with them in their deliberations, it was unani∣mously resolved, that the duke of Lancaster should be recalled. Richard accordingly sent for him to England, where he arrived in the beginning of the next year, and resigned his grant of Guienne into the hands of his majesty.</P>

<P>Mean while the English ambassadors, arriving at Paris, ex∣plained the nature of their embassy; and Richard's proposal was debated in the French council. Some of the members suggested, that there was something inconsistent and unnatural in the proposition of such a marriage, before peace was concluded between the two nations; but the duke of Burgundy was well affected to the scheme, which he observed was the most likely expedie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to effect and consolidate an accommodation. Through his influence, the am∣bassadors met with a favourable reception from the ministry; and though the alliance was strongly opposed by the dukes of Berry and Orleans, the king himself favoured the proposal, which was accepted accordingly. A treaty was immediately set on foot, and the articles being discussed by the plenipo∣tentiaries,

These points being ratified, the young princess, though still a child, was intitled queen of England, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>anced by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ingham as Richard's proxy. Richard resolved to make a voyage to France, and wed the princess in person; and, for that purpose, the greatest part of the summer was employed in making prepara∣tions for the ceremony. His marriage was not the only pretence he used for crossing the channel. He expre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed a desire of examining, repairing, and im∣provi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cations of Calais: but the real motive of his voyage was to concert measures with the French court, for surmounting all opposition in England; and particularly for humbling the duke of Gloucester, whose pride and ambition were equally di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>greeable and dangerous to Richard, and who had, from the beginning of this negotiation, violently opposed the measure. Such was his popularity in the nation, and influence in the council, that the king would not v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nture to conclude the treaty without his concurrence; and signified to the French court, that he was inaccessible on every side, except that of av<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice. When he attended Richard to France, the ministry of that kingdom care<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed him with extraordinary civilities, and even tempted him with some valuable presents: but he saw through all this complai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance, for which he despised them in his heart; and treated their advances with such contempt, that the duke of Burgundy declared the match should not have been concluded, but for the deference he payed to the personal character of the English monarch. Gloucester's aversion to this alliance proceeded partly from his own disappointed ambition, and partly from a regard to the interest of his country. He had proposed a marri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge between Richard and his own daughter, which the king waved on pretence of consanguinity. He found that the rendition of Brest was one article of the treaty; and he dreaded the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate of Calais: yet these considerations gave way to what he conceived to be his own immediate interest. Richard, who was well acquainted with his dis∣pos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion, promised to gratify him with a p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esent of fifty thousand nobles on their return to England, and to bestow upon his son the earldom of Ro∣chester, with an estate of two thousand pounds a year to maintain that dignity.

<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own and castle of Brest had been conditionally put into the hands of the English, by the duke of Brittany, to be re-delivered whenever a long truce or treaty with France should be concluded: and now he claimed the requisition of Richard, who gave orders for its being surrendered accord∣ingly. This step, which he could not have avoided with any regard to good faith and equity, was extremely unpopular in England; and Gloucester, by this time, finding himself the dupe of Richard, who had amused him with promises he never intended to perform, made it an handle for the gratification of his resentment, if not to pave the way <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or his own ambitious designs.

His resentment was the more dangerous to Richard, as he had now no rival in the council; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or his brother the duke of Lancaster, who, since his last arrival in England, counterballanced his influence, had lately lost all his credit with the council, and the nation in general, by marrying Catherine Swinford, an obscure foreigner, educated in the court of queen Philippa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who had been retained as governess to the duke's daughters by his first con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, and bore to him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our ill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gitimate children: these were John, Henry, Thomas, and Jane, married first to Robert lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Ferrers, and afterwards to Ralph Nevil earl of Westmoreland.

<P>During this temporary eclipse of Lancaster, his brother Gloucester triumphed in his popularity, and exerted all his endeavours in preparing for a vigorous opposition in the ensuing parliament.

The king, conscious of his own strength, resented this as an insult upon his dignity, and sent a message to the commons, importing that the bill contained certain articles intrenching upon his honour and prerogative, which he was resolved to maintain against all encroachment; he therefore insisted upon their delivering the bill to the lords, together with the name of the member who had presumed to bring it into the house.

They pro∣tested they had no intention to encroach upon his royal estate and liberty, es∣pecially with regard to his person, and the oeconomy of his houshold; that they had no other design, but that of prevailing upon the lords to advise him to consult the honour of his state in all his transactions, according to his own good pleasure; they therefore submitted themselves to his will and favour, and begged <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would graciously excuse the freedom they had taken, pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essing themselves always ready to support his royal estate and dignity, and to perform in body and goods like loyal subjects, whatever should be for his honour and safety. Notwithstanding this piteous address, Richard insisted upon Haxey's being brought to trial before the lords, who condemned him to suffer death as a traitor. The sentence was no sooner known, than the archbishop of Canter∣bury,
<PB N="191" REF="1930"/>
at the head of the prelates, presented himself before the king, and de∣claring that it ever was and should be their full resolution to maintain his royal estate and dignity without diminution, besought his majesty to spare the life of Haxey, and order him to be delivered into their custody, out of his special grace and favour. The king complied with this their humble request, and or∣dered the criminal to be delivered to the archbishop. The subsidy upon wool being continued, the king confirmed the dignity of earl mareschal to Thomas de Mowbray, and the heirs male of his body. John de Beaufort, natural son of Lancaster by Catherine Swinford, was created earl of Somerset; and Sir Robert Belknap, Sir John Holt, and Sir William Burgh, three of the judges who had been banished to Ireland for the opinions at Nottingham, were, by the assent of the lords and commons, allowed to return from exile. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>After the parliament broke up, the duke of Gloucester and his associates prosecuted their intrigues with great success, in alienating the affec∣tions of the people from Richard: nor did they make any secret of their dis∣content; they and their partisans publicly declared that Richard was not fit to govern; that the spirit of the nation was quite broken, by his mismanagement and pusillanimity; and that he ought to be immured for life, and pass his days in that indolence which had disgraced his administration. These proceedings were reported to the king with such exaggerations as alarmed that weak prince, who believed or seemed to believe that his life was not secure from their machi∣nations. His uterine brother John Holland earl of Huntingdon, who had been governor of Brest, employed emissaries to watch the conduct of the associates. He was a man of profligate morals, and a professed enemy of Gloucester, whose ruin he sought with the most eager industry; he therefore represented every thing against that nobleman in the most unfavourable light, to arouse his appre∣hension and inflame his resentment. These circumstances of intelligence Ri∣chard communicated to the dukes of Lancaster and York, who endeavoured to remove the jealousies subsisting between the king and their brother, by employ∣ing friendly remonstrances with both. Gloucester still professed the utmost ve∣neration for the king's person, but insisted upon a change of measures. Ri∣chard attempted to engage his other two uncles, in a violent prosecution against Gloucester: but they refused to be concerned in any scheme against the life of their own brother; and retired to their houses in the country, in order to avoid censure and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>picion. Their example was followed by Sir Thomas Piercy brother to the earl of Northumberland, who resigned his office of steward of the houshold, and withdrew from a court which was altogether abandoned to riot and indiscretion. Richard was now left entirely to the management of raw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unsteady, hot-headed counsellors, who persuaded him that there was no other way to prevent his own ruin, but that of effecting the speedy destruction of Gloucester; and this advice was seconded by the count of St. Pol, a French nobleman, who came over to visit the young queen of England. The duke was too powerful to be apprehended openly, and punished according to the forms of justice. All the people in the neighbourhood of Pleshy, where he l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved, would have taken arms to defend him from violence; and Richard justly supposed that his two brothers would not tamely behold him sacrificed to sus∣picion or convenience: he therefore resolved to use a more effectual expedient, and take him off by private treachery. As he had always maintained the ap∣pearance
<PB N="192" REF="1940"/>
of affection and familiarity with his uncle Gloucester, he made a pre∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hunting in E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ex; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning visited the duke at Pleshy, where he was received with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cordial hospitality, both by his uncle and the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tchess. While they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upper, he told the duke that he wanted to consult him on some very important affair relating to the state, and desired he would accompany him to Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don, where a council should be called in the morning. The unsuspecting duke chearfully complied with his desire, and set out with the king on horseback, attended by four or five domestics. As th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y approached Epping Forest Richard rode off at full gallop; and Gloucester was immediately surrounded by armed men, who conveyed him to the river, and put him on board of a ship which weighed anchor immediately, and arrived next day at Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ais. The duke's associates the earls of Arundel, Warwick, lord Cobham, Sir John Cheney, and other persons of distinction who had also been invited to the council, were next day arrested at London. Lest the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e proceedings should create some disturbance among the people, a proclamation was issued, declaring that the lords were arrested upon fresh matter of treason laid to their charge: and that they should be tried by a great co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncil of their peers, which was summoned to meet on the first day of August at Nottingham. There they accordingly met at the time appointed; when an appeal for treason was brought against the duke of Gloucester, and the earls of Arundel and Warwick, by the earls of Rutland, Kent, Huntingdon, Nottingham, Somerset, Salisbury, the lord Spenser, and Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iam Scroop chamberlain of the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: the bill being read and considered, the appealed lords were indulged with time till the four∣teenth day of September, to prepare answers to the articles of their impeach∣ment in parliament. But it was not Richard's intention to allow Gloucester the privilege of a trial. He had sent Sir William Rickhill, one of the justices of the common pleas, with a commission to examine the duke at Calais, hoping that this artful l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wyer wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld have extracted a confession of trea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onable practices from the duke, by tampe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing with the heat and impatience of his temper. But as he acknowledged nothing that amounted to treason, Richard ordered the e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rl of Nottingham, who was governor of Calais, to give directions for his be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng privately murdered. These directions were executed by four assassins ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed Hall, Loveto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Serle, and Frances, who conveyed the duke from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Calais to a public i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, where he was informed of his destiny, in which he acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sced without emotion, and was smothered between two sea∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er-beds on a pallet: then they stripped the body, and laying it under the bed cloaths, pretended that he died in the night of an apoplexy. Thus died Tho∣mas Wodestoke duke of Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cester, who possessed many virtues with an alloy or weakness and human infirmity, to which he fell a sac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifice.

they found themselves anticipated by the vigilance and foresight of R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣chard and his counsellors, who had reinforced his guards with ten thousand archers; and expended the sums of money which he had received by loan and subsidy, in securing a majority in the ensuing parliament. Knowing that the duke of York implicitly followed the advice of Lancaster, and that this last was open to flattery and ambition, he employed his favourite Rutland to dissuade his uncles from all opposition; and that young nobleman succeeded in his negotiation. He expatiated upon the calamities of civil war; insinuated that Richard would be obliged to have recourse to the assistance of his father-in-law the French king, who might, on pretence of supporting him, enslave the country: he ob∣served that though Gloucester's fate was l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mentable, it could not now be re∣called; assured them that the king remembred it with unfeigned sorrow and contrition; and finally promised, in his majesty's name, that if they would lay aside all schemes of resentment, and consent to an hearty reconciliation with the king, they should preside in his councils, and wholly direct him in all his fu∣ture conduct. The dukes yielded to this remonstrance, dismissed their adhe∣rents, and all disputes between the king and them were for the present com∣promised.</P>

<P>The parliament meeting at Westminster in the middle of Sep∣tember, Sir John Bushy, a creature of the court, was, at the king's recom∣mendation, chosen speaker, after he, with Sir William Bagot and Sir Henry Green, had undertaken to manage all the prosecutions which had been pre∣viously planned against the lords of the opposition. The session began with the consideration of a bill, enacting that holy church, the lords spiritual and tem∣poral, all cities, boroughs, and commonalities of the realm, should enjoy their liberties and franchises as they had been enjoyed under his majesty's noble pro∣genitors kings of England. This law being passed, the commons moved that whereas several judgments had been reversed, because the clergy had not assisted at the trial, they should now appoint a general proctor, impowered to act for them in their absence: Sir Thomas Piercy was accordingly appointed for this purpose, by the two archbishops and their clergy. Then the commission and statute made in the eleventh year of this reign was repealed, as being traiter∣ously obtained by constraint and compulsion, against the king's will, and to the prejudice of his crown and dignity. It was ordained that no such commission should take place for the future; and that all persons endeavouring to procure any such instrument, should suffer as traitors: the pardons granted to the duke of Gloucester, the earls of Arundel and Warwick, in the eleventh year of the king's reign, as well as that afterwards passed in favour of Arundel at Windsor, in the seventeenth year of his majesty's reign, were revoked and annulled, as having been obtained by compulsion. After these preliminary resolutions, the commons protested to the king in full parliament, that it was their intention, with his majesty's leave, to impeach any person or persons as often as they should think proper, during the session of this parliament; and their protest was accepted and enrolled. This step being taken, they impeached Thomas Arun∣del archbishop of Canterbury of high treason; for having been aiding, pro∣curing, and advising, in making a commission directed to Thomas duke of Gloucester, Richard earl of Arundel, and others, in the tenth year of his ma∣jesty's reign; which commission was made in prejudice of the king, his crown,
<PB N="194" REF="1960"/>
and dignity. He was likewise accused of having advised the duke of Glou∣cester and the earls of Arundel and Warwick to assume the royal power, and arrest the king's lieges Simon Burley and James Berners, whom they adjudged to death, contrary to the will of his majesty. The commons petitioned that the king would order the said Thomas to be put in safe custody; and the king replied, that as the impeachment affected a peer of the realm, he would avise with his council on the subject. They afterwards dem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded judgment against the archbishop, who acknowledged in the king's presence that he had been mis∣taken, and erred in his conduct relating to that commission; and therefore sub∣mitted to his majesty's mercy. He was declared a traitor, and condemned to perpetual banishment; his temporalities were seized, his goods and chattels for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eited, and he himself was ordered to quit the kingdom in six weeks after the sentence was pronounced. This prelate had been cajoled by the king, who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> assured him in private, that if he would confess the charge and make no defence in parliament, he should have his majesty's pardon, and nothing would be done to his prejudice. But after he was condemned unheard in his absence, the king, far from performing his promise, sollicited and obtained his deprivation from the pope, who, at Richard's desire, nominated Roger Walden the king's treasurer, to fill up the vacant bishoprick.</P>

<P>The archbishop's trial being finished, the lords appellants exhibit∣ed their bill of impeachment against the duke of Gloucester, the earls of Arun∣del and Warwick, and Thomas Mortimer, accusing them of having procured the aforesaid commission; of having taken up arms against his majecty; of having effected the death and imprisonment of several li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge subjects; and of hav∣ing conspired to depose the king, who in all probability would have fallen a sacrifice to their treason, had not they been restrained from executing their scheme, by the remonstrances of Henry of Lancaster earl of Derby, and Tho∣mas Mowbray earl of Nottingham. The duke of Lancaster being appointed lord high steward, the earl of Arundel was brought to his trial; and the appeal being read in his hearing, he pleaded his general pardon granted by the king and confirmed by the parliament. But this having been already repealed in the present session, he was found guilty of high treason, condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, and all his estate real and personal was forfeited to the king's use; yet the sentence was mitigated into simple decapitation. The duke of Gloucester, though dead, was declared a traitor to his king and coun∣try, his estate forfeited, and his bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od attainted. Then the appellants peti∣tioned that his confession might be road in full parliament; and Sir William Rickhill produced a paper signed by the duke's own hand, in which he acknow∣ledged that he had been guilty of divers indiscreet actions, and offered several insults to his majesty, whom he had also slandered in the heat and precipitation of his passion; but at the same time he declared upon his soul, that he had never entertained one thought to the prejudice of his royal dignity. Thomas earl of Warwick being brought by the constable of the Tower into parliament, was by the steward made acquainted with the nature of the appeal which had been lodged against him; and he pleading guilty and throwing himself on the king's mercy, was subjected to the same sentence which had been pronounced against the earl of Arundel; but the king changed the punishment into perpetual exile and confinement in the Isle of Man; with this proviso, that if any means should
<PB N="195" REF="1970"/>
be used for his escape, the sentence of the lord steward should be executed with∣out any further examination. Thomas Mortimer having fled into Ireland, and taken refuge in the mountains among the rebellious natives, a proclamation was issued through that kingdom, requiring him to appear within three months, and answer to the impeachment; otherwise he was declared a traitor, and all his estate forfeited.</P>

<P>After these severe pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>criptions, which reflected disgrace upon the whole parliament, and particularly upon the dukes of Lancaster and York, and the earl of Derby, who acted so officiously against their nearest relations and for∣mer confederates, the commons interceded with the king in behalf of the lords and bishops, who had been named in the commission passed in the tenth year of his reign, without procuring or acting in the execution thereof. These were the duke of York, the bishop of Winchester, and Sir Richard Le Scroope, whose loyalty and innocence were now acknowledged by a statute enacted in full par∣liament. The commons likewise besought his majesty, that he would consider the services of Henry of Lancaster earl of Derby, and Thomas de Mowbray earl of Nottingham, who had expresly hindered the rebellious lords from seiz∣ing the person of the king, renounced their society, and given intimation of their traitorous intent. The commons recommended these noblemen in a spe∣cial manner to his majesty's favour, and requested that he would publicly de∣clare in parliament their good fame and loyal behaviour. Richard, sitting upon his throne, complied with their desire, declaring that to his own knowledge, the earls of Derby and Nottingham were good and faithful subjects; and it was voted that this declaration should have the force of a statute. All these transactions were closed with some acts of the king's munificence, calculated to attach certain noblemen the more strongly to his interest. The earl of Derby was created duke of Hereford, the earl of Rutland made duke of Albemar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; Thomas Holland earl of Kent was promoted to the dukedom of Surrey; his brother John earl of Huntingdon to that of Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter; and Thomas Mowbray earl of Nottingham was declared duke of Norfolk. The earldom of Somer∣set and marquisate of Dorset were conferred upon John Beaufort; Thomas lord Spenser was created earl of Gloucester, Ralph Nevil earl of Westmoreland, Thomas Piercy earl of Worcester, and William Le Scroope earl of Wiltshire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl. Tyrrel.</NOTE> These promotions being made, the parliament was adjourned to the twenty∣seventh day of January, when it was required to meet at Shrewsbury: but be∣fore the members withdrew from London, the lords spiritual and temporal, to∣gether with the knights of shires, swore solemnly before the shrine of St. Ed∣ward in Westminster Abbey, that they would maintain all the statutes, establishments, ordinances, and judgments, enacted and given in this parlia∣ment, without suffering them to be revoked, reversed, or annulled, saving to the king his right and royalty. Then the king, accompanied by the lords spi∣ritual and temporal, proceeded to the high altar, where the prelates and ordi∣naries of the provinces of Canterbury and York, pronounced the sentence of the greater excommunication against all who should openly or privately, by deed or counsel, contravene or oppose the statutes and regulations which the parliament had enacted and sworn to maintain, saving still the king's royalty and prerogative.</P>

Whether Richard felt remorse for having taken away the life of Arundel, or those reports touching his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anctity made an impression upon his fancy, the apparition of that nobleman haunted his imagination, inso∣much that he could not for some time enjoy his natural repose, but started from his slumber with horror and affright.

The questions and answers there made, being now read p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>blicly before the estates of parliament, they unanimous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y declared that the said answers were good and lawful; and all the judges protested, that had the same questions been submitted to their consideration, they would have an∣swer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them to the same effect.

<PB N="197" REF="1990"/>
king, in the name of the commons, that the ordinances and judgments of this might be established with all possibe security. Richard advised with the lords spiritual and temporal, as well as with the justices and lawyers, on the subject of this petition; and they unanimously declared there could be no greater s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cu∣rity than the authority of parliament, which, however was reinforced by a re∣newal of the oath taken by the lords and commons, to supp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt and maintain the proceedings of the session. Those affairs of importance being dispatched, Tho∣mas le D'Espenser petitioned that the sentence of exile and disherison, pro∣nounced against his grandfather and great grandfather, which had been re∣pealed in the fifteenth year of the reign of Edward II. and afterwards renewed under Edward III. should now be repealed a second time, for the causes specified in the former repeal. The sentence was accordingly once more reversed; though in the succeeding reign of Henry IV. this favour was again annulled. The parliaments had made a practice, during the reigns of weak princes, of reversing the decrees of each other, according to the prevalency of interest in the court or opposition. On the last day of the session, the duke of Here<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord falling on his knees before the king, acknowledged that he had been concerned in many disturbances and meetings, contrary to the peace of the kingdom and his majesty's royalty, though not with any intention to injure his sovereign; but as he now understood they were offences, he begged pardon with great hu∣mility, and hoped he should obtain his majesty's forgiveness. Richard gra∣ciously accepted of his acknowledgment, pardoned him in full parliament for any offence he might have committed, and promised him his particular favour and protection. Then the parliament granted a more ample subsidy than had ever been given to his grandfather, desiring he would be pleased to bestow a certain sum of money upon those who had been plundered at Radcot-Bridge, and defray the expences of the lords appellants. A general pardon was granted for past offences in favour of all the king's subjects; though with a clause which excluded from the benefit of this amnesty fifty persons, whose names were not expressed, but reserved to the particular knowledge and pleasure of the king, who might nominate them occasionally: so that no man in England could ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re himself that he was not excepted.

<P>The first object that fell under the consideration of the com∣mittee was a charge exhibited against the duke of Norfolk by Henry duke of Hereford, who taxed him with having spoken seditious words against his ma∣jesty, in a privat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conversation between Brentford and London. A paper, con∣taining the substance of this conversation, being read before the king and the lords in parliament, it was referred to the committee; and after much debate and examination of the accused, who denied the charge, the king and the said committee decreed, that, for want of sufficient proof the dispute should be de∣cided by single combat, according to the laws of chivalry. The twenty-ninth day of April was fixed for the duel, and the lists were appointed at Coventry, to which place the king repaired, accompanied by all his peers, and created the duke of Albemarle high constable, and the duke of Surrey lord mareschal for the occasion. Hereford the challenger first appeared on a white courser gayly caparisoned, and armed cap-a-pee, with his drawn sword in his hand. When he approached the lists, the mareschal demanded who he was; and he answered, "I am Henry of Lancaster duke of Hereford, come hither accord∣ing to my duty against Thomas Mowbray duke of Norfolk, a false traitor to God, the king, the realm, and me." Then taking the oath that his quarrel was just and true, he desired to enter the lists, which being granted, he sheathed his sword, pulled down his beaver, crossed himself on the forehead, seized his lance, passed the barrier, alighted, and sat down, in a chair of green velvet placed at one end of the lists. He had scarce taken his seat, when the king came into the field with great pomp, attended by the peers, the count of St. Pol, who came from France on purpose to see this famous trial, and ten thousand men at arms to prevent tumults and disturbance. His ma∣jesty, being seated in his chair of state, the king at arms proclaimed, that none but such as were appointed to marshal the field, should presume to touch the li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts on pain of death. Then another herald pronounced aloud, "Behold here Henry of Lancaster duke of Hereford, who has entered the lists to per∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm his devoir, against Thomas Mowbray duke of Norfolk, on pain of be∣ing counted false and recreant." The duke of Norfolk immediately appeared in arms, mounted upon a barbed horse, with a coat of arms of crimson velvet embroidered with lions of silver and mulberry trees; and, having taken his oath before the constable and mareschal, entered the field, exclaiming aloud, "God de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end the right." Alighting from his horse, he placed himself in a chair of crimson velvet, opposite to his antagonist, at the other end of the lists. Then the mareschal, having measured their lances, delivered one to the challenger, and sent a knight with the other to the duke of Norfolk, and pro∣clamation was made that they should prepare for the combat. They imme∣diately mounted their horses, closed their beavers, fixed their lances in the rests, and, the trumpets sounding a charge, the duke of Hereford began his career with great violence; but, before he could join his antagonist, the king threw down his warder, and the heralds interposed. Richard ordered their lances to be taken away, and they returned to their chairs, while the king re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired to council, where their doom was determined without bloodshed. Sir John Bouray returned to the field at the king's command; and, silence being enjoined by proclamation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pronounced their sentence to this effect: That forasmuch as the appellant and defendant had honourably appeared in the
<PB N="199" REF="2010"/>
lists, ready and even forward to engage in single combat, their courage was sufficiently ascertained; and the king, in order to prevent the effusion of chris∣tian blood, had decreed, with the advice of his council and committee of par∣liament, that Henry duke of Hereford should within fifteen days depart the kingdom, and go into exile for the space of ten years, on pain of death; that the duke of Norfolk should be banished for life, because he had not been able to clear himself of the imputation of having spoken seditious words against his majesty; and that all his revenues should be sequestred, until the king should be reimbursed in all the sums which Mowbray had embezzled, on pretence of paying the garrison of Calais. Then proclamation was made, that no person should presume to intercede with the king in behalf of each party, on pain of incurring his majesty's displeasure; and the dukes were obliged to promise upon oath, that they would never meet willingly, nor maintain the least intercourse in foreign countries, nor carry on any sort of correspondence<NOTE PLACE="marg">Placit.

<P>Nothing can be a stronger proof of the arbitrary disposition of the king and his committee than this sentence, by which the duke of Here∣ford was driven into exile without having been charged with any offence, and perpetual banishment inflicted upon Thomas Mowbray, who had appealed to the only trial by which his innocence could be manifested, if not sufficiently ascertained by his accuser's failing to convict him by legal evidence. There was something mean and perfidious in Hereford's betraying the particulars of a private conversation, which appears to have contained nothing dangerous to the state or the sovereign. He in all probability considered Mowbray as his rival in interest, consequently a troublesome bar to the execution of that scheme he had projected; and perhaps he longed for an opportunity to revenge the murder of his uncle Gloucester, in which the duke of Norfolk was prin∣cipally concerned. Richard dreaded both equally, as noblemen of dangerous power and ambition, and was glad of a pretence for expelling Mowbray from the kingdom; but that he should venture to banish Hereford, without any cause assigned, is a very extraordinary circumstance; and that his own father the duke of Lancaster should tamely acquiesce in the sentence, is still more surprising. By this time, the spirit of that nobleman seems to have been evaporated with the vigour of his youth; for he complied with every measure the king proposed, and suffered himself to be made a tool, for effecting the ruin of his own family. The duke of Norfolk was overwhelmed with grief and despondence at the judgment which was awarded against him. He re∣tired to Germany, from whence he repaired to Venice, where in a little time he died of sorrow and chagrin. Hereford on the contrary bore his fate with great resignation, and behaved with such respectful submission, when he went to take his leave of the king at Eltham, that Richard, pleased with his deportment, re∣mitted four years of his exile. He withdrew to Paris, where he met with a favourable reception from the French king, and in all probability would have married the only daughter of the duke of Berry, had not the match been de∣feated by the interposition of Richard, who sent the earl of Salisbury as his ambassador to represent Hereford as a person who had been guilty of treason∣able practices; and to assure the French court that he would never be permitted to return to his own country. The princes of the blood, alarmed at this de∣claration,

<P>This transaction was so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>njust and arbitrary, that Richard must have laid aside all intention to keep measures with his people, and laid his account with being exposed to the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entment of Here<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore he ven∣tured to give it the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anction of his authority. By the death of his uncle, he thought himself freed from all restraint: he plunged <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto all manner of effeminate debauchery and profligate profusion, and took the most unjusti∣fiable methods to raise money <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the support of his extravagance. Over and above the great subsidies, granted by a corrupt parliament, he extorted loans under the name of Benevolence; he trumped up a charge of high treason against seventeen counties for having sided with the duke of Gloucester and the lords of the opposition; and, notwithstanding the pardon which had been confirmed in parliament, threatened to spoil and destroy them as public enemies, unless they would submit wholly to his pleasure; so that the inhabitants were obliged to redeem their lives and estates with exorbitant sums of money, by the payment of which they were utterly impoverished. He imposed new oaths upon the sheriffs of counties, by which they bound themselves to obey him in all his arbitrary and illegal commands: the garrisons abroad were neglected:
<PB N="201" REF="2030"/>
the northern counties ruined by the incursions of the Scots, whom he had not spirit enough to repel: the native Irish made great progress in wresting their antient possessions from the hands of the English: no care was taken to protect the trade of the nation: the government was de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed abroad, and insulted at home: and universal disaffection prevailed against the king and his ministry. The people naturally turned their eyes upon the duke of Lancaster as the only person from whom they could hope redress. He was a prince of the royal blood, distinguished by his great talents, beloved by the English in general, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>timulated by injuries against Richard, whose person they contemned and whose sway they detested. The malecontents, among the nobility and gen∣try, made private overtures to the duke of Lancaster, residing in France, solliciting him to return speedily to England, and head the opposition, in which case they would supply him with a powerful army, and hazard their lives and fortunes in his service. Though the duke was perfectly well pleased with these<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.</NOTE> advances, he received them at first with great caution, until he had no longer any reason to doubt the sincerity of those by whom he was addressed; and he was confirmed in his purpose by the remonstrances of Thomas archbishop of Canter∣bury, who visited him in the disguise of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riar's habit, and persuaded him that the people of England would unanimously espouse his cause against Richard.

<P>The earl of Marche, presumptive heir of the crown, having been appointed the king's lieutenant in Ireland, was slain in a skirmi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h by the native Irish; and Richard was so exasperated at the fate of his kinsman, that he de∣termined to revenge his death in person. With this view he assembled a nume∣rous army, which was enlisted, payed, and accommodated, by means of such illegal exactions and oppression as completed the disgu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the nation. About Whitsuntide he proceeded to Bristol, in order to embark, and was at∣tended by the dukes of Albemarle and Exeter, with several other noble∣men, including the sons of Lancaster and Gloucester, whom he detained as hostages for the quiet of the kingdom in his absence, during which he ap∣pointed the duke of York guardian of England. While he tarried at Bristol for a favourable wind, he sent a pursuivant to the earl of Northumberland, commanding him to join him immediately with all the forces he could raise; but that nobleman excused himself from engaging in the expedition, on pre∣tence of his being obliged to defend the Scottish marches. Richard, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ronted at his refusal, p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oclaimed the earl and all his adherents traitors, and ordered his estates to be seized for the benefit of the royal treasury. This imprudent step furnished Northumberland with a specious pretext for renouncing his alle∣giance, and perhaps provoked him to a revolt, in which he would not other∣wise have engaged. The king landing, with his forces at Waterford, marched<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyrrel.</NOTE> immediately against the Irish of Ulster, over whom he obtained several advan∣tages; insomuch that many of their petty princes, intimidated by the fame of his arms, sued for peace; and he was in a fair way of making an intire conquest of that kingdom, when he was recalled by an affair that much more nearly concerned his interest. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann.

<P>The duke of Lancaster being informed of Richard's departure from England, sent over some trusty emissaries to make his friends acquainted
<PB N="202" REF="2040"/>
with his intention, that they might be prepared to receive him at his landing; and, knowing the French king was averse to his scheme, desired that mo∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h would favour him with a safe-conduct to Brittany, where he wanted to visit the duke, who was his kinsman. This being readily granted, he set out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Nantes, where he hired three small vessels, and embarked with the arch∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hop of Canterbury, that prelate's nephew the son and heir of the late earl of Arundel, lord Cobham, Sir Thomas Erpington, Sir Thomas Ramstone, and a retinue of about fourscore persons. After having cruized along the coasts, and touched at several places, in order to discover the inclinations of the people, he at length landed at Ravenspurre in Yorkshire, pretending that his sole aim was to recover his rightful inheritance, which the king unlawfully detained; and there he was joined by the lords Willoughby, Ross, Darcy, and Beaumont. Then he proceeded to Doncaster, where his cause was espou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by the earl of Northumberland and his son Hotspur, the earl of Westmore∣land, with many gentlemen, attended by a numerous body of vassals and ad∣herents. The duke of York no sooner received intelligence of his arrival, than he summoned the warlike bishop of Chester, the lord chancellor Scrope, the earl of Wiltshire lord treasurer, Sir John Bussy, Sir Henry Green, Sir William Bagot, and Sir John Russel, to meet in London, and concert mea∣sures for the defence of the kingdom; and there they resolved to assemble the military tenants of the crown with all expedition, appointing the rendez∣vous at St. Alban's. Thither they resorted in great numbers; but the ma∣jority refused to serve against the duke of Lancaster, who, they publicly af∣firmed, had been unjustly banished and deprived of his lawful inheritance. They had another motive equally strong, for refusing their assistance on this occasion: they could not bear the presence of the earl of Wiltshire, Bussy, Green, and Bagot, who farmed the revenues of the whole kingdom; and were universally detested as the monsters of iniquity and corruption who had per∣verted the mind of Richard by their pernicious counsel. Many people who had assembled at St. Alban's, and were well disposed towards the king, retired at sight of these four unpopular ministers; who, seeing York in danger of being wholly abandoned, fled with precipitation to Bristol, in order to em∣bark for Ireland. The duke of York, finding it impossible to resist the tor∣rent of Lancaster's pop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>larity, broke his staff of office, and laid aside all thoughts of opposition: then all the rest of the nobility either declared openly for the duke of Lancaster, or held private correspondence with him and his adherents. His followers by this time amounted to threescore thousand fight∣ing men; and, in his march towards the capital, far from meeting with any interruption, he was favoured by every country through which he passed, and received in London with all the marks of triumph and exultation.</P>

<P>After having secured the city in his interest, he directed his march towards Bristol, where he had reason to believe he should meet with the greatest resistance. When he arrived at Evesham, he understood his uncle York was at Berkeley-Castle in Gloucestershire, with a body of forces, which he had raised in order to join Richard at his landing from Ireland: Lan∣caster, advancing towards his quarters, invited him to a conference; and they had an interview in the church, where matters were compromised, and the guar∣dian joined his nephew. Then they passed quietly along, and every place and

Richard is said to have slighted these tidings at first, until he was stimulated by the exhortations of the noblemen who attended him in the Irish expedition. The earl of Salisbury was sent over to raise an army in Wales, and the king promised to follow him in six days: but he was detained much longer by fri∣volous delays in the embarkation of his troops; and these delays proved the destruction of his affairs. Salisbury met with such success in his levies, that in a few days he was at the head of forty thousand men; but as the king did not arrive at the appointed time, they began to murmur, and were with great difficulty persuaded to wait for him a few days beyond the time he had fixed for his return; but that being expired, they concluded he had met with some disaster, and dispersing, retired to their own habitations.</P>

<P>At length the king, having committed the sons of Gloucester and Lancaster close prisoners to the castle of Trim, embarked for England with his forces; and, landing at Milford-Haven, proceeded to Caermarthen, where he received a particular detail of his own misfortune. He understood that the troops, assembled by Salisbury, were disbanded and dispersed; that almost all his castles, from the borders of Scotland to the Marches of Wales, had surrendered to the duke of Lancaster; that the city of London had de∣clared in his favour; that he was supported by the principal nobility of the kingdom; that the duke of York had joined him with the forces he had raised to oppose his progress; and that his favourites had lost their lives at Bristol. This concurrence of disastrous circumstances quite overwhelmed the weak mind of Richard, who abandoned himself to womanish complaints and de∣spondence. In vain did his faithful Cheshiremen endeavour to raise his droop∣ing spirits, by assuring him they would spend the last drop of their blood in his service. His courage was quite dissipated: he durst not venture a battle against the duke of Lancaster, whose army was increased to an hundred thou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and fighting men, commanded by experienced officers. The earl of Salis∣bury advised him to embark for Bourdeaux; and the bishop of Carlile, with Sir Stephen Scrope, were of the same opinion: but their advice was over-ruled by his uterine brother John Holland duke of Exeter, at whose persuasion he stole away in the night from his forces, and repaired with about twenty at∣tendants to Conway-Castle. From thence lord Thomas Piercy, steward o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the houshold, withdrew, after having publicly broke his staff of office in the castle-hall, and joined his brother the earl of Northumberland, who was th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> chief counsellor and confident of Henry duke of Lancaster. The duke of Albemarle, who, as constable of England, commanded Richard's litt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e army, was no sooner informed of the king's retreat, than he dismissed the troops, and

From thence he dispatched an express to Ireland, for the release of his own son, and the heir of the late duke of Gloucester, who had been imprisoned by Richard: the governor of the castle of Trim durst not refuse to set them at liberty; and Lancaster's son came over immediately to his father at Chester, but his cousin, embarking on board of another vessel, had the misfortune to be drowned.</P>

<P>Mean while king Richard, being bereft of all assistance and salutary advice, and distracted by a thousand fears, in the castle of Conway, sent his brother the duke of Exeter to treat with the duke of Lancaster about an accommodation, and the duke of Surrey obtained leave to accompany him in this embassy; which, however, proved very unfortunate, for they were both detained as prisoners at Chester. The duke of Lancaster having con∣sulted with his two chief confidents, the archbishop of Canterbury and the earl of Northumberland, about the means for preventing the king from leav∣ing the realm by the sea, which was still open for his escape, sent the earl to amuse him with promises, and, if possible, to bring him off by stratagem from the castle of Conway. Northumberland, advancing to the river of Conway, sent an herald to Richard, desiring a safe-conduct for himself only; which being granted, he went to the castle, and being admitted into the king's pre∣sence, demanded, in the name of the duke of Lancaster, that a parliament should be immediately summoned to reverse the sentence of banishment which had been pronounced against the duke of Lancaster, and restore him to the possession of his estate: that the dukes of Surrey and Exeter, the earl of Sa∣lisbury, and bishop of Carlile, should be tried for the offences they had com∣mitted, together with all those who were concerned in the death of the duke of Gloucester. If his majesty would assent to these proposals, Northumber∣land declared in the name of his principal, that Richard should be restored to all the prerogatives of the royal dignity; that Lancaster had sworn by the body of Christ to fulfil the articles with the utmost punctuality; and that he (Northumberland) was ready to incur the same obligation. The king himself did not much rely upon the sincerity of this ambassador; but the earl of Sa∣lisbury, the bishop of Carlile, and several other knights, being unwilling to drive matters to extremity, persuaded him to trust the earl upon his oath, which he took accordingly in the most solemn manner upon the sacrament. Then Richard desired him to ride on before, and he would follow him to Flint-Castle, where he would be nearer the duke, to settle the terms of accom∣modation. This castle had already surrendered to Northumberland; who, placing an ambush behind a rock on the road through which the king was obliged to pass, suddenly surrounded that unfortunate monarch, who was con∣veyed a prisoner to Flint-Castle. When he found himself betrayed, he de∣clared he would return to Conway: but the earl, seizing his horse's bridle, told him plainly, that he should not return; for he would conduct him to the
<PB N="205" REF="2070"/>
duke of Lancaster. Richard told him, that the God by whom he had sworn would do justice at the day of judgment: but Northumberland, without seeming to entertain any religious scruples, hurried him into the castle, where he left him with the earl of Salisbury and the bishop of Carlile, in the utmost terror and suspence; while he himself proceeded to Chester, to make the duke acquainted with the success of his expedition. Next morning Lancaster ad∣vanced at the head of his army towards Flint-Castle; and sent the archbishop of Canterbury before, with the earl of Rutland and the lord Thomas Piercy, to prepare the king for his arrival. Richard, descrying them from the walls, went down to receive them; and, when they approached his presence, they fell down upon their knees with all the marks of the most profound veneration. Then the king conferred with the archbishop in private; and afterwards this pre∣late returned to Lancaster, with his two companions, to give an account of his embassy. Immediately after their departure, the earl of Northumberland came and told the king, that the duke would not enter the castle until his majesty should have dined. Richard sat down at table with the earl, bishop, and se∣veral knights, who had followed his fortune; but their meal was very dis∣agreeably disturbed by the intrusion and insolence of several knights and esquires, belonging to the duke, who pressed into the apartment, and insulted the king's company with rude menaces of death and destruction; so that they were overwhelmed with terror and dismay. In the afternoon, the duke of Lancaster entered the castle in complete armour, save that his head was bare; and the king coming down from the tower, attended by Salisbury and the bishop, received him with the salutation of <Q>“Cousin of Lancaster, you are welcome.”</Q> The duke, bowing three times to the ground, replied in these terms: <Q>“My lord the king, I am come sooner than you appointed, because your people say you have for one and twenty years governed with rigour and indiscretion; so that they are very ill satisfied with your conduct: but, if it please God, I will help you to govern them better for the time to come.”</Q> To this declaration the king made no other answer, but <Q>“Fair cousin, since it pleases you, it pleases us likewise.”</Q> Then the duke spoke to the bishop of Carlile, and sent a message to the earl of Salisbury, import∣ing, that since he had disdained to speak to him at Paris, he should now in his turn be treated with the same disrespect. After this short dialogue, the duke ordered the king's horses to be brought out of the stable; and, two wretched animals being produced, Richard mounted one, while Salisbury made use of the other. In this sorry equipage they rode to Chester, and were conveyed to the castle with a great noise of trumpets, through a vast concourse of people, who scoffed at them as they passed along. Richard and his com∣panions were lodged in the Great Tower, where they found the duke of Exeter, and there they remained three days; during which the duke dismissed a great number of his forces, retaining only about thirty thousand men, which he deemed a sufficient number to conduct the king to London, and execute the other parts of his design.</P>

<P>At the head of this convoy, the duke began his march for the capital, with his royal prisoner, who had well nigh escaped at Litchfield, by creeping through the window of a tower into a garden, where he lay for some time concealed; but, being discovered, he was used with great barbarity, and
<PB N="206" REF="2080"/>
brought back to the Tower, where he was committed to the custody of twelve armed men, who watched continually in his apartment. At some distance from London, the duke was met by the recorder, and a number of knights and esquires, who desired, in the name of the commons of London, that he would b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>head Richard, and all those that were taken in his service: but Lan∣caster re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected the proposal, telling them, that such conduct would reflect ever∣lasting d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e upon him and all his adherents; and that he would leave the delinquents to the judgment of a free parliament. The duke was received at London by all the city companies in their liveries; and he made his entrance amidst the acclamations of the people, who cried aloud, "Long live the "good duke of Lancaster our deliverer." Richard was conveyed to the Tower, where the royal lodgings were prepared for his reception; but the duke re∣paired to St. Paul's church, where he performed his devotion at the high altar, and then kneeled at his father's tomb, which he bedewed with his tears. Having lodged a few days in the palace belonging to the bishop of London, he chose his habitation in the house of the knights of St. John in the suburbs, where he resided till the meeting of parliament, which he had already sum∣moned, in Richard's name, to meet at Westminster on the last day of Sep∣tember.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrel. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.

<HEAD>§ LXXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding all his success, the duke met with some obstacles between him and the throne, which he found some difficulty in fur∣mounting. To claim the crown by conquest, would have been an impolitic step, that must have ruined all his popularity, and raised up powerful enemies against his pretensions: and he could not, with any shadow of reason, demand it by hereditary right, during the life of Edmund, son of Roger Mor∣timer, who had been declared presumptive heir of the crown, as sineal de∣scendant of Lionel duke of Clarence. He, therefore, by the advice of his uncle the duke of York, resolved to ascend the throne upon a mixed title, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sing from the voluntary resignation of Richard, the deposition of that prince by parliament, and his own services to the nation, added to a mysterious claim deduced from Edmund Crouchback earl of Lancaster, who he pre∣tended was in fact the eldest son of Henry III. This resolution being formed, they tampered with Richard, who began to be refractory, and even retracted the promise of resigning the crown, which it seems he had made to the arch∣bishop at Conway-Castle. In all probability, he was provoked by the arrogant behaviour of Lanca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, and the personal insults he had received since his cap∣tivity. For when the duke visited him in the Tower, and told him that his uncle of York and cousin Aumerle had something to communicate to him in private, he could not help giving way to his indignation, even in presence of these noblemen, whom he taxed with having betrayed him and the kingdom. Aumerle, who stood covered in his apartment, no sooner heard these words,
<PB N="207" REF="2090"/>
than he threw his hat on the ground, telling him he lied; and Richard an∣swered, that he was an insolent traitor unworthy of his notice. Lancaster in∣terposing, checked Aumerle for the indecency of his behaviour; and treated the king with more exterior civility than he had hitherto shewn to that unfor∣tunate prince, who, when his passion subsided and he reflected cooly on his de∣plorable situation, resolved to comply with all the proposals of his adversary, well knowing that otherwise he had no mercy to expect from a conqueror of his character. When the form of resignation was brought to him on Michael∣mas day in the morning, he deferred signing the instrument until he should have conferred with his cousin Henry, who going to him in the afternoon, he execu∣ted the deed with seeming chearfulness, in presence of the archbishop of York and bishop of Hereford, whom he desired to notify his resignation to the par∣liament, and tell the estates in his name, that he wished his cousin the duke of Lancaster might be chosen as his successor. At the same time he pulled his signet∣ring from his finger, and delivered it to the duke as a further testimony of his good will, which he desired they would also communicate to the parliament. The instrument, which he himself read aloud in the hearing of those prelates, the earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, with several other noblemen, ecclesiastics, and lawyers, contained a release of fealty and homage formerly sworn by his subjects; a renunciation of the royal dignity, crown, dominions, and government, for which he owned himself altogether unqualified; and a promise that he would never retract this resignation.</P>

<HEAD>§ LXXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Next day the parliament assembling at Westminster, the pre∣lates of York and Hereford publicly declared the king's message, and produced the resignation, which being read in Latin and English, was admitted with the unanimous assent of the assembly. Then it was agreed, that for the advantage of the nation, and in order to remove all scruples and sinister suspicions, the crimes and misconduct of the king during his administration should be sum∣med up in writing, and published to the nation, that it might more plainly per∣ceive the necessity for his being deposed. Articles of impeachment were ac∣cordingly exhibited against Richard in three and thirty articles, implying, That he had, without judgment or discretion, squandered away the crown revenues, and committed the administration to persons without parts or integrity, who oppressed the people with intolerable exactions: That he had unjustly accused and punished as traitors, the commissioners established by parliament to reform the abuses of government: That he had extorted from the judges an assent to illegal opinions, with a view to condemn the earls of Arundel, Warwick, and other persons of distinction: That his uncle the duke of Gloucester was mur∣dered by his private direction: That he had levied troops to make war upon those three noblemen, and countenanced his soldiers in the commission of all manner of outrages: That notwithstanding his proclamation, declaring that those three noblemen were arrested for slight misdemeanors, he had procured their condemnation upon a charge of high treason: That he had extorted ex∣cessive fines from several counties, on pretence of crimes which had been par∣doned in the general amnesty: That he had refused to communicate the pub∣lic affairs to the commissioners established in parliament, to take charge of the administration: That he had forbid his subjects, on pain of death, to sollicit in behalf of the duke of Hereford: That although he held his crown of God

These articles being publicly read, the three estates unanimously agreed that these offences, together with Richard's own confession and resignation, furnished them with sufficient cause and authority to depose him, for the security and quiet of the people, and the advantage of the kingdom. They therefore appointed the bishop of St. Asaph, the abbot of Glastonbury, the earl of Gloucester, the lord Berkley, Thomas Erpyngham, and Thomas Grey, knights, and William Thyrning justice, as commissioners to pronounce sentence of deposition against king Richard from all royal dignity, majesty, and honour, in the name and by the authority of all the estates, as in like cases according to the ancient cus∣tom of the kingdom had been observed. The sentence being drawn up by these commissioners, was pronounced by the bishop of St. Asaph; and the three estates constituted certain persons as their proctors and agents, to go and resign to king Richard the homage and fealty which they had formerly done and promised, and to notify the sentence of his deposition.</P>

<P>The throne of England being thus vacated, Henry duke of La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣caster rising from his seat, calling upon the name of Christ, and crossing him∣self on the forehead and breast, claimed the crown with all its members and appurtenances, as the li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal descendant and right heir of blood from king Henry III.

The phial that contained this precious balm had fallen into the hands of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hermit, who gave it to Henry duke of Lancaster grandson of Henry III. assuring him, that all the kings anointed with that oil would become the true champions of the church. The duke made a present of it to Edward the Black Prince, who intended to be anointed with it, had he lived to his co∣ronation: but after his death the phial, which was of stone s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmounted by a golden eagle adorned with precious stones, stood for some time unheeded among his jewels until the latter part of his reig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, immediately before his last expedition to Ireland, when he expressed a desire of being crowned a second time, that he might have the benefit of unction from this sacred vessel; but he was diverted from his purpose by the archbishop of Canterbury, who told him, that the unction of kings ought not to be repeated. At length the phial being seized by Henry among the other jewels of Richard, he seemed to rejoice at the thought of his being the first king consecrated from such a miraculous pitcher. He was crowned with all the usual formalities on the thirteenth day o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> October, being the feast of St. Edward the Confessor, in the thirty-third year of his age; and on that same day issued a proclamation, declaring that he had ascended the thro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by the right o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conquest, the resignation of Richard in his favour, and as next heir male of the late ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g. Thus he excluded the only t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle of which he ought to have availed himself, namely, the consent of the peo∣ple; and trumped up an hereditary claim than which nothing could be more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bsurd during the life of Edmund Mortimer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who yielded to the torrent of La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>caster's fortune, and retired to his estate of Wigm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r on the Welsh Marches, where he lived privately, without expressing the least desire of opposition to the new government; for he knew the character of the u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urper, and cautiously avoided ever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> step which could possibly wake his s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spicion.

<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>The first business of the session was to pass an act of indemnity, in fa∣vour of those who had taken up arms for the house of Lancaster in the late troubles. Then they repealed all the statutes of the two last parliaments con∣voked by Richard, touching the condemnation of the three noblemen, and the excessive prerogatives which they had granted to the king, so contrary to the liberties of the subject. At the same time they renewed and confirmed the sta∣tut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s which the parliament of Shrewsbury had repealed. They enacted a law against the pope's bull, which Richard had sollicited and obtained to enforce and confirm the proceedings of his parliament. As this was in effect an ac∣knowledgment of the pope's sovereignty over England, the commons declared in this act, that the kingdom of England was independent of all foreign power; and that the pope in particular, had no right to intermeddle in the civil govern∣ment of the kingdom. The parliament at Shrewsbury, having extended the crime of treason to so many cases that every person must have been guilty, ex∣cept those who acknowledged an unlimited authority in the sovereign, that sta∣tute was now repealed; and the crime of treason reduced to those cases which were specified in a law enacted in the reign of Edward III. on the same sub∣ject. The rights and privileges of the people being thus established, the par∣liament proceeded agains<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the evil counsellors, who advised all the excesses which Richard had committed in the latter part of his administration; and this inquiry produced such violent disputes as had well nigh terminated in slaughter. The lord Fitzwalter challenged Aumerle as a traitor to king Richard; and the lord Morley taxed the earl of Salisbury with having betrayed both Richard and Henry. Other noblemen espousing the cause of those disputants, forty gaunt∣lets were thrown down in the house of lords, by individuals who defied each other to single combat; so that Henry was obliged to interpose and compro∣mise their differences. The sentence against the earls of Arundel and War∣wick was repealed, as unjust and contrary to the pardon they had fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>merly obt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined: and their accusers were deprived of their new titles, as well as of the lands of those noblemen which had been distributed among them; but their own possessions were left to the king's disposal. Henry, resolving to begin his reign with acts of clemency, allowed them to enjoy their own fortunes; though the dukes of Aumerle, Surrey, and Exeter, were now reduced to their former titles of the earls of Rutland, Kent, and Huntingdon; and the earl of Glou∣cester was compelled to resign that title for his former appellation of lord D'Es∣penser. Salisbury and Morley, who had been principally concerned in the mur∣der of the duke of Gloucester, and in all the arbitrary measures of Richard, re∣ceived no other punishment than that of a short imprisonment; though the peo∣ple demanded with loud clamour, that they should be put to death as traitors to their country. These noblemen alledged, in their own excuse, that they had ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d under Richard upon compulsion; and therefore the parliament in a n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, declared, that for the future such compulsion should be deemed no excuse <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or illegal actions.

<P>With respect to the other sov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reigns of the continent, Henry found no difficulty in reconciling them to his elevation. The emperor Winceslaus was a be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted prince, who took no co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cern in the affairs of his neighbours; and the kings o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Castile and Portugal were gainers by a revolution that pro∣moted their brother-in-law to the crown of England. This was not the case with the Gascons, who deplored the misfortunes of a prince whom they loved as the son of the val<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant Edward, and still more as their own countryman; for Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hard was born at Bourdeaux, the citizens of which resented his deposition so highly, as to threaten openly to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bmit to the king of France, rather than obey the u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.

The

court of France, resolving to make her advantage of this conjuncture, sent thither the duke of Bourbon to foment the disaffection and disgust of the Gascons; so that all the discretion of Sir Robert Knolles the governor was re∣quired to repress the spirit of rebellion. Perhaps his endeavours would have proved ineffectual, had not the earl of Worcester, one of the ambassadors at Paris, hastened to his assistance at Bourdeaux, and co-operated with him so effectually, that the commotions were appeased. These two were rein∣forced by the interest and influence of the archbishop of Bourdeaux, who acknowledged the Roman pontiff Boniface; and foresaw that, if Guienne should fall under the French dominion, he would be obliged to submit to Benedict, who resided at Avignon, and was patronized by the French monarch. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart.</NOTE></P>

<P>These troubles were scarce pacified, when Henry found himself ex∣posed to the incursions of his neighbours. Robert III. king of Scotland, taking it for granted that this revolution in England must be attended with domestic dissensions, and that the king of France would not fail to exert him∣self in favour of his son-in-law Richard, thought he could not find a more fa∣vourable juncture for invading the northern provinces, which he ravaged accordingly, and took the castle of Werk in Northumberland. Henry, whose interest it was to avoid foreign quarrels, sent ambassadors to Scotland, to demand reparation for this insult, and, at the same time, to propose a renewal of the truce; to which Robert the more readily assented, as he perceived the French king took no step to the prejudice of the usurper. The difference with Scotland being compromised, Henry neglected no opportunity to recommend himself to the affections of his people: he upon all occasions expressed the ut∣most horror at the arbitrary proceedings of his predecessor; affected to consult the interests of his subjects preferably to his own; and, as a convincing proof of his sincerity, condemned to the flames all the blank bonds which Richard had extorted from the citizens of London, and the seventeen counties which had fallen under his displeasure.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding these popular measures, he had well nigh fallen a sacrifice to a dangerous conspiracy, formed by the noblemen who had suffered from his accession to the throne. The plan is said to have been projected by the abbot of Westminster, whose house was the place of rendezvous for the conspirators. These were the dukes of Aumerle, Surrey, and Exeter, the earls of Gloucester and Salisbury, the bishop of Carlile, and Sir Thomas Blount; and they engaged as their tool one Maudlin, who had been chaplain to Richard, and resembled that prince so eactly in his lineaments and person, that they thought they could easily impose him upon the people for that mo∣narch. They resolved to institute a tournament at Oxford; and the duke of Aumerle, who enjoyed a good share of Henry's considence, undertook to in∣vite him to that diversion, when it would be in their power to seize or assassi∣nate his person. The particulars of the scheme were committed to writing, and each conspirator was provided with a copy, signed and sealed by his con∣federates. The tournament being proclaimed by the duke of Exeter and the earl of Salisbury, all the conspirators repaired to Oxford, with numerous re∣tinues, on pretence of curiosity; except the duke of Aume<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, whom they expected in vain. That nobleman, chancing to visit his father the duke of
<PB N="216" REF="2180"/>
York at Langley, was detected by his parents; who, while he sat at dinner, perceived a paper in his bosom: when York questioned him about the con∣tents, his countenance betrayed such contusion, that his father's suspicion was alarmed; he snatched the paper, and, perusing the scheme, ordered his horses to be saddled with the utmost expedition. Aumerle, guessing his intention, mounted his horse, and riding full speed to the king at Windsor, discovered the whole conspiracy, and obtained his pardon before the arrival of his father, who produced the paper, signed and sealed by the other conspirators. Henry, alarmed at this intelligence, laid aside his design of going to Oxford, and continued at Windsor until he should see what steps the confederates would take in consequence of their disappointment. When they understood that the dukes of York and Aumerle had visited the king at Windsor, they no longer doubted but that their scheme was discovered<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and resolved to execute imme∣diately by force what they could not accomplish by stratagem. They forth∣with produced Maudlin in royal attire; affirming and publishing that he was Richard escaped from prison, and come to implore the assistance of his loving subjects. By this time the fate of that unhappy prince had wrought upon the compassion of the people. They forgot all his vices, remembered his birth, his comely appearance, his former magnificence, and his present misfortune. They flocked to his standard in such crouds, that the lords of the conspiracy found themselves in a few days at the head of a numerous army, with which they began their march to Windsor, where they hoped to take the king by surprize. Henry had retired, during the preceding night, to London, where he assembled a body of twenty thousand men, and marched back as far as Hounslow-Heath, in order to give battle to the rebels, should they take the route to the capital.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1400.</NOTE> They were so discouraged by the dispatch and resolution of Henry, that, instead of advancing and hazarding an engagement, they retreated from Colebrook, where young queen Isabel resided, and encamped without the gates of Cirencester. The chiefs took up their quarters in the city; the duke of Surrey and earl of Salisbury lodging at one public inn, while the duke of Exeter and the earl of Gloucester lay at another: but they were so careless, or unexperienced in war, that they neglected to place proper guards at the gates and avenues of the town. The mayor of the place, observing this neg∣ligence, assembled four hundred men in the night; and, securing the gates, so as to exclude the troops that were encamped without the walls, attacked the four noblemen in their quarters. The duke of Surrey and earl of Salis∣bury were taken, after an obstinate defence, and beheaded on the spot by the mayor's order; while the duke of Exeter and the earl of Gloucester escaped by the tops of houses, and repaired to the camp, with a view to storm the town at the head of their forces; but they found the tents and baggage aban∣doned by the soldiers, who, hearing the noise and tumult of fighting within the town, concluded that a detachment of the king's army had entered the place, and on that supposition fled with the utmost precipitation. The two noblemen took leave of each other, that they might have the better chance of escaping single; but they were apprehended, and lost their heads in the sequel. Henry, advancing to Cirencester, found the rebels already dis∣persed, and did not fail to reward the mayor and inhabitants for their valour
<PB N="217" REF="2190"/>
and fidelity. From thence he proceeded to Oxford, where Sir Thomas Blount and Sir Benedict Sely, with six and twenty persons who had followed the duke of Exeter, were executed: and about the same time the earl of Glou∣cester and the lord Lumley, who had been also concerned in the conspiracy, were beheaded by the populace at Bristol. Maudlin, and another clergyman, called William Feriby, together with Sir Bernard Brocas and Sir John Scheveley, were executed at Tyburn. The duke of Exeter was taken at Prittlewell, and beheaded at Pleshy in Essex, without any form of process, although he had married Henry's own sister. Roger Walden late archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas Merks bishop of Carlile, were committed to the Tower, on suspicion of having privately assisted the conspirators: the first was soon released, and promoted to the see of London; but Merks was brought to his trial, and convicted of treason. He was remanded to the Tower, where he remained above twelve months; then he was removed to the Marshalsea, and afterwards obtained the king's pardon, though he was deprived of his bishopric, and died rector of Todenham in Gloucestershire. The abbot of Westminster, who had taken the field with the conspirators, was so terrified at the rout and dispersion of their troops, in the neighbour∣hood of Cirencester, that he fell into an apoplectic <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, of which he never<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hall.

Henry could plainly perceive that the imprisoned king did not want partisans who favoured his cause, both from affection to his person, and disgust to Bolingbroke, by whom they had been deceived in the motives of his invasion: he therefore concluded, that his royalty would be exposed to the attempts of malecontents while Richard was alive; and measures were taken for depriving that wretched captive of his life. The manner of his death is variously related. The adherents of Henry gave out that he starved himself to death, from grief and vexation at the miscarriage and fate of his friends. Others alledge that he was doomed to this lingering destiny by the private direction of Henry. But the generally received opinion is, that he was murdered by Sir Piers de Exton, in the following manner: This knight, hearing Henry complain that he had no fears nor apprehensions but from one quarter, to disturb him in his possession of the crown, interpreted the hint according to his own conjecture, and repaired to Pontefract, with eight fol∣lowers, to perpetrate the execrable scheme he had projected. Richard per∣ceiving that, while he sat at dinner, his victuals were not tasted according to custom, demanded the cause of this omission; and the taster telling him, that the king had sent an order to desist from that ceremony, Richard struck him on the face with a knife, exclaiming, "The devil take Harry of Lancaster "and thee together." Exton, hearing the noise occasioned by this fray, rushed into the room with eight followers in arms; and the king, concluding their design was to take away his life, resolved to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell it as dearly as he could. He wrested a pole-axe from one of the assassins, and defended himself so man∣fully, as to lay four of the number dead at his feet; when the treacherous Exton came behind his back, and with his battle-axe felled him to the ground. Had the tragedy been really acted in this manner, the marks of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE>
<PB N="218" REF="2200"/>
violence would have certainly appeared in the dead body, which was brought to London, and publicly exposed in St. Paul's church to the eyes and inspec∣tion of every observer. It seems more likely, therefore, that he perished by famine; especially as the archbishop of York, with the earls of Northumber∣land and Worcester, when they afterwards revolted against Henry, affirmed in their manif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to, that he was starved, by being kept fifteen days without sustenance. Thus died the unfortunate Richard, in the thirty-third year of his age; and his fate excited pity and regret in every compassionate bosom. He was buried at Langley in Hertfordshire; but his body was afterwards re∣moved by Henry V. to Westminster, and interred with great solemnity among his ancestors. The death of Richard, howsoever procured, was very seasonable for his successor. Charles of France had made great preparations for invading England, in order to restore his son-in law to the throne; and Henry was so alarmed at the importance of the armament, that, besides the usual precautions taken for the defence of the kingdom, he ordered archbishop Arundel to arm and array all the ecclesiastics of his province, that they might be ready to take the field on the first notice. Perhaps those preparations of France abridged the days of Richard. His death was no sooner known at the French court, than all thoughts of an invasion were laid aside: a truce for eight and twenty years was concluded between the two crowns; and it was agreed that queen Isabel, whose marriage had never been consummated, should<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. de Charl. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> return to her own country.</P>

<P>Henry's accommodation with France seems to have rendered him less scrupulous in maintaining a good understanding with Scotland. George Dunbar earl of Marche thinking himself outraged by his sovereign, in the case of a match which had been contracted between his daughter and David prince of Scotland, abandoned his own country, and retired to England; from whence he made incursions into Lothian, in conjunction with Henry Pier<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, surnamed Hotspur. Robert the Scottish king sent ambassadors to Henry, demanding that the traitor might be surrendered to justice; and, the English monarch refusing this satisfaction, Robert declared war against him, and began to prepare for an invasion. Henry resolved to anticipate his ope∣rations; and, having obtained a supply from the lords spiritual and temporal, assembled in council, levied an army, which rendezvoused at Newcastle: from thence he sent an herald to summon the Scottish king to meet him at Edinburgh, on the twenty-third day of August, in order to do homage for his kingdom; and immediately began his march for that city, at which he ar∣rived without the least opposition. He forthwith invested the castle, which was so vigorously defended by the earl of Douglas and his son-in-law David prince of Scotland, that very little progress was made in the siege; when Henry thought proper to abandon the enterprize, and return to his own do∣minions. Thither he was followed by two bodies of Scots, commanded by Hepburn and Haliburton, who fell upon the northern counties, and cruelly revenged the ravages which the English had committed in Scotland; though Hepburn was defeated and slain in his return from this expedition. The issue of this incursion disposed the Scots to agree to the proposal of a truce for six weeks; which was afterwards prolonged according to the emergency of Henry's affairs.</P>

<P>His abrupt retreat from Scotland was not so much owing to the ad∣vanced season of the year, as to the news of an insurrection in Wales, headed by Owen Glendourdwy, commonly called Glendower. This gentleman had been educated as a lawyer at the inns of court, and afterwards served Richard II. as one of his body esquires. He possessed a considerable estate in Wales; and was descended by his mother from Llewellyn ap Griffith, the last prince of that country. He conceived himself injured in the issue of a law-suit with Reginald lord Grey of Ruthyn, and did himself justice by force of arms. Re∣ginald complaining of this violence to the king, with whom he was in high favour, Henry sent the lord Talbot, with a reinforcement to his assistance; and they fell upon Owen so unexpectedly, that he had scarce time to retreat to the woods and mountains. Finding that his dispute with lord Grey was no longer considered as a private quarrel, he endeavoured to interest his country∣men in his behalf; and, by dint of eloquence, insinuation, and family-in∣fluence, persuaded them not only to renounce their dependence upon England, but also to declare him their prince and sovereign, as the lineal descendant from Llewellyn ap Griffith. Then, assembling a body of stout Welshmen, he attacked the town of Ruthyn, which he plundered and reduced to ashes. He afterwards gave battle to that nobleman, on the banks of the river Vurn∣way in Montgomeryshire, where Reginald was defeated, taken prisoner, and compelled to marry the daughter of Glendourdwy. Emboldened by this success, Owen made an irruption into the county of Hereford; and Edmund Mortimer, thinking this was a favourable opportunity to acquire the favour of Henry, raised a body of twelve thousand men to stop the progress of this Welsh invader. The two armies meeting at Pitleth in Radnorshire, a despe∣rate engagement ensued: the English were totally routed, after having lost eleven hundred men killed on the field of battle; and Mortimer himself was taken prisoner. Owen refused to admit him to ransom, on this supposition, that a person of his consequence would be redeemed by a formal negotiation; in which case he would have an opportunity of treating with Henry as an in∣dependent prince: but he was mistaken in his conjecture. Henry was too well pleased with the captivity of the true heir of the crown, to contribute to his release; and Owen, perceiving his drift, thought proper to alter his scheme, and project an alliance with his prisoner. Mean while he advanced to the side of the Severn, and ravaged the country without opposition. These events,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian.

<P>Immediately after Henry's return to London, he was visited by Ma∣nuel Paleologus emperor of Constantinople, who came to sollicit assistance against Bajazet the Turkish emperor. He was entertained with great magnifi∣cence, and received several rich presents: but Henry would not pretend to oblige him with succours, until the affairs of his own kingdom should be better established. He therefore returned to France, where he remained until he received the intelligence of Bajazet's being vanquished and taken by Ta∣merlane. The parliament meeting on the twentieth day of January,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The sect of Lollards daily increasing, it was provided that none should preach without a licence from the bishop of the diocese; and as to those who either refused to abjure their heresy, or relapsed after abjura∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, it was enacted that, upon a certificate from the diocesan bishop, or his commissaries, delivering them over to the secular arm, the civil magistrate should receive their bodies, and cause them to be burned in public. William Sautre, rector of St. Osithe's in London, was the first person who suffered in consequence of this statute: the convocation of Canterbury adjudged him an heretic relapsed; and, by the advice of the lords spiritual and temporal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Parl.</NOTE> he was burned at the end of the session. The penalties in the statute of pro∣visors were now extended to such as procured bulls from the pope, either ex∣empting them from obedience to their ordinary, or qualifying them to hold pluralities, or dispensing with them for not residing on their benefices. In this last point, however, there was an excepting clause in favour of chaplains that were in the king's service, or employed in universities, or officiating in the chapels of noblemen.</P>

<P>Since the confirmation of the truce with France, Charles VI. or rather his brother the duke of Orleans, and his uncles of Berry and Burgundy, who governed the kingdom of France in his name, had often reclaimed the young queen Isabel, widow of Richard II. and Henry had artfully eluded a categorical answer on that subject. Being extremely desirous of effecting a match between that princess and his eldest son, he proposed that alliance to the French administration, by whom it was rejected, on pretence that the king was not in a condition to manage the business of the nation; and that this was an affair of too great consequence to be discussed without his know∣ledge and participation. Notwithstanding this repulse, Henry was loth to part with the princess, because the father demanded the restitution of her dower, which had been payed to Richard: nevertheless, a negotiation was set on foot at Lelinghen to adjust this affair; and, in the mean time, the princess<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act Public.</NOTE> was sent back to France with part of her jewels.</P>

<P>Henry had been employed for some time in making preparations for an expedition into Wales, against Owen Glendourdwy; and, in the be∣ginning of June, began his march for that country, at the head of a numerous army. As Owen retired before him, he ravaged the principality, and burned the monastery of Strathflor; but his army being distressed for want of provi∣sions, and several of his detached parties cut off by Glendourdwy, he soon re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urned, without having acquired either glory or advantage. Owen, who had
<PB N="221" REF="2230"/>
prudently avoided a general engagement, was no sooner informed of his re∣treat, than he descended from the mountains, burned the suburbs of Poole in Montgomeryshire, and laid waste the adjoining Marches. Then he repaired with a very small body of troops to the hills of Plimlymmon, which he had ap∣pointed for the rendezvous of his forces, and from thence sent out detachments <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o ravage the county of Pembroke, and the neighbourhood of Cardigan, in∣habited by the descendents of those Flemish and English families who had for∣merly settled in that country: these assembling to the number of fifteen hundred, surrounded him so suddenly in one of his incursions, that he must have been taken, had not he and his men made a desperate effort of courage, and attacked the enemy with such fury that they were entirely routed. This victory was a great addition to the reputation of Owen, whose countrymen began to look upon him as the person destined to restore their former indepen∣dency, and flocked to his banner from all quarters. Henry, alarmed at his success, invaded Wales again in October, when Owen retiring as before to his fastnesses, nothing of consequence was transacted, and the king marched back to London, extremely disgu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted at the bad success of his undertaking. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>He was in some measure consoled for these domestic troubles, by the alliances which he contracted on the continent. The duke of Gueldres renewed his league with England, which had been formed under the preceding reign; and Henry's eldest daughter Blanche was married to Lewis duke of Bavaria, eldest son of Rupert the German emperor. Next year she was con∣ducted into Germany, with a fortune of twenty thousand marks, which was levied by an aid of twenty shillings for a knight's fee, or twenty pounds a year in lands held immediately of the crown. This aid was raised, by virtue of the royal prerogative, throughout the whole kingdom. Another treaty of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1402.</NOTE> mar∣riage was set on foot between Henry's daughter Philippa, and Eric king of Denmark, who married the princess accordingly; though a match which had been projected between the Dane's sister Catherine, and Henry prince of Wales, did not succeed. Henry himself had for some time made his addresses to Jane of Navarre, widow of John IV. duke of Brittany, who privately ob∣tained from the Avignon pope Benedict, two dispensations, without which thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> marriage could not have taken effect. One permitted her to marry a relation, in the third or fourth degree of consanguinity; and by the other she was al∣lowed to communicate with such as payed canonical obedience to pope Boni∣face, who was acknowledged in England. The duchess, thus eased of her scruples, sent over Anthony Rose as her proxy, and was contracted to Henry at Eltham: but before she could come in person, the nobility of Bretagne received intimation of her design, and being apprehensive of her carrying the young duke with her to England, obliged her to deliver him up to Philip duke of Burgundy, his nearest relation. That nobleman, with the consent of the states, took upon him the tuition of her children, with the government of the country, and conveyed the young duke to Paris for his education. His mother setting <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail from Brittany, under the conduct of the earl of Worcester, landed after a dangerous passage at Falmouth, from whence she proceeded to Winchester, where the nuptials were solemnized; and she was afterwards crowned at Westminster. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>It was at this period that Henry received the intelligence of Glen∣do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wy's success against lord Grey and Mortimer; and though he secretly rejo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced at Edmund's captivity, he interested himself deeply for his favourite Grey, and assembled another large army to take vengeance on the conqueror. The rendezvo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces was at Shrewsbury, where he divided them into three b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dies, giving the command of one to the prince of Wales, and of an∣other to the earl of Arundel, while the third marched under his own auspices. These divisions entered Wales at three different places, in order to surround Glendourdwy, who had retired to the mountains of Snowdun. But they met with such tempestuous weather, that it was hardly possible to keep the field, and they were obliged to retire without having performed any military exploit. Henry was extremely mortified at three successive miscarriages; and is said to have employed treacherous means to take away the life of Glendourdwy, who baffled all his designs of per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idy as well as open war, and acquired the reputa∣tion of a magician among the English people, who supposed he had made a compact with the devil.

<P>The king's ill success in Wales was recompensed by the fortune of his arms in the north of England. Archibald earl of Douglas, with the flower of the Scottish nobility, made an irruption into the English Marches, at the head of thirteen thousand men, and ravaged the country for some time without opposition; but on their return to Scotland, they found themselves intercepted by a strong body of English troops, commanded by the earl of Northumberland, his son Henry Hotspur, George earl of Dunbar, who was a refugee in England, and the lord Greystoke. The two armies engaged each other at Holmedon-hill, near Wallover, on the borders of Northum∣berland towards Scotland; but victory did not long hover in suspence. The Scots were drawn up on the declivity of the hill, so as to stand quite exposed to the arrows of the English archers, who plied them so vigorously, that no armour could resist the force of their missiles. Douglas perceiving their advantage, or∣dered his men at arms to advance and attack the English bowmen, who retired as they approached, still letting fly their arrows, until that body of Scots was fatigued with the weight of their armour, and the rest of their army left ex∣posed to the English archery, which made such havock among them, that they could no longer stand the shock, but fled with great precipitation. In this battle, which was fought on Holyrood-day, seven hundred Scots were left dead upon the field of battle, besides a great number that perished in the Tweed. The earl of Douglas, who was dangerously wounded, and lost an eye in the engagement, was taken prisoner, together with Mordack earl of Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, son to the duke of Albany; the earls of Murray, Angus, and Orkney, the lords Montgomery and Erskine, and about fourscore knights of distinc∣tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gham.</NOTE> Henry having received advice of this victory, sent orders to the victors forbidding them to ransom their prisoners; declaring at the same time, that he did not mean to deprive them of their right, but desired the captives might not be disposed of without his directions.</P>

<P>The parliament being assembled on the thirtieth day of Septem∣ber at Westminster, the prisoners were presented to both houses, who thanked the earl of Northumberland for his services. But it was not without re∣luctance that they granted a continuation of the subsidy on wool and leather, the tonnage on wines, the poundage on merchandise, and a tenth and fifteenth, tho' on condition that they should not be drawn into a precedent. The clergy in this session obtained a confirmation of all their privileges, particularly that which exempted them from prosecutions in the king's courts for felonies, ex∣cept such as touched his person, crown, and royal dignity. By this time a dangerous spirit of disaffection was diffused throughout the whole kingdom, by those who regreted and resented the deposition and murder of Richard. A report was industriously circulated all over England, that the late king was still alive, and had levied an army in Scotland, in order to expel the usurper. Pa∣pers were affixed to the church-doors, and in other public places, containing invectives against Henry, and affirming that the faults for which Richard had been deposed were trifles in comparison with the tyranny which Bolingbroke had exercised since his usurpation. Henry was so exasperated at these sarcasms, that he swore he would never pardon any person who should be convicted of having offered them to the public. Sir Roger Clarendon, natural son of the Black Prince, was apprehended on suspicion of being concerned in a plot against the government, with the priest of Ware, the prior of Lawne, and nine other Franciscan friars, who were hanged at Tyburn without any formal conviction. These severities served only to encrease the number of malecontents, and destroyed the opinion which the people had formerly conceived of the king's clemency and humane disposition. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>In the course of the summer, the Bretons being now entirely in∣fluenced by French counsels, committed depredations upon the coast of Eng∣land; and the English deputies, at the congress at Lelinghen, complained of this violation of the truce. The French ambassadors alledged that the English had been the aggressors: but, as a rupture was deemed equally incon∣venient by both sides, they waved all punctilios, and the truce was again confirmed. This affair being amicably terminated, the French ambassadors demanded the restitution of Isabel's dower; and the English replied, that they did not doubt but their master, with a view to maintain a good understand∣ing between the two crowns, would be content to deduct that sum from the million and a half of crowns still due for the ransom of king John. The plenipotentiaries of France were not a little surprized at this declaration, which they declined answering, until they should have received farther instructions. But, while the court of England was engrossed with feasting and rejoicings on account of the king's marriage, the French made a descent upon the isle of Wight, under the conduct of Valeran, count de St. Pol of the house of Lux∣embourg, who had married an uterine sister of Richard II. and now pretended, in his own name, to revenge the death of his brother-in-law. The court of France connived at his design, and even furnished him with troops for the en∣terprize, which, however, did not succeeed according to his expectation; for, after having plundered some villages, he was shamefully repulsed to his ships by the inhabitants, without any military reinforcement. Henry complained of this invasion to the court of France, from which he could extract no other.
<PB N="$$4" REF="2260"/>
reply, but that the king's intention was to observe the truce, which was again confirmed; and the king of England put up with the affront, rather than in∣volve himself in a foreign war, while such discontents prevailed within his own kingdom. The ministry of Charles were not ignorant of Henry's situa∣tion and sentiments; and, as they hated his person, they took no pains to<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> dissemble their aversion. The duke of Orleans, as champion for Richard's memory, challenged him to single combat, at the head of an hundred knights: but Henry rejected his defiance, as coming from an inferior, telling him at the same time, that they might chance to meet in battle, where they would have an opportunity of measuring their swords according to his desire. The duke, incensed at the contempt with which Henry had treated him, reproached him, in a second letter, with the epithets of traitor, usurper, and regicide. Bolingbroke, in answer to this outrage, gave him the lie in form, and accused him of having practised sorcery, in order to intail upon his brother Charles the malady with which he was afflicted. The English ambassadors, who still continued their conferences at Lelinghen, demanded, in the king's name, whether or not this challenge was avowed by their master; for, if it was, Henry would look upon it as an open rupture; and the French plenipoten∣tiaries would make no other answer, but that it was their king's intention to observe the truce with good faith and punctuality. These, in their turn, de∣manded the dower of Isabel; and the king of England persisting in his pre∣tensions to the ransom of king John, the one debt balanced the other, and there the affair rested.</P>

<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time a dangerous storm impended over Henry's head in England, which had been brewed by the most powerful noblemen of the kingdom. We have already observed, that immediately after the victory at Holme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, the king forbad the victors to dispose of their prisoners without his direction. He afterwards sent a peremptory order, demanding they should be delivered into his hands; and the earl of Northumberland ex∣postulated with him, upon the injustice of depriving them of the ransom to which they were intitled by the laws of war. The earl presumed too much upon his own service; and talked in such terms as disgusted Henry, who re∣buked him for the freedom of his discourse, and desired him to keep his proper distance for the future. The impatient spirit of the Piercies took fire at this behaviour in the king, which they considered as an unpardonable indignity. The father and son looked upon themselves as the support of his government; and they thought they were as able to depose him as they had been instru∣mental in raising him to the throne: Northumberland's brother Thomas earl of Worcester not only espoused their quarrel, but also laid a plan of revenge, which had well nigh deprived Bolingbroke of his royalty. He proposed a cor∣respondence with Mortimer, who had by this time married the daughter of Owen Glendourdwy; and that nobleman, with his father-in-law, readily con∣curred in a scheme for dethroning Henry, and elevating Mortimer as the true heir of blood to the throne of England. Douglas and others of the Scottish pri∣soners were engaged as their associates, on condition of being released without ransom; and they returned to their own country, in order to raise forces for the assistance of those by whom they had so lately been defeated. Worcester was the soul of this conspiracy. He not only projected the plan, but executed a
<PB N="225" REF="2270"/>
contract of partition among the parties; by which the crown and kingdom of England was assigned to Mortimer; the whole country to the northward of the Trent fell to the share of Northumberland, to be held by homage to the king; and Owen Glendourdwy was to be gratified with all the counties to the westward of the Severne. An immediate pretence for revolt being still wanting, the earl of Northumberland, who dissembled his resentment, represented to the king, that as Mortimer had been taken in his service, it was but reasonable that he should pay his ransom. Henry, piqued at this remonstrance, replied, that the earl of Marche had taken the field of his own accord for the defence of his own estate; and therefore his dispute with Owen was a private quarrel with which the king had no manner of concern: he at the same time hinted, that Morti∣mer had surrendered to Owen on purpose to carry on a correspondence with that traitor more conveniently; and flatly refused to contribute one farthing towards his release. Young Piercy, who had married Mortimer's aunt, loudly ex∣claimed against this refusal, which he said was a sure proof that Henry dreaded the right and title of Mortimer, who he hoped would die in captivity; and this argument had great weight with such people as were attached to the right of lineal succession.</P>

<DIV4 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>The earl of Northumberland with his brother and son retired to the north, in order to levy forces and wait for the Scottish auxiliaries; and those arriving, Worcester and Hotspur began their march towards Cheshire, where they expected to be joined by the natives of that country, as well as by a strong body of Welsh under Mortimer and Glendourdwy, who had promised to meet them on the Marches. In the mean time the earl of Northumberland remained at Berwick, on pretence of being indisposed; though in reality to assemble another body of troops, with which he might join the confederates in case they should prove successful in their first attempt; and that he might be at hand to retire into Scotland, provided the enterprize should miscarry, and he himself be considered by Henry as an accomplice of the rebels. Before they took the field they had pulled off the mask, renounced their allegiance to Henry of Bolingbroke, and published a manifesto, charging him with treachery and perfidy, in having de∣throned his lawful prince, contrary to the oath which he had taken in their hearing at Doncaster, immediately after his arrival in England. They likewise accused him of having ruled in a tyrannous manner, and rendered himself in∣accessible to every body but the clergy, insomuch that the greatest nobleman of the land could not be admitted to his presence, unless introduced by some bi∣shop; and they afhrmed that he had converted to his own private uses, the subsidies which had been granted for the occasions of the public. The king published an answer to this declaration; and by the advice of the Scottish earl of Dunbar, who resided at his court, took the field immediately, with the forces which he had luckily provided for another Wel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h expedition. Having pro∣ceeded as far as Burton upon Trent, he received intelligence that Worcester and his nephew had marched towards the frontiers of Wales, in order to join Mortimer and Glendourdwy: and here again Dunbar with some difficulty pre∣vailed upon him to alter his route, and hinder if possible their conjunction. He accordingly wheeled about, and directed his march towards Shropshire; and this motion in all probability saved him from destruction; for Owen had actually advanced as far as Oswestre, with a body of twelve thousand men, in
<PB N="226" REF="2280"/>

The Piercies had given out that the late king was still ahve, and that their intention was to deliver him from captivity; and this assertion brought numbers to serve under their ban∣ners. They had marched to Shrewsbury, and even invested the place, when the king's army appeared in fight<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then Hotspur abandoned the siege, and with∣drew his forces to Hartlefield, about three miles from Shrewsbury, where he resolved to hazard an engagement.</P>

<P>His troops did not exced fourteen thousand fighting men, includ∣ing the Scottish auxissaries under the earl of Douglas; and the king's forces were not much more numerous. After both armies were drawn up in order of battle, Henry's resolution seemed to fail him. He had formerly fought for glory as a private adventurer, but now his crown as well as his life was at stake<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he found himself on the eve of a battle, with two noblemen counted the bravest and the best commanders in Christendom. Staggered by these re∣flections, he sent the abbot of Shrewsbury with proposals of accommodation to Worcester; and made such concessions, as would in all probability have satis∣fied the unexperienced Piercy, who was but little acquainted with the arts and equivocation of mankind. His uncle knew how little was to be depended upon the promise or concessions of a prince, who acts from the necessity of his affairs; and misrepresented the king's message to Hotspur, who sent a defiance to Hen∣ry, and made a short speech to his soldiers, encouraging them to exert all their manhood to save themselves from disgrace, and the hands of the common execu∣tioner, which, should they be conquered, would finish what the sword should leave. Henry seeing his terms rejected and the rebels preparing to give him battle, recollected all his fortitude, and with the help of the earl of Dunbar and his son Henry prince of Wales, made an excellent disposition of his forces. His Scottish counsellor, who was upon this occasion not only actuated by his attachment to his benefactor, but also by his hatred of Douglas the rival of his house and reputation, supposing that an effort would be made against the per∣son of Henry, advised that several persons might be cloathed in the same kind of attire, and followed by the same sort of attendants and equipage that usually distinguished the king. The advice was approved, and in all likelihood saved<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch. 14<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.</NOTE> the life of Bolingbroke. The battle began with a discharge of arrows on both sides; then the Scots under Douglas, and a choice body commanded by Hot∣spur, charged the front of the king's line with such fury, that they bore down all before them, until they had penetrated to the royal standard, which was beaten down. The king's horse was killed under him; and the prince of Wales received a wound in the face, while he fought with incredible prowess. The impetuosity of Piercy and Douglas was the cause of their overthrow; they r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hed on with such precipitation, that their soldiers could not follow them; and the line which they had broken closing again, intercepted their retreat. They sought close by one another, and performed miracles of valour with the few who had fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>owed their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Douglas slew three different persons who passed for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of England by their coats of armour and distinctions: but all their followers being slain, they found themselves hemmed in on all sides, without any prospect of being joined or relieved by the rest of their forces, who knew not how to act when thus deprived of their leaders. The king per∣ceiving
<PB N="227" REF="2290"/>
their confusion, put himself at the head of a body of reserve, and fall∣ing in among them, made terrible havock; while Piercy and Douglas resolved to cut their way back to their own forces. All opposition failed before them, until Hotspur was slain by an arrow; and his death was no sooner known, than his whole army betook themselves to flight with the utmost precipitation, after the battle had lasted three hours, during which it was maintained with equal valour on both sides. The king himself exposed his person like the meanest soldier in his army, charged the enemy sword in hand, and is said to have slain six and thirty men with his single arm. The prince of Wales be∣haved with the utmost gallantry; and the victory was in a great measure owing to the conduct and sedate valour of the earl of Dunbar. On the king's side, Edmund earl of Stafford, who commanded the first line, Sir Hugh Shirley, Sir John Clifton, Sir John Cokaine, Sir Nicholas Gausel, Sir John Calverley, Sir John Massey, Sir Hugh Mortimer, and about sixteen hundred men were left dead upon the spot, and above three thousand grievously wounded. The rebel army lost double that number: the earls of Worcester and Douglas were taken prisoners, together with the baron of Kinderton, and Sir Richard Vernon. All these were beheaded at Shrewsbury, except Douglas, whom the king dis∣missed without ransom on account of his valour. Hotspur's body was at first buried by the permission of Henry; but he afterwards ordered it to be dug up and quartered, that the different parts might be exposed in different places of the kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingham.</NOTE></P>

<P>Immediately after the battle, the king sent a commission to the earl of Westmoreland, Henry Fitzhugh, Ralph Ewer, William Gascoigne, and Sir Robert Waterton, to raise the militia of the northern counties, and disperse the forces assembled by the earl of Northumberland. That nobleman had ad∣vanced into the bishopric of Durham, in his way to join his brother; and the earl of Westmoreland had already assembled a body of forces to dispute his passage; but Piercy, receiving intelligence of the disaster at Shrewsbury, marched back to Newcastle, from whence he retired to his castle of Werkworth, where he dismissed his troops, and remained until king Henry arrived at York, and summoned him to appear in that city. Thither he repaired with a small retinue, after having previously received an assurance of pardon; and the king admitted the apology which he made for his conduct: though he treated him with great coldness and indifference, and obliged him to give security for his appearance at the ensuing parliament. Perhaps he would have met with more rigorous treatment, had not Henry thought it impolitic to drive a nobleman to despair, who was in possession of Berwick, Alnewick, and Werkworth; be∣sides the castles that were occupied by his friends and vassals, who had escaped from the battle of Shrewsbury. The king having exacted a new oath of alle∣giance from the noblemen and freeholders of the northern counties, and forbid, on severe penalties, all depredations upon those who had been concerned in the insurrection, returned towards the borders of Wales, in order to proceed upon another expedition against Owen Glendourdwy; but this design was de∣feated by his w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of money for the subsistence of his army. He called a coun∣cil of war to deliberate upon ways and means for removing this difficulty; and some of the courtiers proposed, that he should seize the money and rich equi∣pages of the prelates who served in the expedition. The king seemed to relish
<PB N="228" REF="2300"/>
the expedient, when archbishop Arundel declared that they should win with blows, whatever they should get from him and his retinue. The king did not chuse to quarrel with this resolute prelate; and the archbishop made him amends for his forbearance, by procuring him the grant of a tenth in the next convo∣cation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ingham.</NOTE></P>

<P>While Henry was thus employed in the north of England, the court of France resolved to take advantage of the troubles of the nation. The duke of Orleans intended to make a descent upon the English coast, while John, the young duke of Burgundy, should undertake the siege of Calais: but Henry's success against the rebels defeated these projects; though the French ministry encouraged the inhabitants of Bretagne, to commit depreda∣tions upon the English. They accordingly fitted out a number of ships, with which they harraffed the western coast, and even plundered the town of Ply∣mouth. Henry, complaining of this violation of the truce, and receiving very little satisfaction from the French court, permitted the inhabitants of Plymouth to make reprisals; and they equipped a small fleet, of which they gave the command to William Wilford, who took vengeance effectually upon the Bre∣tons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

Thus acquitted, the earl petitioned that he might renew his oath of allegiance, which he swore anew upon the cross of Canterbury; and then the king remitted his fine and ransom. The com∣mons having thanked the king and lords in full parliament for their just and equitable judgment, petitioned that his majesty would abo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish all animosities subsisting among the noblemen of the realm; and at his command, the earl of No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thumberland and Westmoreland embraced each other with marks of the most perfect reconciliation, promising that they themselves, and their tenants and vassals, should for the future live in peace and amity. The earl of Dunbar was likewise reconciled to Northumberland; and the archbishop of Canterbury, the duke of York, with several prelates and lords, suspected of having been concerned in the late conspiracy, were cleared by the king, and declared true and loyal subjects. Certain Bretons who came over with the queen, being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of carrying on a correspondence with the French, articles of complaint were presented against the king's confessor, the abbot of Dore, and two gentle∣me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the bed-chamber, who were immediat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly dismissed by the king; and his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> declared that he would retain no person in his service, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be disagreeable to his people.

<PB N="229" REF="2310"/>
the present state of his affairs required great management and oeconomy. They desired he would resume all the grants on the dutchy of Cornwal, made by himself or his predecessors, that they might be re-annexed to the crown for the maintenance of the prince of Wales; they requested that he would not grant away the profits of his castles, which were repaired at the charge of the na∣tion, but that he would settle the expence of his houshold upon a certain estab∣lishment. The king made satisfactory answers to all these petitions; reduced the charges of his family to ten thousand one hundred pounds a year; declared his intention to reform the abuses which had crept into his housekeeping; and assured the commons, by the mouth of the archbishop of Canterbury, that the proceedings of the common law should not for the future be disturbed or de∣layed by letters under the privy seal, or any other interposition whatever. In the mean time, he desired the parliament would take orders for discharging the debts of his houshold, and appoint treasurers to inspect the management of the money appropriated for the service of the public. How this money was raised does not appear in the proceedings of this parliament: though we are told by a certain historian, that a very oppressive tax was imposed upon the people, on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham.</NOTE> condition that it should not be drawn into a preceden<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and that no evidences of such a tax should be preserved in the treasury or exchequer.

The duke's conduct was influenced by a personal aversion to Henry; and the French ministry connived at these infringements of the truce, in hope that some insurrection in England, joined to the efforts of Glendour∣dwy, would afford an opportunity to declare open war against Henry, whom they considered as an usurper. He was well acquainted with their sentiments, and found it convenient to temporize, until he should have triumphed over all domestic opposition. It certainly was his interest to avoid a war with his neigh∣bours at such a juncture; and for that reason, he not only winked at the in∣sults which he suffered from the French, but even sollicited a truce with Scot∣land, which was concluded in the month of July, to continue till the ensuing Easter.</P>

The king seemed to be averse to another expedition into Wales, where he had been already so unfortunate: and at present he was restrained from prosecuting that war, by a ferment in the midst of his kingdom, raised by a very trivia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> incident. The idle report of Richard's being alive was now revived, and gained more credit than ever. One Serle, who had been his do∣mestic, repaired to Scotland to see his old master, and engaging as an accom∣plice in the deceit, wrote letters to different people in England, assuring them that king Richard was in being and in good health. The evidence of a man, who could not possibly be mistaken in the person of a prince whom he had long attended, produced such an effect, that one half of the nation was deceived by the imposture, which was greatly assisted by the old countess of Oxford, mo∣ther of the duke of Ireland, who had been attainted in the reign of Richard. This lady not only pretended to confirm the report from her own knowledge, but presented a great number of persons, in his name, with little harts made of sil∣ver, like those with which that prince used to distinguish his favourites. The king, alarmed at the consequence of this deceit, which was propagated and supported in all parts of the kingdom by artful monks, who acted as her emissaries, ar∣rested the countess, who was confined to close prison, and deprived of her estate; and some of her agents were convicted and executed as seditious im∣postors. As the earl of Northumberland was suspected of favouring the cheat, Henry made a progress to Pontefract, where that nobleman surrendered him∣self, with all his grandsons and descendants; so that the king was fully convin∣ced of his innocence: though he obliged the earl to give up the town and cas∣tle of Berwick, and the fortress and forest of Jedburgh, with all its appurtenan∣ces; in consideration of which Henry agreed to gratify him and his heirs with an equivalent, by the advice of the parliament o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> council. Ser<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, being tired of maintaining the person who had assumed the name of Richard, addressed himself to Sir William Clifford governor of Berwick, whom he knew to be upon bad terms with Henry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but that officer, instead of supplying him with money to carry on the imposture, made his peace with the king, by delivering him up to justice. Finding himself convicted and condemned, he not only explained the deceit, but owned that he had been concerned in the murder of the duke of Gloucester at Calais; so that he justly suffered the death of a traitor, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Speed.</NOTE> nation was at length disabused.</P>

<P>This alarm being past, the king resolved to act against Glendour∣dwy with his whole power, so as to reduce that rebel in one campaign; but as he wanted money to defray the expence of the expedition, he convoked a par∣liament at Coventry on the sixth day of October; and as he had always been thwarted in his measures by the meddling clergy and practitioners of the law, who piqued themselves upon knowing the constitution, he stretched his prero∣gative in a very unjustifiable manner, by inserting a clause in the writ of sum∣mons,
<PB N="231" REF="2330"/>
excluding all persons who understood the law from being elected; and when the members were returned, it was not without reason that they acquired the name of the Illiterate Parliament. The bishop of Lincoln, who was Hen∣ry's brother, and chancellor of England, observed, in his speech at the opening of the session, that the supplies granted by the late parliament had not been adequate to the necessities of the government; and that it was absolutely ne∣cessary to vote a considerable sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idy for the reduction of Wales, and the de∣fence of the kingdom from foreign adversaries, as the truce with Scotland would expire in the spring, and the French ministry seemed very much disposed to an open rupture with England. The commons, by way of answer to this demand, went in a body and presented an address to the king, importing, that without burthening his people, he might relieve the necessities of the state by seizing the revenues of the clergy, who possessed one third of the riches in the kingdom, and ought to contribute largely to the occasions of the government, as they were totally exempted from personal service. The archbishop of Can∣terbury, who was present when they delivered this address, perceiving by the king's countenance that the proposal was not all disagreeable, stood up and op∣posed it with great vehemence. He refuted the allegations in the address, by representing, that although the clergy did not serve personally in the wars, they could not therefore be deemed useless members of society; inasmuch as they sent their vassals and tenants to serve in the army, when their service was re∣quired. He said, that in stripping the clergy of their possessions, he would put a stop to the prayers which they offered up incessantly to heaven for the prof∣perity of the state; and that he could not expect that God would vouchsafe his protection to the kingdom, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so little regard should be payed to the interest of the clergy. He desired the commons to take notice, that they would not find it an easy matter to deprive the clergy of their possessions, without ex∣posing the kingdom to the most dangerous convulsions; and declared, that while he occupied the see of Canterbury, he would oppose such injustice to the last moment of his life. He then fell upon his knees before the king, and con∣jured him, as he valued his eternal salvation, to avoid a step which would not only be a direct violation of his coronation oath, but also oblige the clergy to proceed to such ecclesiastical cen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures, as would throw the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e kingdom into confusion. Henry, startled perhaps at this last insinuation, assured him that his fears were altogether without foundation; for that he was firmly determined to execute the resolution he had made when he a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cended the throne, and would maintain the church in all her rights and privileges. The archbishop, en∣couraged by this assurance, turned to the commons, and rebuked them severely for their presumption in presenting such an address, which was the effect of impiety and avarice. Notwithstanding this reproof, to which they made no reply, they persisted in their resolution, and brought in a bill for seizing the re∣venues of the clergy; but these last had such influence among the nobility, that it was thrown out by the house of lords; and the commons were obliged to devise other ways and means for supplying the king's necessities. After some<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ingham.</NOTE> debate, they, with the assent of the lords, granted a considerable subsidy on wool and wool-fells, wine, and other merchandize, on condition that it should be applied to the expence of the war and the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of the realm, under the in∣spection of the lord Furnival and Sir John Pelham, appointed treasurers for

They resolved to make proclamation, that all who possessed patents of any annual value, granted since the fortieth year of Edward III. should, on pain of forfeiture, bring them in by a certain day ap∣pointed, that the merits of the possessors might be examined, and their patents continued or revoked accordingly. After these steps towards a reformation of the revenues, the commons, upon a petition of the prince of Wales, exhibited in parliament, voted him a thousand marks a year for maintaining a body of men to defend the Welsh Marches. They recommended the king's sons John and Humphrey to their father for honourable preferment. They, in an address to his majesty, de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired the duke of York might receive the arrears due to him for his services in Guienne, which they hoped the king would not forget; and requested that he would order restitution to be made to Richard, brother to the duke of York, of some valuable jewels which were in the hands of the late king.</P>

The kingdom was filled with murmurs and discontent, industriously fomented by the emissaries of those, who either wished well to the heir of blood, or smarted from the severity of the reigning king, or dreaded the de∣signs of his policy, and the rapaciousness of his avarice, which was not yet satisfied with the great sum belonging to Richard that fell into his hands, and the exorbitant subsidies granted by parliament. The nation in general seemed ripe for revolt, and naturally turned their eyes upon Mortimer, who still re∣mained in captivity. Henry, far from treating for his ransom, had seized his children, and confined them in the castle of Windsor, as hostages for the conduct of their father, whom the king suspected of intrigues against his go∣vernment, in conjunction with Glendourdwy. The countess dowager of Thomas Spenser e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l of Gloucester, who had been beheaded at Bristol, un∣dertook to effect the deliverance of those children; and, by means of false keys that opened the locks under which they were confined, accomplished their escape from Windsor: she had even conveyed them as far as the Marches of Wales, when she was seized by the officers of Henry, who or∣dered the sons of Mortimer to be more closely confined and narrowly watched for the future. The countess being examined before the council, not only confessed that she had been instigated to this attempt by her brother the duke of York, but also accused him of having formed a design to scale the walls of Eltham, and take away the life of his sovereign.

<P>The king justly concluding from this attempt, that something else of more consequence would be undertaken in favour of Mortimer's claim, thought it high time to take effectual measures against his Welsh ally. He assembled a body of forces, the command of which he b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stowed upon the prince of Wales, who marched thither in the spring, and routed part of the Welsh army. He still continued to advance after this action; and, in two months, fought another battle, near Grosmont in Monmouthshire, against a body of eight thousand men, commanded by Griffith, eldest son of Owen Glendourdwy, who was routed and taken prisoner; his uncle Tudor being killed upon the spot. He resembled his brother so exactly, that his body being found among the slain, was mistaken for Owen; and this report, added to the bad success of the battle, overwhelmed the Welsh with consternation. The prince of Wales, after his victory, advancing farther into South Wales, invested the castle of Lampader in Cardiganshire; and the garrison agreed to surrender, if not relieved by the first day of October. The Welsh would have been dispirited by this bad success, had not they been amused by France, from which they expected powerful assistance. The duke of Orleans, who go∣verned that kingdom, payed no regard to the truce subsisting with England. He engaged in a league with Glendourdwy; sent the constable d'Albert and the count d'Armagnac with an army into Guienne, where they reduced sixty places belonging to the English. The duke himself made an attempt upon Bourg and Blaye: the duke of Burgundy resolved to undertake the siege of Calais; and, in order to facilitate the enterprize, the count of St. Pol at∣tempted to surprize the castle of Merck; but he was repulsed by the garri∣son of Calais, even after he had made a lodgment in the court-yard of the castle.</P>

<P>Henry guessed from these insolent infractions what he had to ex∣pect from the French ministry, in case his affairs should assume an unfavour∣able aspect in England; and for that reason was very sollicitous to suppress the Welsh rebellion. He had assembled a council of the nobility, in order to obtain a supply of money, which he was ashamed to ask of the parliament, because it had so lately accommodated him with a considerable subsidy: but the nobility absolutely refused to comply with his request; and he met with the same repulse from the clergy. By this time a powerful faction was formed against his administration. Richard Scrope archbishop of York, and brother to the earl of Wiltshire, who had been beheaded at Bristol, engaged in a league with Thomas Mowbray earl mareschal, and the earl of Northumber∣land, to make another effort to dethrone Henry, in favour of Mortimer; and the lords Bardolfe, Hastings, Falconbridge, and many other noblemen and gentlemen, joined in the association. Having levied a considerable army at York, they published a manifesto against the king, containing nine articles, importing, that Henry, when he arrived in England, had protested and sworn that he came for no other purpose but the recovery of his private estate, without having any pretensions to the crown, which he nevertheless usurped:

<P>Ralph earl of Westmoreland being apprised of their intention, rai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed a body of troops; and, joining the forces under John of Lancaster, warden of the East Marches, advanced against the revolting lords, in order to suppress the rebellion, before they should be joined by the earl of Northum∣berland. He found them encamped on Shipton-Moor, about two leagues to the northward of York; but, perceiving they already out-numbered his fol∣lowers, and waited with impatience for an engagement, he altered his plan, and resolved to defeat them by stratagem or treachery. He sent an agent to propose an interview, which being granted, he met the archbishop of York, the earl mareschal, and the rest of the confederate lords, in fight of both ar∣mies. There he protested that he heartily concurred with them in their con∣cern for the welfare and prosperity of his country; and in general approved the articles of their manifesto. Then he proposed some measures for the ac∣complishment of their design; and cajoled them in such a manner, that they were convinced of his being a sincere well-wisher to the scheme they had pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected. He called for wine, and they drank together in token of amity: he even affected to embrace them with the most cordial affection; and ordered his attendants to retire, as a proof of his confidence in their honour and friend∣ship. This frank manner of proceeding had such an effect <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the confede∣rates, that they likewise dismissed their followers, who were no sooner out of sight, than Westmoreland's guard returned at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull speed, and seized the arch∣bishop and Mowbray, before they could receive any succour from their ad∣herents.

Henry

was on his march to the north, when the archbishop and Mowbray were surprized by Westmoreland, who delivered them into his majesty's hands at the castle of Pontefract. The king ordered the liberties of York to be seized; and, when he arrived at Bishopsthorp, on the eighth day of June, commanded Sir William Gascoigne, chief justice of England, to try the archbishop for high treason: but he declining the office, Sir William Ful∣thorp, another judge, pronounced sentence of death against him as a traitor; and he was beheaded immediately after condemnation.</P>

<P>He had acquired such a character for sanctity, and died with such composure and resolution, that the common people looked upon him as a martyr; and he was said to work miracles after death. He was the first bishop that ever suffered death in England, by a sentence of the civil judge; and the pope was so much incensed at this infringement of ecclesiastical li∣berty, that he excommunicated all who were concerned in his death and con∣demnation. Mowbray earl mareschal suffered in the same manner, without arraignment, trial, or defence; and heavy fines were imposed upon the rest who had been engaged in the insurrection. The lands and castles belonging to the earl of Northumberland and the lord Bardolfe were confiscated; and all the military tenants of the crown summoned to meet at Newcastle, from whence the king proposed to march in person, and undertake the siege of Berwick. Before he approached the place, the two noblemen had fled to Scotland, leaving the command of the town to Sir William Greystock, who was well prepared for a vigorous defence. But one of the towers being demo∣lished by the shot from a large piece of cannon, the garrison was so intimi∣dated, that he was obliged to surrender the place without farther resistance: Warkworth, Alnwick, and the earl's other castles in that country, were re∣duced with equal ease by Henry, who, having quelled the commotions of the north, directed his arms against Owen Glendourdwy, by this time<NOTE PLACE="marg">W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>singham<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</NOTE> ren∣dered more and more formidable by his French alliance.

Henry began his march <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the north, in order to stop the progress of those invaders; but he was retarded in such a manner by bad weather, that, before he arrived in the Marches of Wales, the French auxi∣liaries were embarked, and the season so far advanced, that he could under∣take nothing of consequence against Owen, who found means to intercept fifty waggons, laden with provisions and money for the subsistence of the army. This misfortune hastened his retreat towards London, where he applied to the bishops for a fresh supply, which was granted in the next convocation.</P>

<P>The contract between Henry and the Scots was managed by the duke of Albany, brother to Robert III. king of Scotland, who, having designs upon the crown to the prejudice of his nephews, maintained a friendly corr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spondence with Henry, who he hoped would assist him in his usurpation. Robert was a prince of su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> weak intellects, and so slothful and irresolute, that the duke of Albany had already engrossed the whole administration, and gained such an ascendancy over the king, that the simple monarch durst not avow his sentiments on those subjects that most nearly concerned the interest of his own family. The duke, on pretence of some irregularities, had extorted an order from Robert to confine his eldest son David prince of Scotland in the castle of Falkland, where that unhappy prince was starved to death by his inhuman uncle. The father being apprised of this tragedy, and afraid of taking ven∣geance upon the perfidious actor, resolved to remove his other son James with∣out the reach of Albany's influence, and sent him on board of a ship to be con∣veyed to France for his education. This young prince, who had attained the fourteenth year of his age, was provided with two tutors, whom the father f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnished with letters of recommendation, not only to the French ministry, but also to Henry king of England, in ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the prince should be driven into any part of his territories by stress of weather. James being very much incommo∣ded by the nausea, to which many people are subject at sea, was set ashore on the coast of Norfolk. There he was immediately apprehended and brought to Henry, who committed him prisoner to the Tower, in violation of the truce that full sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed between the two nations; and of the rites of hospitality, to the benefit of which he was pathetically recommended by his unhappy father.

Mean while the city of London was afflicted with a dreadful plague, that swept off vast numbers of the inhabi∣tants; and the king, in order to avoid the contagion, resided in the castle of Ledes in Kent. Having passed part of the summer in this habitation, he re∣solved to visit another country-house in Norfolk by sea, and went on board of a small vessel, attended by four ships loaded with his baggage and domestics. In this short voyage he was attacked by the French cruisers, who took all his servants and equipage, while he himself escaped with the utmost difficulty, not without suspecting that he had been betrayed by some of his domestics. This year is likewise remarkable for the death of the famous Sir Robert Knolles, who had acquired so much military reputation in the reign of Edward III. and now died in Kent in extreme old age, after having lived in private many years, universally esteemed and beloved for his humanity and benevolence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham.</NOTE></P>

<P>Henry's affairs had been so situated since his accession to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The duke of Orleans, who had all along treated Henry with the most provoking insolence, made another fruitless attempt upon Bourg and Blaye, while the duke of Burgundy renewed his scheme of besieging Calais. He did not venture, however, to en∣gage in this enterprize; and loudly complained that the duke of Orleans had wilfully thrown obstacles in the way of his design. The quarrel between these two princes of the blood proceeded to such a degree of rancour, that Orleans was assassinated by the emissaries of Burgundy, who avowed the murder with impunity, although the defunct was the king's own brother. The death of the duke of Orleans, who had encouraged and protected the Bretons in their hostilities against the English, alarmed that people with apprehensions of their being left at the mercy of England, in case an accommodation should be effect∣ed between the two crowns; they therefore willingly listened to Henry's pro∣posal of a truce for one year, before the expiration of which they thought they should be able to judge of the system of politics which the French court would pursue. Henry was not ignorant of their views, though he dissembled his sen∣timents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

He concluded at this period, a treaty of commerce with the duke of Burgundy and the states of Flanders; and in October convened a parliament at Glou∣cester, where he demanded a subsidy which introduced an inquiry into the ap∣plication of the last aid granted in parliament. Warm debates arose on this subject; and the king's conduct was censured with great freedom. But at length they granted a subsidy, though upon express condition that he would not demand another aid for two years, nor load the subjects with any new charge or imposition. Henry received it on these terms; and copies of the statute were delivered to the members, that they might exhibit them in their respective counties. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

For this purpose, they went thither and as∣sembled a large number of troops, which were reinforced by a body of Scot∣tish freebooters, and retook several castles which the king had reduced after the battle of Shrewsbury. Henry was no sooner informed of these proceedings, than he summoned his military tenants, resolving to march in person against the rebels, who having advanced as far as Thirsk in the North-Riding of York∣shire, published a mani<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esto, declaring their intention was to redress the grie∣vances of the nation, and inviting all its well-wishers to join them in such a laudable undertaking. They were accordingly joined by great numbers of the country people, ill armed and totally ignorant of discipline, who committed terrible outrages in their march, and proceeded in the utmost disorder. Sir Thomas Rokeby sheriff of Yorkshire, knowing the king was in full march against them with a considerable army, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmoned the freeholders of the county, with their vassals, and took possession of the pass of Knaresborough, which they would not attempt to force; but turning off towards Wolherby, continued their route to Tadcaster, from whence they marched to Braham-Moor, where the earl drew them up in order of battle. The sheriff followed them at some distance, in order to watch their motions; and being joined in his march by a consider∣able number of gentlemen in the neighbourhood, resolved to give the rebels battle without further hesitation. The earl of Northumberland was prepared for the attack; his followers, however, did not long sustain the onset. The engagement began with great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury on both sides; but the rebel army, consist∣ing either of raw undisciplined people irregularly armed, or such as served in hope of plunder, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re soon broken and routed, in spite of all the efforts of the earl o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Northumberland, who was killed on the field o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> battle.

<P>After the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat and death of the earl of Northumberland, Owen Glendourdwy's affairs declined apace. Prince Henry was so active and successful in his operations, that, in the course of this year, he completed the
<PB N="239" REF="2410"/>
conquest of South-Wales, and reduced Harlech in Merionethshire; so that Owen was in a manner besieged in Snowdun, where he was greatly straitened for subsistence. From thence he detached part of his troops to ravage Shrop∣shire, under the command of Rees Du and Philpot Scudamore, his two best officers, who were defeated, taken, and executed at London. As Owen's fortune began to change, he was gradually forsaken by the best part of his adherents, who submitted, and were pardoned by prince Henry. He himself might have enjoyed the same indulgence, could he have stooped to such sub∣mission: but he chose rather to lead the remainder of his life as an independent vagrant, shifting from place to place, than to purchase safety and ease at the expence of freedom. For two years he led this wandering life, sometimes at the head of a party, and sometimes quite solitary; and at last died at his daughter's house in Herefordshire, where he was entertained in the disguise of a shepherd. The success of Henry's arms was not limited to England and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1409.</NOTE> Wales. The commerce of the kingdom having been greatly distressed by the pyrates of Brittany, the king sent the earl of Kent, with a strong squadron, against the town of Brehac, which was the chief nest of those corsairs. That nobleman attacked the place with great gallantry; but the Bretons made such a vigorous attempt, that he was repulsed, after having received a wound in his head which proved mortal. The English, enraged at the death of their commander, gave another assault with such fury, that they carried the place, put all who were found in arms to the sword, and brought the rest as prisoners to England.</P>

<P>The schism in the church still continuing, through a succession of popes and antipopes, the princes of Christendom, in order to abolish a con∣test which reflected disgrace upon religion, and exposed all Europe to number∣less inconveniencies and vexations, prevailed upon the cardinals of each party to convoke a general council at Pisa, to which Benedict XIII. and Gregory XII. the competitors for the papacy, were summoned to make good their pretensions. As they did not think proper to appear, the council declared them perjured heretics, and stripped them both of the pontifical dignity, which they assumed. At the same time the cardinals being empowered to chuse a new pontiff, elected Peter Philargi, a Candiot, who took the name of Alex∣ander V.

Then he demanded a subsidy to defray the expence of the government; and the commons took this occasion to renew their address against the clergy. The majority of that house leaned towards Lollardism; and therefore they presented two addresses to his majesty: in one of which they represented, that the clergy made a bad use of their wealth, converting it to purposes widely different from those for which it was intended by the ori∣ginal donors: that their revenues, being sufficient to maintain one hundred and fifty earls, fifteen hundred barons, six thousand two hundred knights, and one hundred hospitals, ought to be appropriated to these uses; in which case the kingdom would be in a better posture of defence, the poor more comfortably supported, and the clergy more attentive to their duty. In the other address, the commons petitioned that the act passed against the Lollards might be repealed, or at least mitigated, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase of the subject. Henry, being no longer over-awed by the fear of intestine trouble and foreign inva∣sion, began to discover that arbitrary disposition which he had hitherto endea∣voured to conceal. Instead of complying as formerly with the demands of his commons, he replied, with great severity, that he neither would nor could consent to their petitions, and peremptorily forbade them to meddle for the future with the affairs of the church: not that he had the least regard for the clergy, but he chose to espouse their interest in opposition to the commons, whom he was resolved to humble. With regard to the Lollards, he said, that far from assenting to the repeal of the act, he wished that a more rigo∣rous statute might be passed, in order to extirpate such an execrable heresy. The commons, disappointed in this hope, demanded that clerks, accused of felony or other crimes, might not be judged in courts of ecclesiastical judica∣ture, because daily experience proved that such malefactors always escaped the punishment they deserved to undergo. This request was likewise rejected by Henry, who affected upon this occasion an extraordinary zeal for the ec∣clesiastical interest. He seemed bent upon mortifying the commons; for, though he knew they were in general favourers of Wickliff's tenets, he signed a death-warrant against one Bodby, a taylor, who had exclaimed against the doctrine of the real presence in the sacrament. That poor fanatic was brought to the stake; and, when the fire began to consume his body, uttered such dismal shrieks and exclamations, that the prince of Wales, who was present at the execution, commanded the fire to be extinguished. When the mise∣rable victim recollected his spirits, the prince offered to procure his pardon, and allow him a pension for life, if he would recant: but he refused to live upon such terms; and, the fire being re-kindled, died a martyr to his persuasion. The commons considered the execution of this man as an out∣rageous aggravation of the refusal they had already sustained; and seized the first opportunity to manifest their resentment. When the king demanded permission to levy a certain yearly subsidy, even though the parliament should not be assembled, they rejected the proposal with marks of asperity; nor would they have granted a subsidy for the occasions of the state, had not he repeated his former expedient of detaining them until they were tired into<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> compliance.</P>

<P>In the course of this year, the truce with Scotland expiring, hosti∣lities were renewed on the borders, and the Scottish cruizers interrupted the navigation and trade of the English. In order to chastise these adventurers, Robert de Humpreville, vice-admiral of England, entered the Frith of Edin∣burgh, with ten capital ships, and not only destroyed the whole naval force of Scotland, but ravaged the whole coast; from whence he brought off such a booty in goods, corn, and cattle, as removed the horrors of a dearth in the north of England; where he acquired the appellation of Robert Mendmarket. At the same time Sir John Pendergrace and William Long were sent to sea, with a fleet to act against the French corsairs, of which they effectually scoured the channel: but, whether they had entered into some private engagement with Henry touching the prizes, which agreement they did not observe; or offended him in some other particulars of their conduct; he issued a warrant to arrest Pendergrace when he came ashore; and that officer was obliged to take sanctuary in the porch of Westminster Abbey, where he was sur∣rounded by a guard of soldiers, and continued for some time, until he thought proper to throw himself upon the mercy of the king, who committed him to prison. Thomas Beaufort, admiral of England, was sent with a squadron in pursuit of Long, who would not submit until he had obtained a capitula∣tion, by which he was exempted from all prosecution.</P>

After this prince had effected the assassination of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

While he was employed in making preparations for this war, the dutchess of Orleans, with her three sons, went to the French court, and, throwing themselves at the king's feet, demanded justice against the murderer of his brother. Although the duke of Burgundy had obtained his pardon for this murder, his enemies had such credit at court, that the pardon was revoked, and he was declared an enemy to the state. Mean while the duke marched against the Liegeois, over whom he obtained a complete victory, which was no sooner known at Paris, than his adversaries left that city, where he had a great number of partisans, and retired to Tours with the king, who was not in a condition to regulate his own conduct. The duke of Burgundy, being informed of these transactions, set out immediately at the head of four thousand horse for Paris, where he was received with triumphal honours; and the citizens, at his desire, sent deputies to the king, to request that he would return to their city. Charles, who happened to be in one of his lucid intervals, declared that he would not countenance the ene∣mies of the duke of Burgundy; and, returning immediately to Paris, em∣ployed some of the most considerable persons of the state to mediate an ac∣commodation between that prince and the children of his brother the duke of Orleans. With great difficulty they succeeded in their endeavours: the young duke of Orleans, who had just attained the sixteenth year of his age, found himself obliged to be reconciled to his most mortal enemy; and his

<P>Henry of England, having always at heart an alliance with France, resolved i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possible to effect a match between the prince of Wales and one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the duke of Burgundy; but this prince was not so well established as the king of England imagined. The dukes of Berry, Or∣leans, Alen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and Brittany, with the counts of Clermont and Armagnac, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mbling at G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, formed an association against the duke of Burgundy, and advanced at the head of an army towards Paris. Their antagonist, who had the king in his power, assembled a body of forces, and prepared for their re∣ception; but both sides seemed averse to a battle, which must have been fatal to France, whatever party might have obtained the victory. Measures were there∣fore taken for an accommodation, which was concluded, on condition that the duke of Burgundy should quit Paris; that the confederates should not enter <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> nor any chief of either <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>action repair to court, unless commanded to give his attendance, by letters under the great seal. The duke of Burgundy, in conformity with this agreement, retired to the Low Countries; but the confederates did not act with the same scrupulous integrity: the other was no sooner arrived in his own territories, than they levied another army, and ap∣proached Paris, in hope of enriching themselves with the plunder of that city, which was of the Burgundian faction. The place was accordingly invested; and the duke, finding himself duped by the perfidy of his enemies, imme∣diately concluded an alliance with the king of England, who sent a consider∣able body of archers to his assistance. Thus reinforced, the duke began his march; but the Flemings and Picards, who composed his army, quarrelling after he had reduced the town of Ham, dispersed and returned to their own habitations; so that the duke found himself abandoned by all but the English auxiliaries, under the earl of Arundel, amounting to eight hundred men at arms and one thousand bowmen. With these he proceeded to Paris, the blockade of which had been some time formed by the duke of Orleans; and, forcing his way through the quarters of the enemy, entered the city, amidst the acclamations of the people. As the English troops were not very agree∣able to the inhabitants, who looked upon them through the mist of national prejudice, the duke resolved to employ his auxiliaries in action, not doubting but their exploits would soon reconcile them to the Parisians. On the very next day after their arrival, he ordered them to attack the important posts of Montma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tre and La Chappelle, from which they drove the enemy with great slaughter; and, in a few days after this atchievement, they attacked St. Cloud, which was defended by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ri and Bournonville, two officers of equal courage and experience, at the head of the best troops in France: and, notwithstand∣ing all the endeavours of the defendants, the English, supported by a body of Picards and Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ans, carried on the assault with such irresistible fury, that the place was taken, about nine hundred gentlemen were put to the sword, and a great number taken prisoners. The loss of these places obliged the duke of Orleans to raise the blockade of Paris, and retire towards the provinces, where his troops dispersed. After his retreat, the duke of Burgundy reduced all the castles and fortresses in the Isle of France, which had been seized by the

Then they petitioned that a general am∣nesty, under the great seal, might be passed in favour of all his majesty's subjects; and the king complied with their request: excepting no persons from this act of grace but Owen Glendourdwy, with his confederates, and those who were guilty of rape or murder. In consideration of this conces∣sion, the commons granted a subsidy for the occasions of the king; and some regulations were made touching the reformation of the coin, which had been notoriously adulterated. Upon this occasion his three sons, John, Thomas, and Humphrey, were created dukes of Clarence, Bedford, and Gloucester; and Henry's own brother was made earl of Dorset.</P>

<P>Charles <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of France, recovering the use of his intellects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1412.</NOTE> de∣clared warmly in favour of the duke of Burgundy, and removed all the great officers of state, who had been engaged in the faction of Orleans, known by the name of Armagnacs, from the count of that denomination. The duke of Burgundy, thus strengthened by the whole interest of the royal fa∣mily, and the favour of the Parisians, began to treat his English auxiliaries with indifference, and evade the consummation of the match between his daughter and the prince of Wales, which had been stipulated in his treaty of alliance with Henry. The chiefs of the Armagnac faction being well apprised of these circumstances, and presuming upon the resentment of Henry towards the duke, who had thus made a tool of him for his own purposes, resolved to gain him over to their interest, in hope that an alliance with England would throw the ballance in their favour. Having assembled at Bourges, where they deliberated on this subject, they sent deputies to treat with Henry, and make such offers as were likely to detach him from the Burgundian fac∣tion. The duke no sooner was informed of this negotiation, than he sent ambassadors to press the conclusion of the marriage-contract, which he had hitherto eluded; and Henry pretended to receive the proposal with pleasure: but this affectation was no more than a feint, calculated to extort more advantageous terms from the faction of Armagnac; and it was attended with the desired effect. The envoys of that confederacy no longer hesitated in com∣plying with all his demands; and the treaty was concluded on the following terms: The confederate princes engaged to deliver into the hands of the Eng∣lish king fifteen hundred towns, castles, or bailliages, which they possessed in Guienne and Poitou: To conquer for him all the rest of these provinces that remained under the dominion of France; so that he should enjoy Guienne and its dependencies in the same manner as it was formerly enjoyed by his predecessors. On the other hand, Henry agreed that the duke of Berry should possess Poitou for life, on condition of doing homage for it to the king of England, and surrendering to him in the mean time the towns of Poitiers, Niort, and Lusignan. As for the other places, the duke was per∣mitted to appoint governors, who should bind themselves by oath to give

<P>Henry had now survived all his troubles; and the kingdom of England enjoyed the most profound tranquility. He had nothing to fear <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom France, distracted by its own intestine divisions; the Welsh sued for peace; the regent of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otland dreaded a rupture with England, lest Henry should send home the king, who was his prisoner; and the malecontents in England were too inconsiderable to attempt any thing further against the go∣vernment. During this calm, the king endeavoured to efface the impressions o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> severity, which his conduct had made upon the people, by affecting a popu∣larity and regard for the welfare of the subject, which never fails to conciliate the aff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of the English in favour of their sovereign. While he thus la∣boured, not without s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccess, to retrieve the reputation he had lost, his son the prince of Wales seemed b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt upon incurring the public aversion.

Nevertheless, in the midst
<PB N="245" REF="2470"/>
of these excesses, the nobleness of his heart seemed every now and then to emerge from the torrent by which it was overwhelmed. One of his dissolute companions having been brought to trial for some misdemeanor, was con∣demned, notwithstanding all the interest he could make in his favour; and he was so exasperated at the issue of the trial, that he struck the judge upon the bench. This magistrate, whose name was Sir William Gascoigne, behaved with the dignity that became his office; he forthwith ordered the prince to be committed to prison: and young Henry, by this time conscious of the flagrant insult he had offered to the laws of his country, suffered himself to be quietly conducted to goal by the officers of justice. When this transaction was re∣ported to the king, who was an excellent judge of mankind, he could not help exclaiming, in a transport of joy, <Q>“Happy is the king who has a magistrate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon such an offender; and still more happy in having a son who will submit to such chastisement.”</Q> Henry was naturally jealous of the least shadow of competition, and therefore lent an ear to officious parasites, who insinuated that the prince had an evil design upon his crown and authority. Such insinuations filled his breast with anxiety; and perhaps he might have proceeded to some extremities, in order to ascertain his own security, had not all his suspicion been dispelled by the prudent step which the prince took, as soon as he was made acquainted with the jealousy of his father. He repaired to the king's court in a strange habit, invented as an emblem of the sorrow and anxiety of his heart. Demanding a private au∣dience of the king, he threw himself on his knees, and accosted him to this effect. <Q>“I understand, my liege, that you suspect me of harbouring designs to the prejudice of your crown and person. I have indeed been guilty of excesses, for which I have justly merited your displeasure; but I take heaven to wit∣ness, that I never entertained a thought repugnant to that duty and venera∣tion I owe your majesty.

<P>Henry did not long outlive this interview. He was seized with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This ma∣lady co-operating with scruples of conscience, touching the means he had used to ascend the throne, and an idle prophecy importing that he should die in Je∣rusalem, disposed his mind to the duties of devotion; and he took the cross with full resolution to consecrate the remaining part of his life to a war against the infidels. He imparted his design to a great council assembled for that pur∣pose; and began to make preparations for the expedition, when his disorder encreased to such a degree, that he was obliged to lay aside his intention, and think of a voyage which seemed to be of greater importance. As his constitution de∣cayed, his fears of losing the crown redoubled, even to a childish anxiety. He
<PB N="246" REF="2480"/>
would not sleep unless the royal diadem was placed by his pillow. One day he continued so long in a swoon, that his attendants believed he was actually dead, and the prince of Wales conveyed the crown into his own apartment. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g recovering the use of his senses, and perceiving the crown was removed, asked who had prefumed to take it from his pillow; and understanding the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had carried it away, ordered him to be brought immediately into his presence. When young Henry appeared, "What!" said the king, with marks o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnation, "would you rob me of my dignity before my death." "No," replied the prince, <Q>“thinking your majesty was dead, I took the crown as my lawful inheritance; but now I see you alive, I restore it with much more pleasure; and may God grant you many happy days to enjoy it in peace.”</Q> So laying, he placed the crown upon the pillow, and having received his father's blessing, retired. The king was surprized by his last fit, at his devotions be∣fore the shrine of St. Edward the Confessor in Westminster-Abbey, from w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence he was carried to Jerusalem Chamber. When he recovered from his swoon, and perceived himself in a strange place, he desired to know if the apartment had any particular name, and being informed of its appellation, con∣cluded that his last hour approached, and that he should die, according to the prophecy, in Jerusalem. In this sentiment, he desired to see the prince of Wales, whom he enriched with some wholesome advice touching his govern∣ment: though he could not help expressing great uneasiness, with respect to his own usurpation; as well as concerning the duke of Clarence, who he seemed to think would dispute the succession with Henry. The prince of Wales pro∣mised to keep his exhortations e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>graven on his heart, and desired he would make himself easy on account of the duke of Clarence; for if that prince should be∣have according to the dictates of his duty, he might expect to be treated with brotherly affection; but should he endeavour to disturb the lineal succession, he, the prince, would punish him according to his demerit. The king seemed to be well pleased with Henry's resolution; and having recommended him to the protection of heaven, expired on the twentieth day of March, in the forty∣sixth year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign. Henry IV. was of the middle stature, well proportioned, and perfect in all the exercises of arms and chivalry: his countenance was severe rather than serene; and his disposition four, sullen, and reserved: he possessed a great share of courage, fortitude, and penetration; was naturally imperious, though he bridled his temper with cau∣tion; superstitious, though without the least tincture of virtue and true reli∣gion; and meanly parsimonious, though justly censured for want of oeconomy, and ill-judged profusion. He was tame from caution, humble from fear, cruel from<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> policy, and rapacious from indigence. He rose to the throne by perfidy and trea∣son; established his authority in the blood of his subjects; and died a penitent for his sins because he could no longer enjoy the fruits of his transgression <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During this reign, William of Wickham bishop of Winchester, Sir Robert Kr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es, and Richard Whittington mayor of London, distin∣guished themselves for their works of charity and public foundations.

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>THE death of Henry IV. would have been very little regretted at any juncture by the English, among whom he was far from being popular: but now it was the more agreeable as the prince of Wales was their darling, notwithstanding all the extravagance and profligacy of his youth, through which they had already discovered the dawn of great and good qua∣lities. This prince, who was called Henry of Monmouth from the place of his birth, had been educated at Oxford under the eye of his uncle the bishop of Winchester, who was chancellor of that university. We have already seen how early in life he distinguished his valour and military capacity, in the battle of Shrewsbury and the war with Owen Glendourdwy, over whose troops he ob∣tained two successive victories. His father seems to have been jealous of his talents and growing reputation; and for that reason to have put a stop to his warlike atchievements, and excluded him from all share in the council or ad∣ministration. It was in this recess from more important avocations, that his busy genius, rather than be inactive, hurried him into those scenes of debauchery which in some measure tarnished his reputation; though they did not much misbecome a prince of his youth and vivacity. Immediately after his father's death, he was proclaimed by the name of Henry V. to the general satisfaction of the nation; and the parliament meeting on the twenty-fourth day of March, offered to take the oath of allegiance even before his coronation; a proposal which he modestly declined, as an instance of their confidence which he did not deserve. He was crowned, on the ninth day of April, by the archbishop of Canterbury, and began his reign in such a manner, as captivated the hearts of his new subjects. He published a general amnesty for all crimes, except murder and rape. He discarded all the dissolute companions of his youth, after having exhorted them to amend their lives, and provided for their subsistence. He chose a new coun∣cil, consisting of the wisest and best men of the realm: he reformed the benches, by dismissing unqualified judges, and filling their places with persons of courage, knowledge, and integrity. The same care extended to inferior magis∣trates and vacant benefices, to which he preferred none but ecclesiastics of known worth and unblemished morals. He expressed the utmost concern for the misfortunes of Richard, whose corpse he ordered to be removed from Langley to Westminster-Abbey, where it was deposited by his queen Anne of Luxemburg with great funeral solemnity, at which Henry assisted in person: he even acted the part of chief mourner on this occasion; and afterwards, by way of attonement for his father's usurpation, he founded three monasteries near Shene in Surrey, where prayers were continually preferred for the soul of Richard. He released Edmund earl of Marche, who had been detained in custody during the preceding reign; and treated him with such benevolence,
<PB N="249" REF="2510"/>
as won the heart of that young nobleman, who served him with the utmost fidelity. Henry likewise expressed a noble pity for the sufferings of the Piercy family; and invited the son and heir of Hotspur to come from Scotland, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham. Evesham.</NOTE> he might be restored to the honours and estate of his ancestors.</P>

<P>Though never prince ascended the throne under more favourable auspices, he could not escape the envy and hatred of some individuals. A con∣spiracy was formed against him by means of one Wightlock, who endeavoured to soment a rebellion by means of papers that were fixed up in all public places, containing affirmations that Richard was still alive. This incendiary being ap∣prehended was committed prisoner to the Tower, from whence he escaped, by the connivance of the constable Edmund duke of York, who was supposed to have projected the conspiracy. That nobleman was dismissed from his office; and one of the warders, convicted of having favoured the prisoner's escape, was executed as a traitor. The lieutenant of the Tower was mulcted in a thousand marks for his negligence; and indictments were found against several persons of distinction. But Henry, who despised the authors of this attempt too much to think them worthy of revenge, imposed slight fines upon some, and sup∣pressed all the other prosecutions.</P>

<P>The session of parliament, which met on the fifteenth day of May, was opened with a speech by the bishop of Winchester the king's uncle, who assured them of Henry's zeal to promote the interest of church and state. The commons having chosen William Stourton for their speaker, presented an ad∣dress, desiring that the laws might be duly executed, and the grievances of the nation redressed. Then they petitioned that his majesty would provide for the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of Ireland, Wales, the Marches of Scotland, Calais, and Guienne. They afterwards granted a subsidy of wool and leather for four years, together with the tonnage and poundage for one year, and a fifteenth and an half, ex∣pressing their hope of being soon eased of such taxes and tailliages by his wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ad∣ministration. They complained loudly of the clergy's exacting pecuniary<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl.</NOTE> commutations; and the king promised to interpose with the bishops, that these abuses might be reformed. Several statutes were enacted for the better preser∣vation of the public peace, and the maintenance of the people's privil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges; and one in particular calculated for preventing frauds and false returns, in the election for members of parliament.</P>

<P>While the commons were thus employed in making wholesome regu∣lations for the public welfare, the convocation of the clergy was held by Tho∣mas Arundel archbishop of Canterbury, who had obtained from the late king an order to appoint commissioneres in Oxford to take informations concerning the doctrines of the Wickli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ites. The archbishop now communicated the result of their inquiries to the convocation, which, after some debates, unanimously agreed, that there was no other way of extirpating the heresy of the Lollards, but that of making examples of the principal favourers of their doctrine: that John Oldcastle baron of Cobham, was the most considerable protector of this pernicious sect; that in order to strike terror into the rest, it would be neces∣sary to begin with him, against whom they desired that a process might be im∣mediately instituted. As this nobleman was a person of great consideration with Henry, whose esteem he had acquired by his valour and military experience, the archbishop would not begin the prosecution, until he had first obtained the
<PB N="250" REF="2520"/>
king's permission; and this he did not obtain, till after his majesty had expo∣stulated with Oldcastle in private, and found him unshaken in his principles. Henry himself was a zealot for the established religion, and so exasperated at the inflexibility of Cobham, that he withdrew all the regard he had hitherto professed for that Lollard, and allowed the ecclesiastical courts to proceed against him with the utmost rigour Oldcastle was so extremely popular among t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e people of his own persuasion, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere generally enthusiastic fanatics, that they ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laimed against the king as an oppressor, and did not even refrain from denouncing vengeance against him and his government. These clamours and menaces were repeated to the king by the clergy with such exaggerations, that his aversion to their principles increased; and he began to look upon them as enemies both to the church and state in England. Lord Cobham being con∣victed and condemned by the archbishop, was delivered over to the secular arm, but found means to escape from the Tower; and it was generally believed he intended to put himself at the head of the Lollards, and bid defiance to the government.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>Henry published a proclamation against their conventicles, forbidding them under <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evere penalties, and prohibiting all persons from embracing their opinions, favouring their sect, or preaching without a licence from the bishop of the diocese. They were exasperated at this prohibition; and, in papers fixed upon the church-doors of London, not only complained of it as an act of persecution, but also declared they were both able and willing to repel force by force. Oldcastle himself was now ripe for revolt, and actually began to make preparations for unhinging the constitution. He sent emissaries to all parts of the kingdom to reconcile the sectaries to the scheme he had projected. By means of Sir Roger Acton, John Brown esquire, Sir John Beverely a preacher, one Murle a rich brewer of Dunstable, and the precentor of St Alban's, a great number of people were inflamed to his wish, and promised to appear in arms at the rendezvous, which was fixed in St. Gile's fields, where they generally assembled to worship. This place was deemed the more proper, on account of its vicinity to the court, and to the city of London, from which they ex∣pected to be joined by a vast number of apprentices. Henry, who resided at Eltham in Kent, was duly informed of every circumstance of their design, and took his precautions accordingly. He ordered a good body of soldiers to march in small parties towards Westminster, where they had directions to assemble on the night appointed for the rendezvous of the Lollards. When the day ar∣rived, he commanded the mayor to shut the city gates, and posted guards at all the avenues, to prevent all egress: then he detached parties to scour the country, while he himself marched with his banner displayed to St. Giles's fields, at that time covered with heath and furze, among which he found an inconsiderable number of the Lollards lying concealed in arms. Some of these were immediately put to the sword, and the rest taken prisoners. Among these, Acton, Brown, and Beverley were apprehended, and suffered death as heretics and traitors, together with six and thirty of their followers. A good number was s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain by the scouring parties, before they could join their brethren. Many were executed in other parts of the kingdom; and Cobham, who did<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngham.</NOTE> not appear on this occasion, was outlawed and proscribed.

<P>Having thus given a detail of a commotion which has been dif∣ferently related by different historians, it will be necessary to explain the situa∣tion of affairs in France, as an introduction to that war which continued so long, and was so productive of mischief and calamity to both nations. Charles VI. of France had three sons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> namely, Lewis, John, and Charles. The first of these, distinguished by the appellation of Dauphin and duke of Guienne, was a worthless prince, plunged in all manner of debauchery, and inspired with the most arbitrary principles of despotic power. He was now about six∣teen years of age, when, by the advice of his favourites, he resolved to de∣prive the duke of Burgundy of the management of affairs, which that prince wholly ingrossed during the distemper of Charles, and to take into his hands the reins of the administration. For this purpose, he bribed the governor of the Bastile to surrender that fortress, which he entrusted to one of his own adherents. But the Parisians, who adored the duke of Burgundy, took to their arms, and assembled to the number of twelve thousand men, in support of their favourite. This body being formed in two divisions, one half, com∣manded by a surgeon, repaired to the dauphin's palace, which they forced, and dragged twenty persons to prison, as evil counsellors, by whom he had been misled; the other party investing the Bastile, the new governor was so terrified that he surrendered without opposition; and the duke of Burgundy saw his administration re-established. The inhabitants of Paris, intoxicated with their success, distinguished themselves by white hoods or caps, and obliged not only the dauphin, but even the king himself, to wear this badge of dis∣tinction. John de Troye the surgeon, at the head of his insurgents, repaired to court, and regardless of all the intreaties of the dauphin and king, seized a good number of courtiers of both sexes, who were instantly committed to prison. Among these was Lewis of Bavaria the queen's own brother, and many other persons of distinction. Charles was fain to yield to the torrent, and pass whatever edicts they were pleased to demand. The dauphin finding himself thus enslaved by the seditious multitude, or rather by his father-in-law the duke of Burgundy, who privately actuated the machine, resolved to make an effort to free himself from such disagreeable restraint, and set on foot a ne∣gotiation with the chiefs of the Orleans faction, who had been obliged to sign a peace, by which they were secluded from Paris, and his majesty's coun∣cil. He therefore went to confer with them in person, on pretence of healing up some little breaches which had been made in the peace of Bourges; and after having taken his measures with the confederates, effected a confirmation of the peace, in a new treaty signed at Pontoise, by which they were left at liberty to pay their respects to his majesty.</P>

<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Burgundy, judging from the attempt which the dauphin had already made, that he had nothing to expect from him but animosity and opposition, determined to secure himself by means of an alliance to which he could have recourse in case of necessity; and for this purpose turned his eyes upon the king of England. In the month of June, he sent over an embassy, as count of Flanders, on pretence of renewing the treaty of commerce be∣tween the Flemings and the English; but in reality to propose a league of an∣other nature with Henry, which, however, did not immediately take effect. Before the king of England would conclude an alliance with the duke of Bur∣gundy,
<PB N="252" REF="2540"/>
he was willing to be better acquainted with the real state of the French politics; and for that purpose sent ambassadors to Paris. By their public commission they were empowered to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd, that the court of France would observe the truce with more punctuanty than they had hitherto shewn: that the said truce might be confir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d or renewed; and that all differences between<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch. 1413.</NOTE> the two crowns might be a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on modated.

<P>The affairs of the French court soon assumed another aspect: the dukes of Orleans, Berry, Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbon, A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>çon, the counts of Eu and Vendome, hastened to Paris, in consequence of the permission the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had obtained. The dauphin having gained over a great number <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Parisians to his interest, and finding himself so powerfully supported by the confederates, sent private orders to his partisans to assemble; so that he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound himself at the head of thirty thousand men. With these he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>coured the streets of Paris, and struck such terror into the opposite faction that they abandoned the Louvre, Hotel de Ville, and Bastile, without opposition; and the duke of Burgundy finding himself unable to stop their progress, retired into Flanders. Then the faction of the confederates prevailed at court, and the king being in one of his lucid intervals, conceived such affection for his nephew the duke of Orleans, that he suffered himself to be directed intirely by his counsels; so that the dauphin reaped no advantage from the revolution he had effected. The new minister began his administration with several edicts against the duke of Burgundy, and prosecuted the authors of the former sedition, many of whom were executed as traitors.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>The court of France being thus new-modelled, appointed commissioners to treat with the English plenipotentiaries, and the conferences were opened at Lelinghen in Picardy, where it was immediately agreed that the truce should be inviolably observed till the month of June in the following year: but, in the course of the negotiation, the English ambassadors gave the commissioners of France to understand, that the king their master expected France would restore all she had wrested from England since the peace of Bretigny. The French ministry, alarmed at this dec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aration, as being altogether unprepared for a war, sent the archbishop of Bourges, the constable D'Albret, and the king's secretary, as ambassadors to London, on pretence of facilitating the negotia∣tions at Lelinghen; but in reality to discover the designs of Henry. While these resided in England, the French court continued its prosecutions against the Burgundian party, a great number of which fell by the hands of the com∣mon executioner. Lewis of Anjou king of Sicily, sent back the daughter of the duke of Burgundy, who had been betrothed to his eldest son, and procured a match between one of his own daughters and Charles count of Ponthieu, the third son of the French king, a youth in the thirteenth year of his age. Nothing could be more fatal to France than this marriage. The young prince entered warmly into all the interest and resentment of his father<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in-law. He became a sworn enemy to the duke of Burgundy, who hated him with equal ran∣cour; and their mutual animosity intailed a world of mischief on the unhappy kingdom. The dauphin could not without great chagrin behold the duke of Orleans at the helm of government, while he himself, by whose means that
<PB N="253" REF="2550"/>
nobleman had been promoted, remained, without power or credit, a kind of prisoner in the Louvre, where his conduct was narrowly observed by the mi∣nister. Such restraint was altogether insupportable to a prince of his cha∣racter; and therefore he lent a wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling year to the proposals of the duke of Burgundy, who offered to assist him with all his power, in acquiring that influence and importance to which he was intitled by his birth and expecta∣tions. They engaged in a secret alliance, with design to drive the duke of Orleans from the administration: and Burgundy assembled an army, with which he advanced towards the capital. His pretext was, that he came to deliver his son-in-law the dauphin from captivity; and he hoped that Paris would declare in his favour. But the ministry took such measures as pre∣vented all commotion; and the king issued a declaration against the duke of Burgundy, in which he treated him as a traitor, and enemy to his country. Thus disappointed, the duke desisted from his enterprize, and returned to Flanders to wait for a more favourable opportunity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>The archbishop of Bourges, and the constable D'Albret, soon per∣ceived that Henry of England had resolved to make his advantage of the troubles of France, by means of his alliance with the duke of Burgundy; and, in order to divert him from his purpose, proposed a marriage between him and Catherine, daughter of Charles. The proposal seemed to be relished by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1414.</NOTE> English court; though Henry still insisted upon the restitution of all that had been taken from England since the peace of Bretigny; and as the ambassadors had not powers sufficient to treat upon that subject, all the effect of their ne∣gotiation was a prolongation of the truce. Immediately after their return to France, Henry sent thither five plenipotentiaries to continue the treaty of marriage and restitution. These envoys were afterwards reinforced by the bishop of Norwich, the earls of Dorset, Warwick, Salisbury, and the lord Gray. Charles appointed commissioners to treat with them, the chief being his own uncle the duke of Berry. The English ambassa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors at first demanded the whole kingdom of France for king Henry, as the heir of Edward III. But this demand they afterwards waved, with a salvo to the rights of their sove∣reign, and restricted themselves to the following requisitions: namely, that Normandy, Anjou, le Maine, the sovereignty of Flanders and Britanny, all that France possessed in Guienne, all in general that had been yielded to Ed∣ward III<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the treaty of Bretigny, and all the country under the French do∣minion, between the Somme and Gravelines, should be ceded to the king of England, to be held by him as paramount, without homage or dependence. Before an answer was made to these demands, the duke of Berry pressed the ambassadors to begin with the marriage, as the most effectual expedient for establishing a solid peace between the two nations: but the English deput<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es would not consider the match as the foundation, but rather as the appendage of the treaty. After warm debates, and much altercation, the ambassadors re∣duced their demands to the three following articles; upon which they demanded a categorical answer before they would proceed with the negotiation. They de∣ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded all that had been ceded to England by the peace of Bretigny: the half of Provence, with the counties of Beaufo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and Nogent; and six hundred thousand crowns that remained unpayed of king John's ransom. With re∣gard to the marriage, they plainly declared that the king their master would
<PB N="254" REF="2560"/>
never marry the princess Catherine, unless a firm and durable peace could be previously estab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hed between the two crowns; and even if that should take effect, they hinted that Henry would expect at least two millions as her por∣tion. In a few days after this declaration, the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of Berry delivered a w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting to the ambassadors, containing the following propositions. The king of France is willing to cede to the English monarch the Agenois, the Basa∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, part of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch, Perigord, L'Escarre, Oleron, La Bigorre, Saintonge on the other side of the Charente, all Quercy, except Montauban, with all the country between the Tarn and the Aveiron, Angoumois, and Rouvergne. His majesty cannot dispose of Provence, because it is not in his possession; but a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he is willing, for the sake of peace, to part with so many fair provinces, he hopes the king of England will desist from his demand in this particular. With regard to the marriage; although the portion of the daughters of France was reg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ated at a much smaller sum than that which he had already offered, he would on this occasion augment it to six hundred thousand crowns. These proposals produced a great number of conferences, during which the English again contracted their demands to the treaty of Bretigny, and one million for the portion of Catherine; but the French ministry thinking even these too ex∣orbitant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.</NOTE> the negotiation proved ineffectual.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>During this transaction, Charles was persuaded to declare war against the duke of Burgundy; and, taking the field in person, reduced Soissons and Compiegne, of which the duke had made himself master. That prince was unable to make any resistance, because his Flemish subjects refused to serve against the king of France; so that the duke of Bourbon found no dif∣ficulty in reducing Bapaume: and perhaps the duke of Burgundy might have suffered much more severely, had not Charles relapsed into one of his pa∣roxysms of lunacy, during which the operations were suspended, and Bur∣gundy had time to secure Arras, with a numerous garrison. The dauphin n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook possession of the regency, because there was no other person in the army who had interest enough to dispute his pretensions; and whether he had by this time quarrelled with his father-in-law, or did not think he had further occasion for his alliance, he marched against Arras, and undertook the siege of that city. The place was well provided, and the garrison made a vigorous defence; so that the dauphin found the enterprize more difficult than he ima∣gined it would have proved.

It was stipulated, that he should enjoy the benefit of a pardon, from which, however, five hundred of his adherents were nominally excluded; that all his friends and favourites should be removed from court; that he himself should not presume to go thither without the particular order of the king and council; and that the colours of France should be displayed upon the<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> walls of Arras.</P>

<P>It was at the beginning of this war, that the duke of Burgundy, finding himself very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch embarrassed by the obstinacy of the Flemings, had sent the provost of St. Donas, as an envoy, to renew the treaty he had for∣merly
<PB N="255" REF="2570"/>
begun with Henry king of England. This agent was not only instruc∣ted to conclude an alliance between the king and the duke, but also to treat about Henry's marriage with the princess Catherine, which he promised to effect to the satisfaction of the English monarch, after he should, by his assist∣ance, resume his influence at the court of Charles. His proposals met with a favourable reception from Henry, who still retained his design of profiting by the divisions of France, which he was resolved to invade with a powerful army; foreseeing that he should meet with little opposition in a kingdom di∣vided into two powerful factions, one of which would declare in his favour. He therefore convoked a parliament at Leicester, in order to procure such supplies as would be necessary for the execution of this important enterprize.</P>

<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The commons had not yet laid aside their design of humbling the clergy, though they had already miscarried in two attempts. The proposals they had made for seizing the revenues of that body had been represented to the king as the effects of impious heresy, which had crept in among the mem∣bers, some of whom were professed Lollards; and therefore he had rejected their proposition. But this parliament changed their battery. In order to vindicate themselves from the aspersion of Lollardism, they enacted a severe statute against that sect, importing, that all the magistrates of the kingdom, and all those who exercised public employments, should engage upon oath to use all their endeavours to extermin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te heretics, and assist the bishops in the execution of that pious design. This act was immediately followed by a vio∣lent persecution against the Lollards; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome of whom were committed to the flames; some quitted the kingdom, and others abjured their heresy. As the rolls of parliament were often vitiated, by inserting the petitions of the com∣mons in terms that conveyed a meaning quite different from that which they had intended to express; and as the king and lords for some time past had af∣fected to treat the commons as petitioners only, whose assent was not necessary to any act of the legislature, they now petitioned that no act or statute should pass without their assent; that nothing should be entered on the rolls as their petitions, but in the very terms which they had used; and that the house of commons should, according to their privilege, be declared and established as a constituent part of the legislature. The king having readily given his assent to this petition, the commons concurred with the lords in an unanimous resolution to support his majesty in his war with France; towards the maintenance of which, they intreated him to seize the revenues of the clergy. This unexpected stroke was the more alarming to that venerable body, as the king seemed to lend an ear to the proposal of the commons. After divers consultations upon this important subject, they resolved to give up part of their wealth, in order to secure the remainder; and offered, as a free gift, the whole wealth and revenues of one hundred and ten monasteries of aliens: the king, rather than quarrel with the clergy, agreed to the pro∣posal; and the monasteries were appropriated to his use by act of parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> That his attention might be effectually weaned from a subject, which they did not chuse he should consider, archbishop Chicheley, who had lately suc∣ceeded to the see of Canterbury upon the death of Arundel, composed an elaborate speech, which he pronounced before the king in full parliament, exhorting his majesty to engage in a war with France, for the recovery of the
<PB N="256" REF="2580"/>
crown of that kingdom, which he affirmed to be his lawful inheritance. He pretended to refute the Salique Law, as repugnant to the law of nature and the divine institution. He expatiated upon the present opportunity of assert∣ing his right, while France was distracted by intestine divisions, and England enjoyed the most pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound tranquillity; and assured his majesty, that if he would undertake the war in earnest, the clergy would express their loyalty and zeal for his success, not only in their prayers to heaven, but also in giv∣i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g larger supplies than ever were granted to any of his predecessors. This harrangue, which, in all probability, was directed in private by the king himself, that he might sound the inclinations of his people, met with uni∣versal applause. Henry declared his resolution to undertake the war: the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lergy indulged him with a very extraordinary supply; and the laity, who seemed to vie with them in affection to the cause, granted a subsidy of two whole tenths and as many fifteenths, which amounted to a prodigious sum of money.</P>

<P>The negotiation still continued between the courts of France and England, and ambassadors were continually going and coming between Paris and London. The French ministry hoped to divert Henry from the prosecu∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of his design, by means of the marriage with the princess Catherine; and the king pretended to be amused with their proposals; so that the truce was prolonged from time to time, as if both sides had thought that a pacifi∣cation would ensue: but the real design of both was to gain time, though upon very different motives. The French court could not believe that the son of an usurper, who had been embroiled in such dangerous quarrels and dis∣sensions with his own subjects, should be all at once so firmly established on the throne, but that some new disturbance would employ him in his own do∣minions; and that in the mean time all the differences among the princes of France might be compromised in such a manner, that they would heartily unite in defence of the nation. Henry, on the other hand, protracted the ne∣gotiation, that he might be prepared to strike the meditated blow, immediately after the conferences should break up, and before France should be in a con∣dition to oppose his progress. The French ministry itself was divided on the subject of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e negotiations: the duke of Berry was sincerely disposed to an accommodation with England upon equitable terms; but the dauphin was ex∣tremely averse to any terms that would dismember the dominions of France. He had conceived a very mean opinion of Henry's character from the report of his ind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cretion and excess during the life of his father; and, when he de∣manded the crow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of France by his ambassadors, sent him a cask of tennis balls in der<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion, as a present that implied his being better calcu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated for that diversion, than for the maintenance of a war upon which the fate of kingdoms would depend. Henry was p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qued at this sar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astic compliment; in answer to which, he declared, that when his balls sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld be matched with racquets, he would play a game that would shake the walls of the Louvre. The dauphin soon changed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is opin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of Henry's talents, when he perceived with what art and management he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rried on his negotiations; and with what vigour, ca∣pacity, and perseverance, he pursued the important design which he had pro∣jected. A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>med at the resolutions of the parliament of Leicester, and the preparations which Henry had begun to make for the prosecution of the war,
<PB N="257" REF="2590"/>
he, with the advice of the council, sent over the secretary Col, with new of∣fers, which he hoped would be accepted as a full and final satisfaction; but he was disappointed in his expectation. Henry, finding himself supported by parliament, had rather risen than sunk in his demands: yet he still continued to amuse the French ministry, in expressing a desire to see the dispute ter∣minated by negotiation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to shew that he had the treaty of marriage at heart, prolonged the time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d fixed for the discussion of that affair, and even empowered his ambassadors at Paris to protract it occasionally, as they should judge expedient.</P>

<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>This transaction, however, neither interrupted his measures for in∣vading France, nor hindered him fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m treating with the duke of Burgundy, who was not so satisfied with the peace of Arras, but that he wished to secure the alliance of Henry. Philip Morgan, an intelligent agent, whom the king of England employed in his most important negotiations, was sent to Flanders, on pretence of renewing the truce with the Flemings; but he had secret instructions to propose a league of a different nature: and the duke sent an envoy to England, to manage his interest with Henry; though he hesi∣tated with respect to the proffered alliance, as a step which he did not chuse to take, unless he should be compelled by necessity to throw himself into the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> arms of the English monarch. In the beginning of the year, Henry con∣sented<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1415.</NOTE> to a prolongation of the truce with France till the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst day of May; and, in the interim, the French ministry, being more and more startled at the expedition with which Henry prepared his armament, sent over twelve ambassa∣dors, at the head of whom was the archbishop of Bourges, who, in all pro∣bability, was empowered to make some new offer, which was rejected as the former; and all he could obtain was another short prolongation of the truce. While these ambassadors resided at London<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Henry a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>embled a great council of the lords temporal and spiritual, and declared t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, by the mouth of his uncle the bishop of Winchester, that he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>solved to invade France in person, in order to recover the inh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itance of his ancestors. This notification of a design which all the kingdom already knew, was intended for extracting from the French ambassadors the last terms they had to propose, which the king imagined they were ordered to suppress, until matters should be brought almost to extremity. He did not doubt but that France would consent to a peace, according to the stipulations of the treaty of Bretigny, rather than ha∣zard a war during the distractions of the kingdom; and on these terms, he, in all probability, would have agreed to a solid pacification. The archbishop perceived his drift; and, having no longer the least room to doubt of his hos∣tile intention, desired he might be indulged with time to return to France for fresh instructions: Henry granted his request; and the truce was again pro∣longed till the fifteenth day of July. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>By this time he had levied his army, and equipped a large fleet for transporting it to the continent. A large train of artillery was provided; Southampton was appointed the place of rendezvous. He had made a pro∣gress through the southern parts of the kingdom, and arrayed the counties and the clergy. At Reading he published a proclamation, directed to all his subjects, importing that the money granted by parliament was not sufficient to discharge the second payment of his troops; and desiring they would lend
<PB N="258" REF="2600"/>
him a sum of money upon such security as he should propose. Such was the eagerness o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the nation, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound himself amply supplied and accommo∣da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the money and necessaries that he wanted. The young earl of Northumberland being restored to his honours and estate, maintained forty m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n at arms, with one hundred and twenty archers: the same force was levied by the earl of Westmoreland. The ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>olk defrayed the ex∣pence o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alf a ship, twenty men at arms, and forty archers; and his example w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s followed by the lords Lovel, Berkeley, Darcy, Seymour, Roos, and Willoughby. Six men at arms and twenty archers were subsisted by the lord Morley: the lords S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ales and Randolfe served without pay; and all the other nobility contributed in some measure to the success of this expedition. Provision was made for the defence of the Scottish and Welsh Marches, as well as for those of Calais; and the king's brother the duke of Bedford con∣stituted lieutenant of the kingdom in Henry's absence, to be directed by a council, at the head of which was the archbishop of Canterbury. The truce was almost expired, when the archbishop of Bourges returned; and Henry granted him a public audience at Winchester, sitting in his robes of state, and surrounded by the princes of the blood, the prelates, and the nobility. The ambassador produced very respectful letters from the king of France, offering the princess Catherine, with a portion of eight hundred thousand crowns, a larger sum than ever had been given on such an occasion before: but, this offer being coldly received, the ambassador agreed to an addition of fifty thousand crowns, and the principality of Limoges. Henry, in consider∣ation of these concessions, replied, that if the French court would fix a day for the departure of the princess, and the payment of the money, and deliver up the proffered places and provinces, he would prolong the truce for fifty days; during which a congress might be held for settling the articles of the peace: and, in the mean time, he would give security for restoring the places to the crown of France, provided the treaty should not take effect. The am∣bassador declaring that his power did not extend so far, the bishop of Win∣chester, by the king's command, observed, at his next audience, that the French court had been insincere in all the negotiations; that their offers were not adequate to what the king of England had a right to demand; that they had infringed the treaty of Bretigny, contrary to all justice and good faith; and that Henry now appealed to the sword and decision of heaven. A decla∣ration to the same purpose, in writing under the great seal, was delivered to the archbishop, who, being a prelate of an hot fiery disposition, was so pro∣voked at the inflexibility of the English monarch, that he lost all patience. Forgetting his own character, he raved, blustered, and threatened in a very indecent manner; and even reproached Henry as a tyrant and usurper. This unseemly transport was overlooked with the most contemptuous indifference: he was dismissed in peace; and Henry proceeded in his preparations with re∣doubled<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b.</NOTE> vigour.</P>

<P>When the truce expired, hostilities were commenced in Picardy, between the French forces and the garrison of Calais, commanded by the ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of Warwick. The army and navy had been assembled at Southampton; and the king himself repaired to that place in order to embark, when he received <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>timation of a conspiracy formed against his person by Richard earl of Cam∣bridge,
<PB N="259" REF="2610"/>
brother to the duke of York, Henry lord Scrope of Masham, treasurer of England, and Sir Thomas Grey of Heton in Northumberland. The earl of Cambridge had married Anne Mortimer daughter to Roger earl of Marche, by Philippa daughter and heir of Lionel duke of Clarence, third son of Edward III. so that in right of this lady he was in blood nearer the crown than Henry. It was his ambition in all probability that projected this conspiracy, in hope that should the scheme prosper, he or his children might one day succeed to the throne, at the death of Mortimer earl of Marche, who had no issue. The design seems to have been half formed, or rather a vague and distant prospect than a full concerted plan. There appears to have been an absurd inconsistency in their intention; for they purposed to raise an army in Scotland, under the stale pretence of Richard's being alive; and at the same time to crown Mortimer in Wales, as the legal heir of that monarch. They knew Mortimer was a young nobleman of weak intellects, who had often told Cambridge that his confessor daily importuned him to claim the crown as his inheritance; and they did not suppose they should find any difficulty in prevailing upon him to countenance their design. In these sentiments they exacted from him an oath of secresy, and then communicated the plan they had projected in his favour. His fear immediately overcame his ambition: he desired they would give him time to consider their proposal, and imparted their whole conversation to Henry. The conspirators were immediately arrested and imprisoned in the castle of South∣ampton; to the constable of which they confessed their guilt, and submitted to his majesty's mercy. Sir Henry Gray was tried and convicted on this evidence by a common jury. A commission was issued for judging the two noblemen by their peers. They pleaded guilty; and the earl of Cambridge wrote a peni∣tent and pathetic letter to the king, imploring his forgiveness and clemency. But mercy was not Henry's predominant virtue: the earl and knight were be∣headed; and lord Scrope was hanged, drawn, and quartered as a traitor, ac∣cording to the literal tenour of his sentence, because his guilt was aggravated with ingratitude to the king, who had honoured him with particular marks of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>This affair delayed the king's departure till the fifteenth day of August, when he sailed from the port of Southampton with six thousand lances, four and twenty thousand archers, and about twenty thousand common infan∣try, on board of a fleet consisting of fifteen hundred vessels. After an ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y passage he landed at the mouth of the Seine in Normandy, about three leagues from Harfleur, the siege of which he undertook without any interruption from the constable d'Albret, who lay encamped at Rouen with a strong army, in order to watch the motions of the English. Harfleur was strongly fortified, and provided with a numerous garrison, which made a very gallant defence, under the command of the lord Estouteville, assisted by some of the best officers in France. But Henry carried on his attacks with such impetuosity, and plied his artillery with such success, that a considerable breach was made; and the besieged, finding it impracticable to maintain the place, capitulated on condi∣tion of surrendering, if not relieved by the Sunday after Michaelmas. A body of French troops, under the marechal l'Isle d'Adam, attempted to succour the town, but were defeated and repulsed; so that the term prescribed in the capi∣tulation
<PB N="260" REF="2620"/>
being expired, the garrison surrendered themselves prisoners of war; and Henry took possession of Har<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eur, which he peopled with an English colony. While his army was employed in repairing the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the place, he sent a cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lenge to the dauphin, proposing to decide <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ispute be∣tween the two crowns in single combat; but no regard was payed to his de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance. The r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duction of Harf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eur was a conquest of grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> importance, though it scarce attoned for the mortality which prevailed in the English army, which was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o wea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ened and diminished by the dysentery, that before Henry quitted Har∣fleur, not above one fourth part of those who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had brought from England r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mained fit for service: nor was it confined to the comm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> soldiers, who, from their manner of living, are mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> subject to this di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emper<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it had already proved fatal to the bishop of Norwich and the earl of Suffolk<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the duke of Clarence, with the earl of Arundel, and many other officers of distinction,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> were obliged to return to England, in hope of recovering in their native cli∣ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.

<P>So situated, and finding it would be impracticable to winter at Har∣fleur for want of provision and forage, he, with the advice of his council, re∣solved to begin his march by land for Calais, and pass the Somme at the place, where it was forded by his great grandfather Edward III. This enterprize was rendered extremely difficult, by a long su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ssion of rainy weather which had spoiled the roads; but what seemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it quite impracticable, was the precaution of the enemy. Suspecting th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e entertained some such design, they had broken down all the bridges, destroyed the causeways, and wasted the country, so that he could expect to find no supply in his route, either of forage or provision; and the constable d'Albret was at hand with a choice body of troops to attend his motions, and harrass him in his march by cutting off his detached parties. Henry was not ignorant of these circumstances, and knew that the whole kingdom of France was in arms to oppose his progress. He might have stayed at Har<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eur, and been supplied by sea with provision and other necessaries: he might have assembled a fleet that would have transported his army to England, without the least risque from the enemy: but he was in∣flamed with ambition to rival the exploits of his ancestors, who had triumphed at Crecy and Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iers, and undertook an expedition which even success could<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> not justify, and which seems to have been the result of rashness, obstinacy, and presumption. Having constituted his uncle the earl of D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rset governor of Harfleur, and Sir John Fastolfe, his lieutenant, at the head of a garrison <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mounting to three thousand men, he began his march towards the Somme with an army of twenty thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diers, the greater part of which was weakened by sick∣ness. When he reached the ford of Blanquetaque, he found the passage ren∣dered impracticable, by sharp stakes driven into the bed of the river, and a strong body of forces posted on the other side. He was not a little chagrined at this disappointment, which would have i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duced any other general to
<PB N="261" REF="2630"/>
retreat to Harfleur: but Henry was one of those heroes who are animated by difficulties; he resolved to march farther up the river, until he should find an opportunity of crossing; and this scheme he executed in spite of a thousand dangers and difficulties. He saw all the bridges broken down, all the passes defended, and was so harrassed by the enemy, that he could not send off a de∣tachment from the line of march, without running the risque of its being cut in pieces. His troops were afflicted with a dearth of provision and total want of necessaries, which, added to their distemper and the fatigues they underwent, would have driven them to despair, had not they been animated by the pre∣sence and example of their beloved monarch, who shared in all their hardships, and encouraged them by his alacrity. Perhaps even these cordials would have failed at last, if his affairs had not taken a favourable turn from an incident which at first had a very unfavourable aspect. The constable of France being reinforced by forty thousand men at arms, and joined by all the princes and noblemen of the kingdom, except the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, a council of war was held, and they unanimously resolved to allow Henry to cross the Somme, and give him battle between that river and Calais. In pursuance of this resolution, they withdrew their detachments from the passes, and marched into the county of St. Pol, with a view to attack the king of England after he should have crossed the river, so that his retreat should be intirety cut off.</P>

<P>Henry, finding the passes clear, forded the river between St. Quintin and Peronne, and advancing to Blagney, perceived the whole French army on the march towards Rousseauville and Agincourt, which lay in his route to Calais. He now saw his difficulties increase, and began to repent of the rash∣ness of his conduct. He found himself in the midst of an enemy's country, during the severest season of the year, at the head of an handful of men, ex∣hausted by distemper and fatigue, destitute of provision and proper accommo∣dation, while a prodigious army, amounting to one hundred thousand fighting men, blocked up the passage to the only place where he could expect to find shelter and assistance. In this emergency he sent a message to the French con∣stable, offering to restore Harfleur, and repair all the damage he had done to the French, nay even to give security that he would never again attempt to in∣vade France, if they would allow him to pass unmolested to Calais. Such was the offer made by the Black Prince, when he found himself surrounded at Poitiers; and the answer which Edward received was the same which they now returned to Henry; they rejected his offer, and proposed that he and his army should submit at discretion. When he treated this proposal with disdain, they sent three heralds to defy him to battle, leaving the time and place to his choice: he replied, that weakened and fatigued as he was, he would not seek an engagement; but as he intended to continue his route to Calais, they might attack him when and where they should think proper to chuse the scene of action. Then they took post between Rousseauville and Agincourt, and gave him notice they would engage him on the twenty-fifth day of October. As he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>During this interval of three days, he took all the precautions which the experience of the most able commander could have dictated. He
<PB N="262" REF="2640"/>
procured for his soldiers such refreshments as the nature of their situation would afford: he ordered their weapons and armour to be refitted and repaired: he invented a kind of sharp stakes for the defence of the archers: he continued night and day upon horseback, riding through the lines to animate the soldiers, and superintend the oeconomy of the camp: he encouraged the army with hope of success, by reminding them of the great victories obtained in France by their forefathers; assuring them that the enemy, though numerous, were raw, undisciplined, and imprudent; and he gave them plainly to under∣stand, they had no resource from death or captivity, but in the extraordinary efforts of their own valour. His affability, activity, and confidence, inspired the soldiers with such resolution and ardour, that far from dreading the num∣ber of the foe, they wished eagerly for the battle; and bore their distresses with heroic patience, in hope of being relieved by a speedy victory. Indeed they seemed to have lost all sense of distinction in numbers; for, on the day that preceded the battle, David Gam, a Welsh captain whom the king had sent to observe the posture of the enemy, being in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errogated by his majesty concerning the number of the French army, replied, with great composure, that there was number enough to be killed, enough to be taken prisoners, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit Liv. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> enough to run away. While Henry thus acted the part of an able and dili∣gent commander, the French officers spent their time in riot and rejoicing. When they considered the handful of English, who did not exceed fourteen thousand enseebled wretches, half dead with famine and disease, they looked upon the victory as having already declared in their favour. They are even said to have played at dice for the English prisoners before they were taken, and to have sent orders to the neighbouring villages to prepare lodging for those strangers: on the morning of the engagement, their insolence and presumption rose to such a pitch, that they detached another herald to Henry, to know what he proposed to give for his ransome. This insult he received with the most contemptuous moderation, desiring the messenger to tell those that sent him, a little time would decide to whom the ransom would belong.</P>

<P>On the day appointed for the decision of this great contest, both armies were drawn up at break of day in order of battle; and the constable D'Albret, who commanded the French, committed an error which was alto∣gether inexcusable, in chusing a narrow piece of ground, flanked by a rivulet and a thick wood, where he could not extend his front so as to enclose the English; where his cavalry could not act, and his superiority of number, in∣stead of being an advantage, was an encumbrance and misfortune. He di∣vided his army into three bodies, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e himself commanded the van, accom∣panied by the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts of Eu, Vendome, and Richemont, the famous marechal de Boucicaut, the great master of the cross∣bows, the lord Dampierre admiral of France, the dauphin D'Auvergne, and se∣veral other officers of distinction. The second line was commanded by the duke of Alençon, assisted by the duke of Bar, the counts of Vaudemont, Nevers, Sa∣lines, Roussi, and Grand Pré. At the head of the third body were the counts of Marle, Dampmartin, Faquenberg, and the sieur de Lauroy. While the French were employed in arranging these lines, which stood so thick that the soldiers had not room to use their weapons, Henry concealed four hundred lances in a wood upon the right, and about two hundred and fifty choice
<PB N="263" REF="2650"/>
archers on the left, in a low meadow covered with bushes. In order to extend his front equal to that of the enemy, he was obliged to form his little army into one line: the right wing commanded by the duke of York, with the lords Beaumont, Willoughby, and Stanhope, was advanced a little way before the center, which the king took under his own conduct, attended by his brother the duke of Gloucester, the earl Mareschal, and the young earl of Suffolk, whose father had died at Harfleur. The left, which may be denominated the rear, as it had not advanced so far as the other two divisions, was left under the di∣rection of the duke of Exeter; and nothing could be more prudent than this disposition, which was made by the advice of Sir Thomas Erpyngham, a re∣nowned soldier, who acted as Henry's marshal, and was the person who after∣wards gave the signal for the attack. The king himself appeared in the front of the line, mounted on a stately white courser, in splendid armour, with a golden crown fixed by way of crest to his helmet: four royal banners were displayed before him: he was followed by a great number of led horses in rich caparisons, and surrounded by the chief officers of his court and army. Whether the French generals were startled at the admirable disposition, and the firm countenance of the English, or had received orders to avoid a battle, certain it is, they stood in array, at the distance of two hundred and fifty paces, without proceeding to the attack; and the king of England began to imagine their intention was to starve him into a surrender. This was the wisest course they could have taken; and must have been attended with success, had Henry continued inactive; for his provisions were already quite exhausted, and the weather was so rainy that it would have been impracticable to keep the field much longer. Perceiving their drift, and conscious of his own situa∣tion, he ordered the archers to strike their stakes, which they planted by way of palisadoes in the front and flank; so that they could advance before and re∣tire behind them occasionally. He rode along the line, exhorting and en∣couraging the soldiers to behave like Englishmen. Then, alighting from his horse, he took his station in the main body, and commanded Sir Thomas Erpyngham to throw up his truncheon as the signal for the attack. The whole line raising a loud shout, advanced against the enemy; but Henry fear∣ing they would be out of breath before they could come to close fight, ordered them to halt about mid-way, and there the archers planted their piquets, to secure them from the French cavalry. The battle was begun by a flight of arrows, which did great execution, because the enemy stood so thick that every shaft took place, and even penetrated the armour of the French men at arms. The English bowmen had advanced beyond their stakes to make this general dis∣charge; but seeing the enemy's cavalry in motion to attack them, they re∣tired within their palisadoes with admirable order and dexterity, and plied the assailants so warmly, that they began to fall into confusion. The troops that lay in ambush on the right and left, charging them suddenly in flank, completed the disorder; at the same time the archers slinging their bows, rushed out upon them with their battle-axes and daggers, and a terrible slaughter ensued. Though this front line of the French consisted of the best troops, animated by the presence and example of so many noblemen, and was commanded by the constable in person, it could not sustain the impetuo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty of the attack, and being once disordered, all opposition was at an end: far from
<PB N="264" REF="2660"/>
being able to rally, they had not room to turn, and were so encumbered by one another, that they themselves contributed to the victory of the English, who slaughtered them in heaps, until their arms were tired with the work of carnage. Though the constable, with a great number of principal officers, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain, and the first line of the French entirely routed, the battle continued st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> undecided; and the second line, commanded by the duke of Alencon, stood firm and eager to engage. The English, who were fatigued with action, retiring behind the main body, to take breath and form themselves anew, Henry in person led up his division to the charge, and being animated by the success of his first effort, added to his natural courage and vivacity, performed exploits of valour which equally astonished his own soldiers and those of the enemy.</P>

<P>While he thus exerted himself, in a manner that did much more honour to his personal prowess than to his conduct, eighteen French knights, who had engaged in an association to take him dead or alive, made their way sword in hand to the place where he fought, and one of them stunned him with the blow of his battle-ax, which, however, did not penetrate his helmet. In all probability he must have fallen a sacrifice to the determined resolution of those associates, had not David Gam the Welsh captain, and two other of∣ficers of the same nation, rushed between him and the assailants, and lost their lives in his defence. When he recollected his spirits, he found those three gal∣lant soldiers dying of the wounds they had received, and knighted them as they lay upon the field of battle. The eighteen French knights were killed to a man; and Henry, still more stimulated by the danger he had escaped, rushed into the midst of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with redoubled impetuosity, until he and his brother Gloucester, who fought by his side, found themselves quite sepa∣rated from the troops they commanded. In this hazardous situation, Glou∣cester was felled to the ground by the stroke of a mace; and Henry covering him with his shield, sustained the shock of a whole host of assailants, until the duke of York came to his relief. At that very instant he received a blow upon the head, that made him stagger and fall upon his knees; but he sprang up in a moment, and laid the aggressor at his fect. His troops, inspired by his example to a degree of enthusiasm, rushed forward as one man with irre∣sistable fury, which bore down all before them, and disordered the enemy in such a manner, that all the endeavours of their officers could not reduce them to form, or persuade them to oppose the career of the English. The duke of Alen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on seeing his division in danger of being totally defeated, resolved to make one attack that should either restore the battle or save him the mortifica∣tion of surviving the disgrace of his country. He put himself at the head of some chosen volunteers, and cutting his way to the spot where Henry fought, exclaimed that he was the duke of Alencon; then rushing upon the English monarch, cleft his crown with the first stroke of his sword: he had not an opportunity of repeating his blow; for Henry returned the salutation in such a manner as brought him to the ground; and with his own hand slew two of his followers. He endeavoured to save the life of Alençon; but the guards were so exasperated at his attempt, that they dispatched him immediately, be∣fore the king could interpose effectually in his behalf. After the death of this nobleman, the French made no opposition; but either endeavoured to save themselves by flight, or voluntarily offered their throats to the slaughter.</P>

<P>The third line was still intire, and much more numerous than the whole English army. They were fresh and vigorous, while the victors fainted with the fatigue of the action, added to the weakness occasioned by their dis∣temper, which was so violent that they are said to have fought without breeches, to save the trouble of untrussing: but the third division of the French were so intimidated by the disaster of the other two lines, and the dreadful scene of carnage acting before their eyes, that they refused to obey the command of their generals, and, instead of advancing to the charge, retired from the field of battle: though they still continued in a body, until Henry sent an herald to declare that should they remain in that posture until he could come up with them, they should be all massacred without mercy. Intimidated by this mes∣sage, they dispersed, and left him intirely master of the field. He had not time to congratulate himself upon the victory, when he was informed that the enemy were in his rear, and already in possession of his camp. Concluding they intended to renew the battle, he forthwith commanded all the prisoners to be put to the sword, except those of the most distinguished quality; and this inhuman order was punctually executed. He then marched towards the camp, and found it already plundered by a body of fugitives under the com∣mand of Robert de Bournonville, who retired at his approach. Nothing now remaining to oppose his arms, he returned thanks to heaven in public for this extraordinary success; and proclaimed that it should be ascribed to no other but God alone. Then he commanded a French herald to declare to whom he thought the victory belonged; and he adjudging it to the English, the king asked the name of a castle to which he pointed with his finger. Being informed that it was known by the name of Agincourt, "Henceforward then," said he, "this action shall be named the battle of Agincourt." In this memorable battle, which began about ten in the morning and lasted till three in the after∣noon, the French lost the constable d'Albret, the duke of Alençon, who was a prince of the blood, the duke of Brabant and count de Nevers, brothers to the duke of Burgundy, the duke de Bar, the counts of Vaudemont, Marle, Roussi, Faquenberg, several officers of great distinction, and about ten thou∣sand soldiers left dead upon the field. Among the prisoners, who were very numerous before the massacre, the English found the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts of Eu, Vendome, Richemont, Estouteville, the mare∣chal de Boucicaut, and sixteen hundred persons of distinction: but the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monstrelet.

<P>Henry, after having given orders touching the dead and wounded, marched back to Marcoucelly, where he had encamped the preceding night, that his troops might be more conveniently refreshed, and next day proceeded on his route to Calais: when he passed by the field of battle, he took that op∣portunity to commend his army for their gallant behaviour; but at the same time exhorted them to bear their good fortune with moderation, and attribute their success to the God of battles, who had wrought a miracle in their favour. He treated the French prisoners with all the politeness of his great uncle the Black Prince, declaring that the victory was not owing to his superior valour, but to the immediate interposition of providence, which had made use of them as an instrument to punish the sins of the French nation; and he assured them,
<PB N="266" REF="2720"/>
that he was now more disposed to peace than he had been immediately be∣fore<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> the battle. Some days after his arrival at Calais, he received a message from the duke of Burgundy, who challenged him to single combat, that he might have an opportunity to revenge the death of his two brothers, who had been barbarously massacred by Henry's order on the field of Agincourt. The king, desirous of preventing a rupture with a prince from whose alliance he ex∣pected great advantages, restored the duke's gauntlet to the herald, and dis∣missed him with a civil answer, importing that he had no hand in the death of his brothers, which was entirely owing to his own subject Robert de Bour∣nonville, whom he desired him to punish for his treachery. The duke would have followed his advice, had not that plunderer been protected by his son the count de Charol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, to whom Bournonville presented a curious sword adorned with diamonds, which he found among the baggage belonging to the king of England. About the middle of November, Henry embarked for England with his prisoners, and after a dangerous passage landed at Dover. From thence he proceeded to London, where he was received in triumph amidst the acclamations of his people. The first step he took was to appoint a day of religious thanksgiving for the success of the campaign: then he bestowed the most honourable obsequies on the duke of York and the earl of Suffolk; and the former of these noblemen was succeeded in his title and estate by Richard, son of the earl of Cambridge, who had been beheaded at Southampton.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The battle of Agincourt produced no other advantage to Henry, but that of increasing the domestic troubles of France; for he had not gained a single foot of land by his victory; and all the spoil and the ransom was not sufficient to defray the expence of the campaign: but he found his account in the divisions which that event renewed among the French princes. The duke of Burgundy seized this opportunity to re-establish himself in the administration, from which he had been excluded by the treaty of Arras. He said, that at a time when the kingdom was threatened with destruction, he, as a prince of the blood, and first peer of France, had a title to assist the king with his ad∣vice; and he resolved to support his right with force of arms. For this pur∣pose he approached Paris at the head of an army: but the dauphin, though his own son-in-law, opposed his pretensions with all his influence. That prince bestowed the office of constable on the count of Armagnac, the duke's inveterate enemy, who prosecuted all the Burgundians with the utmost ran∣cour; and this inflamed the two factions to such a degree, that they never could unite against the common enemy of the kingdom. The dauphin, who was at the head of the administration, entered blindly into all the resentments of the constable, and utterly neglected all measures that could contribute to the re∣establishment of the affairs of the realm. In a few months he was taken off by poison, and then the constable remained sole master of the king's person and the government, till the return of John duke of Touraine, upon whom the title of dauphin devolved, and who at that time resided with his father-in-law the count of Hainault. Resolving to observe a strict neutrality, he sent orders to both factions to lay down their arms. The duke of Burgundy, who had miscarried in his attempt upon Lagny, obeyed his command, on pretence of pure deference, and retired to his own dominions: but the constable was not so pliable. Being master of the king's person, he did not think the dauphin had a right to
<PB N="267" REF="2730"/>
command him, until he should be in possession of the regency, which the constable determined to keep out of his reach, unless he would declare against the Bur∣gundians. This opposition of the constable hindered the dauphin from returning to the kingdom. France could not possibly take proper measures for her own defence, while the duke of Burgundy negotiated privately with the king of England; while the duke of Hainault courted the favour of that monarch, that his son-in-law the dauphin might be fixed in the regency; and while Lewis of Anjou, king of Sicily, who headed the faction of Orleans, had pro∣jected a plan for depriving the dauphin of his birthright, that the crown might devolve upon Charles count of Ponthieu, who had married his daughter. All these princes thought they could not take a more effec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ual method to ac∣complish their several aims, than that of having recourse to the alliance of Henry; so that all the princes of France, from different views, sollicited the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> friendship of that king, against whom they ought to have united as the common enemy of their country.</P>

<P>Henry, notwithstanding the success of his arms, seemed to have<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1416.</NOTE> laid aside all thoughts of prosecuting the war, and turned his attention wholly to the business of negotiation. He was extremely desirous of concluding an alliance with the duke of Burgundy; and for this purpose, agents were con∣tinually passing a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d repassing, between Flanders and England, on pretence of settling a treaty of commerce between the subjects of the two powers, who had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or many ages maintained an intercourse of this nature. The duke sought to conceal the true motives of this negotiation, lest it should give umbrage to the Parisians who favoured his interest; and Henry did not chuse that it should be known, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the court of France, being alarmed at the prospect of such a conjunction, should find means to frustrate his design, by a coalition with the duke of Burgundy. In the beginning of the year, the emperor Sigismund had arrived at Paris, on purpose, as he affirmed, to mediate a peace between the two crowns of France and England; and he was permitted to exercise acts of sovereignty, by presiding in the parliament of Paris, and creating a knight, as if he had a right of paramount over all the kings in Europe. He had pro∣jected a truce for four years between the two crowns, which was rejected by the constable: and finding his endeavours ineffectual at Paris, he repaired to England, with a view, if he could not mediate a peace between Charles and Henry, to form an alliance between himself and the English monarch; and this indeed seems to have been the chief intent of his journey from his own dominions. He was brought over with his train from Calais in English bot∣toms; but when he approached the shore in a shaloupe, the duke of Glou∣cester, and some other noblemen, rushed into the sea with their swords drawn, and stopped the vessel, to the no small astonishment and terror of the emperor, who desiring to know the meaning of such an extraordinary reception, the duke told him, that if he came with pretensions to any right of sovereignty in England, they had orders from the king to prevent his landing; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his sole aim in coming was to act the part of a friend and peace-maker, he should be received with all the honours due to his imperial dignity. Sigismund assuring him that he was come in character of a mediator, they received him on shore with marks of the most profound respect; and he was magnificently entertained upon the road from Dover to London.

He had engaged with the Genoese for some large carr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks, with a number of cross-bows, to join the French navy: he found some pretext for conveying king Charles to Rouen, that he himself might be at hand to superintend the operations; and took his measures with such secrecy that Henry never dreamed of his intention. The earl of Dorset, who commanded in Harfleur, made incursions to the very gates of Rouen, from whence he carried off a great booty, even whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the count resided in that city; and the constable, with a body of choice troops, endeavoured to cut off his retreat. At first he obtained some advantages; but, the English perceiv∣ing his design was to prevent their return to Harfleur, sought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o desperately, that though he greatly outnumbered them, they were ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ged to retreat with great precipitation. The Genoese carracks being arrived, and all the previous measures taken, the constable ordered his troops to assemble privately from the different quarters in which they had been dispersed, and putting himself at the head of a large army, invested Harfleur by land, while the viscount de Narbonne blocked it up by sea in such a manner that no supplies could enter the place.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Henry was confounded at this attempt; for he imagined France was not in a condition to undertake such an enterprize. He now plainly perceived himself a dupe to the constable's negotiation; and he endeavour∣ed to amuse him in his turn. He expressed the most sincere inclination to peace, and proposed an interview with his cousin, so he now termed Charles, whom he had before distinguished by the name of his Adversary of France. He hoped an interview would produce a truce, during which he might succour Harfleur, which was but indifferently provided. His proposal of an interview being rejected, he sent Morgan, as his envoy, to demand a truce, which the constable did not think fit to grant at such a juncture. These attempts, however, did not hinder him from equipping an armament for the relief of Harfleur, which was so vigorously defended by the earl of Dorset, that although the siege began in the middle of June, the constable had made very little progress at the end of July. Henry having assembled his forces and fleet, resolved to embark in person; and it was with great difficulty that
<PB N="269" REF="2750"/>
the emperor at length dissuaded him from engaging personally in an expedition, the success of which depended as much upon the weather as upon the courage and conduct of the commander. He suffered himself to be persuaded; and de∣legated the chief command to his brother the duke of Bedford, who set sail about the fifteenth day of August, with a fleet of four hundred ships, having on board twenty thousand land forces under the conduct of the earls Mareschal, Oxford, Huntingdon, Warwick, Arundel, Salisbury, and Devonshire. The duke directed his course to the mouth of the Seine, where the French and Genoese f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet lay ready to receive him; and here an obstinate engagement ensued. The enemy's g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llies being provided with oars, were more easily wrought and floated in shallower water than the English vessels; and the Genoese cross-bow men were counted the best marines in the world. Notwithstanding these ad∣vantages, when they came to close quarters, the English boarded them with great intrepidity, and fought with such fury that the enemy were entirely defeated. Two thousand of their best men were slain, seven of their largest ships sunk in the engagement, four taken, and several driven by the victors on the coast, where they perished. The duke of Bedford having thus cleared the mouth of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paul. Aemil.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>During these transactions, the duke of Burgundy continued to carry on his private negotiations with Henry under various pretexts; some∣times pretending to renew the truce between England and Flanders; and some∣times to consult about the affairs of the church, depending in the council of Constance. The duke of Burgundy still hesitated between his duty and what he apprehended to be his interest. As a prince of the blood-royal of France and first peer of the realm, he could not conclude an alliance with England, without acting in diametrical opposition to his honour and his duty, and even disobliging his own partisans: he therefore spun out the negotiation, without any design of concluding the alliance, except in case of necessity, until the beha∣viour of the constable provoked him to throw himself into the arms of England. As the dauphin still resided with his father-in-law at the court of Hainault, the duke of Burgundy resolved, in the mean time, to strengthen his interest by a league with that young prince, who was excluded from his father's court by the power and intrigues of the constable. They had an interview at Valen∣ciennes, where it was agreed, that the dauphin should try once more by fair means to obtain admittance to his father's court and councils, that he might acquire that rank and influence in the administration, to which he was intitled by his birth and expectations; that should the attempt succeed, the duke of Burgundy should be invited to court; but in case of its failure, they should take other measures for dispossessing the constable, and setting the king at li∣berty from the restraint in which he lived. In pursuance of this resolution, the dauphin and his father-in-law repaired to Compeigne, from whence the count of Hainault went by himself to Paris, with a view to negotiate the demands of the dauphin, and the return of the duke of Burgundy. But he had no sooner mentioned the name of this nobleman, than he was interrupted by the consta∣ble, who declared that the dauphin should never be received at court, until he should have renounced all connexion with the duke of Burgundy. The count of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainault, provoked at his presumption, could not help dropping some me∣nacing

He was suc∣ceeded in the title of dauphin by his younger brother Charles count of Pon∣thieu, son-in-law to the king of Sicily, who was suspected of having effected<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> the death of John, whom he himself did not long survive.</P>

<P>Charles, who was now presumptive heir of the crown, declared in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour of the Armagnac faction; and the constable was more than ever con∣firmed in the post of minister. His hatred to the duke of Burgundy induced him to seize every opportunity to persecute that prince's adherents, who were very numerous at Paris, until they could no longer endure his tyranny and ru∣pacious disposition; and then they projected a scheme for introducing their chief into the city. The conspiracy was discovered; and the count d'Armagnac wreaked his vengeance upon the whole party of the Burgundians, in such a bar∣barous manner, as incensed the duke to an eager desire of making reprisals upon the count's adherents. All his scruples now yielded to his resentment. He publicly concluded a truce with Henry for all his dominions, comprehending even those he possessed in France; and by his embassadors at the court of Eng∣land, agreed to an interview with that prince at Calais, where he promised to do him homage as lawful king of France and his liege sovereign. Mean while the emperor having tried in vain to effect an accommodation between the two crowns, concluded a perpetual alliance with Henry, whom he promised to assist in recovering the kingdom of France; and the English monarch engaged to sup∣port him in obliging Charles and some other princes to do him homage for cer∣tain<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> countries which, as he alledged, were fiefs of the empire. This treaty was signed at Canterbury in his way to Dover, where he embarked for Calais, pur∣posing to stay at that place for Henry, who had agreed to meet the duke of Burgundy in the beginning of October. The court of France, alarmed at the report of this interview, sent thither the archbishop of Rheims and some other embassadors, on pretence of treating about an accommodation: though the real design of their journey was to discover what should pass at the interview. Henry perceived their drift, and had no objection to their being witnesses of the duke's arrival at Calais; he therefore immediately complied with the request of the French court, when they demanded safe-conducts, and appointed com∣missioners to treat with them upon the subject of their proposals: but he took such pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>autions, that they could not, with all their art, dive into the true na∣ture of his transaction with the duke of Burgundy, whose pretence for meeting Henry was to confirm and ratify the truce already published at London.</P>

<P>The king of England crossing the sea about the latter end of September, granted a safe-conduct to the duke of Burgundy and his retinue, amounting to eight hundred horsemen; and sent his brother the duke of Glou∣cester to St. Omers, there to remain as an hostage for the safety of the duke's person. Thus secured, he arrived at Calais, where he was received with great magnificence; and subscribed and swore to the following articles, which had been preconcerted between their respective agents and embassadors: The king having explained to the duke of Burgundy his right and title to the crown of France, and his intention to obtain by force of arms, the satisfaction which his
<PB N="271" REF="2770"/>
adversary has hitherto refused, the duke promises to give his letters patent to the following effect: That although, for want of information, he had hitherto adhered to the contrary party, which he thought was in the right, yet now being better informed, he promises henceforth to be firmly attached to the king of England, his heirs and successors, as true and lawful kings of France, in the same manner as if they were actually in possession of the crown: Although for the present the king does not exact homage from the duke, nevertheless the said duke acknowledges it to be due; and promises that as soon as Henry shall be in possession of any considerable part of France, he will do him liege homage, and take the oath of allegiance, as any other vassal of the crown of France ought to do to his sovereign: The duke of Burgundy likewise pro∣mises to pursue all the means and use all the methods which have been secretly stipulated, for putting the king of England in actual possession of the kingdom of France: While the king is employed in the prosecution of his just rights, the duke of Burgundy shall make war with all his might upon Henry's enemies in the kingdom of France; namely A. B. C. D. and all their territories and possessions, who shall prove disobedient to the king of England: In all the al∣liances or letters patent concluded and ratified between the king and the duke, in which the said duke may have excepted the king's adversary or his son, he does not understand that such exception shall prejudice his engagements to the king, which shall be punctually fulfilled: If the duke, from political views, may have made some exceptions in favour of the said adversary and his son, he wills and understands, that all such exceptions shall be null and void, and of no value. These articles were reduced to the form of letters patent, written and signed by the duke's own hand, sealed with his privy seal; and both he and his son the count of Charolois, solemnly swore that they should be punctually performed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Henry having gained a considerable point by this alliance, which reflects eternal disgrace upon the duke of Burgundy and his son, as traitors to their country, concluded a truce with France till the second day of February, and returned to England, fully determined to recommence the war with re∣doubled vigour. The parliament meeting on the nineteenth day of October, the chancellor gave them to understand, that all the king's intentions had been frustrated by the pride and presumption of the enemy; and that, seeing the dispute must be appealed to the sword, he had concluded treaties of alliance with the emperor and other German princes, of which, however, he could not avail himself without the support of his parliament, whose advice and assistance he craved accordingly. The members were so well pleased with his character and declaration, that they granted two whole tenths and two fifteenths; while the clergy voted two tenths to be raised from their own body. In the mean time, as this supply could not produce ready money for present service, they voted indemnification to all persons who should accommodate the king for his pressing occasions before the subsidies could be levied. Then the king pub∣lished a general pardon for all crimes, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>except such as were capital; and created the earl of Dorset duke of Exeter, in consideration of his gallant defence of Harfleur. Notwithstanding the parliament's liberality, and the convenience of the loan for which they had given security, the supplies proved insufficient to answer the mighty views of Henry, who had resolved to take a body of foreign
<PB N="272" REF="2780"/>
troops into his service, and pay subsidies to some German princes, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip or neutrality he thought it his interest to secure. To answer these demands, he mortgaged all his own valuable effects: the crown he wore, upon the days of ceremony, was pledged with his uncle the bishop of Winchester; and he pawned his jewels to the mayor of London.</P>

<P>The court of France, startled at Henry's preparations, revolved every measure they could divert to retard his expedition. The constable knew that any propositions coming from him would be deemed insincere at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urt of England; and, therefore, he concerted a scheme with the French n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emen who were prisoners at London. In consequence of his instructions, the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, with the counts of Eu and Vendome, p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>end<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng to look upon the affairs of France as desperate, took occasion to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the English courtiers, that they were disposed to treat with the king for themselves in particular; and they imagined that Henry would break the ice, and make advances to them on this subject. But, he payed very little regard to their overtures, which he justly supposed were calculated to divert him from his purpose; and they being disappointed in this expectation, at length demanded an audience, in which they desired to know his pretensions, that they might deliberate with themselves, whether or not they could in honour<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> comply with his proposals. Henry told them plainly, that he had no other proposal to make, but that they should acknowledge him as king of France, and their lawful sovereign: a declaration so disagreeable, that the duke of Or∣leans told the king, there was no answer to be made to such a demand; and nothing farther passed at this conference. In a few weeks after this audience, the duke of Bourbon gave Henry to understand, that, by means of certain per∣sons sent to France to make inquiry about the nature of his majesty's preten∣sions, he and the other prisoners had received new lights; and that, for his own part, he was perfectly convinced of Henry's just title to the crown, which he claimed by right of inheritance: but, that as his majesty was willing to de∣sist from that claim, in consideration of certain provinces which he demanded, it was the sentiment of him, and all the prisoners, that the French court should comply with his demands; and that they were resolved to employ all their power and influence towards his satisfaction. He therefore asked permission to go to France, where he would, in the name of himself and fellow-prisoners, exhort the king to embrace such reasonable proposals; and should their advice be rejected, they would deem themselves absolved from their allegiance to Charles. The duke engaged for himself in particular, to put all his places in the hands of governors devoted to his interest; to return to England at any time the king should prescribe, and do him homage as his lawful sovereign. But, in the mean time, he begged his majesty would not divulge his proposals until he should return, that he might not be exposed to the resentment of the French court, during his residence in that country. Tho' Henry still doubted the duke's sincerity, he was so agreeably flattered with the prospect of possessing so many fair provinces, without risque or expence, that he complied with Bourbon's request: but he did not intermit a moment in his preparations. The duke stayed some time in France, but performed no part of his engage∣ments to Henry, who was so piqued at the attempt to impose on him, that when the duke returned to England, he and his fellow-prisoners were con∣fined

<P>The condition of France was now truly deplorable. The king incapable of managing the reins of government; the duke of Burgundy, first peer of the realm, and head of a powerful party, engaged in secret alliance with the enemy of his country; the other princes of the blood prisoners in Eng∣land; and the kingdom governed by a young prince of fourteen years of age, under the guidance of the count d'Armagnac, a nobleman of the most violent passions, who knew no gratification equal to that of revenge, and openly sa∣crificed the public good to his resentment and ambition. Henry was not a prince to neglect such a favourable opportunity of executing the great designs he had projected. He ordered his navy to be equipped, and his army to ren∣dezvous at Southampton, by the fourteenth of February. There they assem∣bled, to the number of about eight and twenty thousand men, the flower of the English soldiery, better armed and appointed than any other troops in the world, and commanded by officers of birth, experience, and distinction. Be∣fore the king embarked, he sent the earl of Huntingdon, with a squadron, to scour the channel, where he fell in with nine large Genoese ships, in the service of France, which he engaged and defeated, after having sunk three, and taken the like number, on board of which was the bastard of Bourbon, admiral of France, with half a year's pay for the whole French navy: these Huntingdon brought in triumph to the harbour of Southampton.</P>

<P>Henry having appointed the duke of Bedford regent of the kingdom, embarked at Portsmouth on the twenty-third day of July, and landed on the first of August at Beville in Normandy. The first place he invested was the strong castle of Touque, which surrendered on the ninth day of the month; and the reduction of this place was followed by that of Dam∣bierres, which submitted to the earl of Salisbury. By this time the duke of Burgundy had penetrated to the heart of France. The imperious disposition of the constable, the death of the two dauphins, which was imputed to his treachery, and the exile of the queen, whom he had persuaded the dauphin to banish from Paris to Tours, furnished the duke with a plausible pretext for making a diversion in favour of the English monarch. He published a mani∣festo against the constable, in which he exaggerated his vices and misconduct: then he wrote to the king, signifying, that, as first peer of the realm, he could not help endeavouring to prevent the total ruin of the nation; and, finding that some towns of consequence declared in his favour, he began his march, at the head of an army, for Paris, hoping that the dauphin and constable would either abandon that city, in order to oppose the English, or be obliged to lay aside all thoughts of opposition to the progress of Henry. This last part of the alternative was what they chose, as being much more willing to see part of the kingdom conquered by the public enemy, than the government wrested out of their hands by their private adversaries. For this reason, Henry met with no opposition in the field; tho' the city of Caen, which he besi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged, made a vigorous defence for some time, until the walls, being undermined, he ef∣fected a breach in two different parts, and took the place by storm. After having made himself master of the city, he convened the principal inhabitants in the town-hall, commanded them to deliver up their arms, and then ordered

But these conferences ceased in a very little time; for, in the beginning of the congress, the English envoys declared, that Henry would abate nothing of the following propositions: That the king of England should espouse the princess Catherine: That king Charles sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d enjoy the crown for life; but that, after his death, it should devolve upon t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e king of England; and, in the mean time, as Charles was incapable of go∣verning,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> Henry should act as regent of France.

C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> court of France underwent a new revolution: the council of Constance, after having deposed three pretended popes, had at length elected the cardinal Co∣lonna, who assumed the name of Martin V. and this pontiff, immediately after his elevation, sent two legates to France, to reconcile the two factions of that nation. These agents were so pressing in their sollicitations, that both parties sent deputies to Montereau-faute-yonne, where, after warm disputes and alter∣cation, it was agreed, that the dauphin, and the duke of Burgundy, should govern the kingdom conjunctly, during the prevalence of the king's disorder. But this convention was frustrated by the intrigues of the constable, who could not endure the thought of the duke's being at the head of the administration. The violent opposition which the count d'Armagnac made to this agreement, which was the measure that bade fairest for the advantage of the kingdom, ex∣cited a clamour against him through the whole nation, and particularly in Paris, which had always favoured the cause of Burgundy. The inhabitants, who adhered to that faction, held several consulations in private: they, at length, found means to introduce, by night, Lisle d'Adam, governor of Pontoise, one of the duke's most zealous partisans, who entered the city with eight hun∣dred horse; and the Parisians, immediately taking up arms, made a terrible massacre among those that wished well to the Armagnac interest. Tanneguy de Châtel, governor of the Bastile, finding it impracticable to quell this in∣surrection, ran directly to the Louvre, and, seizing the dauphin in his shirt, conveyed him to his fortress, from whence he, the next day, retired to Melun, because he did not think himself safe in the Bastile, from the rage of the popu∣lace, who secured the king's person, and committed the constable to prison. Those who had been exiled from Paris, on account of their attachment to the duke of Burgundy, no sooner heard of this transaction, than they returned from all quarters, and inflamed the people with redoubled rage against their adversaries. The massacre was renewed on the twelfth day of June, when the constable was brought from prison, and murthered in the street, through which his body was dragged with the utmost indignity; and his creature the chancellor, several bishops, and others, amounting to the number of two thou∣sand, fell sacrifices to the same unbridled barbarity. When these tumults sub∣sided, the queen and the duke of Burgundy repaired to that city, which they entered in triumph; and, having the king in their power, issued whatever edicts, or orders, they thought might be conducive to their own interest; while the dauphin, who likewise assumed the title of regent, threatened all those who should obey the duke of Burgundy: so that the partisans of each faction were treated as rebels by the other; and even a neutrality was ac∣counted criminal. To these distractions, if we add the progress of a conquer∣ing enemy in the bowels of the country, and a dreadful plague that ravaged the city of Paris, every reader must own, that the condition of France was truly wretched. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE></P>

Guy de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> who commanded in the place, turned out all the use<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss mouths, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a great quantity of provisions, cleared the ditches, and made all the preparations for a vigorous defence. Henry having summoned him to sur∣render, and received for answer, that he would hold out to the last extremity, ordered the town to be invested on all sides; and, in the dispositions he made for this purpose, took such precautions as might serve for a model to a mo∣dern engineer. The besieged made a great number of sallies, but were conti∣nually repulsed with loss; 'till, at length, they were so hampered, by his lines of circumva<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation, that they durst not venture to come forth, and all commu∣nication with the Seine being cut off, both above and below the town, they began to feel the miseries of want. Then they addressed themselves to the duke of Burgundy for succour. That prince followed the maxims of his predecessor and antagonist, the count of Armagnac, and was much more intent upon main∣taining himself against the practices of his private enemies, than upon opposing the progress of the king of England. He employed, however, the pope's legate to use their endeavours with Henry to relinquish the siege of Rouen; and the cardinal d'Ursini repaired to the English camp, and offered himself as a mediator; but Henry perceived his drift, and lent a deaf ear to all his pro∣positions.</P>

<P>Then the duke assembled a body of forces, and pretended he would give battle to the English. On this pretence, he conveyed the king as far as Beauvois; but attempted nothing further against the enemies of his country. By this time, in all probability, he had altered his sentiments with regard to the king of England, because his revenge was now satiated with the blood of the constable and his adherents; so that he had no further occasion for Henry's assistance; and his affection for his own country and family recurring, he could not be well pleased to see the most inveterate enemy of France in the heart of the kingdom which he himself governed. On the other hand, he was obliged to keep measures with Henry, who had it in his power to destroy all the duke's po∣pularity, by publishing the secret treaty of alliance, which would have ren∣dered him odious to all his countrymen. Thus situated, he had observed a kind of equivocal conduct since his re-establishment in the ministry, and seemed to be perfectly neutral in every thing that concerned Henry's success or ope∣rations. The besieged, despairing of his assistance, had recourse to the dauphin, who was not in a condition to raise the siege by force of arms; and, therefore, attempted it by the method of negotiation. Whether he was really inclined
<PB N="277" REF="2830"/>
to conclude a lasting peace with Henry, as he pretended, or only endeavoured to amuse him with a treaty; certain it is, he made overtures to the English monarch, and even expressed a desire of treating, not only concerning the peace with France, and the match between Henry and Catherine, but also about an alliance between the king of England and the dauphin, against the duke of Burgundy. Henry, whose interest it was to widen the breach between the dauphin and the duke, listened to the proposal, in a congress, with pleasure, and appointed the archbishop of Canterbury, the earls of Warwick and Salis∣bury, Philip Morgan, and several other able negociators, his ambassadors, to treat with the dauphin's plenipotentiaries. On this occasion, Henry acted the part of a crafty politician, rather than of a disinterested hero; for, on the very day that he signed the instructions of those ambassadors, he wrote a let∣ter to the duke of Burgundy, assuring him, that if the negotiation for peace should be renewed, he would do all that lay in his power to bring it to a happy issue. This declaration induced the minister to appoint the bishops of Arras and Beauvois, the first president de Morvillers, and some others, plenipo∣tentiaries to negotiate the accommodation. Thus the king of England, by treating with both parties at one time, imagined he should manage their mu∣tual jealousy, in such a manner, as would tend to his own advantage. The conference between the English ambassadors, and those of the dauphin, were opened on the twenty-sixth day of November, at Alençon, where the former declared, they would not treat of the match until the articles of the peace should be adjusted. Then they insisted upon knowing the utmost offers the French envoys had power to make; and, after numberless arts and evasions practised by the dauphin's agents, understood that he was willing to give up the towns and provinces ceded to England by the treaty of Bretigny, on con∣dition of Henry's doing homage for them to the crown of France. The En∣glish rejected the proposal concerning homage, and demanded Normandy, as an addition to the other provinces: they likewise desired to know, what secu∣rity the dauphin could give for the execution of the treaty; and the French ambassadors, having no power to treat on these subjects, the conferences proved abortive. This negotiation was hardly at an end, when the ambassa∣dors of the two crowns began another at Pont de l'Arche, under the mediation of the pope's legate: but this was interrupted almost as soon as begun, by a frivolous punctilio, which plainly proved, that the duke of Burgundy was not in earnest. The plenipotentiaries of Charles demanded, that the writings should be engrossed in the French language; and the English refused to comply with the proposal: in vain did the legates recommend a medium, and advise, that there should be two copies written, one in French, and the other in Latin; an expedient to which Henry consented: the duke of Burgundy was inflexible; and the end of the congress was frustrated. Nevertheless, it did not fail to alarm the dauphin, who, being ignorant of the particulars of the transaction, apprehended a peace between Henry and the duke of Burgundy, which could not but be to his prejudice: he therefore intreated Henry to ap∣point a place for renewing the negotiation begun at Alençon; and the king of England finding his account in blowing the coals of dissention, agreed to send ambassadors to Louviers, in the beginning of February. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

During this siege and blockade, above fifty thousand of the inhabitants had perished by the sword, by famine, and distemper; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rvivors seeing nothing before them but the like misery or slaughter, sent deputies to Henry to sollicit terms of capitulation; but he insisted upon their s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrendering at discretion. Those deputies could not help upbraiding him with his crue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty in reducing them by famine, when he had such a fair opportunity of distinguishing his valour in taking it by assault; and he was not a little pro∣voked by their reproach. When they reported his inflexibility and imperious behavio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to their fellow-citizens, they collected fresh courage from resentment and despair, and resolved to undermine a large part of the wall; so that, upon its falling, they might rush out in a body, and either force their way through the besiegers, or die at once upon the swords of the enemy. Henry being informed of their desperate design, thought proper to abate of his rigour, and offer terms which, though severe, they accepted. They agreed that the city and ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le of Rouen should be surrendered to the king of England, if not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before the nineteenth day of January: That all the inhabitants should submit to his mercy: That they should pay three hundred thousand crowns of go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, by way of ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om: And that all the soldiers of the garrison should swear upon t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e evange<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sts that they would not bear arms against the king of Eng∣land be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t day of January next ensuing.

<P>After the reduction of Rouen, Henry sent part of his army into Picardy, under the command of the duke of Exeter, who soon made himself master of Dieppe and Montreuil; while he himself received the submission of all the country as far as Ponthoise, Beauvais, and Abbeville. Hitherto the duke of Burgundy had hesitated between motives of self-interest and affection for his country; but now the progress of Henry determined him in favour o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his duty. He resolved to reconcile himself in good earnest with the dauphin, that the force of the kingdom might be united against the common enemy. But he found this a very diffiult task; for such was the hatred of young Charles towards the duke, that he chose rather to run the risque of being deprived of his inheritance, than to sacrifice his private animosity to the advantage of the kingdom. The conferences were renewed at Louvieres, between his ambassa∣dors and the English commissioners; but the same difficulties that were started at Alençon now rendered the congress ineffectual; though it was agreed that the king and the dauphin should confer together personally. This interview, however, was postponed from time to time, till at length the dauphin took other measures, which prevented it entirely. Mean while Henry indulged him with a truce, from the twelfth day of February till Easter, for all the country situated between the Loire and the Seine, Normandy excepted. The duke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> of Burgundy, according to the laudable scheme he had projected, made a proffer of his friendship to the dauphin, with prof<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssions of the warmest cor∣diali<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y; and proposed an interview, that they might confirm their mutual re∣conciliation, and concert measures for the advantage of the kingdom. His proposal being rejected with disdain, the duke found himself reduced to the necessity of making peace with England. He forthwith sent notice to Henry, that king Charles was sincerely disposed to an accommodation, and desired an interview with him, when, with the assistance of their councils, they might regulate the conditions of the peace, and conclude the marriage which had been so long depending. Henry embraced the proposal without hesita∣tion, and even granted a truce for three months, that they might have leisure to settle the time, place, and manner, or ceremony, of the interview.</P>

<P>All France was justly alarmed at this resolution; because every person of intelligence foresaw that no peace could be made at such a con∣juncture, but what must have been of infinite prejudice to their country. Several noblemen interposed their best offices in procuring a reconciliation, or at least a suspension of animosity, between the dauphin and the duke of Bur∣gundy; and the first would have consented to a cessation of hostilities for three years; but the duke insisted upon its being limited to two months, during which he purposed to conclude an accommodation with Henry, should the dauphin continue averse to a coalition: thus the negotiation miscarried. At length the two kings agreed to meet under a magnificent tent pitched in the neighbourhood of Meulant: but as the disorder of Charles prevented him from appearing in person, it was stipulated that the queen and the duke of Burgundy should act as his proxies; that the duke of Brittany should be pre∣sent at the conferences; and that commissioners should be appointed on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth sides, to discuss the articles by themselves, that no dispute or altercation might arise between the principals. The dukes of Clarence and Gloucester were constituted the plenipotentiaries of Henry, who repaired to Mante, that

he might be near the place of conference, while the court of France removed to P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e for the same reason. From these two places the French and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h courts came every day to the congress; and at the first interview, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een of France was accompanied by her daughter Catherine, whose b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty made a deep impression upon the heart of the English monarch.

<P>The conferences turned upon three articles, which the English p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nipotentiaries proposed as preliminaries to the peace; namely, That the king <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f England should be p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in possession of all that was ceded to Edward III. by the treaty of Bretigny: That Normandy should be added to that cession: And that he should pos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull sovereignty of all that might be ceded to him by the treaty, without homage or dependence. The duke of Burgundy perceived, from the ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinacy of Henry's temper, that a direct opposition to these articles would at once put an end to the conference, which it was his interest to continue, as the only means of effecting a reconciliation with the dauphin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he therefore, without disputing the king's pretensions, delivered to him the counter-demands of France, which we shall mention separately, together w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Henry's answer to each apart. Charles demanded that the king of England should renounce his pretensions to the crown of France; and Henry agreed to renounce all but that which should be ceded by the treaty. Charles demanded that he would renounce Touraine, Anjou, Maine, and the sovereig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of Bretagne: but the king disapproved of this article. Charles demanded that the king of England should swear, in behalf of himself and his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ccessors, that he or they should at no time<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nor upon any cause what∣soever, receive the crown of France as transferred <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom any p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rson, what right soever he or she might pretend to have or convey: The king assented to this proposa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, on condit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on that his adv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsary would t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke an o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of the same na∣tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g the crown of England.

Charles demanded that as there were several places in Normandy which the king of England had not conquered, and which never∣the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess were to be ceded to him by the treaty, he would, in consideration of that cession, resign all the conquests he had made in other places; that each sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d be re-estab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>shed in the possession of his estate, wheresoever it might be s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuated; and that an alliance should take place between the two crowns:
<PB N="281" REF="2870"/>
The king approved of this article, on condition that the Scots and rebels should not be comprehended in the alliance. Charles demanded restitution of the six hundred thousand crowns given to king Richard II. as part of the stipulated portion of queen Isabel; as also the payment of four hundred thou∣sand crowns for the jewels of that princess, which were detained in England: The king consented that this sum should be balanced out of the arrears due for the ransom of king John; though he expressed his surprize that the French king should demand four hundred thousand crowns for the jewels of queen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<DIV4 N="46" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLVI.</HEAD>
<P>From the nature of these demands, it plainly appears that the difficulties might have been easily surmounted, if both parties had been earnest in their desire of peace: but at the same time they were sufficient to keep the treaty in suspence, as long as the duke of Burgundy should chuse to protract it for the furtherance of his designs. Henry actually believed that he was on the eve of a pacification, and invested the archbishop of Canterbury with full power to go to Paris, and in his name conclude the treaty with Charles. But his own arts were now retorted upon himself: he had often carried on nego∣tiations to amuse the duke and the dauphin; and now he himself became a dupe to the same policy. The duke's chief aim in the congress at Meulant, was to excite the apprehension of the dauphin; and it produced the desired effect. That young prince, alarmed at the near prospect of a peace so disad∣vantageous to France, and prejudicial to his own interest, consented to a re∣conciliation with the duke of Burgundy, as the only expedient that could pre∣vent such calamity; and, after divers private conferences between their con∣federates, they at length agreed to a coalition. On the eleventh day of July, they met on the road to Paris, where they embraced each other with seeming affection; and afterwards they signed and ratified a treaty, in which they mu∣tually engaged to love each other like brothers, and resist in common the damnable enterprize of the English, the antient enemies of the kingdom. This accommodation being effected, the duke of Burgundy altered his de∣portment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> at the conferences, which were still continued in Meulant. Fearing that Henry's desire of peace would surmount the difficulties he had already started, he added some new articles, to raise fresh obstructions, and expressed dislike to the demands of the king, which he said were vague, obscure, equi∣vocal, and unreasonable. He insisted upon Henry's accepting the offers of France, purely and simply, without entering into any sort of explanation; and even refused to allow those points which were already settled to be com∣mitted to writing. This alteration in his manner of acting, at length opened the eyes of Henry; the conferences were broke off abruptly, and each side prepared for the recommencement of hostilities. On the twenty-eighth day of July, the king detached the duke of Clarence and the earl of Huntingdon, with a body of troops to surprize Pontoise; and this enterprize was atchieved by scalade, with all the desired success. L'Isle Adam, who commanded in the place, found himself so suddenly attacked, that he could hardly escape with a small part of the garrison, the rest of which was either taken or cut in pieces. This was a very valuable acquisition to Henry, as it opened his way to the gates of Paris, from which it was distant only a few leagues, contained a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Juv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nal de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ursin.

The people of England were by this time tired of the war, which had already drained them of men and money; for the king had received divers large rein<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orcements from his own dominions since he landed in Normandy; and the parliament had granted aid upon aid, and subsidy after subsidy, until the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exclaimed that the conquest of France would ruin England.

<P>Embarrassed as he must have been by these considerations, he maintained his pretensions, without any signs of doubt or despondence; and even affected to declare that he would not be contented with the concessions of Charles to what he demanded at Meulant, without the addition of Pontoise, which he had conquered since that congress. In all probability he would have found it convenient to change his strain, had not the rancour and perfidy of the dauphin co-operated with his endeavours. Mean while he undertook the siege of Gisors, which he carried on with such vigour, that, notwithstanding the ad∣vantage of its situation in the midst of fens and marshes that rendered it very difficult of access, and a numerous garrison command by experienced officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> it was obliged to surrender upon capitulation. Chateau Galliard was reduced by the duke of Gloucester, after having made an obstinate defence for six months; and Roche-guyon, with the castle of Aumaule, was taken by a detach∣ment under the command of the earl of Warwick. Then Ivry fell into the hands of the English, together with the castles of Montjoye and St. Germaine∣en-laye; and lastly, he besieged and took Meulant, from whence he detached the duke of Clarence with a body of forces to the neighbourhood of Paris.</P>

<P>The dauphin, though seemingly reconciled to the duke of Bur∣gundy, still harboured in his heart that animosity which he had imbibed from his intancy; and which now, like a fire half smothered, glowed more intensely than before. He refused to appear at court while the duke maintained any in∣fluence in the council; and as he wanted to engross the administration into his own hands, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crupled at no means, how treacherous soever, for the accom∣plishment of that aim. He resolved to proceed by assassination, and to execute his purpose at Pouilly; but thought proper to postpone his design, because the duke was surrounded by a strong body of forces. The dauphin afterwards advancing at the head of twenty thousand men towards Montereau-sur-yonne, invited the duke to a conference on a bridge between the town and castle, where they might concert measures for the campaign against the English, and settle some other affairs of importance. The duke readily complied with his propo∣sal;
<PB N="283" REF="2890"/>
and though apprised on the road of the dauphin's design, rather than give a handle for a rupture, by exhibiting any marks of suspicion, he proceeded to the appointed place, where he was murdered by Tanneguy de Châtel and his accomplices. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monstr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</NOTE></P>

<P>After the celebration of the nuptials, the two courts set out together for Sens, which was already invested by the English and Burgundian forces. The dauphin had received a reinforcement of seven thousand Scots, com∣manded by John earl of Buchan. He had put strong garrisons into Melun, Montereau, Montarges, Meaux, and Compeigne: he had taken Pont de St. Esprit in Languedoc by assault, reduced Nismes, and appointed a rendezvous of all his forces at Bourges in Berry. Sens, after a resistance of ten days, sur∣rendered to Henry by capitulation. Then he marched to Montereau, where the duke of Burgundy had been assassinated. The town was taken by assault; but Guitrie, who commanded the garrison retiring into the castle, refused to surrender.

Though they had very little reason to be pleased with this pacification, they would not be so rash as to speak their real sentiments at such a conjuncture; but, on the contrary, unanimously decreed that the peace of Troye should be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

The dauphin, with his accomplices, being summoned to appear at the marble table, and paying no regard to the citation, were convicted, attainted, and condemned to perpetual exile; and he, on the other hand, appealed to God and his own sword from this sentence, as well as from all proceedings that might be carried on to his prejudice in the name of his father. He still preserved the title of regent, in which quality he transferred the parliament and university of Paris to Poitiers, where some members of those two bodies actually assembled; so that France at this period exhibited two kings, two queens, two regents, all the officers of the crown doubled, seven or eight marechals of France on each side, with two parliaments and two universities of Paris. Although Henry had been declared regent and heir of the crown by the Burgundian faction, which had the king in their power, the remote provinces, which had not been exposed to the English hostilities, still adhered to the dauphin, and even many places in the neigh∣bourhood of Paris; so that Henry had a difficult task to perform before the war could be extinguished, especially as he and his troops were extremely dis∣agreeable to the whole French nation. At this period the chiefs of the Armag∣nac party in Guienne, despairing of being able to maintain a war against Henry, who was now the acknowledged heir of France, sued for peace and pardon, which he willingly granted, after they had renounced the appeal which their ances<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs had made to the court of peers in France, during the reign of the third Edward.</P>

the Scots from the interest of the enemy. Having therefore appointed English commanders in the strong places he had taken, and constituted the duke of Exeter governor of Paris, he took the road to Rouen in Normandy, where he convoked an assembly of the states of that province, and received a considerable supply from the laity and clery.

<P>The duke of Clarence had marched with ten thousand men into Anjou, with a view to reduce that province, which adhered to the dauphin; being informed that seven thousand Scots, commanded by the earl of Bu∣chan, were encamped at Baugé, in such a straggling manner, that the van might be easily cut off before the rear could come to its assistance, he resolved to at∣tack them immediately; and, putting himself at the head of his horse, began his march, after having ordered the earl of Salisbury to follow with the rest of the forces. When the duke reached Baugé, he found some Scottish troops in∣trenched in a church-yard, and spent so much time in attempting to dislodge them, that the earl of Buchan being alarmed, assembled his forces, and marched up to their assistance. Clarence, instead of waiting for the earl of Salisbury, attacked the new-comers with great impetuosity, and performed many exploits of personal valour, until he was wounded in the face with a spear by a Scottish knight called Swinton, and afterwards killed with a truncheon by the earl of Buchan. His cavalry were totally routed, fifteen hundred left dead on the spot, among which number were the lord Roos, Sir John Grey, and Sir Gil∣bert Umfreville; and the earls of Huntingdon, Somerset, and Mortagne, the lord Fitzwalter, and many other persons of distinction, were taken prisoners. The earl of Salisbury did not come up 'till after the battle; but he favoured the retreat of the fugitives, and recovered the body of the duke of Clarence, whose death was justly regretted by all his countrymen. The dauphin was so well pleased with this victory, that he created the earl of Buchan constable of France; and that nobleman, in order to maintain the reputation he had ac∣quired, undertook the siege of Alençon, which the earl of Salisbury attempted to raise; but he was repulsed with some loss by the besiegers, though Buchan was afterwards obliged to abandon the enterprize for want of artillery. Ne∣vertheless,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monstrelet.</NOTE> the dauphin's party began to recover their spirits, and gained seve∣ral advantages over the Burgundians.

<P>These transactions induced Henry to hasten his return to France: but, in the mean time, his attention was employed on the affairs of parlia∣ment, which, meeting at the appointed time, chearfully confirmed the treaty of Troye, a peace so glorious for England, and granted a subsidy for the continuation of the war against the dauphin; but, at the same time, they pre∣sented an address to his majesty, in which they observed, that the conquest of France would be the ruin of England. During this session of parliament, seve∣ral wholesome laws were enacted; and, among the rest, it was decreed, that no ecclesiastic, appointed by the pope, should be admitted to a benefice with∣out the consent of the patron. This statute was a mortal blow to the clause Non Obstante, which had been so often used by the popes in the exercise of their usurped authority, with respect to the collation of benefices. Before the parliament broke up, a treaty was concluded and ratified between England and Genoa, which was very advantageous to Henry, as it deprived the French of a useful ally. His next care was, to persuade his prisoner, James king of Scotland, to recall the troops which had been sent over to France, under the command of the earl of Buchan; and that prince, in consequence of some pri∣vate stipulation with the king of England, laid his commands upon his sub∣jects, to quit the service of the dauphin; but the earl replied, that they did not think themselves bound, by any ties, to obey the orders of their king, while he remained in the hands of his adversary, and must be supposed to act from compulsion. This order of James, however, furnished Henry with a pretence for treating, as rebels, all the Scots that were taken in the service of the dauphin. By this time, the duke of Albany was dead, and succeeded in the regency of Scotland by his son Murdoc earl of Fife, who had been lately released from his captivity in England. It was since his a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cession to the mini∣stry, that the auxiliaries had been sent to France; and, therefore, he became disagreeable to the king of England, who, in order to encourage a party that should counterballance his interest in Scotland, permitted James to revisit his own country, on his giving security for his return, and assuring Henry he would do his endeavour to dissolve the alliance between Scotland and the dauphin.</P>

<P>Henry having thus finished the business that called him into England, appointed the duke of Bedford regent of the kingdom; and, leaving the queen pretty far advanced in her pregnancy, set sail for Calais, on the tenth day of June, with a new-raised army, amounting to thirty thousand men, the greater part of whom were archers. On his arrival at Calais, he detatched twelve hundred chosen horse, under the command of the earl of Dortset and lord Clifford, to the relief of the duke of Exeter, who was besieged in Paris by the dauphin: but when this reinforcement entered the city, he withdrew his forces, and, in a little time, undertook the siege of Chartres. The king hav∣ing sent off divers detatchments to reduce some castles in Picardy, which still held for the dauphin, marched in person with the rest of his army to Bois le Vincennes, and from thence went to Paris on a visit to his father-in-law. Un∣derstanding that the dauphin had invested Chartres, he directed his route to that place, in hope of deciding the dispute by a battle; but, as he ap∣proached, the other retired, and Henry pursued him for a considerable way, until perceiving that he could not undertake or draw him to an engagement,
<PB N="289" REF="2990"/>
he turned off to Dreux, which made no resistance, but surrendered at the first summons. After the reduction of this place, his army was so terribly afflicted with the dysentery, that he ordered them into quarters of refreshment, while he himself retured to Paris, where he formed the design of besieging Meaux, one of the most important places that owned the dauphin's authority; strongly fortified by art and nature, and provided with a numerous garrison, commanded by the bastard of Vaurus, who had distinguished himself by his activity and rancour against the Burgundians.</P>

<P>This place was invested by Henry on the sixth day of October, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iege lasted all the winter; during which, he lost a great number of men by the inclemency of the weather and fatigue, as well as by the valour of the besieged, who made incredible efforts in their own defence. The town was di∣vided into two parts, called the City and the Marché; the first of which was taken by storm in the winter; but the other was defended with infinite obsti∣nacy. The lord Cornwal's son, a youth of great expectation, and the earl of Dorset, lost their lives at this memorable siege, besides a great number of other gallant officers, in two successive assaults, that miscarried in spite of all Henry's conduct and intrepidity. At length, the garrison, being reduced to the utmost<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1422.</NOTE> extremity, after a defence of seven months, demanded a capitulation; but Henry, who was exasperated at their obstinacy, insisted upon their surrendering at discretion; he even excluded, from all hopes of mercy, the English, Scots, and Irish, who should be found among the defendants, with all those who had been concerned in the death of the duke of Burgundy. They were obliged to submit to such terms as he was pleased to impose. After he had taken possession of the town, he commanded three officers to be instantly beheaded, and the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tard of Vaurus to be hanged upon a tree, which was distinguished<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elmham<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Monftre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Rymer.</NOTE> by his name, because he had used it as a gibbet for the execution of all the Burgundians that fell into his hands.</P>

<P>While Henry was employed in the fiege of Meaux, he received the agreeable news of his queen's being safely delivered of a son at Windsor, who was baptized by the name of Henry, and lived to be one of the most unfortu∣nate monarchs that ever sat upon the throne of England. About the time that Meaux capitulated, the queen was in a condition to travel, and arrived in France, accompanied by the duke of Bedford, who left his brother Gloucester regent in his absence. The two courts joining at Bois de Vincennes, went to∣gether to Paris, to pass the Whitsuntide holidays. On the day of Pentecost, the two kings and queens dined together in public, with their crowns upon their heads; and the French, who wished well to their country, could not, without deep-felt sorrow, behold the king o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> England governing France with absolute authority. Their disgust was augmented by an arbitrary tax he im∣posed in relation to a new coinage, at which the Parisians murmured in vain. Their situation was no longer what it seemed to be a few years before, when they held the ballance between the two factions, and had it in their power to make either scale preponderate. While Henry enjoyed this recess from the fatigues of war, the dauphin made himself master of la Charité, opened the passage of the Loire, and afterwards invested Cosne on the same river, which agree<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to surrender, if not relieved by the duke of Burgundy, by the eighteenth day of August.</P>

<P>The duke's honour being thus engaged for the relief of the place, he sent to the king for a reinforcement of troops; and Henry gave him to under∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tand he would be there in person. He accordingly began his march for this purpose; but was attacked by a dysentery, which obliged him to halt at Senlis, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom whence he was carried to Bois de Vincennes, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter having bestowed the command of the troops upon the duke of Bedford, and ordered him to join the duke of Burgundy with all expedition. The dauphin being informed of their junction, and finding himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too weak to cope with them in the field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> retired behind the Loire, and the two dukes marched to Troye in Champagne. Mean while Henry's malady encreased to such a degree, that the physicians despaired of his recovery, and he began to prepare for death, with that courage and intrepidity by which he had never been forsaken. Feeling his last hour approaching, he sent for the dukes of Bedford and Exeter, the earl of War∣wick, and all the English no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lemen who happened to be in that neighbour∣hood, that they might hear his last instructions. Addressing himself to them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith an audible voice and chearful countenance, he observed that his reign, though short, had been glorious; that though his wars had occasioned a great deal of bloodshed, it could not be justly imputed to him; but to the French, who would not listen to equitable terms of accommodation: that with respect to himself, he could meet death without the least apprehension; but he could not help lamenting the fate of the prince his son, who, being an infant, could not finish the work he had so happily begun. He, therefore, conjured them, in the name of God, to unite their interests and zeal in behalf of that young prince who was born to be their sovereign; to watch over his education, and as much as lay in their power, console the queen in her affliction: he exhorted t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em to cultivate the friendship of the duke of Burgundy; to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain the pri∣soners who had been taken at Agincourt, until his son should be of age to as∣sume the reins of government; and whatever peace they might find it con∣venient to make with France, to preserve the sovereignty of Normandy to England. Finally, he expressed a desire that the duke of Bedford might be charged with the administration of France; and that the duke of Gloucester might govern England during the prince's minority.</P>

<P>Having spoke to this effect, he enquired of his physicians how long they thought he should live; when one of them kneeling by the bed-side, while the tears trickled down his cheeks, declared, that without a miracle, two hours would put an end to his life. He heard this dreadful sentence without the least emotion, and having made confession of his sins, ordered his chaplains to recite the seven penitential psalms. When they pronoun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d these words, "Rebuild the walls of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rusalem," he interrupted them, and declared, on the word of a dying prince, that his intention was to turn his arms against the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idels in the Holy Land, as soon as he should have established a solid peace with France. This exercise of devotion being ended, Henry expired on the thirty-first day of August, and in the thirty-fourth year of his age, after a glorious reign of nine years, four months, and eleven days. His body was conveyed to England, and interred at Westminster, among his ancestors, with such pomp and magnificence as befitted the splendor of his reign; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> the queen, in memory of such an illustrious consort, placed upon his monu∣ment his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue of silver as big as the life, which it perfectly resembled.
<PB N="291" REF="3010"/>
Henry was tall and slender, with a long neck, engaging aspect, and limbs of the most elegant turn. He excelled all the youth of that age in agility, and the exercise of arms; was hardy, patient, and laborious, and more capable of enduring cold, hunger, and fatigue, than any individual of his army. His valour was such as no danger could startle and no difficulty oppose: nor was his policy inferior to his courage. He managed the dissensions among his enemies with such address as spoke him consummate in the arts of the cabinet. He fomented their jealousies, and converted their mutual resentment to his own advantage. Henry possessed a self-taught genius, that blazed out at once without the aid of instruction or experience; and a fund of natural sagacity that made ample amends for these defects. He was chaste, temperate, mo∣dest, and devout, scrupulously just in his administration, and severely exact in the discipline of his army, upon which he knew his glory and success in a great measure depended. In a word, it must be owned he was without an equal in the arts of war, policy, and government. But we cannot be so far dazzled with his great qualities, as to overlook the defects in his character. His pride and imperious temper lost him the hearts of the French nobility, and frequently broke out in outrage and abuse; as at the siege of Melun, where he treated the marechal l'Isle d'Adam with the utmost indignity, although that nobleman had given him no other offence than that of coming into his presence in plain, though decent apparel. That his disposition was cruel, ap∣pears too plainly from the massacre of the prisoners at Agincourt; from his behaviour to the garrisons of Rouen, Melun, and other places, which he found difficulty in reducing; as well as from the persecution of the Lollards, which could not have been countenanced by a prince of humanity. Those un∣happy wretches seem to have been sacrificed to his interest, as well as to his religious bigotry; for they were so many victims, by which he rendered the clergy propitious to his aims. All his renown was founded upon the most pernicious ambition, which seemed to swallow up every principle of justice, and every consideration of humanity. He could not but know the weakness of that title in support of which he shed the blood of two hundred thousand men, ruined a still greater number of families, laid waste the fairest provinces of Europe, and encouraged, nay bribed with offers of friendship and alliance the first noblemen in France, to renounce their allegiance and betray their country. It must be owned, indeed, that these were the vices of the times rather than of Henry. Europe was not yet humanized from the savage man∣ners of the northern barbarians, by which it had been over-run; and it may not be amiss to observe, that from the conquest of England by William of Normandy to the period of which we now treat, the throne had not been filled with one prince whose reign was not marked with such acts of cruelty or perfidy as would fix an indelible stain of infamy on any modern character. This was likewise the case of all the neighbouring nations, which seem to have been ruled by princes of the same family and complexion. Without im∣bibing any tincture of the liberal arts, which enlarge the faculties of the soul, and determine it to pursuits more worthy of humanity; without being taught the lessons of universal benevolence and true morality, the sole objects of their education were war and superstition. They were trained up in maxims of ar∣bitrary power, that considered the bulk of mankind as slaves subservient to
<PB N="292" REF="3020"/>
their interest and ambition: They were taught from their infancy to be∣lieve that the most flagrant crimes might be expiated by benefactions to the church; and that common injustice and usurpation were sufficiently atoned by a regular performance of religious exercise. Henry had been encouraged and exhorted by his prelates to undertake the war with France. In his last moments he appealed to heaven for the justification of his conduct. He had attacked the kingdom of France without the least provocation: he had filled it with widows and orphans, lamentation, misery, and every species of distress; and yet he died in full conviction of having acted according to the dictates of equity. There is no room to suspect him of dissimulation at such a juncture; and those who are acquainted with the human mind, will conceive how easily conscience is brought over to espouse the cause of any ruling passion.</P>

<P>THE death of Henry V. was no sooner known than the duke of Glou∣cester, who exercised the office of guardian, issued writs in the name of young Henry, for a parliament to meet on the ninth day of November at Westminster; and in the mean time the young king, being about nine months old, was proclaimed at London. The parliament meeting at the appointed time, payed no regard to the verbal declaration of the late king, appointing Gloucester regent of England. They vested this high trust in his elder brother John duke of Bedford; though Humphrey was allowed to act in his absence. The duke of Bedford was therefore chosen protector, defender of the realm and the church of England, and the king's principal counsellor, with a salary of eight thousand marks to support the dignity of that office. At the same time they appointed a council, by whose advice all the affairs of the kingdom were to be administred; the protector, in their deliberations, having no other prerogative than that of a deciding voice, in case of an equal division. This important point being established, they made some other regulations touching sheriffs, bailiffs, and justice of the peace; and having continued the tonnage and poundage, with the subsidy on wool, for two years longer, were dissolved. Before they broke up, however, they appointed governors to take charge of the king's person and education. These were Thomas Beaufort duke of Exeter, and his brother Henry bishop of Winchester, the king's great uncles. This last was a prelate of great wealth, arrogance, and ambition; and by this office he acquired great influence in the councils of England; and even surpassed the duke of Gloucester in credit. There seemed to be a contest between them in point of authority, which turned out very prejudicial to the interest of their sovereign. The duke of Gloucester had scarce taken possession of his new dignity, when he married Jaquelina daughter of William V. duke of Bavaria, and heiress of Hainault, Holland, Zealand, and Friesland. She had been married to John dauphin of France, and after his death compelled by her mother to wed the duke of Brabant, whose person she detested. Indeed they seemed to hate one another; and after they had lived together some time in continual dissen∣tion, she made an elopement to England, where she was hospitably received by the late king, and applied to the pope for a divorce; but as this could not be obtained, she gave her hand to the duke of Gloucester, by virtue of a licence from the antipope Benedict; and this preposterous marriage was pro∣ductive of a great mischief to England.</P>

<P>Charles VI. of France survived his son-in-law but fifty days<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and his death produced a total revolution in the affairs of that kingdom. Many French noblemen, who thought it their duty to obey the king, without examining nar∣rowly
<PB N="295" REF="3050"/>
whether or not his conduct was for the advantage of their country, now believed themselves under the same obligation to the dauphin, notwithstanding the treaty of Troye, which was the effect of violence and compulsion. The duke of Bedford was not ignorant of their sentiments; and therefore the eyes of Charles were no sooner closed, than he proclaimed Henry, king of France, and assumed the title of regent, according to the appointment of his late brother Henry king of England. He then assembled all the French noblemen who ad∣hered to the English interest, and they took the oath of allegiance to young Henry; which was likewise exacted of all the towns that were under the domi∣nion of the English. After this ceremony the council of France and the city of Paris sent deputi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to London, to congratulate the young king upon his ac∣cession to both crowns; and they had instructions to pass through t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Low Countries, and exhort the duke of Burgundy to continue firm to the articles of his alliance.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>While the duke of Bedford took these necessary precautions in behalf of his nephew, the dauphin, who was at Espaly, an house belonging to the bi∣shop of Puy, caused himself to be immediately proclaimed king of France, and repaired to Poitiers, where he was cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crated in the beginning of Novem∣ber. He possessed all Languedoc, Dauphiné, Berry, Auvergne, Toutaine, part of Saintonge, the town of Rochelle, and Poitou; and besides these pro∣vinces he looked upon Provence, Maine, and Anjou, as countries on whose attachment he might depend. On the other hand, Henry's interest preváiled in Normandy and Guienne, Picardy, Champagne, Brie, the Isle of France, and the city of Paris, besides the two Burgundies, Flanders, and Artois,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Monf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>relet.</NOTE> which belonged to the duke of Burgundy, who was his vassal and ally. Such being the situation of affairs, the war might have been carried on in all the pro∣vinces of France, except Bretagne, which observed an exact neutrality; though the scene of action was chiefly confined to Picardy, Champagne, La Brie, and the Isle of France; because the English were desirous of expelling the dauphin's garrisons from these provinces, before they would carry the war to the other side of the Loire; and it was the interest of Charles to make his chief efforts i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those countries, that his enemies might be prevented from penetrating into the more southern provinces. John V. duke of Bretagne still adhered to his neu∣trality, as well as his brother Arthur count de Richemont; though both leaned towards the English interest. The duke of Burgundy resolved to observe punc∣tually the articles of his alliance, on account of his personal hatred to Charles, who had murdered his father. Lewis III. duke of Anjou and king of Sicily<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> espoused the cause of Charles, who had married his sister. The count de Foix and his brothers declared for the English; though they afterwards changed their party. The houses of Armagnac and Albert had made their peace with Henry V. but now they engaged in the interest of Charles. The duke of Or∣leans and his brother the count de Angouleme, were both prisoners in Eng∣land; but Charles was assisted by their friends, adherents, and influence. The same party was embraced by John duke of Alen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and his b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other Peter the Bastard, who was counted one of the best warriors in the kingdom. John duke of Bourbon being prisoner in England, could have no personal share in these contests; but his eldest son, the count of Clermont, was strongly attached to Charles, for whose service he maintained all the places belonging to the duke

<P>After the death of Charles VI. which happened on the twenty-first day of October, the season would not permit the troops on either side to undertake any action of great importance, except the siege of St. Valery, which was sur∣rendered to the English on capitulation. Bussi in the county of Guise, was likewise taken by the count de Ligni, general of the Burgundians, while Jaque de Harcour and Lahire reduced La Rue in Picardy, and Vitry in Cham∣pagne, to the dominion of Charles. The duke of Bedford, in pursuance of the plan which his brother Henry had projected, resolved to subdue all the places possessed by Charles on this side the Loire; and while he was employed in making preparations for executing this plan, Graville, one of the officer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Charles, surprized Meulan by scalade, on the fourth day of January. As this<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1423<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> place was situated within six leagues of Paris, and the reduction of it u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der his eye an insult offered to his arms, he determined to begin the campaign with the siege of it, which he accordingly undertook in person in the beginning of February. Charles ordered the count d'Aumale to join the Scottish auxiliaries under general Stuart, and march to its relief; but these officers disputing the chief command with each other, parted without having undertaken any thing in favour of Meulan, which Graville was obliged to surrender on capitulation. After the reduction of this place, the regent repaired to Amiens, where he had an interview with the dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne, which last together with his brother the count de Richemont, signed a league and confederacy against Charles; and this alliance was cemented by a marriage between Bedford and Anne sister of the duke of Burgundy; while the count de Richemont mar∣ried an elder sister of the same prince, who was widow of the dauphin Lewis.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

In the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an time the earl of Salisbury, being appointed governor of Champagne and Brie, invested the strong castle of Montaign; and leaving the earl of Suffolk to com∣mand the blockade of that fortress, undertook in person the siege of Vertus, Sesanne, and Epernay, which he reduced without difficulty.</P>

<P>While he was engaged in these operations, Charles ordered Tannegui de Châtel to march to the relief of Montaign; but Salisbury, being apprised of his intent, joined Suffolk with such expedition, that the French general was almost surprized, and retreated into Burgundy, whither he was pursued by the English forces. Salisbury, finding he could not overtake the French, invested Crevant, a strong place situated upon the Yonne, about three leagues above Auxerre. Charles then commanded Stuart to withdraw some troop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the neighbouring garrisons, and join Châtel, in order to attempt the relief of the town. All these forces when joined amounted to ten thousand, of which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he marechal de Severac took the command; but before the junction was effected, Salisbury had made himself master of Crevant, and returned to the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ege of Montaign. Though the French army could not prevent the reduction of Cre∣vant, they resolved to retake it immediately, and marched thither with all ex∣pedition.
<PB N="298" REF="3080"/>
The d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tchess dowager of Burgundy being then at Dijon, ordered the marechal Toulongeon to assemble the militia and gentlemen of that neigh∣bourhood; and desired the earl of Salisbury to join them with his forces, and attempt to raise the siege. That nobleman complied with her request, and set out for Auxerre, at the head of six thousand chosen troops; there, joining the Burg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndians, they directed their route to Crevant; and the army of Charles, being apprised of their march, took post upon a mountain, from whence they could not easily be dislodged. The English and Burgundians made a feint, as if they had intended to pass the river Yonne at Cologne-le-Vimeux; upon which the French quitted the ground, and posted themselves on the bank of the river, in order to dispute the passage. The two armies faced one another for two hours on different sides of the river, till, at length, a body of English, passing by a bridge, maintained their ground against the efforts of the whole French army, until all their countrymen, and the Burgundians, had made their passage good. Then they attacked, in their turn, with such impetuo∣sity, that the marechal de St. Severac could not sustain the assault, but retired, with his French forces, leaving the Scots under Stuart to bear the brunt of the whole battle. They fought, for a considerable time, with great obstinacy, until they were overpowered, and obliged to quit the field with the loss of twelve hundred men, who were killed upon the spot, or taken prisoners. Stuart and Xaintrailles, with about forty officers of distinction, fell into the hands of the English, who did not obtain a bloodless victory; for above four hundred of their best men lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t their lives in the engagement; and among these Sir John<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> Grey, Sir William Kalk, Sir Gilbert Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>el, and Richard ap Madock.</P>

<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>After this victory, the earl of Salisbury returned to the blockade of Montaign, the garrison of which being, by this time, reduced to twenty men, capitulated; and he ordered the fortifications to be razed. Then he divided his forces with the earl of Suffolk, who made himself master of Macon, while Salisbury finished the conquest of Champagne; from whence he marched into the i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of France, where he reduced Coucy, and some other cattles. During these transactions, the regent ordered Ralph de Boutieller to besiege Crotoy in Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ardy, situated on the Somme, opposite to St. Valery, and commanded by Jaques de Harcour, who, after having made a gallant defence, agreed to surrender by the first of March, if not relieved before that time; and, as Charles made no at∣tempt in his favour, he surrendered accordingly to the duke of Bedford. Tho' Charles was but very ill supplied with money, he payed the ransom of Xain∣trailles, who no sooner recovered his liberty, than he found means to surprize Ham and Guise, while La Hire took Compeigne in the same manner: but all these places were immediately retaken by the troops of the regent and the duke of Burgundy. About this period, Charles received a reinforcement of a thou∣sand men at arms, and five hundred lances, from Philip Maria Visconti duke of Milan; and these troops entering the Bajolois, not only prevented the town of la Boussiere from falling into the hands of Toulongeon, but also sur∣prized that general, who was taken prisoner, with seven hundred men, whom he had brought to take possession of the fortress, according to capitulation; but he was immediately exchanged for Stuart, who had been taken at Crevant.</P>

<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>This small advantage was followed by another of greater conse∣quence to Charles. John de la Pole, brother to the earl of Suffolk, with a body of troops, drawn from different garrisons, had fallen into Anjou, where he burned the suburbs of Angers, and obtained a considerable booty: but, in his return to Normandy, he was intercepted by the count d'Aumale, the young duke of Alençon, Loheac, Coutonge, and the bastard of Alençon, who had assembled a strong body of troops to cut off his retreat. They came up with him at Graville in Le Maine, where, after an obstinate dispute, he was de∣feated, and taken prisoner, and fourteen hundred of his men killed on the field of battle. This victory revived the hopes of Charles, which the battle of Crevant had well nigh extinguished; and, what inspired him with fresh confi∣dence, was the arrival of five thousand men, whom the earl of Buchan, at this period, brought from Scotland, under the command of Archibald earl of Douglas, one of the most renowned warriors of the age. These succours ar∣rived<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> at Rochelle at a very seasonable juricture for Charles, who caressed the Scottish officers in a very extraordinary manner. Douglas was created duke of Touraine; Stuart honoured with the title of baron d'Aubigny, and afterwards made count d'Evreux: Charles chose a company of Scots for the guard of his own person, as a mark of his confidence and esteem. To crown this succession of favourable events, the count de Richemont being af∣fronted by the regent, who refused to trust him with the command of the army, resolved to detach his brother, the duke of Brittany, from the English interest; and, by the mediation of the duke of Savoy, a truce was concluded between Charles and the duke of Burgundy, for the Lionnois and Burgundy, which, as well as the neighbouring provinces of France, were terribly distressed by the interruption of commerce.</P>

<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>While France was thus exposed to all the miseries of war, England enjoyed the most profound tranquility. The parliament meeting on the twen∣tieth day of October, a new council was appointed for the government of the realm, by the intrigues of the bishop of Winchester, who, having quarreled with the duke of Gloucester, raised an opposition in parliament, with a view to curb the protector's powers, by enlarging those of the council, which were accordingly augmented. This affair being settled, the ministry laid before both houses, the state of a negotiation with the Scots, touching the ransom of king James; and the parliament approved of the steps which had been taken. A law was enacted against the exportation of gold and silver out of the kingdom, except what was barely necessary for the payment of the troops in France, and a subsidy was granted for the maintenance of the war in that country.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Gloucester and the council perceiving, that the Scottish nation adopted other maxims than those they had pursued under the regency of the late duke of Albany; and that they exerted themselves in behalf of the French king, with a spirit that seemed to be the result of their resenting their own king's captivity, resolved, in good earnest, to set James at liberty, on such condi∣tions as would attach him to the interest of England. His subjects were ex∣tremely desirous of seeing him return, and take the administration of the realm from Murdoc duke of Albany, who was a weak prince, without resolution or authority; and several negotiations had been set on foot for the release of their lawful sovereign: but hitherto they had proved ineffectual, because the Eng∣lish
<PB N="300" REF="3100"/>
thought it their interest to detain him in their power<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> supposing, that while he remained in captivity, his subjects would take no material steps to the prejudice of England. By this time, however, they had found themselves mistaken in their conjecture, and saw no expedient so likely to put an end to the alliance between France and Scotland, as that of dismissing king James in terms of friendship with England. Safe-conducts were granted to the Scottish commissioners to come to London, in order to treat about their king's deli∣verance; and the bishops of Durham and Worcester, the earls of Northum∣berland and Westmoreland, the lords Nevil, Cornwal, and Chaworth, were ap∣pointed as deputies to discuss the articles. They were impowered, by their instruc∣tions, to consent to the release of James, on condition, that he should pay forty thousand marks for the expence of his maintenance during his captivity in Eng∣land: and that he should conclude a truce with Henry, during which, the two kings should not assist the enemies of each other. They were likewise desired to insinuate, that this peace might be happily cemented by a marriage between the king of Scotland, and some English lady of the blood<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>royal. The first conference was held at York, when the plenipotentiaries agreed upon the ar∣ticles of the king's release; and, in the second at London, they regulated the manner in which the sum should be payed, together with the quality of the hostages to be left by way of security. There too, it was stipulated, that the king of Scotland should espouse Jane of Somerset, sister to the duke of that name, and niece to the duke of Exeter and bishop of Winchester; and that Henry's council should abate ten thousand marks of the sum, in consideration of this marriage. Then the commissioners of both nations signed a truce for seven years, by which James engaged to recal his troops from France before the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> month of May next ensuing; tho' he could not answer for their obedience. This treaty was confirmed by the parliament, which was prorogued from De∣cember to January; and, James, after a captivity of seventeen years, returned to his own country.</P>

<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>The war in France was still maintained with various success; and the regent exerted all his activity and conduct in attempting to clear the nor∣thern provinces of the troops and adherents of Charles; but he found this a very difficult task; for he had no sooner reduced one place by force, than the enemy took another by surprize; so that his labour seemed to be endless and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1424.</NOTE> ineffectual. While he was employed in the reduction of several little castles in the isle of France, he received intelligence that Giraut, one of the officers of Charles, had surprised Ivry, a place of importance, on the frontiers of Nor∣mandy; and he forthwith marched thither to retake it, before the French could have time to put it in a proper posture of defence. The siege was undertaken in the beginning of July, and Giraut capitulated to surrender, if not relieved by the fifteenth day of August. Charles, being informed of this agreement, resolved to succour the place, though at the hazard of a battle; and immedi∣ately assembled an army in Le Maine, consisting of twenty thousand men, Scots, French, and Italians. The command naturally belonged to the earl of Buchan, as constable of France; but he yielded that honour to his father∣in-law the earl of Douglas, whom Charles constituted his lieutenant-general for the whole kingdom. All the nobility, who adhered to Charles, joined the army on this occasion, in order to signalize their courage; and, on the
<PB N="301" REF="3110"/>
twelfth day of August, they marched by the walls of Vernueil, which was in possession of the English. Next day they came in sight of the regent's army, which was so strongly intrenched before Ivry, that Douglas deemed the at∣tack impracticable, and marched back towards Vernueil, which surrendered on the first summons, supposing that the English army was defeated, and the siege of Ivry raised, according to the report of the messenger.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>The earl of Salisbury being apprised of the enemy's march, hastened to the regent with a reinforcement of a thousand men at arms, and two thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rchers, which augmented the number of the English to thirteen thousand vete∣rans, who were more than a match for the like number of any troops in Europe. Ivry was surrendered at the appointed time, according to the capitulation; and next day the duke of Bedford marched towards Vernueil, in order to bring the enemy to a battle. He halted at the distance of a league from their camp, and sent an herald with a defiance, and a particular message to Douglas, import∣ing, that he was come to dine with him: To this the other replied, that he should be welcome, and find the cloth ready laid. The regent, instead of proceeding to the attack, pitched upon a convenient spot for a field of battle, flanked by a hill, on which he posted two thousand archers; and he provided his soldiers with sharp stakes, like those that were used at Agincourt, to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist the French cavalry, among which he knew there was a great number of young noblemen, who would not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail to attack him on the ground he h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d chosen for his own advantage: nor was he mistaken in his notion of that headstrong im∣petuosity, by which the French had lost so many decisive battles. Douglas having, in person, observed the English camp, assembled a council of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and represented, that as the duke of Bedford had chosen his own ground, where he could not be attacked without manifest disadvantage, their business was to maintain their post, and n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t hazard a battle, in which the king's in∣terest must run an unnecessary risque.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>This salutary advice, which the constable, and all the officers of ex∣perience, approved, was vehemently opposed by Aymerviscount of Navbonne, who treated it as the effect of timidity, and declaimed upon the glory of France, and the disgrace that would be entailed upon the arms of the king, should they avoid an engagment, when they were so superior to the enemy in number. He was se∣conded by all the young nobility; and the council was filled with tumult and debate: at length this rash, unthinking nobleman, exclaimed, "Let those who love the "king follow me;" then, rushing from the council, attended by those who es∣poused his opinion, he drew up his men in order of battle, and commanded them to display his banner. Douglas and the constable finding all their remonstrances ineffectual, and their authority despised, resolved to do their utmost endeavours to support those headstrong adventurers; or, if that should prove ineffectual, to wash out, with their own blood, the stain which had been so unjustly thrown upon their honour. With this view they endeavoured to form their troops, but the viscount of Narbonne, and his associates, had already began their career, and the rest of the army followed them in such a tumultuous manner, that it was found impossible to bring them under any regularity of rank or discipline, while the two chiefs were hurried along with the multitude. By that time the English camp appeared in view, their breath and spirits were almost exhausted; and here the generals made another effort to reduce them to order, by exhort∣ing
<PB N="302" REF="3120"/>
them to halt, and recover breath before they should begin the battle; but they still lent a deaf ear to all their intreaties; and the French and Scots vied with each other, in rushing foremost to the scene of their destruction. The Ita∣lians having received a shower of arrows from the English archers that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anked them upon the hill, betook themselves to flight in the very beginning of the onset; but the rest of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> army charged with incredible impetuosity, so as to disorder one of the wings of the English. They even broke through them as far as a barricade formed in the rear with the waggons of the army, behind which was posted a body of archers that received them with a terrible discharge. When they wheeled, in order to attack these bowmen on the flanks, they found them defended by their stakes, in such a manner, that they could make no impression; while they themselves were so exposed to the flights of arrows, that few or none of them escaped with life from this encounter. Mean while the main bodies of both armies fought with such equal fury and resolu∣tion, that, for three hours, it was impossible to discern any advantage on ei∣ther side; at length, the English body of reserve, which had defeated the Ita∣lian men at arms and French cavalry, fell upon the flank of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ots, and decided the fortune of the day. Douglas and the constable seeing their over∣throw inevitable, scorned to outlive the disaster, and, rushing into the hottest part of the battle, fell in the midst of their enemies. This was likewise the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate of the indiscreet Narbonne, Ventadour, Graville, and Rambouillet. The other principal officers were so grievously wounded, that they could no longer act; so that the me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, being deprived of their leaders, fought at random, until they were ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted and dispersed with great slaughter. The Italians, who had quitted the field in the beginning of the engagement, being informed that the French had the advantage, returned for their share of the plunder, and were received by the victorious English in such a manner, that not a man would have escaped alive, had not they been favoured by the night. Five thousand Scots and French were left dead upon the field of battle, and a great number was wounded and taken; among others, the marechal de la Fayette and Gau∣cour; and the young duke of Alençon, being found still breathing, was ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rished with such care by the regent, that he recovered of his wounds, which were extremely dangerous. This victory, though of infinite importance to the regent, was not purchased cheaply; inasmuch as he lost seventeen hun∣dred of his best men, who fell in the field; and, among these, some officers of dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Next day the duke of Bedford invested Vernueil, the garrison of which was commanded by Rambure, who being but very ill provided with necessaries, surrendered in three days on capitulation. In this place the Eng∣lish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound all the baggage belonging to the French, Scottish, and Italian ge∣nerals, together with the money destined for the pay of the soldiers; and, meet∣ing with the corpse of the viscount Narbonne, on the way to interment, they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paul.

<P>After the victory at Vernueil, the duke of Bedford returned to Paris to quell an insurrection which had been raised in that city, on the supposition that he would be defeated; while the earl of Salisbury reduced the city of Mans, St. Susanne, and La-ferté Bernard, and finished the conquest of Le Maine. All the places that favoured Charles were now filled with consterna∣tion;
<PB N="303" REF="3130"/>
and all his friends began to despair of his cause. He himself, though a prince of great vivacity and perseverance, would in all probability have yielded to the torrent of misfortune, had not the approach of winter afforded him some respite from the pursuit of his enemies. But even the winter would not have prevented his ruin, if another unexpected event had not intervened. This was no other than a quarrel between the dukes of Burgundy and Gloucester, which without all question preserved the crown of France to the house of Valois. We have already observed that the duke of Gloucester had married Jaquelina, heiress of Hainault, even during the life of her other husband the duke of Brabant, who was first cousin to the duke of Burgundy. This last prince foreseeing that such a marriage would be productive of animosity and war be∣tween the two husbands, had a conference on the subject with the duke of Bedford at Amiens, and afterwards another at Paris, where they agreed in opinion that the affair ought to be left to the decision of the pope, who was the natural judge in all such causes. The duke of Brabant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssented to the pro∣posal, in full confidence that his holiness would see no cause to annul his mar∣riage with J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lina; but the duke of Gloucester refused his assent for the same reason, though he professed himself inclined to a reasonable accommo∣dation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>The affair continued in suspence till the battle of Vernueil; after which the duke of Gloucester crossed the sea to Calais, with his wife, and a body of five thousand men, to wrest Jaquelina's dominions from the hands of the duke of Brabant. His design was altogether a secret to the duke of Bur∣gundy, who believed he was come to reinforce the regent; he was therefore not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little surprized when he heard, during his residence at Dijon, that the duke of Glouce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter had traversed part of his dominions; and that all the towns of Hainaul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had submitted and taken the oath of allegiance to him and Jaquelina. He forthwith ordered his generals Ligni and l'Isle Adam to assemble an army, and join the count of St. Pol, who was employed at Brussels in raising forces for the service of his brother the duke of Brabant. How unseason∣able for England this rupture with the duke of Burgundy must have been, will appear, when we observe that the affairs of Charles were at this juncture in a desperate condition. The battles of Crevant and Vern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cil had deprived him of his best troops and generals. He was without money and credit, ut∣terly incapable of bringing an army into the field. The dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne, the most powerful vassals of his crown, were intimately con∣nected with the English. His brother-in-law the king of Sicily had lost L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Maine, and could hardly preserve his other dominions; and the king of Scot∣land, the ancient ally of France, was by his truce with England hindered from supplying him with a reinforcement. Reduced to this melancholy situation, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw himself repulsed to the other side of the Loire, and in imminent dan∣ger of being hunted out of the provinces of Berry, La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guedoc, and Da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the English gave him no other title than that of count of Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thieu, or king of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges, in derision. The duke of Bedford was sensible of all his advantages, and knew that if his brother Gloucester would have, at this criti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l period, joined him with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he forces and money he had brought to Calais, the conquest of Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would have been finished in one camp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign.

<P>In the orders which the duke of Burgundy issued to his generals for levying troops in favour of his kinsman the duke of Brabant, he declared that this prince had agreed to the expedient proposed, with the consent of the duke of Bedford; and that Gloucester had rejected the equitable proposal. Hum∣phrey, incensed at this assertion, wrote a letter to him from Mons, in which he taxed him with having advanced what was not strictly conformable to truth. The duke of Burgundy, in his answer, gave him the lie, and offered to main∣tain his assertion in single combat, to be judged by his own brother the duke of Bedford. Gloucester accepted the challenge; the festival of St. George was fixed for the day of trial; and in the mean time, those two princes in∣sulted each other in the most outrageous manner, both by letters and mes∣sages. In this interval, the count of St. Pol besieged and took the little town of Braine in Hainault; putting the English garrison to the swo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, notwithstand∣ing the capitulation, and then reduced the place to ashes. Nevertheless, as the quarrel between the dukes of Gloucester and Brabant might be terminated by the combat between Humphrey and the duke of Burgundy, they agreed to a truce until that affair should be decided, and Gloucester returned to Eng∣land. He would have carried his duchess along with him, had not the inha∣bitants of Mons desired, with the most earnest intreaties, that she might be permitted to remain in that city. He could not resist their pressing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollicita∣tions; but he exacted a solemn oath of the magistrates, that they would de∣fend<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>relet.</NOTE> her at the hazard of their lives against all her enemies.</P>

<P>Charles, in order to make his advantage of these dissensions, en∣deavoured to detach the dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne from the interests of the English. He knew that the count de Richemont was incensed against the duke of Bedford, who had refused to confer upon him the command of the army: he was well acquainted with the pride and vanity of that nobleman; and these, by proper emissaries, he flattered in such a manner, that the count agreed to accept of the conftable's office, vacant since the death of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chan; and even undertook to bring over his brother the duke of Bretagne to the interest of Charles, provided that prince would banish Louvet from his councils, and procure the consent of the duke of Burgundy to his engaging in the king's service. Charles accordingly declared him constable of France, as the duke did not object to this promotion; but this prince, though irritated against the duke of Gloucester, and the English in general, had not so entirely forgot his father's assassination, as to listen to the proposals of the king, who had sent the bishops of Puy and Chartres, to detach him, if possible, from the interest of Henry. They endeavoured to excuse Charles with regard to his father's death, by saying he was misled by evil counsellors; and the duke took this opportunity to tell them, that when his majesty should have banished those
<PB N="305" REF="3150"/>
evil counsellors from his presence, it would then be a proper time to talk of accommodation. These were Tann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gui de Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el and Louvet, who still main∣tained the foremost place in his favour. The first being apprized of the duke's declaration, insisted upon being dismissed from the service; and Charles granted his request with great reluctance: but the other was not so honest as to sacri∣fice his own private advantage to his master's interest. He not only enjoyed a large share of his sovereign's favour; but his credit was corroborated by the influence of his daughter, married to the lord of Joyeuse, who, with the fa∣mous Agnes Sorel, divided the affection of Charles. Louvet thus supported, set the new constable at defiance; and the court was immediately split into two factions, which greatly obstructed their sovereign's interest. Charles him∣self espoused the cause of Louvet; but the nobility adhered to the constable; and when he retired from court in disgust, declaring he would never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturn while his antagonist should retain his office, they withdrew to their respective countries, and the king found himself almost totally abandoned. Then he was obliged to sacrifice his minister, and make concessions to the constable, who not only resumed his place, but also performed his promise, in bring∣ing over his brother the duke of Bretagne, who did homage to Charles at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. de Char.

<P>The court of Henry was as much disturbed by faction as that of Charles. The duke of Gloucester, and his uncle the bishop of Winchest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, hated each other with implacable rancour. That prelate had opposed with all his might the expedition to Hainault; though the duke's inter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st prevailed in the council: but, in the absence of Gloucester, the other acquired such in∣fluence, that when he returned, the bishop's credit seemed to preponderate. Their quarrel was immediately revived, and broke out in divers tumults and frays between their partisans. The bishop wrote a letter to the duke of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d∣ford, intreating him in the most earnest manner to return and reform the abuses occasioned by his brother's misconduct; and Gloucester drew up ar∣ticles of impeachment, to be presented against Winchester at the ensuing parlia∣ment. The duke of Bedford, finding his presence absolutely necessary in England, left the command of the army in France to the earl of Warwick, and arrived on the twentieth day of December in England, where he was received by the council and the nation, in quality of protector. In a few days after his return, he explained the state of affairs in France to the council; and, in par∣ticular, expatiated on the infidelity of the count de Richemont, and his bro∣ther the duke of Brittany, against whom war was declared by public procla∣mation, on the fifteenth day of January. The next affair which engrossed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the attention of the protector, was the quarrel between his brother and uncle, which he employed all his influence to accommodate. He convoked an as∣sembly<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1426.</NOTE> of the nobles at St. Alban's, that they might assist him in mediating a reconciliation, which was so necessary towards the preservation of the public peace; but all their endeavours proving ineffectual, the dispute was referred to the decision of parliament, which was already summoned to meet in March at Leicester. There the duke of Gloucester exhibited his articles of impeach∣ment, which being examined by a committee, appeared frivolous, and the bishop was acquitted. Then the parliament exhorted both parties to lay aside their mutual animosity; and they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbraced each other with exterior marks of

He expected a supply of money from De Giac, who had succ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eded Louvet in the management of the finances; but that minister fearing he would become in∣tolerably insolent, and govern the court according to his own fancy, should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e succeed in this enterprize, resolved to disappoint him in his expectation. The constable seeing his army diminish every day by desertion, conceived the most violent indignation against De Giac, and became almost frantic with the apprehension of being disgraced in his first military undertaking. At length, being alarmed with a false report that the enemies were on their march to the relief of the place, he resolved to give the assault, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh the breach was hardly practicable; and detached two thousand men upon the road to Avranche, in order to keep the English in play, should they come up during the attack. This disposition being made, he stormed the breach with great fury; but met with such a warm reception, that there was very little appear∣ance of his carrying the place by assault. The detachment seeing no enemy approaching, deserted their post, and returned to the camp, with a view to share in the glory and spoils of the day; and they came on in such confusion, that the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ailants concluded they were repulsed by the English army, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere instantly seized with c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsternation. They forthwith quitted the assault; and such was the pannic which prevailed among them, that all the constable's endeavours could not bring them back to the charge. The besieged per∣ceiving their disorder, made a furious sally, and fell among them with such impetuosity, that they fled with precipitation, leaving their baggage and ar∣tillery in the hands of the English.</P>

<P>Richemont was infinitely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortified at this disgrace, and so ex∣asperated against De Giac, to whom he imputed the disaster, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e vowed revenge against him, and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cuted it with the first opportunity. Having

rallied his forces, he fell into Anjou, where he reduced La Fleche and Gal∣lerande; and the campaign being ended, returned to court, where he caused De Giac to be strangled in his bed, and thr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn into the Loire; and publicly declared he would treat in the same manner, any man who should presume to engross the king's favour. Accordingly the Camus of Beaulieu, who ventured to accept of the place vacated by the death of De Giac, was in a few days assassinated in the king's palace by the direction of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erocious constable, who would suffer none to reside at court but such as depended entirely on his favour. Charles was so incensed at his insolence and presumption, that he not only re∣fused to see him, but even trembled with rage when his name was mentioned; nevertheless, such was the desporate situation of his affairs, that he had no other resource but his army of Bretons, and was therefore obliged to keep terms with Richemont.</P>

<P>The earl of Warwick, who commanded the English troops in the absence of the regent, was so weakened by the duke of Gloucester's war in Hai∣nault, that he had not forces sufficient to take the field against the constable: but now that the troops of Brittany were diminished by desertion, and the court of Charles was embroiled with dissensions, he assembled a body of five thousand men; and after having retaken some castles in Le Maine, which had fallen into the hands of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retons, he undertook the siege of Montargis, a place of great importance, situated on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver Loin, where it divides into three branches. His army being too inconsiderable to attack the town in form, he converted the siege into a blockade, and of consequence divided his forces into three bodies, separated by the branches of the river, over which, however, he threw wooden bridges of communication. These different divisions were commanded by him∣self, the earl of Suffolk, and John de la Pole, brother to that nobleman. The blockade had already continued three months, and the be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieged were reduced to extremity, when Charles desired the constable to attempt their relief; but his army being by this time dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anded, he would not expose himself to another disgrace with raw troops occasionally raised. What he declined was undertaken by the Bastard of Orleans, who, though no more than two and twenty years of age, had already given repeated p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oofs of extraordinary courage and conduct. He assembled about sixteen hundred men, and considently marched towards Montargis, upon an enterprize of the utmost difficulty, to be atchieved against the earl of Warwick, whose reputation was equal to that of the greatest gene∣rals. The besi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged had by this time opened their sluices, so as to overflow the bridges of communication between the English quarters; and the Bastard re∣solved to attack them separately before the water should subside. He gave one half of his troops to Lahire, with orders to attack the quarter of de la Pole, while <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e himself charged the earl of Suffolk. After an obstinate engagement the earl and his brother were defea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, with the loss of fifteen hundred men, the greater part of whom was drowned in the river; and the earl of Warwick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.

The place was immediately relieved; and this exploit was considered as an happy omen of the Bastard's future success: but this advantage was followed by no other operation of consequence; for both sides were so weak, that they thought proper to act on the defensive only.</P>

<P>The duel between the dukes of Gloucester and Burgundy had been put off by common consent; and in the mean time this last employed his emissaries among the people of Hainault, in order to form a party that should deliver Jaqueline into the hands of her lawful husband the duke of Bra∣bant. These negotiations being assisted by the princess's own mother, who was bia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed in favour of Burgundy, were attended with such success, that all of a sudden the towns of Hainault declared for the duke of Brabant; and his bro∣ther the count of St. Pol, presented himself at the head of an army before Mons, where the dutchess resided. The magistrates, feigning the utmost terror at his approach, declared themselves altogether incapable of defending the town, and entered into a treaty with him, by which it was stipulated that Jaqueline should be delivered into the hands of the duke of Burgundy, who should take charge of her person until the dispute could be terminated by the pope's decision. She was accordingly conducted to Ghent by the prince of Orange; and all the dutchy of Hainault unanimously acknowledged the duke of Brabant for their sovereign. The dutchess was extremely mortified at this treatment, and in letters to the duke of Gloucester, complained of having been villainously be∣trayed; but upon recollection she dissembled her chagrin, and even affected to wait the pope's sentence with chearful resignation. Her keepers, deceived by this appearance of good humour, relaxed in their vigilance; so that she found means to escape in disguise to Holland, where she was cordially received by some noblemen, while others declared for the duke of Burgundy, who began<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id.</NOTE> a war on her account that lasted two years without intermission.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1427.</NOTE> The war in France still languished, for want of men on both sides to undertake any enterprize of importance. The earl of Suffolk was surprized in Mans by the count d'Orval of the house of Albret, and obliged to take re∣fuge in a tower, from whence he was delivered by the gallantry of Talbot, who expelled the French in his turn; and after having taken Laval in Maine, joined the earl of Warwick, in order to carry on the siege of Pontorson, which had been reduced by the constable during the course of the preceding year. About this period the duke of Bedford arrived in France, with a reinforcement of troops that enabled him to execute schemes of importance. He was accompanied by the bishop of Winchester, who received the cardinal's hat at Calais with great solemnity; and, as being a prince of the blood, was afterwards distinguished by the name of Cardinal of England: in a little time after this promotion he was appointed the pope's legate in this kingdom; an office which enabled him to im∣prove his wealth and influence, to the prejudice and ruin of his enemy the duke of Gloucester. Mean while the court of Charles was more and more distracted by dissensions of the ministers and nobility. La Tremouille had now engrossed the king's favour; and though he had formerly professed friendship for the constable, he no sooner succeeded Beaulieu in the management of the finances, than he changed his conduct towards Richemont, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omented the king's aver∣sion to that nobleman. The other courtiers were incensed at his behaviour, on the supposition that there was no other person but the constable who could re∣establish the affairs of France; and they entered into a conspiracy against the life of the minister. The counts of Clermont and La Marche were at the head of this association, and assembled a body of forces, with which they endeavoured to surprize him at Bourges; but understanding that he had followed the king
<PB N="309" REF="3190"/>
to Loches, they resolved to seize his two creatures La Borde and De Prie, who fled for refuge into the great tower, which was immediately invested. De Prie was killed fighting in his own defence, but the other held out until he was relieved by the king in person. This quarrel degenerated into a civil war which raged several months, and was at last terminated by the mediation of the duke of Alençon, who had been taken at the battle of Verneuil, and lately ransomed for two hundred thousand crowns, a sum he could not raise without selling all his jewels, together with the town of Fougeres to the duke of Brit∣tany: but by this time the constable had retired in disgust to Vannes, and Charles had very little reason to hope for a continuation of his service and good offices. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE></P>

<P>The deplorable condition of Charles, destitute of forces, officers, and money, and embroiled in those domestic disquiets, furnished the regent with an opportunity to execute a scheme he had projected in England. Pontor∣son having surrendered after a long siege, he took the field in person, at the head of twenty thousand men, in order to fall upon Brittany, which he threatened with ruin and desolation. Whether the sovereign of that country was actually intimidated by the regent's menaces, or glad of a pretence for abandoning a sinking cause, which he espoused merely out of complaisance to his brother Richemont, he sent ambassadors to the duke of Bedford, solliciting peace on his own terms; and it was granted on condition of his swearing to observe the peace of Troye, and to do homage to young Henry, whenever it should be re∣quired. The duke of Brittany was agreeably surprized at this moderation of the regent, which he had no reason to expect; and Bedford was pleased with an opportunity to detach, by fair means, such a powerful ally from the inter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of Charles. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>While these revolutions happened in France, Jaquelina finding her∣self involved in a war with the duke of Burgundy, sollicited the duke of Glou∣cester for succours; and that prince, with the assistance of parliament, sent over a small reinforcement of troops, who immediately after their landing were defeated by the Burgundians. At length, by the intercession of the regent, the design of the duel was laid aside, and a truce concluded, during which Glou∣cester was prevailed upon to leave his dispute with the duke of Brabant to the pope's determination. His holiness, in a little time after this reference, pub∣lished his sentence, by which he annulled and dissolved the marriage between Jaquelina and the duke of Gloucester, and confirmed her former contract with the duke of Brabant, who did not long survive this arbitration. Upon the death of that prince, who was succeeded by his brother the count of St. Pol, Jaquelina ought to have retaken possession of her own territories; but the in∣trigues of the duke of Burgundy had such an effect upon her subjects, that they refused to acknowledge her for their sovereign; and the duke being chosen umpire between her and them, obliged her to put the government of her do∣minions into his hands, to constitute him her heir, and oblige herself to pass the rest of her days in a state of widowhood. The duke of Gloucester ac∣quiesced in the sentence of the pope; and though in all probability he would have revived his pretensions upon the death of the duke of Brabant, if the lady had been left unengaged, he was persuaded by his brother to desist from his claim, which, if pursued, would prove prejudicial to king Henry, by alienating

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of Warwick had returned to England, where he was appointed governor to the king in the room of the duke of Exeter lately decea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of Sal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bury arrived in France with a body of five thou∣sand men, whom he had raised at his own expence in England, in consequence of a convention with the council. As soon as he brought that reinforcement to Paris, the rege<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t bestowed upon him the command of an army amounting to sixteen thousand men, in order to reduce all the places that were possessed by Charles on this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide of the Loire, and to drive him intirely out of the northern provinces.

As it was necessary to reduce the neighbouring places, from which they might have been incommoded in the siege, the months of August and September were spent in subduing Jenville, Mehun, Baugenci, Gergeau, Clery, Sully, and other small places; and at length they appeared before Orleans on the twelfth day of October. Charles, perceiving the intention of the English, had supplied the place with great store of provision, ammunition, and a nume∣rous garrison, commanded by Gaucour, although he was at that time a prisoner of the English, released on parole to raise the money for his ransom; and the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tard of Orleans, with D'Orval, Lahire, Xaintrailles, Thouars, Boussac, Chabannes, La Fayette, Graville, and several other officers of distinction, had thrown themselves into the place, to signalize their courage and address.</P>

<P>In order to deprive the town entirely of all possibility of receiving succour, the earl of Salisbury ordered sixty small forts or redoubts to be built around it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of which six were more considerable than the rest, for commanding the principal avenues of the place; and these were supplied with great artillery, by which the walls were incessantly battered.

Charles, being destitute of troops and money, could not pretend to raise the siege; but notwithstanding all the vigilance of the English, he made shift to introduce succours from time to time; so that the garrison, which originally con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted of twelve hundred men, was, by the latter end of December, aug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ented to three thousand; and the number of the besiegers in∣creased to three and twenty thousand, by the reinforcements they received from the regent.

In this

Charles, receiving intelligence of the day on which he intended to begin his march, ordered the count de Clermont to attack him with three thousand men on the road to Orleans; and that nobleman executed his orders on the twelfth day of February at Rouvray St. Denis. Fastolfe, being apprized of his ap∣proach, drew up his men behind a barricade of waggons, where they sustained the first shock of the enemy, who attacked them with their usual impetuosity; but, far from breaking through the retrenchment, they met with such a warm reception as threw them into confusion; and the English commander seeing their disorder, caused openings to be made in his barricado, through which his men charged the enemy before they could rally, and routed them with great carnage. In this action, which was denominated the Battle of Herrings, one<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1429.</NOTE> hundred and twenty noblemen or officers of distinction lost their lives, besides a great number of common soldiers; but the Bastard of Orleans, who had joined Clermont on this occasion, retreated to the town with four hundred men<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monstrelet.

<P>Charles was so disheartened at this overthrow, that he began to look upon his affairs as desperate; but that he might not be wanting to his own interest, in neglecting any step that might contribute towards the preserva∣tion of Orleans, he sent Xaintrailles to the regent at Paris, to propose that the city might be deposited in the hands of the duke of Burgundy, until the war should be finished. This proposal being rejected by the duke of Bedford, the French king had actually determined to retire into Dauphiné, when his affairs were restored by a very surprizing revolution. About the latter end of Fe∣bruary, a country wench called Joan of Arc, native of the village of Danremy in Lorraine, addressed herself to Robert de Baudricourt governor of Vau-cou∣leurs; and affirmed that she had a commission from heaven to raise the siege of Orleans, and conduct Charles to Rheims, where he should be anointed and con∣secrated. Robert sent this damsel to the king at Chinon; and whether she was really a visionary, who thought herself actuated by divine inspiration, or only used as an instrument for the execution of a scheme which the court had con∣trived to revive the spirits of the French, broken by so many repeated defeats, certain it is she was received as something supernatural. She discovered the king, whom she had never seen before, in spite of a disguise he had assumed to deceive her; and the doctors of theology being ordered to examine her, de∣clared that her vocation was altogether miraculous. The parliament of Poi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iers, after the like enquiry, espoused the same opinion; and the king gave out that she had explained to him certain secrets, which she could not possibly know but by divine revelation. By these means every body was prepossessed in favour of the Maiden; and the people in general believed she was expresly sent
<PB N="312" REF="3220"/>
of God for the Talvation of the kingdom. Hitherto the scheme, as in all pro∣bability it was, succeeded to the wish of the projector. Joan of Arc was looked upon with adoration; and the French troops glowed with impatience to retrieve their honour, under the auspices of this female champion. She was certainly endowed with the courage and add<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of an amazon, and her natural intrepidity was flattered by the arts of superstition; so that she was wrought up to a degree of enthusiasm that overlooked every species of danger. She as∣sumed the habit and armour of a man, and was furnished with a sword from the tomb of a renowned knight, in the church of St. Catherine de Fierbois.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The French soldiery being thus animated, Charles sent a convoy towards Orleans, guarded by a strong body of troops, whom the Maiden had assured of success; and when they approached the gate of Burgundy, the Bastard made a sally to favour their entrance: a long and obstinate engagement ensued; and, the English being defeated, Joan entered Orleans at the head of the convoy, amidst the acclamations of the people, who were now fully satis∣fied of her divine mission. That this spirit might not be allowed to cool, she, on the fourth day of May, attacked the fort of St. Loup, which was one of those the English had raised for the blockade of the place; and, after a furious dispute of four hours, carried it sword in hand, against a garrison of twelve hundred men, four hundred of whom were killed in the assault. In two days after this action, she proceeded against the fort of St. John, where she met with very little resistance from the English, who had well nigh abandoned it before her approach. Having secured this conquest, she marched immedi∣ately against the fort of London, which was the most considerable of the whole number, and took it by strom, after a very obstinate engagement. Without giving her troops the least respite, she led them, that same evening, again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the fort of Tournelles, but, for want of day<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light, was obliged to post∣pone the attack till next morning, when she began the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ault, which conti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ued fourteen hours without intermission. The French were repulsed four times, and as often led back to the charge by Joan in person, notwithstand∣ing her being shot with an arrow between the neck and the shoulder; at length the fort was taken, and six hundred of the garrison cut in pieces.</P>

<DIV4 N="31" TYPE="section">

<P>Such a series of success, evidently owing to the valour of this vir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>go, who was extolled as an apostle from heaven, produced universal con∣sternation among the English. Though they did not believe the divinity of her mission, they conceived a notion rather more absurd, and supposed that she acted by compact with the devil. The loss of so many forts, and the dejection of the soldiers, rendering it impossible to carry on the operations of the siege, the earl of Suffolk abandoned the enterprize, after having lain seven months before the place, and retired in disorder, not without considerable loss from the besieged, who now pursued them, in their turn, though greatly inferior in number. Such a panic prevailed among the English, that they were afraid of facing those troops whom they had so often defeated, and so lately despised. The very generals seemed to be stupified with terror; for, instead of keeping their forces together in a body, until they should have recollected themselves from this infa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uation, they distributed great part of the army in places near the Loire, which they had reduced before they undertook the siege of Or∣leans, and retreated with the rest to a great distance: so that the enemy had
<PB N="313" REF="3230"/>
leisure to retake the towns and fortresses which they had thus garrisoned. The earl of Suffolk had imprudently thrown himself, with four hundred men only, into Gergeau, where he was made prisoner; and all the other places but Baugency, were again brought under the dominion of Charles, who now re∣solved to go and be consecrated at Rheims, though that city was still in the hands of the English. This expedition, however, he would not undertake until he should have made himself master of Baugency, which he immediately invested; and, while employed in this siege, he was joined by the constable de Richemont, who, hearing of his success, laid aside his resentment, and raised twelve hundred horse, and as many thousand infantry, in Bretagne, for his service.</P>

<P>The place being reduced, Charles, by the advice of his council, marched into Beauce against the remainder of the English troops, amounting to six thousand men, encamped near Patay, under the conduct of Talbot, who had succeeded to the command after the disaster of Suffolk. The French came upon them so suddenly, that they scarce had time to be formed. When they were charged, such was their pannic and confusion, that the greater part fled without making the least resistance; and Sir John Fastolfe himself was hurried away in the midst of the fugitives. The lords Talbot, Scales, and Hungerford, maintained the battle with great valour, until they were overpowered by num∣bers, and two thousand of their men lay dead on the field of battle; then they were obliged to yield to the fortune of the day, and were taken prisoners, to∣gether with Sir Thomas Rempston, and other officers of distinction. Jenville, a strong place in the neighbourhood of Patay, garrisoned with English troops, surrendered to the victors without resistance; and all the castles, that held for Henry, about Orleans, were abandoned by the defendants, who retired to∣wards Paris. The miscarriage before Orleans, and their defeat, were so fatal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trelet:</NOTE> to the English interest, that the duke of Bedford was obliged to confine him∣self within the walls of the capital; while the affairs of Charles assumed a most flourishing aspect. His brother-in-law Lewis III. duke of Anjou, and king of Sicily, joined him with a reinforcement of soldiers, and some excellent of∣ficers, whom he had lately brought back from Italy; so that, when he re∣viewed his army at Gien, it amounted to fifteen thousand fighting men, five of which he sent off in two detachments; one under the constable, to make a diversion in Normandy; and the other to carry the war into the heart of Guienne, under the conduct of the count de Perdriac. The king himself, at the head of the remaining ten thousand, began his march for Rheims; and in his route, received the submission of Troye and Chalons, while the inhabitants of Auxerre promised to follow the example of the principal towns of Cham∣pagne. Those of Rheims expelled the English garrison, and sent deputies with their keys to the king, who entered the city in triumph, and was consecrated with great solemnity. When the ceremony was performed, the Maid of Or∣leans desired permission to retire, alledging that she had now accomplished the end of her calling; but the king pressed her so earnestly to stay, that she at length complied with his request. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mez<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE></P>

<P>Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing this surprising revolution in the affairs of Charles, the court of Henry in England was again embroiled by a revival of the quarrel between the duke of Gloucester and the cardinal of England. This prel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te
<PB N="314" REF="3240"/>
was now become more insolent than ever, since his elevation; and the duke, in order to mortify his pride, would not allow him to officiate at the festival of St. George, patron of the order of the garter, tho' prelate of the order, in quality o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bishop of Winchester. The duke affirmed, that he could not per∣form the functions of cardinal and bishop, without the express permission of his majesty; and this being the opinion of the council, two noblemen were sent to give him notice, that he should desist from acting as bishop of Winchester. Next day, he appeared at council, and desired to know for what reason he was deprived of his right: but, the council gave him to understand, that his acting in such a double capacity would prejudice the prerogative of the crown; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> they per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ted in their resolution. This was a sensible mortification to the car∣dinal, as it afforded matter of triumph to his adversary; but he was soon con∣soled for the disgrace, by a bull from the pope, appointing him legate for Germany, and general of a crusade against the Bohemian heretics, who were distinguished by the appellation of Hussites. He no sooner received this com∣mission, than he sollicited the council for leave to raise five hundred lances, and as many thousand archers for that service; and his request being granted under certain restrictions, he began his levies with equal diligence and success. In the mean time the news of the battle of Patay arriving in England, the council immediately ordered new levies to be raised, under the command of Radcliffe; but, as these could not be assembled so soon as succours were required in France, they made a new convention with the cardinal, who engaged to serve with his troops in France, under the duke of Bedford, 'till the end of Decem∣ber, on condition that they should not be employed in any siege. In a few days after this contract, Garter king at arms arrived with letters from the re∣gent, pressing the council to send over a reinforcement with all possible dispatch, and desiring that the king might go over and be consecrated at Paris. Henry was now about eight years of age, and his council agreed to the expediency of his going thither; but at the same time resolved th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he should be first crowned king of England. This ceremony was accordingly performed on the sixth day of November; and then the parliament, which was assembled on the occasion, decreed that the dignity of protector should be suppressed, and the duke of Gloucester be thenceforward distinguished by the name of King's first<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</NOTE> counsellor.</P>

<P>While the English council was thus employed, the duke of Bedford repaired to Picardy, in order to make draughts from garrisons, and wait for the succours from England; while Soissons, Provins, Chateau-Thierry, Crepi, and some other places, submitted to Charles. The regent having received the reinforcement levied by the cardinal, marched towards Crepi, in order to give the French king battle; and, in a few days, the two armies came in sight of each other in a large plain, where Bedford, who had few horse, chose an advantageous situation, in hope of being attacked by the French impetuosity, to which he had owed his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uccess at Vernueil. But, for once he was disap∣pointed. Charles, grown wise by experience, forbore to attack him within his lines; but, after having tried in vain to provoke the English to forego the ad∣vantage of the situation, he decamped, in order to continue his conquests; and the regent, who followed him in hope of finding an opportunity to fight with a fair prospect of success, had the mortification to see him admitted into Senlis,
<PB N="315" REF="3250"/>
Beauvais, and seven or eight other places of importance from which the Eng∣lish garrrisons had been withdrawn. What augmented his chagrin was, the success of the constable de Richemont, who had been detached into Normandy, where having increased his forces to the number of eight thousand men, he reduced Evreux, and threatened to desolate the whole province. The duke dreading the loss of a country from whence he drew the greatest part of his subsistance, marched thither with the utmost expedition, and drove the consta∣ble out of that dutchy: but, in his absence, Charles made an attempt upon the city of Paris. He encamped on Montmartre, and published an amnesty in favour of the Parisians, who he hoped would have expelled the English forces, and submitted: but, the regent had taken such wise precautions, that his declaration produced no effect. Then he ordered the suburbs of St. Ho∣noré to be attacked; but the troops were repulsed with great loss, and the Maid of Orleans being wounded, was overtuned in the ditch, where she lay supposed to be dead, until she was brought off in the night, and found alive. After this unsuccessful assault, Charles retired to Bourges, where he passed the winter; and the regent returned to Paris, from which, during the severe season, he sent out detachments, which took St. Denys and Lagni by scalade. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>relet.</NOTE></P>

<P>The turn of affairs in France filled England with murmurs and discontent. Some accused the generals of having neglected their duty; and others affirmed, that this alteration was produced by the machination of the devil, who made use of Joan of Arc as the instrument of his malice: but, there was a third set, who imputed the bad success of the English to the mis∣conduct of the king's council; and in particular, to the ambition of the duke of Gloucester, who had undertaken a war in Hainault for his own private advantage, at a time when, if the whole strength of England had been united, the entire conquest of France might have been easily completed. There were not wanting a fourth species of politicians, who affirmed that the council had acted with imprudence in detaining so long the dukes of Orleans and Bour∣bon prisoners in England. They observed that the late king had derived great advantages from the divisions of the French princes; that therefore the prison∣ers ought to have been sent back to their own country, where, in all likelihood, they would have revived their antient quarrels; whereas, by their detention in England, France enjoyed a kind of tranquillity which enabled it to unite against the common enemy; that, if the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon had been in France, the duke of Burgundy would certainly have brought a greater number of troops into the field than he had hitherto <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnished; and that their ransome would serve at least to recruit the finances of England, which were almost exhausted. This last argument had such weight with the council, that nothing but the express desire of the late king could have prevented them from practising the expedient; at length they thought themselves at liberty to dis∣pense with that restriction in favour of the duke of Bourbon, who by a pri∣vate contract with Henry, had engaged to swear to the peace of Troye, to pay a certain sum by way of ransome, and to deliver two of his sons and for∣tresses, as hostages for the performance of his promise. Tho' Henry V. died<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> before this treaty could be executed, it had been renewed with some alteration; and young Henry had, as king of France, received the duke's homage. The treaty was ratified; but, some intervening obstacles prevented the duke's re∣lease;
<PB N="316" REF="3260"/>
and, after a captivity of eighteen years, he died at last a prisoner in<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. 1430.</NOTE> England. The council was the more disposed to this accommodation, as it would have afforded a fund to defray the expence of the king's voyage to France; but this resource failing, they practised another shift that answered the purpose. All persons possessing forty pounds a year in land were sum∣moned to receive the honour of knighthood; the jewels of the crown were pawned, and sums of money borrowed from towns, corporations, and indivi∣duals: the cardinal, by whom he was attended, advanced above nine thousand pounds upon the occasion. By means of this supply, the king was attended in his voyage by a considerable body of forces; but the English in general were so possessed with dreadful notions of Joan's enchantments, that many o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icers and soldiers deserted before their embarkation; and a great number of those who crossed the sea, being intimidated by the accounts they heard of her exploits, withdrew privately from their colours, and returned to England.</P>

<P>Henry arrived about the latter end of April at Calais, from whence he repaired to Rouen, where he passed the summer, while the regent was employed in making preparations for the ceremony of his consecration at Paris, which was performed on the seventeenth day of December. During the king's residence at Rouen, the duke of Bedford, suspecting that the duke of Burgundy began to listen to the sollicitations of those agents who were in∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>santly employed by Charles to detach him from the interest of England, thought p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oper to engage him more strongly in the alliance, at the expence of all the places the English possessed in Champagne and Brie, which he ceded to that prince, in order to strengthen the connexion. What likewise contri∣buted to retain him the longer in his English engagements, was his third mar∣riage with Isabel of Portugal, who was nearly related to Henry. These mo∣tives induced the duke to supply the regent with a reinforcement, which en∣abled him to take the field, and reduce some places in the Isle of France, by which the Parisians had been very much incommoded.</P>

<P>Burgundy in person entered France at the head of a powerful army, with which he reduced Torsy and Soissons, and then undertook the fiege of Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egne, defended by Flavy, with a numerous garrison, well provided with stores and ammunition. At the first report of this enterprize, the Maid of Orleans and Xaintrailles, threw themselves into the place, to the no small mortification of the governor, who could not bear the thought of losing any part of the glory that might be acquired in the defence. On the twenty-fifth day of May Joan made a sally, and fought with her usual intrepidity; but being obliged to retire, placed herself in the rear, to amuse the enemy until her troops should make good their retreat. Having performed this service e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ctually, she attempted to follow them into the city, and found the gates shut and the bridge drawn up, by order of the governor, who is said to have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hut her out knowingly, that she might fall into the hands of the besiegers. Finding it impossible to escape, she surrendered to the Bastard of Vendome, who de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivered her immediately to the count de Ligny, the Burgundian gene∣ral. The regent was no sooner informed of her being taken, than he pur∣chased her of the count for a very valuable consideration. When the place was reduced to extremity, it was succoured by the count de Vendome, with a co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siderable reinforcement of troops, provision, and ammunition; so that the

<P>Joan of Arc had introduced such a spirit of superstition, both among French and English, that the best officers of both armies were misled by the most blind credulity. It appears from the regent's letter to the king, after the siege of Orleans was raised, that he believed the Maid to be an inchantress inspired by the devil; and an incident that happened at this juncture plainly proves that the French generals imagined the cause of Charles was espoused by a particular providence. A shepherd in the neighbourhood of Rouen, ad∣dressing himself to the marechal de Boussac, assured him, that by virtue of a revelation from heaven, he could conduct him through a secret path into the very heart of Rouen; and the marechal communicating the proposal to Xain∣trailles, they agreed to embrace the opportunity which was offered by provi∣dence. Having therefore assembled a body of chosen troops, they followed the shepherd, who conducted them into an ambuscade formed by Talbot, who destroyed the greater part of their forces, and took Xaintrailles prisoner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monstrelet.</NOTE></P>

<P>Mean while the duke of Gloucester, in England, taking the ad∣vantage of the cardinal's absence, declared in the council that Winchester in∣tended to quit the king, whom he had accompanied to France, and return to England to excite fresh troubles in this kingdom, as well as to avail himself of the pope's authority for dissolving his engagement to serve against the French king. This remonstrance met with such credit, that the council published a proclamation, forbidding all his majesty's subjects, of what rank and condition soever they might be, on pain of imprisonment, to accompany the cardinal, should he leave the king without the royal permission. On<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the back of this transaction a truce for one year was concluded with the king of Castile; and another for five years with Scotland, signed at Edinburgh by the English ambassadors.</P>
<P N="40">XL. The maid of Orleans having remained in custody since the siege of Compiegne, the king, by the advice of his council of France, sent her to Rouen to be tried for witchcraft; and, after a long examination, the ecclesi∣astical judges condemned her, as an heretic, to do pennance all the rest of her life on bread and water. Some time after this sentence was pronounced, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1431.</NOTE> same judges, on pretence of her having relapsed into her former errors, delivered her over to the secular arm to be burned alive; and this sentence was executed upon her in the old market-place of Rouen on the thirtieth day of May. She appeared upon her trial to be a weak enthusiast; and in all probability her life would have been saved, had not the regent thought it absolutely necessary to convince the soldiers, by her death and public execution, of the falsity of the reports which had represented her as a messenger from God, and an agent of the devil; reports which they could no longer believe, after having seen how unable she was to elude the penalties of justice. Whatever were his mo∣tives, his conduct cannot be justly extolled, for having sacrificed to his policy, revenge, or superstition, a poor illiterate maiden, who was intitled to the re∣gard of every generous mind, for the surprising efforts she made in behalf of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. de Charl.

<P>The fate of Joan was very prejudicial to the affairs of Charles, for the reasons we have already mentioned; and that prince was in such distress
<PB N="318" REF="3280"/>
for want of money, that he could not maintain an army in the field. Henry was nearly in the same situation; for his French subjects were exhausted, as well as generally disaffected to his government; and the people of England were by this time heartily tired of a ruinous war, which afforded no prospect of a termination. This being the case on both sides, the war was maintained in petty incursions, and little stratagems for the surprisal of towns and fortresses. The French made themselves masters of Chartres by means of a waggon loaded with wine, which was overturned under the portcullis. The English on the other hand surprized Montargis, by carrying on a correspondence with a damsel of the town, who prevailed upon her lover, a barber, to give them admittance. Charles was concerned in another dispute, besides that which subsisted between him and Henry. René, second son of Lewis II. king of Sicily, and duke of Anjou, having succeeded to the dutchy of Bar, by the death of his uncle the cardinal de Bar, and marquis of Pont-a-Mousson, wanted to establish himself also in possession of Lorraine, on the demise of the duke his father-in-law. But the succession was disputed with him by Anthony, count de Vaudemont, son of Frederic the younger brother of duke Charles. This contest produced a war, in which the French king supported the party of René, who was his brother-in-law, while that of his competitor was espoused by the duke of Burgundy. On the second day of July, the two princes meet∣ing at Bulegneville, a bloody battle ensued, in which René was vanquished, taken, and conducted to Dijon; and twelve hundred French troops being<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de Lor∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne.</NOTE> killed in this engagement, Charles was disabled from attempting any thing of consequence against the English.</P>

<P>While Henry resided in France, pope Eugenius II. sent thither the cardinal of Santa Cruz to persuade the two kings to an accommodation; and that legate prevailed upon them to send ambassadors to Auxerre, where, how∣ever, the conferences were not opened, because the English would not own the plenipotentiaries of Charles for the ambassadors of France. Notwith∣standing this miscarriage, the cardinal continued his good offices, and another day was appointed for their meeting again in the succeeding year; but they could not agree upon the place, and the negotiation miscarried. Henry quit∣ting Paris immediately after Christmas, retired to Rouen as a place of greater safety; though it was very near being surprized by the treachery of one Peter Audebeauf, a native of Bearne, retained in the English service, who introduced an hundred and twenty men, commanded by one Recarville, into the great tower of the castle. To support these, a larger body of troops had advanced within a league of the place; but the officers quarrelling among themselves about the manner of sharing the booty which they hoped to obtain, confusion ensued, and the whole number returned to Beauvais. Those who had been admitted into the tower were obliged to surrender at discretion; and Henry's governors, alarmed at this attempt, conveyed him immediately to his English dominions, where the animosity between the duke of Gloucester and the car∣dinal still glowed with unabating rancour.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1432.</NOTE> In the parliament of the preceding year, the bishop found means to engage the house of commons in his interest, so as to obtain a triumph over his adversary, who had endeavoured to do him ill offices in his absence. They had presented an address to his majesty, desiring, that in con∣sideration
<PB N="319" REF="3290"/>
of the great services the cardinal had done the state, he would grant an amnesty in his favour, for every thing he might have transacted contrary to the laws, particularly to the statutes of premunire. Notwithstanding this address, with which his majesty complied, the duke of Gloucester would not relinquish the pursuit. He pretended that he had proofs in his hands sufficient to convict the cardinal of high treason; a crime which could not be implied in the pardon he had received. Winchester, who was at that time in Flanders transacting the king's affairs, returned to London, without having demanded permission, and the duke made this a pretext for seizing his baggage. Next day the cardinal went to the house of lords, where he declared he was come to justify his conduct, and prove his innocence against any person who should charge him with delinquency. As Gloucester did not think proper to main∣tain what he had advanced, he was acknowledged as a faithful subject, by an authentic act passed at his earnest desire. Then he complained that his bag∣gage had been seized at Sandwich, and demanded restitution. He offered to deposit six thousand pounds in the king's hands for six years; and if in that time the baggage should appear to have been lawfully seized, the money should be confiscated for the use of his majesty. He likewise offered to lend him as much more, and postpone the demand of thirteen thousand marks al∣ready due to him, on condition that the payment of the whole should be as∣signed to him on the first subsidy that should be granted. His proposals were accepted, and his effects restored; and the duke of Gloucester, far from being able to injure his character, saw him triumph over his resentment in the ap∣plause of both houses of parliament.</P>

<P>England was more attentive to the contest between these two am∣bitious rivals, than to the war of France, which they seemed almost to have forgot; though the present juncture afforded them a fair opportunity to repair the losses they had sustained, and retrieve the credit of their arms. Charles gave himself up to the delights of indolence, in the embraces of Agnes Sorel, and left the care of his most important affairs to his ministers and generals. His favourite La Tremouille was accused of encouraging him in this habit of idleness and indifference; but this was not the case. Charles began to be dis∣gusted with this minister, and grow uneasy under the yoke he had imposed. The constable being informed, by his emissaries at court, of this alienation, re∣solved to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act the tragedy of Louvet, De Giac, and Beaulieu, and having secured the interest of the courtiers who hated the minister, he caused him to be apprehended in his bed, at Chinon, within the king's palace, and conveyed to prison at Montresor. Charles was equally surprized and incensed at this outrage, which he swore he would revenge upon the constable: but, when he heard all the princes of the blood, and all the nobles of his court, declare against La Tremouille, he che<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked his indignation. He remembered with fear the league which had been formed against him in the case of Louvet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the disgust he had begun to conceive for the minister, enabled him to give him up with the less reluctance.

But for some time these had been intirely interrupted; so that he could not keep the field without unfurnishing the places of their garrisons, and leaving them at liberty to declare for Charles.

<P>These were events of little consequence, in comparison with that which happened on the thirteenth day of November. This was the death of Anne of Burgundy dutchess of Bedford, which not only affected her hus∣band in particular, but also the whole English nation, as it entirely broke that bond of connexion which had united the dukes of Bedford and Burgundy; and the mutual resentment which succeeded their union was fatal to the interest of England. In the beginning of the year, there was a dangerous insurrection of the peasants in Normandy, who, taking arms to the number of sixty thousand, two thirds of these proceeded to the Vexin; and the other body of twenty thou∣sand marched to C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, which they took, together with Harfleur, Dieppe, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1433.</NOTE> Lillebonne. The earl of Arundel was no sooner apprized of the insurrection, than he marched against those who were assembled at the Vexin, and charging them in the night, obtained an easy victory. Those in Caen might have been more troublesome, as they were headed by the marechal de Rieux; but they were so intimidated by the defeat of their companions, that the greatest part of them dispersed to their own habitations. The marechal, with some of the most courageous, threw himself into Dieppe, which, together with Harfleur, re∣mained in possession of the French king, though Arundel reduced Caen and Lillebonne. In the course of this year, the duke of Bedford married Jaqueline of Lux<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bourg, daughter of James count of St. Pol; a match that gave great umbrage to the duke of Burgundy, who not only looked upon it as an in∣sult to the memory of his sister so lately deceased, but also resented the regent's marrying the daughter of his vassal, without his consent or knowledge. The cardinal of England endeavoured to repair this breach, and mediate a reconci∣liation. He succeeded so far as to obtain their mutual consent to an interview at St. Omer, where all differences might be amicably adjusted; but when they rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red to this place, a fresh dispute ensued about rank and precedence. Neither would yield in point of punctilio; and they parted, more than ever incensed against each other. In all probability the duke of Burgundy had already de∣termined to abandon the English interest, and used this trivial dispute as a pre∣tence for breaking with the regent: though he resolved to have it in his power to make his own terms with Charles, and for that purpose persisted in

<P>By this time the council of England were become more desirous of peace, than of engaging in any new measures for retrieving what the king had lost in France. The duke of Orleans, who still continued a prisoner at London, had offered to employ all his influence in forwarding a treaty, on which all his hope of liberty depended. He proposed that the queen dowager of Sicily, her son Charles of Anjou, the duke of Brittany, with his brothers the counts of Richemont and of St. Gilles, the duke of Alen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, the counts of Armagnac, Foix, Perdriac, Clermont, and the archbishop of Paris, should meet the plenipotentiaries of England at Calais, or any other place pitched upon by the English council; and he desired permission to assist at the congress, in order to enforce the negotiation. At the same time he presented a set of articles, which were so favourable for England, that the council embraced his proposal without hesitation; and he signed, sealed, and swore to the perfor∣mance of the treaty which he had planned. Passports were expedited for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> queen dowager of Sicily, and the other persons named in his proposal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the month of October was fixed for the time of the conferences; and the council appointed commissioners to treat with the plenipotentiaries of Charles. The duke of Orleans acted on this occasion in concert with the court of France, whose aim was to dupe the council of England. The articles of a separate peace between Charles and the duke of Burgundy were already adjusted, by the means of the constable of Richemont, who had conferred with the duke at Nevers, on pretence of accommodating a difference between that prince and the count de Clermont; and nothing was wanting but an opportunity to finish and confirm the treaty. For this purpose they projected the plan of a congress for a general peace, well knowing that the English would reject the conditions that would be proposed; and their refusal would furnish the duke with a pre∣text for concluding a separate accommodation. This was the true motive of the magnificent offers made by the duke of Orleans to the king of England, in case the conferences should prove ineffectual. They knew nothing was so<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1434<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> likely to engage Henry's council in the negotiation, as the hope of its producing something advantageous to England, even though it should not succeed; and the duke of Bedford, as well as the council, being utterly ignorant of what had passed between the duke of Burgundy and Charles, were the more easily caught in the snare. As soon as they had consented to the congress, the duke of Bur∣gundy, who still maintained the appearance of union with the English, ma∣naged matters in such a manner, that instead of Calais they fixed upon Arras for the place of congress, to which all the parties concerned agreed to send their ambassadors.</P>

The French having surprized Rue in Picardy, the earl of Arundel resolved to retake the place; but understanding on his march that the enemy had fortified Herberoi near Beauvais, he judged it expedient to drive them thence before the works could be brought to perfection, and sat down before the town. Receiving intelligence that Vignol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Xaintrailles

Charles sent thither seventeen plenipotentiaries, at the head of whom was the constable de Richemont; and Henry appointed twenty-seven for France and England, the duke of Burgundy being the principal. Hitherto the regent and the English council were persuaded that the duke acted upon good faith: but they soon received intelligence that he had sollicited the pope to absolve him from the oath which he had taken to the late king Henry. Eugenius being questioned on this subject, declared that no French prince had ever made any such demand; and that for the future he would observe such conduct as would be satisfactory to the king of England. The conferences began on the sixth day of August, with the proposals of Charles, whose ambassadors offered to Henry all Normandy and Guienne, on condition that he would renounce his pretensions to the crown of France, and do homage for those two provinces. The English plenipotentiaries, equally surprized and incensed at a proposal so widely different from the articles agreed upon with the duke of Orleans, broke off the conference abruptly, and retired without deigning to make the least reply.</P>

<P>The duke of Burgundy made their sudden departure a pretext for con∣cluding a separate peace. He observed that he was not obliged to follow their caprice, and gratify their pride at the expence of his own interest. The pope's legate absolved him of all the oaths he had taken to Henry V. and his successor; and his treaty with Charles was soon ratified, as all the articles had been adjusted before hand. Charles obliged himself by this treaty to ask par∣don of Philip, either in person or by his delegates, for the murder of his father, as a crime which had been perpetrated in his youth, at the instigation of evil counsellors; to deliver up all the assassins to justice; to found chapels and masses for the souls of John duke of Burgundy, and his attendants who were killed by his side; to make good all damages sustained by such as were taken on the day of the murder; to erect a cross on the place where it was committed, and pay fifty thousand crowns in gold, in lieu of the duke's jewels, which were seized, at his assassination. He agreed to cede to Philip and his heirs the cities and counties of Boulogne-sur-Mer, Macon, St. Jangout, and Auxerre, with all their dependencies, together with all the taxes called aids, imposed on those parts of Macon, Chalons, Autun, and Langres, that lay with∣in Burgundy; the castles, towns, and districts of Bar-sur-Seine, Peronne,

Philip himself was exempted from doing homage for these territories during the life of Charles, as were his vassals from obeying the summons of Charles, without his order. The French king promised to succour him in case he should be attacked by the English; and both parties declared they would make no agreement with the enemy, without the consent of each other. The duke's vassals, and others, who had borne St. Andrew's cross, which was the ensign of Burgundy, were exempted from serving under any other; and a general pardon was granted to all persons except the assassins a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orementioned.

Isabel, queen dowager of France, seeing the success of her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Charles, whom she always hated, and the desperate condition of the Eng∣lish interest, died at Paris of vexation, very little regretted by the French, who looked upon her as the principal cause of the ruin of the kingdom. Her death was of very little consequence to either party; but this was not the case with that of the regent, who died in the castle of Rouen on the fourteenth day of September, universally lamented by the English, not only as the sole support of their interest in France, but also as a prince of the most amiable disposition. He certainly possessed all the heroism of his brother Henry, without his defects; and, by his admirable conduct, maintained the war in France almost without any assistance from England. Had he been properly supported, he would in all probability have completed the conquest of that kingdom, which, though na∣turally an enemy to his success, universally owned and applauded his valour, justice, and moderation. The death of this worthy prince was no sooner known in England, than Richard Plantagenet duke of York was appointed regent of France: but Henry duke of Somerset, who had been his competitor for that dignity, managed his intrigues in the council with such art, that his patent was not expedited for seven months, during which the partisans of Charles extended their conquests without opposition.</P>

<P>The duke of York, having at length received his commission of regent, landed in Normandy with a good body of troops from England, and retook many small places or castles, which the French had reduced since the death of the duke of Bedford. While he was employed in the conquest of Nor∣mandy, he received intelligence that the duke of Burgundy had made great pre∣parations for a siege<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and suspecting that his design was to invest Calais, he imparted his conjectures to the council, pressing them to put that place in a proper posture of defence. Before they could take any measures for this pur∣pose, the duke invested the town with an army of fifty thousand men; and this circumstance being known in England, increased the animosity of the nation to a most virulent degree against that prince, whom they reviled as the worst of all apostates. Orders were issued to levy fifteen thousand troops for the relief of the place; and the command of these was given to the duke of Gloucester, while at the same time this nobleman and the lord Beaumont were gratified by Henry with grants of all the territories belonging to the house of Bur∣gundy in France and Flanders. These forces being levied, the duke of Glou∣cester set sail, and landed with them in Normandy about six weeks after the duke of Burgundy had begun the siege. He had not as yet made much pro∣gress in his operations; but on the contrary sustained some checks, which not a little disheartened his Flemish forces. Several vigorous and successful fallies had been made by the garrison. Part of the duke's fleet which blocked up

the place by sea, having been left a-ground at low-water, the inhabitants of Calais found means to set the ships on fire and destroy them entirely; a wooden fort erected by the besiegers, and well supplied with cannon, was taken by the English, and all the Flemings <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in it were put to the sword; and lastly, the duke of Gloucester, before he embarked, sent an herald to challenge Bur∣gundy to battle. All these circumstances concurred to intimidate the troops of Flanders, consisting chiefly of raw undisciplined militia; and when they under∣stood that the duke of Gloucester was on his march towards Calais, their whole camp was filled with mutiny and confusion. They struck their tents of their own accord; and, in spite of all the duke's remonstrances and authority, began to retreat in the utmost disorder.

The truce between England and Scotland had expired, and hostilities were recommenced between the two nations.

Henry's council had employed all their influence to prevent the match between Margaret and the dauphin, in the way of negotiation; but finding James determined in favour of his French alliance, they fitted out a fleet to intercept the princess in her passage to France; though the Scottish king eluded their vigilance by sending her with a convoy of forty ships around the western isles, and she landed in sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety at Rochelle. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE></P>

This match, so unequal to her rank, and the dignity of her first marriage, gave great disgust to the English nation, and in particular to the duke of Gloucester, who thinking the honour of his family degraded by such an al∣liance, committed Owen to Newgate, from whence he escaped, and was after∣wards slain fighting for the house of Lancaster.

<P>Since the arrival of the duke of York in France, the affairs of the English assumed a more favourable aspect in that country. Charles had no confiderable army in the field; nor could he expect much assistance from the duke of Burgundy, who had occasion for all his forces to quell the revolt of his own subjects. The beginning of the year was so excessively cold, that the generals of both sides co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld not undertake any regular operation in the field. Nevertheless, the indefatigable Talbot found means to turn this un∣common rigour of the season to the advantage of his country. He assembled a body of forces<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and dressing some of them in white apparel, they crept into the dir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oise, without being perceived by the garrison, who could not distinguish them from the snow with which the ground was covered. Mean while the rest of the detachment approached the place in the dark, in order to sustain their companions, who applying their scaling-ladders, at the time when the g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrison relieved the watch at day-break, made their way into the town, and opened the gates for Talbot, who entered the place on one side, while the French fled at the other. The surprize of this important town was a severe blow to Charles; and greatly incommoded the Parisians, who saw the English garrison make daily incursions to the suburbs of their capital. The duke of Burgundy, alarmed at the success of the English, which if not seasonably checked might produce a revolution that would prove fatal to his interest,
<PB N="327" REF="3370"/>
resolved to rouse Charles from that lethargy of sloth and indolence which he had hitherto indulged; and gave him to understand, that if he would consult his own glory and advantage, so far as to a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>semble all his troops, and march at their head towards Paris, in order to drive the English from the heart of the kingdom, he, the duke, would contribute towards his success by making a powerful diversion in Picardy. This remonstrance seemed to wake him from his slumber. He forthwith assembled his forces; and, in his route to Paris, attacked Montereau-faut-Yonne, while the duke of Burgundy under∣took the siege of Crotoy, a strong place in Picardy. It was invested by a numerous land-army, while the harbour was blocked up by four large French vessels. The duke of York being at that time recalled to England, through the intrigues of Somerset, detached Talbot to the relief of the besieged, with a body of five thousand men; and that intrepid chief undertook the task, tho' the Burgundian army amounted to five times the number, and he was obliged to pass the river Somme in the face of the enemy. The duke being informed of his approach, left part of his troops to continue the siege, and with the remainder took post on the side of the river, to dispute the passage of the English, who hated him to such a degree, that no danger could deter them from gratifying their revenge. Talbot profiting by this disposition, was the first man who rushed into the stream, and they followed him with such alacrity as intimidated the Burgundians on the other side, who believing they were devils rather than men, betook themselves to flight with the utmost precipitation; and their pannic infecting those who continued in the lines be∣fore the town, the whole army disper<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, in spite of all the efforts of their commander.

<P>Mean while Charles carried on the siege of Montereau, which was bravely defended by Thomas Gerard, though he had not above four hundred men under his command. Hitherto Charles had not greatly distin∣guished himself by his personal courage; but on this occasion he signalized his valour in a very remarkable manner. He not only exposed himself in the trenches, like the meanest soldier in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> army; but when, after a long siege the place was carried by assault, he was one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst who entered the breach sword in hand, and fought singly with surprising prowess. The intrepidity of his behaviour in this assault produced a very favourable effect in behalf of his character: and yet he seemed to have exhausted all his vivacity in this effort; for Gerard retiring to the castle, the king relapsed into his former indolence, and left the care and conduct of this second siege to his son the dauphin. The English commander, after having sustained a series of assaults for fifteen days in this fortress, was at length obliged to capitulate. When he appeared in the presence of Lewis, he told him, that against any other besieger he should have made a longer defence; a compliment, which though it agreeably flat∣tered the vanity of that young prince, was extremely mortifying to his father, who, from that day, conceived a jealousy against his son, which was of pernicious consequence. Charles, from Montereau marched to Paris, which he entered in triumph, amidst the acclammations of the people; and certainly those ex∣pressions of joy were perfectly sincere, as they now saw their native king re∣stored

to his capital, after it had remained so long in the power of a tri∣umphant enemy; and found him disposed to forget all the unkindness he had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uffered at their hands. He forthwith re-established the parliament and the courts of judicature, and confirmed all the privileges of the city: but this happy calm was of short duration. The resort of multitudes who followed the court to Paris, not only produced a dearth, but likewise introduced a dreadful infection, which reged to such a degree, that the king and royal fa∣mily were obliged in a few days to abandon the city, which in a little time be∣came<NOTE PLACE="marg">P Daniel.

<P>This tedious war had exhausted England in such a manner, that the council was always ready to listen to all proposals of accommodation; and, as the duke of Orleans saw no other prospect of obtaining his liberty, he be∣came very sincere in his endeavours to promote a pacification. For this pur∣pose, he demanded permission to go to Calais, and confer with the duke of Brittany, whom he looked upon as the most proper person to act the part of mediator. The council would have readily complied with this request, had they believed Charles was disposed to an equitable peace; but, until they should be better informed of his inclinations, they did not think proper to make any advances, especially as the duke of Gloucester violently opposed the projected negotiation, on pretence that they could not expect an advantageous peace at such a conjuncture; though his real aim was to thwart the cardinal, who had countenanced the proposal of the duke of Orleans. Not but that this prelate began to gain ground upon his antagonist, in proportion as the king advanced in years. His wealth enabled him to accommodate Henry with supplies of money, at a time when assistance of that kind was counted the most essential service that could be done to the state; and the young prince, who was naturally superstitious, had been trained up in the most abject veneration of the clergy. The cardinal did not fail to make use of these ad∣vantages, and prepossessed the king's mind so much in his favour, that he granted him a general pardon for all crimes he might have committed, of what nature soever they might be, from the creation of the world down to the twenty-eighth of June in the current year; so that his adversary was to∣tally<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> disabled <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom prosecuting his revenge.</P>

<P>About this period, James king of Scotland, a prince of truly royal virtues, fell a sacrifice to the ambition of his own uncle Walter earl of Athol, who, with the assistance of a bold outlaw called Graeme, broke into the con∣vent of Dominicans at Perth, where the king was lodged, and assassinated him in the night. A young lady of the name of Douglas, who attended the queen, being alarmed with the noise, ran to secure the door of the apartment, and perceiving that the bolt was purposely removed, by some of the domestics who were concerned in the conspiracy, she supplied the want of it with her own arm, which was crushed by the assassins. James, though naked, seized his sword, and bravely defended himself against a great number of foes, some of whom he killed upon the spot, till at length he was overpowered, and fell pierced with eight and twenty wounds, several of which were mortal. Nor should the spirit and affection of his English queen pass unheeded: she interposed between her husband and the swords of the assassins, and received
<PB N="329" REF="3390"/>
some dangerous wounds in his defence. The tragical fate of James was at∣tended<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> with an advantage to the king of England, who was not only freed from a dangerous neighbour, attached to his enemy of France, but saw him succeeded by an infant, during whose minority the governor of Scotland was influenced by the queen-mother, Henry's kinswoman, and she soon ef∣fected a truce for nine years between the two nations. England, as well as France, being afflicted with the pestilence, the war languished for want of re∣inforcements; and nothing was undertaken on either side of greater importance than some petty siege, or pillaging excursion. The duke of Burgundy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in∣deed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

No other event worth mentioning occurred in the course of this year, except the exchange of the count d'Eu, who had been taken in the battle of Agincourt, for John Beaufort, brother to Henry duke of Somerset, whom he succeeded in that title, though he too died without male issue, and the dukedom devolved upon his fourth brother Edmund, of whom we shall have occasion to say many things in the sequel.</P>

<P>In the month of March, the constable Richemont assembling a considerable body of troops, invested the city of Meaux, one of the strongest places in France, which had formerly held out seven months against Henry V. It was now defended by the Bastard of Han, an officer of distinguished valour; but, notwithstanding all his vigilance and conduct, the town was, after a siege of three weeks, taken by assault, and the governor made prisoner in the action. The garrison retired into the part called the Market, which is on the other side of the Maine, and broke down the bridge of communication; so that the constable was obliged to begin a new siege more di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficult than the former. In the mean time, he ordered the governor to be beheaded, because, though a native of France, he served in the army of England. Then he surrounded his camp with lines of contravallation, strengthened by redoubts, to prevent all succour from being thrown into the place; and the king repaired to the siege, that his presence might animate the soldiers to redouble their endeavours. Talbot, notwithstanding all these precautions, resolved to succour the be∣sieged. He marched at the head of a small body of chosen men towards the French lines, and taking by storm one of the redoubts that obstructed his passage, entered the place with a convoy. Next day he retired in the same manner, before the enemy had recovered of their consternation, determined to throw in another more considerable supply: but, before this could be pre∣pared, the constable, en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aged at the affront he had sustained from such an handful of English, pressed the garrison with such impetuosity and perseve∣rance, as obliged them to capitulate. The success of this enterprize encou∣raged him to undertake the siege of Avranche, which he had carried on for three weeks, when Talbo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with the troops prepared for the relief of Meaux, forced his lines and revictualled the place. After this exploit he took the route<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1439.</NOTE> to Harfleur; and, as he had not a sufficient number of forces to undertake
<PB N="330" REF="3400"/>
the siege in form, he resolved to reduce the town by blockade. For this purpose he entrenched himself so advantageously, that he might have set an army of fifty thousand men at defiance; while the place was blocked up by sea with a fleet of ships commanded by the duke of Somerset. The count d'Eu, lately arrived from England, advanced with a body of troops to attack the English entrenchments; but, perceiving the nature of their situation, he thought proper to retire, after having made a slight attempt, in which Gaucour fell into the hands of Talbot. The blockade lasted four months, at the end of which Talbot reduced the town; then he proceeded to clear the rest of Normandy of the French garrisons that po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sessed several castles, until the whole province was conquered except the town of Dieppe.</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the generals amused themselves in taking and retak∣ing towns, the sensible part of both nations saw with regret the war protracted, without any prospect of a conclusion. The pope directed the cardinal de S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Croce to exhort the two kings in his name to put an end to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of christian blood, which had been shed so profusely in the cause of their quarrel; and at the same time, his holiness wrote to the duke of Brit∣tany, intreating him to undertake the office of mediator. That prince having communicated the pope's letter to both kings, found them equally disposed to begin a new negotiation; and the duke of Burgundy was overjoyed at the pro∣posed, because, while the war continued, he ran some ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>que from the resentment of the English, and could expect no assistance from Charles towards the re∣duction of his rebellious subjects in Flanders. The duke of Orleans seized this opportunity of offering his mediation in conjunction with that of the duke of Brittany; and renewed his sollicitations for leave to confer with that prince at Calais. This was granted, notwithstanding the opposition of the duke of Gloucester, who foresaw that Orleans would not act the part of an impartial mediator. But the cardinal had by this time superseded all the duke's interest in council; and the members were so defirous of peace, that they seemed to have forgot the vain hopes with which they had been amused by Orleans, when he persuaded them to send ambassadors to the congress at Arras. The two courts therefore appointed commissioners to adjust the preparatory conventions for the congress; and these meeting, agreed, that a truce was absolutely necessary towards the success of the negotiation. Henry invested his agents with power to ratify such a cessation, which however did not take place. In the month of January, Isabel of Portugal, dutchess of Burgundy, and the cardinal of Win∣chester, conferred together between Calais and Gravelines, where they agreed, that the conferences should be opened between the two crowns, under the medi∣ation of the dukes of Brittany and Orleans; and the plenipotentiaries on each side were chosen from the principal noblemen of both kingdoms. Those of England were furnished with instructions which plainly demonstrated the sin∣cerity of Henry's council; and if the envoys had not been too scrupulous in concealing the extent of their respective powers, in all probability, the nego∣tiation would have succeeded. But, they were so cautious of betraying any part of their instructions that might give their opponents an advantage over them, that the conferences broke up before they had an opportunity of coming to a right understanding. The English did not think proper to advance be∣yond the second article of their instructions, which directed them to propose, that Charles should possess the provinces on the other side of the Loire, on condition of doing homage to Henry; and the French limited their conces∣sions to the proposal made in the conference at Arras, importing that their master, as sole king of France, should cede Guienne and Normandy to Henry, as dependent f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efs of the French king, for which the English monarch should do homage. They mentioned this as an instance of great condescension in Charles, who had not risen in his demands since the congress at Arras, although he had lately extended his conquests, and even made himself master of the ca∣pital.

<P>The dukes of Burgundy and Orleans were the only persons who reaped any advantage from this con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. The first was determined to do something for the relief of his subjects in Flanders, Brabant, Holland, and Zealand, who had su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ered grievously from the interruption of their trade with England. He therefore, employed the good offices of his dut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hess, who being nearly related to king Henry, held several conferences with the cardinal of Winchester, on pre∣tence of mediating an accommodation between the two crowns; and negotiated a commercial truce between England and the Low Countries. But, the duke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> of Orleans was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till a greater gainer by the conference; in consequence of which, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e obtained his liberty after a captivity that la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted five and twenty years. We have already observed, that the cardinal had gained the ascendancy over the spirit of the king, who being a w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ak, timorous prince, was easily persuaded that the duke of Gloucester intended to keep him in perpetual servitude; and that his ambition was prejudicial to the interest of the kingdom. Henry's passions had been so artfully prepoffessed against his uncle, that he conceived an aversion to his character, and constantly declared against every proposal which the duke made in council. This nobleman had always opposed the release of the duke of Orleans; not only in deference to the dying request of his brother; but also, because he was persuaded that in releasing the duke of Orleans, they should a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gment the enemies of England. Gloucester's opposition was of advantage to his proposal of assisting at the congress. His mediation was accepted, and when the conferences opened, he seemed extremely zealous for an accommo∣dation. By means of the dutchess of Burgundy he was reconciled to the duke her husband; and the cardinal, at his return to England, represented hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> con∣duct in the most advantageous light to the council, observing, that since he had exerted his utmost endeavours for the benefit of the nation, he ought not to be a loser by the miscarriage of the treaty. His friends took this opportunity of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1440.</NOTE> advancing the two arguments which have been already mentioned in his behalf; namely, that the division between him and the duke of Burgundy might revive, and be productive of advantage to England; and that his ransome would help to maintain the war. They proposed, however, that before his release he should take an oath to the king, and swear that he would in no shape support the in∣terest of Charles.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Gloucester perceiving that the council was determined to treat with Orleans about his enlargement, entered a formal protest to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol∣lowing purpose: That, considering the weakness of Charles and his son the dauphin, together with the capacity, insinuation, and influence of the duke of Orleans, there was the greatest reason to believe the states of France would con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er upon him the administration of affairs; an event, than which nothing could be more prejudicial to England, as that prince was so well acquainted with the we<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k parts of this government and kingdom: That, in all probability, the duke of Orleans would mediate a reconciliation between Charles and the dau∣phin;
<PB N="334" REF="3440"/>
so that England would lose all the advantages she might otherwise derive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom that dissension: That the duke having already acknowledged Charles for his sovereign, could not take an oath to Henry, without laying himself under the necessity of infringing one or other of these obligations; and that therefore, he would naturally observe the first rather than the last; which he would always c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sider as extorted during his captivity, and which indeed, he could not ob∣serve without forfeiting his title and estate: That he could give no security to which they might have recourse, in case he should violate his oath, on pretence of obeying the absol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te commands of his sovereign: That the reconciliation la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely effected at Calais between the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, seemed rather to presage an union of their interests against the English, than a dissension which might be serviceable to his majesty: That, if any of the noblemen who served the king in France, should happen to be taken in the course of the war, four or five of such prisoners might be exchanged for the duke of Orleans; but, this advantage would be lost by his release: That, should the enlargement of that prince occasion the loss of all the English conquests in France, the people would not fail to exclaim against the king's counsellors, who advised a measure by which the king had been deprived of all the glory and advantage acquired at the price of the late king's life, and of the lives of the dukes of Claren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, Bedford, and such an infinite number of princes, nobles, and gentle∣men, as had died or fallen in France, since the beginning of the dispute: la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly, That the late king, wisely foreseeing the danger that would arise from the release of the duke of Orleans, had in his last moments recommended the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ention of that prince, until a solid peace could be re-established. Such were the principal articles of the protest which the duke of Gloucester made in council, intreating his majesty would order it to be enrolled; and that a copy of it, aut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enticated by the great seal, should be delivered into his hands, that it might serve to acquit him in any future inquiry. The king complied with his desire in this particular; but, his protest did not hinder the council from ex∣ecuting the resolution they had taken in behalf of the duke of Orleans.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>The conventions relating to his enlargement were signed and sealed by both parties on the second day of July; and, he obtained his liberty on much easier conditions than those he had offered of his own accord before the congress at Arras. He was not obliged to acknowledge Henry as king of France; much less, to deliver the towns which he had formerly offered as a security for the performance of his contract. His word and oath were deemed sufficient for the payment of his ransome; which was fixed at one hundred and twenty thousand crowns. He engaged, indeed, to pay one half of the sum before his departure from England, and give the obligations of the dauphin, the duke of Bretagne, and some other princes, for the remainder, to be remitted after his release. He likewise undertook to deliver into the hands of his ma∣jesty, letters patent of king Charles, authorising this agreement; and promising to hold the duke of Orleans as infamous, should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e violate his engagements. Before he quitted England, however, he declared to the council, that he could not possibly raise the first moiety of his ransome, unless they would permit him to visit his estate in France; and he was indulged with leave to absent himself<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</NOTE> for a whole year on that account. Yet, in order to dazzle the eyes of the pub∣lic, which could not, without murmuring, behold the injunction of the late
<PB N="335" REF="3450"/>
king so palpably neglected, Henry declared, by a public act, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat in setting the duke of Orleans at liberty, he did not intend to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontradict the will of his father; and, that his sole view was to hasten the conclusion of a peace. For this purpose, a new convention was made with the duke; in which it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣pulated, that he should exert his utmost endeavours to effect an accommod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion between the two crowns; and, in case of success, he should be acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed of his whole ransome; but, should his efforts miscarry, he promised to return to his captivity in England. This agreement was intirely calculated for the sati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣faction of the people, without any intention of performance. The duke taking leave of England, was conducted to Gravelines, where he renewed his oath for the performance of his engagements, and, on the twelf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h day of No∣vember was met by the duke of Burgundy, whose niece, Margaret of Clev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, he married at St. Omer, according to a late agreement between him and Philip, when the dutchess of Burgundy became responsible to the king of England for the dauphin's obligation, to pay thirty thousand crowns of the ransome.</P>

<P>The duke of Brittany still pretended to observe a neutrality, although the succours which his brother the constable brought, from time to time, into the army of Charles, could not be levied in his country, without his consent or connivance. At another juncture, the English would have resented this col∣lusion; but, considering the present posture of their affairs, they seemed con∣tented with the duke's forbearing to declare openly in favour of their enemies. Nevertheless, as the English and Bretons molested one another by sea, and in∣terrupted trade, to the mutual prejudice of both nations; the king and duke found it convenient to conclude a treaty, by which they mutually engaged to hinder all armaments from being equipped in their harbours, with a view to injure the subjects of each other. The earl of Warwick, who had superseded<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the duke of York as regent of France, dying in the course of this year, the duke resumed that office; and had he been properly supported, might have re∣stored the affairs of England to their former lustre; for, at this period, the dauphin and all the princes of the blood, except the duke of Burgundy, and the count D'Eu, engaged in a league to depose Charles, and raise his son to the throne. Luckily for the French king, they numbered La Tremo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ille among their associates; and, as the constable mortally hated that nobleman, he the more warmly espoused the cause of Charle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and supported him so powerfully, that he was in a condition to maintain his royalty against all the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ederates.

<P>The dutchess of Burgundy having employed all her interest in persuading the two kings to renew the conferences for a peace, they were at length prevailed upon to appoint plenipotentiaries for that purpose; St. Omer was the place pitched upon for the congress; and, the duke of Orleans chosen as one of the mediators. This conference proved as ineffectual as the former. The count<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<PB N="336" REF="3460"/>
they were both peers of England, namely, the bishop of Rochester, and the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd Fanhop. In the reign of Henry V. the French did not take such excep∣tions. They were then glad to confer with simple doctors of the law, pro∣perly authorised. During this negotiation Charles assembled an army, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h which he invested Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il on the river Oyse, which capitulated about the end of April. His next enterprize was the siege of Pontoise, which he undertook with twelve thousand men, in the beginning of July. The dauphin and all the best generals in France were present upon this occasion; and the attacks were carried on with extraordinary valour. The garrison defended themselves with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qual prowess; and, Talbot forcing one of the French quarters, introduced a convoy, which inspired them with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resh courage; so that the besiegers made but slow progress. Notwithstanding all their care and vigilance against the at∣tempts of such a formidable warrior, he found means at three different times, to succour the besieged; but, Charles still obstinately persisted in his resolution to take the place, which he had besieged at the request of the Parisians, who defrayed the whole expence of the enterprize. At length, the duke of York having received a small reinforcement from England, which raised the number of his troops to eight thousand, he approached Pontoise, and sent a herald with a message to the king, challenging him to battle. Charles replied, that he did not intend to regulate his conduct according to the desires of his enemy. The river Oyse ran between the two armies, and the bridge was guarded by a detachment of a thousand men; so that he continued the siege at leisure, with∣out any apprehension of being attacked. The duke of York, however, trans∣ported five or six hundred men by night, in boats made of tanned leather: this detachment falling suddenly upon the guard of the bridge, put them all to the sword, and opened the passage for the rest of the English army. Charles was seized with such consternation at this unforeseen assault, that he forthwith raised the siege, and retired under the cannon of Poissi. Thither he was fol∣lowed by the duke of York, who again challenged him to battle; but, he refused to quit his post; and the regent retreated, after having pillaged the abbey of Poissi, and the neighbouhood. This precipitate retreat from Pontoise, before an army much less numerous than his own, produced great clamours against Charles; whose reputation suffered to such a degree, that his friends gave him to understand, it would be absolutel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessary to re-establish his character by some signal exploit. Thus ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, he marched back to Ponto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, when he was l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast expected, recommenced the siege, which he carried on with surpr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ng vigour; and at length, took the place by assault, he himself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounting the breach among the foremost, and fighting hand to hand with the bravest o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the defenders.

<P>During these transactions in France, the cardinal of Winchester, not contented with having ruined the interest of the duke of Gloucester in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oun∣cil, concerted schemes against the life of that prince, by endeavouring to fix upon him the imputation of high treason. He hoped, that the neglect of the king<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="337" REF="3470"/>
and the repeated <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lights he had sustained from the council, would have pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣voked a man of his warm <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emper to use some expressions that might be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣strued to his prejudice; and he introduced spies into his family, in order <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> watch his conversation. But the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke, with all his imperfections, was to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> warmly attached to his sovereign, to furnish the least handle of this sort against himself; and, the cardinal was obliged to change his battery. Being perfectly well acquainted with the weakness, pride, and ambition of Humphrey's dutch∣ess, he directed his agents to observe her conduct; and they perceived, that sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> maintained a secret correspondence with a priest called Roger Bolinbroke, who pretended to understand negromancy, and a woman who dealt in love-powders and incantations. Sir John Hume another priest, and one Woodhame, who acted as the cardinal's emissaries, found means to insinuate themselves into this cabal; and made such reports of their communication as were judged sufficient grounds for granting a warrant against Bolinbroke; who was no sooner com∣mitted to prison, than the dutchess retired to the sanctuary of Westminster. The rest of the accomplices being seized and examined, a process was formed against her, for having practised <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orcery against the life of the king; by making an image of wax to resemble his majesty, and melting it gradually before the fire, in hope that, as this consumed, the king's constitution would decay. The dutchess being persuaded to quit the sanctuary, was confronted with B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lin∣broke, who denied that there was any intention to deal with the devil, or injure his majesty; and all that the dutchess confessed was, her having consulted those accomplices about giving a love-potion to her husband, to prevent the alienation of his affection. Hume and Woodhame insisted on the circum∣stance of the image; and, the archbishop of Canterbury and York, the car∣dinal of Winchester, and the bishop of Salisbury, who were appointed to in∣quire into this mysterious affair, made a report so unfavourable for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that a court, consisting of the earls of Huntingdon, Stafford, Suffolk, and Northumberland, was erected to try her for high treason. After having ex∣amined all the evidence, they referred the matter to the ec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesiastical court; by which she was sentenced to do public pennance for three days successively, by walk∣ing barefoot and bareheaded, with a wax taper in her hand, through the streets of London to St. Paul's church; and then to be committed to prison for life, to the custody of Sir Thomas Stanley. A sentence which was literally ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cuted; the enemies of Gloucester hoping, that this public disgrace would either ruin his popularity, or provoke him to take some desperate measures against the government: but, they were disappointed in their expectation. The duke was an enthusiast in loyalty, and bore his wrongs with the utmost resignation; and the disgrace of his wife, instead of bringing him into contempt with the people, served only to incense them against his adversaries.</P>

<P>Ever since the duke's credit declined in the council, the war in France seemed almost utterly neglected; and every favourable opportunity of retriev∣ing the English conquests, was overlooked. Immediately after the reduction of Pontoise, the princes of France engaged in a new league against Charles; and this association was headed by the duke of Orleans, who had been incensed at the cold reception he met with from the king, after a captivity of five and twenty years, incurred in the defence of his sovereign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> during which, he had
<PB N="338" REF="3480"/>
done important s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvices to his country. This confederacy would have been much more dangerous than the former, if the king had not pru∣dently detached the duke from it by considerable concessions; and the defec∣tion of this prince broke the me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sures of the associates, who had recourse again to the king's clemency. This storm being overblown, Charles assembled a numerous army to relieve Tartas, a town of Guienne, belonging to the house of Albret; which was besieged by the earl of Huntingdon. The garrison having made a gallant defence till the month of January, at length capitulated, on condition, that the place should be deposited in the hands of two noblemen in that country, to be delivered to the English, if not relieved by the twenty∣fourth day of June. Charles having time enough to make preparations, passed the winter in Poictou, where he mustered a very numerous army; to which all<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1442.</NOTE> the noblemen of the kingdom resorted. In the spring, he began his march to Limoges, from whence he advanced to Montauban; and then took the route to Tholouse, where he summoned the counts of Armagnac and Comminges, to app<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> before the parliament of that city, and answer to the charge of Margaret, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the latter; whom they had detained two and twenty years prisoner in a castle, because she refused to bequeath to her husband the county of Com∣minges, which was her own patrimony. She had married Matthew de Grailly, brother of John <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>unt de Foix; by whom she had one daughter, of an infirm constitution. The father supposing, that the life of this child would not be of long duration<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pressed the countess to declare him heir to his own daughter; but, she resisted all his sollicitations. Her refusal produced a quarrel and sepa∣ration. The husband agreed to a partition of her territories with the count d'Armagnac; who attacked, defeated, and took the countess prisoner. During her confinement, however, she found means to make a will in favour of her daughter; and, in case of her death, beque<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thing her county of Comminges to Charles VII. king of France. The daughter dying in a little time after this will was executed; and Charles being informed of the clause in his favour, he resolved to set the countess at liberty, and obtain her confirmation of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>relet.</NOTE> will. It was for this purpose that he summoned her husband and the count de Armagnac to Tholouse; whither this last was obliged to bring the old coun∣tess now turned of fourscore. She was immediately set at liberty; and her will being confirmed by a decree of the parliament, Charles took possession of the county of Comminges. The count of Armagnac was not only obliged to part with his acquisition; but, even forbid to exercise the rights of regality within his own territories. He looked upon this severity as a very ungrateful requital for all the services which his family had done to the crown of France; and resolved to take the first opportunity of revenging himself upon Charles. In these sentiments, he sent ambassadors to demand the protection of Henry, and offer one of his daughters in marriage to that monarch. His proposal be∣ing examined in council, was accepted. The king forthwith appointed am∣bassadors to regula<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ditions of the match, and conclude the alliance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

The English council was not ignorant of the French king's preparations for this expedition; but they took no steps to oppose his design; and seemed in∣tirely
<PB N="339" REF="3490"/>
to neglect the defence of Guienne, which was now upon the point of being withdrawn from the dominion of England. Charles made himself ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter of St. Sever; invested Ais, which surrendered after a siege of seven weeks; La Reole was taken by storm; Marmande fell into the hands of the French; and Charles after these conquests retired to Tholouse, where he spent the winter.</P>

<P>At length the English seemed to wake from their infatuation, and re∣solved to make a diversion, at the other end of the kingdom. Five thousand men being levied in England, the command of them was given to Talbot, lately created earl of Shrewsbury, who, landing in Normandy, soon compelled the Bastard of Orleans to quit the field. While the earl besieged the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle of Couches, the other, who was lately honoured with the title of count de Dunois, endeavoured to make a diversion, by investing Galardon; but Couches being taken in a few days, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did not think proper to wait for the English, who ad∣vanced to give him battle. When Dunois retired, the earl of Shrewsbury marched to Dieppe, the most important place which the French king possessed in Normandy; and as he had not a sufficient number of troops to carry on the siege in form, he took by assault the fort of Charles-Mesnil, situated on the mountain of Polet, so as to command the avenues of the town; and as the month of November was already well advanced, he resolved to block up the town during the winter. With this view he enlarged the fort he had taken, repaired the works, raised his batteries, and leaving the conduct of the siege to his natural son, returned to England, to sollicit a more considerable reinforce∣ment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. de Char.

plenipote<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iary for-negotiating a peace, he had sent the archbishop of York to persuade his maje<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y to renounce his title to the crown of France, to the disgrace of the king and his illustrious ancestors: That the enlargement of the duke of Or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eans had been procured by his intrigues and those of the duke of York, agai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t the express injunction of the late king: That, in the station of chancel∣lor, he hims<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf had purchased lands of the king, instead of preventing such alie∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions, according to the duty of his office: That, in granting commissions in the army to none but his own creatures, he had been the occasion of all the losses sustained in France: And that he had sold commissions to persons un∣qualified for the service. These articles were read in council; but, as all the members were devoted to the cardinal, they admitted the act of amnesty which had been passed in favour of that prelate, to whom the king granted a new<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> pardon. The cardinal was by this time in full possession of the court and coun∣cil. He had introduced the earl of Suffolk into the service of Henry, who conceived such an affection for that nobleman, that he was entirely guided by his direction. This favourite represented Winchester as the subject upon whose parts and fidelity his chief dependence ought to be placed; and John Kemp archbi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hop of York seconded his recommendation. Not contented with extol∣ling the character of the cardinal, they took all opportunities of reviling Glou∣cester, whom they painted as a very dangerous nobleman, who had designs upon the crown, and who endeavoured to engage his majesty in false measures, by which he might incur the hatred and contempt of his subjects. The king, who was equally destitute of spirit and penetration, believed these suggestions: and the duke's impatient temper seemed to confirm their accusations; for he could not endu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the daily mortifications to which he was exposed, without expressing his resentment, and even denouncing vengeance against his adversaries.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ch. 1443.</NOTE> In the beginning of the year, a secret negotiation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was brought upon the carpet between Henry and the duke of Burgundy, who, despairing of a general accommodation, resolved to extricate himself from a ruinous war, by means of a particular truce with England. This he was the rather disposed to conclude, as he had reasons to be dissatisfied with Charles; to believe the recon∣ciliation was altogether political on the side of the French king; and that so soon as his affairs should be re-established, his former animosity would be re∣vived. He therefore thought he should act against his own interest in assisting him to finish a war, the success of which might render him too powerful; and he vested his dutchess with full power, to conclude a general truce for all his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ominions with the king of England. That which was already made, related only to the commerce between the Low Countries and that kingdom; but this which the dutchess concluded in April, comprehended Burgundy and all the duke's territories in general, to continue in force until one of the parties should renounce the engagement; in which case, he should give notice of his intention<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>elet.</NOTE> three months before the actual rupture. The blockade of Dieppe had now contin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed eight months, during which no succours arrived from England; and Charles resolving to relieve the place before the arrival of the expected re∣inforcement, the dauphin earnestly sollicited the command of this expedition.

measures. These considerations, however, yielded to the necessity of relieving Dieppe, which was now reduced to extremity. The dauphin began his march from Guienne with four thousand horse; and perceiving that the fort of Charles-Mesnil, possessed by the English, was impregnable from the side of the country, he threw himself into the place in spite of all their opposi∣tion. Without giving them time to recollect themselves, he made a sally with all his forces; and attacking it on the side of the town, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epulsed in three successive assaults: in the fourth, however, he carried the place sword in hand; and the English, finding themselves thus disabled from continuing the blockade, retired in good order. John duke of Somerset arrived from England in about five days after their retreat, and brought a reinforcement of five thousand men, which, had it landed sooner, might have prevented the dauphi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s success: but the blockade being raised, all he could do was to ravage part of the country, and reduce some inconsiderable castl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</P>

She was a princess of great beauty, spirit, pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etration, and fortitude; and extremely well calculated for answe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the expect<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion of Suffolk, who had already pre∣possessed Henry in her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vour, in hope of eng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging her in the cabal against the popular duke of Glou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>er. Though the proposal was extremely agreeable to France, Charles, who knew the impati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce of Henry and his council, managed the treaty with such address, that the earl of Suffolk, instead of demanding a dower with Margaret, promi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, in the name of his master, that the whole pro∣vince of Maine <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould be e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded to her uncle, Charles of Anjou. The articles of the marriage being adju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, the earl returned to England to lay his transactions before the ministry, that they might be approved and confirmed by the king and council. The duke of Gloucester, who now for the first time understood the nature of the treaty, vehemently opposed it with two reasons, which indeed were unanswerable. He observed, that the king was already engaged in a con∣tract of marriage with the daughter of the count of Armagnac, which he could not renounce with any regard to honour and good faith; and that Maine, being the bulwark of Normandy, could not be ceded without exposing this whole province to the most imminent danger. This, like all his other remonstrances, was neglected, and the earl of Suffolk empowered to espouse the princess Mar∣garet, as Henry's pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. That weak prince was so well pleased with this pre∣posterous alliance, that, in token of his satisfaction, he created the earl marquis of Suffolk; John Holland earl of Huntingdon was promoted to the dukedom of Exeter; Humphrey earl of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rafford was honoured with the title of duke of Buckingham; and that of duke of Warwick bestowed upon Henry, son of the late earl, who had been regent in France. The nuptials were solemnized in the city of Tours, in presence of king Charles and all his court, with such mag∣nificence as but ill agreed with the poverty of the bride, and the low circum∣stances of both nations.

<P>Notwithstanding all these insinuations, he would not, by absent∣ing himself from the parliament, give the least occasion for suspecting him guilty of crimes to which he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a stranger; and he went to Edmundsbury at the time appointed, secure in the consciousness o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his own innocence.

All the duke's well-wishers, though incensed at the i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>justice of this arrest, took it for granted that he would acquit himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> honour∣ably on his trial, and were the less alarmed for that very reason: but the un∣fort<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> prince had no opportunity to manife<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the falsity of the charge.

<P>Even this instance of lenity, so contrary to the nature of Suffolk, could not efface the impressions which had been made upon the public by the murder of Good Duke Humphrey. Henry himself was not suspected of having been concerned in this tragedy, but the queen was universally reviled as the author of the deed; and the marquis, with the rest of the ministry, were cursed by the people with the most bitter impr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ations. Nothing more clearly de∣monstrates the weakness of human foresight, than the fate of the duke of Gloucester; in consequence of which the queen believed herself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ised above all opposition; whereas it proved the introduction of numberless ealamities, which she and her family underwent in the sequel, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause it furnished the duke of York with an opportunity to advance his pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sions to the crown, which in all probability he would not have maintained, or even <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to publish, during the life of the duke of Gloucester. The cardinal of Win∣chester did not long survive the death of his adversary, in which he had been principally concerned. In less than five weeks after the duke's dec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase, this haughty prelate was seized with a distemper that brought him to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> grave; and he died with all the terrors of a guilty conscience. His d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h deprived the queen, and her favourite Suffolk, of the great weight and influence which was attached to the cardinal's power and immense fortune; and left the marquis more than ever exposed to the hatred and invectives of the people.</P>

<P>The time fixed for the conclusion of the peace with France being elapsed, and no steps taken towards that desirable event, they clamoured against Suffolk, and did not scruple to tax him aloud with having betrayed the interest of his country, in yielding Le Maine to the French; and, in lieu of a solid peace, trumping up a ruinous truce, during which the enemy forti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed themselves at leisure. These clamours increasing every day, the marquis de∣sired he might be allowed to justify his conduct before the king; and a day being fixed for that purpose, he, in presence of several noblemen attached to his interest, explained all his transactions in France, and produced the order of council by virtue of which he had acted. The king was so well sati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed with his defence, that he publicly acquitted him of all misconduct; issued letters<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>patent under the great seal, declaring him innocent of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the imputa∣tions laid to his charge, and forbidding his subjects, on pain of incurring his displeasure, to say or act any thing to the prejudice of his character. Even this testimony of his innocence could not silence the murmurs of the public. They not only abhorred him as the author of Gloucester's death, and as the traitor who had given away Le Maine; but they hated him still more im∣placably, for having effected the marriage between the king and Margaret, which they looked upon as one of the greatest calamities that ever had hap∣pened to England. They could not bear the administration of this foreign princess, whose rule was insolent and arbitrary, and who made no other use of the king but that of giving a sanction to her own measures. He was generally employed at his devotions; and she took care to encourage him in those exercises of religion, that his mind and attention might be wholly aliena<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed from the affairs of government. She seemed to despise her murmurs of the people, in defiance of whom she raised her favourite to the dignity of duke of Suffolk, and cultivated such an intimacy of communication with that noblemen as proved of very little advantage to her character.</P>

We have already observed that he was heir to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> descended from Lio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el, third son of Edward III. and consequently his ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e was preserable to that of Henry, who sprang from the lions of John of Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, who was Lio∣nel's younger brother. Before Richard would embark in any measures for the support of his pretensions, he thought proper to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the inclinations of the people, by emissaries who took occasion, from the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>potic government of Margaret, to observe, that the people were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a double u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urpation: that Margaret usurped a power which she had no right to exercise, suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng her husband to be lawful king of England; but that the royalty of the hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Lancaster was founded upon usurpation, which, though it had been ren∣dered tolerable by the shining vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tues of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e king<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w become in∣supportable, considering the weakness of Henry, and the pride of his queen, the descendant of a family which had always been at mortal enmity with the English nation; and that, in such an emergency, the people ought to turn their eyes upon the duke of York, who was the true heir of the crown, a prince of great qualities and eminent virtue, who had already done the most impor∣tant services to his country. Such insinuations, artfully circulated, raised up a great number of partisans to the duke, who did not seem to interest himself in the subject; though the observations of the people on this occasion alarmed the queen and the whole house of Lancaster. They did not doubt but Richard was at the bottom of all this clamour; and they resolved to diminish his credit, by subjecting him to some mortification, and encouraging the rival of his power and reputation. This was Edmund duke of Somerset, who was created regent of France, without any regard to the commission of the duke of York, granted for a term of years not yet expired. Somerset's brother had been always at variance with Richard; and at this juncture Edmund treated him with such insolence as produced an irreconcilable animosity between the houses; though the duke of York at present dissembled his resentment.</P>

Yet, as it was necessary to examine the particulars of the affair, that they might be com∣municated to the court of England, the duke of Bretagne could not brook the delay, but complained to the king of France of this infraction of the truce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in which his dominions had been expresly comprehended. Charles thought this a favourable opportunity to make advantage of Henry's weakness, and the discontents of the English people, to which he was no stranger. He af∣fected to enter warmly into the resentment of the duke, and sent two ambas∣sadors to London to demand reparation for the affront, as well as the payment of sixteen hundred thousand crowns, to indemnify his vassal for the loss he had sustained. The court of England was not a little astonished at the de∣mand of such an exorbitant sum, as well as at the eagerness with which Charles espoused the quarrel of the duke of Bretagne, who had not been com∣prehended in the treaty as his ally or vassal, but merely as a neutral prince, who had often acted as mediator between the two monarchs. The ministry, however, assured the ambassadors that the king would indemnify the duke, as soon as the particulars of his loss should be ascertained; and they were given to understand, that if Charles would send envoys to Louviers, they should be met by ambassadors from England, empowered to settle all matters in dispute between them and their allies. Conferences were accordingly opened at this place, where the English plenipotentiaries observed that Fou∣geres had been surprized without the consent or knowledge of the regent; and that the sum demanded greatly exceeded the damage which the duke had sus∣tained. The French ambassadors, without paying the least regard to these remonstrances, told them in a peremptory manner, that unless the duke of Bretagne should receive the satisfaction required, their master would consider the truce as infringed; so that the conferences were immediately at an end. Charles was so intent upon recommencing hostilities, while Henry was altogether unprepared for a rupture, that if the court of England had agreed to comply with his demand, he would have found another cause for rekindling the flames of war; and even made a pretence of their having vio∣lated the truce with Scotland, before the death of James, the manner of which we have already related. Nevertheless, he still amused the English ministry with negotiations, under the cover of which he prepared for opening the campaign; while Henry's council seemed to sleep at the helm, and took not the least precaution against the brewing storm. They did not even restore the town of Fougeres, or endeavour in any shape to appease the duke of Brittany, who was so justly incensed. One would be apt to imagine, that Margaret, having no children of her own to engage her interest and affection in the cause of the English, co-operated with the designs of her family in France, and by her negligence favoured the expulsion of her husband's troops from her na∣tive country. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1449.</NOTE> As soon as Charles found himself in a condition to renew the war, he, in the name of the duke of Bretagne, surprized the castle of Couches, and Pont-de l'Arche in Normandy, Gerbay in the Beauvoisis, Cognac and St. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>grin in Guienne. The English complained of the violation of the truce; but were given to understand, these were acts of reprisal on account of Fou∣geres. Thus the war recommenced, at a time when the duke of Somerset was a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>together unprovided with troops to defend the English possessions; so that the field was left free for Charles to extend his conquests. His principal aim was to reduce Normandy to his obedience: for which purpose he had prepared four different armies, one of which he headed in person; the command of another he bestowed upon the count de Dunois, lately created count of Longueville; the duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Alençon conducted the third; and the duke of Brittany commanded the fourth, totally composed of his own forces. All the places of Normandy were ill provided with garrisons and ammunition, and the majority of the governors confiding in the truce, had repaired to Eng∣land; so that Charles met with very little opposition in subduing the province. Many places surrendered at sight of the French army. In some towns the in∣habitants expelled the English garrisons; others were sold by their com∣manders. None of them made any resistance but Pont-audemer, and Chateau∣gail<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd: in a word, before the end of the campaign, Charles was in a con∣cition to besiege the capital city of Rouen, which was invested on the eighth day of October.</P>

<P>He did not think it necessary to undertake the siege in form, because he knew that the duke of Somerset and the earl of Shrewsbury, who commanded the garrison, which did not exceed three thousand men, would not be able to defend the place against the inhabitants; for he carried on a correspondence with the townsmen, and they assured him that they would take arms in his favour. On the first day of the siege, the count of Dunois was on the point of being introduced with three hundred men, when Shrewsbury chancing to come up, had the good fortune to repulse the detachment. This miscarriage did not alter the resolution of the inhabitants, who, on the nine∣teenth day of October, rose as one man, and opened the gates to the be∣siegers. All that the regent could do, was to station the garrison at the prin∣cipal posts of the city, from which, however, they were soon dislodged. So∣merset and Shrewsbury retreated to the palace with eight hundred men; but, as they foresaw their provision would soon fail, the duke demanded a parley with king Charles. This being granted, he offered to retire on honourable con∣ditions; but the king insisted upon his surrendering at discretion, unless he had a mind to treat for the rest of Normandy that remained in the hands of the English. Thus repulsed, the duke retired to the palace, which he defended twelve days; at the expiration of which he saw himself obliged to capitulate, on condition of leaving all his artillery, paying fifty thousand crowns of gold, and restoring to the French king Caudebec, Arques, Lillebonne, Tancarville, Montrevil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers, and Har<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leur.

<P>These disasters were the more severely felt at the court of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1450.</NOTE> as they were followed by a rebellion in Ireland, which hindered the mi∣nistry from sending the necessary supplies to France. Nevertheless, the queen and the duke of Suffolk hoped to derive some advantage from that in∣surrection. They seized this opportunity of removing the duke of York, on pretence of creating him governor of Ireland, where they thought he would perish. But he baffled their expectation; and, by his obliging and insinuating manners, not only appeased the commotion, without drawing his sword, but even engaged the people of that country in his interest, to which they con∣tinued firmly attached in the sequel. The loss of Normandy in one campaign, after so much blood and treasure had been expended in the conquest of that province, together with the rapid progress of Charles in other pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of France, began to produce a violent fermentation in the impatient humour of the English. The whole kingdom resounded with complaints against the duke of Suffolk, who was publicly reproached with having betrayed the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and co-operated with the queen in favour of the French monarch. The coun∣cil consisted wholly of their creatures, who likewise filled all the posts of dig∣nity and profit. The duke of Somerset, who had contracted for the defence of Normandy, was accused of having misapplied the money payed for that service. A numerous body of men at arms having been raised by Humphrey duke of Buckingham, on condition that they should receive a whole year<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s pay in advance; the treasurer refused to comply with the terms of the con∣tract, and the duke returning to court from the sea-side, when they were ready to embark, resigned his commission, saying publicly to the king, <Q>“Sir, take heed of your government; you are misled by traitors: and if I had landed in Normandy with your forces, I am persuaded we should have been sold to the enemy.”</Q> Suffolk being present, and supposing this decla∣ration aimed at him, was so incensed that he drew a dagger, and would have slain Humphrey, had not the byestanders interposed. This insolent behaviour, in the royal presence, roused even the indignation of Henry, who could scarce be dissuaded from sending him to the Tower; and it served to complete the aversion of the nobility and people<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who not only exclaimed against the queen and him in all public places, but also published a great number of libels, affixing them to the doors of churches, and every remarkable place in the city of London.</P>

He observed, that the first, relating to Margaret, could not possibly be true, since she was not the next heir of the crown by law; and, he appealed to several lords, to vouch for his design of marrying his son to the duke of Warwick's daughter. With respect to the other articles, he referred to acts of council and parliament for his justification; and affirmed, that the bi∣shop of Chichester had misrepresented the words spoken by him in the St<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣chamber. On the seventeenth day of March, the lords spiritual and temporal were assembled in the king's chamber.

submitted himself to the king's pleasure.

<P>The death of this nobleman was the prelude to a great many popular commotions. John Ayscough, bishop of Sarum, was murdered in Wiltshire. Thomas Thany, a fuller, attempted to raise an insurrection in Kent, but was taken and executed at Canterbury. The whole nation was now in a ferment; and nothing was heard but complaints and menaces against the queen and ministry. The duke of York, who still remained in Ireland, being by Suffolk's fate freed from a powerful antagonist, resolved to improve the po∣pular discontent for his own advantage; but, before he would personally ap∣pear in support of his pretensions, he thought it would be necessary to prepare the nation for his design, by exciting their affection for the house of Mortimer. For this purpose, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e employed an Irishman, called John Cade, who had served under him as a soldier in France, to raise a sedition in England in favour of the family of March, that their title, which had lain dormant so long, might once more attract the attention of the public. Cade, who was a man of un∣daunted resolution, great cunning, and some discernment, being properly in∣structed by the duke's agents, assumed the name of John Mortimer, pretending to be son of Sir John Mortimer, who had been beheaded for treason in the last reign; and, repairing to the county of Kent, in which the duke of York had a great number of partisans, he assembled a strong body of malecontents, on pretence of reforming the government and easing the people of their taxes. The number of his followers increased in a few days to such a degree, that he thought himself in a condition to execute his scheme; and, approaching London, encamped on Blackheath. The king being informed of this com∣motion, sent a message to demand the cause of their assembling in arms; and, Cade answered, in the name of the community, that they had no intention to hurt the person of his majesty; but, their design was to address the parliament, that all civil ministers might be brought to condign punishment, and the people be allowed to live more happily than they had lived since the beginning of Suffolk's ministry. They accordingly presented two addresses to parliament, ex∣plaining the grievances of the nation; and, among other things, demanded that
<PB N="353" REF="3630"/>
the duke of Somerset should be punished for the loss of Normandy; and, that the king's council might be composed of princes of the blood, and other wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and worthy persons; not by vicious wretches, void of virtue and capacity. These petitions being communicated to the king, the council deemed them seditious; and resolved to suppress the insurrection by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orce of arms. Henry, having assembled a body of fifteen thousand men, marched at their head towards Blackheath. At his approach Cade retired, as if he had been afraid of an engagement, and lay in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbush in a wood, not doubting but that he should be pursued by the king's whole army; but, Henry believing they were totally dispersed, returned towards London, after having sent a detachment in pursuit of the fugitives, under the command of the lord Stra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ord, who falling into the amb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scade, was cut in pie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es with all his followers. Cade, immediately after this action, began his march to London, while the king and court leaving a garrison in the Tower, commanded by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord Sca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, retired with precipita∣tion to the castle of Kenilworth. The city of London, intimidated by the success of the insurgents, opened its gates at their approach; and, Cade entered in tri∣umph, at the head of his forces, which had been con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iderably increased since his late advantage. But, he forbade his followers, on the most severe penalties, to commit the least disorder, or give any cause of complaint to the inhabitants. Next day, being informed that the treasurer, lord Say, was in the city, he caused him to be apprehended and beheaded, without any form of trial; and, in the evening, retired to the Borough of Southwark. For some days, he continued the prac∣tice of entering the city in the morning, and quitting it at night, that he might not give umbrage to the burghers, with whom he lived at first in very good understanding. But, at length, the insurgents having plundered some houses, and committed other outrages, Cade, one morning, found the gate of the bridge shut and sec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red against him. Endeavouring to force his way, an engagement en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ued between the rebels and citizens, which lasted all day, and was not interrupted until the combatants could see no longer to fight. The archbishop of Canterbury, and the chancellor, who had taken re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uge in the Tower, being informed by their emissaries of the disposition of the insurgents, who were disheartened by this check, and heartily tired of rebellion, drew up an act of amnesty, confirmed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anction of the great seal, and found means to publish it by night in the Borough of Southwark. The effect of this expedient was so sudden and surprising, that by day-break, Cade saw himself abandoned by the greater number of his followers, and retreated to Rochester, where the rest of them dispersed, notwith<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tanding all his remonstrances and artful speeches, in which he endeavoured to persuade them, that the pardon was ineffectual, with∣out the authority of parliament.

<P>While the peace of England was interrupted by this insurrection, the war continued in France; but, still to the disadvantage of the English. The queen perceiving, that the dissatisfaction of the people proceeded in a great measure from the bad success of the English arms in that kingdom, had made an effort to retrieve her credit, by sending a reinforcement of four thou∣sand men, under the command of Sir Thomas Kyrle, who landed at Cherbourg
<PB N="354" REF="3640"/>
in Normandy; and proceeded for Caen, where the duke at that time resided. In his march he was joined by several small detachments from English garri∣sons in that neighbourhood, and took Valognes, after a siege of three weeks. The constable of Richemont informed of these operations, assembled a body <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f seven thousand men, and posted himself at Fourmigni, to intercept the Eng∣lish in their route. Kyrle, tho' greatly inferior in number, attacked them with∣out hesitation; but, after an obstinate engagement, his troops were defeated, and he himself remained in the hands of the enemy. This reinforcement being destroyed, the duke of Somerset was obliged to keep within the walls of Caen, and see the French extend their conquests without opposition. The towns of Vere, Bayeux, St. Sauveur le Vicomte, Valognes, Avranches, and Tombe∣laine, surrendered almost without resistance; and, upon the seventh day of June, the city of Caen was invested. The garrison consisted of four thousand men inured to service; but, the duke capitulated to surrender the place, if not relieved by the first day of July, on condition, that the garrison should be at liberty to retire with their effects to England. Falaise being invested at the same time, Sir Andrew Trollop, who commanded the garrison consisting of fifteen hundred men, capitulated on the same conditions; and the reduction of Cherbourg, the garrison of which submitted on the twelfth day of August<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> finished the intire conquest of Normandy. In the month of September, the count de Dunois was sent with a detachment into Guienne, where he reduced Berg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rac, Jensac, Montferrand, St. Foy, and Chalais, before the end of the campaign. In May he took the field again; and, in the course of that month, took Montguyon, Blaye, Bourg, Fron<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ac, Libourne, and Ca∣stillon in Perigord: and Bourdeaux was surrendered by capitulation, because not relieved before Midsummer. This was the case with all the places in that neighbourhood. Dax was reduced by the counts of Foix and Armagnac, the lord of Albret, and other Gascon barons; and Bayonne, which was blocked up by sea and land, submitted on the twenty-sixth day of August. Thus, the whole province of Guienne fell under the dominion of Charles, after it had been united three hundred years to the crown of England. The towns were well affected to the English government; but, the great lords, tempted with the hope of preferment at the court of France, co-operated with the efforts of Charles, in wresting this country from the king of England, who was now dispossessed of every foot of land which his ancestors had acquired in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. de Charles VII.</NOTE> except Calais and its dependencies.</P>

<P>When the duke of Somerset returned to England, the parliament was sitting; and the outcry agains<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him was so loud and universal, that the commons could not help taking some notice of his conduct. They accord∣ingly presented an address to his majesty, desiring, that the regent might be committed to the Tower, until his behaviour in France could be properly ex∣amined. Henry did not think proper to refuse the request of the commons at such a juncture; and the populace were so transported with joy at the news of the duke's commitment, that they went immediately to his house, which they pillaged; and, notwithstanding a proclamation issued to disperse them, conti∣nued in a body, doing abundance of mischief, until some o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their leaders were apprehended, and hanged in terrorem.

of Suffolk, William Bothe bishop of Chester, John Sutton, lord Dudley, and others; but, Henry amused them with an equivocal answer. Then they brought in an act of attainder for corrupting the blood, and confiscating the lands of the late duke of Suffolk; but, this act was rejected by the king, and the humour of the commons growing every day more and more obstinate, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>The court was now involved in great perplexity and uneasiness<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 145<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> about the duke of York, who was supposed to have excited the late insurrection, and to be employed in hatching other more dangerous schemes against the go∣vernment. The sudden death of Cade had prevented any confession, of which they might have taken the advantage to the prejudice of Richard, whom they could not now arrest without incurring the imputation of injustice; but, as they were apprehensive of his raising an army in Ireland, to support his title to the crown, the king issued orders to the sheriffs of Wales, Shropshire, and Cheshire, to assemble, each, his different posse, and oppose his landing. This was a very impolitic precaution, as it not only published his apprehension of the duke of York, which it was his interest to conceal; but, it alarmed the duke so as to put him on his guard, and furnished him with a plausible pretext to take arms in his own defence. As the duke had not yet formed any digested project, nor taken the least step that could be construed into a misdeanour, he wrote a letter to Henry, complaining of his suspicion as injurious, and calcu∣lated for a pretence to ruin his character and fortune. He received a mild an∣swer from the king, who promised, that he should have satisfaction; but in the mean time the orders were not recalled. Tho' Cade's enterprize had not suc∣ceeded, the duke of York did not fail to reap considerable advantages from that insurrection. The great number of people who joined or favoured that cause, plainly demonstrated, that the nation was full of malecontents; and, that the title of the house of March was still remembered with regard. He conceived fresh hopes from these considerations; believing, that if the very name of a person belonging to that family had armed such a number in his cause, he who was a prince of the blood royal, and the lawful representative of Mortimer, could not fail to raise the better part of the kingdom in support of his preten∣sions. That he might not, however, ruin his project by too much precipitation, he resolved to consult his friends, before he would engage in an enterprize of such moment; and, when the term of his government in Ireland was expired, he embarked for England, in order to confer with them upon this subject. Not∣withstanding the vigilance of the sheriffs, he landed without opposition, and repaired to London, where his adherents waited for him with impatience. The principal of these were, John Mowbray duke of Norfolk; Richard Nevil earl of Salisbury, in right of his wife, daughter to him who was slain at the siege of Orleans; his son Richard Nevil, afterwards earl of Warwick, by his marriage with Anne Beauchamp, daughter of that earl who died in France; Thomas Courtney, earl of Devonshire, the son-in-law of the duke of Somerset; and Edward Brook, baron of Cobham.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. The court being on a progress to the western counties, these con∣federates had an opportunity of concerting their measures without molestation;
<PB N="356" REF="3660"/>
and the result of their conferences was, that the duke of York should retire to Wales, where the house of March had always great influence, and secure the assistance of his friends, in such manner, that he should be able to assemble an army at pleasure. These previous steps being taken, he should write to the king, informing him of the discontents of the people; and, desiring that justice might be done upon the duke of Somerset. According to this resolution, he retired; and having secured the people of Wales in his interest, wrote a remonstrance to Henry, importing that the whole kingdom was disgusted at his conduct in countenancing traitors; and, that he could not help taking the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berty of advising him to prevent the fatal consequences of popular dissatis∣faction. He exhorted him to bring delinquents to justice; and in particular, to give up the duke of Somerset, who, tho' accused by the house of commons, had been set at liberty, and re-established in his majesty's favour, without hav∣ing undergone the least examination; and, in case the king should be disposed to grant that satisfaction to the people, he offered to assist him with all his power in the execution of such a laudable design. The court easily perceived, that he wanted no more than a pretence for revolting; and, as they were re∣solved, that the odium of a rupture should not lie with them, the king favoured him with a civil answer, in which he assured him, that he had laid down a re∣solution to reform the abuses of his government; for which purpose, he was determined to choose a certain number of wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and virtuous counsellors, among whom, the duke of York should be one of the first; that no traitor should be countenanced, or even pass with impunity; but, the punishment of such delinquents being an affair of great consequence, required the most ma∣ture deliberation: as to the duke of Somerset, in particular, he should be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stoae<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nals.</NOTE> brought to answer any accusations laid to his charge in a legal manner.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1452.</NOTE> This was such an instance of condescension, as deprived the duke of York of all pretence of taking up arms. Nevertheless, as he had prepared an army, and looked upon this shew of moderation as a lure to decoy him into blind security, he resolved to prosecute his design of removing the duke of Somerset from the council, and proceed or desi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as he himself should see it convenient or practicable. He therefore assembled his troops, and began his march for London; but, he did not find the court so unprepared as he had imagined: the queen no sooner understood that he had retired to Wales, than guessing his design, she began to levy forces in the king's name, without mentioning the service for which they were destined; so that the duke had scarce begun his march, when he received intelligence, that the king was ad∣vancing at the head of an army to give him battle. Surprised at this infor∣mation, he did not think proper to expose himself to the issue of an engage∣ment, until he should be furnished with a better pretext for fighting against his sovereign. He hoped the people would espouse his cause, and was very de∣sirous of engaging the city of London in his interest, before he should venture to declare his real design. He therefore, instead of waiting for the king's ap∣proach, changed his route; and, by forced marches arrived before him at Lon∣don, where he expected to be received with open arms. He had the mortifi∣cation, however, to find the gates shut upon him, and the inhabitants deter∣mined against taking any step in his favour, while the king was at his heels with a more numerous army than that which he commanded. In this emer∣gency,
<PB N="357" REF="3670"/>
gency, he was obliged to pass the Thames at Kingston, and intrench himself at Brentheath, at the distance of twelve miles from London. The king follow∣ing him by the way of London-bridge, encamped within four miles of him; and sent two bishops to know the cause of his appearing in arms against the government.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The duke, disappointed in one part of his expectations, resolved to temporize, that he might not ruin his affairs by too much precipitation. He replied, that his intention was not to renounce his obedience to the king, but solely to remove from him all the evil counsellors, of whom the duke of Somerset was the principal; and, that if his majesty would commit that noble∣man to prison, and detain him in confinement till the meeting of the next par∣liament, he would immediately disband his forces. He concluded that his demand would be rejected by the king and queen, as they were intirely governed by the person against whom he had remonstrated; and he hoped their refusal would be of great service to his cause, in demonstrating the queen's resolution to involve the nation in a civil war, rather than part with her minion, who was odious to the whole kingdom. Here again, he was mistaken in his conjec∣ture. The king immediately accepted the proposal, assuring him, that Somer∣set should be sent to the Tower; and, that nobleman was immediately put under arrest. The duke of York was not a little surprized at this condescen∣sion, and wished he could have revoked his engagement; but, as he could not retract without declaring his real aim too openly, he determined to run some risque in his own person, rather than forfeit the favour of the people, on which his chief hope of success was founded. Without the least hesitation he disbanded his troops; and visited the king, tho' unprovided with any security for the safety of his person. When he was introduced to his majesty, he accused the duke of Somerset as a traitor who had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acrificed the interest of the kingdom to his avarice and ambition. The duke, who stood concealed in the tent, hearing his character thus impeached, quitted his hiding-place; and not only denied the charge with great warmth, but in his turn, taxed York with a traiterous design to dethrone his majesty. Richard, seeing his antagonist at liberty in the king's tent, after having been assured, that he was in confinement, perceived he had been duped; and at once comprehended the danger of his own situa∣tion. Nevertheless, without appearing di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>concerted, he complained of the deceit which had been practi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed upon him by the suggestions of the duke of Somerset, on whom he affected to lay the blame of this double-dealing. The court was at very little pains to excuse the collusion; and when York took his leave of Henry, and would have retired, he was arrested by the king's order. If his enemies had followed the impulse of their anim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sity, he never would have extricated himself from the snare in which he was intangled by his own imprudence: but, several circumstances concurred towards his preservation. The queen and Somer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et dreaded the resentment of the people, among whom he had acquired great influence and favour. The court had received false intel∣ligence, that his son Edward, the young earl of March, accompanied by all the friends of the family, was at the head of a strong army advancing to the duke's assistance; and, at this very juncture, deputies arrived from Gascony, with offers of renouncing the dominion of France, if the king of England would send a body of troops for their support. They foresaw, that the death of the

<P>King Henry was not more disturbed by the influence and designs of York, than Charles of France was perplexed and chagrined with the con∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct of the dauphin, who was proud, turbulent, and ambitious. He resided in Dauphiné, where he acted as sovereign, and payed very little regard to the orders of his father. He had even demanded in marriage Yolante daughter to the duke of Savoy; and that prince had granted his request, without deigning to intimate the design to king Charles, who was so much incensed at their pre∣sumption, that he assembled an army of thirty thousand men, and marched towards Lyons, to chastise his son, and punish the duke of Savoy for this con∣tempt of his character and authority: but he was diverted from his purpose by an unexpected revolution in Guienne. The Gascons had acknowleged the French dominion for no other reason than that of being left destitute of resource by the English; and the army of Charles had no sooner quitted Guienne, than the nobility, in concert with the inhabitants of Bourdeaux, resolved to recal their ancient masters. For this purpose they sent deputies to London; and as soon as the commotions were appeased, the queen and council deliberated upon their proposals, which they approved. They concluded that the success of such an enterprize would raise their credit among the people; and they determined to send over a body of forces, under the command of the renowned Talbot earl of Shrewsbury, who had lately returned from a voyage to Italy. Though he was now fourscore years of age, he engaged in the service with his usual alacrity, and immediately embarked with seven hundred men at arms, leaving the rest of the troops destined for that expedition, to follow with the first opportunity. He landed near Bourdeaux on the twenty-first day of October; and next day, being introduced into that city by the burghers, surprized and took the greater part of the French garrison. Being joined in a few days by the rest of the troops from England, he took the field at the head of seven thousand men, and reduced Fronsac and Castillon, together with some other places, before he was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pere Daniel.</NOTE> obliged to put his troops into winter-quarters.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1453.</NOTE> Charles was at Lyons when he received the disagreeable news of Talbot's arrival and progress; and immediately altered his resolution with regard to the dauphin, that he might unite all his endeavours for the preserva∣tion of Guienne. He approved of the match between his son and Yolante; and bestowed one of his own daughters on the prince of Piedmont. He resolved to send all his forces into Guienne in the spring; and in the mean time detached a body of ten thousand men, under the command of Chabanes and the count de Penthievre, who, arriving in Saintonge, invested Chalain and Castillon, while the count of Clermont followed with the rest of the army. Chabanes, having
<PB N="359" REF="3690"/>
reduced Chalain in the beginning of June, joined Penthievre before Castillon, which continued to make a vigorous defence; and the dread of Talbot's valour and experience induced them to fortify their camp with lines, palisadoes, and artillery. The earl of Shrewsbury remained in the neighbourhood of Bour∣deaux with six or seven thousand men, and wavered in his resolutions. He ar∣dently wished to relieve the place, but was apprehensive of finding it impracti∣cable, considering the strength of the French camp, and the superiority of their number. On the other hand, knowing that the count of Clermont was on his march, he thought there was a necessity for striking some desperate blow before the arrival of that general, otherwise he should never have an opportunity of acting with any prospect of success against their united efforts. This considera∣tion determined him to hazard an attack against the two officers employed in the siege of Castillon; and he forthwith began his march for this purpose. He at once defeated a body of four thousand men, commanded by Chabanes on the outside of the intrenchments; and, in spite of the cannon of the enemy, which destroyed the English in heaps, he charged the lines with such amazing impe∣tuosity, that they would certainly have been forced, had not a body of cavalry quitted the intrenchments at a different place, and fallen upon the rear of the English, who now found themselves surrounded on all hands, and exposed to the fire of a very numerous train of artillery. Shrewsbury, though over∣whelmed with old age, behaved with all the vigour and activity of youth; and his son the lord L'Isle approved himself worthy of such a valiant father: but all their efforts proved ineffectual; and the earl, seeing his defeat inevitable, scorned to outlive his disgrace. He conjured his son to retire while yet there was a possibility of escaping, that he might reserve his courage for the occasions of his country; but that gallant youth disdained the thoughts of leaving his fa∣ther in the power of his enemies, and declared that as they had fought, they should fall together. They accordingly rushed into the thickest of the battle; where the earl's horse being killed by a cannon-ball, he fell to the ground, and as he lay was transfixed by a bayonet, while the lord L'Isle lost his own life, in attempting to save that of his parent. The English were so discouraged by the fate of this renowned chief, that they betook themselves to flight, leaving twelve hundred of their fellow-soldiers dead on the field of battle; and the lord Molins, with about two hundred officers and soldiers, were taken prisoners. This defeat was attended with the surrender of Castillon, and the arrival of the count de Clermont with the rest of the army; then Charles, repairing to the camp, divided his forces into four different bodies, which at the same time in∣vested Cadillac, Libourne, Fronsac, and Bourdeaux. All these places were taken with very little difficulty, except the last, which held out till the seven∣teenth day of October, when the garrison capitulated, and were allowed to return to England. Thus the English were again expelled from Guienne; and of all the conquests made by Edward III. in France, nothing remained but the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. de C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>II.</NOTE> towns of Calais and Guisnes, which Charles was not yet able to reduce.</P>

<P>The clamour against the queen and ministry was encouraged by the friends and emissaries of Richard duke of York, who, far from thinking himself bound by the oath which had been extorted from him during his con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inement, persisted in his resolution to assert his pretensions to the crown, with the first convenient opportunity: but, as he did not think it would be politic to di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulge his real design, until he should have secured a majority in the council, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e resolved to renew his persecution against the duke of Somerset, who was either hated or envied by the whole nation: but even this aim he carefully con∣cealed at the present juncture. The parliament had been adjourned to Read∣ing, and af<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erwards to Westminster, for the fourteenth day of February, the king having suffered a dangerous relapse. In this interval, the secret friends of the duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> York, who still maintained the appearance of attachment to the court party, insinuated to the queen and Somerset, that, considering the present ferment of the nation, they had very little reason to expect the parliament would be agreeable to their views; that while the king enjoyed a good state of health, the orders issued in his name were supposed to be dictated according to his will and direction; but that, during the prevalence of his distemper, their adminis∣tration would want the sanction of his authority; and in all probability the par∣liament, in compliance with the sense of the nation, would appoint a new mi∣nistry. In order to prevent this misfortune, they observed that it would be ne∣cessary to admit into the council the duke of York, the earls of Salisbury and Warwick, and some other popular noblemen, to convince the public that they had no intention to govern by despotic authority. This advice appeared so plausible, that the queen and her favourite ran headlong into the snare; and
<PB N="361" REF="3710"/>
those noblemen were created members of the council before the meeting of par∣liament. They no sooner gained footing in this new station, than they super∣seded the credit of their adversaries, and even ventured to arrest the duke of Somerset in the queen's chamber. He was immediately committed prisoner to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Mean while the council expedited a commission to the duke, empowering him to hold the session as the king's representative; and the first days of that assembly were spent by the commons in preparing an impeach∣ment against Somerset, for the loss of Normandy by his misconduct. On the second day of April, the great seal was committed to the charge of the earl of Salisbury. Next day the parliament appointed the duke of York protector of the realm, defender of the church, and first counsellor of the king, during the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inority of Edward prince of Wales. York, being thus invested with the whole power of the administration, deprived his rival of the government of Calai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which he himself assumed by virtue of a commission in the name of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and every body believed that the impeachment of Somerset would b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> carried on with equal vigour and dispatch: but it dragged on to the end of the year, and was delayed, in all probability, for want of sufficient evidence.

The administration therefore returned into its former channel; and the duke of Somerset was discharged from his confinement.</P>

<P>As he had been committed by a simple order of council, he might have been enlarged by the same authority, had not the impeachment of the commons intervened, so that he was obliged to find security; and the duke of Buckingham, with the earl of Wiltshire and two knights, became his sureties; though they were afterwards discharged from their obligation, by a stretch of prerogative contrary to the laws of the kingdom. The duke of York and his partisans now lost all their influence in the council, which reverted to the queen and Somerset, by virtue of the king's recovery. Some noblemen, dreading the fatal consequences of an open rupture between the dukes of York and Somerset, interposed their good offices towards an accommodation. As it was the in∣terest of both to keep terms with the public, they agreed to refer their dispute to arbitration, and bound themselves to submit to the decision of the arbiters, in the penalty of twenty thousand marks, provided the sentence should be pro∣nounced by the twentieth day of June. While this affair was depending, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> duke of Somerset represented to the king, that, as he had been deprived of the government of Calais on a simple accusation, the particulars of which had never been proved, it was not just that his adversary should continue possessed of his spoils, before the difference between them should be determined. The king, upon this remonstrance, divested the duke of York of this command, though his commission had been made out for the term of seven years; and, on pre∣tence of observing a perfect neutrality between the two competitors, declared himself governor of Calais.</P>

The release of his rival from the Tower, so co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rary to law and the inclinations of the people, was a pretext which he hoped would engage the public in his interest; and this he used with all the suc∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he could have expected.

<P>York and his associates renewed their request, when they arrived on the twenty-second day of May in the neighbourhood of St. Alban's, but it was rejected with disdain; and they were threatened with the penalties of high treason. The earl of Warwick, who commanded the van-guard, was so ex∣asperated at this contemptuous treatment, that, without waiting for the duke's directions, he attacked the king's army so furiously, that it was soon thrown into confusion, notwithstanding all the efforts of Somerset. York, advancing in the mean time, charged them with equal impetuosity in flank; so that they were totally routed with the loss of five thousand men. The duke of Somer∣set, the earl of Northumberland, the earl of Str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fford, eldest son of the duke of Buckingham, the lord Clifford, and several officers of distinction, were slain upon the spot. The duke of Buckingham being wounded, retired from battle in the beginning of the engagement; and his retreat increased the disorder of the royalists. The king himself, having received an arrow in his neck, was abandoned by his army, and retired into a little house, where he was imme∣diately invested. But the duke of York and his confederates were no sooner in∣formed of his situation, than they ran thither, and falling on their knees before him, declared that the enemy of the public being now dead, they were entirely devoted to his service, and ready to obey his commands. The violence of Henry's fear was in some measure allayed by this declaration; and he begged, in the name of God, that they would put an end to the carnage. The duke immediately ordered a retreat to be sounded, and proclamation to be made for preventing the further effusion of blood.

<P>At their desire writs were issued for calling a parliament, which met on the ninth day of July, when Henry declared from the throne, that he looked upon York, Salisbury, and Warwick, as his faithful lieges; and their late conduct was justified by the authority of both houses. They decreed, that the nation had been misgoverned by the queen and the duke of Somerset, who had abused the goodness and confidence of his majesty; that the late duke of Glou∣cester

had been unjustly accused; that all alienations of estates belonging to the crown, which had been made since the first year of the king's reign, should be revoked; and that the mischief occasioned by the battle of St. Alban's should be imputed to Somerset and his adherents, who had concealed from his maje<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y the letter which would have prevented the engagement. The king was p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i∣tioned to nominate a protector, because his own indi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion hindered him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom managing the affairs of the public; and this address was seve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l times r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peated, without their receiving any answer from He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry.

Notwithstanding this opposition, he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1456.</NOTE> lived in such seeming security as astonished his enemies. He thought he should run too great a risk in pretending openly to the crown, which had re∣mained six and fifty years in the house of Lancaster; and therefore he waited for some favourable opportunity to broach his pretensions. His chief aim was to acquire the favour of the people, without which he foresaw all his efforts would prove ineffectual; and that they might see his conduct was not influenced by passion or interest, he left the king and queen at perfect liberty to act as they should think proper. He did not imagine it was in their power to divest him of the dignity of protector, which, according to his patent, could not be revoked but by the parliament: but the queen was too active and enterprizing, to be dete<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red from her purpose by such slender obstacles.</P>

<P>The king having recovered his health, the enemies of the duke resolved to seize t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is opportunity to deprive him of his protectorship. The parliament re-assembling, Henry appeared in person, and declared from the throne, that as he now enjoyed perfect health, and was in a condition to re∣sume the reins of government, he did not think the kingdom had any further occasion for a protector: he therefore desired the parliament would discharge the duke of York from the toils of that troublesome office. Whether the two houses thought the request reasonable, or the members had been tutored for the purpose, they readily complied with his desire; and he sent an order to the duke to abstain from the function of protector. York was not a little confounded at finding himself thus over-reached; but, making a virtue of necessity, he and his adherents submitted with a good grace to the orders of the king and parliament. But, on pretence of their having no further busi∣ness at court, they retired to Yorkshire, where they lived in the same neigh∣bourhood.
<PB N="364" REF="3740"/>
In a little time after they had withdrawn themselves, an insur∣rection happened in London, occasioned by a quarrel between an English and Italian merchant; and the duke of Buckingham and Exeter, being empowered to try and punish the delinquents, were prevented by the populace from exe∣cuting their commission. The queen suspecting that this tumult was excited by the partisans of the duke of York, and thinking the king's person wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe in London, conveyed him to Coventry, on pretence of his enjoying the benefit of a change of air; though her real design in taking this route, was that she might be nearer the discontented lords, who had retired from the council. She had received intelligence of their holding several successive meetings in the north; and she resolved to arrest them, if possible, in Co∣ventry, where they had fewer friends than in London. With this view she caused the king to write letters with his own hand, inviting them to court, where he had occasion for their advice and assistance in an affair of the ut∣most consequence. As the duke of York and his associates had taken n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> step towards publishing his design upon the crown, but covered all their con∣duct with the pretext of patriotism, they resolved to comply with the invita∣tion of Henry, who they imagined had at length opened his eyes with respect to the conduct of the queen and the ministry, and really desired their assistance, in order to reform the administration. They therefore set out for Coventry; but being apprized on the road of the queen's intentions, they suddenly changed their resolution, and separated immediately, in order to provide for their own safety. The duke of York ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tened to his estate of Wigmore, on the borders of Wales; the earl of Salisbury retired to his own house in Yorkshire; and Warwick took shipping immediately for Calais, of which place he had continued governor since the battle of St. Alban's.

<P>The mutual jealousy and machinations of the two parties were at this period interrupted by other considerations. As the English had for∣merly taken advantage of the divisions in France, to make conquests in that kingdom, Charles VII. resolved to follow the same maxims of policy, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1457.</NOTE> profit by the quarrels that began to divide England. He prepared two squa∣drons to attack the kingdom in different parts. One of these pillaged the town of Sandwich, and the other made a descent upon Cornwal: but, as they were very ill provided with necessaries, they did not undertake any en∣terprize of importance, and this was rather an insult than an invasion; for their troops reimbarked and returned to their own country, after having plun∣dered a few inconsiderable villages. In all probability the French court had engaged the Scots to co-operate with its measures against England, as they invaded the northern counties, notwithstanding the truce subsisting between the two nations, and carried off a considerable booty. The truces were so ill observed on both sides, that a predatory war was generally carried on without intermission between the borderers; and the mutual incu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sions of private adventurers furnished continual pretences for infringing the truce or accom∣modation. The English authors alledge that this invasion was headed by king James in person, who retired at the approach of the earl of Northumberland;
<PB N="365" REF="3750"/>
whereas the Scottish historians affirm that Piercy, and the earl of Douglas, at that time a refugee in England, entered Scotland and ravaged the country, until they were encountered and defeated by the earl of Angus and Sir James Hamilton: be that as it will, the truce between the two kingdoms was renewed, and afterwards prolonged for four years, though both kings had been greatly in∣censed, and written outrageous letters to each other. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>This dispute being happily terminated, Henry, who was of a mild, pacific disposition, and dreaded nothing so much as the revival of do∣mestic troubles, pressed his queen to listen to terms of accommodation, to which she did not appear averse; nor indeed was it her interest to prosecute a quarrel with such powerful antagonists, at a juncture when her administration was so odious to the people. On the other hand, York and his confederates did not think their scheme ripe for an open revolt against the established king, who, though a prince of mean capacity, had, by the innocence of his life, and the piety of his devotion, acquired, if not the esteem, at least the good will of his subjects. They, therefore, lent a willing ear to the overtures of peace and reconciliation, which were made in the king's name, by the archbishop of Canterbury and other prelates; and both parties agreed to meet at London<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1458.</NOTE> in January, that all disputes might be agreeably determined. Not but that the queen and York mutually distrusted each other's sincerity; and, upon the duke's signifying his suspicion, the king consented to his coming with his friends in a posture of defence. Salisbury arrived at the time and place ap∣pointed, with a retinue of five hundred men; York repaired to the congress with four hundred followers, and took up his quarters at Baynard's castle, while Salisbury resided at Cold-harbour; on the fourteenth day of February, Warwick landed from Calais with six hundred men, and chose the Grey∣friars for the place of his residence; the rest of the party lodged within the city. Somerset, Exeter, Northumberland, Egremond, and Clifford, came with nume∣rous retinues, who were quartered in the suburbs; and the mayor of London, at the head of five thousand men, kept guard within the city, and patroled through the streets, to maintain the public tranquillity. The conferences were begun; and, after some dispute, the warmth of which was moderated by the mediat∣ing bishops, the treaty was concluded to their mutual satisfaction. Some masses were founded for the souls of the people killed at St. Alban's, and a pecuniary satisfaction made to their heirs: both parties solemnly promised to lay aside their animosity, and live together in perfect friendship for the future; and the duke of York with his associates were re-admitted into the council. The fifth day of April was appointed for a thanksgiving, and a solemn pro∣cession to St. Paul's church. The king, queen, and all the noblemen, assisted on this occasion: those of different parties walked hand in hand, in token of amity, and the duke of York handed the queen, who affected to treat him with public marks of esteem and confidence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.

<P>Nevertheless, there was little sincerity on either side. The duke of York and his friends still dreaded some deceit or perfidy on the part of Margaret, who had formerly endeavoured to entrap them; and they quit∣ted the court on various pretences. The duke and the earl of Salisbury re∣paired to York, and the earl of Warwick returned to his government of Ca∣lais. In his passage he fell in with some ships belonging to Genoa and Lubec,
<PB N="366" REF="3760"/>
and a quarrel en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in consequence of their r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>using <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o pay proper de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣rence to the English flag, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sunk some of the number, and carried the rest into Calais. The republics complained to the king of this outrage; his ma∣jesty appointed commissioners to enquire into the particulars, and Warwick was obliged to come over and justify his conduct. During his stay at Lon∣don on this account, he occasionally assisted at council; and a domestic be∣longing to his train happening to quarrel one day with a servant of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng, who was wounded in the fray, all the retainers at court took to their arms, to revenge the insult offered to their companion. The delinquent having made his escape, they attacked the earl himself as he came from council; so that it was not without the greatest difficulty that he reached his boat, which waited for him on the side of the river, and which conveyed him to the city, after he had seen some of his followers killed in his defence. He forthwith conjectured that the queen had contrived this scheme for his de∣struction; and this conjecture was confirmed that same day, when he under∣stood that the king had granted a warrant to commit him prisoner to the Tower. He received this intelligence in time enough to elude the order; and retired to his father the earl of Salisbury, to consult about measures to be taken against the queen, upon whose promises, oaths, and engagements, they would place no dependance. The father and son agreed in opinion, that this last at∣tack was a snare laid by Margaret for the life of Warwick; and that as this nobleman was the idol of the soldiery, they should make it a pretence for decla∣ring open war against the queen and her adherents. In these sentiments they visited the duke of York, who adopted their ideas on this subject; and they concerted their measures accordingly. Warwick returned immediately to Calais, in order to secure that fortress, while York began to levy forces in Wales, while Salisbury assembled five or six thousand men, with which he in∣tended to advance to London, and demand satisfaction for the outrage com∣mitted against his son Warwick.</P>

<P>Mean while Margaret set out with the king on a progress into the counties of Warwick, Stafford, and Chester, in order to conciliate the affections of the people; and, by means of her artful behaviour and assumed affability, formed a strong association in behalf of herself and her son Edward. Under∣standing that the earl of Salisbury had raised a body of forces, and was on his march to join the duke of York in Here<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ordshire, she granted a commission<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He accordingly levied ten thousand men, with whom he advanced against Salisbury, who had proceeded as far as Bloreheath on the borders of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ordshire and Shropshire. Here the two armies came in sight of each other; and the earl, though his forces were not above half the number of the enemy, resolved to give them battle. They were parted by a rivulet; and on the twenty third day of September, Salisbury made a feint of retreating, as if he had been afraid of an attack.

<P>Salisbury, having thus opened his passage, marched into Wales, where he joined the duke of York, who was employed in raising an army for the pro∣secution of his design. The queen, in order to repair the damage she had sustained at Blor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heath, and oppose the progress of the malecontents, with whose motions she was perfectly well acquainted, exerted her endeavours with incredible activity, in assembling forces, and appointed the rendezvous at Coventry: while her enemies wrote to Warwick, desiring he would join them with some troops from Calais. On the receipt of his father's letter, he lost that fortress under the command of his uncle the lord Faloonbridge, and brought over part of the garrison, commanded by Sir Andrew Trollop, an officer of great reputation. The king's army being assembled, he began his march from Coventry towards Ludlow, where the rebels were encamped; and, halting at Gloucester, offered a pardon to the insurgents, provided they could lay down their arms. To this offer they replied, That they would not confide in such promises, which were no other than snares laid for their destruction; but that they were ready to submit to the king, provided he could find any security for the performance of his promise. Henry, having received this answer, super∣seded the earl of Warwick in the government of Calais, which he bestowed upon the duke of Somerset, and advanced to give battle to the malecontents. They wrote a letter to him, declaring that their sole view in taking up arms, was to defend themselves against the attempts of their enemies; that they had no intention to fight, unless forced to an engagement; that all they required, was a reformation of the abuses which had crept into the government, through the misconduct of the ministry; and they besought his majesty to look upon them as his faithful subjects, who had no design to the prejudice of his person, and wished for nothing so much as to be reinstated in his favour. The queen, imputing all this submission to fear, approached within half a mile of them in the evening, resolved to give battle next day, and in the mean time dispersed through the enemy's camp a proclamation, promising pardon to all those who should lay down their arms and submit. This expedient produced a surprising effect: the troops of the duke of York, supposing, from the king's making such an offer, that he had a great superiority of strength, and that there was no time to be lost, began to disperse instantaneously. Sir Andrew Trollop, who now for the first time perceived that the duke of York had a design upon the crown, deserted in the night, with the detachment he commanded; and his example was followed by such a number, that the lords, fearing they should be wholly abandoned, before day-break consulted their safety in flight. The duke of York, with his second son the earl of Rutland, retired to Wales, where they embarked for Ireland; and the earl of Warwick hastened over to Calais, whither he was soon followed by his father Salisbury, and York's eldest son, the earl of March, at that time in the nineteenth year of his age. The officers and soldiers, who remained after the retreat of their chiefs, submitted to the mercy of the king, who dismissed them in peace, after having caused some of them to be put to death for example.</P>

<P>The parliament, assembling in the month of December, declared the duke of York and his adherents guilty of high treason; their estates were con∣fiscated, and they and their descendants rendered incapable of succeeding to any inheritance, even to the fourth generation. As soon as the session broke
<PB N="368" REF="3780"/>
up, the duke of Somerset embarked with a body of troops in order to take pos∣session of Calais; but he met with such a reception as obliged him to land in another place, from which he marched to Guisnes, and there he sent out de∣tachments to skirmish with the garrison of Calais, by whom his men were generally repulsed to their quarters. Warwick was so beloved by the nation in general, that when Somerset landed with his troops, the sailors steered their ships directly into the harbour of Calais. The queen being determined to wrest the government of this fortress from the hands of her enemies, equipped a fleet for the assistance of Somerset, and ordered a considerable body of troops to be put on board, under the command of the lord Rivers, and his son Sir Anthony Wideville. While the fleet lay in the harbour of Sandwich, waiting for a fair wind, the earl of Warwick, having received intelligence of their de∣stination, manned the ships which had lately deserted to him, and embarking some troops, with Sir John Denham, they failed to Sandwich, where they surprized Rivers and all his officers, who were conveyed to Calais, together<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> with their ships; the sailors themselves favouring the enterprize. Warwick, being thus reinforced with shipping, sailed for Ireland, in order to consult the duke of York about the measures to be taken for another insurrection in Eng∣land, where the people espoused their cause, and their friends expected them<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The duke agreed with him in opinion that the lords at Calais should make a descent among their adherents and well-wishers in the county of Kent, and proceed directly to the capital, which they did not doubt would receive them with open arms. The earl of Warwick, in his return to Calais, fell in with the English fleet, commanded by the duke of Exeter, who had lately superseded him in the post of admiral, and been sent out to intercept him in his passage: but the sailors and soldiers on board of the duke's squa∣dron, refusing to fight against their old commander, he, in order to prevent a total revolt, sailed into Dartmouth, where the greater part of his men deserted for want of pay and provision.</P>

<P>The queen and the ministry did not doubt but the interview be∣tween the duke of York and the earl of Warwick would produce a new rebellion, which in order to weaken by anticipation, the council resolved to set on foot an exact inquisition in all the towns and counties of the kingdom, for the dis∣covery and punishment of all the partisans of the malecontents; the earl of Wiltshire and the lord Scales were vested with a commission to make this in∣quiry, and punish all those who had carried arms for York and his adherents in the late rebellion; and they began to execute their powers with great severity in some towns that openly favoured the lords of the opposition. Of all the coun∣ties in England Kent had the greatest cause to dread the resentment of the court, for it had always expressed a particular attachment to the duke of York; and the conduct of the inhabitants under Cade was not forgotten: believing therefore that their ruin was inevitable, if not prevented by some vigorous resolution, they sent an intimation to the lords at Calais, assuring them, that if they would land in Kent, the inhabitants would receive them with open arms, and hazard their lives and fortunes in their service. Sir Simon Montford had been detached by Mar∣garet with a body of fresh forces to guard Sandwich and other harbours that lay nearest the enemy; and ships had been equipped for convoying the duke of Somerset to England, where his presence was thought necessary by the council.
<PB N="369" REF="3790"/>
But Warwick surprized this armament, pillaged the town of Sandwich, took Montfort, and carried the ships to Calais. It was during this short expedition, that he became acquainted with the state of affairs in England; the knowledge of which, together with the invitation of the Kentish men, determined him and his associates to land without delay. Nothing was wanting but a sum of money to purchase necessaries; and the earl of Warwick borrowed on his own credit eighteen thousand pounds from the merchants of the staple. Thus sup∣plied, he began to make preparations, and in the mean time sent over his uncle, the lord Falconbridge, to Kent; where he was joined by a great number of people belonging to that and the adjacent counties. He was soon followed by Warwick himself, with the earls of March and Salisbury, who landed at Sandwich, where they were met by Thomas Bourchier, archbishop of Canter∣bury, the lord Cobham, and other persons of distinction. Before they set sail from Calais, they had dispersed a manifesto in England, assuring the nation that their sole motive for taking arms, was to deliver the people from the op∣pression under which they groaned, and to secure their liberties and privileges; towards the re-establishment of which they sollicited the assistance of all true∣hearted Englishmen. They had informed the duke of York of their intended operations, and the day on which they set sail for England. They brought over about fifteen hundred men, who being reinforced by four thousand, under the lord Cobham, they began their march towards London; and such numbers joined them in their route, that they entered the city in triumph with an army of forty<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Mean while the queen was not idle at Coventry: she had endeavoured to prevent their being received in London, by sending thither the lord Scales with a strong body of forces; but he was refused admittance by the mayor even before the arrival of the malecontents, and threw himself into the Tower, from whence he threatened to cannonade the city, should the magistrates admit the rebels: to these menaces however they paid no regard. Margaret still conti∣nued to assemble her forces, until her army being completed, she bestowed the joint command of it upon the dukes of Somerset and Buckingham, though she herself was in effect the general, and issued out all the orders in the name of Henry, who was there in person. As soon as the young earl of March under∣stood that she was advancing towards London, he left the earl of Salisbury with good part of his troops in that capital, and marched out with the earl of Warwick, at the head of five and twenty thousand men, to attack her before her army should be increased. The two parties met in the neighbourhood of Northampton; after the queen had passed a river by which they were divided. Before they proceeded to battle, the associated lords sent the bishop of Salisbury to the king, with a message, intreating his majesty would suspend his indignation, and join with them in some salutary measures to prevent the effusion of English blood. This address was looked upon as a meer ceremony to save appearances; and being rejected as such, both sides prepared for an engagement. On the nineteenth day of July the malecontents drew up their army in order of battle; the earl of Warwick commanded the right wing; the lord Cobham conducted the left; and the earl of March took his station in the center. The royal army was commanded by the dukes of Somerset and Buckingham; the queen remained at a little distance, from whence she could
<PB N="370" REF="3800"/>
observe the particulars of the action, and give her directions according to the emergency of the occasion; and Henry stayed in his tent, waiting the event of a battle on which the fate of his crown depended. The Yorkists, having published orders through their army to respect the king's person, and spare the common sol∣diers, but to give no quarter to the officers, proceeded to the attack about two o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clock in the afternoon; and the action beginning with equal fury on both sides, continued till seven in the evening; when the lord Grey of Ruthwin, who commanded a con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iderable part of Henry's army, suddenly revolted to the reb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.

The duke of Buckingham, the earl of Shrewsbury, son o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the famous Talbot, the lord Beaumont, and many other persons of di∣stinction, were killed upon the spot. The queen, the prince of Wales, and the duke of Somerset, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed with such precipitation, that they did not halt un∣til they had reached Durham. Henry fell into the hands of the victors, who tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed him with all the exterior respect due to their sovereign; and this defe∣rence, in some measure, consoled him for the mischance of the day, which would have rendered him a very great object of compassion, had not his natural indolence and want of sensibility fortified him against all the vici<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itudes of fortune. He was immediately conducted to Northampton, with all the marks of honour and regard; and, after a short stay in that place, repaired to London, surrounded by a crowd of noblemen and others, who had so lately appeared against him in the field of battle. Mean time the queen, who did<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.

Immediately after his arrival in London, the Tower surrendered for want of provisions; and the lord Scales, who acted as gover∣nor, attempting to go by water in disguise to the sanctuary at Westminster, was discovered and assassinated by the watermen. A commission was granted to the earl of Salisbury, impowering him to march with an army to the relief of Roxburgh castle, besieged by James II. of Scotland, who infringed the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce that he might take advantage of the intestine troubles of England.

The earl of War∣wick was confirmed in the government of Calais and Guisnes, by virtue of a new commission; and the duke of York and his adherents were declared good and faithful subjects.

who were then sitting. He stood for some time under the canopy with his hand upon the throne, waiting until he should be desired to ascend: but, the whole assembly maintained a profound silence; and, the archbishop of Canter∣bury advancing to him, asked, if he had waited upon the king since his arrival. He could not help blushing at this question; and after some pause, replied, that he did not know any person to whom he owed that respect. So saying, he retired to his own house; and next day sent a writing to the parliament, containing the reasons upon which his pretensions to the crown were founded. He pretended to mount the throne as heir to the house of March; desired, that he might be heard by his counsel; and, that the parliament would do him justice. It was not without some difficulty that the lords allowed his claim to be read in the house; but, they resolved to proceed no farther, without com∣municating the affair to his majesty. When Henry was informed of their re∣solution, he desired, that the claim might be considered by his judges, serjeants, and attorney. These being summoned, declined giving their opinions in a matter so far above their cognizance. Then the lords, after another debate, ordered the serjeants and attorney to come and defend the king's title: it was likewise resolved, that there should be an entire freedom of debate; and, that no lord should be called in question for what he should say in support of his own opinion.</P>

<P>We have already mentioned the pedigree of Richard duke of York, as descended from Lionel duke of Clarence, elder brother of John of Gaunt, the founder of the house of Lancaster; and, we shall now take notice of the objections that were made to Richard's claim. Henry's friends observed, that when his grandfather Henry IV. took possession of the throne, no person pre∣tended to dispute his title. The Yorkists replied, that as Edmund earl of March, who was then alive, could not assert his title without running the risque of his life, his silence could not be interpreted into acquiescence in the right of the usurper. When Henry's favourers alledged, that his grandfather had re∣ceived the crown by the authority of parliament, the favourers of the duke of York answered, that he did not pretend to claim it without the sanction of the said authority, as plainly appeared from his memorial presented to both houses; but, as the parliament had formerly strong reasons to set aside the true heir in favour of the house of Lancaster, so now they had powerful motives for doing justice to the duke of York. The resignation of Richard II. was advanced in behalf of the house of Lancaster, and, the other side denied that Richard's resignation regarded that house in particular, or even the person of Henry IV. but, even allowing this to have been the case, a king who was actually in confinement, and on the point of being deposed, had no power to establish a successor. It was objected to the duke of York, that his father, the earl of Cambridge, had been executed for high treason, and his posterity de∣clared incapable of all inheritance: but, this objection <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as obviated by those who observed, that the duke of York had been restored to the honours, and all the rights of succession by the king himself; and acknowledged as duke of York and earl of March by Henry, as well as the whole kingdom. Then the friends of the king observed, that the crown had been above sixty years in possession of the house of Lancaster. To this observation the others replied,
<PB N="372" REF="3820"/>
that natural rights were indefeasible, and that no positive law could bring them into prescription. The last argument advanced in favour of Henry imported, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at having already reigned t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irty years, and led an innocent and inoffensive <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fe, it would be cruel to deprive him of the crown. To invalidate this argu∣ment, the Yorkists observed, that as Henry was incapable of governing by himself, such indulgence would only operate in favour of the queen and her ministers, who ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed his name and authority: that, out of tenderness to him, they ought not to prejudice the whole kingdom, nor commit a flagrant piece of injustice from a motive of charity.</P>
<P N="55">LV. Such were the principal reasons advanced on both sides of this very remarkable dispute, which was maintained with great spirit and capacity for some days successively, until they agreed to a sort of modification, which they hoped would prevent all those mischievous consequences that might have at∣tended a total revolution. They unanimously resolved, that Henry should en∣joy the crown for his natural life; and the duke of York be declared his successor. This resolution was signified to the king by the chancellor, and afterwards reduced to an act of parliament to the following effect: That, altho' the duke of York had an incontestible right to the throne, he consented to Henry's enjoying it for life, and even to take the oath to him as to his lawful sovereign; but, in case Henry should in any shape violate this<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owe.

After this act was passed, the king, with the crown upon his head, went in procession to St. Paul's, accompanied by the duke of York, in token of reconciliation; and, indeed, he seemed to be quite easy under this revolution of his affairs. Without seeming affected by the misfortunes of his family, he lived in tranquillity, employing himself wholly in the exercises of de∣votion; and leaving the administration to those who managed under the sanction of his name and authority. The duke of York finding himself absolutely master of Henry's person, obliged him to sign an order for the queen to repair to London; well knowing, that she would not obey the injunction: but, his de∣sign was to render her criminal in the eyes of the world, from her refusal to comply with the command of her lord and husband; which would in some measure authorise the measures he intended to take against that princess. He thought her absolutely without resource, and persuaded himself, that nothing was wanting but a pretext for raising invincible obstacles to her return, that he might be altogether delivered from such an active enemy. But, he was mi∣staken in his conjecture.</P>

<P>Margaret, far from being dispirited by the misfortunes of her husband, had already returned to England with her son the prince of Wales; and raised an army of eighteen thousand men in the northern counties. In order to engage the people of that country in her interest, she found means to diffuse a report among them, that they should be allowed to pillage all Eng∣land to the southward of the Trent; and, in all probability, her success in le∣vying forces was owing to this expedient. The duke of York, being in∣formed of her designs, resolved to arrest her in the middle of her career; and for that purpose set out from London with four or five thousand men, leaving an order with his son the earl of March, to conduct the rest of the army into
<PB N="373" REF="3830"/>
quarters of refreshment in Wales; and afterwards join him in the northern coun∣ties. As the duke advanced towards the north, he was not a little alarmed by the news of the queen's success in levying forces, with which he had not been acquainted before he left London; and, when he arrived in the neigh∣bourhood of Wakefield in Yorkshire, he received intelligence, that she was in full march against him, at the head of eighteen thousand men. He forthwith threw himself into his own castle of Sandal, by the advice of the earl of Salis∣bury, who observed, that as the queen had no artillery, he could not be forced in that place, until he should be joined by his son Edward. Margaret, ne∣glected no artifice which she thought could induce him to quit this retreat before his son's arrival. She affected to continue her route towards the south; then she placed the greater part of her forces behind an eminence; and with the rest approaching the castle of Sandal, provoked him to battle by the most insulting messages. Whether the duke was stimulated by her reproaches, or found himself obliged to make a desperate effort, for want of provision; or lastly, was deceived in the number of the enemy; certain it is, he drew out his men, and resolved to hazard a battle. The action was begun by York, who charged the queen's troops with great impetuosity: but, her numbers overballanced his courage; and those troops who had been posted in ambush behind the hill, falling suddenly upon his rear, the Yorkists were immediately routed: the duke himself was slain fighting valiantly on foot; Sir Thomas Harrington, Sir David Hall, Sir Hugh Hastings, Sir Thomas Nevil, third son to the earl of Salisbury, Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, with many other gentlemen, and about two thousand eight hundred soldiers, met with the same fate. The duke's son Edmund Plantagenet, earl of Rutland, was after the battle inhumanly killed in cold blood, upon Wakefield bridge, by the lord Clifford: the earl of Salisbury being wounded and taken prisoner, was sent to Pomfret, where he suffered decapitation, and his head was fixed on the walls of York, as well as the duke's, upon which Clifford set a crown of paper, in de∣rision of his title. Thus fell Richard, duke of York, a prince possessed of many great and amiable qualities, and blameworthy alone, for having involved his country in the miseries of civil war, with a view to assert a disputed claim, such as had often been disregarded in the succession of the English kings, both before and after the conquest; a claim which, in all probability, would have lain dormant, had not the imbecility of Henry, and the arbitrary measures and unpopular deportment of his queen, awaked and invited it from the shade of oblivion.</P>

<P>The battle of Wakefield, which was fought on the thirtieth day of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.Ch. 1461.</NOTE> December, instead of re-establishing the affairs of Margaret, and the prince of Wales, served only to hasten their ruin. The earl of March, far from being dispirited by the defeat and death of his father, was inflamed with the most eager desire of revenge; and resolved to hazard his life and fortune in the sup∣port of his pretensions. He now found himself in Wales, at the head of three and twenty thousand men, besides those who had been left under the command of Warwick for the defence of the capital; and, with these he determined to go in quest of Margaret, on whom he longed to revenge the misfortunes of his family. That princess had begun her march for London; and hearing of
<PB N="374" REF="3840"/>
young Edward's design, detached Gaspar Tudor, earl of Pembroke, and James Butler earl of Ormond, with a body of English and Irish troops, to oppose his progress. March, being informed of the queen's motions, had altered his first resolution of giving her battle, and changed his route, in hope of reaching London before her arrival: but, when he understood, that Tudor had been detached against him, rather than run the risque of being hemmed in between two hostile armies, he marched directly into Herefordshire, in order to give him battle. The two armies met near Mortimer's cross, on Candlemas eve; and Edward being greatly superior in number to the Lancastrians, these last were soon defeated, with the loss of three thousand and eight hundred men killed on the field of action. The earls of Pembroke and Ormond escaped; but, Owen Tudor, husband of Catherine of France, and father-in-law to king Henry, was<NOTE PLACE="marg">G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>afton.

<P>Mean while the queen, with her son, attended by the dukes of So∣merset and Exeter, the earls of Northumberland, Devonshire, and Shrewsbury, the lords Fitzhugh, Grey of Codemore, Roos, Greystock, Willes, and Wil∣loughby, continued her march towards London, in full hope, that whenever her victorious army should appear, the citizens would expel the earl of War∣wick, and receive her in triumph. Warwick himself seemed to dread some such event; for, rather than keep himself secure within the walls of London, he marched out with an handful to hazard an engagement: a step which he certainly would not have taken, had he been secure in the affection of the ci∣tizens. Margaret had advanced as far as St. Alban's, when she received intel∣ligence, that Warwick was on his march towards that place, with the king in his army, which was reinforced by a body of Londoners. These had joined him, in order to prevent the mischiess they apprehended from the queen's troops, who were northern free-booters accustomed to rapine, and had ravaged the whole country in their passage. On Shrove-Tuesday the oppposite armies came in sight of each other, and engaged on Barnard's-Heath near St. Alban's; where, for some time, the fortune of Warwick seemed to prevail, until the lord Lovelace, who commanded one of his wings, wheeled off, leaving the main body exposed; and then victory declared for Margaret. The earl on this oc∣casion lost two thousand men, who were killed either in the action or in the pursuit; tho' he rallied his broken troops, and made an excellent retreat. The lord Bonvil, and Sir Thomas Kyreil, to whose care he had committed the person of Henry, were persuaded to stay with that prince, on his assurance, that they should receive no injury; but, he had not interest enough to save their lives: Margaret ordered them to be beheaded at St. Alban's on Ash-Wed∣nesday. The chief advantage which Margaret reaped from the victory, was the release of her husband, whose name served to authorise her transactions: but, she seems to have been very much wanting to her own interest, in neglecting to march directly to the capital, while the news of her victory operated so strongly on the minds of the inhabitants, that they would have opened their gates at her approach. The citizens, indeed, were afraid of being plun∣dered by her forces, who had already pillaged the town of St. Alban's: but, they were still more afraid of incurring the resentment of a victorious army, which they did not think themselves in a condition to oppose. The ravages of
<PB N="375" REF="3850"/>
he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> troops having occasioned a scarcity of provision in her camp, she demanded a supply <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the mayor of London, who did not think proper to refuse her in such a conjuncture. He ordered several waggons to be loaded with all sorts of lenten provision; but, they were stopped at Newgate by the populace, who were incensed at the licentious behaviour of her troops; and declared, that no necessaries should be furnished by the city, for the use of an army that did not come to defend, but to pillage their effects. The queen sent a body of forces, commanded by Sir Baldwin Fulford, and Sir Alexander Hody, to make an effort towards gaining admittance to the city, and they attempted to force Cripplegate; but were repulsed. Margaret denounced vengeance against the Londoners for this insult; tho' she never had an opportunity to execute the scheme of her resentment; for, receiving intelligence that the earls of March and Warwick had joined their forces at Chiping-Norton in Oxfordshire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grafton.</NOTE> and begun their progress for London, she retired to the north, where she hoped to increase her army to such a formidable number, as would insure suc∣cess against all opposition.</P>

<P>The earl of March arriving at London in the beginning of March, entered the city in triumph, amidst the acclamations of the people, by whom he was adored, for his affability and personal accomplishments, in which he excelled all the princes of his age. His friends, trusting to this popularity, resolved to save him the trouble and uncertainty of a parliamentary decision, and raise him at once to the throne by the consent of the people, and the grandees. With this view, the earl of Warwick drew up his army in order of battle, in the fields near Clerkenwell, on pretence of exercising the soldiers: an immense multitude of people being assembled to indulge their curiosity, the earl rode into the midst of this concourse, and read aloud the convention made between Henry and the duke of York, and confirmed by act of parlia∣ment. Then he gave them to understand, that as the king had notoriously violated this agreement, he had indisputably forfeited his right to the crown, which now belonged to Edward Plantagenet, the sole and true heir of the house of Mortimer. He thus prepared the people for his purpose, by an assertion which was absolutely false, inasmuch as Henry had been his own prisoner from the time of the agreement till the battle of Barnet, after which he was com∣pelled to act according to the views of Margaret. Then he raised his voice, and asked, if they would have Henry of Lancaster for their king: the whole multitude answered, No, No: but when he demanded, if they would acknow∣ledge Edward for their sovereign, they replied in the affirmative with loud ac∣clamations. The consent of the people being thus obtained, the Yorkists convoked a great council of all the lords spiritual and temporal, magistrates, and gentlemen, who happened to be in London; and, Edward having ex∣plained his right to the crown, both by birth, and the agreement between Henry and his father, d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sired it might be adjudged to him by the determina∣tion of this assembly. He must have had more courage than discretion, who would have attempted to impugn his pretensions at such a juncture; therefore, the council unanimously declared, that Henry of Lancaster had forfeited all right to the crown, in violating the solemn agreement made with the late duke of York, which was confirmed by parliament; and, that it now devolved to
<PB N="37$" REF="3860"/>
the duke's eldest son, Edward Plantagenet earl of March. After this decla∣ration, the crown was offered to the earl, who received it with a modest ac∣knowledgment of his own insufficiency; adding, that tho' his youth and in∣experience rendered him fearful of loading himself with such a heavy burthen, he would do his utmost endeavours, with God's assistance, to make his people rich and happy. Next day he repaired to St. Paul's church, where he sat in the royal chair, with the sceptre of St. Edward in his hand. The archbishop of Canterbury demanding aloud, if the people would own Edward, earl of M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rch, as their king, they replied as before, with acclamations of joy; and then the king received the homage of the nobility. This ceremony being con∣cluded with a solemn Te Deum, Edward was conducted to the bishop's palace, in which the kings used to reside; and, on the fifth day of March, he was pro∣claimed by the name of Edward IV. in the city of London, and the neigh∣bourhood.</P>

<P>THE first act of fovere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnty that distinguished the reign of Edward, is said to have been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he execution of one Walker, a citizen and grocer, who jocosely said to his neighbours that he would make his son heir to the crown, meaning the sign of the crown that hung over his door: this innocent jest was construed into high treason, and the unhappy man suffered death; though, in all probability, his chief crime was his adherence to the house of Lancaster, which Edward resolved to p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nish with the utmost rigour. He had not e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joyed his new dign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty above eight days, when he found himself obliged to begin his march against Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>garet, who had suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eded so well in recruiting her army amo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g her northern friends, that by this time she found herself at the head of sixty thousand men, ready to sacrifice their lives for her service. Edward did not so much depend upon his election, which had been extremely irregular and defective, as upon the strength of his faction, and the success of his arms. Replete with all the fire of youth, courage, and ambi∣tion, he confided in his va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our and fort<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, against all odds of opposition; and, putting himself at the head of his forces, set out for the north, in hope of striking a decisive stroke against the queen and her adherents.</P>

<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>On his arrival at Pontefract, he detached the lord Fitzwalter to sieze the pass of Ferryb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dge, on the river Aire; and this service he performed without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pposition. Heary and his queen hearing of Edward's approach, bestowed the command of their army on the duke of Somerset, while they themselves remained at York, waiting the issue of an engagement, by which their fate was likely to be decided for ever. Some<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>set being informed that Fitzwalter had s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>zed the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rybridge, concluded that Edward's design was to give him battle; and that he might attack him with less advantage, he re∣solved to repel the troops of Fitzwalter to the other side of the river. For this purpose he sent a detachment under lord Clifford, who surprized the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and drove them from the pass with great slaughter, after an obsti∣nate action, in which Fitzwalter and the Bastard of Salisbury lost their lives. The earl of Warwick was extremely alarmed at the news of this disaster, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch he no sooner received than he rode full speed to Edward, and commu∣nicated
<PB N="379" REF="3890"/>
the tidings with marks of uncommon emotion; but, to convince his sovereign that his confusion did not proceed from any fear of his own perso∣nal danger, he killed his horse on the spot, and kissing the hilt of his sword, which was made in the form of a cross, swore that even if the whole army should forsake the king, he would remain alone, and spend the la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t drop of his blood in defence of his majesty. Edward, far from being dispirited by this check, which seemed to disorder Warwick so much, ordered proclam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion to be made in his army, that all persons who were afraid of staying should have free leave to retire: That he would reward those who should do their duty; but that he would shew no mercy to any person who should fly from the battl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Then he ordered lord Falconbridge to pass the Aire at Castleford, about a league above Ferrybridge, and retake the post which the enemy had won. This order was executed with such diligence and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, that the deta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hment had crossed the river before the Lancastrians had the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t intimation of their design; then attacking Clifford by surprize, that nobleman and the brother of the earl of Westmoreland were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain, and their forces intirely routed.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>The pass of Ferrybridge being thus regained, Edward crossed the river, and, early in the morning of Palm-sunday, advanced towards the Lan∣castrians, who, to the number of sixty thousand, occupied the fields between Towton and Saxton. Though the Yorkists did not exceed nine and forty thousand, they were chosen men, and Edward did not entertain the least doubt of victory, but, before the battle joined, he published an o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der through his army, that his soldiers should not encumber themselves with prisoners. About nine in the morning it began to snow, and a sharp wind drove the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet full into the faces of the Lancastrians, disordering their sight in such a manner, that they could not judge the distance between themselves and the enemy. The lord Falconbridge, who commanded the van of Edward's army, taking ad∣vantage of this accident, ordered his archers to advance within sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Henry's line, and let fly a shower of arrows, which were no sooner discharged than they retired again to their former station. The Lancastrian<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> feeling the effect<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this flight, believed the Yorkists were within their reach, and plied their bows until their quiver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were quite exhausted, without having done the least execution. Then Falconbridge advanced again with his archers, who now shot their arrows without opposition, and slew a vast number of the enemy, even with the shafts which they picked from the field, after their own quivers were emptied. The earl of Northumberland and Sir Andrew Trollop, who commanded the van of Henry's army, seeing the disadvantage under which they laboured, in this way of fighting, advanced to close combat, and each side fought with equal courage, obstinacy, and rancour. The battle raged with great fury from morning till night; and Edward exhibited such proofs of surprizing courage, activity, and conduct, that the fate of the day depended in a great measure on his personal behaviour, and that of the earl of Warwick. Towards the evening, the Lancastrians being discouraged by the death of the earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, the lords Dacres and Willes, Sir Andrew Trollop, and many other officers of distinction, began to give ground, though not in great disorder, intending to retreat to the bridge of Tadcaster. They accordingly preserved their ranks, and wheeled about occasionally as they retired, until Edward and Warwick animating their men to render the
<PB N="380" REF="3900"/>
action decisive, they redoubled their efforts, and charged with such impetuosity, that the Lancastrians were broken and entirely routed. Great numbers were slain in the field of battle and in the pursuit; but the chief carnage happened at the small river Coc, which disembogues itself into the Warf. Thither the fugitives f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in hope of fording the stream; but it was so swelled with the rains as to be rendered impassable, until a kind of bridge or mound was formed by the dead bodies of the Lancastrians, who were slaughtered on the banks or drowned in the river, which ran purple with their blood. Nor will this circumstance appear incredible, when we consider that above six and thirty thousand men were killed in this battle. The dukes of Somerset and Exeter escaped with great difficulty; but the earl of Devonshire was taken.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.

This, however, she purchased at a dear rate, in ceding the town and castle of Berwick to the Scottish monarch, who was at that time a minor, under the tuition of George Douglas earl of Angus, with whom Henry engaged in a particular convention. Edward, on his arrival at York, ordered the heads of his father and the earl of Salisbury to be taken down from the walls, and those of the earl of Devonshire and some others, who were beheaded as traitors, to be set up in their room.</P>

<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>The battle of Towton intirely decided the fate of the house of Lan∣caster. The north, which used to supply it with forces, was now exhausted, and the brave<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t warriors of those parts had perished in such a series of engage∣ments. The queen had no resource left but the friendship of Scotland, from which she could expect but little a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance during the minority of James III. Edward was master of all England and Wales, except Harlegh and Mer∣ionethshire, and some ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tles in Northumberland, which he did not think it necessary to reduce. Perhaps he was afraid of their being delivered to the Scots, should they be hard pressed by his forces; or imagined they would submit of their own accord, upon his title's being universally acknowledged in all other parts of the kingdom, and confirmed by the ceremony of his co∣ronation, which he would no longer defer. He had proceeded as far as New∣castle, where having made some necessary regulations for preserving the peace of the country, and left a body of troops sufficient to repel the incursions that might be made from those castles that did not yet acknowledge his sovereignty, he returned to his palace of She<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, in the neighbourhood of London. The twentieth day of June was fixed for his coronation; and, in the mean time, by the advice of the earl of Douglas, who had been long a refugee in England, he resolved to find such employment for the Scots as would prevent them from giving any considerable assistance to Henry and Margaret. For this purpose he entered into a negotiation with the earl of Ross, lord of the Isles, who had revolted from James, and promised to waste the northern parts of Scotland with fire and sword: but, as the articles of this treaty, which was managed by the earl of Douglas, could not be executed immediately, Edward proposed a truce to the regency of Scotland, and commissioners were appointed to treat
<PB N="381" REF="3910"/>
on this subject; but the conferences were rendered ineffectual by the intrigues of Margaret, who resided at Edinburgh, and by this time had ingratiated herself with Mary of Gueldres, the Scottish king's mother.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>Mean while the new king of England was crowned at Westminster, and issued out writs for calling a parliament to meet on the sixth day of July, from which it was prorogued to the fourth day of November. Immediately after the session was opened, the commons attended Edward with an address, congratulating him on his accession to the throne, and requesting him to punish all persons guilty of such extortions, riots, rapes, murders, and other iniquities, as had been committed with impunity, during the preceding<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reign. Then an act was passed, confirming the title of Edward. All those which had been made against the house of York were repealed. Henry VI. after a reign of eight and thirty years, was declared an usurper, and all his transac∣tions were annulled as illegal; and lastly, he himself, his queen, and all their adherents, were attainted as traitors. During this session, Edward created his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Rot. Parl.</NOTE> brother George duke of Clarence; his younger brother Richard was made duke of Gloucester; the lord Falconbridge promoted to the earldom of Kent; Henry Bourchier the king's uncle, was honoured with the earldom of Essex; and John Nevil, brother to the earl of Warwick, was created baron of Mon∣tague. These promotions were followed by severities which serve to evince that cruelty which was inherent in all, even the most accomplished princes of the Norman line. Besides Henry himself, his wife Margaret, and their son Edward, who were attainted, the same act included the dukes of Somerset and Exeter, the earls of Northumberland, Wilts, and Pembroke, the viscount Beaumont, the lords Roos, Nevil, Willes, Clifford, Grey of Rugemont, Dacres, and Hungerford, Sir Richard Tonstall, and a great number of gentle∣men whose estates were confiscated. John earl of Oxford, a venerable old<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The lands and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian.</NOTE> effects of those victims he distributed among his own adherents, and conciliated the affection of the clergy by confirming their privileges, exempting them from being prosecuted in civil courts for felonies and other offences; establish∣ing the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts with regard to tythes, and al∣lowing them to issue spiritual censures against such as should invade their pre∣rogatives. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Edward having regulated his domestic affairs, converted his attention to foreign occurrences. England was actually at war with France, Scotland, Brittany, and the Low Countries; and if all these powers had joined against Edward at this juncture, his royalty would have been of short duration. Luckily for him, he had nothing to fear from Lewis XI. of France, whose mind was wholly engrossed by a project for rendering himself absolute in his own dominions, and destroying the power of the nobles, of whom the dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne were the principal. He therefore had no inclina∣tion to renew the war with England. The duke of Brittany was in no condition to cope with such a powerful kingdom. The duke of Burgundy, though
<PB N="$82" REF="3920"/>
a friend to the house of Lancaster, was so well acquainted with the disposition of Lewis, that he divined his scheme; and desired to live in peace with Eng∣land, that he might be the more able to anticipace the French king's designs. In these sentiments, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sent ambassadors to congratulate Edward on his ac∣cession to the throne; and to complain of some infractions of the truce sub∣sisting between England and the Low Countries. They met with a very favourable reception, and commissioners were appointed to examine the parti∣culars of the complaint, that all differences might be amicably compromised. Scotland then was the only place from whence he could apprehend the least molestation. Margaret had concluded a contract of marriage between her son Edward, and the sister of James, though both parties were insants; and leaving her husband at Edinburgh, made a voyage to France to crave the as∣sistance of Lewis: but that prince was not of a character to engage in any enterprize from which he saw no prospect of advantage. He courteously re∣ceived Margaret, who was his near relation, and even amused her with pro∣mise of succour; but all she could obtain was a present of twenty thousand li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res, and a declaration that all the adherents of the house of Lancaster should meet with a friendly reception in his dominions. Edward, in order to baffle her intrigues in Scotland, still employed Douglas in a negotiation with John lord of the Isles, who had lately succeeded his father. The bishop of Dur∣ham, the earl of Worcester, and some others, were empowered to finish the treaty, which was concluded on the following conditions: That John earl of Ross, lord of the isles, Donald Ballach his brother, and John the son of Do∣nald, should do homage to king Edward: That they should never acknowledge any other king of England but Edward, or his successors, descended from Lionel duke of Clarence: That they should be ready to serve him in all his wars against the Scots in Britain and Ireland: That, in time of peace, the earl of Ross should enjoy a yearly pension of one hundred pounds sterling, forty be allowed to Donald, and ten to John the son of Donald; and that these pensions should be doubled in time of war or actual service: That in case Scotland should be conquered by the arms of Edward, he should invest them with the property of all the isles situated to the northward of the Scottish sea: That James earl of Douglas should in like manner receive the investiture of all the lands he had formerly possessed in Scotland, from the north sea to the borders of England; and that Edward should make neither peace nor truce<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> with Scotland, without comprehending them in the treaty.</P>

<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>Edward had intimated his elevation to pope Pius II. who now think∣ing him sufficiently established on the throne, addressed him in a brief, con∣gratulating him upon his accession; but couched in such a manner as reserved to himself the liberty of unsaying his compliment, in case the king should ex∣perience a vissicitude of fortune; for his approbation was conditional, and founded upon the proofs which Edward himself advanced in behalf of his pre∣tensions. The lord Falconbridge, lately created earl of Kent, was now pro∣moted to the post of high admiral of England; and the kingdom enjoying profound tranquillity, after the storm by which it had been agitated, the duke of Somerset, and Ralph Piercy, brother to the earl of Northumberland, im∣plored<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Public.</NOTE> the mercy of the king, by whom they were generously pardoned. This calm was not of long duration. Margaret having obtained a small reinforce∣ment

Montague, encouraged by this success, resolved to have the whole honour of defeating Margaret before the king should come up, and marching directly to He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ham, where her army was intrenched, he attacked them in their lines before they had intimation of his approach, and obtained a complete victory. The duke of So∣merset was taken prisoner, together with the lords Roos and Hunger<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord; but Henry, his queen, and son, escaped into Scotland, though they were so hotly pursued, that some of Henry's attendants were taken almost by his s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de; and among these the person who carried his cap of state, which was deli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered to Edward.

punished as traitors: but De Brezé, who commanded the garrison of Alnewick, composed of French troops, defended himself with great gallantry, until he and his men were brought off by the earl of Angus, at the head of a strong body of Scottish cavalry. Edward's last victory cooled that friendship which the French and Scots had hitherto manifested for the unfortunate Henry, whose affairs they now looked upon as desperate. The Scots perceiving the precautions which were taken by Montague, whom the king of England had just declared warden of the Marches, saw no prospect of eluding his vigilance by incursions, and desired that Edward would grant safe-conducts for ambassa∣dors to come and treat of a pacification: at the same time Lewis XI. negotiated a truce with him for one year, by the mediation of the duke of Burgundy, who likewise renewed the truce of commerce between England and the Low Coun∣tries. Mean while the archbishop of St. Andrew's repairing to London as envoy from the regency of Scotland, concluded a like truce between the two king∣doms, on condition that the respective kings should not in any shape counte∣nance<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Pub.</NOTE> or assist the enemies of each other.</P>

<P>Henry being thus abandoned by all his allies, and thinking his person unsafe at Edinburgh since the conclusion of this last agreement, took the im∣prudent resolution of repairing privately to England, where perhaps he hoped the northern counties would again rise in his favour. He accordingly set out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom Edinburgh, in disguise, attended by three divines, and reached Wadding∣ton-Hall in Lancashire, where, after he had lain concealed for some time, he was discovered by Sir James Harrington, who treated this unfortunate prince with the utmost indignity. He was seized as he sat at dinner, and being placed upon a horse, his legs were tied under the belly of the beast, as if he had been the vilest malefactor. In this manner he was conducted to London, and being met upon the road by the earl of Warwick, that nobleman insulted him in the most opprobrious terms, even encouraging the multitude to deride the unfortunate monarch. After the capture of Henry, his queen and son, afraid of trusting to any person's fidelity, fled for refuge into woods and deserts, where they suffered all the extremity of distress, till at length they were rifled by rob∣bers, who would, in all probability, have deprived them of their lives as well as of their apparel and effects, had not the thieves quarrelled about the booty, and attacking one another, afforded an oppertunity for the royal prisoners to make their escape. They had not proceeded far when they were met by another ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ian, who approached them with a drawn sword in his hand and fury in his aspect. On this occasion, Margaret exhibited a remarkable proof of presence of mind and resolution. Taking her son by the hand, and assuming an air of confidence and majesty, "Here, friend," said she, "save my son, the son of good king "Henry." The robber was struck with the dignity and beauty of her person, as well as with the nature of her address. He happened to be one of those who had been outlawed for adhering to the cause of her husband. His savage heart was melted with compassion, at sight of his queen and prince in such deplora∣ble distress. He comforted them with assurances of fidelity and protection; and carefully conducted them to a village near the sea-side, where they found an opportunity of embarking in a vessel for Flanders. They were hospitably received by the duke of Burgundy, from whose court they repaired to that of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>let.</NOTE> Margaret's father René of Anjou. About the same time Edmund duke of

Somerset, brother of him who was beheaded at Hexham, and the duke of Exeter, escaped to the Low Countries, where they concealed their quality, in apprehension of being delivered into the hands of Edward; and were reduced to such extremity of wretchedness, that even in the severest time of winter, they ran about barefoot as errand boys to the lowest class of people, till at length they were discovered and accommodated by the duke of Burgundy, with mode∣rate<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip de Co∣mines.</NOTE> pensions for their subsistence.</P>

<P>Edward having Henry in his power, and Margaret having quitted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1464.</NOTE> the kingdom, there was no other person capable of disturbing his tranquility. He therefore seized this opportunity of acquiring the affection of his subjects, who had been alarmed and disgusted by his late acts of severity. He had pub∣lished a general amnesty in favour of all the Lancastrians who, within a certain specified time, should submit to his government, and take the oath of alle∣giance. He exerted all his talents in efforts to render himself popular. He treated all his noblemen as if they had been his own brothers: he affected to appear the father of his people. His personal accomplishments and gallantry recommended him to the favour of the female sex, which he cultivated with the most assiduous address. By his affable deportment he ingratiated himself with all degrees of people; the meanest suppliant was admitted to his presence, and every day was distinguished by his acts of compassion and generosity. During this season of peace and good humour, his chief counsellors advised him to con∣vert his thoughts to matrimony, that he might see the succession settled upon his own issue. He seemed to relish the advice; and three matches were pro∣posed for his acceptance. The first was Margaret sister of the Scottish king; but besides that this princess was already betrothed to Edward the son of Henry, she was too young for consummation. The second was Isabel of Castile, who afterwards married Ferdinand king of Arragon; but she too was judged to be too young for wedlock. Bona of Savoy, sister to the queen of France, was the third princess proposed as a consort for Edward, who deter∣mined to demand her in marriage; and for this purpose, the earl of Warwick was appointed ambassador extraordinary to the French court, where the lady resided. We have already observed, that the chief aim of Lewis was to reduce the exorbitant power of his grandees, and particularly to abase the dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne. The first of these was so powerful that he durst not attack him openly; and therefore he resolved to begin with the duke of Brit∣tany, on pretence of a dispute which had long subsisted between the crown of France and the sovereigns of that province, touching the nature of the homage which the duke should pay to the French monarch. The kings of France had always demanded liege, and the dukes never granted more than simple homage; so that both sides used to enter a protest at every new investiture. Lewis, re∣solving to make use of this pretext, ordered a body of troops to rendezvous in Anjou, and then sent the chancellor de Morvilliers with an order to the duke of Bretagne, prohibiting him from assuming any right of sovereignty within his own dominions. The duke being in no condition to oppose such an antagonist in the field, had recourse to stratagem, and desired he might be indulged with a delay of three months, that he might consult the estates of his dutchy. His request being granted, he employed this interval in caballing among the peers
<PB N="386" REF="3960"/>
of France, with whom he joined in a powerful confederacy, which was after∣wards distinguished by the name of the League of the Public Good.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>Such was the situation of affairs in France, when Edward sent the earl of Warwick to demand Bona of Savoy in marriage; and nothing could have been more agreeable than this proposal to Lewis, who earnestly wished for an alliance with England, which would prevent Edward from interfering with his designs. He accordingly assented to the proposition; and that he might reap all the advantage that could be produced from such a connexion, he spun out the treaty of marriage, in hope of concluding a lasting peace, and en∣gaging in a bond of personal friendship with the king of England: he was also desirous of extending this alliance to the duke of Burgundy, that Francis duke of Bretagne might be deprived of all assistance and protection. With this view, he agreed with Edward and Philip to hold a congress at Hesdin, from whence it was afterwards transferred to St. Omer. But this produced nothing but a prolongation of the truce. In the course of the same year, another truce was concluded with Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land for fifteen years; and in the month of August ambassadors arrived in England from the duke of Brittany, who, finding him∣self hard pressed by the king of France, sollicited a truce for one year with Ed∣ward, who, notwithstanding his negotiation with Lewis, granted the duke's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

Edward, chancing to hunt in Nor∣thamp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, went to visit Jaquelina of Luxemburg, the dutchess of Bedford, who, after the death of her first husband, had given her hand to Sir Richard Wideville. By this second ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riage she had among other children a daughter called Elizabeth, married to Sir John Grey of Groby, who had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain in the service of the house of Lancaster. The young widow had retired to her father's house at Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton, after having seen her husband's estate con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscated; and she took this opportunity of throwing herself at Edward's feet, and im∣ploring a maintenance for herself and children, out of their father's fortune. Edward, naturally of an amorous complexion, could not behold this beau∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eous widow at his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet without emotion. He was instantly captivated by her charms, and rai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing her from the ground, made a favourable answer to her request. He con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ided so much in his station and personal qualifications, as to imagine he should ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily triumph over her virtue and caution; and found op∣portunities to make <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er acquainted with the nature of his passion. He had for o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, however, over-rated his own address; she rejected his proposals with disdain, and told him; that, although she was unworthy of being his queen, she thought herself too good to be his concubine. This declaration completed her conquest over the heart of Edward, who now approved of her spirit and discretion, as much as he admired her beauty: in a word, he laid aside his for∣mer suit, which she could not have granted with any regard to her honour, and offered his hand as the price of her condescension. It is not to be supposed she could have any reason to refuse such an offer from a young prince of Ed∣ward's
<PB N="387" REF="3970"/>
character and accomplishments. She embraced the proposal with trans∣port, and such marks of sensibility as effectually secured the heart of her admirer.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>Nevertheless, he would not proceed farther in this affair, without communicating his intention to his mother the dutchess of York, who was extremely surprized and concerned at his passion, and used all her endeavours to dissuade him from engaging in such an impolitic alliance. She observed, that such a precipitate engagement would be an irreparable injury and affront to the earl of Wawick, as well as to the French king; and, in all probability, intail upon him the resentment of both, to the reproach of his character and imminent danger of his crown; that the nobles in England would justly take umbrage at his raising the family of Wideville so far above all their honours; that he could not, without degrading his dignity, give his hand to a private gentlewoman, his own subject, who had several children by a former husband; and lastly she told him, that since he was determined to take an English wife, without the considerations of high birth and opulent fortune, he ought to give the preference to a young lady called Elizabeth Lucy, whom he had formerly promised to espouse. To these observations Edward replied, that he could not think of sacrificing his passion which was certain, to the resentment of Warwick which was uncertain; that the king of France would be too much engaged with his own domestic affairs, to think of troubling his neighbours; that his taking a wife from among his subjects, far from giving umbrage, would be agreeable to his nobility, as all their families for the future might aspire at the same ho∣nour; and with respect to Elizabeth Lucy, he denied that any promise of mar∣riage had been made to that young lady. But lest the report of such an en∣gagement might be afterwards used as a pretext for invalidating the match upon which he had now set his heart, he desired that Elizabeth might be ex∣amined by the bishops, touching the nature of her correspondence with him; when she owned that he had never engaged himself to her by promise of mar∣riage; though at the same time she declared that she would never have con∣sented to the gratification of his desires, if she had not thought his intentions were honourable. From this answer, the prelates determined that he might marry another woman with a safe conscience; and Edward espoused Elizabeth Wideville so privately, that the marriage was not divulged until he thought proper to issue orders for her coronation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowe.</NOTE></P>

<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">

<P>The nobility and people were not a little surprized when they under∣stood that this extraordinary match had been concluded, while the king carried on a negotiation at the court of France <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or a marriage with the princess of Sa∣voy. The first families of the kingdom were extremely disgusted at the pro∣motion of Elizabeth and her relations; for her father was elevated to the dig∣nity of earl of Rivers; her sister Margaret was matched with Thomas lord Matravers, son and heir of William earl of Arundel; her brother Anthony Wideville espoused the only daughter and heir of the lord Scales the richest for∣tune in the kingdom; and her son Thomas being created marquis of Dorset, married the heiress of the lord Bonneville. But the disgust of the nation in general was a trifling circumstance, when compared with the resentment of the earl of Warwick, who looked upon this clandestine match as the greatest insult and affront that could be offered to his honour. He considered it as a
<PB N="388" REF="3980"/>
fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>grant proof of ingratitude in Edward, whom he had raised to the throne; and he could not help communicating his sentiments to the king of France, who did not fail to encourage and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oment his indignation. That prince was incensed against Edward for the outrage offered to the honour of his family; but his own affairs would not allow him to manifest his resentment, which he therefore resolved to dissemble until he should find some favourable opportunity to do himself justice. Lewis had nothing princely in his disposition, except personal courage, of which he had exhibited repeated proofs before he ascended the throne of France: but he was a cool, selfish, dissembling politician, who knew how to disguise his sentiments and designs; who could stoop to the meanest co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>descensions, when he thought his interest would be promoted by such compliance; and whose reign was a continual exertion of low cunning, by which he sometimes overshot his purpose, and never failed to incur the con∣tempt of his neighbours.</P>

<P>The earl of Warwick returned to England glowing with resent∣ment and revenge, which, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e concealed with great care and circum∣spection; and from this very dissimulation, Edward divined the nature of his se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>timents: but, as it was the interest of both to disguise their real thoughts, the king continued to treat him with exterior marks of respect; and the earl maintained his place in the council, until his credit and influence were wholly superseded by the earl of Rivers. In the mean time the ceremony of the queen's coronation was performed at Westminster on the twenty-sixth day of May, with great pomp and magnificence; though neither Warwick nor his brothers the earl of Northumberland, and George lately promoted to the archbishopric of York, assisted on this occasion. These two seem to have absented them∣selves from disgust; but the earl of Warwick was at that time in Boulogne with the lords Hastings and Wenlock, as ambassadors from Edward sent to treat about a commercial truce with the count of Charolois, and the envoys of his fa∣ther Philip duke of Burgundy. This negotiation miscarried through the count's attachment to the house of Lancaster, from which he was descended by his mother: but Warwick and his colleagues, being empowered to treat with the ambassadors of France and Brittany, concluded a truce with both these powers, though they were at war with each other.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Brittany had not only engaged the count de Charolois and the duke of Bourbon in the war of the Public Good, but even brought over the French king's brother the duke of Berry, to the interest of the confederates. The count de Charolois was personally incensed against Lewi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who had, by bri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the ministers of his father Philip, obtained the restitution of the towns upon the Somme, for the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ideration of four hundred thousand crowns, ac∣cording to the treaty of Arras; and afterwards employed the Bastard of Ru∣bempre, and others, to surprize the persons of the duke and the count, and bring them to him either dead or alive. His scheme being detected, the count de Charolois was so exasperated at his per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idy, that he raised a numerous army and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> approached Paris, while the duke of Brittany and the rest of the confederates made preparations to join him with a strong reinforcement. Lewis, who was then in the Bourbonnois, being informed of his motions, marched directly to∣wards the capital. Both armies meeting at Monthlery, a battle ensued, and both sides claimed the victory. The king threw himself into Paris, and took
<PB N="389" REF="3990"/>
such precautions for the defence of that capital, that, when the confederates joined, they found it so well fortified, that they could not undertake the siege with any prospect of success. At length the war was terminated by a treaty signed at Conflans, by which Lewis restored to the duke of Burgundy the towns situated upon the Somme; and granted Normandy as an appanage to his brother the duke of Berry. After the ratification of this agreement, the count de Charo∣lois returned to the Low Countries; and the duke of Berry, accompanied by the duke of Brittany, went to take possession of Normandy, where, in a few days these two princes happening to quarrel, the duke of Brittany retired to his own dominions. Lewis, taking advantage of this dissension, marched without delay into Normandy, from whence he expelled his brother, who found him∣self obliged to take refuge in Brittany, where, notwithstanding his quarrel with the duke, he met with an hospitable reception.</P>

<P>All these different powers negotiated at the same time with Ed∣ward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

During these transactions, Isabel de Bourbon, second wife of the count de Charolois, dying, he began to look upon Edward in a different light from that in which he had considered him before. He saw him triumphing over all op∣position, and firmly settled on the throne of England; he foresaw nothing but mischief to himself from the conjunction of Edward and Lewis; and the fairest advantage from an alliance with the king of England. In these sentiments he demanded Edward's sister Margaret in marriage; and this proposal was very agreeable to the English monarch, who knew that Lewis hated him in his heart on account of his sister-in-law Bona; that all his advances aad professions were insincere; and that sooner or later he would manifest his resentment: besides, it was not the interest of England to sit tamely neutral, and see the French king ruin the dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne. He therefore, on the twelfth day of October, signed a treaty of personal alliance, friendship, and fraternity, with the count de Charolois; and sent a safe-conduct to Lewis of Bruges lord of Gruthuysen, whom the duke of Burgundy had appointed as his plenipotentiary, to treat with Edward concerning a perpetual peace, and regulate the conditions of the marriage between the count de Charolois and the princess Margaret.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Mean while the duke of Brittany was hard pressed by Lewis: since the duke of Berry had been expelled from Normandy, he was supported by this prince, who endeavoured to execute the treaty of Conflans; and the count de Charolois engaged to make a powerful diversion in Picardy. But his father Philip having undertaken a war against the inhabitants of Liege, the count could not possibly perform his promise; so that the duke of Brittany was obliged to temporize with Lewis, by entering into a negotiation with him about his giving up his right of sovereignty. This, however, was no more than an expedient to gain time, until the count of Charolois should be in a condition to give him effectual assistance. Accordingly, the war of Liege being suspended by a truce, the count was on the eve of marching into Picardy, when Lewis, by his intrigues, induced the Liegeois to recommence hostilities, which pre∣vented him from carrying his scheme into execution; and the duke of Brittany was left to struggle alone against the whole power of France. By this time Ed∣ward's
<PB N="390" REF="4000"/>
queen was delivered of the princess Elizabeth, who proved the means of extinguishing the fatal quarrel between the houses of York and Lancaster; and the kingdom enjoyed profound tranquility.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 145.</NOTE> Lewis of France continued his operations against the duke of Brit∣tany, who lost all the places he possessed in Lower Normandy, and saw himself on the brink of being attacked in his own proper dominions, while the forces of Burgundy were still employed against the inhabitants of Liege: but the French king understanding by his spies, that the negotiation between Edward and Phi∣lip related to the defence of Bretagne, he exerted all his art and influence to divert the king of England from those engagements with his enemies. He sent the Bastard of Bourbon and the archbishop of Narbonne, as his ambassadors to London, with proposals of alliance with Edward, who pretended to be intirely free of all connexions, and immediately appointed commissioners to treat with these envoys: but he found means to protract the negotiation; and Lewis was afraid to drive the duke of Bretagne to extremity, left the king of England should break off the treaty, and declare in that prince's favour. Such was the situation of affairs when Philip duke of Burgundy died; and was succeeded by his only son the count de Charolois, who, on the very day of his father's death, ratified the alliance with Edward, and declared himself more zealous than ever in support of the duke of Brittany.</P>

<P>Mean while the court of England underwent considerable changes, which were productive of infinite mischief to the nation. As the queen's rela∣tions advanced in Edward's favour, the earl of Warwick and his brothers de∣clined in their interest, and were every day subjected to new mortifications. The post of chancellor, which had been occupied by the archbishop of York, was taken in an abrupt and disobliging manner from that prelate, and given to the bishop of Bath and Wells, one of the queen's most zealous partisans. The earl of Warwick was no longer employed in any affair of importance; and his brother the marquis of Montague was kept at a distance from court, by his office of warden of the Scottish marches. On the other hand, the earl of Rivers was elevated to the highest pinnacle of greatness. To the post of lord high treasurer, which he already possessed, was added that of high constable, vacant by the resignation of the earl of Worcester, whom the king created his lieute∣nant in Ireland under the duke of Clarence; and the survivancy of the consta∣ble's place was conferred upon the earl's son Anthony Wideville. The queen's sister Catherine was married to Henry duke of Buckingham; and another sister called Anne matched with George son and heir of the earl of Kent, for∣merly Edmund lord Grey of Ruthvin: William, eldest son of the lord Herbert, espousing Mary a third sister of the queen, was created lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of Dunstar, and afterwards earl of Huntingdon; and his sister Margaret was given in marriage to Thomas Talbot viscount L'Isle. These honours and alliances given and contracted in favour of an obscure family, excited the hatred and envy of the commons as well as of the nobility, who could not but repine at the king's par∣tiality in behalf of his wife's relations. But of all the nobility, the earl of War∣wick and his brothers had the greatest reason to complain of these promotions, to some of which they were more than any other persons in the kingdom in∣titled,

by the great services they had done to Edward. Instead of being re∣compenced as they deserved, over and above the indelible affront offered to the earl in the affair of the lady Bona, he was excluded from all share in the admi∣nistration, subjected to a series of slights and insults from the queen and her kindred, who seemed intent upon driving him from court, lest he should one day retrieve his credit at the council; and at last, the king, by act of parlia∣ment, resumed all grants of lands and offices since the day of his accession, except in certain cases mentioned in special provisos, added to the act when it obtained the royal assent. These were chiefly in favour of the clergy and cor∣porations; but, Edward's real view in this bill, was to render the house of Nevil dependent on his pleasure, for the enjoyment of those estates with which their services had been rewarded. So many concurring motives could not fail to operate strongly on the resentment of Warwick, who was one of the proudest noblemen that England ever produced: he therefore could no longer dissemble his disgust, but retired to his castle of Middleham in Yorkshire.</P>

<P>In the mean time Edward amused the ambassadors of Lewis with hopes of a perpetual alliance, until the marriage between the duke of Burgundy and his sister Margaret was concluded; then she departed from England, accom∣panied by the dutchess of Exeter and Suffolk; and the nuptials were solem∣nized at Bruges with incredible magnificence. The remaining part of the win∣ter was employed in negotiating an alliance with the duke of Brittany, under the mediation of Edward's new brother-in-law, who was so much embarrassed by the war of Liege, that he could yield very little assistance to that ally. At<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

In the beginning of August, the king sent ambassadors to France, on pretence of treating with Lewis about a perpe∣tual peace; and in less than three days after their departure, subscribed a treaty, by which he obliged himself to reinforce the duke of Brittany with three thou∣sand archers. These troops being levied, the king bestowed the command of them upon his brother-in-law Anthony Wideville, lord Scales, who proposed to set sail for Brittany in the beginning of October. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>During these negotiations at London, the dukes of Bretagne and Berry were reduced to great difficulties. The truce they had obtained of Lewi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was almost expired; the English succours were not yet arrived; and the duke of Burgundy was still hindered by the war of Liege, from marching to their relief. At length, however, that prince found an opportunity to bring his enemies to a battle, in which they were defeated, and obliged to sue for peace; which was granted on pretty favourable conditions. Immediately after the rati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cation of the treaty, he began his march into Picardy, and had already advanced to the banks of the Somme, when he was informed, that his allies had mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce with Lewis; that the duke of Berry had renounced all foreign alliances; and resigned all claim upon Normandy, in consideration of a moderate pension, and a small estate in land. Charles was not a little confounded, when he received the account of this transaction: nevertheless, he would not retire, but continued <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncamped in the same place; on this supposition, that as the duke of Brittany had submitted on compulsion, he would retract his eng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gements with Lewis, upon seeing himself so powerfully supported. This resolution of Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="392" REF="4020"/>
alarmed the king of France, who began to fear what the other hoped; and in this apprehension set out for Picardy, to treat of an accommodation with the duke of Burgundy. That prince, uncertain with respect to the resolves of the duke of Bretagne, consented to retire, on payment of four hundred thousand crowns, which Lewis disbursed for the expence of his expedition.</P>

<P>Hitherto the French king had succeeded to his wish, in dissolving the league which had been formed against him, and reducing his brother to an incapacity of hurting him for the future; but, still he hankered after the ex∣ecution of his first project, to ruin the duke of Brittany, that he might after∣wards humble the rest of his nobility; and even reduce the over-grown power of the duke of Burgundy. This was his favourite scheme; and seemed to en∣gross his whole attention so much, that he was betrayed by it into the most dangerous inadvertency. After having signed his treaty with the duke of Bur∣gundy, he resolved to con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er with him personally; hoping, by his eloquence and insinuation, to detach him intirely from the interests of the duke of Bre∣tagne: at least, he thought he should be able to sow such jealousies between these allies, as would produce an harvest that would turn out to his advantage. With this view, he demanded a safe-conduct from the duke, by virtue of which he might visit him at Peronne; and, this being granted, he repaired to that place with a very slender retinue. Before he took this resolution, he had sent ambassadors to persuade the inhabitants of Liege to renounce the last peace, and take arms against Charles; in which case he promised to supply them with powerful succours. He had even forgot to recal the ambassadors, who suc∣ceeded so well in their negotiation, that the Ligeois immediately recommenced hostilities; and, intelligence of this was brought to Charles while the king of France was with him at Peronne. The duke of Burgundy was so incensed at this double-dealing in Lewis, whose aim he imagined was to surprize him un∣provided for his own defence, that he put the French king under arrest in the castle of Peronne; and detained him prisoner for some days, during which he wavered in his resolution, about the conduct he should observe upon such an occasion. Lewis, whose own knavish disposition taught him to dread the de∣signs of his enemy, remained all that time under the utmost terror and agitation; and resolved to purchase his liberty, by submitting to all the conditions that the duke should please to impose. But, he found in Charles such generosity, as even transcended his warmest hope. All that he demanded was, that Lewis should bestow Champagne and Brie on his brother, the duke of Berry, in lieu of Normandy, which was granted to him by the treaty of Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ans; and, that he would accompany the duke in his war against the Lig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ois. In a few days after this convention, they set out together for the country of Liege; and, Lewis had the mortification to be an eye-witness of the destruction of the ca∣pital city, which he himself had instigated to its own ruin. At length he ob∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Co∣mmes.</NOTE> his liberty, after having undergone the most dreadful apprehension of losing his life, or being detained in perpetual imprisonment.</P>

<P>About this period, Edward renewed the antient alliance between England and Arragon; so that being at peace with almost all the princes of the continent, he had nothing to fear but from domestic troubles; and of these he seemed to have but little apprehension: tho' a spirit of discontent began to diffuse itself through the nation, which was disgusted by the pride and inso∣lence
<PB N="393" REF="4030"/>
of the queen's relations. Sir Thomas Cooke, who had been mayor of London, was accused of treason by one Hawkins, a servant to lord Wenlock, and arrested; but, bailed at the request of the princess Margaret, before her marriage with the duke of Burgundy: after her departure, he was again ap∣prehended, and sent prisoner to the Tower; and his house and effects, to a very considerable value, were seized by the earl of Rivers, as treasurer of England. After having lain a long time in prison, he was tried and acquitted by several juries, tho' not released: then a bill being found against him, for misprision of treason, he was committed to the Counter, and from thence conveyed to the King's Bench in Southwark. There he continued for a long time, while the servants of Rivers plundered his houses, until he purchased his liberty with eight thousand pounds, by way of fine to the king for his offence. Nor was this the end of his persecution. The queen demanded an hundred marks for every thousand pounds of his fine; and this exaction he was obliged to pay, over and above large presents to her council. His accuser, with some others, was afterwards hanged at Tyburn, for corresponding with Margaret of Anjou and the duke of Somerset. He was apprehended on the information of a servant belonging to Robert Whittingham, taken at Queenborough with letters from France. This man being put to the torture, impeached Sir Gervase Clyfton, and several other gentlemen, who were afterwards tried and acquitted. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian.</NOTE></P>

<P>The earl of Warwick himself incurred the like imputation. The family of the Widevilles had used all their endeavours to render this nobleman suspected to the king, who had, indeed, very little reason to confide in his at∣tachment, considering the ingratitude with which his services had been repayed. He had even attempted to debauch the earl's daughter, one of the most beau∣tiful young ladies, and the richest heiress in England: an insult, for which he never could hope forgiveness from a man of Warwick's character. One would be apt to imagine, that the king and his new ministry practised every method they could devise to provoke the earl to a declaration, which would free them from a disagreeable suspence; and furnish them with a pretext to complete his destruc∣tion. Jasper earl of Pembroke arrived with a small body of troops from France, and landing near Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dlegh in Merionethshire, which was still occupied by the Lancastrians, was joined by a considerable number of the natives. With these he ravaged great part of North Wales, and burned the town of Denbigh; but, was encountered and defeated by Sir Richard Herbert. After this action, Hardlegh castle surrendered at discretion; and, Sir Richard Tonftal, Sir Henry Bellingham, Sir William Stoke, and about fifty other gentlemen, being taken in it, were sent prisoners to the Tower of London, where two of the number, condemned by the earl of Rivers as constable of England, were beheaded. With these Herbert, who was for this service created earl of Pembroke, sent a person who had brought letters from Margaret of Anjou; and he, in order to save his life, impeached, among others, the earl of Warwick; tho' the whole charge amounted to no more than that he had heard beyond sea, the earl fa∣voured the cause of Margaret and her husband. Commissaries were sent down to Middleham to examine him, and they found the accusation groundless; tho' this fresh insult gave a keener edge to his resentment.</P>

<P>The Widevilles had by this time rendered themselves so odious to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1469.</NOTE> the nobility and people, that they began to fear the consequences; and per∣suaded the king to mediate a reconciliation between them and the family of
<PB N="394" REF="4040"/>
Warwick. With this view Edward set out for Nottingham, where he effected an accommodation between the archbishop of York and the earl of Rivers; a great council was afterwards held at Coventry, to which that prelate brought his brother Warwick, and reconciled him to the lords Herbert, Staf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord, and Audeley. The king was so well pleased with the archbishop's conduct on this occasion, that he restored to him the manor of Denley, and other lands which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wyrceftre. Rymer.</NOTE> he had lost by the act of resumption. The accommodation between Warwick and those noblemen was so far from being sincere, that as soon as the cere∣mony was over, the earl repaired to his government of Calais, in order to ex∣ecute a scheme of revenge which he had already projected. He knew that George duke of Clarence, the king's brother, was incensed against Edward and his ministry, who had excluded him from all advantageous offices, and all share in the administration; and, as he was, after Elizabeth, presumptive heir to the crown, Warwick resolved to engage him in his interest. For this purpose he offered to him his daughter Isabel in marriage, and Clarence readily embraced an alliance that would put him in possession of one of the riche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and most beautiful young ladies in England. This match alarmed Edward, who en∣deavoured to prevent it by intrigues and remonstrances at the court of Rome, to which the parties had applied for a dispensation: but, by this time, Warwick had entered into a private negotiation with the French king, by whose influence the dispensation was obtained, and the marriage celebrated in the church of Notre Dame at Calais.</P>

<P>While Warwick resided in this place, he seems to have felt the pulse of the English nation, by employing his emissaries to excite an insurrection in Yorkshire. The people refusing to contribute to the maintenance of the an∣tient hospital of St. Leonard near York, they were prosecuted at law, and their effects distrained; and as they imagined the hospital subsisted by voluntary con∣tribution, they looked upon those suits as the effect of oppression. This dis∣content was fomented to such a degree, that they took to their arms, and assem∣bling to the number of fifteen thousand, began their march to the city of York, which was overwhelmed with consternation, until Warwick's brother Montague threw himself into the town with a small body of choice soldiers; and, in a sally, took Robert Hillyard their chieftain, commonly called Robin of Reddisdale, whom he ordered to immediate execution. The peasants were not discouraged by this disaster; but, choosing Sir Henry Nevil, son of lord Latimer, and Sir John Conyers, for their leaders, they advanced to Danesmore in Northamptonshire, about three miles from Banbury. The king had ordered the earl of Pembroke to march against them, at the head of twelve thousand Welshmen, and they were joined by Humphrey Stafford, lately created earl of Devon, at the head of five thousand archers; but, the two chiefs quarrelling about lodgings at Banbury, they separated forces, and Pembroke hazarding an engagement, was defeated and slain. Sir Henry Nevil had been taken in a skirmish on the eve of the battle, and killed in cold blood; a circumstance which exasperated the Yorkshire men to such a degree, that they gave no quar∣ter to the Welsh, five thousand of whom were slain on the field, or in the pursuit. The earl of Devon was seized in his return by the king's order, and beheaded at Bridgwater; and Richard earl of Rivers, with his son John, being taken at Graston, by a detachment of the rebel army, lost their heads at Northampton, by command of Sir John Conyers, who, without
<PB N="395" REF="4050"/>
having done any further mischief, retired towards Warwick, to wait for the return of the earl from Calais, by whose direction he had hitherto proceeded.</P>

<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Whether Edward was ignorant of this connexion, or thought proper to temporize, certain it is, that when Warwick, and his son-in-law Clarence, arrived in England, and offered their assistance towards re-establishing the tranquillity of the kingdom, he received them with an appearance of satis∣faction, creating Warwick chief justiciary of South Wales, constable of the castle of Cardigan, and seneschal of all the courts and forests in the shires of Carmarthen and Cardigan, offices vacant by the death of the earl of Pembroke. The king was likewise persuaded to grant a general pardon to Conyers and his followers, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho had by this time increased to sixty thousand. As the nation in general was discontented, and Margaret of Anjou, with her son and a small body of troops, reported to be at Harfleur in Normandy, ready to embark, and take advantage of the commotions in England, commissions of array were issued for raising the militia of Norfolk, Suffolk, and other maritime counties; and the queen's brother Anthony, now earl of Rivers, was sent to sea, with a strong squadron to prevent any attempts of the enemy. Whatever<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowe. Fabian.</NOTE> were the king's sentiments towards Warwick, he seems to have been bent upon making a friend of his brother Montague, perhaps with a view to lessen the power of the earl, which was very formidable. In a great council held on the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1470.</NOTE> sixth day of November, Edward asked the advice of the prelates and nobility, about providing an husband for his daughter Elizabeth, heir to the crown of England; and they unanimously concurred in recommending George, the son of Montague, as the most proper match for the young princess. Their senti∣ments on this subject being agreeable to those of Edward, he, by letters patent, advanced that young nobleman to the dignity of duke of Bedford. Such a testimony of the king's favour could not but be agreeable to Warwick and his brothers, who began again to live in a friendly correspondence with Edward, until it was interrupted by an artifice of the ministry, who dreaded the revival of that family's interest. The king, while he resided at Langley in Hertford∣shire, was invited by the archbishop of York to an entertainment, at his seat of More-park in that neighbourhood; and while the guests were employed, ac∣cording to the custom of the time, in washing hands before supper, John Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cliffe, afterwards lord Fitzwalter, told the king privately, that the archb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hop had assembled an hundred men at arms, to seize and convey his majesty to the castle of Middleham. Edward, alarmed at this intelligence, which was feigned for the purpose, made a pretence to go out; and mounting his horse, rode at full speed to Wind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or. Such an abrupt retreat was construed into a gross af∣front by the archbishop as well as by Warwick, and his son-in-law Clarence, who imagined it was a concerted scheme to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix the imputation of perfidy on them and their adherents: the former animosity was rekindled by this circum∣stance, and both sides reproached one another with great bitterness.</P>

<P>Cicely, dutchess of York, the king's mother, endeavoured to ef∣fect a reconciliation, and they met in her house of Baynard's castle; but their mutual jealousy was too deeply fixed to be eradicated at this interview. Never∣theless, Edward impowered Clarence and Warwick to array men in the counties of Warwick and Worcester, in order to suppress an insurrection in Lincolnshire, headed by Robert, the son of Richard lord Willes, Sir Thomas Dymock, and
<PB N="396" REF="4060"/>
Sir Thomas de la Launde. The pretext for this commotion was the conduct of Sir Thomas Burgh, an o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icer of the king's houshold, who had oppressed the people<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> though it afterwards appeared that Warwick and Clarence had in∣stigated the leaders to raise the disturbance. Edward sent for the lord Willes and Dymock to come to London, and give an account of the insurrection. They set out accordingly; but being informed on the road that the king was incensed against them as the authors of the rising, they took re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uge in the sanctuary at Westminster, from whence they were drawn by the king's promise of pardon; and the lord Willes, by Edward's command, wrote a letter to his son, desiring he would lay down his arms, and submit to the king's mercy. To this injunc∣tion, however, Robert payed no regard; and Edward, advancing with an army against him to Staniford, was so incensed at his obstinacy, that he ordered his father and Dymock to be beheaded. This act of barbarity enraged him to such a degree, that although his army consisted of raw, undisciplined troops, and he expected to be joined by Warwick and Clarence, who had already as∣sembled a strong body of forces, he resolved to revenge his father's death without delay, and attacked Edward with incredible fury, on the fourteenth day of March. The battle was maintained for some time with equal resolution on both sides: but, at length, the rebels were obliged to yield to the discipline and valour of the royal army, and were defeated with great slaughter. Ten thousand men are said to have been slain in this engagement; and the general, with Sir Thomas de la Launde, being taken prisoners, were beheaded imme∣diately after the action.</P>

<P>Mean while Warwick and Clarence marched into Lancashire, in hope of being reinforced by Thomas Lord Stanley, who had married the earl's sister; and from thence they intended to advance into Yorkshire, where they expected to be joined by those insurgents who had risen under Sir John Con∣yers. In order to facilitate that junction, they employed emissaries to alarm them with reports that the king intended to revoke the pardon he had granted: they were disappointed however in both expectations. Stanley refused to em∣bark in their undertaking, and the king got the start of them in Yorkshire; where he published a proc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amation confirming the former amnesty. The two chi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fs, being thus disappointed, retired to the western parts of England; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.

While Clarence and Warwick were employed in Devonshire, in equipping a number of vessels to convey them and their families to Calais, Edward obliged Warwick's brother, John Nevil, to resign what he possessed of the Piercy estate, with his patent for the honour of Northumberland; and, by way of recompence, created him marquis of Montacute. In con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equence of his resignation, Henry Piercy was declared earl of Northumberland, restored to all his estate, and appointed warden of the East and Middle Marches towards Scotland. John Tiptot, earl of Worcester, and constable of England for life, was constituted lord-lieutenant of Ireland, in the room of the duke of Clarence; and a price set upon the heads of that prince and his father-in-law the earl of Warwick. At the same time the king pub∣lished a declaration, representing that George duke of Clarence, and Richard earl of Warwick, had formed an unnatural design to dethrone his majesty;
<PB N="397" REF="4070"/>
that they had encouraged Sir Robert Willes in his rebellion, with promise of succours, as appeared from the confession of the said Sir Robert and Sir Tho∣mas de la Launde; that the king had summoned the duke and earl to his pre∣sence, to clear themselves of those accusations; but, instead of obeying his order, they had marched into Lancashire, in order to raise a greater number of forces, with which they hoped to execute their treacherous designs: that, notwith∣standing these repeated acts of rebellion, he was still willing to forgive them, on their submission, and giving sureties for their future behaviour; and therefore summoned them to appear before him by the twenty-eighth day of March, on pain of being denounced rebels and traitors. As they paid no regard to this declaration, another was actually published at Nottingham, on the thirty-first day of March, declaring them rebels and traitors; offering rewards for taking them, and prohibiting all persons, on the severest penalties, from assisting<NOTE PLACE="marg">Claus. 10 Ed.

<P>That his brother and Warwick might not have time to assemble an army in the West, Edward marched thither with great expedition; and from Exeter issued commissions to the earl of Wilts, the lord Mountjoye, Sir John Fortescue, and others, for arraying men in Devon and Cornwall: but before these troops could be assembled, Clarence and Warwick embarked at Dart∣mouth. When they attempted to enter the harbour of Calais, the cannon of the place began to play upon them; so that they were obliged to stand out to sea; and the dutchess of Clarence falling in labour, was delivered of a son named Edward, who was afterwards earl of Warwick. The grandfather of this child was not a little mortified at this treatment from his own lieutenant Vaucler, a Gascon, who was prevailed upon to consent to the inf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt's being christened in the place, and found means to let the earl know the meaning of his unexpected behaviour. The place was not provided for a siege against the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. de Co∣mines.</NOTE> power of Edward and the duke of Burgundy: the inhabitants were apprehen∣sive of losing their trade; and the lord of Duras, who was Warwick's enemy, commanded a good part of the garrison. Vaucler therefore advised the earl to retire into France; and depend upon his fidelity. Perhaps this Gascon played a double game, and resolved to declare for the strongest: but in the mean time his behaviour was very agreeable to Edward, who gratified him with the government of the place; while a pension of a thousand crowns was settled on him by the duke of Burgundy. Warwick, being obliged to admit of his excuses, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed for Normandy, and landed at Honfleur, where he was courteously received by the bastard of Bourbon, lieutenant-general of the pro∣vince; from thence he and his son-in-law set out for the court of France at Amboise, where he met with a very favourable reception.</P>

<P>Lewis would not intermeddle in the affairs of England, while the crown was in dispute between Edward and Henry: but now that Edward had contracted such a firm alliance with the duke of Burgundy, his interest prompted him to effect the ruin of both, and his interest on this occasion co-operated with his desire of revenging the affront he had received from Edward in the affair of the marriage. Besides, the succours which that monarch intended for the duke of Brittany, plainly demonstrated, that while he should possess the throne of England, the princes of France would always have recourse to his protection. All these considerations concurred in favour of the English fugitives, to
<PB N="398" REF="4080"/>
whom he promi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d a very powerful assistance. That the civil war, which he hoped to kindle in England, might rage with the greater violence, he resolved, if possible, to reconcile Margaret of Anjou and Warwick; and in the mean time sent for Margaret, who had retired to the habitation of her father. She looked upon Warwick as the author of all the miseries to which she and her family had been subjected; and the most rancorous and inveterate enmity sub∣sisted between them: nevertheless the accommodation was easily effected, be∣cause they stood in need of each other. Warwick wanted a pretext for de∣throning Edward, and the most plausible he could use was the restoration of Henry, which he could not undertake without the queen's concurrence. Mar∣garet, on the other hand, saw no prospect of the re-establishment of her family, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in the assistance of Warwick; and therefore made no scruple to ask the pro∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of her antient adversary. Lewis managed the treaty between them, which was concluded, on condition that the duke of Clarence and the earl of Warwick should exert all their endeavours for Henry's restoration; that the queen should engage upon oath to leave the administration in their hands, du∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the life of Henry, or the minority of his son, in case of his accession to the throne before <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should be of age; and that the prince of Wales should marry Anne, the younger daughter of the earl of Warwick.

<P>The duke of Burgundy, being informed by his spies of this tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsaction, transmitted an account of it to Edward, who payed very little regard to the intimation; believing that the earl of Warwick, who had been obliged to quit the kingdom for want of proper support, could never in his absence excite the people of England to rebel in his favour. He was not at all alarmed by the preparations in France, because he thought England could not be con∣quered by any foreign nation, unless the people should assist in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nslaving them∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves; and reasoning upon very precarious principles, namely, the affection of his subjects for his person and government, and Warwick's want of interest, he took no manner of precautions in his own defence, but indulged himself in all the pleasures of effeminacy and volup<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uousness. While <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e abandoned himself to these delights, his ministry gratified their private resentment by committing acts of cruelty and oppression, which ruin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the character of their master. John Clapham, one of Warwick's officers, with about twenty other gentlemen, being taken in a naval skirmish near Southampton, were condemned as traitors by the earl of Worcester, constable of England, and executed with such circumstances of barbarity as filled the spectators with horror. All per∣sons of any consideration, suspected of affection to the house of Lancaster, were prosecuted, plundered, and forced into sanctuary or exile; a great number of these refugees retired to France, and gave an account of the temper of the na∣tion to the earl of Warwick, whom they pressed to embark for his own country, where all sorts of people ardently wished for his return. What contributed more than any other consideration to Edward's security, was the success of a private negotiation, into which he had entered with his brother Clarence. He won over to his interest a female domestic and favourite of the dutchess; and, after having tutor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d her for his purpose, granted her a passport, by virtue of which she crossed the sea unmolested to her mistress.

of executing her commission, representing to the duke, in the name of his brother Edward, that by espousing the party of Warwick he contributed to his own ruin; for, if the designs of that nobleman should succeed, he could not imagine that the house of Lancaster would place any confidence in a prince of the family of York; or even suffer him to live, after they should have effected their pur∣poses: that, far from depending upon the oath of Margaret, he ought to consi∣der it as a share laid for his destruction; the earl of Warwick would be the first to crush him, not only to remove a rival in the administration, but also to de∣liver himself from the designs of a prince, who might one day be in a condition to return the wrongs of his family: that his brother Edward having but one child, and that an infant, which death might remove, he was next heir to the crown; whereas, should the house of Lancaster be restored, he must resign all hopes of attaining that dignity, as Henry's son was healthy and vigorous, and would in all probability have a numerous issue. These arguments were rein∣forced by the considerations of consanguinity, and warm professions and promises from Edward in behalf of his brother Clarence; who being naturally easy, fickle, and irresolute, was convinced by these insinuations; and desired the agent to let the king his brother know, that he would not fail to declare in his favour, whenever an opportunity should offer of doing him any considerable piece of service. Edward was made acquainted with this declaration, which entirely ba∣nished every anxious reflexion; and he gave a loose to his pleasures, in full con∣fidence that all Warwick's efforts would prove abortive, as he was no longer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Biondi.

<P>While Edward lived in this deceitful security, the earl, having received a small supply in money and troops from Lewis, prepared for his voyage to Eng∣land, under the convoy of some French ships of war, commanded by the bastard of Bourbon. The duke of Burgundy however blocked up the mouth of the Seine with a much more numerous fleet, in order to intercept Warwick, whom he affected to consider as a pirate; because, in his passage from Calais to Hon∣fleur, he had taken and sold fome Flemish vessels. Notwithstanding all the duke's precautions for preventing the earl's voyage, that nobleman repaired to Havre de Grace, and taking the opportunity of a storm that dispersed the Bur∣gundian squadron, embarked and landed safely at Dartmouth, in the month of September. Edward rejoiced at his descent, in full persuasion that his design must miscarry, and his antagonist fall into his hands. In these sentiments he desired the duke of Burgundy would order his fleet to keep the sea, to intercept Warwick, in case he should attempt to make his escape; but he soon per∣ceived the folly of his expectation. Warwick, immediately after his landing, was joined by such numbers of his countrymen, that in a few days he found himself at the head of sixty thousand fighting men, with whom he began his march against Edward, who had made a progress into the North, to quell an in∣surrection raised in Yorkshire by the lord Fitzhugh, married to Alice, sister of the earl of Warwick. His design, in all probability, was to make a di∣version in favour of his brother-in-law; and in this he succeeded. At the king's approach he retired to Scotland, and Edward repaired to York, where he first heard that Warwick had landed and proclaimed Henry VI. king of Eng∣land; publishing at the same time an order to all his subjects, from sixteen to sixty, to take arms against Edward, and expel the usurper.</P>

<P>The king immediately advanced as far as Nottingham, in his way to London; but, Warwick being resolved to engage him before he should reach that capital, where he knew he was very popular, came in sight of him within three miles of Nottingham, and prepared for battle. Edward was so weak as to depend upon the fidelity of the marquis of Montacute, tho' the brother of his adversary, and a nobleman whom he had so lately injured by depriving him of the great estate and honour of Northumberland. He had raised six thousand men, with whom he followed the king at some distance, as if his intention had been to reinforce his majesty; but, his real aim was to join his brother, and he had already conce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d the affair with his officers. When he therefore understood that Warwick was so near the royalists, he quickened his march, in order to fall upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear of Edward, who had no intimation of his design until he was within two leagues of his camp, and the air refounded with the cries of Long live King Henry. In this emergency he called a coun∣cil of war, in which the lord Hastings gave it as his opinion, that great part of the army would revolt to the earl of Warwick; or that even<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tho' they should do their duty, they would not be able to cope with the rebels, since this defection of Montacute. He therefore advised his majesty to provide for his personal safety, by retreating to the sea-side, where he might find an opportunity to escape into Holland. As there was no time to be lost, Edward, in compliance with this advice, set out at midnight for Lynne, without money or baggage, at∣tended by eight hundred light horse: finding in the harbour of that town two or three ships bound for Holland, he instantly embarked with his brother Gloucester, and a small retinue; and, after having narrowly escaped a fleet of Easterlings, landed at Alkmar. In the morning after Edward's retreat, his army submitted to Warwick, who forthwith directed his march to London, which he entered in triumph on the sixth day of October, and removed Hen∣ry VI. from the Tower to the bishop's palace; while Edward's queen took re∣fuge<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowe.

<P N="37">XXXVII. In consequence of this surprising revolution, which had been effected in eleven days, without bloodshed, all the judges, sheriffs, and coro∣ners, of the kingdom were changed: Lanstrother prior of St. John's was ap∣pointed treasurer; the chancellor's office was conferred on the archbishop of York; the earl of Warwick was created admiral of England; and the duke of Clarence constituted lord lieutenant of Ireland. On this occasion no life was taken but that of John Tiptot earl of Worcester, who seems to have been sa∣crificed to the public hatred, as a corrupted minister, and a monster of cruelty, for which he was so remarkable, that he acquired the appellation of John the Butcher. Being taken on the top of an high tree in the forest of Wavebrig, in Huntingdonshire, he was brought to London, tried in Westminster-Hall by John carl of Oxford, convicted of high treason, condemned, and beheaded on Tower-Hill. Writs were issued for summoning a parliament, which met on the twenty-sixth day of November. Edward was declared a traitor and usur∣per, his estate and effects were confiscated; all statutes made by his authority re∣pealed; and the duke of Gloucester, and all his adherents, attainted. The crown was se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d upon Henry, and the male issue of his body; and, in default there∣of, on the duke of Clarence and his descendents: and this duke and the earl of

Lewis XI. had declared war ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst him, and seized St. Quintin and Amiens; and now that Edward was expelled from his throne, he was afr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of intailing upon himself the joint <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mity of France and England, should he assist the exiled monarch. The dukes of Som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rset and Exeter, who still continued at his court, pressed him strongly to abandon Edward, and even threaten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him with the ind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnation of Henry, should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e protect, or patronize the fugitive; and the earl of Warwi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k had already s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt a body of troops to Calais, that they might be at hand to join the French, and invade some pro∣vince of the Low Countries.

Seeing no other way of succeeding in his negotiation, he observed, that the truce having been made with England, and not with the person of Edward, it ought not to be affected by the revolution in England; and as the nation was very much interested in this trade, the truce was upon these princi∣ples, renewed.</P>

<P>Edward, impatient of his situation, after his si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er the dutchess of Burgundy had in vain solli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited her husband to take some vigorous steps in his favour, demanded an interview with that prince, which he could not with any decency re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se.

In order to reinforce this remonstrance, he imparted to him the engagement he had contracted with his brother Clarence: he reminded him of the o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th by which he had bound himself to contribute his assistance, in c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e it should be wanted by Edward: he desired him to con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der, that in assisting him in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distress, he would act f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the benefit of his own family, which might one day need suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and assistance; and at the same time have the glory of re∣storing

This expostu∣lation had an effect upon the duke of Burgundy; and, though he was still afraid of furnishing Warwick with a pretext to attack his domi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, he contrived an expedient, by which he was enabled to accommodate the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugitive king, with∣o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t runni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g the risque of a rupture with that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormidable nobleman.

The king of England being thus supplied with ships and money, em∣barked at Terveer; and he had no sooner disappeared from Holland, than the duke of Burgundy, by pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lamation, prohibited all his subjects, on pain of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</NOTE> from assisting him directly or indirectly. But, if the scheme of Edward had proved abortive, this artifice would not have deceived the earl of Warwick, who at this period, concluded a long truce with Lewis, to serve in lieu of an alliance, which could not be immediately effected on account of Henry's pre∣tensions to the crown of France; and at the same time, the earl sent the great prior o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the order of St. John of Jerusalem, to conduct queen Margaret and the prince of Wales from France into England.</P>

<P>Edward sailing from Terveer, with the lords Hastings, Say, and about fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teen hundred men, partly English, and partly Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mings, attempted to land on the coast of Essex; but, being repulsed by a brother of the earl of Oxford, he stood away to the northward, and made a descent at Ravenspur in Yorkshire, abou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the latter end of March, hoping, that he should be joined by the people of those parts, as soon as he should produce the letters of invitation he had received from the earl of Northumberland. B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, he met with a very cold reception; and the inhabitants of Holdernesse took up arms to oppose his progress. He likewise understood by his emissaries, that the citizens of York were not at all disposed to receive him as sovereign of England. He therefore professed himself a liegeman to king Henry, wore the badge of the prince of Wales, which was an ostrich feather; and declared, that all he demanded was the dutchy of his father. Trusting to the effect of these professions, and the affection of the people of York, of which he was intirely possessed, although the magistrates were devoted to Warwick, he marched towards that city, and was visited by a deputation of the aldermen, who desired that he would choose another road, that they might not be under the necessity of refusing him ad∣mittance. He now again repeated his former declaration, touching his demand; and expostulated with them in a modest manner, upon the cruelty of refusing him admittance into a city, from which he derived his title, and on which he had conferred so many benefits; but, he depended more upon the attachment of the inhabitants, than the power of his eloquence; and he was not disap∣pointed in his expectation. His partisans excited a commotion in the city, and the magistrates went forth again to offer him the keys, and stipulate for

their being exempted from pillage. Edward agreed to all their proposals; and being admitted into York, alighted at the cathedral, where by a solemn oath, he confirmed his former protestations, that he would remain a loyal sub∣ject to Henry, and with respect to his demand, touching his private inheritance, leave it intirely to the determination of parliament. Having thus obtained<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian. Polyd.

<P>The news of Edward's landing had no sooner reached the court of Henry, than commissions of array were issued to the duke of Clarence, and the earls of Warwick and Pembroke, for raising forces to repel the invader: the marquis of Montacute, who had been lately appointed warden of the Scottish Marches, received an order to intercept Edward in his march to York, and engage him before he should be in a condition to fight with any prospect of success. Whether this nobleman had entered into any new engage∣ment with Edward, or wavered in his resolutions between a weak prince already on the throne, and a powerful competitor, with whom he hoped one day to be joined by the alliance of that marriage which had been formerly projected; certain it is, he remained quiet in his camp at Pontefract, and allowed Edward to pass unmolested, within four miles of his station. When this prince arrived at Not∣tingham, he was joined by Sir William Stanley, Sir William Parr, Sir Thomas Burgh, Sir William Norris, and a great number of other gentlemen, with their vassals. This junction encouraged him to publish his claim to the crown; and his number was every hour augmented, during his progress towards Lon∣don. Mean while, the earl of Warwick having levied a body of troops, ad∣vanced to Leicester, in order to join his brother Montacute, and receiving in∣telligence that Edward had taken the route to Coventry, he marched thither, with a view to hazard an engagement. When the two armies were in sight of each other, the earl received a letter from the duke of Clarence, giving him to understand that he was on the march to join him, and desiring, he would not give Edward battle until he should arrive with his forces. In compliance with this request, Warwick altered his resolution, and allowed his antagonist to proceed to London, believing that city would hold out until he should advance to its relief. This was a very flagrant piece of misconduct, even supposing him ignorant of the intelligence which the enemy carried on with the Londoners, as well as of the treachery of his own relations: he ought to have known, that the rich merchants, who had formerly lent sums of money to Edward, had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o other prospect of payment than that of his restoration; that all the ladies were devoted to a prince of his gallantry and personal accomplishments, and would necessarily influence their husbands and kindred in his behalf; that the archbi∣shop of Canterbury, the earl of Essex, with some other prelates and noblem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, were well-wishers to his cause; and, that the sanctuaries and franchises of Lon∣don and Westminster contained above two thousand of his partisans, including four hundred knights and gentlemen, ready to take arms in his favour. Perhaps all thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> advantages might have proved ineffectual, had the archbishop of York, to whose care the person of Henry, and the city of London were committed, been true to the interest of his brother Warwick. But, he had by this time made his

<P>Mean while Warwick being joined by his son-in-law Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rence and his brother Montacu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, advanced towards London; and, on the thirteenth day o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> April, encamped on a heath in the neighbourhood of Barnet, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own it∣self being possessed by the troops of Edward, who had marched thither from London to give him battle, in consequence of a message he had received from Clarence, importing that he would join him with all his forces. In the night that preceded the action, Richard duke of Gloucest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r repa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red without any safe∣guard to the tent of Clarence, where the two brothers embraced with all the marks of the most cordial affection; and after some private discourse, they went off together towards Edw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd's camp, with abo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t twelve thousand fol∣lowers. Immediately after this scandalous desertion, he sent a messenger to Warwick to excuse the part he had acted, and tell him he had made his peace with Edward, who had promised to pardon him upon his submission. But the earl rejected the proposal with disdain, either believing Edward insincere in his promi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, or that he himself was still able to cope with him in the field of battle. In all probability, his brother Montacute had found means to convince him of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, and was by this time determined to act heartily against Edward; otherwise he would, on this occasion, have imitated the example of Clarence. Early in the morning of the fourteenth day of April, the action began with in∣credible fury on both sides, which were ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sperated against each other to the most virulent degree of rancour, that slighted friendship, personal animosity, and civil war, could produce. The troops of Warwic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, though inferior in number to the enemy, fought with a kind of desperate resolution, foreseeing they should be treated as rebe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s if vanquished; and the earl himself was deter∣mined to conquer or die. Such was th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir impetuosity that Edward's first line was obliged to give ground: and some of his horse riding full speed to Lon∣don, reported that he was utterly defeated. In this emergency, he ordered his body of reserve to advance and charge the enemy in flank; and this expedient was the more successful, as the earl of Oxford had pushed the Yorkists so far, that Warwick's main body was left defe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>celess. That nobleman, however, no soo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er recollected this circumstance, than he wheeled about to resume his sta∣tion; and that movement occasioned the loss of the battle. The device on his arms and e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igns was a star shooting forth rays; and that of Edward was a sun. The followers of Warwick seeing the star advancing through the medium of a fog, mistook it for Edward's standard, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell upon their friends with such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury, that they were broken and dispersed before the earl of Oxford could rectify the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atal error. Thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> last, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lieving themselves betrayed, fled towards the enemy with great precipitation. Other parts of Warwick's army seeing them fly, imagined they had been a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tacked in the rear, and of consequence that they themselves were surrounded: they began to be seized with cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rnation; the pannic spread from rank to rank, and univer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al confusion ens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. Edward, taking the advantage of their disorder, charged them w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th redouble<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gour; and Warwick in vain used his utmost endeavours to rally and re-animate them
<PB N="405" REF="4150"/>
by his own example. In former battles he had always fought on horseback, that he might ride along the line, and perceive at once the particulars of the action: but on this occasion he had sent away his horse, and determined to fight on foot, that his soldiers might see he was resolved to share their fate in the issue of the day. Even this resolution contributed to his defeat; because he could not be personally present at every place where the men stood in need of his direction and assistance; and they were no longer encouraged by the sight of their commander. After having exerted all his capacity as an officer and hero, in fruitless attempts, he rushed into the hottest part of the battle, and fell covered with wounds; and his brother Montacute, endeavouring to disen∣gage him, met with the same fate. All opposition ended with the life of the two generals; and about noon Edward obtained a complete victory over his enemies, five thousand of whom were left dead upon the field; though the car∣nage would not have been so great, had not the king forbid his soldiers to give quarter. The earl of Oxford fled into Wales, where the earl of Pembroke was employed in raising forces for the service of Warwick; the duke of Exeter was wounded, stripped, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t for dead on the field, where he remained till the evening, when he recovered the use of his senses, and made shift to crawl to the house of one Rutland, where his wounds were cured; but he was after∣wards discovered and imprisoned in the Tower. Nor was the victory blood∣less to Edward, who lost the lord Berners and fifteen hundred men, slain<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian. Stowe.</NOTE> in the action. Such was the end of the famous earl of Warwick, who, from his great power, influence, military talents, and fortune, had acquired the epithet of the King-Maker. He was certainly a nobleman of great abilities and magnanimity; and if he had not been betrayed by those in whom he chiefly confided, Edward would not have triumphed over the house of Lancaster. On the day that succeeded the battle, the king returned to London, and ordered the naked bodies of Warwick and Montacute to be exposed in the cathedral of St. Paul's, from whence they were carried to Bisham in Berk∣shire, and interred in the priory founded by their ancestors of the house of Montacute.</P>

<P>Edward had not time to enjoy the fruits of his victory, until he was obliged to run the risk of another battle. Margaret of Anjou, after a te∣dious and dangerous passage, landed on Easter day at Weymouth in Dorset∣shire, accompanied by the prince of Wales and Edmund duke of Somerset, with a small body of French forces. When she received the tidings of War∣wick's death, and her husband's imprisonment<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all her former courage seemed to forsake her: she was overwhelmed with grief and consternation; and took refuge with her son in the sanctuary of Beaulieu, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cistertian monastery in Hampshire. Her spirits, however, revived, when she saw herself joined by John Courtenay earl of Devon, the viscount Beaumont, the lord Wenlock, Sir Hugh Courtenay, Sir John Beaufort, Sir Thomas Fulford, Sir John For∣tescue, Sir Thomas Tresham, Sir Gervase Clifton, Sir Thomas Seymour, and other gentlemen, with their vassals and adherents. She then took the field, and marching through the counties of Devon and Somerset, her followers increased to a very considerable army; until she advanced to Tewkesbury in Gloucester∣shire, from whence she proposed to march towards Wales, and join the earl of Pembroke.</P>

<P>This scheme, however, was defeated by the vigilance and activ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y of Edward, who proscribed her and all her ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erents by proclamation <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and began his march immediately towards the banks of the Severne, in order to en∣gage her before she should be joined by the earl of Pembroke. As she had been denied entrance into Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cester, where she purposed to cross the river, she had marched to Tewkesbury with the same design; but Edward was so close at her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eels, that she could not pass the Severne without exposing her rear to destruction: it was therefore resolved in a council of war, that her army should be intrenched in a park adjoining to the town, and remain in that situation till the arrival of Pembroke. This scheme was immediately put in execution; and Edw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd coming up, resolved to attack them in their intrenchments before they should be better fortified or reinforced. For this purpose he drew up his army in two lines, one of which was commanded by his brother the duke of Gloucester, while he and Clarence took their station in the second. The duke of Somerset disposed the queen's army in three lines within the intrenchments<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he himself commanded the van, that he might sustain the first shock of the enemy. The second line was commanded by the lord Wenlock, under the prince of Wales, who was considered as general in chief; and the rear was con∣ducted by the duke of Devonshire. Edward, observing that Somerset had left some openings in the front, through which he proposed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally, and being well acquainted with the impetuous disposition of that nobleman, directed his bro∣ther Gloucester, who began the attack, to decoy Somerset from his intrench∣ments, by giving ground and retreating with precipitation, until he should see the duke and his line in the open plain, and then to turn and renew the charge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in which case, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should properly be sustained. Gloucester, being thus instruct∣ed, attacked the intrenchments with great vigour, and meeting with a very warm recep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, retired in such hurry and seeming consusion, that the duke of So∣merset, believing they fled, sallied forth from his works to pursue them, after having sent an order to Wenlock to follow and sustain him, in case of emer∣gency. The duke of Gloucester having drawn his antagonist into the open plain, practised with great success the lesson he had received. His troops h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt∣ing, were in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tantly ranged in their former order; and he led them back to the charge, to the astonishment and consternation of the enemy, who had begun the pursuit in some disorder, and were now so confounded, that, instead of standing the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ault, they thought of nothing but saving themselves within their intrenchments. The duke of Somerset perceiving that the lord Wenlock had not stirred from his station to support the first line, was so incensed that he rode up and cle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his head with a battle-ax; and the duke of Gloucester entering the intrenchments with the fugitives, made a terrible carnage. The young prince of Wales, seeing all his army in confusion, did not know on which side to turn; and the duke of Somerset was so choaked with indignation, that he could hardly speak, much less take the necessary steps for reducing his troops to order. King Edw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd, following his brother with the second line, completed the overthrow of the queen's army, which was routed with great slaughter, the second and third lines having betaken themselves to flight, without striking one stroke. The earl of Devonshire and Sir John Beaufort were sound among the dead, which amounted to three thousand; the duke of Some<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>set, the great prior of St. John, and about twenty other gentlemen, retired to the abbey-church,
<PB N="407" REF="4170"/>
thinking they would have been safe in the sanctuary: from which, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian. Stowe.</NOTE> they were forcibly dragged to execution. The prince of Wales falling into the hands of his enemies, was brought into the presence of Edward, who, with an air of insolence, demanded how he durst presume to enter his kingdom in arms. To this arrogant question he replied, with great fortitude and dignity, that he had come to recover his father's crown and his own inheritance, which Edward unjustly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urped. He had no sooner pronounced these words, which would have excited the admiration and esteem of a generous enemy, than Ed∣ward struck him on the face with his gauntlet, and retired; and this seems to have been a preconcerted signal to the dukes of Clarence and Gloucester, the lord Hastings, and Thomas Grey, the son of queen Elizabeth, who in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tantly fell upon him like so many wild beasts, and hewed him in pieces.

<P>The battle of Tewkesbury, which was fought on the fourth day of May, extinguished the hopes of the house of Lancaster; though there was still a small army in the field, under the command of the earl of Pembroke: but this dispersed of its own accord, upon hearing the news of the engagement; and the earl, leaving the defence of Pembroke to Sir John Scudamore, fled into Brittany, with his nephew Henry the young earl of Richmond. While Edward was thus employed in the west, Thomas Nevil bastard of Falconbridge, who had been created vice-admiral of the channel during the administration of Warwick, and lost his employment after the death of that nobleman, assembled some vessels, and enlisting a good number of vagabonds, and people of de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe∣rate fortune, cruized along the coast of Kent, exercising the trade of piracy. At length his followers increased to such a degree, that he ventured to make a descent at Sandwich; and was admitted into Canterbury by Nicholas F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unte the mayor. His number daily augmenting, he began his march for London, at the head of seventeen thousand men; and on the fourteenth day of May entered the suburbs of Southwark, but found himself excluded from London-Bridge by the citi∣zens, who had by this time received the news of the battle of Tewkesbury.

<P>This insurrection in all probability hastened the death of the unfor∣tunate Henry, who was found dead in the Tower, to which he had been con∣fined since the restoration of Edward. The greater part of historians has al∣ledged
<PB N="40$" REF="4180"/>
that he was assassinated by the duke of Gloucester, who was a prince of the most brutal disposition; while some moderns, from an affectation of singu∣larity, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m that Henry died of grief and vexation. This, no doubt, might have been the case; and it must be owned that nothing appears in history, from which either Edward or Richard could be convicted of having contrived or perpetrated this murder: but at the same time, we must observe some concur∣ring circumstances that amount to strong pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sumptions against the reigning monarch. Henry was of a hale constitution, but just t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rned of fifty, naturally insensible of affliction, and hackneyed in the vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issitu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of fortune; so that one would not expect he should have died of age and infirmity, or that his life would have been affected by grief arising from his last disaster. His sudden death was suspicious, as well as the conjuncture at which he died, immediately after the suppression of a rebel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, which seemed to declare that Edward would never be quiet, while the head of the house of Lancaster remained alive; and lastly, the suspicion is confirmed by the characters of the reigning king and his brother Richard, who were bloody, barbarous, and unrelenting. Very dif∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erent was the disposition of the ill-fated Henry, who, without any princely vir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e or q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alification, was totally free from cruelty and revenge: on the con∣trary, he could not, without reluctance, consent to the punishment of those ma∣lefactors who were sacrificed to the public safety; and frequently sustained per∣sonal indignities of the grossest nature, without discovering the least mark of resentment. He was chaste, pious, compassionate, and charitable, and so in∣offensive, that the bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hop, who was his confessor for ten years, declared, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in all that time he had never committed any sin that required pennance or re∣buke.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> In a word, he would have adorned a cloister, though he disgraced a crown; and was rather respectable for those vices he wanted, than for the vir∣tues he possessed.

<P>While Edward thus endeavoured to strengthen his throne with foreign alliances, his tranquility was a little invaded by the return of the earl of Oxford, who had retired to France after the battle of Tewkesbury.

The king, alarmed at this exploit, ordered a detachment of troops to march against him before he should have time to form an army; and being invested, he surrendered on promise of life; but he lost his liberty and estate, which Edward confiscated, without allowing the least trifle for the subsistence of his countess, who was sister to the earl of Warwick; and he himself was conveyed to the castle of Hammes near Calais, where he remained twelve years a prisoner. John Holland duke of Exeter, who had been left for dead on the field at Barnet, retired to the sanctuary at Westmin∣ster; and intreated his wife, who was Edward's sister, to employ her good offices in his behalf: they had lived separate since the beginning of the civil war. She was now so far from befriending him with her brother, that she desired the separation might be confirmed by law; and she obtained her re∣quest, although no sufficient cause could be shewn for such confirmation.

<P>We are not to suppose that either party imagined France could be conquered by the forces they intended to assemble for this expedition. They endeavoured to deceive one another; for, as we have already observed, the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke had no other view than that of making a diversion, and Edward's ambi∣tion was limited to the recovery of Normandy and Guienne. Those treaties being ratified, and approved by the parliament in its fifth session, which granted the necessary supplies, the king began to issue commissions for levying troops; and in the mean time, sent ambassadors to different courts of Europe, to form new alliances, or at least prevent the union of the several powers with his enemy. The peace with Scotland was cemented by a contract of marriage be∣tween Edward's second daughter Cecilia, and James the son and heir of James III. king of that country; and the parties being infants, were assianced by proxy. In the mean time, Edward engaged to pay twenty thousand marks as her portion, at different terms, on condition of retouching the sum in case the marriage should not take effect. The truce was prolonged for six and forty years; and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</NOTE> the two kings engaged mutually to assist each other in suppressing all rebellions.

He asked several questions; and, by the herald's answers, understood that the properest persons to whom he could address himself, in case she should have occasion to make proposals of peace, were the lords Howard and Stanley: then he presented the messenger with three hundred crowns, and thirty yards of velvet for a robe, and dismissed him with great court<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sy.</P>

<P>Mean while Edward advanced into Picardy, where he expected to be joined by the duke of Burgundy: but that prince, instead of fulfilling his en∣gagement with his ally, was still employed in the siege of Nuys. He ob∣stinately persisted in that enterprize, although the emperor had approached the place with an army four times as numerous as that which he commanded, and harrassed him in such a manner, that he could not proceed with his operations; at the same time Sigi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mund duke of Austria made himself master of Feretti, the duke of Lorraine ravaged Luxemburg, and his truce with France was no sooner expired, than Lewis reduced Roye, Corbie, and Montdidier. Notwithstanding all this opposition, he would not raise the siege until Edward threatened to renounce his alliance; then he consented, that the place should be delivered into the hands of the pope's legate, in order to be disposed of according to the arbi∣tration of his holiness: but, when he raised the siege, his army was in such a condition, that he was obliged to put the troops in quarters of refreshment, while he himself set out with a small body to excuse himself in person to Ed∣ward.

Lewis concluded from this compli∣ment, that the court of England wanted to enter into a negotiation, but were unwilling to make the first advances; and as he himself had no scruples of that nature, he resolved to spare Edward the confusion of solliciting a treaty. He forthwith ordered a herald's coat to be made for a man, with whose discretion and address he was well acquainted<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and having instructed him for the purpose, sent him to the English army<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to demand a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e-conduct for the ambassadors of France, that they might come and treat of a pacification.

The lord Stanley, and two other noblemen, were appointed as plenipotentiaries to treat with the French ambassadors, in the neighbourhood of Amiens, between the two ar∣mies; and, on the twenty-eighth day of August, the peace was concluded, on condition, That Lewis should pay seventy-five thousand crowns, to indemnify Edward for the expe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of the armament; on the receipt of which, the king of England should immediately retire with his forces: That Lewis should like∣wise grant him an a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uity of fifty thousand crowns: That the dauphin of France should marry the princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward, and settle sixty thousand li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es a year upon her as a jointure: and, That neither party should encourage civil wars in the other's kingdom; but, that both should<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines.

<P>The duke of Burgundy no sooner understood that a treaty was on the carp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, between Lewis and Edward, than he repaired to the English army, in order to prevent its taking effect; but, before he arrived, the peace was ra∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, and Edward gave him to understand, that he might, if he would, be comprehended in the treaty, together with his other allies, the duke of Bretagne and the constable.

The constable exerted all his en∣deavours in persu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding Edward to renounce the treaty. He even offered to

Before his return to England, he and Lewis agreed to have an in∣terview on the bridge of Pequigny, with a barrier between them. The French king was accompanied by the cardinal of Bourbon, and five other noblemen, and Edward was attended by some of the English nobility. After they had ra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ified the treaty upon oath, Lewis invited Edward to Paris, where he said the ladies would endeavour to entertain him agreeably, and should he be tempted to commit any piccadillo, he should have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or his confessor the cardinal of Bour∣bon, who would not be very rigid in point of penance. The two kings rallied one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>other with great good humour, until Lewis made a signal for his atten∣dants to withdraw: the English likewise retired on their side, and their masters conferred together a considerable time; their conversation tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing upon the dukes of Burgundy, Bretagne, and the constable.

The tenderness which Edward expressed for that prince, proceeded from his having in his power the sole remaining branch of the house of Lanca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, by who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e means he could at any time have raised com∣motions in England; and therefore, Edward thought proper to cultivate the duke's friendship.

<P>The French king repaired to Amiens, accompanied by the lord Howard, who remained as hostage for Edward's performance of articles; and this nobleman, while the king washed his hands, gave his majesty to under∣stand, that Edward was not averse to an excursion to Paris. Lewis made no reply to this insinuation, until it was repeated; and then he said, that the war in which he was engaged with the duke of Burgundy, would not permit him to go to Paris; and therefore, he was sorry he could not have the honour of receiving the visit of the king of England. He dreaded nothing so much as Edward's taking a liking to France; and, above all things, wished he would re∣turn to his own kingdom. He was so apprehensive of his retracting his en∣gagements, that he distributed considerable pensions among the principal members of Edward's council, that they might use their influence in prevent∣ing an infraction of the truce. The E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glish army approaching Amiens, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ordered the gates to be thrown open, and all the inn-keepers of the place to treat the soldiers at his expence; nay, he sent three hundred waggon loads of wine to Edward's camp, as a pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent to the army. All this generosity and com∣pliment was the effect of fear, from which he was at length d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>livered by the departure of the English, who returned to their own country, extremely well pleased with their entertainment. The duke of Burgundy, when his choler subsided, accep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed a separat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> truce, which was offered to him by Lewis: and, the constable seeing himself de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erted by his allies, retired into the duke's do∣minions, on the faith of a safe-conduct; notwithstanding which, he was deli∣vered up to Lewis, who ordered him to be beheaded as a traitor. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Comines.</NOTE></P>

The duke of Brittany either b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lieving Edward sincere in his professions, or convinced by the present of a large sum of money, ordered the young earl, and his uncle Pembroke, to be put into the hands of the ambassadors, who immediately set out with their prize for St. Malo, in order to embark for England. Before they reached that port, however, the duke changed his mind, either through remorse, or suspicion of Edward's intent; and forthwith dispatched his favourite Peter Landais to St. Malo, to reclaim the refugees. He arrived just as they were going to embark, and gave such directions to the people who attended him, that while he amused the ambassadors, the earl of Richmond, and his uncle Pembroke, found means to escape, and take sanctuary in a church, from whence Landais would not suffer them to be taken. The ambassadors loudly complained of this artifice; and he made some frivolous apologies, which they would by no means admit; then he frankly told them, that the duke his master having reflected on the subject, thought he could not deliver up his guests without trespassing against the laws of honour and hospitality; but, he assured them the two earls should be guarded in such a manner as would effectually prevent them from interrupt∣ing the peace of England.</P>

<P>Immediately after the duke of Burgundy had signed the truce with Lewis, he marched against the duke of Lorrain, and subdued his whole coun∣try, without having met with any considerable resistance; then he proposed a scheme for humbling the Swiss, who had declared against him while he was em∣ployed in the siege o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nuys; and the pretext he used for denouncing war against them, was, the injury they had done to Jaques de Savoy, Count de Romont, whom they had expelled from his territories.

Then he invested Granson, which was garrisoned by eight hundred Swiss, who made a very gallant defence; at length they were obliged to submit, and the duke ordered them to be put to the sword, in contempt of the capitulation. Hearing that another body was on the march to their relief, he advanced against them with his whole army, and detached an hundred archers on horseback to take possession of a defile in the mountains, through which the Swiss were obliged to pass, in their route to the open country.

The princess, who was nineteen years of age, suc∣ceeded to her father at a time when her family was deserted by all its antient friends; so that she was exposed in a peculiar manner to the avarice of Lewis XI. who forthwith seized Burgundy, and the town<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> situated upon the Som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; and formed a scheme for depriving her of all the rest of her dominions.

But by this time Edward was grown corpulent, and unfit for carrying on a war in person: he was dissuaded from engaging in behalf of Mary by his counsellors, who were pensioners of France; and he was extremely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nwilling to take any step which might obstruct the marriage between the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uphin and his daughter Elizabeth: besides, Lewis was very punctual in the payment of the fifty thousand crowns; a gratuity which he was very loth to forego.

<P>Edward, now being at peace with all his neighbours, and his king∣dom enjoying the most profound tranquility, applied himself to the administra∣tion of justice, and made a circuit through his do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions to clear the roads of robbers, by which they had been grievously infested since he disbanded his ar∣my.

He therefore had recourse to other methods for filling his exhausted exchequer: he engaged in com∣merce, which he carried on to a great extent, as a private adventurer; he sold the profits of vacant prelacies; exacted fines for the restitution of temporalities: he searched into offices of record to find out defective titles to lands, and com∣pelled the proprietors by irregular prosecutions to pay large sums for their con∣firmation. He likewise laid frequent impositions on the clergy, and became totally infected with the vice of avarice: tho' yet still part of his time was ex∣pended i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the most effeminate amusements.</P>

While Edward lived in celi∣bacy he had flattered himself with the hope of succeeding to the throne of Eng∣land; and was so extremely mortified at his marriage, that he had never loved his brother heartily since that event: he hated the queen for the same reason, and his rancour extended to her whole family. This animosity was increased by their grasping at all the power of the administration, and interfering with him in the schemes he had formed for his own advantage. By the act of resump∣tion they had deprived him of the honour of Tutbury, and many other lands which he had enjoyed by the king's donation. His dutchess, dying imme∣diately before the death of Charles duke of Burgundy, he sollicited the good offices of his sister Margaret, widow of that prince, to effect a match between him and her step-daughter, the princess Mary.

<P>Such a disappointment could not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail to inflame the hatred of Clarence, who exclaimed against the king with great virulence; and his discontent was encouraged and fomented by the cunning insinuatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Richard duke of Gloucester. This prince had already formed a design upon the crown, which could not succeed so long as Clarence stood between him and the succession: he therefore resolved to effect his ruin, as the prelude to that usurpation, which he knew the infant children of Edward would not be able to prevent. With this view he artfully exasperated the resentment of Clarence against the king, until he uttered some rash menaces and impreca∣tions; and these he afterwards repeated with exaggerations to Edward, on pretence of cautioning him against the other's treasonable designs. The queen and her kindred, who hated Clarence, reinforced the suggestions of Richard; so that Edward looked upon his brother George as a traitor, who formed schemes against his life. This suspicion produced a coldness and disgust to∣wards Clarence, who was more and more incensed at the king's n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glect <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd sullen behaviour. He became louder in his complaints, and the mini<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry re∣solved to take the first opportunity to accomplish his destruction. In order to provoke him to some act of indiscretion that would furnish a handle for his ruin, they attacked him in his favourites and confidents, against whom they trumped up ridiculous accusations. John Stacy, a learned clergyman, and no∣ted astronomer, was charged with the exercise of negromancy; and Thom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Burdet, of Arrow, in Warwickshire, a gentleman of unblemished character<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was arrested as his accomplice, as well as on account of his having cur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e king, who had killed a favourite white hind in one of his enclosures. They were tried for these crimes in the King's bench in Westminster; and, being found guilty, executed at Tyburn; where both protested their inno<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence with great spirit and constancy.

<P>A parliament meeting at Westminster, on the sixteenth day of Ja∣nuary, Henry duke of Buckingham was appointed high steward of England, to pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de at the trial of Clarence, whose impeachment was digested into eight a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cles; importing, That by his seditious discourse he had endeavoured to prejudice the king in the minds of his sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ects, accusing his majesty of having p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to death: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he had suborned his domesticks and others to spread this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>se report: That he had accused the king of negromancy, of having destroyed by po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son divers innocent persons, whose lives could not be affected by any juridical process: That he had affirmed the king was not the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of his reputed father, but a bastard, begotten by another man, whom the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>chess of York admitted to her embraces: That Clarence, from this circum∣stance arrogating to himself a right to the crown, had demonstrated his design o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seizing it, by exacting from several persons an oath to serve him against all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ankind, not even excep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g his sovereign. That he had accused the king of u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing witchcraft to deprive him of his life: And that he had plainly betrayed a design to det<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rone the king, in taking an exemplification of the act of parlia∣ment passed during the u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rpation of Warwick, by which the crown was settled upon Clarence, in default of Henry VI. and the male issue of his body. The d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke denied every part of the charge, and offered to prove his innocence in single combat; but Edward himself being his accuser, and declaring himself well satisfied and convinced of the truth of the impeachment, no evidence was examined, and no member presumed to speak in behalf of this unfortunate prince, who was therefore pronounced guilty of the charge, and condemned to die as a traitor. The sentence was not immediately executed; and in all pro∣bability his life would have been spared, had not the k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng's indignation been kept up by the artful intrigues of the queen and Gloucester, and his apprehen∣sion aroused by a ridiculous prophecy; implying that the name of his successor should begin with a G. which was applied to George duke of Clarence. Ne∣vertheless the ministry would not venture to execute the sentence without some further pretext, which, in order to procure, they employed one Roger Twynho, to present a petition to the house of commons against the duke of Clarence, for having <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed a jury to give a false verdict against his kinswoman An∣keret, la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e wife of William Twynho, esquire, whom he charged with having poisoned his d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tchess; in consequence of which verdict the said Ankeret had suffered an ignominious death. The parliament, having considered the merits of this petition, annulled the process, as having been unj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stly carried on by the influence of the duke of Clarence; and petitioned that the sentence against that prince might be executed without further delay. Even then they were afraid
<PB N="421" REF="4310"/>
to run the risque of popular resentment by a public execution; but he was im∣mediately dispatched in the Tower, having, according to some historians, been drowned in a butt of malmsey. Such was the end of George duke of Clarence, who left one son called Edward earl of Warwick, and a daughter who was after∣wards countess of Salisbury. The duke's death excited such a clamour among the populace, that the court thought proper to conceal the manner of his ex∣ecution, and gave out that he had died suddenly of grief and vexation: to convince the world that no violence had been used, his body was exposed in St. Paul's church; but this expedient was so stale, tha it served only to confirm the conjectures of the people, who did not scruple to exclaim with great vehe∣mence<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowe.

<P>During these transactions, the truce between Lewis and Maxi∣milian expiring, this last invaded Burgundy, where he made himself master of several places with great facility, on account of the affection of the inhabitants for the house of Burgundy; and, in all probability, he would have recovered the whole dutchy, had he been properly supplied by his father. Lewis was not so much afraid of any assistance he might receive from the emperor, as of his en∣gaging in alliance with Edward, which he employed all his arts to prevent. In the month of July he sent a plenipotentiary to London, to prolong the truce for an hundred years after the death of either party; and to engage for the annual payment of the fifty thousand crowns, while that treaty should remain in force. As the term which had been affixed for adjusting all differences between the two crowns was expired, the ambassador was likewise impowered to prolong it for three years; and Edward, appointing commissioners to treat with this envoy, the proposals of Lewis were embraced without hesitation, though the treaty was not concluded till the month of February in the following year. Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r.</NOTE> would have willingly seen the consummation of the marriage-contract between the dauphin and his daughter Elizabeth, before the other transaction should be finished; and sent two ambassadors to France to conclude that affair: but, by this time Lewis had some other match in view for the dauphin; and, as that prince was not yet eight years of age, he found an excuse for delaying the affi∣ancing ceremony. Yet, that Edward might not be chagrined at this procrasti∣nation, he payed part of the ransom of Margaret of Anjou, which he had en∣gaged to liquidate at different terms; and sent the bishop of Elna to London to offer security for the payment of the fifty thousand crowns, for the long term to which the treaty had been lately extended. The security which the prelate offered was the oath of Lewis, together with bonds of the bank of Medicis, and letters patent confirmed by the estates of France and the papal authority, denouncing excommunication in case of failure. Edward's conduct was now wholly influ∣enced by Lewis, or rather by his own ministers, whom that prince had corrupted. The French king, not contented with having diverted him from assisting the dutchess of Burgundy, proposed that they should share between them the do∣minions of that princess; and that Edward should have Flanders and Brabant. The proposal was accepted, on condition, that in exchange for these countries Lewis should cede Boulogne and some other places in Picardy to the king of England. This was an article however which the French king would never have performed; and indeed his design in proposing this partition was to amuse Edward, and engage him in a war with Maximilian, who might otherwise have
<PB N="422" REF="4320"/>
brought him over to his interest: but the English monarch was grown too in∣dolent to undertake any enterprize that required personal activity; and he exerted himself in nothing but in negotiations with foreign princes, whose friendship might secure his tranquillity.</P>

Notwithstanding the pacification with France, Edward agreed to a proposal of Maximilian, importing, That his infant son Philip should marry Anne, the third daughter of the king of England; and this convention was ratified by letters patent on both sides, in which the two princes engaged, that for the space of three years they should not, without the consent of each other, bestow their respective children in marriage. At the same time Edward projected another match between his fourth daughter Catherine, and John infant of Castile and Arragon, son of Ferdinand and Isabella; and sent am∣bassadors to Spain to manage the negotiation, which however proved ineffec∣tual. Tired at length of the delays which retarded the marriage of his eldest daughter, he appointed the lord Howard, and Thomas Langton, treasurer of the church of Exeter, as ambassadors extraordinary to demand of Lewis in a preremptory manner the performance of his promise; and that prince, with all his cunning, found it difficult to elude the pressing instances of these envoys. He had already destined the dauphin for the princess Margaret, the new-born daughter of Maximilian; but he did not think proper to avow his design, un∣til<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> he should be in a condition to baffle the resentment of Edward. In the mean time he still practised his dissimulation; and, as the lord Howard was in his in∣terest, found means to evade the purport of the embassy with general promises, and the punctual payment of the annuity. But, foreseeing that he should not be able to amuse Edward much longer, he resolved to employ his attention in a different manner. By his ambassador in Scotland he persuaded James III. to break the truce with England, and invade the territories of Edward. He found no difficulty in this negotiation, as James was wholly governed by three venal upstarts, whom he had raised from the dust, in contempt of his antient nobility, who were extremely incensed at his conduct. These ministers, being bribed with French gold, persuaded their master to enter into the views of Lewis; and he began to make preparations which plainly indicated a design against England.</P>

<P>Edward perceived his drift, and issued orders for levying an army for the defence of the kingdom; and now for the first time began to open his eyes to the perfidy and dissimulation of Lewis, against whom he vowed ven∣geance: but in the mean time he determined to combat him with his own wea∣pons<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> of fraud and artifice. He renewed and confirmed the treaty of alliance, which had subsisted between him and the late duke of Burgundy; and engaged to furnish Maximilian and Mary with a reinforcement of six thousand men; while the archduke obliged himself to pay fifty thousand crowns yearly to Edward, in case Lewis should withraw his pension. The marriage-contract between young Philip and the princess Anne of England was concluded, on condition that the nuptials should be solemnized as soon as the parties should be mar∣riageable; and that Edward should bestow one hundred thousand crowns as a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er upon his daughter.

His next care was to se∣cure his frontiers against the irruption of the Scots, and to employ certain emissaries to conclude an alliance in his name, with the earl of Ross lord of the Isles, who engaged to make a di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersion in his favour, should James attempt to invade England.

<P>The king of England was not very eager to march against this enemy, because he maintained a correspondence with the Scottish nobility, and knew that James would soon find it necessary to listen to terms of accommoda∣tion.

The treaty im∣ported, that the prince should marry, in case of her death before consumma∣tion, her younger sister Isabel, on condition that, of the male children of the marriage, the second should succeed to the dutchy of Bretagne; that if a son should be born to the duke in wedlock, he should espouse one of Edward's daughters; that, in case of war between the French king and the duke, Edward should assist the latter with three thousand auxiliaries; and that the duke should supply him with the same number in the like circumstances. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Immediately after this transaction, Alexander duke of Albany, bro∣ther of James king of Scotland, escaped from a castle in which he had been imprisoned at the instigation of the ministry; and repairing to London, im∣plored the protection of Edward.

He was cordially received by the king of England, who not only promised to gratify his revenge, but also flattered his ambition by un∣dertaking to raise him to the throne of Scotland. A private treaty was con∣cluded between them; in which Alexander assumed the title of king of Scot∣land, and promised to do homage to England for his crown.

This message produced a negotiation between Richard and the Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh nobi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, managed by the duke of Albany; and, after some dis∣putes, both sides agreed, that the citizens of Edinburgh should give security for the repayment of the money which James had received, provided the match should mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arry; that the castle of Berwick should be delivered to the English; that the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of Albany should be appointed regent of Scotland. The archbishop of St. Andrew's, the bishop of Dunkeld, the chancellor, and the earl of Ar∣gyle, obliged themselves to procure his pardon; and the duke promised to ac∣knowlege his brother as his sovereign, and take the oath of allegiance to him a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>new. This agreement being ratified, the duke of Gloucester marched back to England; and the duke of Albany restored his brother James to the exercise of his r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yalty, without stipulating any thing but an amnesty in his own favour. That prince, however, could not forgive him for the part he had acted: he resolved to seize the first opportunity of securing his person; and the duke, being apprized of his intention, retired to the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle of Dunbar, which he sur∣rendered to the English, after having renewed his former treaty with Edward: but, seeing no appearance of being succoured according to his expectation, he repaired to the court of Lewis, where he was accidentally killed by the splinter

<P>Now that the war with Scotland was terminated, Edward turned<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1483.</NOTE> all his attention towards the prosecution of the revenge he had vowed against Lewis; but the conjuncture was not so favourable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his design, as it had been before his rupture with James. Mary dutchess of Burgundy having died in consequence of a fall from her horse, her husband Maximilian retained so little credit with the Flemings, that he was obliged to let his children remain in the hands of the inhabitants of Ghent; and Lewis, by his artful insinua∣tions, obtained the consent of that people to the marriage of the dauphin with Margaret daughter of their deceased dutchess, to whom the counties of Artois, Burgundy, Maconnois, Auxerre, and Charolois, were assigned as a portion. This negotiation was so privately carried on, that Edward had not the least in∣timation of it, until the young dauphiness, about two years of age, arrived at Paris, where the ceremony of her betrothal was performed with great pomp and magnificence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Biondi.</NOTE></P>

<P>The king of England was equally astonished and incensed at this event, which he looked upon as an unpardonable affront offered to his family in the person of his daughter Elizabeth, who had for some time been distin∣guished by the appellation of Dauphiness, in which she was now supplanted by an infant. Edward did not consider that Lewis, on this occasion, had done no∣thing more than retort his own behaviour in the case of the lady Bona. He listened to the suggestions of his resentment only, which, however, he could not obey with any prospect of success; for he was now deprived of the assistance of the Flemings, who favoured Lewis; and the duke of Bretagne was oppressed with melancholy to such a degree, that he could no longer manage his own affairs. In spite of all these disadvantages, the king of England resolved to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentré.</NOTE> carry war into the bowels of France: he convoked a general assembly of his nobles, who approved of his resolution; and the whole nation rejoiced as much at the prospect, as if they had already obtained a victory.

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>IMmediately after the death of the fourth Edward, his son was proclaimed king of England by the name of Edward V. though that young prince, who was but just turned o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> twelve years of age, never received the crown, or exercised any function of royalty; so that the interval between the death of his father and the usurpation of his uncle, was properly an interregnum, during which the duke of Gloucester took his measures for wresting the crown from his nephew. Young Edward kept his court at Ludlow-Castle in Shropshire, under the direction of his uncle Anthony earl of Rivers, who had been appointed his governor. His uterine brother Sir Richard Gray enjoyed another great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffice about his person; Sir Thomas Vaughan was his chamb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rlain; and all the other posts of his houshold were filled with the queen's creatures. Notwith∣standing the ascendancy she had acquired over the late king, she had never
<PB N="427" REF="4370"/>
been able to prevail upon him to dismiss from his council some old officers and servants, who had adhered to him in all the vicissitudes of his fortune. These were well acquainted with her endeavours; and supposing their safety consisted in their union, formed a party for their mutual defence and support, as well as to oppose the measures of Elizabeth and her family. At the head of this party, were Henry Stafford duke of Buckingham, William lord Hastings, and Tho∣mas lord Stanley. The first was descended from a daughter of Thomas of Wodestoke duke of Gloucester, and son of Edward III. and possessed the of∣fice of lord high constable; the lord Hastings was chamberlain, and particu∣larly beloved by Edward IV. on account of his unshaken attachment and fide∣lity; and the lord Stanley was the representative of an antient family, and a nobleman of virtue and courage, devoted to the interest of his master. These three were considered as the chiefs of the antient nobility, in contradistinction to those who had been enobled by the queen's influence; and tho' their credit in the council was not equal to that of the Widevilles and Grays, they distinguished themselves with great spirit in the opposition, and the king had been often ob∣liged to interpose in their disputes. The duke of Gloucester would have been very much perplexed between these two parties, had he not possessed an un∣common fund of sagacity and dissimulation; for, in order to live upon good terms with the king, he was obliged to cultivate the good graces of his sister-in-law; and, in behaving respectfully to her, he ran the risque of disobliging the antient nobility, upon who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e assistance he in a great measure depended for the accom∣plishment of his designs: he therefore made his court in public to the queen; but, at the same time, engaged in private connexions with the duke of Bucking∣ham and his party. Edward, on his death-bed, had strongly recommended unanimity and coalition to the two factions: he had even proposed a reconciliation, to which they readily consented; and the ceremony was performed in his pre∣sence. The queen engaged for the earl of Rivers, who was absent, and her eldest son the marquis of Dorset embraced the duke of Buckingham and lord Hastings, with all the exterior marks of cordiality. The duke of Gloucester being then at York on his majesty's affairs, could not obstruct this accommo∣dation, which would have been very prejudicial to his interest, had the parties been sincere in their pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions. But, this was not the case.</P>

<P>As soon as Edward's eyes were closed, they forgot their mutual pro∣testations; and each faction exerted all its efforts to gain the advantage over the other, in securing the person of the young king, in whose name they might be able to govern the kingdom. The queen, upon the death of her husband, dispatched a messenger to her brother Rivers, with the tidings of that event, and a letter, in which she advised him to raise a body of troops in Wales, and conduct the new king to London, that he might be crowned immediately. On the other hand, the duke of Buckingham and the lord Hastings made the duke of Gloucester acquainted with his brother's death, and the queen's mea∣sures; and as the protectorship of the realm, of right belonged to him during the king's mino<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty, they exhorted him to claim his privilege, offering to pro∣vide a body of a thousand men well armed, which should be ready to march at his command. Richa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d desired they would meet him at Northampton, where they accordingly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mbled with a great number of their friends; and there, in a stu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrangue, he expatiated on the danger to which they would be ex∣posed,

Having thus prepared the mind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the audience for the execution of his purpose, they entered into a serious con∣sult<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion about the means for rendering themselves masters of the king's person;<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> T.

They resolved to appear extremely zealous for the interest of their new sovereign, that the queen might have no pretence for assembling or maintaining an army; that the duke of Gloucester should persuade her to dismiss the troops that were already levied; and, should his arguments succeed, endeavour to secure the king's person before his arrival in London. But, should the queen turn a deaf ear to his remonstrances, he determined to amuse her with negotiations, until he should be in a condition to oppose her designs in a more effectual manner.</P>
</DIV4>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>This plan being projected, Hastings returned to London, where he had acquired great popularity; and the duke of Gloucester wrote a letter of condolance to the queen, in which, after the warmest professions of friendship, regard, and loyalty, to her and his young sovereign, he exhorted her to use her best endeavours to banish all jealous animosity that might still subsist among the nobles; and to confirm the reconciliation which had been so lately, and so happily effected. He observed, that her levying troops for the defence of the king<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at a time when the whole nation seemed to breathe one spirit of loy∣alty and affection, might wake the jealousy and suspicion of those noblemen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

In order to prevent these calamities, he earnestly intreated her to disband her troops, that all the nobles of the kingdom might, without fear or suspicion, pay their respects to their young sovereign, and con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ibute with all their power towards the maintenance of the public tranquillity. The queen had no reason to doubt the sincerity of Gloucester, who had always treated her with the utmost deference, and manifested uncommon zeal for the interest of her children: she believed his letter was the effect of his loyalty and good sense. As he had not yet dropped the least hint of his intention to claim the administration, she followed his advice as the wholesome counsel of a friend; and, sent an order to Rivers to disband his forces, that they might not give umbrage to the nation.</P>

<PB N="429" REF="4390"/>
Young Edward was met by the dukes of Gloucester and Buckingham, in the neighbourhood of Northampton, which they had already secured with nine hun∣dred men; and they approached him with marks of the most profound regard and submission. Gloucester told him, that as the town of Northampton was crouded with strangers, his majesty would be more at his ease in Stony-Stratford, about twelve miles farther on the London road, where they would join him in the morning, and in the mean time pass the night at Northampton. His proposal being approved, they invited the earl of Rivers to make merry with them at their lodgings; and he accompanied them to Northampton, glad of this opportunity to cement the late reconciliation by his unreserved compliance. They spent good part of the night in seeming harmony, and mutual professions of friendship; but, next morning they ordered him to be put in arrest, and set out for Stony-Stratford, where they found the king ready to proceed on his jour∣ney. Before they quitted that place, they took occasion to quarrel with his uterine brother Sir Richard Gray, whom they accused of having, in conjunction with the marquis of Dorset, and the earl of Rivers, formed a design to make themselves masters of the king's person: they likewise affirmed, that the mar∣quis had seized the treasure of the late king, with which he was intrusted. Ed∣ward himself interposing on this occasion, said he would not pretend to justify the conduct of Dorset, with which he was unacquainted; but, that he would answer for his uncle Rivers, and his brother Richard, who had been always with him since his father's decease. The duke of Buckingham told his majesty, they were too cunning to make him acquainted with their schemes; and imme∣diately ordered his followers to take Sir Richard Gray, and Sir Thomas Vaughan, into custody. The king was conveyed back to Northampton; and the next day, the prisoners were sent to the castle of Pontefract, notwithstand∣ing the intreaties and tears of Edward, which flowed in great abundance; tho' they still treated him with all the exterior marks of the most respectful submission.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>The queen was no sooner informed of these proceedings, than she com∣prehended the whole scheme of the duke of Gloucester, and looking upon her brother and two sons as lost, fled for refuge to the sanctuary in Westminster, with the duke of York, who was about nine years of age, the marquis of Dor∣set, and the rest of her children. The lord Hastings having received an ac∣count of the transaction at Northampton, repaired immediately to the house of the archbishop of York, to whom he communicated these tidings; assuring him at the same time, that no harm was intended to the king, to whom indeed, he was sincerely attached, without knowing the designs of Gloucester. The archbishop arose immediately from his bed; and, tho' it was midnight, went to visit the queen, whom he found sitting on the floor in the utmost agony of distress, deploring the fate of her children. The prelate endeavoured to con∣sole her with the assurances of Hastings; but, she could derive no comfort from any thing which came from that quarter. Then he protested, that if her enemies should be wicked enough to take away the life of the king, he would forthwith crown the duke of York; and as a pledge of his sincerity, he left the great seal in her hands: but afterwards reflecting, that he ought not to have parted with that mark of the late king's confidence, he desired it might be sent back, and she complied with his request. Mean while, the news of the affair
<PB N="430" REF="4400"/>
at Northampton filled the whole city of London with tumult and consterna∣tion; and a great number of the citizens took to their arms, without knowing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowe.</NOTE> what would be the consequence of Gloucester's conduct. But, their fears were appeased by the lord Hastings, who assured them, that the king was in no danger; and that Rivers and Gray had been apprehended for a conspiracy against the lives of the dukes of Gloucester and Buckingham; but that they would be fairly tried by the laws of their country.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>In a few days after this disturbance, the king was brought to Lon∣don, which he entered amidst the acclamations of the people, accompanied by the duke of Gloucester, who rode behind him bare-headed, and a great num∣ber of noblemen, who seemed zealously attached to his majesty's person. He was conducted to the bishop's palace, as a place of safety, under the protection of the citizens; and this mark of confidence, together with the respect which was paid to the person of the king, intirely dissipated those suspicions which the affair of Northampton had produced. Immediately after the rejoicings which were made on the king's arrival, the duke of Gloucester convoked a great council of the nobility, to regulate the administration; and these being chiefly composed of his own friends, or such as hated the queen's family, he was declared Protector of the King and Kingdom; tho' the council on this occasion us<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rped a prerogative which resided in the parliament alone. As soon as Richard found himself vested with this high office, he deprived the arch∣bishop of York of the great seal, which he gave to the bishop of Lincoln; and filled with his own creatures all those places which had been occupied by the queen's adherents. Then he proposed in council, that a deputation should be sent to desire the queen would allow the duke of York to attend his brother, and be present at his coronation. He observed, that Elizabeth's retreat into the sanctuary implied a distrust, which might kindle jealousies, and revive fac∣tions, to the manifest prejudice of the nation: that the circumstance of York's remaining in the asylum, while his brother received the crown, would disgrace the government in the eyes of foreign potentates: and that, in all probability, the queen's design was to escape from the sanctuary, and raise a flame in the kingdom, on pretence of defending her second son from violence. It was therefore, his opinion, that the archbishop of Canterbury should endeavour to persuade the queen to part with the duke of York; and that, should she refuse to comply in this particular with the desire of the council, the duke of York should be taken from her by force. The archbishop undertook to persuade her to compliance; but vehemently opposed the proposal for violating the sanc∣tuary, which had been so long kept sacred. The duke of Buckingham in∣veighed against the abuse of sanctuaries, and seconded the opinion of the pro∣tector, which was espoused by all the rest of the council, the ecclesiastics<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> excepted.</P>

<P>The cardinal archbishop being sent as deputy from the council to the queen, employed all his eloquence in vain, to persuade her that she ought to part with the duke of York; and finding her inflexible, plainly told her, that a re∣solution was taken to withdraw him by force from the sanctuary. The hapless mother, terrified at this declaration, imparted to the cardinal her suspicions of Gloucester, whom she taxed with a design upon the crown, which he could not accomplish without having both her sons in his power. The archbishop, who
<PB N="431" REF="4410"/>
never dreamed of Richard's ambition, took umbrage at the queen's insinua∣tions; and told her with great warmth, that her suspicions were injurious to the character of a prince who had nothing more at heart than the interest of his sovereign, as well as to the honour of the nobility and prelates in council, who could not be so wicked as to concur in any such treasonable design. He said that, without their concurrence, the protector would find such a scheme impracticable; tho' he was fully persuaded in his own mind, that no thought of that nature ever entered the breast of the duke of Gloucester. The good cardinal was really convinced of the protector's integrity; therefore his dis∣course was the more emphatic, and had the greater effect upon Elizabeth, who began to abate in her apprehension, tho' not so much, but that in parting with her son, she shed a torrent of tears, and underwent the most violent agi∣tation of sorrow. At length, after having embraced him with all the eagerness of maternal affection, heightened by the fear of losing the beloved obj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct for ever, she delivered him into the hands of the archbishop, by whom he was con∣ducted to the protector; and Richard received him with all the marks of p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rental tenderness, desiring he would look upon him as his guardian and father. The two young princes seemed extremely happy at meeting, and began to think their uncle Richard sincere in his professions of duty and friendship: but, this happiness was not of long duration; for, in a few days, they were conveyed from the bishop's palace to the Tower, from whence the kings of England used to ride in procession through the streets of London to their coronation at West∣minster; a custom which now furnished Gloucester with a pretext for securing his nephews in close custody.</P>

<P>It was at this juncture that Richard is said to have communicated his scheme to the duke of Buckingham, who was a nobleman without principle; and therefore easily engaged in the project of Gloucester, who promised to re∣compence his services with a grant of certain lands in Herefordshire, the late king's wardrobe, and a patent for rendering the office of constable hereditary in his family. The protector having secured Buckingham in his interest, re∣solved to rid his hands of the prisoners at Pontefract, whose death would de∣prive the royal family of their chief support. For this purpose he held consul∣tations with his friends, and found Hastings particularly pleased with the de∣sign of dispatching Rivers and Gray, who had done him many ill offices in the late reign. The lord Howard likewise assented to the scheme for the same rea∣son; and Sir Thomas Radcliffe governor of Pontefract, received instructions to put it in execution. He had already assembled five thousand men for the ser∣vice of Richard; so that having nothing to fear from the resentment of the people in the neighbourhood, he caused the earl of Rivers, Sir Richard Gray, and Sir Thomas Vaughan, to be beheaded, without any form of trial. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir T.

<P>In the mean time the duke of Gloucester endeavoured to engage in his service a great number of profligate persons of desperate fortunes, without fear, conscience, or any other principle of action than self-interest; who would execute his commands and directions, how wicked and cruel soever they might be, without remorse or hesitation. While he privately inlisted this band of desperadoes, he still maintained his dissimulation in the eyes of the world, af∣fecting to prepare for the coronation of his nephew, at which he summoned all gentlemen possessing forty pounds a year, to attend and receive the honour of

<P>These reports were disseminated in such an artful manner, that they g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned credit among the lower class of people, while they gave umbrage to those nob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emen who were attached to the family of the late king, and in particular<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> to lord Hastings, who was st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l intirely ignorant of Richard's real design.

by one of the members who was intirely devoted to his interest. This was his friend and confident Catesby; but, he little dreamed that this man betrayed him, and that such was the price by which he purchased the confidence of the protector. The lord Stanley and his collegues allowed themselves to be con∣vinced by the assurances of Hastings, whose intelligence they preferred to their own observations; and thus neglected the opportunity which never recurred.</P>

<P>Mean while, Richard thought it was now high time, either to make a convert of Hastings to his views, or to destroy him at once: for this purpose he employed Catesby to sound that nobleman, touching his opinion of the pro∣tector's right, which happened at that time to be the common subject of conver∣sation. Hastings not only refuted all the suggestions concerning the bastardy of Edward and his children; but assured Catesby, that he would with all his interest, and even his heart's blood, support the young princes against all their enemies. This declaration was immediately reported to the protector, who being extremely desirous of engaging Hastings in his design, directed Catesby to try him once more, and even hint the project which was formed for the exclusion of his nephews. Catesby, in this second conversation, found him<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian.</NOTE> more than ever determined to oppose any enterprize that should be formed against his master's children; and Richard, for that very reason, devoted him to immediate death. He repaired in the morning to the council in the Tower, where he behaved with remarkable affability to the members, and after some stay withdrew, desiring them to continue their deliberations, and give the last orders touching the ceremony of the coronation, which had been too long de∣layed. In about an hour after his departure, he returned with a frowning aspect, biting his lips, and exhibiting all the marks of internal agitation. After some pause, <Q>“My lords, (said he) what punishment do those deserve who have con∣spired against my life?”</Q> The whole council was confounded at this question; and the lord Hastings replied, in the name of the rest, that whoever was guilty of such a crime ought to be punished as a traitor. <Q>“It is no other (cried Rich∣ard) than that sorceress my sister-in-law, with her accomplices.”</Q> Before his hearers had time to recollect themselves from the fear and astonishment which this prelude produced, he bared his left arm which was withered, and present∣ing it to the council, <Q>“Behold, (said he) what that sorceress, and the wretched Shore have done by the power of their incantations! they have reduced this arm to the condition in which you now see it; and the rest of my body would have shared the same fate, if, by the singular protection of heaven, their in∣famous practices had not been discovered.”</Q> These words redoubled their amaze∣ment and terror, as they well knew his arm had been always in that shrivelled condition; and as they were fully persuaded, that if the queen had formed any such design, she would never have communicated it to Jane Shore, who had been the concubine of her husband, and now lived on the same footing with the lord Hastings, who was the queen's professed enemy. This nobleman could not help expressing his doubts about the truth of the information, by saying, if they were guilty, they deserved to be punished. <Q>“How! (cried the protector with great emotion) do'st thou answer me with an If, as if I had forged the accusation? I tell thee they have plotted against my life, and thou thyself art one of their accomplices.”</Q> So saying, he struck the table twice, and im∣mediately the hall was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illed with armed men; then, turning to Hastings, he
<PB N="$34" REF="4440"/>
said, "I arrest thee for the crime of treason." "Who, me, my lord!" re∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied that un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortunate nobleman: "Yes, thee, thou traitor," exclaimed the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ector, and ordered him to be seized by the soldiers. This arrest occasioned a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umult in the apartment, during which one of the soldiers attempted to cleave the head of lord Stanley with a battle-ax, on pretence of keeping the peace, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e missed his aim; and Stanley, by creeping under the table, saved his life at the expence of a dangerous wound. Nevertheless, he was arrested, toge∣ther with the archbishop of York, and the bishop of Ely: but as for Hastings, Richard was so bent upon his de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ruction, that he swore he would not dine, until hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> head should be severed from his shoulders; so that he had just time to confess himself to the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t priest that could be found, and then was beheaded on a log of timber.</P>

<P>Richard, knowing how much Hastings was beloved by the citizens of London, thought it necessary to use some pretext for this precipitate execu∣tion, and sent a me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>age to the mayor and aldermen, desiring to see them im∣medi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly. In the mean time he and Buckingham cased themselves up in rusty armour; and when the magi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>racy of London repaired to the Tower, in obe∣dience to his message, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e told them that the lord Hastings and some others h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spired against his life. He said he had not been informed of their design till ten in the morning, when the proofs appeared so plain, that the king and cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cil thought it absolutely necessary to execute Hastings without delay, as they understood a great number of people were ready to rise in his favour; that, in such a pressing emergency, he was fain to put on the first armour he could find, for the security of his person; and that he had sent for them to be witnesses of the truth, that they might inform the people, and prevent or ap∣pea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the tumults which ill-designing persons might raise in the city. The mayor and aldermen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw through the pretext: they durst not, however, signify<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Th.

Imme∣diately after this conference, a proclamation was published in the king's name, d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>laring that, as the lord Hastings had entered into a conspiracy to seize his majesty's person, and slay the protector and the duke of Buckingham, that he might govern the realm according to his own pleasure, the king, for the prevention of this wicked design, had, by the advice of his council, punished him without delay: that no person was eve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more deserving of the death of a tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itor th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Hastings, who had advised the late king to take so many fatal steps contrary to the liberty and privileges of the people: that he had been the con∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctor and companion of Edward's debauchery: and that he had spent the last <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight with Jane Shore, the accomplice of all his crimes, and of that in parti∣cular for which he suffered. This proclamation contained many other asper∣sions calculated to diminish the affection which the people had always expressed for lord Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tings, and anticipate their compassion; but it did not produce the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired effect. Jane Shore being apprehended and brought before the council, the duke of Gloucester accused her of having practised witchcraft, and entered into the conspiracy of Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings against his life. But she made her innocence appear so plain, that they could not, with any shadow of justice, condemn her upon this accusation: then she was prosecuted for the irregularities of her life, which she could not deny; and being delivered to the eccle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iastical jurisdiction, was condemned to do public penance in St. Paul's church, and to walk in pro∣cession

<P>Those executions at London and Ponte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ract, without form of process, together with the imprisonment of the archbishop of York, the bishop of Ely, and the lord Stanley, left the people no reason to doubt but that the protector had a design upon the crown; and the whole kingdom was filled with conster∣nation. This was a juncture at which he resolved to manifest his intention; but, as he desired to have the approbation of the Londoners, he cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lted with his confident the duke of Buckingham, about means for procuring this advan∣tage. They resolved to redouble their industry in persuading the people that the children of Edward were bastards, on the supposition that those whom their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aries could not convince, would be deterred from attempting to undeceive their neighbours. Doctor Ralf Shaw, the mayor's brother, preached a ser<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on at St. Paul's Cross, in which he not only enlarged upon Edward's previous marriage with Elizabeth Lucy, which rendered his other children illegitimate, but also expatiated upon the bastardy of Edward himself and his brother Clarence, who he affirmed were begotten by persons whom the dutchess of York admitted to her bed in the absence of her husband: then he made a transition to the duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loucester, whom he represented as the true son of York, whom he perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esemb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in his features as well as in his virtues, and poured forth an extrava∣gant panegyric on this prince, during which he int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded to have presented himself to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ople, in hope that, moved by the cloquence of the preacher, they would have sal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted him as king. The duke, however, did not arrive un∣til the doctor had exhausted his encomium, and began to discuss another sub∣ject. Nevertheless, seeing the protector approach, he repeated his praise with the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulsome exaggeration, while Richard walked through the croud to his place. But, instead of hearing the acclamation of "Long live king Richard!" he saw the audience hang their heads in profound silence, detesting the ven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lity of the preacher, who for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eited all his popularity by this shameful prostitu∣tion of his talent, and concealed himself in retirement, where he soon died of sorrow and remorse.</P>

<P>Shaw's sermon having been so unfavourably received, the duke of Buckingham, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amed for his elocution, undertook to harrangue the people on the Tuesday following at Guildhall; there the aldermen and com∣mon council being assembled by the lord mayor, the duke resumed the topics which doctor Shaw had handled so unsuccessfully. He told them, the lords in council and commons of the kingdom, had declared that no bastard should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it upon the throne of England, and insisted upon the crown's being adjudged to the duke of Gloucester, the only son of the late duke of York: he said there was reason to fear that magnanimous prince would reject the offer; but he hoped that if all the people, especially the citizens of London, would unite in their sollicitations, Richard might be persuaded to bear the weighty bur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen of government, which was too heavy for an infant's shoulders. He therefore de∣sired, in his own name, and that of the council, they would declare their opi∣nion; and here he paused, in expectation of hearing them exclaim <Q>“King Ri∣chard! King Richard!”</Q> But, to his great surprize, an universal silence prevailed. He repeated his harrangue with some variation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and still they con∣tinued mute and mclancholy. He then expressed his displeasure to the mayor,
<PB N="$36" REF="4460"/>
who told him, that the people were not used to be harrangued by any person but the recorder, who was the city orator. This officer being ordered to speak, on the same subject, recapitulated all that the duke had said; and concluded with desiring they would answer pos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tively, whether o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not they would have the duke of Glouce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter for their king. A confused murmur ran through the mul∣tit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de; and some of the duke's dome<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tics, having insinuated themselves among the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oud, cri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> "Long live king Richard!"

Richard pretended to be terrified at such a concourse of pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ple, as if he had thought they came with some sinister design upon his person<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and when at length Buckingham prevailed upon him to give them audience, he came forth with all the marks of terror and distrust. He affec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat surp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> proposal, which he declined, observing that he loved his brother's chil∣dren above all the crowns in the world: though he considered their address as a proof of their affection, which he should never forget. He exhorted them to live quie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y under the sovereign to whom they owed their obedience; and he p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omised for himself that he would, to the best of his power, advise his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>phew to govern in such a manner as to render his people flourishing and happy. The duke of Buckingham, appearing very much dissatisfied with this answer, de∣clared, that the people were unanimously resolved that none of Edward's chil∣dren s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould sit upon the throne; and that, if he would not receive the crown, they should be obliged to offer it to some other person. This declara<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>io<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> softened the protector into compliance. He told them, that since they were determined to reject the children of Edward, he was contented to accept the crown, which was undoubtedly his lawful inheritance, though he r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceived it with more pleasure, as the free gift of a free people. This condescension in Ri∣chard was applauded with loud acclamations. Next day he repaired to Westminster-Hall, where, placing himself in the royal seat, he made a speech to the audience, and gave the judges a strict charge for the due administration of ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tice.</P>

<P>This farce being acted with all imaginable success, the duke of Glou∣cester was proclaimed king of England and France, by the name of Richard III. on the twenty-second day of June, and the sixth day of July fixed for the ce∣remony o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his coronation, which he deferred till that time, in expectation of being reinforced by five thousand men from the north, as he did not much confide in the attachment of the Londoners.

<P>Richard now seemed secure from all oppositi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. There was not a nobleman in the kingdom who had intere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> enough to raise the least dist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣bance, except those who were intirely devoted to his interest. The queen dow∣ager, with her five daughters, and her brother the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rquis of Dorset, still re∣mained in the sanctuary. Sir Richard Wideville lived in concealment; while Edward V. and his brother the duke of York continued close prisoners in the Tower, the government of which was conferred on Sir Richard Brackenbury, on whose <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idelity Richard placed the greatest dependence. Nevertheless, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he might strengthen his power with foreign alliances, and prevent his enemies from receiving any assistance abroad, he sent Bernard de la Force as his ambas∣sador into Castile, to renew the antient alliance with Ferdinand and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sabe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a. He appointed commissioners to treat with France about certain infractions of the truce, that it might be renewed and confirmed; he vested Thomas Hut∣ton with full power to prolong the truce with Francis II. duke of Brittany; and this ambassador received instructions about a new treaty with that prince, touching his delivering up the earl of Richmond. <NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.</NOTE></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>These measures being taken, Richard is said to have compa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed the death of his two nephews in the Tower; and, in order to avoid the suspi∣cion of being concerned in this tragedy, to have made a progress through se∣veral counties, on pretence of reforming the abuses which had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pt into the administration of justice. In the course of this circuit he resided some time at Gloucester, which he affected to favour as the place from which he d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rived his title. He was accompanied by the duke of Buckingham, who now seemed to think his services could never be sufficiently recompenced, and was become so arrogant, that the king found it necessary to humble his pride. When reso∣lutions of this kind are taken, opportunities are never wanting. Richard af∣fected
<PB N="438" REF="4480"/>
to treat him superciliously, and even to refuse some little favours he had occasion to ask; for, with regard to the estate of Hereford, which some hi∣storians have made the cause of this difference, it appears, by a grant of Richard, mentioned by Dugdale, that the duke had actually received all the lands he could have reasonably claimed, as belonging to that family from which he was descended. In all probability therefore, he took umbrage at some other re∣pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se or mortifying slight; and having obtained permission to go and regulate his domestic affairs, retired in disgust to his castle of Brecknock. After his departure, the king proceeded to the execution of the scheme he had projected for making away with his nephews in the Tower. He had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded Brakenbury the governor upon this subject; and finding him too conscientious to be con∣cerned in the perpetr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of such a cruel murder, he employed Sir James Tyr∣rel, who had acted as assassin-general during the reign of Edward IV. under the title of vice-constable, by virtue of a commission, impowering him to take cog∣niz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of all cases of treason; and, upon a bare inspection of the fact, see justice immediately executed upon the criminal, without noise, form of trial, or appeal. This murdering commission was renewed by Richard; and Tyr∣rel, having received his instructions, found access to the Tower, where he is s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to have taken away the lives of the two innocent princes, by the hands of two ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ians, who smothered them in their beds, and buried their bodies under <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stair-case. This is the account given by Sir Thomas More, which ought to be read with caution, because written in the subsequent reign, when every hi∣storian and writer endeavoured to insinuate himself into the favour of Henry, by bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckening the character of his predecessor. True it is Tyrrel is said to have con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssed the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct, when he was arrested for treason against Henry; but very little dependence ought to be pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced on extorted confessions. At this period, the two young princes certainly disappeared; and, in the reign of Charles II. the workmen employed in repairing that part of the Tower, found the bones of a small human skeleton, which were interred in Westminster-Abbey, as the re∣mains of those two unhappy princes. If they were put to death at this juncture, Richard must have acted from mere wantonness of barbarity; for his throne seemed to be strongly established, the whole kingdom was quiet, all the parti∣sans of Edward's children were crushed and ruined, and the children themselves declared illegitimate. Perhaps young Edward, who was of a weakly constitu∣tion, died of grief and terror, with which he certainly was overwhelmed from the moment of his deposition; and his brother the duke of York was con∣veyed beyond sea, where he lived some time in obscurity, and afterwards ap∣peared as a pretender to the English crown. Even this conjecture is attended with material objections. Had Edward died of a natural death, Richard would have found his account in publishing his fate to the world, and honouring the body with a magnificent funeral. If the duke of York had escaped into Flan∣ders, his aunt the dutchess of Burgundy would naturally have owned him as such from the beginning, that there might be no doubt of his birth and quality in the sequel, when an opportunity should offer to assert his pretensions. After all<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when we consider the sanguinary disposition of Richard, and the mysterious disappearance of the two princes, we cannot pretend to acquit him of the im∣putation which hath been fixed upon his memory; notwithstanding all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ains which have been taken to gild over his character, by Buck, who was in
<PB N="439" REF="4490"/>
all respects a most despicable historian, and seems to have commenced the pane∣gyrist of Richard, because one of his ancestors was engaged in the service of that inhuman tyrant. We are told by Sir Thomas More, that although Richard expressed great joy when Tyrrel gave him to understand his order was executed on the two princes, he was afterwards haunted by the furies of re∣morse; that he often started from his sleep in the utmost trepidation; that he frequently rolled his eyes, bit his lip, and fumbled with his dagger, exhibiting in his countenance and demeanour all the marks of terror and distrust.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>It must be owned however that the king, in his progress, administered justice with great impartiality; and, by an unwearied attention to the interest of his subjects, seemed bent upon making an attonement for the blood through which he had waded to the throne. From Gloucester he repaired to York, where he had the satisfaction of receiving Geoffry de Sasiola, ambassador from Spain, whom Ferdinand and Isabella had sent on purpose to renew the antient alliance between Castile and England. He was so well pleased to find himself<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> acknowledged by that princess, who was descended from the house of Lan∣caster, that he knighted and caressed the ambassador: he wrote very affec∣tionate and respectful letters to their catholic majesties, and even to their ministers. While Richard resided at York he was a second time crowned in the cathedral of that city; and his son, a boy ten years of age, was created prince of Wales with the usual solemnities. Here too he received the tidings of the death of Lewis XI. king of France, who was succeeded by his only son Charles VIII. a minor, under the guardianship of his sister Anne, wife of Pe∣ter de Bourbon, lord of Beaujeu: but the duke of Orleans, as first prince of the blood, disputed the regency with her; and this contest produced such troubles in the French court as hindered the renewal or confirmation of the truce with England, which Richard eagerly sollicited.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>While the king enjoyed these events at York, the duke of Bucking∣ham brewed a storm against him, big with danger and expectation. That no∣bleman, who was naturally loud, imperious, and indiscreet, had not spent many days at Brecknock, when his discontent and hatred towards Richard were perceived by his prisoner, Morton bishop of Ely, a prelate of singular pene∣tration and address. He had formerly been a zealous partisan of the house of Lancaster, but yielded to the torrent at the accession of Edward, who found him useful in his affairs, and appointed him a member of his council. He still retained the warmest inclinations for the Lancastrian interest; and perceiv∣ing the resentment of Buckingham, insinuated himself into his confidence, by reviling Richard, whom he detested as a tyrant and a ruffian, who, not con∣tented with having shed the best blood of the nobility, and usurped the crown, had now crowned his inhumanity with the murder of the two innocent princes. Buckingham, in the transports of his passion, denounced vengeance against this monster of barbarity and ingratitude; and Morton is said to have advised him to claim the crown in his own right, as descended from Anne, daughter of Thomas de Wodestoke, earl of Gloucester, and third son of the third Edward; but the duke foreseeing that in such a case the friends of Henry earl of Rich∣mond would join the house of York against him, declined following the bishop's advice, and declared in favour of that nobleman, who was the true heir of the house of Lancaster. He proposed that Henry should espouse Elizabeth, the
<PB N="440" REF="4500"/>
eldest daughter of Edward IV. and by this alliance reunite the two houses in his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour. The bishop relished the expedient, as a scheme consormable to justice, that in all probability would effectually extinguish the embers of those civil wars by which the kingdom had been so long har<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assed and depopulated. Henry earl of Richmond was the son of a Welshman, as we have already ob∣served; but his mother Margaret was daughter of John de Beaufort, duke of Somerset, and grandson of John of Ghent, d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of Lancaster. Margaret's father, dying without male <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sue, his younger brother Edmund succeeded to his title; but he and all his posterity being destroyed in the civil war. Mar∣garet and her son were the only surviving branches of that family, and conse∣quently the heirs of the house of Lancaster. Nevertheless, their title was liable to one great objection: They were descended from Catherine Rouet, who had been conc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bine to John of Ghent; and although her children were declared legitimate by act of parliament, and capable of inheriting titles and estates, they were not allowed to assume the name of Plantagenet; nor did the act of their legitimation extend to their being rendered capable of succeeding to the throne: even supposing their right had extended so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, they could have hardly pre∣tended to come in competition with the descendants of the duke of Lancaster by his lawful marriage; who amounted to ten or twelve different princes and princesses in Spain, Portugal, and Germany. These however seemed to be excluded from the crown, in the opinion of the English; and Richmond's right was tacitly acknowledged by the repeated efforts which Edward IV. and Richard made to secure his person. Had not the interest of this nobleman been very great, and his title espoused by all the friends of the house of Lan∣caster, a man of Buckingham's ambition would in all probability have set up for himself. At present he seems to have been actuated intirely by a spirit of revenge against Richard, though he coloured it with a more plausible pretext; for we can hardly believe that a person of his character would engage in such a dangerous scheme, on a more laudable principle.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXI.</HEAD>
<P>Be that as it will, he and the bishop, after divers consultations, con∣cluded that the whole hope of success in this enterprize depended upon the marriage between Henry and Elizabeth; and that they ought to secure this alliance, as a necessary preliminary to all their other measures. For this pur∣pose they resolved to communicate the scheme to the old countess of Rich∣mond, that she might take the first opportunity to make her son acquainted with the design, and endeavour to obtain the consent of the queen dowager. The bishop, being intimately acquainted with Reginald Bray, one of the domes∣ticks belonging to the countess, sent for him to Brecknock, where he was en∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sted with the secret, and undertook to engage his mistress in the design. This man was no sooner returned to the countess with his embassy, than the bishop desired the duke would permit him to retire to his diocese; but Buck∣ingham excusing himself by saying such permission would rouse the suspicion of Richard, the prelate found means to escape, and crossed the sea to Flanders, from whence he wrote an apology to the duke, encouraging him to proceed with his undertaking, and assuring him he could serve the cause much more effectually on the continent than in England. Morton, knowing the duke's heat and precipitation, was afraid of being personally involved in some rash project, that might have cost him his life before their design could be brought
<PB N="441" REF="4510"/>
to maturity; and therefore he withdrew from his habitation. In the mean time the countess of Richmond, being informed of their plan, sent back Bray to the duke to signify her approbation and gratitude; and assure him that she would, without loss of time, endeavour to obtain the consent of the queen dowager to the projected marriage. She did not doubt of meeting with suc∣cess in this negotiation, as the queen still continued in the sanctuary at West∣minster, deploring the untimely death of her two sons, and pouring forth im∣precations against their inhuman butcher. The countess employed her physi∣cian, whose name was Lewis, to visit Elizabeth in the way of his profession, and make her acquainted with the design which was formed in behalf of her children against the inhuman usurper; and she received the intimation with ea∣gerness and joy. She assured him that all the friends of her late husband should join the earl of Richmond, but in the mean time she insisted upon that noble∣man's engaging by oath to marry her daughter Elizabeth, or her younger sister Cecilia, in case the other should die before the consummation of the marriage.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="22" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXII.</HEAD>
<P>A good understanding being thus established between the queen dowager, the countess of Richmond, and the duke of Buckingham, each in particular began to engage a number of adherents; and they succeeded even beyond expectation. Richard had by his cruelty rendered himself odious to the nation in general, and almost all the partisans of the house of York were incensed against him on account of the murder of the two princes. All the Lancastrians joyfully embraced a project that tended to re-establish a prince of that house on the throne of England; and moderate people, who had nothing in view but the good of their country, could not but favour a design, the suc∣cess of which would put an end to those civil dissensions with which the realm had been so long afflicted. The duke of Buckingham, as chief of the enterprize, employed his friends in Wales to enlist men privately, that he might be able to assemble an army all at once, when it should be found necessary to declare their intention: at the same time he entered into engagements with the gentle∣men of Dorsetshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall, who promised to levy troops, and join the earl of Richmond at his landing. This was likewise his own de∣sign; while others of his adherents were instructed to excite insurrections in different parts of the country, in order to divide Richard's forces, and distract his attention. The marq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is of Dorset, who had lately quitted the sanctuary, his brother Sir Richard Wideville, the bishop of Exeter, his brother Sir Ed∣ward Courtney, and several other persons of distinction, engaged in this asso∣ciation. The countess of Richmond sent two messengers to her son in Britanny, by different ways, to inform him of the resolution which had been taken in his favour, and the conditions on which he was invited to land in England. He then resided at Vannes, where he had been kept several years a kind of pri∣soner at large, in consequence of the convention subsisting between the duke and the fourth Edward.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="23" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The earl was not more rejoiced at the steps which were taken in his favour by his friends in England, than embarrassed about the means of return∣ing in a suitable manner to his native country. He was not ignorant of the agreement between Edward IV. and the duke of Britanny, touching the con∣finement of his person; and he knew that Richard had made advances to the duke on the same subject: but, as he could not pretend to take the advantage of
<PB N="442" REF="4520"/>
his good fortune without the concurrence of that prince, he frankly com∣municated to him every circumstance of the plan, and sollicited his friend∣ship and assistance. He found the duke very very well disposed to favour his e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erprize. He had not engaged in any treaty with Richard, whom he detested for his tyranny, and inhuman disposition; and he had some pretensions to the earldom of Richmond in England, which his ancestors had possessed, and which he did not despair of retrieving, provided the earl should by his means ascend the throne of England. This is said to have been the principal article of their agreement, in consideration of which the duke engaged to assist<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gshed.</NOTE> him with troops and vessels. Henry having secured this point with the duke of Brittany, dispatched a messenger with letters to his mother, and the duke of Buckingham, informing them o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the progress he had made, and desiring they would be ready to receive him in the beginning of October. By these tidings all the conspirators were put in motion; and each individual repaired to the post assigned to him, in order to levy troops, or excite insurrections.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="24" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding all their precautions, these steps could not be taken with such secrecy as to elude the vigilance of Richard, who discovered that some plot was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed against him, tho' he was still ignorant of the quar∣ter from which the storm impended. He forthwith advanced from York to∣wards the centre of his kingdom; and issued orders into different parts, di∣recting the troops to be in readiness to march at the first notice. His reflexion <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon pointed out to him the duke of Buckingham as the author of those com∣motions, as he had retired from court in disgust; was the only nobleman in England, who by his genius, wealth, and influence, could form and execute any scheme of such importance; and the escape of the bishop of Ely bore all the marks of the duke's connivance. Alarmed by these suspicions, he sent for the duke to court, that he might consult him on some affairs of consequence; and Buckingham excused himself, on pretence of indisposition. The king be∣ing more and more confirmed in his conjectures, by this evasion, insisted upon seeing him, by a peremptory order that would admit of no apology; and to this the duke answered, that he did not choose to trust his person with his most inverterate enemy, on whom he neither could, nor would, for the future, place the smallest dependence. After this declaration, he knew there was no medium to be observed. He immediately assembled his troops, and began his march towards the western provinces, where the earl of Richmond intended to land, and where he expected to be joined by the rest of the confederacy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>Tho' Richard was not a little surprized to find the duke so well prepared, he had taken such precautions as enabled him to bring an army into the field without delay; and he appointed the rendezvous at Leicester, resolving to go in quest of the enemy, and engage him before he should be reinforced. He would have found it difficult<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> however, to prevent the junction of the con∣federates, had they not been kept asunder by an unforeseen accident. The duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngham advanced by long marches to the side of the Severne, in his way to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oin his friends in the counties of Devon and Dorset; but, the river had overflowed its banks in such an extraordinary manner, as to deluge the whole adjacent country; so that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or six days, he could neither pass the stream, nor find subsistence in the place where he encamped. His Welsh followers, dispirited by the want of provision, the excessive rains, the intolerable fatigues to which they
<PB N="443" REF="4530"/>
were exposed, as well as by the inundation, which they looked upon as an unfa∣vourable omen, retired to their mountains, in spite of all his remonstrances and intreatries; and the desertion was so general, that he was left with one dome∣stic only. In this forlorn situation, he saw no other resource than that of con∣cealing himself, until he should be able to take other measures. He therefore re∣tired to the house of one Banister, who had lived in his service, and owed his all to the bounty of the duke and his father. Richard was no sooner informed of the dispersion of his enemies, than he published a proclamation, setting the price of a thousand pounds on the head of the duke of Buckingham; and Banister was such an ungrateful wretch, as to betray his master and benefactor for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake of this reward. He discovered him to the sheriff of Shropshire, who with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

He was conveyed to Shrewsbury, and earnestly desired he might be admitted into the king's presence; but, this was a favour he could not obtain: and he was immediately beheaded by Richard's order, without any form of process. His friends, who waited for his crossing the Severne, being informed of the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sertion of his Welsh troops, dispersed immediately. Some concealed themselves in the houses of their relations; others fled to sanctuaries; but, the greater part embarked for Brittany, and the marquis of Dorset was of that number.</P>

<P>While the duke of Buckingham thus hasted to destruction, Henry earl of Richmond, supposing that his affairs in England were still in a prosperous train, set <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail from St. Malo, in the latter end of October, with five thousand men, embarked in forty vessels, an armament with which he had been supplied by the duke of Brittany; but, his fleet was dispersed by a storm, which forced part of his ships on the coast of France, while the rest were driven back to the place from whence they had taken their departure. The ship in which the earl him∣self embarked, having weathered the storm, arrived at Pool in Dorsetshire, where finding the shore crouded with armed men, he would not land, but sent some persons ashore in the boat, to learn whether they were friends or enemies. The commander of the English troops told them, he belonged to the duke of Buckingham, who had sent him to that place to receive the earl of Richmond. But, whether Henry discovered them to be the militia of the country, assem∣bled by Richard's officers, or was determined against landing without the forces which had embarked in the expedition, he continued some days hovering on the coast, in hope of being joined by his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet; and, as none of his vessels appeared, he sailed back to Normandy, where he was informed of Buckingham's disaster. Then he returned to Brittany, where he found the marquis of Dorset, and the other refugees, who in some measure consoled him for his miscarriage, by assur∣ing him, that Richard was universally hated by his subjects; and that they would rise against him with the very first opportunity. Henry conceived a good omen from this information; and the duke of Brittany promising to con∣tinue his assistance, he resolved to make another attempt with all convenient ex∣pedition. In the mean time, he solemnly swore, on Christmas day, in the ca∣thedral of Rennes, that he would marry the princess Elizabeth; or, in case of her death, her younger sister Cecilia; and he no sooner took the oath, than all the English who were present, swore allegiance to him as king of England.</P>

<P>During these transactions in Brittany, Richard sacrificed a great number of victims to his vengeance; and among the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est, Sir Thomas St. Leger, who had married his own sister Anne, widow of the duke of Exeter.

All opposition being thus quelled, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ch. 1484.</NOTE> king called a parliament, which met in the month of January; and, as none of the members durst contradict his will, an act was passed, declaring Edward's children bastards, and confirming the pretended right and irregular election of Richard. They likewise brought a bill of attainder against Henry earl of Richmond, and all his adherents, comprehending all those who were concerned in the duke of Buckingham's conspiracy, except the countess of Richmond, against whom no information had been presented. Richard, however, desired her husband lord Stanley to keep a watchful eye over her conduct; and, in order to attach that nobleman still more firmly to his interest, he created him lord high constable of England, with authority over Ashton, who had by this time performed the service for which he was appointed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>When Richard thought he had, by these executions, intirely ex∣tinguished the conspiracy; Thomas Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton, whom he had sent ambassador to the court o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Brittany, on his return to England, gave him to understand that the design of the invasion still subsisted: that the duke had promised to continue his assistance to the earl of Richmond: and, that Henry and the English refugees held frequent conferences, to concert measures for the execution of their project. Richard, tho' he believed himself so much master in England, that no person would presume to take arms against his government, resolved to render him∣self still more secure by foreign alliances. He had already renewed the treaties with Spain and Portugal, and he now sent ambassadors to the archduke Maxi∣milian, governor of the Low Countries for his son Philip, who, by his mo∣ther, was, like the princes of Castile and Portugal, descended from the house<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> of Lancaster. The pretence of this embassy was to renew the commercial truce between Flanders and England; but, the ambassadors had instructions to en∣quire whether or not that court entertained any design upon the crown of Eng∣land, or had engaged in alliance with the pretender: at the same time, the king of England sent envoys to the court of France, to confirm and prolong the truce with that kingdom. As he knew the duke of Brittany was embarked in the interests of the earl of Richmond, he determined to exert his utmost en∣deavours, to detach him from the cause of that nobleman; and an accident presented him with a very favourable opportunity. The duke being old and infirm, was intirely directed by his treasurer Peter Landais, the son of a taylor, who used his credit with such insolence, as intailed upon him the hatred of all the Bretons. In the course of this very year, the nobility had entered into an association against him, and even attempted to seize his person in the duke's palace; but, their scheme miscarried, and they were declared rebels and trai∣to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s by means of the incensed favourite. Landais knowing he was the object of universal hate in his own country, thought it would be necessary to fortify
<PB N="445" REF="4550"/>
himself with some foreign assistances; and with this view sent ambassadors to Richard, who gladly listened to his proposals. A truce was concluded between England and Britanny; but by another private treaty, the king engaged to assist the duke with a thousand archers for the defence of his minister, who, in all probability undertook to deliver the earl of Richmond into the hands of Richard: at least he promised that Henry should have no further assistance from the duke his master.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>This affair being settled to the king's satisfaction, he turned his attention to James IV. of Scotland, whom, as a descendant of the house of So∣merset, he imagined a favourer of Richmond. With this prince he negotiated a truce for one year, and settled the contract of marriage between his niece Anne, daughter of the duke of Suffolk, and the duke of Rothsay, eldest son of the Scottish monarch. Richard's son, the prince of Wales, dying about<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> this period, he declared the young lady's brother, the earl of Lincoln, pre∣sumptive heir of the crown, and resolved that his declaration should be ratified by parliament. Over and above these precautions, he sent an embassy of obedience to pope Innocent VIII. who had just succeeded Sixtus IV. in the pontifical chair; and, in a little time after he had taken these salutary measures, Charles VIII. king of France, desired a safe-conduct for the ambassadors he intended for the court of London.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>As Peter Landais, minister of the duke of Bretagne, had no oc∣casion for the archers which had been stipulated in the treaty, Richard perceiv∣ed that he had nothing to expect from that quarter, unless he could indulge him with other advantages. He therefore, on pretence of prolonging the truce, entered into a new negotiation with the duke and his favourite, and is said to have offered very valuable rewards for the person of Henry; during whose life he could enjoy no internal quiet. The duke, by this time, was quite super∣annuated, and his intellects greatly impaired; so that in effect Landais acted as sovereign of Britanny; and to him Richard's chief attention was directed. The king of England is said to have granted letters patent, restoring to Francis II. duke of Bretagne, the earldom of Richmond and all its dependances: but with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentre.</NOTE> respect to Landais, the nature of the gratification which he expected is not so perfectly known. Certain it is, Richard was very liberal in his promises, but the other insisted upon having something more substantial; and, before the treaty was finished, the earl of Richmond was informed of the negotiation by Morton bishop of Ely, who, having spies in the court of England, understood that the king often conferred in private with the bishop of Leon, ambassador from the duke of Bretagne. Henry, alarmed at this intelligence, resolved to retire into France, and for that purpose secretly obtained a passport from king Charles; but, as he naturally supposed that Landais had employed emissaries to watch his motions, he found himself embarrassed about the means of accom∣plishing his escape. The duke of Bretagne had just recovered of a lethargy, during which his minister had negotiated with Richard; and the earl of Rich∣mond sent all his English friends and followers to congratulate that prince, in his name, on the re-establishment of his health, justly concluding that they would not suspect him of any design to retire while such a number of hostages remained at the court of Britanny. The scheme succeeded to his wish: being left almost alone at Vannes, he found an opportunity to withdraw in disguise,
<PB N="446" REF="4560"/>
accompanied by five persons; he immediately quitted the high road, and rode across the country through lanes and unfrequented paths, without halting, until he arrived at Angers, the capital of Anjou. Without such diligence he must have certainly been taken; for his escape from Vannes was no sooner known, than those who were employed to watch his conduct pursued him with such speed, that they arrived upon the frontiers in less than one hour after he had pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed the confines of Britanny. The duke, understanding that he had retired from apprehension of being betrayed by Landais, was incensed against his fa∣vourite, and allowed all the English in his dominions to join the earl, to whom he sent his compliments and proffers of service. From Angers Henry repaired to Langeais, where he met with an hospitable reception at the court of Charles, though it was still distracted by different factions; and here he was joined by the earl of Oxford, who had been imprisoned by order of Edward IV. in the castle of Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes in Picardy. Hearing in his confinement that the earl of Richmond laid claim to the crown of England, he had prevailed upon the go∣vernor of that fortress to declare for Henry, and now they went together to visit him at the court of France. The earl of Oxford was a considerable acces∣sion to his party; and several other noblemen in England sent him secret assuran∣ces that he might depend upon their service whenever they should find a proper opportunity to declare against Richard: among these was the lord Stanley, who had married the earl's mother; and on that account was so much suspected by the king, that he could not obtain leave to retire to his house in the country, until he had left his son at court as an hostage.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="31" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>Richard was at such pains to learn the nature of the plan which his enemies projected against him, that he at last discovered the most material circumstance, which was the union of the queen's friends with the partisans of the house of Lancaster, by means of Henry's marriage with Elizabeth. Rou∣sed at this intelligence he resolved to prevent a match which could not fail to shake the foundations of his government; and he saw no method so effectual as that of making Elizabeth his own confort. This would have appeared an impracticable expedient to any other person but Richard, as it was attended with three obstacles seemingly unsurmountable, before such a marriage could take effect: there was a necessity for removing his present wife; for obtaining the consent of the queen dowager, whose brothers and sons he had butchered; and for prevailing upon the pope to grant a dispensation for an incestuous mar∣riage between an uncle and a niece. He began the execution of this strange project by sending several civil messages to the queen dowager, importing that he wished for nothing so much as to live in a good understanding with her, that he might have an opportunity to give her convincing proofs of his friend∣ship. He owned she had met with cruel treatment, in order to attone for which he promised to assign a considerable pension for her subsistance; to bestow profitable employments on her two brothers, and to procure advantageous matches for her daughters. As he knew these advances would appear suspicious to the queen, he instructed his emissaries to ascribe them to the dictates of his conscience, which was disturbed by the remembrance of the wrongs he had done her family. They declared that his intention was to raise the pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cess Elizabeth to the throne, as death had deprived him of his own son; and that he would revoke the declaration he had made in favour of the earl of Lincoln. The
<PB N="447" REF="4570"/>
other part of his promise, touching the safety of the queen and her family, as well as the intended provision, he confirmed by a solemn oath, taken at an assembly of the lords spiritual and temporal.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="32" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>These promises and professions made an impression on the mind of the queen, who was heartily tired with being cooped up in a fanctuary, very ill provided with the necessaries of life; who loved her brothers with the warm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st affection, and who reflected that she and her daughters had nothing to expect but mischief and destruction, should she irritate the king by rejecting his offers. Swayed by these considerations, she not only went to court with her five daugh∣ters, where they met with a most gracious reception, but also wrote to her brother, the marquis o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dorset, to abandon the earl of Richmond, and return to Eng∣land, where he might depend upon Richard's generosity. The marquis, equally weak and ambitious, was so agreeably flattered with this prospect of the king's favour, that he withdrew privately from Paris, with design to return to England; but he was pursued and brought back by the adherents of Henry, who persuaded him to stay and share his fortune. Richard, having thus ac∣complished the most difficult part of his plan, began to contrive means for removing his wife, that he might be at liberty to espouse his niece Elizabeth; and whatever expedient he used, certain it is, she did not long survive her son the prince of Wales: if we may believe Buck, she died of grie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the loss of that young prince; but all the other historians alledge, that Richard killed her either with unkindness or poison; and thus she suffered the punishment which she in some measure deserved, for having thrown herself into the arms of the barbarian who had murdered her first husband the prince of Wales, son of Henry VI. at Tewkesbury.</P>

<DIV4 N="33" TYPE="section">

<P>The king professed the deepest affliction at the death of his con∣sort, who was interred with great pomp and magnificence; but, notwithstand∣ing his grief, she was hardly in her tomb, when he made proposals of marriage to his niece Elizabeth. She received his addresses with horror, and begged he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hall. Hollingshed.</NOTE> would never more speak to her on that subject; but he did not doubt of being able to vanquish her reluctance, though he laid aside his design until a more favourable opportunity should occur, as he did not think it would be politic to force her inclinations. Mean while, understanding that the governor of Hammes had revolted, he ordered the commander of Calais to reduce that fortress to his obedience; and his order was so expeditiously executed, that the earl of Oxford, who marched to its relief, could not reach the neighbourhood until after it had capitulated; the garrison, however, joined the earl of Rich∣mond. The king of England had equipped a squadron of ships to oppose the descent of Henry; but, the truce with Britanny having been prolonged for seven years, and France expressing very little inclination to assist his enemy, he thought the expence of a fleet altogether unnecessary, and ordered it to be laid up in the beginning of summer. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The earl of Richmond, eager to seize this opportunity, sollicited the French ministry for succours with such importunity, that they resolved to grant his request; not that they imagined his enterprize would be crowned with success, but they thought it was the interest of France to foment the di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sensions of England. They therefore engaged to supply him with two thou∣sand men, and vessels for transporting them to England, and even furnished
<PB N="448" REF="4580"/>
him with a sum of money; tho' they insisted upon his leaving hostages in<NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il. de Co∣mines.</NOTE> France, as a security for refunding the charges of this expedition. The earl, who had no great confidence in the marquis of Dorset, was glad of this occa∣sion to leave him at Paris, while he himself repaired to Rouen, where the troops were ordered to assemble. There he received the disagreeable news of the queen's death, and understood that Richard intended to marry his niece Eli∣zabeth, and bestow her sister Cecilia on one of his favourites. He forthwith called a council of his friends, to deliberate on these unfavourable tidings; and they advised him to marry the sister of Sir Thomas Herbert, a very powerful knight in Wales, whose interest would be a great acquisition. Henry relished the advice, and dispatched a member to Herbert with his proposal; but the passes were so guarded, that he could not execute his commission; and this was a very lucky disappointment for the earl of Richmond, who, if the alliance had taken place, would in all probability have lost the interest of Edward's family, and their adherents, who engaged in his cause meerly from the hope that he would unite the houses of York and Lancaster by his marriage with the princess Elizabeth. Henry, in a few days after his arrival at Rouen, received letters from England, inviting him to land in Wales, where he would find the people ready to take arms in his favour, together with a large sum of money which had been collected for his service. He was likewise given to understand, that the whole kingdom was discontented at the conduct and character of Ri∣chard; and that there could not be a more favourable juncture for Henry's landing, as the tyrant had made no preparations <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or opposing his descent.</P>

<P>Encouraged by this information the earl hastened his departure, and embarking with his troops at Harfleur on the last day of July, arrived on the sixth day of August in Milford haven in Wales. Next day he advanced to Haverford, where he was received amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants: from hence he dispatched an express to his mother, with an account of his ar∣rival, and intended march to London; then he sent intimation to his friends to join him upon his route, and set out for Shrewsbury, where he purposed to pass the Severne. Richard, being informed of his landing, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dered Sir Thomas Herbert to assemble the militia of Wales, and stop the earl's progress until he should be in a condition to march against him; but Herbert having been already gained over by Henry's friends, allowed him to pass unmolested. He was joined on his route by Sir Rees ap Thomas, the most powerful commoner in Wales, and a great number of gentlemen of that country; so that his army daily increased, and in a few day as he arrived at Shrewsbury, which he entered without opposition. Mean while a body of five thousand men was raised by the lord Stanley and his brother Sir William, on pretence of serving Richard; and they advanced to Litchfield, as if their design was to oppose the invader: but Sir William had a private interview with Henry, whom he assured of his bro∣ther's assistance, as soon as he could declare himself with any sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety to his son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hollingshed.</NOTE> the lord Strange, who was detained as an hostage by the tyrant.</P>

<P>Richard had by this time assembled his forces at Nottingham.

<PB N="449" REF="4590"/>
having taken his measures with the two brothers, continued his march to Lei∣cester, where he proposed to venture a decisive engagement. In the neigh∣bourhood of Tamworth he dropped behind his army, and in a fit of musing lost his way; so that he was obliged to lie all night at a village, without daring to ask the road, for fear of being suspected and falling into the hands of his enemies. Next morning he made shift to rejoin his army at Tamworth, where, finding his friends had been greatly alarmed at his absence, he told them he had gone to confer with some particular noblemen, who did not chuse to appear as yet in his behalf. That same day he privately visited the lord Stanley at Ather∣stone; and on the morrow, being informed that Richard had marched from Leicester to give him battle, he resolved to spare him one half of the way. On the twenty-second day of August, the two armies came in sight of each other, at Bosworth, which is rendered famous in history by the battle which ter∣minated the dispute between the houses of York and Lancaster. Richard's arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consisted of twelve thousand men well accoutred. The command of the van he conferred on the duke of Norfolk; and he himself took post in the centre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the crown upon his head, either as a mark of distinction, or a challenge to his adversary. The earl of Richmond drew up his troops, amounting to five thousand men ill armed, in two lines; the command of the first he gave to the earl of Oxford, while he himself conducted the other. Lord Stanley, who quitted Atherstone, took post in a piece of ground fronting the interval be∣tween the two armies; and his brother, at the head of two thousand men, stood facing him on the other side. Richard, suspecting Stanley's design, or∣dered<NOTE PLACE="marg">More.</NOTE> him to join his army, and receiving an equivocal answer, would have put his son to death, had not he been diverted from his purpose by the remon∣strances of his generals, who observed that such a sacrifice could be of no ad∣vantage to the royal cause, but would infallibly provoke Stanley and his brother to join the foe; though perhaps their intention was to remain neuter, and de∣clare for the victor. Richard was persuaded by this representation: but he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buck.</NOTE> committed a fatal error in leaving the two brothers at liberty to act as they should think proper. His army being equal in number to that of Richmond and the Stanleys, when joined together, he ought to have posted two bodies opposite to the brothers, with order to attack them if they should attempt to join the enemy, while he himself with the remainder might have given battle to Henry.</P>

<DIV4 N="37" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The two leaders having harrangued their soldiers, the earl of Richmond made a motion to the left, in order to avoid a morass that divided the two armies; and, by this prudent measure, not only secured his right flank, but gained another advantage, in having the sun at his back, while it shone full in the face of the enemy. Richard, seeing him approach, commanded the trumpets to sound; and the battle began with a general discharge of arrows, after which the king's army advanced to close combat. The lord Stanley, per∣ceiving that the duke of Norfolk extended his line to the left, in order to sur∣round the enemy, suddenly joined the earl of Richmond's right wing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in order to sustain the attack; and Norfolk, seeing this junction, made a halt to close his files, which had been too much opened for the extension of the line. The match being now pretty equal, the fight was renewed, though not with equal ardour on both sides. The king's troops seemed to act with reluctance,
<PB N="450" REF="4600"/>
and were, in all probability, dispirited by the conduct of the two Stanleys, not knowing but their example might be followed by others in the heat of the engagement: on the other hand, the earl of Oxford charged them with such impetuosity, as contributed to damp their courage, and fill their hearts with des∣po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dence. Richard, in order to animate them with his presence and example, advanced to the front of the battle: there perceiving his competitor, who had quitted the second line for the same purpose, he couched his lance, and, clap∣ping spurs to his horse, ran against him with such fury, that he killed his stan∣dard-bearer Sir William Brandon, father of Charles Brandon afterwards duke of Suffolk, and unhorsed Sir John Cheyney, an officer remarkable for his strength and prowess. Henry, though he did not seem very eager to engage such an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntagonist, advanced to meet him, and kept him at his sword's point, until they were parted by the soldiers, who interposed. While Richard made this furious effort against the person of his adversary, Sir William Stanley de∣clared for Richmond, and attacking the royalists in flank, drove their right wing upon the centre, which was so disordered by the shock, that it began to fly with the utmost precipitation; while the earl of Northumberland, who commanded a separate body, stood motionless, and refused to act against the enemy. The king, seeing all his endeavours ineffectual to rally his troops, which were by this time in the utmost confusion, and either scorning to out∣live the disgrace of an overthrow, or dreading the thought of falling alive into the hands of his enemy, rushed into the midst of the battle, where he fought with the most desperate courage, until he was overpowered by numbers, and fell dead in the midst of those whom he had slain. Though the battle lasted about two hours, including the time spent in the pursuit, there was not above one thousand of the royalists killed on the occasion, because the greater part <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed betimes without fighting; and the earl did not lose above an hundred men, of whom Sir William Brandon was the most considerable.

<P>Such was the end of Richard III. the most cruel, unrelenting tyrant that ever sat on the throne of England. He seems to have been an utter stranger to the softer emotions of the human heart, and entirely destitute of every social sentiment. His ruling passion was ambition, for the gratifica∣tion of which he trampled upon every law, both human and divine: but this thirst of dominion was unattended with the least mark of generosity, or any desire of rendering himself agreeable to his fellow creatures: it was the ambition of a savage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He was often characterised by the name of the Boar. And he and his three favourites Catesby, Radcliffe, and Lovel, were included in a satirical cou∣plet, which was frequently repeated in his life time.</P>
<Q><L>The cat, the rat, and Lovel the dog,</L>

<P>Richard left one natural son, a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, whom he had appointed governor of Calais, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and all the Marches of Picardy belonging to the crown of England.</P></NOTE>, not of a prince; for he was a solitary being, altogether detached from the rest of mankind, and incapable of that satisfaction which results from private friendship and disinterested society. We must acknowledge, however, that, after his accession to the throne, his administration in general was con∣ducted by the rules of justice; that he enacted salutary laws, and established wise regulations; and that, if his reign had been protracted, he might have proved an excellent king to the English nation. He possessed an uncommon solidity of judgment, a natural fund of eloquence, the most acute penetration, and such courage as no danger could dismay. He was dark, silent, and re∣served, and so much master of dissimulation, that it was almost impossible to dive into his real sentiments, when he wanted to conceal his designs. His sta∣ture was small, his aspect cloudy, severe, and forbidding; one of his arms was withered, and one shoulder higher than the other, from which circumstances of deformity he acquired the epithet of Crook-Back. Richard III. was the last of the Anjevin race surnamed Plantagenet, which had possessed the crown of England for the space of three hundred and thirty years: but he was not the last male of that family in England; for the earl of Warwick, son to his bro∣ther Clarence, was still alive, and the only remaining branch of all the nume∣rous posterity of the third Edward, which had been almost totally extinguished in the civil war; a war which had raged for thirty years, and was terminated by the battle of Bosworth, after having cost the lives of above one hundred thou∣sand Englishmen, including a great number of princes of the houses of York and Lancaster.</P>

He was accordingly summoned to a synod at Lambeth, where he explained away, in an aukward manner, three of his capital positions, which gave the greatest offence to the clergy: namely, that dominion was sounded on grace; that the temporal power might seize upon the patrimony of the church; and that no ecclesia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tics ought to be vested with a coercive power.

<P>The archbishops, suffragans, and clergy, protested in general terms against this bill; and this protest brought an impeachment by the commons o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the archbishop of Canterbury, for obeying the pope in publishing such cen∣sures, as tended to the open dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erison of the crown, the subversion of the royal prerogative of the king's laws and his whole realm; and for aiding and abet∣ting his holiness in a scheme for translating English prelates to foreign <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees, to the prejudice of the king, the impoverishment of the nation, and contrary to

The archbishop in his defence acquitted himself intirely of the charge, protesting that he would adhere loyally to the king; and endeavour, as in duty bound, to support his majesty in these and all other in∣stances, in which the rights of the crown might be concerned. His answers were extremely agreeable to the commons; the parliament enacted a new sta∣tute of Premunire, more comprehensive than the former, as it affected not only the procurers, abettors, maintainers, and counsellors, but even the favourers of the papal usurpation; so that all application to a foreign jurisdiction, either in the court of Rome or elsewhere, in prejudice of the king's crown and regality, falls within the penalty of this statute. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Coke In<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tit.</NOTE></P>

That faith, hope, and charity, fied from the church of England as soon as she began to mismanage her temporalities: That the English priesthood was not derived from Christ, but from the pope: That the celibacy of the clergy was a source of scandalous impurities: That Christendom had been infected with idolatry by the notion of transubstantiation: That all exorcisms and benedictions, together with the trompery of consecrating churches, altars, and vestments, savoured more of witchcraft and sorcery, than of religion: That the conjunction of civil and spiritual power in the same person, was subversive of all order and good government: That in prayers for the dead, one person was preferred to an∣other: That pilgrimage, prayers, and offerings to images and croffes, were absurd and idolatrous: That auricular confession furnished the priests with opportunities to debauch their penitents: That, to deprive any person of his life, either in war, or a court of justice, was a practice contrary to the doctrine of the New Testament: and, That female vows to lead a single life, promoted infamous correspondence, abortion, and murder: That seeing St. Paul has com∣manded us to be contented with food and raiment, mankind ought to moderate their desires and that goldsmiths, sword cutlers, and many other kinds of ar∣tificers, ought to be suppressed, as the instruments of luxury and homicide. This strange address, which concluded with a stanza of monkish Latin verse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1395,</NOTE> alarmed the clergy to such a degree, that the archbishop of York, and the bi∣shop of London, sent letters to Richard, complaining bitterly of the insolence of the Lollards. The king returned to England, boiling with indignation against this troublesome sect of heretics; and oath of submission by way of test, against Lollardism, was imposed by the secular power, and Richard ordered the chancellor of Oxford to expel all those students or graduates, who were sus∣pected of holding such opinions. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Courtney, archbishop of Canterbury, dying about this period, was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1396.</NOTE> succeeded by Arundel archbishop of York, who called a convocation at Lon∣don, which condemned eighteen articles extracted from Wickliff's Triologus, brought in by the canonists and civilians of Oxford, who at the same time re∣presented, that their exemption by a papal bull, from all archiepiscopal visita∣tion, left them exposed to the tyranny of the chancellor; and therefore, they earnestly besought the metropolitan to resume the power which he antiently possessed. The archbishop relished the proposal, and resolved to visit the uni∣versity, but receiving intimation that he would certainly be opposed by the chancellor and proctors, he applied to the king, who issued a writ directed to

the chancellor and students, requiring them to admit the visitation of the arch∣bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or their ordinary.

<P>This prelate being afterwards exiled for high treason, repaired to Rome, where he was hospitably received by Boniface IX. who created him arch∣bishop of St. Andrew's in Scotland, and intended to bestow upon him several livings in England. Richard being apprized of his design, wrote such a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> letter to the pope, that his ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iness thought proper to abandon Arun∣del; and at the king's recommendation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> filled the see of Canterbury with Roger Walden treasurer of England. He imagined that by this compliance he was intitled to take some freedoms with Richard; and tried his interest accordingly. He translated the bishop of Lincoln to the see of Chester, and conserred the bishopric of Lincoln on the famous Henry Beanfort, afterwards cardinal of England. This step gave great umbrage to the king, who assembled the clergy; and demanded whether or not, the pope had authority to create and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bishops in England. They did not choose to make a direct answer to this question; but advised Richard to write a remonstrance to the pope, desir∣ing him to forbear exerting such authority for the future. Petter de Bofco was afterwards sent over to England as the pope's nuncio, to sollicit the affair of provisions in favour of his holiness; but he found the king inflexible, tho' he was po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itely received, and gratified with some valuable presents.</P>

<P>The schism in the church still continuing between Boniface IX. and Benedict XIII. the French king defired the assistance of Richard in restoring that union which was so necessary for the interest of Christianity; and the king of England assembled the most learned divines of the realm at Oxford, to de∣liberate on measures for obtaining this desirable end. The result of their consul∣tation was, that a general council would be the most speedy and effectual method for re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ting Christendom in their religious tenets; and they promised to pro∣duce before such an assembly, two short propositions that would soon put an end to the schism.

<P>On the death of Boniface, Innocent VII. succeeded to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pal chair; and next year, archbishop Arundel made a visitation of the university o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cam∣bridge in right of his see, and reformed a number of abuses. In the parliament called at Westminster, two new statutes were enacted against the encroachments of Rome, ordaining, that no person under colour of bulls of exempti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n pur∣chased from the pope, should trouble or disturb any prebe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>daries, keepers of hospitals, or vica<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, in the enjoyment of the tithes d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to them in their several benefices; and, that no licence, granted upon pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on to any benefice not yet vacant, should be valid or available. In the course of this year, one Thorp an ecclesiastic, was committed to prison by the archbishop of Canterbury, for certain articles of faith, which were deemed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eretical. He refused <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> swear by the Bible, because it was no mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e than a creatu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and therefore not intitled to adoration. He believed himself inspired by the same spirit which directed the apostles; and published a performance called Thorp's T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stament, in which he inveighed against the hierarchy, affirming, that bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ops and prie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s ought to earn their subsistence by the work of their hands, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd when past their labour, subsist upon charity.

Two hundred conclusions were condemned by the university, and several books com∣mitted to the flames. These severities, however, could not hinder Lollardism from gaining ground in the university, which the archbishop visited with great pomp, accompanied by his nephew the earl of Arundel: he was met at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome distance from the city by the members of the colleges, headed by Richard Courtney the chancellor, who told the metropolitan, that they should be proud to entertain his grace, who, he hoped, had no other design than to see the uni∣versity, as they enjoyed an immunity by a papal b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll from all archiepiscopal vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itation.

conclusions were censured; and all those suspected of favouring such opinions were imprisoned or put into the hands of the archbishop, who applied to the pope for a bull to confirm the censures which he approved, and for another, that would impower him to dig up the bones of Wickliff. The first was readily granted; but the other postponed. In the parliament which met on the third<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>When Henry V. succeeded to the throne, the Lollards expected more indulgence, as this prince seemed to be a latitudinarian in his religious prin∣ciples, and was particularly connected by the ties of friendship with Sir John Oldcastle, who was their great patron. They were miserably disappointed in this hope; for, Henry V. was not only bigotted to the religion in which he had been educated, but resolved to live upon good terms with the clergy, whose a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>istance he foresaw would be necessary towards the execution of the great scheme he had projected against France. Moved by these considerations, he left them in the full enjoyment of their jurisdiction; and one of the first per∣sons against whom they exerted their authority, was Sir John Oldcastle, who espoused the opinions of Wickliff, which we have already explained. He was summoned to the ecclesiastical court by repeated citations, to which he paid no regard: then he was apprehended, and brought before the archbishop, who declared himself ready to absolve him, if he would recant his errors, and move for absolution. In answer to this insinuation, Sir John pulled a paper from his bosom, and delivered it to the prelate, who having perused the contents, said his principles were good in the main; but there was a necessity for his explain∣ing himself further on transubstantiation, and auricular confession. The knight<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1413.</NOTE> refusing to make any other declaration on these points, but what was contained in the written paper, was committed to the Tower, and next day received some queries from the archbishop, touching his opinion of the bread and wine in the sacrament of the altar, auricular confession, the power of the pope, pil∣grimage, and the worship of relics and images; he was desired to consider these articles, and prepare his answers by the twenty-seventh day of September, when the convocation would sit at Black-Friars. Being brought into this assembly by Sir Robert Morley lieutenant of the Tower, he behaved with all the indiscretion of an hot-headed enthusiast. When the archbishop admonished him to crave the benediction of the court, he answered, Maledicam benedictionibus vestris, Curse on your benedictions. Even after this indecent reply, the archbishop told him, that if he would desire absolution in the common form, he should have it without hesitation. To this intimation he answered, that he would
<PB N="460" REF="4700"/>
demand no absolution where he had given no offence. So saying, he fell upon his knees, and in an enthusiastic rhapsody, con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essed all his sins to God, in the hearing of the whole assembly. Being questioned concerning the eucharist, he professed his belief, that, after consecration, Christ's very body was present in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm of bread, the same individual body that was born of the Virgin Mary. Then he was asked, whether or not it was the material bread after consecration; and turning to the archbishop, "I believe said he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is Christ's body in form of bread. Sir, believe you not this?" "Yes, marry, do I!" replied the archbishop. The doctors then interposing, desired to know if he thought any part of the bread remained after consecration; and, he replied, it is both Christ's body and bread. This was the rock upon which he sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it; for, notwithstand∣i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g his explanation, supported by texts of scripture, they declared the opinion h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retical; and, when he challenged them to prove it heresy, they appealed to the determination of holy-church. Sir John being warmed in his own defence, treated the doctors with contempt; and would not even allow the church to be holy, since she had been infected with the poison of wordly possessions. Doctor Walden, a noted theologist of those times, undertook to confute Old∣castle by argument, and the dispute was inflamed to the most bitter altercation; but very little to the purpose was said on either side: Sir John compared them to Annas and Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phas, who sate in judgment upon Christ, and afterwards on his apostles. <Q>“The bishops of Rome (said he) were formerly pious martyrs; but, since they were infected with the poison of worldly possession, they have deposed, poisoned, cursed and assassinated one another: they have filled the whole earth with cruelty and mischief. Christ was meek and merciful: the pope is proud and tyrranous. Christ was poor and compassionate: the pope is rich, arrogant, and a barbarous manslayer. Rome is the very nest of An∣tichrist,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> from whence come all his disciples: prelates, priests, and monks, are the body, and their shaven friars the tail, which covereth his most filthy part.”</Q> Such obloquy could not fail to exasperate the assembly, which being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>animous in finding him guilty, the archbishop pronounced the sentence of condemnation; and, tho' he made his escape from the Tower, he was after∣wards apprehended, and suffered death both as a traitor and heretic, by being hanged and burned at Tyburn.</P>

<P>Upon the death of Alexander V. Balthasar Cossa was chosen his suc∣cessor, under the name of John XXIII. and convoked a general council at Con∣stance, with the consent of the emperor Sigismund; whose aim was not only to abolish the schism which still continued in the church, but also to root out the heresy of Wickliff, which had by this time made great progress in Bohe∣mia, by the teaching and preaching of John Huss, and Jerome of Prague.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> When the council met on the sixteenth day of November, the officers and ser∣vants of the assembly were equally elected out of the five nations of which it was composed, namely, English, Italians, French, Spaniards, and Germans. They agreed to range the fathers of the council under these five nations; and that the plurality of voices should determine all matters proposed. On the twenty-eig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th day of November, John Huss arrived at Constance; and, tho' h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleaded the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-conduct of the emperor, was arrested by order of the pope, who told him, he had never granted a safe-conduct, and was not bound by that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the emperor. On the twenty-third day of December, the emperor appeared
<PB N="461" REF="4710"/>
in council, which proceeded to business; and after much debate, it was found absolutely necessary towards the re-establishment of peace and union in the church, that not only the antipopes, Gregory and Benedict, should be divested of all authority, but even John XXIII. should abdicate his papal dignity. This last, conscious of many enormities in his own conduct, for which he dreaded prosecution, seemingly agreed to the proposal. The emperor was so pleased with his compliance, that he took off his crown, and kissed the pope's feet; and all the members of the council promised to support him against his two rivals, should they refuse to follow his example. John's consent was the effect of dissimulation. On pretence of going to Nice, that he and Benedict might make their renunciation together, he wanted to escape from Constance, that he might put an end to the council. Sigismund suspecting his design, or∣dered the avenues of the city to be guarded; and sent the patriarch of Antioch to John, requiring him to appoint proctors for making the renunciation in his name. The pope declining this proposal, he was presented with the following resolutions of the assembly: That the council had been justly called, and fairly assembled: That even, tho' deserted by the pope, or any other prelates, it should continue in being and authority, until the schism should be extirpated, and a universal reformation in faith and morals take place, both in the head and members of the church: That the council should not be removed to any other place, nor any prelates or others, depart without sufficient reason: That the pope himself should not quit the assembly, but appoint a proctor, to renounce in his name all title to the papal authority. To these articles John replied, that it would be more convenient for himself and the council to remove to Nice, where the king of Arragon and Benedict might confer with the empe∣ror; and that the appointment of a proctor was unnecessary, as he intended to make the renunciation in his own person. This answer plainly demonstrated the intention of the pope, who, notwithstanding the emperor's precautions, made his escape by the assistance of the duke of Austria, and the elector of Mentz, to Schaffhousen, from whence he sent four cardinals to dissolve the council. This conduct produced the famous decree, importing, that this council represent∣ing the catholic church militant, had received immediately from Jesus Christ, a power, which persons of all conditions, even popes themselves, were obliged to obey in every thing concerning the faith, the extirpation of the schism, and re∣formation of the church. John protested against their proceedings; and they sent ambassadors, inviting him to return: but, he insisted upon such high terms, that they altered their strain, and summoned him to appear in nine days, on pain of being proceeded against as a sugitive and delinquent. The emperor perceiving, that he depended intirely upon the protection of the duke of Austria, invaded that dutchy with a numerous army, to the great terror of the duke, who humbled himself before Sigismund, and purchased his peace, by making the pope prisoner at Fribourg. In the mean time, the council condemned the doctrines of Wickliff, pronounced him and his memory accursed, and decreed, that his bones should be dug up and scattered about with infamy. Then they chose commissioners to manage the process against the pope, who was accused of having by simony obtained the dignity of cardinal: of having sold ecclesiasti∣cal preferments: of having attempted to poison his predecessor; sold in∣dulgences and relics, alienated the goods and possessions of churches and mo∣nasteries,

Being convicted on these articles, the council suspended him from the exercise of all papal power, spiritual and tempo∣ral; and a deputation of cardinals was sent to inform him of the sentence. He ex∣pressed the utmost resignation to the decrees of the assembly, and said, he hoped they would have some regard to the condition of life in which he had hitherto appeared; at the same time, he wrote a very humble letter to Sigismund, crav∣ing his favour and protection: but, notwithstanding all his sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ission and in∣treaties, the council proceeded to the sentence of deposition; and decreed, that neither of the three competitors should be mentioned in the ensuing election.</P>

<P>The papacy being thus declared vacant, they began the trial of John Huss the famous Bohemian reformer, who was convicted of Heresy, and committed to the flames, in direct violation of the safe-conduct which had been granted to him by Sigismund; a breach of faith that will reflect eternal dis∣grace on the memory of that emperor. His friend and companion Jerome de Prague, met with the same fate; and both behaved with the courage, simplicity, and christian charity of the primitive martyrs. They were accused of having maintained impious<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> horrible, and damnable opinions. They were con∣demned as seditious, ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinate, incorrigible disciples and defenders of Wick∣liff, hardened, crafty, malicious, and convicted heretics. Notwithstanding this heavy charge, John Huss adopted no part of Wickliff's doctrine, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat concerned the hierarchy of the church, and the manners of the clergy. He believed transubstantiation and the expediency of image-worship: but, he af∣firmed the hierarchy of the church was not founded in scripture: that the ex∣cessive authority of popes, cardinals, and bishops, was mere usurpation: that the clergy in general were corrupted in their manners; and the benefactions to the church shamefully misapplied. The council used all their art to draw him into a doubt or denial of transubstantiation; and as he would not con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess any such p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inciple, he was convicted of it on the deposition of evidence. This ar∣ticle was inserted in his sentence merely as a pretext; but every unprejudiced person will perceive and own, that he and his companion were sacrificed to the temporal interest of the clergy. It was not the faith, but the authority of the church which they thought in danger: the same principle manifested itself in thus condemning the administration of the communion in both species. This they did not condemn as a thing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil in itself; on the contrary, they owned it had been practised in the antient church. But, they pronounced an anathema against those who a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erted, that the church had no right to abolish that prac∣tice. With respect to some other strange doctrines which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell under their cog∣nizance, as they did not affect the power of the clergy, the council pro∣ceeded upon them with surprizing indifference. John <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>etit a lawyer, in the dominions of the duke of Burgundy, maintained, that each individual had a right to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lay a tyrant even by treachery: and this proposition being presented to the council, that assembly, after much soll<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>citation, declared it erroneous, without punishing, or even naming the author. The sect of Flagillators asserted many capital errors, which being discussed by the council, it was resolved to find o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t some gentle means for bringing them back into the pale of the church.

The same coldness they manifested in the work of reformation, which was so ne∣cessary. A list of abuses indeed was made out, and they agreed upon the mo∣del of reformation: but, by the artifice and intrigues of the cardinals and others, the execution of this plan was postponed, and afterwards wholly laid aside. The council now resolved to choose a new pope, and, for this purpose, six prelates were chosen out of each of the five nations, and joined as assessors to the cardinals in whom the power of electing was formerly vested: it was de∣creed that no person should be deemed duly elected without having in his fa∣vour two thirds of the cardinals and assessors; and that the stadhouse of the city should be prepared as a conclave to be guarded by the emperor and magistrates.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baronius.

<P>In the mean time the persecution raged among the Lollards in Eng∣land, where John Cleyden, a citizen of London, and one Richard Turming, a baker, were burned in Smithfield. The archbishop, in convocation, enacted a constitution directed to his suffragans, enjoining them to make strict search and inquiry twice a year after the persons suspected of heresy, that they might be proceeded against according to law, and either committed to prison or to the flames, as the nature of their crimes might require. A synod, being con∣vened by the archbishop of Canterbury at London, granted two tenths as a supply for the war in France; and the duke of Bedford notified to the assembly the election of pope Martin V. whose elevation was celebrated with rejoicings, anthems, and other acts of devotion. The assembly then enacted a decree for regulating the graduations at the two universities, which decree met with great opposition at Oxford and Cambridge; though it was at last received by the in∣terposition of king Henry V. who was himself a patron of learning. Pope Mar∣tin began to encroach upon the liberties of the English church with the same arbitrary power which had been exercised by his predecessors: he disposed of bishoprics by way of provision, and vacated the elections of the chapters. Henry, in order to put a stop to this usurpation, as also to reform a number of abuses which had crept in among the clergy, sent John Ketterick, bishop of Co∣ventry and Litchfield, to demand of the pope an express Concordat, to which his holiness agreed. In a convocation, held at this period in London, one Richard Walker, a priest, of Worcester, was tried and convicted of witchcraft, which he solemnly renounced, and did publick penance. Many people were likewise obliged to abjure Lollardism; and the assembly granted a large subsidy to the king, who suppressed the French monasteries in England, and granted their lands to other colleges of the learned. After this king's marriage, a convo∣cation held at London presented the king with a tenth, on condition that his purveyors should not encroach upon the goods of churchmen; and that no clergyman should be imprisoned but for theft and murder. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Goodwin.</NOTE></P>

<P>Towards the latter end of the reign of the fifth Henry, the Bene∣dictine monks were become so luxurious and dissolute, that the king insisted upon a reformation; and a provincial Capitulary for that purpose wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> held in the Charter-house at Westminster; where it was ordai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, That the ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors should employ their attention in the care of souls: That the extravagance of their equi∣page should be retrenched, so as that none should be attended by above twenty horse, under a severe temporal penalty: That they should never make a gift of the effects of the convent above the value of forty shillings: That they should be uniform in the colour and fashion of their habits: That their necessities should be supplied in kind and not in money: That they should not have di∣stinct private cells for the entertainment of female guests; and, That they should be restricted from going into cities and towns to assist at compotations and merry-makings. By writs dated July 10, 1422, the king ordered the two archbishops to assemble their clergy in convocation, that they might grant a subsidy for the support of the French war; but the lower clergy alledged they were not properly impowered by their constituents to grant money; so that the assembly was dissolved without having come to any resolution in the king's fa∣vour. During this session, Robert Hake and Thomas Drayton, two priests, were accused of heresy, because they refused to kneel to a crucifix, were in pos∣session of books written against the doctrine of transubstantiation, and inveighed against auricular confession as an invention of the devil.

<P>Archbishop Chichely was certainly a great enemy to Lollardism; but, at the same time it must be owned, he was a bold defender of the church of England against papal encroachments. In his first convocation he moved for annulling papal exemptions; he opposed the great power with which the pope
<PB N="465" REF="4750"/>
had invested the cardinal bishop of England. He presented to the king a full e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ract of the nature, extent, and mischievous consequences of the legatine of∣fice. As the cardinal was impowered to hold the bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic of Winchester in comm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nda<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he rem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rated against the practice, as wholly unprecedented<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham.</NOTE> in England; he represented that the English church needed no such supple∣mental buttre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es as the power of legates a latere: that this office had been always dangerous to the crown of England, even when limited to one year; and that the danger mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be much greater from the cardinal's commission, which was for life. Henry V. protected the archbishop against the vengeance of the pope, who was incensed against that prelate for his opposition to the encroach∣ments of Rome, and much more so for his acquiescence in the statute of pre∣muni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. The king's eyes were no sooner closed, than he poured forth his indig∣nation in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Chichely, wherein he accused him of having neglected his p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>toral care, and minding nothing but the means of amassing wealth. He said the archbishop suffered his flock to brouze on poisonous herbs; and that when wolves came to devour them, he stood like a dumb dog, without so much as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cking. Then he inveighed against the statute of premunire, as an act that re∣pealed the laws of God and the church, and destroyed the antient usages of the kingdom. He complained that Jews, Turks, and infidels of all sorts, were al∣lowed to land in Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d; whereas any person commissioned by the holy see, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as a common enemy: and he concluded with an order to the arch∣bishop to repair to the council, and use all his interest there and in the parlia∣ment for the repeal of this statute; otherwise he should incur the penalty of excommunication. Chichely sent an apology for his conduct to Rome; not∣withstanding which he was again severely reprimanded, and his legatine power suspended. From this sente<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce he appealed to a future council; or, if that should not fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to the tribunal of God. Martin wrote monitory letters to all the clergy in England, expatiating upon the illegality of the acts of provisors and pre∣munire. He sent a letter to the two archbishops, annulling all those statutes, and forbidding the metropolitans to act upon the authority of such laws on pain of excommunication; and at the same time wrote a monitory letter, addressed to the people of England, which he charged the archbishop to publish and affix in all public places. The archbishop of York, and the bishops of London, Durham, and Lincoln, wrote to his holiness in favour of Chichely. Their ex∣ample was followed by the university of Oxford, which gave testimony greatly to the honour of the archbishop's character, and termed him the golden candle∣stick of the church of England. These recommendations were accompanied with a submissive letter of the prelates own writing: but, inspite of all this inter∣position, Martin remained implacable, and summoned Chichely to Rome, as an enemy to the pope in England. His holiness was the more exasperated, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uncio, who delivered his letters and bulls, had been imprisoned by the govern∣ment. This outrage produced letters from the pope to the king, the duke of Bedford, and the parliament, complaining of such barbarous treatment, and exhorting them to concur in repealing the statutes. When the parliament met the archbishop of Canterbury, attended by him of York, and the bishops of London, St. David's, Ely, Norwich, together with the abbots of Westminster and Reading, repaired to the house of commons; and, in an elaborate speech, advised them to repeal the statutes which had given such offence: but, the
<PB N="466" REF="4760"/>
members supposing this harangue was the effect of compulsion, payed no re∣gard to the remonstrance; but presented an address to the king, desiring his majesty would write to the pope for the purgation of the archbishop. When the crusade against the Bohemians was preached up, and the cardinal of Win∣chester declared general of that enterprize, the pope ordered that prelate to col∣lect a te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th from the English clergy for the expence of the expedition: but all the convocation would grant was eight-pence in the mark, on condition it should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound consistent with the king's prerogative and the laws of the king∣dom. The nuncio, thinking this supply insufficient, ventured to collect money without being properly authorized, and was imprisoned for his presumption.</P>

<P>A council being summoned to meet at Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il, the archbishop of Canterbury held a convocation at London, when delegates were chosen to re∣present the English church in that assembly, and two-pence in the pound vo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d for their expence. Thomas, bishop of Worcester; William, prior of Norwich; Thomas Brown, dean of Salisbury; Peter Patrick, chancellor of Lincoln; Ro∣bert Barton, precentor of Lincoln; John Salisbury, doctor of divinity; and John Simon Desborough, batchelor in common law, were chosen for this pur∣pose, and received instructions to act against all papal dispensations and other abuses which had crept into the church of Rome; especially that of providing livings for unqualified persons. Pope Martia would have avoided convening this council, if it had been in his power, but finding himself strongly pressed by the emperor and other powers in Christendom, he ordered cardinal Juli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Since the council of Constance, the Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of Bohemia had been treated with such rigour, as served only to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them in the belief of their tenets, which they resolved to maintain in spite of the decrees of the council. The principal article on which they insisted, was the communion in both species; and their resolution, in this particular, was oppo∣sed by the pope and the catholics in such a manner, as filled Bohemia with civil war and confusion. On the death of their king Winces<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aus, his brother Sigismund, the emperor, claimed the succession; but was rejected by the H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sites, as a persecutor of their sect, and a notorious faith-breaker. Martin V. espousing the cause of Sigismund, and publishing crusades against the Hussites, they found themselves obliged to stand in their own defence, and chose for their general one Zisca, who defeated the emperor in several engagements. This war continued till the meeting of the council at Basil; which, considering the bad success of Sigismund, resolved to make peace with the Hussites. With this view the fathers invited them to send deputies to the council, who, being sent accordingly, presented four articles; to which, should the council agree, they offered to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ite themselves with the church. They demanded, that the communion should be administered in both species to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aity in Bohemia: that sinners should be corrected according to the law of God, by those to whom such correction properly belonged: that the word of God should be preached by well qualified pastors: and, that the clergy should have no ju∣risdiction over temporalities. The fathers of the council exhausted all their art and eloquence in persuading the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ohemians to submit to the church at discretion; b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding them inflexible, resolved to grant their demands<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on condition that they should be previously explained, in order to avoid new dis∣putes. They accordingly explained them in their own way, and a Concordat
<PB N="467" REF="4770"/>
was settled, to the satisfaction of all parties. This affair being accommodated, Sigismund was acknowledged king of Bohemia, after having approved of the Concordat, and subscribed some other conditions: but, he had no sooner mounted the t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, than he broke his promise; and the pope refused to sign the Concordat.

Several d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rees were made to exalt the authority of the council above that of the pope; and these, as fast as they were enacted, did his holiness cancel and annul; affirming that the member<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could not act without the direction of the head. A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the emperor, the king of France, and almost all the other princes of Europe, declared for the council, Euge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius was fain to conform, and allow it to proceed: but, when he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ont other legates to preside in his name, they refused to receive them in that quali<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y; and this refusal was a new cause of dissension. The pope threatened again to dissolve the council, and this last menaced his holiness with a sentence of suspension; at length, however, Eugenius, finding himself u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equal to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contest, dropped all opposition, and confirmed the council.

The fathers at Basil, exasperated at this step, filled all Europe with remonstrances touching the pope's perfidy: they protested against the assembly at Ferrara, sum∣moned all the prelates to repair to Basil in thirty days, and denounced excom∣munication against all those who should obstruct their coming. The council was support<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the Germans, Spaniards, and the majority of the Italians. Charles VII. of France convoked an assembly of his prelates, in which it was resolved that France should own the authority of the council at Basil; but, at the same time, yield obedience to pope Eugenius: the English, however, fa∣voured Eugenius, because the council had refused to ratify the treaty of Troyes, by which Charles VII. was excluded from the succession; and king Henry promi∣sed to send delegates to the council of Ferrara.

<P>During these efforts of the clergy in England, the council of Basil continued to proceed against pope Eugenius, whom they at length deposed, and chose in his room Amadeus, duke of Savoy, who had resigned the admi∣nistration of his dominions, and retired to a life of solitude at Ripaile. This new pontiff assumed the name of Felix V. and now a double schism was formed in the church between two general councils and two popes, who condemned<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ch. 1441.</NOTE> and excommunicated one another, and all their adherents mutually. In order to concert measures for terminating this scandalous contention, an assembly was held in Germany by the princes and prelates of the empire; who could find no other expedient for that purpose than the convocation of a new council, till the meeting of which they should remain neuter. This proposal was con∣firmed by the diet of Frankfort, and the council of Basil assented to it, though<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1442.</NOTE> with reluctance. Mean while pope Felix, being discontented at the proceed∣ings of the fathers at Basil, who he thought acted with too high a hand, reti∣red to Lausanne, on pretence that the air of this place was more healthy than that of Basil; and Eugenius t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anslated his council from Florence to Rome, where the session was held in the church of St. John of Lateran.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>At length, the German princes, assembling at Frankfort, unani∣mously resolved that if Eugenius should refuse to give them satisfaction with respect to certain grievances of which they complained, they would acknow∣ledge the election and authority of Felix. Eugenius scrupled at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst to com∣ply with their demands; but the emperor, giving him to understand that he would infallibly lose all Germany by his non-compliance, he condescended to grant all that the Germans desired; and a Concordat was ratified accordingly.
<PB N="469" REF="4790"/>
This was a terrible stroke to the council of Basil, which had been already dis∣owned by Italy, Arragon, and several other countries, besides France and Eng∣land: though it conceived fresh hopes from the death of its antagonist Euge∣nius, who was succeeded by Nicholas V. Nevertheless, it gained very little advantage from this alteration: on the contrary, its authority diminished every day; and Felix retained but a very small number of p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtisans. The king of France assembling an ecclesiastical council at Lyons, to deliberate upon mea∣sures for terminating the schism, Felix sent thither his legates, and consented to resign the pontificate upon certain conditions. This offer was the subject of a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trithemius Aventinus Mutius.</NOTE> negotiation with Nicholas, who having granted almost all the demands of his competitor, Felix resigned his dignity with the approbation of his council, which had by this time removed to Lausanne, where, in its last decree, it ap∣proved the cession of Felix, created him cardinal and legate a latere in Savoy and the Tarentaise; and allowed him to wear for life the pontifical habit. Ni∣cholas confirmed this decree according to agreement; and thus ended the dis∣pute which had produced a complication of three schisms; first between Eu∣genius and the council of Basil, then between the two general councils, and lastly between the two popes.</P>

<P>The zeal of the English clergy, in supporting the pope against the council, encouraged Nicholas to renew the papal encroachments in England. He sent a pompous epistle to the king, together with a consecrated rose; and at the same time demanded a t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nth on the clergy. He was, however, disap∣pointed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1452.</NOTE> in his hope. His request was denied; and the archbishop of Canter∣bury prohibited from executing the pope's bull, or suffering any money to be collected. In a subsequent convocation held at London, the pope's agent so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣licited a supply for his master. He expatiated upon the narrow escape of his holiness from the wicked attempt of Stephen Porchard, inveighed against the degeneracy of the Roman people; and declared, that if the English would grant a proper supply, the pope would immediately quit Rome and Italy, and reside in some place near England. All that the English clergy would grant, in consequence of this remonstrance, was a form of prayer for the personal safety of his holiness. It was about this period, that Strafford archbishop of Canter∣bury died, and had for his successor John Kemp cardinal archbishop of York, who had been dean of the arches, vicar-general to archbishop Chicheley, and governor of Normandy: then he was created bishop of Rochester, from whence he was translated to Chichester, and afterwards to London and York. This prelate dying within the year after his elevation, the vacant see was filled by Thomas Bourchier brother to the earl of Essex, and cardinal bishop of Ely, who made a visitation into Kent, and composed a set of articles of reformation for his province.</P>

<P>But the most remarkable churchman that lived at this period, was Peacock bishop of Chichester, a person of great learning and reputation, who publicly asserted, that the Latin fathers St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, and St. Gregory, ought to have no greater authority than the strength of their reasoning, and the merit of their doctrine, acquired; that matters of faith could be judged by reason alone, to which he likewise referred all controversy; that the apostles were not the authors of the creed which they were supposed to have framed; that the meaning of the Holy Scriptures was to be learned from

natural reason only; that Christ never descended into hell; and that christians were not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bliged to observe the canons, any further than they should appear agreeable to reason and common sense. He inveighed agai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st the o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tentation and mag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ificen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of churchmen; he repro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched them for their neglect of pa∣roc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al duties: he said they themselves might sit as originals of the defo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mities they las<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed; and that they recommended those qualifications of whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h they fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd themselves destitute.

<P>Edward IV. found the friendship of the clergy so necessary, that he granted a charter, exempting them from the jurisdiction of the civil power in criminal causes, remitting all such to the judgment of their ordinaries.

Geoffrey Chaucer, a man of a good family, was caressed for his talent in po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try by Edward III. who allowed him a pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cher of wine every day from his cellar.

helped to improve and purify the English language. His friend John Gower<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bayle.</NOTE> was likewise a celebrated poet and historian; and wrote with reputation in the English, French, and Latin languages. Among the other persons of that age, noted for learning, the principal were, Stephen Packington, a Carmelite fri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, created bishop of St. David's by Henry V. He wrote against the Wickliff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes, translated Aesop'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fables, and composed divers tracts on the divinity of the times. John Purvey, master of arts at Oxford, pupil and defendant of Wick∣liff. William Holmes, a physician, who wrote a work in Latin upon simple medicines. Thomas Rodbourn was a celebrated mathematician and divine, chancellor of the university of Oxford, president of Merton College, archdeacon of Sudbury, and bishop of St. David's. He wrote a chronicle, said to be pre∣served in Bennet's College in Cambridge, together with a volume of miscel∣lanies. Alleyn de Lynn, a Carmelite friar and prior of the convent, who made indexes for fifty different authors, and turned the historical part of the Bible into allegories. John Seguard, a Latin poet, who wrote satires against the priests, under the patronage and protection of Richard Courtney the martial bishop of Norwich. John Walter, skilled in natural philosophy and mathematics. Ro∣bert Roos, prior of the Carmelites at Norwich, a subtile reasoner and learned divine. John Luck of Merton College in Oxford, deep read in divinity. Ri∣chard Caistre, surnamed the Good, a man of equal piety and learning. Ri∣chard Snettisham, chancellor of Oxford, an excellent disputant and expounder of the scriptures. John Beston, prior of a convent of Carmelites at Lynn, counted the greatest orator of the age, was famous for his knowlege in philosophy and divinity, and appointed one of the delegates to the council of Siena, which, though called by Martin V. was never assembled. Leland, a noted gramma∣rian, who taught with uncommon applause in the university of Oxford. John<NOTE PLACE="marg">More<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i.</NOTE> Bate, prior of the Carmelites at York, a great master in the Greek language, and author of several treatises on religion. Richard Ullerstone, fellow of Queen's College in Oxford, doctor in divinity, and canon of York, was a zealous per∣secutor of those who adopted Wickliff's doctrine. He published a book upon the articles of faith of the Roman catholic church; and composed a per∣formance in Latin, upon the reformation of the clergy. Peter Clark, master of arts in the university of Oxford, was a follower of Wickliff, and disputed about the controverted points with Thomas Walden. He was very zealous in the cause of Lollardism; and, being obliged to quit his native country, retired to Bohemia, where he was apprehended by order of the emperor. Thomas W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣den distinguished himself above all his cotemporaries, in refuting the doctrines of Wickliff. Henry IV. sent him to the council at Pisa, where he signalized his zeal and talents against the schism of the two antipopes. He was made pro∣vincial<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goodwin.</NOTE> prior of the Carmelites. Henry V. chose him for his confessor, and sent him to the council of Constance, as the best qualified of any man in England to dispute against the Hussites. He was afterwards employed in mediating a dif∣ference between the king of Poland and the grand master of the Teutonic order. He converted Wiltold duke of Lithuania to the christian religion; and was in the bed-chamber when Henry V. expired. Richard Fleming was at first a fa∣vourer of Wickliff's doctrine; but afterwards became a violent persecutor of the Lollards, and was appointed one of the twelve censors of their tenets. He founded Lincoln College as a seminary for Antiwickliffites<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was appointed

from a family to which he had an unconquerable aversion, he resolved to assume the sovereignty as heir of the house of Lancaster; and in the mean time to take such precautions as would prevent any rivalship. With this view, he sent Sir Robert Willoughby with a detachment of horse, to remove the earl of War∣wick to the Tower, from the castle of Sheriff-Hutton in Yorkshire, in which he had been confined by Richard. As this nobleman, the son of the duke of Clarence, was the only male branch of the house of York, supposed to be then living, Henry ordered him to be strictly guarded in the Tower, and kept from all communication, until the unfortunate prince fell by the hands of the common executioner. The princess Elizabeth had been likewise detained as a prisoner at large by the late king, in the castle of Sheriff-Hutton; and now she received a message from Henry, desiring she would repair to London, and live with her mother, until the celebration of their nuptials, which, however, he intended to postpone, until his own title should be recognized by par∣liament. He himself took the same route, and chose to enter the city on a Sa∣turday, because he had obtained the victory at Bosworth on that day of the week, which he ever after accounted propitious to his fortune. The mayor and companies of London received him at Shoreditch, from when<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he made his public entry, amidst the acclamations of the people, who looked upon him as their deliverer, and the person in whose union with Elizabeth, all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni∣mosity between the two Roses would be extinguished. Never<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heless, the popu∣lace were a little dissatisfied at his passing through the city in a close chariot, so as that he could not be seen like their former kings, who had always entered the city on horseback. He proceeded directly to St. Paul's church, where he offered up the standards he had won; and Te Deum being again celebrated, he repaired to his lodging at the bishop's palace.</P>

<P>In a few days after his arrival at London, he assembled a council of all the nobility and persons of distinction who happened to be at his court, or in the neighbourhood; and solemnly renewed the oath he had formerly taken to wed the princess Elizabeth. He found this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tep absolutely necessary, to de∣stroy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> a report that he was actually engaged to marry Anne da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghter and heir of the duke of Brittany. He had always intended to fulfil his first obligation; but his intention was to defer his marriage until he should have received the crown, lest he should be supposed to strengthen his right by that union with the house of York. In the month of September, the city of London and some other parts of the kingdom were afflicted with a new distemper called the sweat∣ing sickness, a kind of malignant fever which made great havock, and of which the patient commonly died in four and twenty hours, after his being first taken. This malady, however, was of short duration; and even before it disappeared, the method of cure was pretty well ascertained. Among the first acts of Hen∣ry's sovereignty, he bestowed the government of the Tower upon the earl of Ox∣ford, who had been always a zealous partisan for the house of L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>caster. Then he published a proclamation, specifying that he had concluded one year's t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce with the king of France: a circumstance that opera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to his advantage in Eng∣land, which was the better disposed to obey his government, on account of his t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle's being acknowledged by such a prince as Charles, even before it was re∣cogni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by his own parliament.

<P>The ceremony of the coronation was performed on the thirtieth day of October, by cardinal Bourchier archbishop of Canterbury; and that same day Henry instituted a body-guard of fifty archers, called yeomen, under the com∣mand of a captain, to be in continual attendance on his person; which band has been kept up by all his successors. On the seventh day of November, the parliament meeting at Westminster, intailed the crown upon Henry, not by way of recog∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ordinance, but in the manner of settlement; enacting, That the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the crown should rest, remain and abide, in him and the heirs of his body; and this statute was afterwards confirmed by the pope's bull, in which, however, his titles of descent and conquest were recited. The act of settle∣ment and succession being passed, a difficulty arose about the reversal of the sentences of attainder, which had been denounced against Henry's adherents. A good number of these were actually returned to serve in this parliament; and some members observed, that they could not with any justice sit as judges in their own cause. The king referred this point to the decision of the judges, who were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nanimously of opinion, that the members in question should absent themselves from the parliament, until their attainder should be annulled by a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tute. Another debate ensued, touching the king himself, who had been declared traitor and rebel by an authentic act of parliament. This was a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e knotty point than the former; because he could not detach himself from parliament without its being dissolved: not was he at all disposed to sub∣mit to a parliamentary inquiry. On this occasion the judges declared, that the possession of the throne takes away all defects, and clears the possessor from all se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence, crime, or attainder. These affairs being discussed, the parliament pro∣ceeded to p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a bill of attainder against the late king, under the name of Rich∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d duke of Gloucester, as well as against the duke of Norsolk, the earl of Surrey, lord Lovel, lord Ferrers, lord Zouch, Richard Ratcli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, William Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and several other adherents of Richard. Thus, he at once gratified his revenge and his avarice; for, the confiscations produced such large sums, that he could not with any decency ask a subsidy from parliament. When he had in this manner taken vengeance on his enemies, and filled his coffers; he published a general a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nesty in favour of all those who had taken up arms against him, provided they should make their submission within a limited time; and imme∣diately a great number quitted sanctuary, and took the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath of allegiance. Before the parliament broke up, the lord of Chandos, a native of Brittany, was created earl of Bath, Sir Giles D'Aubeny was promoted to the title of a baron, and Sir Robert Willoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by was made lord Brooke: at the same time, the king re∣stored to Edward Strafford the title of duke of Buckingham, which he had lost by the attainder of his father; and re-established him in possession of the fami∣ly-e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> which had been confiscated in the last reign.</P>

In ord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to dis∣charge the obligation of the loan, Henry attempted to borro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> six <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> marks of the city of London; but, it was with great diffi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulty that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on∣sented to lend him two thousand pounds, which he thankfully r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceived, and punctually repayed.

The demonstrations of popul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r satisfaction which appeared on this occasion, were extremely mortifying to the king, who considered them as so many marks of affection to the house of York, for which he had conceived such aversion, that his queen was alway<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> treat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by him with the utmost coldness and indifference.

While he resided in this city, he received intimation, that the lord Lovel, with Humphrey and Thomas Stafford, had privately withdrawn from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sanc∣tuary at Colchester.

On the twentieth day of September, the queen was in the eighth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onth of her pregnancy, delivered of a son, who was baptized by the name of Arthur, in memory of the famous Briti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Arthur, from whom the king affected to derive his origin. The people hoped, that the birth of this pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e would w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rm the king's indifference into a real affection for the mother; b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, when they perceived it had no such effect; that he delayed her corona∣tion; took all opportunities of depressing the friends of the house of York, which was generally beloved throughout the whole kingdom; that his dispo∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion was sordid and illiberal; and, that his temper was sullen and reserved: th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gan to look upon him with detestation, and even to think they had made a bad exchange for the tyrant Richard.

<P>The universal joy expressed by the English people at this report, encouraged Richard Simon, a priest of Oxford, to devise a scheme which was equally e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>avagant and enterprizing. He had a pupil called Lambert Sim∣nel, the illegitimate son of a joiner, a youth of uncommon vivacity and extraordinary personal accompli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ments; and, him he resolved to pass upon the world as Richard duke of York, the second son of the fourth Edward. While he was empl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed in preparing this actor for the stage, it was rumoured, that Edward Plantagenet earl of Warwick had escaped from the Tower; and

Simon immediately changing his plan, determined that his p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pil s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sona<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e this nobleman; a scheme much more e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rava<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t than th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we consider, that the son of Clarence had been, after his f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther's death, honourably maintained in the court of his u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cle Edward, until he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n years of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that therefore, his person was well known to a g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t number of peop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

As they were both partisans of the house of York, in all p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i∣lity, they had by their emissaries privately concerted this scheme with Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, who was likewise supposed to have been encouraged by the quee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who deeply resented Henry's behaviour to her daughter.

<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>When Simnel arrived at Dublin, he forthwith addressed himself to the earl, in quality of earl of Warwick, recounting the manner in which he pre∣tended to have escaped from the Tower; and tho' the deputy-lieuten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt and his brother did not openly espouse his cause at his fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t landing, their omitting to apprehend such a pretender, plainly indicates their co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niva<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce at the imp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ture. They waited to see the effects of the deceit am<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g the common people, who received Simnel with transports of joy, as the son o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their beloved Cla∣rence. Then the earl of Kildare, and his brother the chancellor, having con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erred with their friends and confidents, waited upon Sim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el at his lodgings; from whence he was conducted with great solemnity to the castle, where he was treated as a prince, and behaved with such dignity of deportment, as ove<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>came the suspicion of many people, who at first doubted the truth of his pretensions. The popular stream was so much in his favo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, that in a few days he was pro∣claimed king of England, and lord of Ireland, under the name of Edward VI. and not a sword was drawn, nor one mouth opened in behalf of Henry.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>Such an event could not but be alarming to the king, who now saw himself attacked in his weakest part, namely, his title, and in a country wholly devoted to his adversaries, which he could not pretend to subdue without a very considerable expence: besides, he apprehended, that the fire which had broke out in Ireland would soon communicate to the other kingdom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by means of secret correspondence, the nature and manner of which he did not know. Perplexed by these considerations, he convened his privy council, in order to deliberate upon the measures to be taken in such an emergency; and here, in all probability, he signified his suspicion of his mother-in-law the queen do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ager; for she was immediately confined in the monastery of Bermonds<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y;
<PB N="480" REF="4900"/>
and deprived of her whole estate without any form of process. The whole nation exclaimed against this act of severity, which he in vain endeavoured to palliate, by giving out that this punishment was inflicted upon her for hav∣ing delivered her daughters into the hands of Richard: a pretence which served only to inflame the resentment of the people, who thought it very strange, that the queen should be so severely punished for that which was rather maternal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> weakness than any premeditated crime. Besides, they could not comprehend the meaning of Henry's having so long delayed to take cognizance of this af∣fair: they thought his marrying the daughter was an acknowledgment of the mother's innocence, or at least, a tacit forgiveness of the fault. They consi∣dered that she had been one of the chief instruments of his elevation to the throne, and therefore could not help detesting his ingratitude; and, in this rigorous treatment, they perceived a formed design to seize all opportunities of completing the ruin of the house of York, and its adherents. There was some mystery in this confinement of the queen-mother, which never was ex∣plained to the public. As all historians agree, that she was certainly concerned in the affair of Simnel, the king, in all probability, could have convicted her in a legal manner of the conspiracy; or at least fixed upon her such strong suspicion, as would have given a plausible colour to the steps he took for secur∣ing her person. But, such a process would have introduced an inquiry, which he seemed to avoid. Perhaps, it would have appeared, that the queen-mother had not complied with Richard's desire in sending her daughters to court, un∣til he had taken some extraordinary step to quiet her fears. Perhaps, that sa∣tisfaction consisted in his conniving at the escape of his surviving nephew from the Tower. By means of this conjecture we can account for the queen's con∣fidence in the tyrant, who had brought her kindred to the scaffold, as well as for Henry's behaviour at this juncture, when, perhaps, she played off the phan∣tom Simnel, in order to sound the inclination of the people, and pave the way for exhibiting her own son upon the stage. This supposition likewise explains the case of Perkin Warbeck, and the inflexibility of Henry, who could never be pre∣vailed upon to release his mother-in-law, tho' the whole nation clamoured at her imprisonment, which continued for some years, until death set her at liberty.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>The queen being secured in the monastery of Bermondsey, Henry, in order to undeceive the populace, who began to believe, that the earl of War∣wick was actually in Ireland, ordered that young prince to be conducted pub∣licly through the streets of London, from the Tower to St. Paul's church, whither the people went in vast crouds to behold him; and he was permitted to conve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se with several individuals, who were well acquainted with his person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> and well aff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted to his family. After this procession<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was sent back to the Tower; but, the I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish retorted the imposture upon Henry, affirming, that the youth whom he had produced was a counterfeit; and that Simnel was the true earl of Warwick. The king fearing the contagion would spread into England, published a general amnesty for those who should quit the party of the rebels, with promise of reward to such as should come and discover the particulars of the co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spiracy. At the same time, he ordered the coasts to be guarded, to cut off all c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrespondence between the malecontents of the two kingdoms. Notwithstanding all his precautions, the pretender acquired some powerful
<PB N="481" REF="4910"/>
friends in England; or rather, the priest who tutored Simnel, had been encou∣raged by persons of the first quality, to produce this impostor, whom he would have hardly presumed to exhibit without some promise of consider∣able support. He no sooner made his appearance in Ireland, than John earl of Lincoln, whom his uncle Richard III. had declared presumptive heir of the crown, openly espoused his cause, and embarked for Flanders, in order to con∣cert with his aunt Margaret dutchess dowager of Burgundy, the proper measures for insuring success to this enterprize. That princess being incensed at Henry's behaviour to her niece, and the virulence with which he persecuted all<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the par∣tisans of the house of York, readily<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> engaged in the scheme of Simnel, which in all probability had been projected with her privity and concurrence; and after having deliberated with Lincoln and Lovel, promised to furnish two thousand veteran German troops, commanded by Martin Swart, an officer of reputation, which should accompany them to Ireland, and join the new king's party. They<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1487.</NOTE> accordingly set sail in the beginning of May, and arrived in safety at Dublin, where Simnel was crowned with great solemnity in the cathedral, by the bishops of Armagh, Dublin, Meath, and Derry, in presence of the earl of Kildare, the chancellor, and all the other officers of state belonging to that kingdom. This<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> ceremony being performed with a crown taken from a statue of the Virgin Mary, the new king assembled a kind of parliament, in which the clergy granted a subsidy to the pope, in hope of rendering his holiness propitious to their undertaking. Then a council was held, to regulate the measures to be next pursued; and after some debate they agreed, that the seat of the war should be transferred to England, where they expected to be joined by all the favourers of the house of York, so as to be able to depose the usurper without the least difficulty.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time, Henry was employed in making preparations to defend himself against the impending storm. He was no sooner in∣formed of Lincoln's retreat to Flanders, than he took it for granted that the dutchess of Burgundy was concerned in the conspiracy, and was the more alarmed as he knew the enterprizing disposition of that princess, whose hatred he had incurred. He forthwith levied two armies, the command of which he bestowed upon the duke of Bedford and the earl of Oxford, in order to guard both sides of the island from invasion; and during the winter he made a progress in person to the counties of Suffolk and Norfolk, where he had most reason to expect a descent, on account of their neighbourhood to the Low Coun∣tries. When he arrived at St. Edmundsbury, he received intimation that the marquis of Dorset was on the road to visit him, that he might vindicate him∣self from some malicious imputations, and offer his service to his majesty: but, Henry, instead of accepting his offer, sent the earl of Oxford to meet and conduct him prisoner to the Tower, tho' he was desired to assure the marquis, that, after the extinction of the rebellion, he should have a fair hearing; and, that his present arrest would conduce to his own safety, by hindering him from being misled by evil counsellors. From Edmundsbury the king repaired to Norwich, where he kept his Christmas, thence he proceeded in pilgrimage to visit our Lady's church of Walsingham; and then returned by the way of Cambridge to London. Here he learned, that the earl of Lincoln with his foreign auxiliaries had landed in Ireland: so that being sreed from his appre∣hension of a descent from Flanders, he assembled all his troops in the neighbour∣hood
<PB N="482" REF="4920"/>
of Coventry, which is in the heart of the kingdom; and repairing to that city in person, resolved to wait for more certain information touching the de∣signs of the enemy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>He had not remained long in this situation, when he was informed that Simnel and his friends were landed in Lancashire, and joined by Sir Tho∣mas Broughton, and a small number of English malecontents. They had be∣gun their march towards York, in hope of seeing their numbers daily increase; and they forbore all acts of hostility in the country through which they passed, with a view to interest the people in their favour. They were, however, miserably disappointed in their expectation. The natives, either dreading the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agacity and fortune of Henry, or averse to a king introduced by the Irish and Ger∣mans, f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from taking arms in his favour, exhibited no marks of good will to the enterprize; and the earl of Lincoln <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earing that his army, consisting of eight thou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and men, would rather diminish than increase, resolved to give battle to the king before all his reinforcements should be assembled. For this purpose, he changed his rou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and marched towards Newark, in hope of making himself master of that place before the arrival of the enemy. Henry had advanced to No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ingham, at the head of six thousand men; and being joined by an equal number, under the command of the earl of Shrewsbury, the lord Strange, with a considerable number of knights and gentlemen; he, with the advice of his council, determined to engage the rebels without delay. Guessing Lincoln's design upon the town of Newark, he marched thither with great expedition, and posted himself between the enemy and the town, while the earl of Lincoln encamped on the declivity of a hill near the village of Stoke. Next day, being the sixth of June, Henry drew up his army in order of battle upon the plain, which was so narrow, that he could not extend his front; and, therefore he was obliged to form his troops into three lines, placing his best men in the first, to the number of six thousand. The enemy did not decline the en∣gagement; on the contrary, they marched down in order, and attacked the royalists with great intrepidity, hoping, that should they be able to break the king's first line, it would fall back on the other two, and put the whole army in confusion. The naked Irish, tho' terribly galled by the English arrows, maintained their ground without flinching; and the German troops being well disciplined and inured to war, fought with great obstinacy for three hours suc∣cessively,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> until by far the greater part was slain, with Martin Swart their leader. The earls of Lincoln and Kildare met with the same fate; and their army was to∣tally routed, with the loss of four thousand men killed upon the field of battle. Nor was the victory cheaply purchased by the king, one half of whose first line was cut in pieces. Lambert Simnel and his tutor were taken prisoners; and Henry affected to despise his rival so much, that he would not deprive him of his life; but, retained him as a scullion in his kitchen, from which low station he was afterwards promoted to the place of a falconer. Simons the priest was committed to prison, and never heard of after his commitment. The lord Lovel is by some supposed to have been drowned in the Trent, endeavouring to ford that river after the battle; others affirm he was slain in the action; and a third set believe he passed the remainder of his life in a vault or cavern <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otion is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by a disco∣very made abo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixty years ago at this noble∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat of Min<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er-Lovel in Oxfordshire.

<P>Immediately after the battle, the king marched to Lincoln, from whence he advanced to York; and, in this progress severely punished all those who had favoured the rebels, or were convicted of having circulated a report, that the king's army was defeated: a report which had hindered some powerful succours from joining Henry before the battle. Those delinquents were tried partly by commissioners, and partly by martial law; but, the punishment fell upon their estates only, the king being satisfied with filling his coffers by fines and con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscations. When he had fleeced the malecontents in this manner, he procured a bull from the pope, impowering the archbishop of Canterbury to absolve them of the excommunication they had incurred by the former bull of settlement, as if he had been sollicitous about the salvation of those who sought his ruin. At the same time, Innocent VIII. sent over another bull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> restraining the privilege of sanctuaries within proper bounds. He ordained, that malefactors who had quitted the sanctuary to commit fresh crimes, and returned again to it for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>helter, might be forcibly taken from it by the king's officers: that, with respect to debtors who took sanctuary, in order to defraud their creditors, the privilege should extend to their persons only, and not to their estates; and that the king might sent guards into the sanctuary, to prevent the escape of traitors and rebels. While Henry resided at York, deputies ar∣rived from Scotland, to terminate some difference concerning the fishery of the river Esk; and the king took this opportunity of beginning a negotiation with James the Scottish monarch, to whose court he sent Fox bishop of Exeter, and Sir Richard Edgecomb, as his ambassadors, to treat of a triple alliance. The treaty was projected, and they agreed to the following articles: That the Scottish marquis of Ormond should marry Catherine daughter of the fourth Edward: That James himself should espouse Edward's widow: That his son the prince of Scotland should be matched with another daughter of that mo∣narch: That the king of England should cede for ever the town and ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle of Berwick to the Scots: That the articles and conditions of those three mar∣riages should be regulated by the commissioners of the two kings, to be as∣sembled at Edinburgh, first in January, and then in May: That the two kings should have an interview in the month of July: and, That the truce should be prolonged for thirteen months. Henry ratified these conventions on the twen∣tieth day of November: but, the execution of the treaty was prevented by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> troubles that ensued in Scotland.</P>

<P>The king in his journey to the North had occasion to perceive, that the discontents of the people proceeded in a great measure from his severity to the partisans of the house of York, and in particular, to his having so long delayed the queen's coronation. He therefore resolved to remove this subject of complaint. About the beginning of November he returned to London, which he entered in triumph; and next day went in procession to St. Paul's church, where Te Deum was sung for the victory he had obtained over the rebels. Then he appointed the duke of Bedford high steward for the corona∣tion of the queen, which was performed with the usual solemnities, on the twenty-fifth day of November, two years after her marriage. Upon this oc∣casion, he set at liberty the marquis of Dorset, without having brought him to any trial; and towards the latter end of the year, sent a solemn embassy to
<PB N="484" REF="4940"/>
the pope, with intimation of his marriage, and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers of service and spiritual obedience.</P>

<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>The war still continued in the Low Countries, where the troops of Charles VIII. surprized St. Omer and Terouenne, and the inhabitants of Ghent were incited by a nobleman, called Raffingham, to revolt against Maximilian. By this time Francis II. duke of Britanny, was old, infirm, and at certain times deprived of his senses: having no sons, he, with the consent of his estates, settled the succession upon his two daughters, Anne and Isabel, which last died before her father; so that Anne became sole heiress of Bretagne. Charles VIII. was desirous of uniting that dutchy with France, by marrying this princess; but his views were thwarted by Lewis duke of Orleans, whom he had persecuted at the instigation of his sister Madam de Beaujeu, and compelled to fly for shelter into Britanny, where he met with a very hospitable reception, and gained an ascendancy over Francis. This prince being incensed against his own nobility, who had put his favourite Landa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to death, gladly entertained the duke o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Or∣leans, with the prince of Orange, the count de Dunois, and some other French noblemen of that party; and the lords of Bretagne entered into a negotiation with Charles, though their motives were very different from those by which the Fre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch king was actuated when he concluded the alliance. He thought the treaty would furnish him with an opportunity to make a compleat conquest of Bretagne, while they hoped his protection would screen them from the resent∣ment and arbitrary designs of their own sovereign. In pursuance of this treaty, Charles invaded Britanny with six different armies; and the duke, retiring to Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>troit, assembled sixteen thousand men, with whom he began his march, to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentré.</NOTE> raise the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge of P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oermel, which the enemy had undertaken; but, as he ad∣vanced, he found himself abandoned by all his forces, except about four thou∣sand; and retreated with great precipitation to Nantz, which was besieged by the French after they had reduced Ploermel, Vannes, and Dinant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The duke had commissioned the count de Dunois, as his ambassador, to sollicit succours of the king of England; and that nobleman had embarked four different times on this embassy, but was always driven back by contrary winds or tempestuous weather.</P>

<P>While Charles was employed in the siege of Nantz he received ad∣vice of the victory which Henry had obtained at Stokefield, and immediately dispatched ambassadors to congratulate him upon his good fortune, and endeavour to dissuad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him from intermeddling in the affairs of Bretagne. They found him at Leicester, where they were admitted to an audience; in which, after the compliments of congratulation, they observed that the king their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overeign found himself obliged to engage in a war with the duke of Bri∣tanny, who had given protection to the duke of Orleans, the declared enemy of Charles; and even assisted him in exciting<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oubles in the kingdom of France: that therefore the duke of Britanny was in effect the aggressor; and the French king hoped, from the equity of Henry, that he would consider him in no other light. That, although the king had formerly lain under some obligations to the duke of Britanny, he would likewise remember the assistance he h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d received from the French monarch, at a time when the duke had not only abandoned his interest, but even agreed to deliver him into the hands of his enemy. For which reasons, Charles hoped the king of Eng∣land<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="485" REF="4950"/>
far from engaging in the defence of the duke of Britanny, who protected and encouraged the rebellious subjects of his neighbour prince, would espouse the interest of his real friend, or at least observe an exact neutrality. Henry was not ignorant of the design with which Charles had taken the field; but, as the French ambassadors had carefully avoided touching upon their master's real scheme of reuniting Britanny to the kingdom of France, he dissembled in his turn, and replied, That as the French king and the duke of Britanny were the two princes to whom he was more obliged than to all the world besides, he longed for an opportunity of manifesting his gratitude to both. He said he would, upon this occasion, fulfil the duty of a real friend, and endeavour to compromise their difference in an amicable manner. He did not imagine that Bretagne would be easily conquered. He did not doubt that Charles would accept of his mediation rather than incur his resentment; and he foresaw that this affair would furnish him with a pretence for demanding a subsidy, which he should have no occasion to expend.</P>

<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>In these sentiments he dispatched ambassadors with offers of his mediation to king Charles; and, should these be accepted, they were ordered to proceed to the duke of Bretagne with the same proposal. Charles was then employed in the siege of Nantz; and, as it was his interest to amuse Henry until the place should be taken, he not only accepted his mediation, but also offered to submit the dispute to his final decision; hoping either that the duke of Britanny would reject the arbitration, or that the negotiation might be spun out until he should be master of the dutchy. When the English am∣bassadors proposed their master's mediation to the duke, who was besieged in Nantz, the duke of Orleans replied, in the name of that prince, that in such a perilous conjuncture, he expected substantial assistance from the king of Eng∣land, rather than offers of mediation, which could not prevent the loss of his dominions: he desired their king would remember the benefits he had receiv∣ed from the duke of Britanny, and consider how much it imported England to hinder that dutchy from becoming a province of France. With this an∣swer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentré.</NOTE> the ambassadors were dismissed, and Charles triumphed greatly in his affected moderation. Mean while he carried on his attacks with such vigour, that the place must have been surrendered, had not the count de Dunoi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> assembled a great multitude of peasants, who were anxious about the fate of their sovereign, and relieved the town in the face of the French army. This supply obliged Charles to raise the siege; and Henry being now fully persuaded that the French king would not be able to conquer Britanny, resolved to con∣tinue neuter; but at the same time affected to interest himself warmly in the duke's favour, that he might have a pretext for demanding a subsidy from the parliament which he had convoked for the ninth day of November. Mean while he sent back the ambassadors to renew their efforts for a negotiation.</P>

<P>The lord Wideville, the queen's uncle, sollicited the king's per∣mission to engage in the service of the duke of Britanny with a number of vo∣luntiers; and, though Henry denied his request, he embarked privately at the Isle of Wight with four hundred men, who were no sooner land<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the duke's dominions, than Charles complained of them to the English ambassadors, as a body of auxiliaries sent in violation of the neutrality which the king of England affected to maintain. Henry, however, disavowing this step of the lord Wide∣ville,
<PB N="486" REF="4960"/>
as a clandestine tran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>action, Charles was satisfied, because it was not his interest to break with the king of England at such a juncture; for by this time the noblemen of Britanny, perceiving the intention of the French king was to make a conquest of their country, had made peace with their sovereign, who could not however prevent Charles from taking the town of Dol by assault; so that the duke, thinking himself unsafe at Nantz, retired to Rennes, in hope of being succoured by some of his allies: there finding himself hard pressed by the enemy, and seeing no prospect of immediate assistance, he suffered himself to be persuaded by the prince of Orange to promise he would bestow his daugh∣ter Anne in marriage upon the king of the Romans; and that prince engaged to bring a powerful army into Bretagne; but he was prevented by the revolt of Ghent, which employed all his forces in Flanders.</P>

<P>During these transactions on the continent, the English ambassadors returned to London, and reported to Henry that the intention of Charles was to amuse him with a negotiation until Bretagn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be conquered. The parliament meeting at Westminster, the session was opened with a speech by the archbishop of Canterbury, chancellor of the realm, who, in the king's name, having thanked the two houses for the acts they had passed in his ta∣vour at their last <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting, gave them to understand, that with respect to the war between France and Bret<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gne, Charles had desired he would observe a neu∣trality, and the duke had sollicited his assistance: that he had offered his media∣tion, which was accepted by the French king, on condition that he should not discontinue hostilities, until the difference should be compromised; but that this condition was rejected by the duke of Britanny, who distrusted the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ncerity of Charles, and observed that his aim was to spin out the negotiation until the dutchy should be subdued: that after having ineffectually employed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is best offices to terminate the dispute by an accommodation, he begged the advice of his parliament; and desired they would consider whether or not he ought to interpose more effectual measures for the preservation of Bretaghe. This was a question that required very little consideration: the English were too jealous of the power of France to stand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amely, and see it augmented by the accession of such a maritime province, which they counselled the king to defend with all his might; and that he might be enabled to assist the duke effectually, they granted a supply of two fifteenths, besides a poll tax upon aliens, and ano∣ther act of resumption. In this session they confirmed the authority of the Star∣chamber, a court which had hitherto subsisted by the antient common laws of the realm. It consisted of the members of the king's council, who sat in an apartment called the Star-chamber, to judge offences u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der the degree of capital. The parliament likewise enacted a statute, by which any servant of the king, under the degree of a nobleman, conspiring the death of any member of the council, or lord of the realm, should be deemed guilty of a capital crime.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on.

A law was made for the more effectual prevention of murder and manslaughter. Another statute ordained that clerks convicted should be burned in the hand, for a taste of punishment and brand of infamy, from which they had been hi∣therto exempted. A third decreed that the king's officers and farmers should fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>feit their places and holds, in case of unlawful retainer, or being concerned

in riots and illegal assemblies. Several wholesome regulations were made for the prevention of usury, the security of the king's customs, and the employment of foreign commodities imported into the kingdom.</P>

<P>Henry having accomplished his aim, which was a subsidy, instead of employing it in vigorous measures, resumed the method of negotiation, and sent ambassadors again to Charles, to make him acquainted with the resolution of the parliament. The French king, who was no stranger to Henry's senti∣ments and disposition, still continued to amuse him by declaring himself ready to abide by the decision of the king of England; but he absolutely refused to interrupt his operations, alledging that such interruption would enable his ad∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsary to retrieve his affairs: nevertheless the duke of Bretagne gained by the approach of winter what he could not obtain by Henry's sollicitations. The king of France was obliged to put his troops in quarters, and return to Paris: while the duke not only enjoyed a respite, but, by the valour and activity of the mareschal Rieux, retook Vannes and Dinan, in the month of March, and secu∣red<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1488.</NOTE> Ancennis and Chateaubriant with strong garrisons: at the same time a small body of men at arms, belonging to the lord of Albret, deserted the service of France, and joined the duke of Britanny. This smile of fortune was of short<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> duration: in the month of April Charles began the campaign, retook and de∣molished Ancennis and Chateaubriant, and at one time invested Fougeres and St. Aubin de Cormier. In the beginning of the war the duke of Bretagne had endeavoured to detach the lord of Albret from the interest of France, by promising to give him his daughter in marriage; and now that nobleman em∣bracing the proposal, joined him with a body of a thousand horse, in expecta∣tion of seeing his promise immediately fulfilled. Francis, who had in private betrothed his daughter to Maximilian, tutored the princess, who was about eleven years of age, to express a personal aversion to the match; and this served as a pretence for delaying the marriage. Mean while, finding himself a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gether unable to cope with the French, and being disappointed in his expectations from Henry and the king of the Romans, he sent the count de Dunois to sollicit Charles for peace. That king was then engaged in a private negotiation for a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> truce with the king of England; and therefore deferred giving a positive answer, on various pretences, until he received advice that the treaty was concluded at Windsor: then having nothing to fear from Henry, he rejected the duke's proposals, and resolved to continue the war until he should have made an in∣tire conquest of the dutchy. The duke's affairs being now desperate, his chief counsellors, the duke of Orleans, the prince of Orange, and the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>echal Rieux, resolved to make one vigorous effort, by giving battle to the enemy. With this view they marched towards St. Aubin, which had capitulated before they ar∣rived; and the French army being reunited under the command of Lewis de la Tremouille, a battle ensued on the twenty-eighth day of July, when the forces of Britanny were rou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with great slaughter: the duke of Orleans and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> the prince of Orange, who fought on foot, were taken prisoners, and the lord Wideville was slain, with all his followers.</P>

<P>While the duke of Bretagne thus precipitated his own ruin, the king of England made his distress a pretext for levying the subsidy with the ut∣most expedition; and all the counties payed it without murmuring, except the inhabitants of Yorkshire and the bishopric of Durham, who, as old par∣tisan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="488" REF="4980"/>
of the house of York, hated Henry, and refused to comply with the con∣ditions of the tax, which they said was a grievous oppression. The commis∣sioners, being thus repulsed, addressed themselves to the earl of Northumber∣land, who wrote to court for directions; and the king insisted peremptorily on their paying their proportion of the subsidy which had been granted by par∣liament; observing that the affairs of Bretagne were very pressing; and that, should he relinquish his right on this occasion, other counties would be en∣couraged to claim the same exemption. The earl no sooner received this an∣swer, than he assembled the justices and freeholders of the county, and signi∣fied his majesty's pleasure in such imperious terms, as not only confirmed them in their resolution to refuse payment, but also excited their resentment against the earl, whom they considered as the person who had fomented the king's in∣dignation. Thus instigated, the populace immmediately assembled, and, break∣ing into his house, slew him with a good number of his servants. They were ani∣mated by a popular incendiary called John a Chamber, and choosing for their leader Sir John Egremont, a very turbulent partisan of the house of York, they avo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed their rebellion; declaring they would march to London, and give battle to Henry. The news of this insurrection did not much alarm the king, though <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e forthwith sent a body of troops against the rebels, under the com∣mand of the earl of Surrey, whom he had released from the Tower, and ad∣mitted into his favour. That nobleman, engaging the insurgents, routed them at the first onset, and made John a Chamber prisoner; but Sir John Egre∣mont escaped, and, crossing the sea, took refuge with the dutchess dowager of Burgu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy. The king, who followed the earl of Surrey with another body of troops, proceeded in his progress northward as far as York, where he ordered John a Chamber to be hanged, with a great number of his accomplices, and granted a general pardon to the rest of the rebels. Having constituted the earl S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrey his lieutenant in the northern parts, and appointed Sir Richard Tun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tall his pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cipal commissioner for levying the subsidy, he returned to London, where he was surprized with the tidings of the duke of Bretagne's being de∣feated at St. Aubin.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>That prince was now reduced to a deplorable condition: he had nothing to expect from Henry but frui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>less negotiations. Maximilian, instead of succouring his future father-in-law, was himself imprisoned by the Flemings at Bruges, and remained in confinement until his father Frederick, the empe∣ror, marched into the Low Countries at the head of a numerous army to his re∣lief. He was so intent upon fortifying himself against the mutinous spirit of the Flemings, that, forgetting all his engagements with the duke of Britanny, he sent an emb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssy into Spain to demand of Ferdinand and his queen their eldest da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghter Isabel for himself, and the younger infanta Jane for his son Philip: the former was already promised to the prince of Portugal, but the second part of his proposal took effect in the sequel. Mean while Philip de Cleves, lord of Ravenstein, being chosen general by the inhabitants of Ghent, surprized the city of Brussels; and Maximilian retired to Germany, leaving Albert duke of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xony to comma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for his son Philip in the Low Countries.

That politic monarch, though he h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cluded a truce with Henry, perceived
<PB N="489" REF="4990"/>
from the temper of the English nation, that their king would find himself obliged to take some vigorous measures for the defence of Britanny<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and those he resolved to prevent by a treaty with the duke, which he would no farther observe, than he should find it convenient for his own purposes: their confe∣rences were accordingly opened; and about the latter end of August a treaty of peace was concluded at Vorger, on condition that Charles should retain the places he had conquered, and withdraw his troops from the other parts of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<HEAD>§ XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>Immediately after the ratification of this treaty, Francis II. duke of Britanny died in a very old age, leaving his daughter Anne under the tuition of the marechal de Rieux and the count de Cominge: but Philip de Mon∣tauban chancellor of the dutchy carried the young princess to Guerande, where he made use of her name and authority to cloak his own designs; and his influence with her produced a quarrel between him and the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rechal, which proved very detrimental to her own interest, as well as to that of her subjects. The king of England, being informed of the duke's death, declared openly that he would consider the interest of the orphan dutchess as his own, and af∣fected to make preparations for succouring her in the most effectual manner. As the late treaty between France and Brittany was provisional, until the pre∣tensions of Charles to the sovereignty of that dutchy could be regulated, Hen∣ry's aim was to hinder the French king from taking the advantage of the duke's death, and the consternation of the Bretons. He thought this purpose would be answered by his openly espousing the cause of the dutchess; that Charles, rather than come to an open rupture with England, would abate in his preten∣sions; that he himself would be chosen umpire of the difference, and conse∣quently avoid a war which would oblige him to empty his coffers. In order to intimidate the French king, he sent ambassadors to the king of the Romans and his son Philip the archduke, and dispatched envoys to the kings of Spain and Portugal, as if he intended to form a league against Charles, whom, by a third embassy, he pressed to finish all difference with Bretagne by a new treaty; at the same time, he sent Edgecomb and Henry Ay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esworth with offers of assistance to the young dutchess, and powers to engage in his name for a certain number of troops, on sufficient security for a reimbursement of the expence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>The affairs of Britanny engrossed the attention of the kings of England and France to such a degree, that they neglected sending succours to their ally James III. king of Scotland, whose nobles, with his son at their head, had risen in rebellion. He had retired to the castle of Edinburgh, and solli∣cited the assistance of Charles and Henry, who promised to send forces to his aid; but his friends advised him to remove to the castle of Stirling, which he would find more commodious for receiving the succours he expected from abroad. In compliance with this advice, he quitted Edinburgh, and marched with a small body of troops to Stirling, where he was refused admittance by the governor. He then endeavoured to return to the place from which he had departed; but was prevented by the rebellious noblemen who had engaged him at Bannockburn, where he was defeated and slain. His son James, at that time but fifteen years of age, was proclaimed king of Scotland on the field of battle by the victors; and in the month of July sent ambassadors to Henry, to notify his accession to the Scottish throne. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bucha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> On the tenth day of February, the English envoys concluded a treaty with the dutchess of Bretagne, by which Henry engaged to assist her with a reinforcement of six thousand men, on condition of being put in pos∣session<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> of certain places, by way of security for the expence of this armament: so that by this negotiation he provided for the safety of Bretagne, without ex∣pending any part of the money he had received from parliament; on the con∣trary, he contrived a method <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or laying it out to the best advantage; for by re∣taining the securities, he found means to be repayed with interest. The dutchess was glad to receive the assistance of England upon any terms. She saw a French army in the heart of her dominions: she found herself without troops and money; and her principal subjects were divided among themselves, by the most rancorous feuds and factions. The marechal de Rieux had been appointed her tuto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; but Philip de Montauban her chancellor, who had gained an as∣cendency over her spirit, represented the marechal to her in such a light, that she refused to own him as her guardian. Philip in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inuated that he was a creature of the king of France, by whose direction he wanted to effect a marriage be∣tween her and the lord of Albret, a nobleman unsupported by any alliance, who would not be able to protect her dominions. The marechal was so incensed against this rival, that he had not only refused to admit the dutchess into Nantz,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>é.</NOTE> but even threatened to besiege her in Rennes, the place of her ordinary residence. No wonder then that Montauban, who was at the head of the administration, concluded such a treaty with the king of England, the arrival of whose suc∣cours would so strongly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortify his interest.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The English troops being landed in Brittany in the month of March, the French king began to think that Henry intended to act with vi∣gour in defence of the dutchess; and from the embassies to so many different powers, he no longer doubted that his aim was to form a powerful confederacy against France. By the mediation of the German princes, assembled at Franck∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, a treaty was brought upon the anvil, for a pacification between him and Maximilian, as well as between Maximilian and the Flemings. He had in his power Margaret daughter of the king of the Romans, whom by treaty he was obliged to marry, as soon as she should be of age; and he was entirely ig∣norant of the private contract between the late duke of Bretagne and Maximi∣lian, touching the marriage of the duke's daughter. He therefore did not doubt, that his future father-in-law would be favourable to his interest; and in this opinion proposed to the dutchess Anne, that their difference should be le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the arbitration of Maximilian. Her ministry joyfully embraced this propo∣sal, in full confidence that she would be favoured by a prince destined to be her husband; and the king of the Romans was very well pleased with this oppor∣tunity of acting as umpire, in an affair that so nearly concerned his own interest. The envoys of the two parties assembling at Franckfort, soon concluded, under Maximilian's arbitration, a provisional treaty, importing, That Charles should restore all the places he had conquered in Brittany, except Dinan, St. Aubin, Fougeres, and St. Malo, which should be deposited in the hands of Maximilian and the duke of Bourbon; and that the French troops should evacuate all the other parts of the dutchy: That Anne should send back the English troops: That in April of the succeeding year, a congress should be held at Tournay, where all differences should be determined; and, in the mean time, the parties
<PB N="491" REF="5010"/>
should send their reasons to Avignon, to be examined and discussed by civilians, that their opinions might serve as instructions to their mediators. Though the articles of this treaty were agreeable to both parties, it proved ineffectual. The places which Anne had delivered by way of security to Henry, were garrisoned by five hundred English troops; and though the other auxiliaries of that na∣tion returned to their own country after the treaty with France, these five hun∣dred would not quit Brittany until the king of England should be reimbursed; a condition which the dutchess could not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulfil. There the affair rested; and neither party sent reasons to Avignon, or ambassadors to Tournay. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE></P>

<P>Mean while the marriage between Maximilian and the young dutchess was negotiated with all possible secrecy; and at length solemnized in the month of November, the prince of Nassau acting as proxy for the king of the Romans, and putting his naked leg in bed with the dutchess, as a proof of consummation; but this affair was transacted with such privacy, that neither Charles of France nor Henry of England had the least intimation of it for a whole year after the ceremony was performed. Anne, foreseeing that the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would be renewed as soon as her marriage should be divulged, sent the chan∣cellor of Montauban and other envoys, to demand succours of Henry; and en∣gage, in her name, that she would never marry without his knowlege and con∣sent. They were likewise instructed to inform him of her formal protest against<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1490.</NOTE> the contract which had been made by her father, touching her marriage with the lord of Albret; and to insinuate that, as the marechal de Rieux espoused the interest of that nobleman, her dutchy was in as great danger from her own subjects, as from the French monarch. This remonstrance had no effect upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> Henry, who, instead of accommodating the dutchess with new succours, sent another embassy into France, to treat with king Charles about the termination of all the differences subsisting between him and Anne of Britanny. He was persuaded that Charles dreaded his junction with the dutchess so much, that he would not only be glad to embrace equitable proposals of peace, but even to purchase it at any price he should think proper to impose: in this opinion he ordered his ambassadors to demand the arrears of the pension which Lewis XI. had agreed to pay to Edward IV. by the treaty of Pequigny. In the mean time, he appointed commissioners to treat with the envoys from Britanny; and the whole result of the negotiation was a further security for the money he had already disbursed. With respect to the succours she demanded, there was no article in the treaty. He confined himself to verbal promises, that he would never abandon the dutchess. Imagining that Charles was sincerely desirous of peace, he thought such succours were altogether unnecessary: but having still an eye to the reimbursement of his money, he demanded that the town of Nantz should be put into his power, on pretence that it was in danger of falling into the hands of the French; and he promised faithfully to restore it on the first requisition. Before he could gain this point, however, the lord of Albret, having resigned all hope of espousing the dutchess, surprized that rich city, and embraced the French party. Charles mean while amused the English ambas∣sadors with evasive professions, in order to gain time, that he might be able to terminate the war to his own advantage, without referring the dispute to Henry, whose arbitration he had no mind to adopt.</P>

<P>During these negotiations, the duke of Saxony, who commanded in the Low-Countries in the name of Maximilian, published an edict touching the coin, to which the inhabitants of Bruges refused to submit; and those of Ghent joined in their revolt. The king of France, whose constant aim was to soment domestic troubles in the dominions of his neighbours, sent succours to the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bels, under the command of marechal D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>squerdes governor of Picardy; and, on the other hand, Maximilian sent ambassadors to Henry to form a<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> league against Charles. The king of England, piqued at the indifference with which his ambassadors were treated in France, and unwilling to see the arch∣duke oppressed by his own subjects, sent a reinforcement of a thousand men to Calais; and ordered the lord Daubigney, governor of that fortress, to march to the relief of Dixmuyd, which the Flemings, with the assistance of the French, had invested, after having taken Ypres and Sluys. Daubigney no sooner re∣ceived this order, than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e marched at the head o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two thousand men, and threw himself into Dixmuyd in the night, without opposition. At day-break, he made a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally at the opposite gate, and falling upon the camp of the confederates, routed them entirely. This affair produced great coldness between the kings of France and England; but Charles durst not complain, because Henry had as good a right to support the sovereign as he had to assist the rebellious subjects. The English monarch, finding Charles still more and more averse to an accom∣modation with the dutchess of Bretagne, thought proper to take such public <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as would intimidate that prince into more pacific resolutions. In the beginning of the year he had renewed the treaties of alliance with Portugal and Denmark. In September, he concluded with Maximilian and his son Philip a league against France, for their mutual defence and that of the dutchess of Brit∣tany. At the same time he published a treaty concluded with Ferdinand and Isabella sovereigns of Spain; by which the two parties engaged to maintain a war against France, until Charles should have resto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Roussillon to Ferdinand, and Guienne and Nor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndy to Henry. They likewise agreed that Arthur prince of Wales should wed Catherine infanta of Spain, as soon as the parties<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> should be marriageable. The league with the king of the Romans referred to this treaty; and those three princes engaged to invade France at one time, each at the head of a separate army, to act for the interest of the alliance, and the defence of the dutchess of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etagne. This league, however, was no more than a bugbear, raised to terrify Charles into pacific measures. It was with the same view, that Henry concluded a treaty of alliance with John Galeazo duke of Milan. Nor was this artifice altogether unsuccessful. The French king began to be afraid of a league, which would not only interrupt him in the conquest of Bretagne, but also baffle those designs which he had for some time meditated upon the kingdom of Naples This apprehension hindered him from recommencing hostilities in Bretagne, though he had a strong army in the heart of that province, and the dutchess was in no condition to check his progress.</P>

<P>Perplexed by these suggestions he resolved to send an embassy into England, on pretence of endeavouring to detach Henry from the interest of Anne, but in reality to learn what he had to hope or to fear from the English monarch. For this purpose he chose Francis de Luxembourg, viscount de Martigues, Valeran de Sams, and Robert Gaguin, minister-general of the

order of the trinity. These ambassadors arriving in England, had an audience of the king at London, at which nothing material was transacted: but Richard Fox bishop of Exeter, Thomas earl of Ormond, and some others, being ap∣pointed commissioners to treat with them, the general of the trinity, at their first conference, in a very humble speech observed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he and his colleagues were sent to demand peace of the king of England, for whom Charles had the most profound esteem; that their master proposed to make a conquest of Na∣ples, which was unjustly detained from him by a bastard of the house of Ar∣ragon; and that, after having finished that enterprize, his intention was to carry his arms into the east, and overthrow the Ottoman empire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that in these sentiments he made no scruple to demand peace of all the European princes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he might not, by their means, be diverted from the execution of a project that would redound so much to the glory and advantage of the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ian reli∣gion; and finally, that, as a mark of his eager desire to maintain a good cor∣respond<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce with the king of England, he, though undoubted lord paramount of Bretagne, and consequently intitled to the wardship of the dutche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desired that king Henry would consent to his disposing of her in marriage as he should think proper. To this lowly remo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>strance, the chancellor, in the king's name, made a very lofty reply. He said the good understanding between his master and the French king, was not to be restored by words but by actions<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that, with respect to the marriage of Anne dutchess of Britanny, king Henry had no intention to intermeddle in the affair, provided Charles would act by the law and not by the sword; and as for his designs upon the kingdom of Naples, he would only make one observation, which was, that if Charles thought his ho∣nour engaged to recover that realm, he could not be surprized that the king of England should do his utmost endeavour to retrieve the possession of Guienne, Normandy, and the whole kingdom of France, which was his lawful inheri∣tance. The French ambassadors, surprized at this declaration, answered with some warmth, that the king their sovereign was not afraid of such menaces, and knew how to defend his just rights against any prince or person who should attempt to invade them. The chancellor replied without emotion, that the king expected no other answer from them, but that he would in a little time send ambassadors into France, in order to explain his intentions to their master. Mean while he asked if Charles would be contented, should the king of England consent to his disposing of the dutchess of Bretagne in marriage, with an exclusion of his own person. To this question the ambassadors replied, that their king was so<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> far from entertaining any thought of espousing the dutchess, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad given them no instructions on the subject. Henry, upon this occasion, spun his thread of politics too fine. His intention was to intimidate Charles; and for that purpose, he made use of a rhodomontade which produced a contrary effect. The French king knew he was too wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to embark in such an enterprize as the conquest of France; and therefore interpreted his menaces into an artifice for deterring him from the conquest of Britanny, which he resolved to prosecute without further hesitation.</P>

<P>In the month of February, the king, according to his promise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Anne. Thinking it un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecessary to conceal her marriage longer from the know∣lege of Henry, who assumed the name of her protector, she sent a solemn de∣putation, composed of the prince of Orange, the count de Dunois, and the chancel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, to notify her marriage with Maximilian, and sollicit immediate succour of the king of England. Charles was no sooner informed of this match, than he besieged the dutchess in her capital city of Rennes; and during the siege, which lasted several months, she sent repeated envoys to Henry, de∣manding assistance. He made use of these pressing sollicitations, as a pretence for raising loans of mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey through the whole kingdom. He renewed the league with Ferdinand and Maximilian, who sent two thousand men to the assistance of his wife, while his allies engaged to enter France at the head of two good armies, by the month of June in the following year. Not that either of these allies intended to fulfil this engagement. Ferdinand was otherwise employed in the war of Grenada; the king of the Romans was destitute of troops and money; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Henry, perceiving at last that Bretagne must certainly be con∣quered, would by no means engage alone in its defence. Their views there∣fore in this alliance had a very different termination. Ferdinand hoped his league with Henry would induce Charles to purchase his forbearance with the restitution of Rousillon. The king of the Romans wanted to involve Fer∣dinan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Henry in a war, of which he would reap the whole fruit, without bearing any share of the labour; and the sole aim of Henry was, by the terror of this triple alliance, to extort from Charles security for the payment of the demands which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had upon France and Brittany.</P>

<P>The French king, without being much disturbed by these nego∣tiations, continued the siege of Rennes; but, as he made little progress in his operations, and the season was already far advanced, he took a more e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icacious method to secure the possession of Bretagne. He bribed all the counsellors of the young dutchess, to persuade her to renounce her marriage with Maximilian, and receive himself as her husband. The princess, who was then about fifteen years of age, at first resisted all their sollicitations, observing that she could not in honour abandon a prince whom she had voluntarily married. But they al∣ledged that Maximilian had abandoned her, in relinquishing her interest and living quietly in Germany, without offering to come in person and undertake her defence, or sending succours proportioned to her occasions. They repre∣sented that, considering the present situation of affairs, Brittany would certainly become a province of France, and Maximilian would manifest still less regard for her, when he should see her stripped of her dominions; so that she would have the completed mortification to lose her husband and her dutchy, and see her subjects reduced to slavery: that in marrying the king of France she might secure to herself the sovereignty of Bretagne, and preserve the liberty of her people: and that the age of Charles was more suitable to her own than that of Maximilian, who was already advanced in years. The king of France, find∣ing her deaf to all these remonstrances, devised another expedient to overcome her obstinacy. Knowing what an ascendency the duke of Orleans had gained over the mind of this young princess, he released him from the tower of Bourges, in which he had been confined since the battle of St. Aubin, on condition that he should employ all his influence with the dutchess, in obtaining her consent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the marriage. The duke, tired of his imprisonment, readily undertook the
<PB N="495" REF="5050"/>
office, and repairing to Rennes, actually reconciled the dutchess to the pro∣posal;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentre. Mezerai.</NOTE> so that the match was concluded on the sixteenth day of December.</P>

<P>While this affair was in agitation, Charles continued to amuse the English ambassadors, who were no sooner informed of the purposed mar∣riage, than they retired without taking leave, and reported their discovery to Henry, who was not a little confounded at finding himself so egregiously du∣ped, and in such danger of losing the money which he had expended in the de∣fence of Bretagne. Nevertheless, he had still another advantage over Charles, of which he did not fail to avail himself. That prince had projected the conquest of Naples; and as a rupture in England would have greatly interfered with the execution of his design, he sought to avoid it with the utmost care and circumspection. Henry, being well acquainted with his views, affected the warmest resentment of the affront he had received, and threatened vengeance against the author. As soon as his ambassadors had made their report, he issued orders for levying troops and preparing transports, and declared he would forthwith carry the war into the bowels of France. Maximilian breathed nothing but revenge, when he understood that he was deprived of his wife in such an outrageous manner: he, like Henry, threatened to lay waste the kingdom of France with fire and sword; and the archduke Philip de∣manded that his sister Margaret, who had been betrothed to Charles, might be sent back from Paris, where she resided for her education. The court of France however would not as yet comply with this demand, and seemed to disregard the threats of father and son by the most supercilious neglect. All the attention of Charles was employed in averting the storm with which he was threatened from Spain and England; for, by this time, Ferdinand and Isabella had finished the war against the Moors with the reduction of Grenada, and loudly menaced France with an invasion. Henry seemed actually in earnest<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> in his preparations for war. That his dominions might be secure on the side of Scotland, he concluded a truce at Coldstream with the ambassadors of James IV. sovereign of that kingdom. In the beginning of the year he assembled a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1492.</NOTE> parliament, to which he declared in person his resolution to recover the kingdom of France, as the inheritance of his ancestors. He reminded the members of the victories gained at Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt, by a small number of English over the most powerful armies of France; men∣tioned the different powers that were ready to co-operate with his measures in attacking that kingdom; demanded a supply suitable to the greatness of the occasion, exhorting the commons to spare the purse of the poor, and let the burthen of the tax fall upon the wealthy. Though the commons had very little reason to grant a subsidy, considering how the last was embezzled, the conquest of France was such a temptation as they could not resist. They not only advised him to engage in this enterprize, which in reality he had no mind to undertake, but they supplied him with uncommon alacrity; and, according to his desire, impowered him to raise a benevolence from the weal∣thy part of his subjects. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>After the session broke up, the king received an embassy from Charles of France, with certain proposals, the nature of which never transpired; tho' in all probability, those envoys laid the foundation of that peace which was concluded before the end of the year. In the month of June, the queen
<PB N="496" REF="5060"/>
was delivered of a second son called Henry, who succeeded his father on the throne of England. Immediately after that event, the king sent a reinforce∣ment of two and twenty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps, and two thousand five hundred men, to the arch∣duke Philip, who had marched against Philip de Cleves the leader of the revolted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> That chief retiring to Sluys, was there besieged, and so hard pres∣sed by the English auxiliaries, that he was obliged to sue for peace, and sur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>der the town to the archduke. Henry, who had no intention to prosecute the war with vigour, soon began to flag in his preparations; and sent ambassadors to France on pretence of manifesting his desire to terminate the dispute by fair means, before he would u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sheath the sword of vengeance: at the same time, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dispatched envoys to summon Maximilian and Ferdinand, to invade France <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to their engagements. But, he knew very well they had neither the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nor the power to comply with the articles of the treaty. Maximi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian was desticute of troops, and Ferdinand had actually begun a negotiation with Charles, for the restitution of Roussillon. In the beginning of August, Hentry issued new orders for fresh levies; and, in the course of the same month, the appointed commissioners, to treat with the Scottish deputies at Coldstream, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a solid peace between the two nations. At length, he constituted his son Arthur prince of Wales guardian of the kingdom; and in the begin∣ning of October repaired to Sandwich, where he embarked his army. Before he went on board, he received a letter from the marechal Desquerdes, propos∣ing that a negotiation for peace might be carried on in England: but, the king <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esol <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to negotiate in France, in order to save appearances.</P>

He had scarce arrived at Calais, when his ambassadors returned from the king of the Romans, with an account of that prince's being altoge∣ther <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ble to fulfil his engagements; and in a few days after their arrival, he received letters from his envoys in Spain, giving him to understand, that Fer∣di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd had made peace with Charles, on condition of being re-established in<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> possession of Roussillon.

He now permitted, tho' with seeming <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the bishop of Bath and Wells, and the lord Daubigney, governor of Calais, to open a congress with the marechal Desquerdes at Estaples; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e himself began his march for Boulogne, which he invested on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th day of October.

<P>In eight days after Henry undertook this siege, he received the articles of peace concluded between the commissioners of both kingdoms, to this effect: That the king of France should discharge the debt contracted by his queen for the defence of Britanny: That he should moreover pay to Henry the arrears of the pension which his father granted to Edward IV. That, as there was no sum specified in the obligation of the dutchess of Britanny to the king of England, this last should produce vouchers of his accounts to French commissioners, who should be sent to England for that purpose: That the two

Though these articles were extremely agreeable to Henry, he affected to hesitate and start objections; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> length referred them to the consideration of a general council, composed of all the noble<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en and principal offi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers in the army. These were influen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d and directed by s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of his own creatures, and unanimously gave it as their opinion, that the co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di∣tion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ought to be accepted. The king, pretending to be determined by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he advice of the council, confirmed the treaty, which was ratified in like manner by Charles; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d both sovereign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> undertook for its receiving the sanction of the estates of their respective realms. The nature of this peace pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inly proves that the war was undertaken solely with a view to the payment of the money expended in defence of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etagne, and the revival of the pension; for there is not one word in the articles relating to Henry's title to Guienne, Normandy, and the crown of France, which was his pretence for beginning the war. It was stipulated th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the treaty should remain in force till the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath of both kings; and that the successor of him who should die first should ratify the peace within a year after his accession to the throne.

This treaty between France and England g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve great umbrage to Henry's subjects, who not only repined at Britanny's being annexed to the French crown, but also complained that he had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced his people for the maintenance of a war which he undertook merely with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w to fill his own coffers.

After having resided some years in England, he was by his parents conveyed to Flanders, where he consorted chiefly with English company, so as to preserve his original language; and as he grew up, he exhibited such accomplishments both of body and understanding as recom∣mended him to the notice of Margaret dutchess of Burgundy, who resolved to play him off as a pretender to the crown of England. For thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> purpose she tu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ored him in private, until he was perfectly instructed wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h regard to the deport∣ment he should assume.

He was immediately joined by a great number of partisans, and wrote to the earls of Desmond and Kildare, exhorting them to acknowledge his title, and join him with their vassals and dependants. Charles VIII. was no sooner informed of his appearance in Ireland, than he sent Stephen Tryon, who had been formerly in Henry's ser∣vice, and one Lucas, as ambassadors to Perkin, to assure him of his protection, and invite him to his court.

The French king would not violate the laws of hospitality, though he promised that he should have no as∣sistance from Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce in his designs upon the English throne. Perkin, being thu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cut off from all hope of succour at the court of France, re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired to Flanders, and addressed himself as a stranger to the dutchess dowager.

<PB N="499" REF="5090"/>
of his being the real duke of York. She forthwith acknowledged him as her nephew, distinguished him by the title of the White Rose of England, appointed a guard for his person, and treated him in all respects as the true heir of the English throne. When these circumstances were known in England, the people were extremely well inclined to adopt the imposture, partly through hatred to the king, but chiefly from a persuasion that Perkin was the real Richard Plantagenet. Sir William Stanley, lord chamberlain of the household, the lord Fitzwalter, Sir Simon Montfort, Sir Thomas Thwaites, and others, engaged in a secret conspiracy to favour this youth's title, and sent over Sir Robert Clifford and W. Bailey, of Aldeburgh in Hertfordshire, to learn the truth of what was transacted at the court of Margaret dutchess of Burgundy. Sir Robert had several conferences with this princess on the subject, After having conversed frequently with Perkin, he wrote a letter to his confederates, in which he declared that he knew the person of the duke of York as well as he knew his own; and that this youth was undoubtedly the true Richard Plantagenet.</P>

<P>Henry was not idle at this juncture; he had received a confu∣sed intimation of the conspiracy, and employed emissaries abroad to insinuate themselves into the confidence of Perkin and his protectress, that they might learn the particulars of the pretender's birth and education, as well as the names of those who favoured him in England. That those spies might be screened from all suspicion among the partisans of Perkin, he caused them to be excom∣municated at St. Paul's, by name, in the bead-roll of the king's enemies, ac∣cording to the custom of the times; and he tampered with the chaplains and confessors of his nobility, in order to discover their secret inclinations. While he took these measures for discovering and defeating the conspiracy, he was equally industrious in finding out and promulgating proofs of the real duke of York's having been murdered in the Tower. Sir James Tyrrel, who had been one of Henry's plenipotentiaries in France; and his servant Dighton, said to have been concerned in that tragedy, were examined, and confessed the fact, as it hath been related in the history of the preceding reign: but, how∣ever, their account left the affair in some perplexity, and the king made no use of it in any of his declarations. Dighton however was set at liberty, and earned his pardon by divulging this tradition; which, in all probability, was invented for the purpose. All the intelligence that Henry obtained abroad amounted to no more than the same detail which we have repeated; and therefore it did not fully answer his end, which was to convince the world of the imposture: on the contrary, it served to confirm the opinion of many people in favour of Perkin, because it was so defective and ill-attested. They concluded, from Henry's known sagacity, that if the youth had really been an impostor, he would have traced him from his cradle to his appearance in the character of Richard Plantagenet, in such a manner as would have left no doubt of his identity. They could hardly believe that Charles king of France, and the dutchess of Burgundy, would have prostituted the dignity<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> of princes so far, as to bestow it upon a common adventurer; and they took it for granted, that if the duke of York had been actually murdered in the Tower, king Henry would have been able to prove the fact so clearly
<PB N="5$0" REF="5100"/>
as to confute the pretensions of any counterfeit. There was something very mysterious in the king's conduct upon this occasion; for the intelligence he pretended to have received from his spies abroad, touching the life and ad∣ventures of Perkin War<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, was not published by proclamation, or in any other authentic manner; but circulated in vague and contradictory reports by the courtiers and their adherents. With respect to the death of the real duke of York, Henry's ambassador at the court of the archduke, when desired to produce the evidence, said his master declined that sort of proof, because it might be said he had tutored the witnesses. These circumstances, added to the uncommon jealousy he manifested towards the pretender, the great pains he took, and the sums which, contrary to his nature, he expended in countermining the efforts of Perkin, persuaded many people that the youth was<NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.</NOTE> not an impostor.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Be that as it may, Henry found means to win over Sir Robert Clifford to his interest. He sent Sir Edward Poynings and Sir William War∣ham as ambassadors to the archduke, to complain of the dutchess Margaret as the author of this imposture; and demand that Perkin might be delivered into his hands, as a pyrate or common enemy of mankind, who ought not to be protected by the law of nations. The council of the archduke, having de∣liberated on this demand, replied to the English ambassadors, That, in con∣sideration of the archduke's friendship for Henry, no aid should be granted to the pretender; but, that the dutchess dowager being absolute in the lands as∣signed as her dowry, he had no authority over her conduct. Philip was the more indifferent towards Henry on this occasion, as he had just concluded a treaty with Charles of France, who had delivered up his sister Margaret, with the counties of Artois and Burgundy; though he still retained some places, which he promised to restore when Philip should be of age. The ambassadors, in re∣porting the archduke's answer, gave the king to understand, that there was a collusion between that prince and the dutchess dowager, in the affair of Perkin; and Henry was so incensed at Philip's conduct, that he not only broke off all correspondence with him, but also expelled his subjects from the dominions of England. The archduke retorted this animosity upon all the English who resided in Flanders; but their resentment proceeded no farther, because they were afraid of each other.</P>

<P>Mean while the king of England was exactly informed by Sir Robert Clifford of the correspondence which the dutchess and Perkin maintained with England. In order to crush the conspiracy before it should become too dangerous, he issued orders privately for arresting John Ratcliff, lord Fitz∣walter, Sir Simon Mountford, Sir Thomas Thwaites, William Daubigney, Robert Ratcliff, Thomas Chressenor, and Thomas Ashwood, who were ap∣prehended at the same time, tried, convicted of holding treasonable correspon∣dence with Perkin, and condemned to die the death of traitors. The lord Fitzwalter was conveyed to Calais; where, in time, he might have obtained his pardon, had not his impatience of confinement prompted him to attempt his escape; in which attempt being discovered, he lost his head. Mountford, Ratcliff, and Daubigney, suffered the rigour of the law, but the rest were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardoned; and many others of the clergy, as well as of the laity, arrested on

The lord chamberlain Stanley was not yet apprehended, either because Sir Robert Clifford had no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> informed against him, or the king wanted further proof, before he should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e brought to his trial.</P>

<P>The conspiracy being thus quelled in England, Henry resolved to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He appointed his second son Henry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an infant of two years of age, vice<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy of that kingdom; and Sir Edward Poy∣nings, his deputy, with a very extensive power over the civil as well as the mili∣tary administration. At his arrival in Ireland he set on foot a severe inquiry about those who were suspected of disaffection, and in a particular manner attacked the earls of Desmond and Kildare, to whom Perkins had written, when he first landed at Cork. The first stood upon the defensive, and eluded the power of the deputy; but the earl of Kildare was sent prisoner to England, from whence he was soon dismissed to his own country, with marks of the king's esteem and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour, Henry judging that, at such a conjuncture, he should gain more by acts of clemency and indulgence, than by the exercise of rigour and severity. In this opinion he sent a commissioner to Ireland, with a formal amnesty in favour of the earl of Desmond and all the rebels of that country, resolving, if pos∣sible, by fair means, to stifle the very seeds of rebellion in an island where the house of York had such a number of partisans. While Poynings resided in Ireland he convened a parliament, which is famous on record for the acts it passed to the advantage of England, and the English settled among the Irish. One of these, still known by the name of Poynings' Act, decreed, That the parliament of Ireland could not be assembled until the governor and council should have made the king acquainted with the causes of its meeting, and received his majesty's permission, under the great seal. Another law imported,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of Irelan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> That all the statutes of England should be observed in Ireland; and these two acts are in force at this day.</P>

<P>Henry's avarice increased to such a degree of rapacity, that he em∣ployed all his invention to find out pretences for amassing sums of money; and trumped up the most frivolous accusations against wealthy individuals, that he might fill his coffers at their expence. These were the genuine effects of a covetous disposition, which was altogether in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atiable; for he had no real use for the money he thus extorted. He was at peace with all the world. He had obtained from parliament two very considerable subsidies, of which he had ex∣pended no part but what was repayed with usury. He had enriched himself with divers confiscations, and received annually <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifty thousand livres from the king of France. These resources, added to his ordinary revenues, rendered him the richest king in Europe: yet, not satisfied, he could not refrain from squeezing money out of his people by forfeitures on penal laws. The first per∣son of note who suffered in this manner was Sir William Capel, alderman of London, condemned in the sum of seven and twenty hundred pounds, sixteen hundred of which he payed to the king by way of composition; but no part of Henry's conduct redounded more to his dishonour, than his prosecution of the lord chamberlain Stanley, to whom he, in a great measure, owed his ele∣vation to the throne.</P>

<P>We have already observed that this nobleman favoured the cause of Perkin Warbeck, on the supposition that he was the real son of Edward IV. and perhaps he was influenced on this occasion by resentment against Henry, from whom he is said to have suffered a repulse, when he asked the earldom of Chester. The king certainly had reason to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>read the ill offices of such a powerful nobleman; but, in all probability, his greatest crime was his great wealth, which exceeded that of any other English subject, and captivated the heart of Henry; for the charge against him was construed into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reason, by a very high-strained interpretation. In order to accomplish his aim, he di∣rected his informer, Clifford, to come over from Flanders; and no sooner un∣derstood he was arrived in England, than he took up his residence in the Tower, that he might the more conveniently apprehend the delinquent. Clif∣ford, according to his instructions, appeared before the council; and throwing himself at the king's feet, implored his clemency, which he said he would de∣serve by declaring all that he knew of the conspiracy. Henry promised to par∣don him, on that condition; then he proceeded to impeach sundry persons, and among the rest the lord chamberlain. The king affected great surprize at this declaration, bidding him take heed; and threatening him with death, should his accusation be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound false and malicious. Clifford persisted in the charge, and the chamberlain was immediately put under arrest: next day, be∣ing examined before the council, he owned what was laid to his charge, and was condemned on his own confession; though his whole crime amounted to no more than that he had said, He would never bear arms against Perkin Warbeck, was he certain that the youth was really the son of Edward IV. Perhaps he thought himself secure in the service he had done the king, and the great credit of his brother, the earl of Derby, who had married Henry's mo∣ther.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> But he fell a sacrifice to his great wealth; and all the favour he could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>btain was the respite of a few weeks, that he might prepare himself for death, which he did not suffer till the beginning of the following year; when his post of chamberlain was filled with Giles lord Dawbeny, a nobleman of approved valour and sufficiency. The king found in Stanley's castle of Holt forty thou∣sand marks of money, and plate, besides jewels, furniture, cattle, and effects to an immense value; and an estate of three thousand pounds a year. With this boo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y he consoled himself for the secret curses of his people, who not only de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested his avarice and ingratitude, but were overwhelmed with consternation at the fate of the chamberlain, who had been condemned for that of which very few English subjects were innocent; namely, for preferring the right of the house of York to that of the reigning king. What augmented their fear was their perceiving that Henry ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntained spies to watch the conduct of the chamberlain; and, in all probability, followed the same practice with other noblemen, who d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst no longer communicate their sentiments, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t those whom they trusted as friends, should turn out informers, and betray their con∣fidence: but, what they durst not impart to their intimates, they vented in severe libels and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atires against the judges, the council, and the king him∣self; who was so provoked by those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms, that he ordered five mean<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id.</NOTE> persons, detected in dispersing the papers, to be executed as traitors.</P>

<P>In the course of this year, his favourite Richard Fox bishop of Bath and Wells was translated to the see of Durham; and the king's son Hen∣ry was created duke of York: he was at the same time made knight of the Bath, and several noblemen and persons of rank were likewise admitted into that order. Young Henry was afterwards appointed warden of the northern Marches, for defence of which the earl of Surrey began to levy forces, as the king had some reason to doubt the friendship of James IV. king of Scotland. In the summer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1495.</NOTE> king Henry, in order to convince the world, that the proceedings against Sir William Stanley had not at all diminished his regard for his brother the earl of Derby, or his affection for his own mother the wife of that nobleman, made an excursion to the earl's house at Latham, where he stayed three days, and seemed very well pleased with his entertainment. From thence he made a progress through Yorkshire; and while he was absent from the southern parts of this kingdom, Perkin Warbeck resolved to try his fortune in England. Being supplied with some troops and vessels by the dutchess of Burgundy, he set sail in July, and arriving on the co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of Kent near Sandwich, landed some of his people, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the inclinations of the natives. These endeavoured to cajole the Kentishmen, by assuring them that there was a strong armament fit∣ted out in Flanders for supporting the title of the duke of York; but, the English perceiving they were all foreigners and freebooters, instead of joining them, consulted the gentlemen of the county, who advised them to allure Per∣kins ashore with fair promises, and then make sure of his person. They ac∣cordingly took to their arms, and marching down to the sea-side, invited the pretender to land, with assurances of risking their lives in his service. But, he was dissuaded <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom trusting himself in their hands, by his secretary Frion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who from their delaying this declaration so long, and then appearing in regular bands, concluded they were part of Henry's forces. On this supposition he hindered Perkin from landing in person. The English finding he suspected their de∣sign, fell upon those whom he had sent on shore, and put them all to the sword, except about one hundred and fifty, who were brought prisoners to London, and hanged in different parts of the coast by the king's order: mean while Per∣kin, seeing the disaster of his people, hoisted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail and returned to Flanders.</P>

This statute appears at first sight to have been enacted in favour of the people; but, in reality it was calculated to hinder individuals from prying too narrowly into the king's title, which they would have no longer occasion to investigate, as this provision was made for their safety. There was another law passed for obliging<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

James, seeing no hopes of being joined by the English, and unwill∣ing to lose his labour, ravaged the county of Northumberland with fire and sword. Then Perkin, pretending to be touched with the misfortunes of the people, conjured him in public, with tears in his eyes, to spare his wretched sub∣jects; protesting he would rather live the life of a fugitive and vagabond, than be the cause of mischief to his countrymen. The Scot answered, with a sarcastic smile, that he was too generous and tender of that which did not belong to him; and that he would make an excellent steward for his adversary. James hearing that an English army was on the march to give him battle, was loth to expose the immen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e booty he had obtained, to the chance of an engagement; and therefore retired with expedition into his own country. Henry was not a little disgusted at this expedition, though it had not been attended with any important consequence. He knew his subjects were generally disaffected; that the Irish were strongly attached to the house of York; and that Perkin was still at hand, to profit by the first favourable opportunity that might occur. In order to secure himself on all hands, he granted a general amnesty to all the Irish who had declared for the pretender, that they might not be induced to rebel again by the fear of punishment. He employed Richard Fox bishop of Durham, to enter into a negotiation with James, as of his own accord, and treat of a mar∣riage between that prince and his eldest daughter Margaret: he had already en∣gaged in the league of Italy against Charles VIII. of France; and now he sent ambassadors to Ferdinand and Isabella, to confirm the former alliance, and re∣new the engagements for the marriage between his son Arthur prince of Wales and their third daughter Catherine.</P>

<P>With respect to Scotland, notwithstanding the plan he had formed for a pacification with that kingdom, he would not let slip any opportunity of de∣manding a subsidy from parliament, which he therefore convoked in the month<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> of January. In a speech to both houses, he expatiated upon the insult he had received from the king of Scotland; drew a pathetic picture of the miseries which the people of the north had undergone, in the time of a truce, when they had no reason to expect such hostilities; and declared, that the honour of his crown, and the duty he owed to his subjects, would not permit him to bear such an indignity, without taking signal vengeance on the invader. The parlia∣ment understood the hint, and voted a subsidy of one hundred and twenty thou∣sand pounds, besides two fifteenths; which were no sooner granted than the as∣sembly was dismissed. He did not at all doubt that his negotiation with Scot∣land would succeed; and therefore, that he might have the subsidy in his coffers before the peace should be concluded, he ordered his commissioners to levy it with all possible dispatch. These collectors met with unexpected opposition in the county of Cornwal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the inhabitants of which loudly complained that they should be saddled with such a grievous imposition, on account of some damage which had been done at the other end of the kingdom. These murmurs were
<PB N="507" REF="5170"/>
encouraged by one Michael Joseph, a popular and factious blacksmith of Bod∣min, and Thomas Flammock, a lawyer of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very turbulent disposition, who assured the common people, that the fiefs depending upon the crown were the proper funds assigned for the maintenance of war; that the possessors of those fiefs held them on condition of defending the frontiers; that the king ought to apply to them, in case of an invasion from Scotland, and not pillage the king∣dom, under the sanction of parliament. He said it would be shameful to submit to such imposition, which was the work of evil ministers, that made their court to the king at the expence of the poor people; that they ought to take arms in their own defence; without injury to any person whatsoever, go and pre∣sent a petition to his majesty, intreating him to ease them of such a burthen∣some tax, and punish his pernicious counsellors, the chief of whom were arch∣bishop Morton and Sir Reginald Bray, the two ministers whom he consulted in all his money transactions. The populace being thus inflamed, the Lawyer and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> the Blacksmith offered to conduct them, until they should be headed by some person of quality, which he assured them would be the case; and they forthwith armed themselves with such weapons as they could procure. Under the di∣rection of those two incendiaries, they marched through the counties of Devon and Somerset, their numbers continually increasing in their route. At Taun∣ton they murdered a collector, who had been very rigorous in the execution of his office; and this was the only act of violence they committed. At Wells they were joined by the lord Audeley, an unquiet and ambitious nobleman, who, being chosen their general, conducted them to Salisbury and Winchester, without allowing them to do the least injury to the places through which they passed. Instead of marching directly to London, according to their original design, they turned off towards Kent, in hope of being joined by the people of that county, who were said to be very zealous for the liberty of the subject: but they were disappointed in their expectation. The noblemen and freeholders of Kent had taken such precautions to prevent an insurrection, that the Cornish∣men were not joined by one person in the county: a circumstance which dis∣couraged a great number of the insurgents to such a degree, that they retired to their own habitations. The rest, however, animated by the backwardness of the king, who had made no attempt to stop their progress, continued their march, boasting that they would either give him battle, or take London, under his eye; and with this resolution they proceeded as far as Blackheath, encamp∣ing between El<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ham and Greenwich.</P>

<P>When the king first heard of this insurrection, he had already raised an army for the Scottish war, and given the command of it to the lord cham∣berlain Daubeney; but now he resolved to keep the best part of the troops in the southern part of the kingdom, and sent the earl of Surrey with a detach∣ment to guard the northern frontiers. Understanding that the rebels did not waste the country in their march, he continued inactive, that he migh judge of the disaffection that prevailed in the counties through which they passed, by the number that would join them in their route: he was not without hope that they would disperse of themselves, tired of the length and hardships of their march; and, should they proceed to the neighbourhood of London, he foresaw that they would be more easily and effectually crushed, at such a distance from their own country, than they could have been in the western parrs of England<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="508" REF="5180"/>
The citizens of London were overwhelmed with consternation at their approach, until they saw the king exert himself in earnest for their defence, and even place himself between them and the danger. He no sooner understood that they had encamped at Blackheath, than he divided his army into three bodies, one of which, commanded by the earl of Oxford, marched round the hill, in order to cut off their retreat, and attack them in the rear, should it be found ne∣cessary to pract<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e that expedient. The second, under the conduct of the lord Daube<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey, was destined to charge them in front; and Henry himself, with the third division, encamped in St. George's Fields, with a view to reinforce the others occasionally, or throw himself into London, in case of mischance. These dispositions being made, he declared that he would give the rebels battle on Monday, though his intention was to engage them on Saturday, which he deemed fortunate in all his enterprizes. By this feint he hoped to find them unprepared; and it succeeded according to his wish. On the twenty-second day of June, towards the close of the day, the lord Daubeney marched towards them, in order of battle. Having defeated an advanced guard at Deptford∣Bridge, where they made a vigorous stand, he ascended the hill, and sound them pretty far in the heath, drawing up in battalia, not without manifest con∣fusion; for they did not expect to be attacked till Monday, and in that notion suffered themselves to be surprized. Nevertheless, they fought with uncom∣mon courage, though in a tumultuary manner, and killed above three hundred of the king's soldiers, with arrows of a very uncommon length. The lord Dau∣beney attacked them with such fury and precipitation, that he was taken pri∣soner in the beginning of the action, but immediately rescued by the valour of his men, who charged with irresistible fury, and the rebels were routed with great slaughter; for when they attempted to fly, they found themselves inter∣cepted by the earl of Oxford's division. The lord Audeley, Flammock, and the Blacksmith, were taken; and of sixteen thousand, to which their number amounted, two thousand fell in the field of battle: as for the rest, they sub∣mitted to the king's pleasure. Audeley was beheaded on Tower-Hill; Flam∣mock and the Blacksmith suffered at Tyburn, the latter expressing great satisfac∣tion, that his name should be famous in after-times; and all the rest were par∣doned by proclamation.</P>

<P>While Henry was employed in quelling this rebellion, the king of Scotland, judging this a favourable opportunity, made a second irruption into England, and invested the castle of Norham; but the earl of Surrey marching to its relief, he retired to his own country, whither he was pursued by the English general, who took the castle of Ayton, situated between Berwick and Edinburgh. The king of England desired nothing more than a peace with James, by which he would not only be freed from his apprehension of Perkin Warbeck, but also be enabled to save the subsidy in his own coffers: but he was afraid to make the first overtures, lest he should meet with a repulse. In reflecting upon this subject, he bethought himself of a fit agent for nego∣tiating a peace between the two nations, without his suffering in point of ho∣nour. This was Don Pedro D'Ayala the Spanish ambassador, sent by Ferdinand and Isabella to conclude the contract of marriage between the prince of Wales<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> and the infanta Catherine. This envoy, who enjoyed a great share of Henry's confidence, undertook to visit the king of Scotland, and as from himself pro∣pose
<PB N="509" REF="5190"/>
an accommodation. He accordingly set out for Edinburgh, and executed his commission, on pretence that nothing would afford more pleasure to his master the king of Spain, than to see two monarchs, who were his friends and allies, live in good understanding with each other. He found the Scottish king<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> so well disposed to a treaty, that he wrote to Henry, assuring him of success; and a congress was immediately opened at Ay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, under the mediation of this ambassador. The greatest difficulty that occurred was on the subject of Perkin Warbeck, whose person Henry demanded, and whom James positively refused to deliver. The bishop of Durham proposed an interview between the two kings at Newcastle; but the Scot rejected this proposal, observing, that how desirous soever he might be of peace, he would not go and beg it in his enemy's country. At length both sides agreed that James should honourably dismiss the pretended duke of York, and afterwards proceed with the negotiation, as if Perkin had never been in Scotland. In pursuance of this convention, that mo∣narch told this adventurer, that he had done every thing in his power to support him in his pretensions; that he had twice entered England at the head of an army; but that, as the English had refused to espouse his cause, he could not expect that the Scots would, without their concurrence, be able to establish him on the throne of England. He therefore advised him to form some more feasible plan, and chuse some other country for the place of his residence: at the same time he assured him, that he would punctually fulfil his promise, that he should not repent of having put himself into his hands; for he should be honourably accommodated with ships and necessaries for his voyage. Perkin<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir J. Ware.</NOTE> bore his misfortune with a good grace; thanked the king of Scotland for the protection and other favours he had enjoyed from his bounty; and desired that he and his wife might be conveyed to Ireland. James complied with his re∣quest; and he arrived at Cork, where he still found friends and adherents. He had no sooner quitted Scotland, than the ambassadors at Ayton signed a treaty of truce for seven years, importing, That the two kings should no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make war upon each other by themselves, their subjects, or any other person whatsoever: That certain points about which the ambassadors could not agree, should be referred to the arbitration of Ferdinand and Isabella: And that the truce should be prolonged till one year after the death of that party, who should die before the other. But at this treaty no mention was made of the marriage between James and Henry's daughter, which afterwards took effect, and gave birth to the union of the two kingdoms. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

When they returned to their own country, they pub∣licly proclaimed, that the gentleness with which they had been treated was not owing to the king's mercy, but his apprehension of his own subjects, three fourths of whom were of the same sentiments which they professed. These in∣sinuations persuading their friends and neighbours that the whole kingdom was ready to take arms against Henry, they began to assemble in companies, and concert measures for making another attempt against the government. Some of the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t zealous among them, under<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tanding that Perkin Warbeck was in Ireland, proposed that he should be invited over, and chosen general of their intended expedition. They accordingly sent a deputation to tell him, that if he would repair to Cornwal he would find considerable succours, which, with the assistance of his other friends, would, in all probability, establish him on the throne of England. Perkin, finding himself without resource, and abandoned by all those foreign powers who had formerly countenanced his projects, ac∣cepted the invitation, by the advice of his three chief counsellors, namely, a bankrupt mercer called Herne, one Skelton a taylor, and a scrivener of the name of Astley. He forthwith embarked with about seventy men in four small vessels, and, arriving at Whitsand-Bay, in September, repaired to Bodmin, where the former insurrection had begun. There being joined with about three thousand men, he published a proclamation, in which he assumed the title of Richard IV. king of England, inveighed bitterly against Henry Tudor; and e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>horted the people, with promise of extraordinary rewards, to take arms, in or∣der to depose the usurper.

This friar, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad been used as a tool by the king's

This was the prelude to the fate of Perkin and the earl of Warwick, whose pretended plot being now discovered, Perkin was tried at Westminster, and being convicted on the evi∣dence of the lord Digby's servants, was hanged at Tyburn, with John Walter mayor of Cork, who had constanly adhered to his cause, in all the vici<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itudes of his fortune.

In a few days after Perkin's execution, Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale.</NOTE> earl of Warwick was tried by his peers before John earl of Oxford, created high steward on that occasion; and being convicted of high treason, in con∣sequence of pleading guilty to the arraignment, was beheaded on Tower-Hill.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> The deplorable end of this innocent nobleman, the last male-branch of the Plantagenets, and the fate of Perkin Warbeck, who, notwithstanding all that appeared against him, was by the unprejudiced part of the nation deemed the real son of king Edward, filled the whole kingdom with such horror and aver∣sion to the government of Henry, that he was fain to translate the odium upon his ally Ferdinand, by divulging that prince's scruples, for the removal of which he had been obliged to deliver the competitors for his crown into the hands of justice.</P>

<P>About this period, the peace of Estaples between France and Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Lewis was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the more inclined to live on good terms with England, as he had formed the design to make himself master of Milan, by means of a league with the Vene∣tians. He accordingly joined these confederates, and attacked Ludovico Sforz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, sovereign of that dutchy, who was obliged to fly for refuge to the em∣peror, after having lost all his dominions. But the castle of Milan, and Genoa, of which he had been in possession, voluntarily submitted to Lewis. Pope Alexander VI. having published a jubilee for the beginning of the century, permitted those Christians who lived at a great distance from Rome, to pur∣chase the privilege of the festival, without being obliged to visit the churches of that city. In order to collect the sums ari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing from this indulgence, he sent agents into all the states of Christendom; and employed a Spaniard called Gas∣par Pons, for that purpose in England, where he raised a large contribution. This nuncio was directed to inform the king, that his holiness had resolved to publish a crusade against the Turks, and even to go in person with the English monarch, the Venetians, and the princes of Italy, to attack Constantinople by sea, while the other powers of Europe should fall upon them in Thrace, Greece, and different parts of the continent. Henry plainly perceived that Alexander's drift was to amass money by contributions for this expedition; but, he dis∣sembled his opinion, expressed the utmost zeal for the success of the enter∣prize; offered to furnish a large proportion of men and money; to serve under his holiness in person; and demanded, that some strong places on the coast of Italy might be put into his hands, to serve as a retreat, in case of necessity. He even appointed ambassadors to go and treat with the pontiff on this subject; and made such a parade of his zeal for the interest of religion, that the knig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> England being grievously afflicted with the plague, Henry, after having several times changed the place of his residence, retired with his queen and family to Calais, where he received an embassy from the archduke Philip, desiring a friendly interview; and the king agreed to meet him in the church of St. Peter, which stands without the gates of Calais, as the archduke expressed a reluctance to enter a fortified city. At the time fixed for their meeting, Henry being informed of his approach, rode out to receive him on horseback, and Philip alighting, ran up to hold his stirrup; but Henry would not admit of such humiliation, and they embraced each other with marks of the most cordial af∣fection. Then they entered the church, where they had a long conference, in which the archduke expressed a most eager desire to live in friendship with the English monarch, whom he addressed with the appellation of his good patron, father, and protector. During Henry's residence at Calais, he was also visited by the governor of Picardy, and bailiff of Amiens, sent by the French king, to congratulate him upon his coming to the continent; and notify his conquest of Milan. That prince, in order to testify his good will to the king of England, had sollicited and obtained a bull from the pope, declaring him excommunicated, should he ever fail in the yearly payments to Henry, stipu∣lated in the treaty of Estaples. The pope, at the same time, granted a dispen∣sation for the marriage of James king of Scotland, with the princess Margaret, tho', on account of her tender years, the consummation was postponed.</P>

<P>Henry being now at peace with all Europe, and his dominions enjoying the most profound repose, the avarice of his disposition had leisure to exert itself, and his desire of amassing became every day more and more rapa∣cious. As he had no longer any pretence for demanding subsidies from parlia∣ment, he resolved to drain the party of Warbeck, until they should be quite exhausted. On the supposition, that the adherents of this pretender were still subject to the rigour of the laws, he insisted upon their being indulged with separate pardons, which they did not at all sollicit; and compelled them to pay largely for this indulgence. He appointed commissioners to set on foot a new inquiry about those who had in any manner asserted or favoured the revolt of the Blacksmith, and that of Perkin Warbeck. These inquisitors were im∣powered to amerce at discretion every individual who should have the benefit of the pardon; and even to seize the effects of the deceased, should their heirs refuse to make a composition. Such oppression augmented the popular cla∣mour against Henry, and was in a great measure attributed to the counsels of cardinal Morton archbishop of Canterbury, who died at this period, very little regretted by the English. He was succeeded in his metropolitan see by Henry Dean bishop of Salisbury; and now the nation perceived, that Henry's avarice and extortion were not the effects of Morton's advice, but qualities inherent in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r.</NOTE> his own constitution. Never was king of England more hated by his subjects, though this hatred was mingled with fear, produced by his uninterrupted success, and the opinion of his great ability both as a monarch and a politician. All

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="63" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LXIII.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding this felicity, he was not a little disturbed by an accident which at this juncture encroached upon his repose. The earl of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1501.</NOTE> Suffolk, nephew to king Edward IV. and brother to the earl of Lincoln, who had fallen in the battle of Stoke, chanced to kill a man, in his passion; and, though he was a branch of the house of York, the king consented to indulge him with a pardon; but, in order to leave a stigma upon his character, he ob∣liged him to appear personally, and plead his pardon in public. The earl being of an haughty disposition, resented this disgrace so deeply, that he retired in disgust to his aunt Margaret dutchess dowager of Flanders; and Henry was not a little startled at his retreat. In order to anticipate any designs he might<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> hatch to his prejudice, he sent over emissaries, who by dint of promises and profes∣sions, persuaded him to return and be reconciled to the government. Henry's throne being now so firmly established, that there was hardly a possibility to shake it, Ferdinand king of Arragon, parted with his daughter Catherine, who arriv∣ing in England in the month of October, was married to Arthur prince of Wales, and the nuptials were celebrated at London, with great pomp and solemnity, on the fourteenth day of November, the prince being then turned of fifteen, and the lady about the age of eighteen. Her dower amounted to two hundred thousand ducats in money, jewels and plate; and a third part of the principality of Wales, dukedom of Cornwal, and earldom of Chester, was assigned to her as a jointure, provided her husband should die before his accession to the throne.</P>

<DIV4 N="64" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LXIV.</HEAD>
<P>This match was succeeded by the contract of another marriage, be∣tween<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the king of Scotland, and Henry's daughter Margaret, on whom her father bestowed a portion of thirty thousand crowns. The marriage-treaty was rati∣fied by the Scottish ambassadors at London, on the twenty-fourth day of Janu∣ary;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

When this affair was debated in council, an English nobleman observed, that if Henry should survive his male-issue, the crown would devolve to the king of Scotland; to which insinu∣ation Henry replied, that in such a case Scotland would become an accession to England, as the smaller would always be swallowed up in the greater dominion. On this occasion a treaty of perpetual peace between the two nations was sign∣ed and confirmed, together with certain articles for preventing incursions on either side; but, the consummation of marriage was, on account of the tender years of the princess, postponed till the following year, when the king accom∣pained her on her way as far as Colli-Weston, where he consigned her and her attendants to the care of the earl of Northumberland, who, with a considerable retinue of noblemen and ladies, conveyed her to the king her husband at Edinburgh. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE></P>

<P>The joy produced by this marriage was soon damped by the death of Arthur prince of Wales, who did not survive his nuptials above five months. He died at Ludlow-Castle, universally regretted by the English nation, who had conceived happy omens from his promising talents; and, in about three months after his decease, his brother Henry was, in the twelfth year of his

During the course of this year the emperor Maximilian sent an embassy to England, to propose a league against the Turks, and to borrow money of Henry, who chose rather to present him with ten thousand pounds sterling, as a free gift for that purpose, than to en∣gage in the league, or begin a traffic of lending money to such a beggarly potentate.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 15<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.</NOTE> About the beginning of February, Henry's Queen Elizabeth died in childbed, very little lamented by her husband, from whom she had never received any marks of tenderness or affection. He even rejoiced at her death, as an event that freed him from a hateful rival in his title to the throne. He was now raised to the very summit of prosperity. He lived in peace with all his neighbours, and all domestic troubles had ceased. But, he was resolved that his subjects should not share in his felicity; for, his avarice becoming every day more and more insatiable, he employed all his invention in devising new me∣thods of extortion. For these sordid purposes he retained two infamous mi∣nisters called Empson and Dudley, who followed the profession of the law, and practised all its subterfuges and chicanery, in oppressing the subjects with false accusations and imprisonment, until they were fain to purchase what was called a mitigation, with the best part of their s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bstance. Such was their insolence, that they did not even observe the common forms of justice; but, proceeded with the most arbitrary licence, to attack pretended delinquents, and try them in private, without fair examination o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> verdict of jury: and these acts of violence they ex∣ercised under the authority of the king, who shared the fruits of their oppres∣sion. He even insisted upon their keeping regular accompts of this scandalous commerce, and maintained a kind of distributive justice, even in the practice of corruption—. He let slip no occasion for amassing money, howsoever mean or ungrateful it might be. One day, while he was magnificently entertained by the earl of Oxford, to whose services he was in great measure indebted for the crown he enjoyed, he perceived a greater number of domestics in livery than the law allowed him to maintain; and turning to the earl, <Q>“My lord (said he) I have heard much of your hospitality; but, it exceeds report. Are all these gentlemen and yeomen your menial servants?”</Q> Oxford answering, that they were retained upon such extraordinary occasions only: Henry affected surprize, and replied with some warmth, <Q>“By my faith! my lord, I thank you for my good chear; but, I may not endure to have my laws broken in my sight. My attorney must speak with you.”</Q> The earl was afterwards <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We are informed by lord Verulam, that he had seen a book of such accompts, kept by Emp∣son, and subscribed in almost every leaf by the king's own hand; among other articles, he found the following.

<P>Such conduct in the king and his ministers could not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail to render them extremely odious to the people, who murmured incessantly against the government; and this discontent encouraged the earl of Suffolk, whose for∣tune was by this time greatly reduced by his own extravagance, to form new projects against the person and government of Henry. He had acquired a degree of popularity as the surviving branch of the house of York: he privately engaged some persons of consideration in his interest; and then retired to Flanders, in hope of receiving countenance and succour from the old dutchess of Burgundy. The king<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> alarmed at his retreat, and eager to know his scheme, with the names of his as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ociates, repeated the expedient he had used in the case of Perkin War∣beck. Sir Robert Curson, govern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of the castle of H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmes, being properly instructed, abandoned his charge, on pretence of having been injured by the king; and retiring to Flanders, off<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red his service to the earl of Suffolk. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acted his part with such dexterity, that in a little time he ins<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nuated himself into the confidence of that nobleman; and soon discovered all his associates. The in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elligence was forthwith conveyed to Henry, who immediately issued warrants for arresting his own brother-in-law William Courtney earl of Devon∣shire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> husband to the princess Catherine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> daughter o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Edward IV. William De la Pole brother to the earl of Suffolk, Sir James Tyrrel, and Sir John Wyndham; George lord Abergavenny, and Sir Thomas Green, were appre∣hended at the same time, upon slight suspicion, but soon discharged. The earl of Devonshire, and De la Pole, tho' nothing material appeared against them, were detained prisoners during the king's life. Tyrrel, who had been con∣cerned in the death of Edward V. was beheaded together with Wyndham; and several others of inferior note were executed as traitors. Henry, willing to be still better informed, touching the particular designs of the earl of Suffolk, took a very extraordinary method to maintain Curson in the confidence of that nobleman. He published in St. Paul's church, the bull of pope Innocent VIII. denouncing the censures of the church against all those who should disturb his government; and caused the earl of Suffolk and Sir Robert Curson to be ex∣communicated by name. When this emi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sary had discovered all the earl's se∣crets, he r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>turned to England; and was readmitted into the king's favour, which, however, he did not enjoy without the curses of the people, who abhor∣red his perfidy.

<P>Henry, being unwilling to refund one half of Catherine's dower, which he had already received, and extremely eager to touch the other moiety, proposed to Ferdin and that the young widow should be married to Henry prince of Wales, brother to her late husband; and the proposal was embraced by the lady's parents, provided the pope's dispensation could be procured. In the convention settled between the two courts on this subject, one reason, alledged for demanding the dispensation, was, that the marriage between Arthur and Ca∣therine had been formally solemnized and consummated; and pope Pius IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>On the sixteenth day of January the king assembled a parliament, on pretence of enacting new law<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but in effect to demand a subsidy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the por∣tion of his eldest daughter, which he accordingly received to a much greater val<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e than that he payed to the king of Scotland; so that he was every way a gainer by the marriage. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at he was now quite absolute in his dominions, appears from the condescension of the commons, who chose for their speaker that very Dudley whom the whole nation detested as the instrument by which they were so grievously oppressed. This complaisant parliament desired him to accept of forty thousand pounds, in lieu of aids, for knighting his eldest son Arthur, and the marriage of his daughter Margaret; and he, in token of his moderation and regard to his subjects, remitted one fourth of that sum, the rest being levied on the cities, boroughs, towns, and landholders of the kingdom. He likewise filled his coffers by an act of parliament passed in this session, at∣tainting a great number of persons who had been concerned in the insurrections from the very beginning of his reign; as well as by another, disannulling all patents and grants enjoyed by those who either refused to appear, when sum∣mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, in the king's defence against enemies and rebels, or retired from that service without licence. The patents of goals were likewise resumed and re∣annexed to the sheriffwicks; foreign manufactures of silk were prohibited; a law was enacted against the currency of diminished silver pieces, which under∣went a recoinage: and several regulations were made for the maintenance of ci∣vil policy. Notwithstanding these sources of wealth, Henry, before the expi∣ration of the year, issued commissions for a general benevolence, though he could not assign the least shadow of a reason for this imposition; and the city of London was fain to pay five thousand marks for the confirmation of its liber∣ties. Not satisfied with the payment of the second moiety of Catherine's por∣tion, the subsidy granted by parliament, the confiscation of estates, the profits of a recoinage, the benevolence, and redemption of the city's liberties, he still continued to grind the face of the subjects by means of Empson and Dudley, who ama<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed great fortunes, as the tools of his rapacity.</P>

<P>In order to make some sort of atonement for these extortions, and do something that might recommend him to the house of Lancaster, he or∣dered the body of king Henry VI<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be removed from Windsor <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Westminster, where it was interred <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith great pomp; and applied to the pope for a bull to canonize that monarch: b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the miracles, attributed to that prince after his death, were so ill asserted, that his ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ness would not admit him to a place among the saints, without such a consideration as Henry did not think proper to afford; and therefore the design was laid aside. Isabel, queen of Castile, dying in November, her husband Ferdinand immediately notified her decease to Henry, giving him to understand, that she had appointed him (Ferdinand) administrator of the kingdom of Castile, for their daughter Joan, married to Philip archduke of Austria. This prince, being engaged in a war with the duke of G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elderland, could not immediately repair to Spain to take possession of this inheritance, and therefore connived, for the present, at the administration of his father-in-law; resolving, however, to deprive him of it with the first op∣portunity.
<PB N="519" REF="5290"/>
On the other hand, Ferdinand, by virtue of Isabel's la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t will, pre∣tended to enjoy the administration till his dying day. This was a very inte∣resting difference to Henry, who resembled Ferdinand not only in his dispo∣sition, but even in the nature of his situation. He knew the majority of his subjects looked upon his late consort Elizabeth as the rightful queen of Eng∣land; and that her right had now, of consequence, devolved to the prince of Wales, her son and lawful successor. He, therefore, considered the termination of the difference between Ferdinand and Philip, as a precedent for or against his own title. He was afraid that Philip would engage in a league with Lewis XII. and the emperor, in order to expel his father-in-law from Castile, in which case he should be obliged to support his ally against three powerful adversaries. He foresaw that such contention would involve him in new dangers, and drain his coffers which he had been at such pains to fill, and in the contemplation of which he placed his chief happiness. This was the goal to which all his endea∣vours<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1505.</NOTE> tended. He formed the design of espousing the widow of Ferdinand king of Naples, that he might enjoy the great dower which had been assigned to her in that kingdom: and perhaps he thought, that, in consequence of this match, he might be chosen arbiter of the difference subsisting between the kings of France and Arragon, touching the territories of Naples. That kingdom had been conquered and divided between them, though this partition was at∣tended by a quarrel, which produced two battles, and these proved fatal to the French interest in Italy.</P>

<P>Henry was so eager to know the disposition of the Castilians to∣wards Ferdinand, and the particulars relating to the personal qualities and cir∣cumstances of the queen of Naples, that he sent three persons in whom he could confide; namely, Francis Marsen, James Braybrook, and John Stile, to obtain intelligence on the spot. They set out on pretence of travelling for pleasure; but they were furnished with letters of compliment from Catherine princess of Wales to her aunt and niece the two dowagers of Naples; and they were instructed to send home an exact description of the complexion, features, stature, age, health, customs, deportment, and disposition of the younger queen; together with a circumstantial account of the dower she enjoyed. Howsoever<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hollingshed.</NOTE> he might have relished the qualifications of her person, he dropped his matri∣monial scheme, when he understood that although the settlement of that prin∣cess was very considerable, as established by the marriage-contract, yet she had been reduced to an uncertain pension since Ferdinand had subdued the king∣dom. The intelligence which Henry's agents sent from Castile, was not much more agreeable. Ferdinand still continued in the post of administrator, which he hoped to maintain for life, partly by his influence with Philip's coun∣sellors, some of whom he had gained over to his interest; and partly by threatening that, in case the archduke should prove refractory, he would take another wife, and beget an heir to the kingdom of Arragon: but, at the same time, the nobles and people of Spain were better affected to Philip in right of his wife than to Ferdinand, who had loaded them with burthensome impo∣sitions. Henry's secret envoys gave him to understand, that there was actually a project of marriage between Ferdinand and madam de Foix, which would certainly take place should Philip attempt to thwart his father-in-law.

In the channel they were overtaken by a violent storm that dispersed their ships, and the vessel that carried Philip and his confort was driven into the harbour of Weymouth in Dor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etshire. The country people, alarmed at the appearance of such a numerous navy, took to their arms. Sir Thomas Trenchard, advancing at the head of some troops, no sooner learned that the king and queen of Castile were landed, than he went to offer his re∣spects to there in person, and begged they would do him the honour to lodge at his house, until the king should be informed of their arrival. Philip, per∣ceiving that there was no possibility of re-imbarking immediately, accepted this invitation with a good grace. Henry, being apprised of their landing, sent the earl of Arundel to compliment them in his name, to assure them that he would, with all possible dispatch, have the pleasure of embracing them; and in the mean time that they might command in his dominions. Philip, in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orten the visit, set out immediately for the court at Windsor, where he and his confort were received with all the marks of the most cordial friend∣ship: though Henry was resolved to derive some advantage from the accident that brought them into his dominions. He proposed that as Philip had changed his condition, in becoming king of Castile, the treaty of commerce between England and the Low Countries should be renewed. That prince com∣prehending perfectly well the delicate nature of his present situation, did not think proper to make any objections to this proposal, and the treaty was re∣newed, with some alteration in favour of the English; among other things they suppressed that article of the former treaty by which Philip's subjects were permitted to fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h on the coast of England.

<P>This affair being finished, Henry proposed a marriage between himself and Philip's sister Margaret, widow of the duke of Savoy; and the king of Castile, being well pleased with the prospect of such an alliance, the marriage-contract was immediately settled; Philip engaging to pay three hun∣dred thousand crowns, in lieu of a dower to his sister, together with an annuity of three thousand eight hundred and fifty. Henry, not yet satisfied with these concessions, seemed altogether determined to detain his guest until he should de∣liver up the earl of Suffolk, from whose machinations he still dreaded some trou∣ble and disquiet. He therefore took an opportunity of being alone with Phi∣lip, to say with some emotion, <Q>“Sir, you have been saved upon my coast; I hope you will not suffer me to be wrecked upon yours.”</Q> When the king of
<PB N="521" REF="5310"/>
Castile desired to know the meaning of that address, <Q>“I mean (replied Henry) that same hair-brained, wild fellow, my subject, the earl of Suffolk, who is protected in your country, and begins to play the fool, when others are tired of the game.”</Q> To this explanation Philip answered, <Q>“I thought your felicity had raised you above all such apprehensions; but, since you are un∣easy at his residing in Flanders, I will banish him from my dominions.”</Q> The English monarch expressing a desire of having him in his power, Philip told him in some confusion, That he could not deliver him up with any regard to his own honour: and that such a step would be still less for the reputation of Henry, as the world would imagine he had treated his guest as a prisoner. <Q>“I will take that disgrace upon myself (said the king) and so your honour will be saved.”</Q> The other, seeing he would not be denied, composed his countenance; saying, <Q>“Sir, you give law to me, and I will dictate to you in my turn; Suffolk shall be delivered up; but you will give me your honour that his life shall be safe.”</Q> Henry agreeing to this proposal, he wrote a let∣ter<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> to the earl of Suffolk, assuring him that he had obtained his pardon; and the king confirming this assertion by another message, that nobleman returned to his own country, and was immediately committed close prisoner to the Tower. But the king had resolved that his royal guests should not quit his dominions until the earl's arrival; and, in order to disguise the restraint, he entertained them with feasting and pastimes: through which, however, Philip easily perceived his intention, and therefore expressed no desire of departing, un∣til the earl was actually secured. Then he was allowed to prosecute his voyage, after having been detained three months in England, during which he was in∣stalled in the order of the garter, and conferred that of the golden fleece on Henry prince of Wales.</P>

<P>On his arrival at Castile, he and his consort were so much ca∣ressed by the Spaniards, that Ferdinand did not think proper to insist upon the administration, but retired to his own kingdom of Arragon. Philip dying in a few months after he took possession, his queen was so overwhelmed with grief, that she lost her reason; and the government of Castile reverted to her father Ferdinand, who is said to have used no endeavour for her cure, lest he should have been sent back to Arragon. Mean while her infant son, Charles, was left to the guardianship of Lewis king of France, who discharged the of∣fice with uncommon fidelity, in appointing the lord of Chevres for his gover∣nor. But the disinterested conduct of the French king was not of long du∣ration; for he not only renounced his engagement with respect to his eldest daughter Claude, who was betrothed to Charles, but likewise spirited up the duke of Guelderland to recommence hostilities in Flanders, left a league should be formed against him by the emperor, the archduke, and Ferdinand. The Flemings intreated Maximilian to come into their country, and take the reins of government into his own hands, during the minority of his grandchild Charles. The emperor promised to comply with their request. In the mean time, he sent thither his daughter Margaret, widow of the duke of Savoy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> in quality of gouvernante of the Low Countries: and that princess concluded a provisional treaty of commerce with Henry, which was ratified at Calais.</P>

Henry was tall, streight, and well-shaped, though slen∣der; of a grave aspect, and saturnine complexion; austere in address, and reserved in conversation, except when he had a favourite point to carry; and then he could fawn, flatter, and practise all the arts of insinuation. He inhe∣rited a natural fund of sagacity, which was improved by study and experi∣ence; nor was he deficient in personal bravery, or political courage. He was cool, close, cunning, dark, distrustful, and designing; and, of all the princes who had sat upon the English throne, the most fordid, selfish, and ignoble. He possessed in a peculiar manner the art of turning all his domestic troubles, and all his foreign disputes, to his own advantage: hence he acquired the ap∣pellation of the English Solomon; and all the powers of the continent courted his alliance on account of his wealth, wisdom, and uninterrupted prosperity. The nobility he excluded entirely from the administration of public affairs, and employed clergymen and lawyers, who, as they had no interest in the nation, and depended intirely upon his favour, were more obsequious to his will, and ready to concur in all his arbitrary measures. At the same time it must be owned he was a wise legislator, chaste, temperate, assiduous in the exercise of religious duties; decent in his deportment, and exact in the administration of justice, when his own private interest was not concerned; though he fre∣quently used religion and justice as cloaks for perfidy and oppression. His soul was continually actuated by two ruling passions, equally base and unkingly; namely, the fear of losing his crown, and the desire of amassing riches; and these motives influenced his whole conduct. Nevertheless, his apprehension and avarice redounded on the whole to the advantage of the nation. The first induced him to depress the nobility, and abolish the feudal tenures, which rendered them equally formidable to the prince and the people; and his ava∣rice prompted him to encourage industry and trade, because it improved his customs, and enriched his subjects, whom he could afterwards pillage at discretion.</P>

<P>HENRY VIII. the sole surviving son of the late king, ascended the throne in the eighteenth year of his age, with all the advantages that such a young prince could enjoy. His kingdom was free from all dome∣stic troubles; his neighbours courted his friendship; his coffers were full of money; and he succeeded a prince, whose avarice served as a foil to his libera∣lity: so that his accession to the throne could not but be agreeable to the Eng∣lish nation. His father, with a view to detach him from the consideration of state-affairs, had engaged him in the study of school-learning, and he made considerable progress in the languages, theology, and the philosophy of Aristo∣tle. The consciousness of this learning, added to the impetuosity of a passio∣nate temper, and the contemplation of his own personal accomplishments, which were really extraordinary, inspired him with such a share of self-conceit as laid him open to the penetration and artifice of other potentates. He was frank, open, and ostentatious. His father was not more penurious than he was prodigal; and what was still more remarkable; the earl of Surry, who had e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣joyed the post of lord high treasurer in the former reign, on account of his re∣sembling the king in parsimony and backwardness to part with money, still maintained his place, by his conformity to the expensive disposition of young Henry; so that he seemed to change his nature with his sovereign.</P>

<P>While preparations were making for the funeral of the deceased king, who was interred with incredible magnificence, the new mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rch retired to the Tower, in order to consult his father's ministers, about the measures neces∣sary to be taken in the beginning of his reign. The lord Stafford, brother to the duke of Buckingham, was arrested upon some false information; but soon released, and created earl of Wiltshire. The bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic of Durham being vacant, by the translation of Christopher B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbridge to the see of York, the king be∣stowed it on Thom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Ruth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l doctor of law, and member of the privy council. He likewise confirmed an amnesty in favour of his subjects, which his father <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad granted on his death-bed: tho' this did not extend to all delinquents; for, he soon published a proclamation, inviting his people to prefer complaints against those who had oppressed them, on pretence of maintaining the prerogative; and immediately an infinite number of petitions was presented against Empson and Dudley, who being examined before the council, were committed to the Tow∣er, as victims devoted to destruction. As they had shel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emselves in such a manner, under the shadow of the law, that they could not be condemned for their exactions, they were tried on a frivolous accusation, of a design to rebel against the reigning prince; and received sentence of death for a crime of which they were intirely innocent.

<P>The next affair that employed the king's attention, was his marriage with his brother's widow, which he had not yet consummated. Notwithstand∣ing the pope's dispensation, young Henry, at the desire of his father, who had in all probability laid some scheme for deceiving Ferdinand, no sooner attained to the fourteenth year of his age, than he protested in a formal manner against the consent he had given to this match; tho' this protestation was kept so secret, that it never came to light until it was thought necessary that the public should be made acquainted with the transaction. Ferdinand, as soon as he was in∣formed of old Henry's death, invested the count de Fuensalida, his ambassador in England, with full power to renew the treaty of alliance which had been concluded between him and the late king; and at the same time, he ordered<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polyd.

When the ambassador delivered his memorial on this subject, the council was assembled, to deliberate and give their advice, whe∣th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r or not the king ought to consummate the marriage. Warham archbishop of Canterbury, affirmed, that it was without precedent in a Christian land; that he doubted, whether the pope had power to dispense with the former mar∣riage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and therefore he looked upon this as unnatural incest. His opinion was strongly opposed by Fox bishop of Winchester, who insisted upon the un∣limited power vested in the vicar of Jesus Christ; and expatiated upon the con∣veniencies of the match, as well as upon the danger of incensing Ferdinand, and the virtues of the princess, who declared she was still a virgin; and referred to the examination of matrons for the truth of her allegations. The king him∣self espoused the sentiments of Fox; and the archbishop desisting from his op∣position, through fear of exasperating pope Julius II. one of the most enter∣prizing pontiffs that had ever filled the papal chair, the council decreed, that the marriage should be consummated, tho' not before the princess should have

<P>In the course of this year, the treaty between England and the Scot∣tish king was renewed and confirmed, by the ministry of the bishop of Mur∣ray, who had come to England, with compliments of congratulation from his brother-in-law, upon his accession to the throne. The emperor Maximilian sent an embassy of the same nature: and Henry appointed Christopher Bam∣bridge archbishop of York, his envoy at the court of Rome, to which he had repaired, to sollicit the confirmation of his holiness, upon his being translated to the see of York. It was the interest of the king of England to maintain an ambassador at Rome for intelligence at this juncture, when pope Julius was employed in forming a powerful confederacy of the European princes. He had laid the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign of reannexing to the holy see all the dominions of which it had been dismembered; and these being chiefly in the hands of the Veneti∣ans, he resolved to humble that insolent republic. His project was relished by the king of France, because they had encroached upon his dutchy of Milan; the emperor was very well disposed to concur in any measure by which he might regain some footing in Italy, which had belonged to his predecessors; and Ferdinand was glad of an opportunity to retrieve, without repayment, some places in the kingdom of Naples, which he had pawned to the Venetians for a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um of money. The duke of Ferrara wanted to recover Rovigo, and the Polesin, which were possessed by the Venetians; and the Florentines were in∣censed against that republic, for having supported Pisa, which they wanted to subdue. These were the motives of the famous league formed against Venice, at Cambrary, where the congress was opened, on pretence of accommodating the difference between Charles of Austria, and the duke of Guelderland. In order to deceive the spies of Venice, they at first concluded a treaty of perpe∣tual peace between the pope, the emperor, and the kings of France and Spain: but, at the same time, they ratified an offensive and defensive league against the
<PB N="528" REF="5380"/>
Venetians. In compliance with the conditions of this alliance, Lewis marched from Milan in the beginning of April, at the head of a numerous army; while the pope's forces entered Romagna, those of Arragon invaded Lombardy; the duke of Ferrara fell upon the Polesin; and, the emperor remained at Trent, that he might be at hand to reap the fruits of their success. In the mean time, the Venetians took the field, under the conduct of the count de Petigliano, who engaging the French at Gieradadda, was intirely defeated. Lewis, in fifteen days after this victory, made himself master of Cremona, Pexhiera, Crema, Brescia, and Bergama: Vicenza, Verona, Padua, together with Friuli, and all the towns of Istria, submitted to the emperor. The pope's general reduced Ravenna, Cervia, Faenza, and Rimini; while the duke of Ferrara recovered Rovigo: so that in the course of one short campaign, the Venetians saw all their extensive territories reduced to the single city of Venice; and the five places in the kingdom of Naples, which had been mortgaged to them by Ferdinand. Their disafter was fatal to the Pisans, who being no longer supported by that republic, were obliged to surrender to the Florentines, after a tedious siege, during which they were reduced to the utmost extremity. Lewis, having ac∣complished his aim, returned to France, after he had detached a body of troops to join the emperor, whose army was far from being in a flourishing condition. The French king's departure afforded some respite to the Venetians: they sum∣moned up all their fortitude, to repair the damages they had sustained: they brought a new army into the field, which kept Maximilian at bay, and took Padua by surprize: they appeased the pope by submission; and detached Fer∣dinand from the league, by promising to restore his five towns which they pos∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essed. By this time, pope Julius began to be terribly diq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieted by the union that seemed to subsist between the king of France and the emperor; he con∣cluded, that they had engaged in a secret treaty to subdue and divide between them the whole country of Italy.

Then the parliament passed an act of attainder, condemning Dudley and Empson, without specifying the particular crimes of which they were convicted; tho' Henry did not grant a warrant for their exe∣cution until the month of August, when the clamour of the people was so loud against them, that he thought proper to sacrifice them to the public resentment, without further delay. During this session, Lewis of France sent over ambas∣sadors to renew the treaty of Estaples, the term of which had expired at the death of the seventh Henry: and a new peace was solemnly concluded between the two kings, to be in force until one of them should prove the survivor.

This condition was altogether in favour of Ferdinand, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> seems to imply, that he had already projected some scheme against France<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for, Henry could have no prospect of being attacked from that quarter; and there∣fore by such a treaty he betrayed his own interest. But, indeed, he was so im∣mersed in pleasures, that he payed very little regard to the political maxims of government. His whole time was engrossed by tournameats, masquerades, festivals, and concerts of music, together with tennis and dice, at which games he lost considerable sums of money to foreign adventures, until he detected their frauds, and expelled them from court in the most disgraceful manner.</P>

<P>While his time passed so agreeably in these amusements, he left the care of the administration to his ministers, among whom Wolsey began al∣ready to enjoy a great share of his favour; for he was promoted to the deanery of Lincoln, and presented by the king with a fine country-house in the neigh∣bourhood of London, which had belonged to Sir Thomas Empson, lately be∣headed. The pope, having privately engaged in a league with Ferdinand and the Venetians, industriously sought an occasion of quarrelling with the king of France, by giving away a bishopric in Provence, contrary to his engagement with Lewis. When this monarch complained of the infraction, the pope denied that he had ever entered into any such engagement; and they gave one another the lie without ceremony. Julius, being thus furnished with a pretext for a rupture, found means, by the bishop of Sion, to create a dissension between the crown of France and the Swiss, who, in a die<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at Lucerne, declared for the pope, and resolved to send an army into the Milanese. His holiness was so secret in his negotiations, that Lewis, far from suspecting his intention was to form a strong league which should drive the French out of Italy, believed he had no other design but that of seizing Ferrara<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and ordered Chaumont go∣vernor of Milan to succour the duke of Ferrara, in case he should be attacked. The fleet of Venice and the pope's army, however, having attempted to sur∣prize Genoa, the king of France considered the affair in a more serious light, and directed Chaumont to keep a watchful eye over the conduct of Julius, whom that general accordingly had well nigh surprized at Bologna. The pope complained loudly of this insult at all the courts in Europe, and in particular at London. He excommunicated the French generals; made another unsuc∣cessful attempt upon Genoa, in conjunction with the Venetian gallies; sent for twelve thousand Swiss, who began their march for the Milanese, under the conduct of the bishop of Sion: but finding the passes strongly guarded, they returned to their own country. Lewis formed two successive treaties with Maximilian, by the last of which, they agreed to assemble a general council at Pisa, in order to depose Julius; and they actually gained over nine cardinals to their interest. Mean while, the pope and Venetians being joined by the Spa∣nish army from Naples, his holiness invested Mirandols in person; and the place being reduced, entered by the breach as a conqueror. When Lewis com∣plained of Ferdinand's having joined that pontiff and the Venetians, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e excused himself by saying, that as king of Naples, he was a vassal of the Roman <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Ferdinand, with a view to engage his son-in-law insensibly in their alliance against France, dissembled his real design; and, on pretence of equipping an armament against the Moors of Africa, sollicited a reinforcement of a thousand English archers. His request was immediately granted; and Thomas Darcy being created a baron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</NOTE> was nominated to the command of this small detachment. The Venetians sent ambassadors to England, under colour of thanking Henry for having used his good offices towards their reconciliation with his holiness: but their real design was to engage him in the projected league. The pope created Bambridge archbishop of York, a cardinal, and promoted Matthew Skinner bishop of Sion to the same dignity: in a word, the confederates spared no pains to gain over the ministers and agents of Henry; to persuade him, that the king of France was become too formidable by the conquest of Milan, and might, if not seasonably checked, form more important schemes to the prejudice of his neighbours. At length he gave ear to their remonstrances, and promised to join their association. He appointed commissioners to muster and arm the militia of the kingdom, on pretence of putting the nation in a posture of de∣fence, in case it should be invaded; and that he might avoid a rupture with the king of Scotland, who he knew was attached to Lewis, he appointed en∣voys to regulate all differences, which had happened since the last treaty. James, however, found a pretext, in spite of all his precautions. Andrew Breton, a Scottish merchant, having obtained from his sovereign a com∣mission to make reprisals on the Portuguese who had plundered and murdered his father on the high seas, equipped two ships of war, with which he made prize of all the Portuguese vessels that traded through the English channel. The ambassador of Portugal representing this conduct to Henry as an insult upon the English flag, he ordered two large ships to be fitted out, and bestowed the command of them upon the two sons of the earl of Surry, who attacked the Scottish corsair, and took his vessel, after an obstinate engagement, in which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anan.

The king of Scotland demanded restitution of the prizes, as well as reparation for an outrage committed against the articles of peace sub∣sisting between the two kingdoms: Henry refused the satisfaction he demanded, all<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dging, that pyrates and corsairs were never comprehended in treaties; and James protested against this refusal, as an affront which he would revenge with the first opportunity.</P>

<P>During these transactions, Lewis made some advances towards a paci∣fication with the pope; but all his proposals being rejected, he ordered Chau∣mont to carry on the war with vigour. That general, though inferior in num∣ber to the allies, commanded a body of such veterans, that they were afraid to hazard an engagement: at length he advanced towards Modena, in order to besiege that city; and the pope, rather than it should fall into the hands of Lewis, ceded it to the emperor, who began about this time to act very coldly
<PB N="531" REF="5410"/>
for the interest of his ally. Nevertheless, the army of the confederates being very hard pressed by Chaumont, Ferdinand, who still professed neutrality, pro∣posed a congress at Mantua, which produced no other effect than a delay, that was very prejudicial to the French interest. After this ineffectual effort towards an accommodation, Maximilian, who was not yet altogether detached from Lewis, consented that the council at Pisa should be summoned in his name, to meet on the first day of September, and deliberate upon measures for the reformation of the church, in its head and members. Not that Lewis was altogether free of suspicion: he was informed of a conference at Bologna, between the pope and the bishop of Gurch, the emperor's minister; and Ferdi∣nand's great preparations filled him with jealousy and distrust. Thus alarmed, he ordered Trivulci, who had succeeded to the command of his army on the death of Chaumont, to act against the enemy with all possible diligence. He accordingly took Concordia, and approached Bologna, from whence the pope retired to Ravenna, after having endeavoured in vain to persuade his allies to hazard a battle. He had no sooner withdrawn himself, than an insurrection ensued in Bologna. The cardinal of Pavia whom the pope had left governor of the place, abandoned his charge. The army of the allies, which had advanced to one of the gates, understanding this commotion, fled with the utmost precipitation, leaving their artillery, baggage, and ammunition, to the in∣habitants; and to complete the mortification of the pope, his favourite cardi∣nal of Pavia, was assassinated by his nephew the duke d' Urbino, who accused him of having lost Bologna by his cowardice. His holiness, therefore, seeing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> his army dispersed, and all his designs upon Ferrara defeated, retired from Ravenna to Rome; and on the road had the mortification, at several places, to see the placards for the council of Pisa, by which he himself was summoned to appear in person. In this extremity, he expressed a desire of seeing the diffe∣rence<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> between him and France accommodated; and Lewis accepted of his proposals, provided they should be approved by the emperor: but, the Spa∣nish fleet no sooner arrived at Naples for his service, than he raised his demands in such a manner, that Lewis plainly perceived his former proposals had been made solely with a view to gain time; and forth with ordered Trivulci to send succours to Bologna, which, with the princes of Bentivoglio, he took under his protection. Mean while, Julius, with a view to countermine the council at Pisa, issued a bull, convoking another in the church of the Lateran. When the assembly of Pisa was actually opened, he excommunicated that city, as well as Florence, to which it belonged; and laid both places under an interdict. Maxi∣milian still seemed to hesitate between his alliance with France and the proffers of the pope and Venetians; or rather he kept aloof at Inspruck, that he might take the advantage of the distress of either party.</P>

<P>Ferdinand on the other hand pretended, that his armament was de∣signed against the Moors of Afric; but as soon as he had won over his son∣in-law Henry of England, he changed his pretext, and declared, his intention was to protect the church against the violence of Lewis. He and Henry sent ambassadors to that monarch, requiring him to desist from his hostilities against the pope; otherwise, as christian princes, they could not help defending the church, which was distressed by his ambition. Lewis perceiving that their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> measures were already taken, would not deign to justify his conduct; but re∣turned
<PB N="532" REF="5420"/>
such a lofty answer as they wanted to receive. Immediately after this transaction, the pope, the king of Arragon, and the Venetians, concluded a league at Rome, leaving a place for the king of England, tho' his ambassador cardinal Bambridge did not sign the treaty. Henry hoped to conclude a separate al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance, which should be more advantageous to England, than this league, which only respected the interests of Italy, or rather the convenience of the pope; for, the professed aim of it was to retrieve the city of Bologna, and all the other territories which had been wrested from the holy see, by any prince or person whatsover. In the midst of these negotiations, the council of Pisa held two sessions in that city, although Julius had excommunicated all the car∣dinals and prelates of which it was composed, as well as all the princes by whom it was countenanced; but, an insurrection of the populace disturbing their deliberations, they transferred the council to Milan, where they thought they might take their measures with more safety. Among the adherents of Lewis was John d'Albret king of Navarre, who no sooner declared for the coun∣cil of Pisa, than Ferdinand formed the design of depriving him of his king∣dom on this pretence, and resolved to use Henry of England as the instrument, for putting this design in execution. He gave him to understand, that this was a favourable opportunity for recovering Guienne, which had belonged to his predecessors, as the Italian league would find such employment for Lewis, that he should not be in a condition to defend his own country. That as Guienne was so remote from England, he (Ferdinand) from his affection to Henry, would supply him with troops, transports, artillery, and ammunition, without desiring any advantage for himself, but the pleasure of contributing to the success of his son-in-law. This was the bait which allured Henry to enterheartily into the league with the pope, the king of Arragon, and the Venetians; as well as to violate the peace which he had so solemnly renewed with France, and which was so much for the interest of England. Far from interfering in the affairs of Italy, he ought to have encouraged Lewis in his designs upon that country, the prosecution of which would have effectually secured his kingdom from any danger of a French invasion.</P>

<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>In about six weeks after the ratification of the league of Rome, Henry and Ferdinand concluded another at London, in the preamble to which they expatiated upon the ambition and impiety of the French king, who had waged war against his holiness; made himself master of Bologna; endea∣voured to surprize the person of the pope, an old, infirm valetudinary; routed the army of the holy see; and refused to abstain from such cruel hostilities, when advised by the king of Arragon, and England, ro reconcile himself with the spiritual father of Christendom. In consequence of this obstinacy, they had for the praise and glory of God almighty, our lord Jesus Christ, and the whole triumphant host of heaven; for the defence, exaltation, and increase of the catholic faith, the christian religion, and the holy Roman church, unjustly op∣pressed; engaged in a solemn league and alliance, importing, That the two kings should undertake the defence and protection of the holy Roman see, against all aggressors: That Ferdinand should take arms for that purpose in Italy: and, That with the same view of protecting the holy see, they should distress the king of France, by carrying the war into Guienne, which should be conquered for the king of England, to whom it of right belonged. For the
<PB N="533" REF="5430"/>

<P>Immediately after the conclusion of this treaty, which was commu∣nicated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

A war with France was never unwelcome to the English people. The commons voted a considera∣ble subsidy; and several laws were enacted, relating to the conduct of the expe∣dition. At length the session broke up, after having removed the attainder of Sir<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert.</NOTE> Edmund Dudley, and restored his son John to the rank, estate, and honours of his family. Then Henry sent Silvester bishop of Worcester, and Sir Robert Wing∣field, as his ambassadors to the council of the Lateran, with full power to con∣sent, in his name, to every decree that should be made for the reformation of the church, in its head and members. This step being taken, he conferred the command of his fleet upon Edward Howard, eldest son of the earl of Surry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that of the army destined to act on shore, on Thomas Grey marquis of Dorset. The troops intended for the Guienne expedition, embarking in the month of May, arrived in the province of Guipuscoa about the beginning of June, where they landed with the general, and met with a very cordial re∣ception from the commissioners of Ferdinand. Admiral Howard, who had conveyed them thither, in his return made a descent upon the coast of Britanny, from whence he carried off a considerable booty. He afterwards received a rein∣forcement, which Henry <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent upon hearing, that the French king had fitted out a powerful navy; and the enemy sailing from Brest, both <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eets met in the channel, where a desperate engagement ensued. In the course of the battle, the Regent, a large ship, commanded by Sir Thomas Knevit, grappled with the Cor∣deliere, one of the strongest ships of France, the captain of which finding him∣self overpowered, set fire to the magazine, and blew up both vessels<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so that every person on board of them perished, to the amount of sixteen hundred chosen men. This dreadful scene interrupted the combat, and affected both sides in such
<PB N="534" REF="5440"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> a manner, that they had no inclination to renew the engagement. The French retired to Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; and the English remained masters of the channel.</P>

<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>Ferdinand, notwithstanding the terms of his league with Henry, had no other intention but that of conquering Navarre; and therefore his general, the duke of Alva, instead of joining the marquis of Dorset, who had encamped at Fontarabia, with a view to invest Bayonne, remained at Logrogno with his forces, alledging that it would be dangerous to undertake the siege of Bayonne, while the king of Navarre continued attached to the interest of Lewis; because while they should be employed at the siege he might introduce the French into his dominions; and, encamping between the mountains and the sea, cut off their convoys, without hazarding a battle. He therefore proposed that they should try to bring over that prince to their measures, before they should em∣bark in such an important enterprize. The marquis, persuaded by this remon∣strance, dispatched an English officer, to desire the king of Navarre to join the allies; and Ferdinand sent him a message to the same purpose. He declared he would observe an exact neutrality; but, they pressing him either to join them, or deliver four places for their security, he rejected their proposals, without he∣sitation. Mean while a French army, commanded by the duke of Longue∣ville, approaching the frontiers of Bearne, the marquis complained, that the time lost in the negotiation with the king of Navarre had given the French an opportuity to come and defend their frontiers; and he insisted upon knowing whether or not Ferdinand would attack Guienne, according to the treaty of London. The king of Arragon replied, that it would be imprudent in him to let his army march to Fontarabia, and besiege Bayonne, while his own domi∣nions should be left exposed to invasion from the enemy; that it would be more for their advantage to march through Navarre, and secure three or four places of that kingdom, by way of prevention. He, for this reason, expressed a desire that the English troops would join the duke of Alva for that purpose; and he did not doubt that the king of Navarre would engage in the league, as soon as he should find himself hard pressed, so as to justify his conduct, should he be questioned by Lewis; in which case the siege of Bayonne would be un∣dertaken with a much better prospect of success. The English general gave him to understand, that he had no instructions to act against the king of Na∣varre; and that he could not resolve to make such a long circuit as would be necessary for joining the duke of Alva. Ferdinand, not satisfied with this an∣swer, still pressed him to join his army; and in the mean time ordered his ge∣neral to invest Pampeluna, the capital of Navarre, which in a little time sur∣rendered upon capitulation; while the king of that country retired to France, and entered into a treaty with Lewis for their mutual defence. After the re∣duction of Pampeluna, Ferdinand, instead of joining the English forces, ac∣cording to his promise, ordered the duke of Alva to continue his conquests; while the troops, under the marquis of Dorset, served as an army of obser∣vation, and intimidated the French from entering Navarre; so that the Spa∣nish general was enabled to subdue the greatest part of that kingdom, without interruption. The king of Arragon, in the mean time, dispatched a messenger to England, to cajole Henry with an unfair account of his proceedings; and, as the king of England had received no intelligence, to the contrary, from the marquis of Dorset, he, at the request of Ferdinand, ordered that general to
<PB N="535" REF="5450"/>
co-operate with the Spanish army. Before the marquis received this order, the duke of Alba reduced St. Jean de pied de port; and then the king of Arragon offered, that if the marquis of Dorset would join his forces, they should march directly into Guienne, and besiege Bayonne; but this proposal was rejected, as an impracticable scheme, by the marquis, who knew that the French army was intrenched between Bayonne and Salvatierra; so that he could not pass the river Bidassoa, without running the risk of losing his forces; and, Bayonne was by this time so well provided, that it could not be besieged with any hope of success.</P>

<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>Ferdinand was well acquainted with these circumstances; and the sole design of his proposal was to obtain a pretence for charging upon the mar∣quis the whole blame of leaving Guienne uninvaded. That nobleman, incensed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peter Martyr.</NOTE> at his disingenuous conduct, and seeing his army daily diminish by sickness and<NOTE PLACE="marg">R.

These were granted, with a seeming reluctance, by Ferdinand, who, though he protested against their departure, was very little concerned at their retreat, because he had already made himself master of the whole king∣dom of Navarre. At this period the marquis of Dorset falling<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sick, was suc∣ceeded in command by lord Thomas Howard; and just as the troops were ready to embark, the herald arrived with an order to the general to obey king Ferdinand in all his directions. These news produced a mutiny in the army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> which could not be restrained from embarking; and, when they were returned to their own country, the king was at first incensed against the general: but his indignation subsided when he was informed of all the transactions of the cam∣paign, by which he plainly perceived that he had been egregiously duped by his father-in-law. He found it convenient, however, to dissemble and tem∣porise, lest Ferdinand should leave him in the lurch, by making a separate ac∣commodation with Lewis. Before the end of the year, the king of Arragon was in full possession of Navarre, which he had no other pretext for retaining but the pope's bull, denouncing excommunication against John d'Albret, king of Navarre; and bestowing his dominions upon the prince by whom they should be first conquered. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE></P>

<P>During these transactions in Navarre, the army of the allies in Italy, commanded by the viceroy of Naples, undertook the siege of Bologna; but they were obliged to lay aside that enterprize at the approach of Gaston de Foix, duke de Nemours, who afterwards routed them near Ravenna, but was himself killed in the pursuit: then all the towns of Romagna surrendered voluntarily to the cardinal St. Severin, who attended the French army as legate from the council of Pisa, translated to Milan. The cardinals at Rome were so terrified at these events, that they went in a body, and supplicated Julius to make peace with France; but he had resources of which they were ignorant. The Swiss, at the instigation of the cardinal of Sion, resolved to invade the dutchy of Mi∣lan; and la Palisse, the French general, being apprized of their preparations, hastened to the defence of that country, leaving St. Severin with a small body of troops in the Romagna; so that Rome was freed of its apprehensions, and Julius opened the council of the Lateran. Immediately after the retreat of la Palisse, the towns of Romagna submitted to the pope; Lewis was fain to send an army into Bearn, to hinder the English and Spaniards from invading Gui∣enne;
<PB N="5$6" REF="5460"/>
the emperor concluded a truce with the Venetians, and withdrew his troops from the army of France left to defend the Milanese; so that cardinal St. Severin was recalled for the succour of that dutchy. Sixteen thousand Swiss began their march for Italy by the way of Trent, through which they were al∣lowed free passage by Maximilian, who excused himself to Lewis, by saying, that his alliance with the cantons would not allow him to refuse them a passage through his dominions. Being joined by the Venetians at Verona, they ap∣proached Milan: Palisse, being so weakened that he could not pretend to op∣pose their progress, resolved to repass the mountains, and retire to France; and he was immediately followed by the fathers of the council, which, by a hasty decree, was transferred from Milan to Lyon. All the places of the Milanese immediately surrendered to the Swiss and Venetians, except Parma, Placentia, and Reggio. Alexander Bentivoglio quitted Bologna, which was abandoned to the pope's discretion; so that, by a very surprizing revolution, that pontiff recovered Ravenna, Bologna, the whole country of Romagna; and the French were driven from Italy. On this occasion the allies held a congress at Mantua, where they agreed that Maximilian S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orza should be re-established in Milan, and the house of Medicis at Florence. The inhabitants of this last city received the individuals of that family as private citizens; but, the cardinal of Medicis, entering the place while the army of the confederates was at the gates, introduced a good number of officers and soldiers, by which means he excited an insur∣rection, that rendered him master of the place; and the sovereignty of his<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> house was re-established.</P>

<P>A second assembly was held at Rome, at the desire of the pope, who wanted to persuade his allies to act against the duke of Ferrara, and to effect a peace between the emperor and the Venetians, so as that Maximilian should abandon the council at Lyon. The duke of Ferrara was protected by the king of Arragon, and the Venetians refused to supply the pope with troops and mo∣ney to subdue that dutchy: as to the peace between the emperor and the repub∣lic, it was re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dered impracticable by the intolerable terms which Maximilian pretended to impose. At length, Julius, resolving at all hazards to disso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve the council of Pisa, and hinder Lewis from re-entering Italy, engaged with the em∣peror in a league offensive and defensive, against Venice. Maximilian con∣sented to the pope's keeping Parma, Placentia, and Reggio, saving still the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghts of the empire; to renounce the council of Pisa, and abandon the duke of Ferrara, and the Bentivoglios. Julius engaged to assist the emperor with all his power, to launch his thunder against the Venetians, and declare them ex∣cluded from the league of Rome. This treaty being ratified, Maximilian re∣nounced the assembly of Pisa, and Sforza was put in possession of the dutchy of Milan, according to the resolution taken by the allies at Mantua.</P>

<P>Henry king of England, notwithstanding his late experience of Ferdinand's double-dealing, allowed himself to be amused again by that prince and his allies. They gave him to understand, that having nothing to fear from Italy, they would now unite their forces, in order to invade France; so that he could not fail to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> recover Guienne and Normandy. He forthwith sent am∣bassadors to Brussels, to conclude a league against Lewis, with the pope, the emperor, the king of Arragon, and Charles of Austria, sovereign of the Low<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b.</NOTE> Countries. Then he assembled a parliament, to demand a subsidy, which was
<PB N="537" REF="5470"/>
chearfully granted; and, during this session, he received a bull from the pope, granting a plenary indulgence to all his subjects who should assist him in this war, with their persons or money. Henry would willingly have lived in peace with his brother-in-law, James king of Scotland; but that prince, partly from the maxims of policy, and partly from his resentment of Henry's refu∣sing to give him satisfaction in the affair of Barton, was altogether byassed in favour of Lewis. He fitted out a fleet of ships, under the command of Andrew Barton, brother to the corsair of that name; and this officer took a great number of English vessels. As soon as Henry declared war against France, James engaged in a league with Lewis, and began to assemble an army for making an irruption into England, after the forces of that kingdom should have embarked in the expedition to the continent. Henry, alarmed at the Scottish armament, sent two ambassadors to expostulate with James; who said, That being allied to both crowns, his intention was to observe an exact neutra∣lity: but the king of England, being afterwards informed of his league with Lewis, appointed the earl of Surry warden of the northern provinces, with power to raise an army, and act against Scotland, in case of necessity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

<P>While affairs remained in this situation, pope Julius II. died, and was succeeded in the papacy by cardinal John de Medicis, who assumed the name of Leo X. and began his pontificate in the thirty-seventh year of his age. He was not so fiery and insolent as his predecessor, but possessed a great fund of art and address; and was already well experienced in the political tran∣sactions of Europe, as he had been employed by Julius in the most important negotiations. He accordingly prosecuted the plan which that pontiff had pro∣jected. He was doubly interested to keep the French out of Italy, as pope and a prince of the house of Medicis; and he was bent upon the ruin of the council of Pisa, which he could not effect, without exciting wars against Lewis, which should compel him to make peace with the church. Ferdinand's aim was to employ the French king, at a distance from Navarre, Roussillon, and Naples<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the emperor wished that France might be disabled from assisting the Ve∣netians: but, as none of these powers were inclined to carry the war into the dominions of Lewis, their business was to find some other power, who should make this diversion: and, for that purpose, they cast their eyes upon Henry king of England, who had plenty of money and warlike subjects; and was fired with the ambition o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distinguishing himself by some atchievement of impor∣tance. All the allies, therefore, separately encouraged him to undertake the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Never was less sincerity mani<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested in any negotiation. Of all the confederates Henry alone intended to fulfil his en∣gagements. The pope never ratified the treaty; Ferdinand disavowed his ambassador, by whom it had been confirmed; and the emperor received Henry's money, without any design of observing the other articles.</P>

<P>In the mean time the Venetians concluded a league with Lewis, who immediately sent an army into Italy, under the command o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> La Tremouille; at whose arrival on the confines of the Milaness, Sfor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a abandoned his capital, and took refuge among the Swiss; who, to the number o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> six or seven thou∣sand, had taken post at Como and Novara, where they expected a reinforce∣ment of their countrymen.

<P>While the French and Venetians experienced these vicissitudes of fortune in Italy, the king of England employed all his attention in preparing a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eet and army for his expedition into France. By this time, Thomas Wolsey had been created a privy counsellor; and, by his insinuating address, become a favourite with Henry, as well as the companion of all his pleasures. Not that his talents were limited to the arts of a courtier; he made it his business to acquire a perfect in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight into state-affairs. He pointed out the impolitic steps which the king had taken since his accession to the throne. He discovered and demo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>strated the craft and selfishness of his allies, who had taken such advan∣tage of the king's youth and inexperience, and convinced him of the necessity o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> choo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing an able minister, for the management of his most difficult affairs <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> home and abroad. He himself became that very minister, and the king re∣po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the utmost confidence in his attachment and abilities.

<P>Henry, having finished his preparations, summoned his allies to ful<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il their several engagements according to the treaty of Mechlin. The pope had no intention to send an army into Provence; the emperor was in no con∣dition to enter Burgundy. The king of Arragon had privately concluded a truce for one year with Lewis, and even comprehended the king of England, without his knowledge. Henry, being informed of this tran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction, was so incensed, that he sent an ambassador to reproach his father-in-law for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ceitful conduct, and summon him to execute the treaty of Mechlin, which his envoy had solemnly ratified in his name at London. Ferdinand now alledged that this envoy had exceeded his instructions; that he had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the necessity of his affairs to conclude the truce with Lewis; but he promi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to exert himself vigorously after it should be expired, and advised hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> son-in-law to accede to the suspension: in which case they would afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ite their forces, and act together against the common enemy. Henry would no longer depend upon his promise<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and now, for the first time, discovered the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce∣rity of his allies, and found himself subjected to the expence of a war against France, which he expected would have been attacked at the same time from four different quarters. About this time, he received a letter of ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e from the emperor, giving him to understand, that he could not possibly invade Burgundy till next year; but, in the mean time, he would serve in person as a volunteer in the army of England.

<P>James, without waiting for this answer, entered Northumberland in the month of August, at the head of a numerous army, and reduced No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ham, with several other places. This expedition was hastened by the defeat of the earl of Hume, who had been sent with six thousand men, to make an in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r∣sion into England; and in his return <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell into an ambush laid by Sir William Bulmer, who routed him at the pass of Broomhouse. This disgrace exasperated James, and induced him to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cipita<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e his invasion, contrary to the advice of his nobles, and the inclination of his queen, who exerted all her influence in dissuading him from the enterprize. He remained, however, dea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to all those rem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstrances; and suffered him<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf to be hurried to his own ruin by a false punctilio, aided by the insinuation of De la Mothe the French ambassador. The earl of Surry was no sooner informed of his motions, than he appointed Newcastle as the place of r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vous for the forces of the northern counties<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and on the thirtieth day of August, he was there joined by the lord Dacres, Sir Wil∣liam Bulmer, Sir Marmaduke Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>table, and many other persons of di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion. James, since the reduction of Norham, had lost some precious time in i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce with the daughter of a northern baron, owner of the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le of Ford; and the English general resolved to go in quest of him without delay. On the third day of September he marched to Alnwic, where he was rein<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ced by his own son the lord admiral, at the he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of five thousand chosen men<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so that the army now amounted to six and twenty thousand men eage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for battle. James had taken possession of a strong ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p on a mountain called F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dden-hill, in the neighbourhood of Ford, where he indulged himself in his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>morous commerce, so as to give umbrage to the best and wisest of his subjects.

had gained. The earl of Angus returned to Scotland in disgust; and the earl of Hume, with many others, expressed such indifference, at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch a juncture, as even amounted to treachery. In a word, the king of Scotland saw his troops diminished one half; but, he was so advantageously posted, that the English could not attack him with any probability of success. The earl of Surry, knowing his disposition, sent an herald with a defiance, couched in the most provoking terms; and James declared he would give him battle on the Friday following. Surry forthwith drew up his army in order of battle, and march∣ing to Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er-ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh, within three miles of the Scottish camp, made a motion towards the left, along the river Till, which he passed, and then directed his march towards the Tw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, as if he intended to cut off the communication be∣tween the enemy and Scotland.</P>

<P>The country was by this time so wasted by the Scots, the roads so broken, and the rivers so swelled by the rains, that he would have found it im∣possible to establish magazines, or subsist for any length of time, while the enemy enjoyed abundance. The Scots were not ignorant of the advantages they possessed; and the earl of Huntley, in a council of war, expatiated upon them with great strength of argument; observing, that it would be madness to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight the English on their own terms, especially as they were superior in num∣ber of men; and that in a few days they would be obliged to retire for want of provision. James rejected this advice, as a proposal that derogated from his ho∣nour, and determined to fight them according to his promise. He forthwith ordered his hutts to be set on fire; and, under favour of the smoke, quitted his advantageous situation, that he might draw up his army in the plain, where he already found the English in order of battle, so near, that his artillery planted on the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clivity of a hill, could do no execution. They were formed into three lines; the first commanded by the lord admiral; the second by Sir Edwa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Howard; and Sir Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aduke Constable; and the third by the earl of Surry, assisted by the lord D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cres, and Sir Edward Stanley. The king of Scotland drew up his ar∣my on the ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing-ground, not without great damage from the English artillery, planted at the pass of Mill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield. The command of the van was given to the earl of Huntley; the second line was commanded by the earls of Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nox and Argyle; while the earls of Crawford and Montrose conducted the body of re∣serve; and James himself acted as a volunteer in his own army. Huntley charged the division of Howard with such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury, that it was immediately put in confusion and routed: but, it was so seasonably supported by the lord Dacres, that the men rallied, and the battle became general. Both sides fought for a long time with incredible impetuosity, until the Highlanders being galled by the English artillery, broke in sword in hand upon the main body commanded by the earl of Surry; and at the head of these, James <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought in person with the most forward of his nobility. They attacked with such velocity, that the o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her line could not advance in time to sustain them<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so that a body of the English intercepted their ret<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat: the earls of Craw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord and Montrose were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outed by the lord admiral, and his rallied forces, while the earl of Hume and his followers stood inactive, without making the least motion to their assist∣ance. In the mean time, James being almost surrounded by the enemy, refused <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o quit the field, while it was yet in his power. He scorned to survive the disgrace of a d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eat: but, alighting from his horse, formed his little body into an orb, re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olving that the English should pay dear for the victor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought with such desperate courage as re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tored the battle; and even obliged the English to avoid the close <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, and have resource to their arrows and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>til∣lery, which made terrible havock. The earls of Montrose, Crawford, Argyle, and Lennox, were killed upon the spot, with the bravest of their men; and the king of Scotland is said to have fallen in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> midst of his slaugh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered subjects. The engagement, however, was protracted until night parted the co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts The darkness favoured the retreat of the Scots; and the English did not think<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polyd. Virgil. Hall. Hollingshed. Drake.</NOTE> the victory ascertained, until next day, when they found themselves masters of the field; and the enemy's artillery. Ten thousand Scots are said to have perished on this occasion; and the victors lost about half that number. A body, sup∣posed to be that of James, was inclosed in a leaden coff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and sent to London<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where it remained unburied, until it was absolved by the pope of the sentence of excommunication, which he had incurred on account of his attachment to Lewis. The Scottish historians pretend, that this was not the body of James, but of a young gentleman called Elphinston, who, as well as several other vo∣lunteers, were habited like the king, that his danger might be the more divided. They alledge, that James was seen on the other side of the Tw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter the battle; and that he was assassinated by the earl of Home, who bore an invetera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e grudge to his person.

<P>Henry, notwithstanding the laurels he had gathered in the course of this summer, began to be tired of the war with France, in proportion as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e became more and more convinced of the treachery of his allies. After the battle of Guinegaste, the Swiss, instigated by the pope and the emperor, made an irruption into Burgundy, and invested Dijon, which was defended by L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tremouille lately returned from Italy. This officer, finding himself reduced to ex∣tremity, concluded a capitulation with the besiegers, by which he bound him∣self to pay four hundred thousand crowns; and promised, in his master's name, that the king should renounce all his pretensions to the dutchy of Milan. The Swiss received twenty thousand crowns of the money from La Tremouille, and four hostages, with which they returned very well satisfied to their own country: but, these found means to escape, when Lewis refused to ratify the capitulation. That monarch finding himself unable to cope with so many adversaries, resolved to reconcile himself to the pope, who having no personal enmity against him, and being now rid of his fears for Italy, exacted no other condition, but that of his renouncing the co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncil of Pisa, which he immediately abandoned. The accommodation was no sooner effected, than Leo se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a brief to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Henry, exhorting him earnestly to a peace, as he had taken up arms for the defence of the holy see, and already accomplished that purpose, by his victories over her enemy, in consequence of which he had returned to his ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dience. Henry's eyes were now fully opened. He and his allies had used the pret<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of defend∣ing the church, as a pretence only, to cover their own separate intere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts: and now the pope had accomplished his own aim, he pretended to interp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣amble of their league in the literal acceptation.

Such an alliance would have been very agreeable to Maximilian and Ferdi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and: but, the pope could not behold the prospect of it without the utmost disquiet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for, he was not more afraid of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeing Milan in the hands of the French, than of its being po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed by a grandson of the emperor, and king of Arragon. He and the Swiss passionately de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired to see the family of the Sforzas in po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion of that dutchy. The chief <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m of the Venetians was, to procure an equitable peace with th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> emperor, which they could not obtain without the assistance of France; and this was not to be acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red but by aidi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g Lewis to recover the Milane<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.

For this purpose he acted a great variety of parts; sometimes he as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sted the empe∣ror again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Venice; sometimes he used his good offices with Maximilian, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour of the republic; at other times he instigated the pope and the Swiss against Lewis; and then he offered his assistance to that prince, in conquering the dutchy of Milan. His whole conduct was made up of artifice and deceit, prac∣tised for his own selfish purposes: but, at length his cunning overshot itself; for, he lost his reputation to such a degree, that no prince, would con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide in his pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions. Pope Leo, alarmed at the negotiation which Lewis had renewed with the emperor, endeavoured to reconcile the French king with the Swiss, that he might be the less disposed to uni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with Maximilian, and the king of Arragon; but, all his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fforts proved ine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ectual. Ferdinand, afraid of being l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft alone in the lurch, prolonged the truce for another year with Lewis; and his holiness en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eavoured to promote an accommodation between the emperor and the Vene∣tians, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the French might be discourag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from revisiting Italy.

<P>While the pope took these measures to render the mini<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter of Eng∣land propitious to his views, Lewis king of France made overtures of peace to Henry, by means of the duke of Longueville, who had been taken in the battle of Guinegaste. That nobleman acted as a private ambassador, in open∣ing the eyes of the English monarch with regard to the conduct of his allies; and, demanded his sister Mary in marriage for Lewis, who had left his wife Anne of Britanny in the beginning of the preceding year. No Eng∣lishman was privy to this negotiation but the king himself, and Wol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey bishop of Lincoln, until both parties had agreed to almost all the articles pro∣posed; and then the French king sending over two public ambassadors, a ces∣sation of arms took place while the affair was on the carpet. After some debate and difficulty, three different treaties were signed on the seventh day of August. The first imported, That peace and friendship should subsist until one of the parties should die; and that his successor should within the year give notice to the survivor, whether or not he would renew the treaty: That all impositions laid within two and fifty years, by either king, to the prejudice of the other's subjects, should be abolished: That this peace should not be deemed broken and annulled on account of whatever violations might be committed on either side: That one party should not afford refuge and protection to the other's rebels. Both kings obliged themselves to assist each other, for the mutual defence of their dominions: for the recovery of territories retained by other princes, and in case of either's being attacked on account of this treaty: in which the pope, the Swiss, and the king of Scotland, were comprehended as the allies of Lewis, while Henry nominated as his friends, the pope, Bologna, with all the cities of St. Peter's patrimony, the archduke of Austria, and the Swiss. The second treaty stipulated, That the marriage between Lewis and the prin∣cess Mary should be contracted by proxy, and celebrated in ten days after the date of the treaty: That the king of England should send the princess at his own expence to Abbeville: and, That the French king should consummate the nuptials in four days after her arrival: That Mary's dower should amount to four hundred thousand crowns, one half of which should be expended in jew∣els: and, That in case of requisition, Lewis should not be obliged to restore above that value: That, with regard to the other half, Henry should pay it by giving an acquittance to the French king, for so much of one million which Lewis obliged himself by this treaty to pay to the king of England: That the jointure of Mary should be as great as that which had been assigned to any queen of France; and, in case of her surviving Lewis, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should have it in her power to live in France or England, according to her own <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> In the third treaty Lewis acknowledged, That Charles VII. of France had, in the pacification of Estaples, engaged to pay to Henry VII. of England and his su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sors, the sum of seven hundred and fifty thousand crowns, the arrears of which it was incumbent upon him (Lewis) to discharge: That his father Charles

<P>Mean while Francis began to make great preparations for his Ita∣lian expedition; and Ferdinand, being apprehensive that his real design was upon Navarre, engaged in a league with the emperor, the duke of Milan, and the Swi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, for obstructing his progress, whether he should attack that kingdom, or penetrate into Italy. The pope himself acceded privately to this treaty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and sent an army into Lombardy, under the command of Laurence de Medi∣cis. The king of Arragon raised forces for the defence of Navarre, and the Swiss <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent troops to take possession of the passes into Italy: but Ferdinand no sooner understood the real design of France, than he disbanded his army which he had raised for the protection of Navarre, and forbad the viceroy of Naples, who commanded his forces in Italy, to join the allies. The emperor continued inactive at Insp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uck, according to custom, and Leo made no motion towards assisting the Swiss, who were left to bear the whole burthen of the war.

The negotiation was already pretty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar advanced, when they received a rein∣forcement of fifteen thousand men, and not only rejected his proposal, but re∣solved to give him ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le without delay.

<P>By this time Henry king of England began to alter in his dis∣position towards Francis: he became jealous and envious of that monarch's greatness and glory; and he was instigated against him by Wolsey, who wanted to gratify his animosity against the French king, for having done him ill of∣fices with the pope, concerning the bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hopric of Tournay, of which the Eng∣lish minister was administrator.

He had hoped to succ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Bam∣bridge both as cardinal and archbishop of York; and employed as his sollici∣tor, at the court of Rome, cardinal Adrian de Cornetto, the pope's collator in England, whose deputy in this office was Polydore Vergil, the historian.

<P>Notwithstanding the joy with which he received the news of his promotion, he would not forgive the author of his elevation for the injury he sustained at his hands in the affair of Tournay; but resolved to engage Henry in a new league against France. His three predominant passions were pride, in∣terest, and revenge; and these three he resolved to gratify on this occasion. He wanted to shew that even sovereigns should not offend him with impunity. He consulted his revenge in distressing Francis; and his interest in preserving the admini<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tration of the bishopric of Tournay, which he had no prospect of retain∣ing any other way than by a rupture between France and England. The king was wholly guided by his counsels, without perceiving his ascendancy. Ri∣chard Fox, bishop of Winchester, his benefactor, together with the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, received such mortifications from this imperious pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣late, as obliged them to retire from court, that they might be no longer exposed to his insolence; and the rest of the privy council was chiefly composed of his crea∣tures. He now fomented the king's passions against Francis, by exaggerating the greatness and glory of that monarch, and insinuating that it was the interest of England to humble his prid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and hinder him from growing more powerful. When he had thus prepared the king's disposition, he gave the emperor to un∣derstand that it would not be impossible to detach his master from the interest of Francis; and, in the mean time, he prevailed upon Henry to renew the al∣liance between Spain and England, notwithstanding the repeated per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idy of<NOTE PLACE="marg">L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

Henry, on this occasion, convoked a general council, to which the bishop of Winchester, and the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, were parti∣cularly summoned. The cardinal opened the assembly with a studied speech against Francis, endeavouring to demonstrate that it was the interest of Eng∣land to oppose the progress of his ambition. His sentiments were espoused by the bishop of Durham, and the majority of the members; but the antient coun∣sellors dissuaded the king from infringing the peace to which he had so solemnly sworn; and advised him to turn his arms against Scotland, where the French

The English clergy were now subject to a new pope of their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

Since his being invested with the dignity of cardinal, he had become more vain, proud, and imperious than ever. He never appeared in public without the retinue of a sovereign prince. His cardinal's hat was carried as a trophy before him; and, when he entered the chapel, placed upon the altar. He was preceded by his serjeant at arms and mace, two gentlemen carrying pillars of silver, and his cross-bearer. His habit was of silk; and the very harness of his horses em∣broidered with gold. Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, was shocked at his o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tentation; and still more chagrined at his presumption, in ordering the cross of York to be carried erect in the province of Canterbury. Knowing himself unable to cope with Wolsey in point of interest, he begged leave to retire to his own see, and resign the office of chancellor, which was immediately con∣ferred on the favourite cardinal, whom the king enabled to support his assu∣med dignity with continual benefactions of prebends, wardships, and other perquisites. Besides the income of his archbishopric and office of chancellor, he farmed at a mean price the sees of Bath, Wells, and Hereford, possessed by Italians residing at Rome; and his avarice increased with his revenue. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

In this treaty a place was left for Henry of England, whom the pope earnestly exhorted, to concur in opposing the progress of the Turks against the Mamelukes of Aegypt, alledging, that the infidels, after hav∣ing subdued the Aegyptians, would certainly turn their arms against the Chri∣stians: but, it afterwards appeared, that the sole design of his holiness was, to enrich himself and his family with the spoils of Christendom.

<P>The same pretext he used for selling plenary indulgences at a very moderate price, to all who would purchase their salvation. Christendom was divided into different departments, in which collectors were appointed to re∣ceive the money, together with certain priests instructed to preach up the utility of the indulgences. The archbishop of Mentz, who nominated the preachers in Germany, assigned the province of Saxony to the Jacobins, whereas in the preceding crusades, that employment had been always bestowed upon the Augu∣stines. These last were so incensed at this supposed injury, that they indus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri∣ously sifted the conduct of the preachers as well as the collectors, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h they exposed, ridiculed, and censured in public. Martin Luther, an Augustine monk,
<PB N="552" REF="5620"/>
and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ofessor of theology in the new university of Wirtemberg, wrote against those agents; and in his writings inserted some severe animadversions against the nature of the indulgences. By these bold attacks he incurred the re∣sentment of a great number of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cclesia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ics, and their opposition insensibly en∣gaged him in a careful examination of the authority on which indulgences were<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> founded. He was soon satisfied of their being altogether unsupported by scrip∣ture; and from that day laboured to disabuse the public with respect to their opinion of the papal power: tho' he is said to have been animated by the dic∣ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of private resentment, in forwarding the reformation, which soon diffused itself over great part of Germany; and afterwards extended into other coun∣tries. The pope payed very little regard at first to L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther's efforts, thinking it impossible, that a simple monk could ever affect the power and authority of the sovereign pontiff; he therefore continued to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell his indulgences, and to exhort all good christians to contribute towards the success of such a necessary war. Among others he applied to the king of England, whom he extolled with the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t extravagant encomiums, for his zeal in behalf of holy church; and then demanded a subsidy of two hundred thousand ducats, tho' he did not succeed in this negotiation.</P>

Though he at first seemed to decline this honour, it made an impression upon his mind; and now that the emperor was in the Low Countries on a visit to his grandson, he sent the bishop of Winchester, and doctor Cuthbert Tonstal, to treat with him on the subject, and propose an interview. Maximilian told them, he would spare their king the trouble of crossing the sea, by going in person to England; but, when they talked to him on the other subject, he answered with equivocation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought to evade his promise, on various pretences; alledging, that he must first obtain the consent of the diet, that he himself might re∣tain the title of king of the Romans, and render it hereditary in his family: at other times, he said his intention was to procure the imperial crown to his grandson Charles, to create Henry king of the Romans, and to erect Austria into a kingdom for Ferdinand the brother of Charles. From these vague de∣clarations, the ambassadors concluded, that he had no intention to part with the imperial crown; and that his original proposal was no more than a scheme of adulation to extort money from the king of England. Henry had very little reason to be chagrined at his being disappointed in the hope of such a troublesome dignity. He ruled over a wealthy nation, which intirely acqui∣esced in his government; and the tranquillity of his people was uninter∣rupted, except by petty commotions, which were easily quelled. One of these happened at this juncture, in the city of London, where the apprentices raised a riot against foreigners, some of whom were robbed and murdered. The earls of Salisbury and Surry assembling the inns of court men, cleared the streets of the populace; and in about three days after the riot, the duke of Norfolk en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring the city at the head of thirteen hundred armed men, joined the mayor, and proceeded legally against the offenders.

<P>Though there was not one prince in Europe that thought the pope was really in earnest in his project for a general league against the Infidels, or even believed such a scheme practicable, almost every individual potentate used it as a pretext for covering his own interested de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igns.

Charles king of Spain made use of the same pretence for the same purpose;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1518.</NOTE> and as he had occasion for some years of peace, strenuously insisted upon the conclusion of a general truce, that the christian princes might be at liberty to unite their forces against the Infidels. Such a proposal could not be disagree∣able to the French king, alarmed by the defensive league which had been formed against him, and eager to recover Tournay, which he could not hope to retrieve in time of peace; and Henry VIII. was glad to engage in the alli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce formed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> by the pope, the emperor, the kings of France and Spain; because his re∣fusal might have furnished them with a pretence for undertaking something to his prejudice.

<P>The king of France foreseeing that he should never be able to re∣trieve Tournay, without gaining over to his interest cardinal Wol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey, who was administrator of that bishopric, spared neither flattery, promises, nor pre∣sents, to render that prelate propitious to his views; and at length, he pre∣vailed upon him to agree to the restitution, on condition that the car∣dinal should be indemnified for the loss of the administration, by a yearly pen∣sion: that the French king should pay six hundred thousand crowns to Henry for the city of Tournay: and, that a match should be effected between the dau∣phin and the princess Mary, daughter to the king of England. This private convention being settled, Wolsey all of a sudden, changing his usual strain, re∣presented to the king, that the expence of the garrison of Tournay greatly sur∣passed all the advantages he could derive from the possession of a place which was at such a distance from Calais; that it could not be maintained i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> case of a rupture between the two crowns. He therefore advised him to fill his coffers with the money which was offered by Francis; and embrace the proposal of the match, which would consolidate their friendship, render them the arbiters of Europe, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm a seasonable bulwark against the growing power of the house of Austria, already in possession of the empire, Spain, the Low Countries, and the kingdom of Naples and Sicily.

saw Wol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey was resolved to govern both himself and the king of France. In∣deed, the cardinal had made a merit of disclosing to the king the advances which the French monarch had made to him in private, observing, that the prince must be very desirous of Henry's friendship, who would sue so submis∣sively to his servants. Wolsey had gained such an ascendancy over the mind of his sovereign, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e could have persuaded him to follow any measure what∣soever, even though it had been opposite to his own interest: but, here his favou∣rite's inclination, and his own interest happened to coincide; and he accordingly a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ented to the proposal. The conditions of the alliance being regulated be∣tween the cardinal and M. de Villeroy secretary of state, who repaired to Lon∣don for that purpose, the king of France sent over a solemn emba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, composed of the admiral de Bonnivet, Stephen Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cher bishop of Paris, joined to Villeroy, and impowered to renew the treaty of friendship between the two kings; to treat of a league with the pope, and other princes of Christendom, for the de∣fence of religion, and the catholic church; of the match between the dauphin and the pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cess Mary; of the restitution of Tournay, St. Amand, and Mor∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gne; and of an interview between the two kings. They brought over letters patent, by which Francis obliged himself to pay to his Dear Friend the cardin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of York, a pension of ten thousand livres, in return for his giving up the administration of the bishopric of Tournay. All these articles being duly discussed, four separate treaties were signed and ratified in October. In the first, the contracting parties agreed, That the marriage should be celebrated when the dauphin should have attained the fourteenth year of his age: That Mary's portion should amount to three hundred and thirty thousa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d crowns of gold: and, That her jointure should be equal to that of Anne of Bret<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gne, and Mary of England, who had been wives to Lewis XII. The second related to the restitution of Tournay, for which Francis engaged to pay six hundred thousand crowns; but from this sum he was left at liberty to deduct the portion of the princess Mary. The third concerned certain precautions taken, to prevent an infraction of the peace, as well as to procure prompt reparation for the damage that might be sustained by the subjects of either power. And the fourth stipu∣lated an interview between the two monarchs, in the village of Sandenfelt, near Ar∣dres<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</NOTE> in Picardy.

<P>Wol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey was so intoxicated by this flow of prosperity, that his pride and arrogance surmounted all bounds.

He erected a new court of judicature, called, the Legate's court, in effect a court of conscience, that took cognizance of almost all the actions of life; and one John Allen being appointed judge of this bench, acted with incredible rapaciousness and extortion, on pretence of reforming the morals of the people. He pretended that his jurisdiction extended to all suits arising from wills, and contracts of marriage; and tried an infinite number of causes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

At the same time, the cardinal legate disposed of all the benefices of the kingdom in favour of his own creatures, without paying the least regard to the rights of churches, mona<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teries, or patrons. At length, the archbishop of Canterbury, from a mo∣tive of co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>science, informed the king of this oppression; and Henry not only <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemed surprized at the cardinal's insolence, but, desired <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he old bishop to tell him, that he expected he would re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose abuses.

But his agent, Allen, being afterwards accused by one John London, a simple priest, the complaint reached the ears of the king, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imanded the cardinal with such severity, that he was more circumspect in the sequel. The great wealth, power, and authority, which he enjoyed in England, could not satisfy his ambition, while there was one degree of ecclesiastical dignity which he had not yet attained. He had already begun to take measures for obtain∣ing the papacy, whenever the holy see should become vacant; and the king of France had assured him of the votes of fourteen cardinals: but, since Charles was elected emperor, he seemed to think that prince more capable of raising him to St. Peter's chair, and began gradually to wean his master from the in∣terest of France, and engage him in behalf of the house of Austria. Never∣theless he would not declare himself so far as to prevent the interview between Henry and Francis, because he could not prevail upon himself to resign the pleasure of appearing at the court of France, with all the pomp of ecclesi∣astical magnificence; and of shewing himself to his countrymen, honoured and caressed by such a powerful monarch. But he was resolved to take such mea∣sures as would hinder Francis from turning this interview to the prejudice of the emperor, who at this period gained an incredible accession of wealth by the prowess of Fernando Cortez, in his conquest of the Mexican empire. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

<P>Wolsey having regolated the ceremonial of the interview, the king repaired to Canterbury in the latter end of May, in order to pass his Whitsun∣tide<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1520.</NOTE> in that city, and from thence proceed to Calais; but next day he was given to understand that the emperor had landed at Dover. The whole court, and even the king himself, was surprized at the arrival of Charles, which had been preconcerted between that prince and the cardinal, to whom he had promised<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> his influence with the pope, towards procuring for him the bishopric of Baja∣dox. Wolsey was sent to compliment the emperor at Dover, where the king met him next day, and conducted him to Canterbury; whither also the queen came to visit her nephew, whom she had never seen before. The emperor's de∣sign in this voyage was to divert Henry from his purposed interview with Francis, from which, however, the king of England thought he could not recede with honour; but, in all probability, he gained over Wolsey entirely to his interest, by promising to support his designs upon the papacy; and Henry assured him that he would never engage with the French king in any measure that should be prejudicial to his imperial majesty. After having been magnificently entertained during the holidays, he took leave of his aunt Catherine and Henry, and embarked at Sandwich for Flanders, very well sa∣tisfied with the success of his visit. That same day the king of England sailed from Dover for Calais; and, on the fourth day of June, he removed with his own queen, the queen dowager of France, and all his retinue, to a su∣perb wooden house, erected near the place of interview: it was furnished in the most ostentatious manner, and from the chappel there was a private gallery, that reached to the strong castle of Guisnes. The house, which Francis pitched near Ardres, was rather large than sumptuous; for he had intended to lodge in a pavilion of cloth of gold, which was blown down by the wind: so that he was obliged to build a wooden edifice in a hurry. Before the two monarchs met, cardinal Wolsey waited upon the French king with some proposals touching the late alliance; and, after some conferences, Francis agreed that when the
<PB N="558" REF="5680"/>
million of crowns, stipulated in the last treaty, should be liquidated, he should continue to pay to the king of England an annual pension of one hundred thousand livres; that, in case of the dauphin's becoming king of England by his marriage with the princess Mary, this pension should be continued to her and his heirs for ever; and that the differences between England and Scotland should be referred to the arbitration of Louisa of Savoy, mother to the king of France, and cardinal Wolsey. On the seventh day of June the two kings met on horseback, in the valley of Arden, where they alighted; and, after mu∣tual salutation, walked arm in arm into a rich tent, pitched for their accom∣modation. On Monday the eleventh day of the month, the justs and tourna∣ments began in sight of the ladies, for whom scaffolds were erected. Both kings entered the lists, and behaved with great dexterity; though Henry bore away the honour of the field. He ran a tilt against monsieur de Grandeville, whom he disabled at the second encounter. He engaged monsieur de Montmo∣rency, whom, however, he could not unhorse. He fought at faulchion with a French nobleman, who presented him with his horse, in token of submis∣sion; he disarmed monsieur de Fleurange; and signalized himself above all others in throwing the javelin, wielding the sword and target, and fighting with the two handed sword, an exercise at which Francis was likewise very ex∣pert. This monarch, probably, thought he should find his account in grati∣fying Henry's vanity, by allowing him to enjoy this petty preheminence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polvd. Verg. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll. Herbert.</NOTE> These exercises being finished, the two kings regaled each other with feasting, balls, masquerades, and mutual presents. They seemed to vye with each other in splendour and magnificence; insomuch that the place of this interview was stiled, The field of cloth of gold. At length they parted on the twenty∣fourth day of June; and Henry, with his train, returned to Calais. On the tenth of July the king returned the emperor's compliment, by visiting him and his aunt Margaret at Gravelines; and next day they accompanied him back to Calais, where they were royally entertained. Francis was greatly alarmed at these reciprocal visits: and his jealousy was not without foundation; for, on this occasion, they, in all probability, projected the alliance which was conclud∣ed in the sequel. In the mean time Henry sailed with the first fair wind for England, where he and his retinue arrived in safety; and Charles repaired to Aix-la-Chapelie, where he was solemnly crowned emperor on the twenty-first day of October.</P>

<P>Luther's doctrine having by this time gained ground in almost every district of Germany, pope Leo, after having in vain attempted to soothe him with promises, and intimidate him with threats, at length published a bull of excommunication against him and all his adherents. Luther appealed from this sentence to a general council, and set his holiness at defiance. Then the pope endeavoured to persuade the elector of Saxony to put him to death, or send him to Rome; but, that prince refusing to comply with his request, the papal nuncio ordered Luther's books to be publicly burned at Cologne; and Luther, in revenge, committed the body of the canon law to the flames at Wirtemberg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and published a book to justify his conduct. He was supported by the elector of Saxony, who passionately desired to see a reformation in the church: he was seconded in his endeavours by Ulricus, Zuinglius, and Phi∣lip Melancthon, a man of equal piety and learning; and he was encouraged to
<PB N="559" REF="5690"/>
persevere by Erasmus, who assured him he had ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y favourers in England and the Low Countries; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xhorted him to proceed with modesty and cir∣cumspection. The emperor, after his coronation, assembled a diet at Worms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Every zealous<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleidan.</NOTE> papist drew his pen against this performer; and, among the rest, Henry king of England declared himself a champion of the Roman church. He was par∣ticularly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert.</NOTE> ince<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed against Luther for the liberties he had taken with Thomas Aquinas, an author in great request both with the king and the cardinal. Thus animated, he composed a book De Septem Sacramentis, in which he strenuously opposed Luther in the article of indulgences, the number of sacra∣ments, and the papal authority. This performance was presented by John Clarke, dean of Windsor, in full consistory, to the pope, who received it with great solemnity of applause; and, with the unanimous consent of the college of cardinals, issued a bull, in which he bestowed upon Henry the honourable title of Fidei Defensor, or, Defender of the Faith.</P>

<P>The emperor and the king of France were so jealous of each other, that they wanted nothing but a pretext for commencing hostilities. Francis, therefore, on pretence of his rival's having infringed the treaty of Noyon, sent an army into Navarre, under the command of Lesparre of the house of Foix; who, finding that kingdom almost wholly destitute of troops, reduced it in the space of fifteen days. Elevated with this success, he entered Spain, and laid siege to Logrogno, in the province of Guipuscoa. The Spaniards, though divided into factions, were so alarmed at this invasion, that they united for their common safety. Having assembled a numerous army, they defeated and took the French general, and recovered Navarre in less time than Lesparre had spent in the conquest of that kingdom. Francis, not contented with this at∣tack, spirited up a new enemy against Charles, in the person of Robert de la Marck, prince of Sedan, and sovereign of Bouillon; who, thinking himself injured by the emperor, sent him a message of defiance; and, putting himself at the head of five thousand men, whom he had e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted in France, invested Vireton, a place in the province of Luxembourg. Charles immediately sum∣moned the king of England to his assistance, according to the stipulations of the league of London; and Henry, influenced by the cardinal, was glad of this opportunity to lay the blame of the repture upon Francis. He forthwith sent an ambassador to that prince, requiring him to desist from all hostilities against the emperor, not only in Luxembourg, but likewise in Navarre; and Francis thought proper to comply with his demand, rather than furnish Henry with a colour to declare for his rival. The French king had already concluded a league with the pope for conquering and dividing between them the king∣dom of Naples; but, Francis distrusting Leo's sincerity, and procrastinating the ratification of this treaty, the pope suspected him in his turn, and privately engaged in a league with the emperor for driving the French out of the Mila∣nese, and restoring that dutchy to Francis Sforza. The pope enlisted six thou∣sand<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> Swiss in his service, and augmented his forces on various pretences. The emperor ordered the viceroy of Naples to hold the troops of that kingdom

ready to march at the first notice; and Prosper Colonna was declared general of the league. Before they declared themselves openly, they made unsuccess∣ful attempts to surprize Geno<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Milan, and Como; and, the suspicion of Francis being a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> length aroused, he levied twenty thousand Swiss, and sent them to Milan under the command of Lautrec. By this time Prosper Colonna, having assembled his forces, invested Parma; but was obliged to raise the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ege by Lautrec, who pursued him beyond the boundaries of the Milanese; and, supposing he had nothing further to fear from his efforts, withdrew L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scun with his garrison from Parma.

<P>The French, in all likelihood, would have been entirely expelled from Italy before the end of the campaign, had not the progress of the allies been stopped by the death of pope Leo, who is said to have died of excess of joy, at the success of the league. The news of his decease no sooner reached the army than the troops which he had enlisted dispersed; and the Flore<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tines returned to their own country: the duke of Ferrara recovered some of his pla∣ces in the Romagna; and Francis Maria de la Rovera retrieved the dutchy of Urbino.

The emperor, not contented with having hum∣bled Robert de la Marck, assembled a numerous army, and bestowed the com∣mand of it upon the count de Na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>au, who approaching Champagne, Francis represented to the king of England that he could no longer forbear taking arms in his own defence, as Charles certainly intended to invade his dominions.

<P>On the fourth day of August the conferences were opened <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, where the cardinal appeared with all the pomp of a sovereign, in qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity of Henry's lieu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nant, possessed of the great seal of England, and vested with ample power to terminate the quarrel between the two parties; to renew <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he alliance between France and England; and conclude any other league that<NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.</NOTE> should be for his master's interest.

<P>Wolsey, after some feigned endeavours to find out other expedi∣ents for a pacification, repaired to Bruges, where he concluded a league between Henry and the emperor against France, by which the king of England obliged himself, to attack Francis with an army of forty thousand men; and to bestow upon Charles the princess Mary, who had already been betrothed to the dau∣phin. Thus, Henry declared himself the enemy of Francis, without the least provocation; and, contrary to all the rules of sound policy, considering the vast power of the emperor, which it was his interest to ballance. But, this step was like all the rest of his conduct, suggested by cardinal Wol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey, whose heart was set upon the papacy, which he hoped to obtain by the influence of Charles, who had already procured for him the bishopric of Palencia in Castile, with the administration of the see of Badajox. His legation was protracted for two years; and Leo before his death had issued a bull, impowering him to create fifty knights, as many counts palatine, the like number of acolytes and chap∣lains, and forty apostolical notaries: to legitimate bastards, grant the doctor's degree in all the faculties, as well as all sorts of dispensations: nay, to all the honours, wealth, and power he already possessed, he this year received the ad∣dition of the rich abbey of St. Alban's in commendam. No wonder that a prelate of his ambition, thus forwarded by every gale of prosperity, should aspire at the highest dignity of the church. He is even said, to have been so impatient to possess St. Peter's chair, that he was concerned in abridging the days of Leo by poison. Be that as it may, he was certainly so arrogant as to affect con∣tempt for the nobility of the kingdom; and so vindictive, that the most power∣ful peer in England could not disoblige him with impuity.</P>

He was taxed with having frequently con∣sulted Hopkins the monk, touching the succession of the crown, as well as with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving affected popularity; with having declared to Knevit, that if he were ill used he would execute against Henry the scheme which his father had project∣ed against Richard III. whom that nobleman meaned to have assassinated with a kni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, had he been admitted into his presence; and with having said to lord Abergavenny, that should the king die he would assume the rule of the realm, in spite of all opposition; adding, that should the lord Abergavenny disclose his purpose, be would call him to account in single combat. He was tried by one duke, one marquis, seven earls, and twelve barons, before the duke of Norfolk, appointed high steward for the occasion. When he heard the indictment read, he said, it was a false, forged conspiracy: neverthele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, he was convicted upon the evidence of Knevit, Hopkins, and two others; and condemned to die the death of a traitor.

against the French king, for allowing the duke of Albany to r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>turn to Scot∣land from France, where he had been detained for some years at the request of the English monarch, that he might intermeddle the more successfully in the Scottish affairs during the absence of the regent. Besides, he imagined the duke intended to marry his sister, the queen dowager of Scotland, because she had sued for a divorce from her husband the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of Angus; and the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of Albany had supported her suit a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the court of Rome. Notwithstanding the pains which the regent took to clear himself of this suspicion, by assuring Hen∣ry he had no such intention; and t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at his own wife was alive, the king of England wrote a letter to the Scot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> parliament, accusing the duke of a design upon the crown, to the prejudice of the lawful sovereign; and desiring them to expel him from the realm. To this charge they answered, That he had been misinformed touching the designs of the duke of Albany, which were up∣right and honourable: that he himself had acted against the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>terests of his own nephew in somenting disturbances in his kingdom: and, that if he was not in∣clined to renew the truce with the regent, they would e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deavour to defend their country from his attacks. When he received this answer, together with a let∣ter from his sister, reproaching him for his sinister designs upon her son James, he ordered the lord Dacres to march with five hundred men to the borders of Scotland, and proclaim, that the Scottish parliament should make peace with him within a certain time at their peril. His aim was to furnish his own party in that kingdom with a pretence for refusing to serve the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gent, should he at∣tempt to make a diversion in favour of Francis. So far the expedient succeeded. The duke of Albany having raised an army to make an irruption into England, they no sooner approached the frontiers, than many lords of di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inction refused to proceed, declaring they would not involve their country in an unnecessary war with England.

Henry affirmed, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

In order to maintain this war, which was altogether unjust and impolitic, the king, by the advice of the cardinal, issued warrants to all sheriffs and constables, to number the people from the age of sixteen upwards, and specify the effects of each indi∣vidual, that he might borrow a tenth of the laity, and a fourth of the clergy, besides twenty thousand pounds, which he exacted by way of loan from the city of London. This dangerous ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edient produced great clamours among the people, who loudly exclaimed ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst Wolsey as the author of the imposition; and the London merchants absolutely refused to specify the value of their ef∣fects,

<P>Wolsey was not so chagrined at this miscarriage, as at his disap∣pointment with respect to the papacy. Though the emperor had promised to support his pretensions with all his interest, he had no intention to keep his word. He wanted to have a pope who should be wholly devoted to his interest; and he knew Wolsey too well, to think he should be able to govern such a pon∣tiff: he therefore resolved to promote his own preceptor cardinal Adrian Flo∣rentius, a native of Utrecht, to the papacy; and to conduct his election in such a manner, that he should not run the risque of forseiting the friendship of Wol∣sey, who had reminded him of his promise; and sent Richard Pace to manage his interest at Rome, immediately after the decease of Leo. Charles took his measures on this occasion with such art and address, that Adrian was unani∣mously chosen pope in the conclave, without the emperor's appearing to inter∣meddle<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dini.</NOTE> in the affair. The very choice, however, of this person, plainly pointed out the director of the election; and doubtless, Wolsey must have been equal∣ly mortified and incensed against Charles; tho' he thought proper to suppress his resentment, in hope of being able to profit by the emperor's friendship on some future occasion, as the new pontiff Adrian VI. was old and infirm. On the other hand, Charles found it necessary to keep up a friendly correspondence with the English cardinal, well knowing it intirely depended on that prelate, whe∣ther or not he should live on amicable terms with Henry. It was therefore with a view to cultivate this friendship, that the emperor in his voyage to Spain, touched on the twenty-sixth day of May at Dover, where he found the cardinal waiting for him with a magnificent retinue; and Henry in person, repairing to the same place, conducted him to Greenwich. From thence they went toge∣ther to London, where they were entertained with great splendor, the cardinal celebrating mass before them, with all the pomp of a sovereign pontiff: then the king invited Charles to Windsor, where he was installed in the order of the garter, to which his brother Ferdinand had likewise been admitted.</P>

<P>After this ceremony, the two monarchs conferred together upon more important subjects, and ratified the treaty of Bruges in the most solemn manner. In the preamble, Henry declared himself absolved of all obligations to Francis, who had begun the war against the emperor; and sent the duke of Albany into Scotland, contrary to his engagements. The contracting parties agreed, That Charles should espouse the princess Mary, as soon as she should have attained the twelfth year of her age; and receive as her portion four hun∣dred thousand crowns, from which, however, Henry should deduct what he had lent to Maximilian: That if either party should recede from this contract of marriage, he should pay four hundred thousand crowns to the other: That by a certain limited time, the emperor should invade France on the side of Spain with an army of forty thousand men, while the king of England should enter Picardy with the like number: That neither peace nor truce should be concluded without their mutual consent: That the conquests made in France should belong to him who had the best pretensions to the conquered places;
<PB N="565" REF="5750"/>
and, That in order to avoid all dispute on this subject, they should declare their separate pretensions before the beginning of the campaign: That the two powers should assist each other reciprocally, in case the king of England might be inclined to subdue Scotland, or reduce Ireland to implicit obedience; or the emperor be disposed to recover Guelderland or Friesland; and in case England should be attacked by the Scots, or Flanders by the duke of Guelderland: That they should submit to the spiritual jurisdiction of the cardinal of York, as pope's legate, and require him to pronounce the sentence of excommunication against that prince who should first violate the treaty, which in the mean time should be concealed from the knowledge of the common enemy: That the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

This league being signed and confirmed, Charles obliged himself by letters patent, to make up to Henry the sums that were due to him from Francis, in case that prince should, on account of this al∣liance, refuse to continue the payments to which he had bound himself by treaty. The emperor likewise engaged to pay to Wolsey the pension of twelve thousand livres, which he had received from Francis in lieu of the bishopric of Tournay, besides an annuity of two thousand five hundred ducats, in the room of what he drew from the see of Badajox. But these liberalities of the empe∣ror were amply recompensed by a large sum which he borrowed of Henry before his departure.</P>

<P>During the five weeks he spent in England, he won the affection of the whole court by his affability and presents; and recommended himself strongly to the nation in general, by appointing the earl of Surry admiral of his fleet. While he resided at London, that nobleman, who commanded the joint fleets of England and Flanders, made two descents upon the coast of France, from whence he carried off considerable booty; and afterwards con∣voyed the emperor to Spain. On his return from this expedition, he was sent over to Calais with a body of forces, to join the count de Bure, the imperial general; and these having ravaged part of Picardy, undertook the siege of Hes∣din, which, however, they could not reduce. Then they attacked Dourlens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert.</NOTE> which they took and burned, together with Marquise, and some other places of little importance; but, the winter approaching, and dissension prevailing between the generals, the earl of Surry withdrew his troops to Calais, and re∣turned to England.

Having carried his point in the convocation, he harangued the house of commons upon the injuries which the king had suffered at the hands of Francis, the necessity of engaging in a war with that monarch; and concluded with asking one fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of all lay effects, payable in four years. This extraordinary demand, tho' inforced by Sir Thomas Moo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the speaker, met with great opposition; yet after ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinate debates, the commons agreed, That every man possessed of twenty pounds and upwards, of yearly rent, should pay two shillings in the pound; and the rest possessing above two pounds, should give one shilling in the pound: all under that sum, and above the age of sixteen, were taxed at four pence a-head, to be payed in two years. The cardinal, incensed at their re∣jecting his proposal, repaired to the house, and desired to hear their reasons for refusing his demands; but, they gave him to understand, that they never ar∣gued in presence of strangers: and he thought proper to retire, extremely mor∣tified at his repulse.

<P>With respect to the campaign in Picardy, the king of England sent an army of six hundred demilances, two hundred archers on horseback, three thousand on foot, five thousand billmen, and half that number of pioneers, to Calais, under the command of the duke of Suffolk, who dr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ughted as an addition seventeen hundred soldiers from that garrison; and with these he made an irruption into the enemy's country. On the twentieth day of September he was joined by the count de Bure, with such a number of men as formed, together with the English, about twenty thousand. Thus reinforced, the duke coasted the river Soam, and besieged Bray, which he took by assault; then, passing the river, he made himself master of Roye and Montdidier; and, in a word, advanced within eleven leagues of Paris, without meeting with the least opposition, except in a small skirmish with a body of French, commanded by monsieur de Pontdormy, who escaped with great difficulty. Francis, ex∣tremely alarmed at their progress, detached from Lyon the duke de Vendome, with all the troops he could assemble for the defence of his capital; and, the winter approaching with great severity, the allies thought proper to retire, tho' they took Bouchain in their retreat; nevertheless, all the places they had gar∣risoned were immediately retaken by the French general.

Francis now took possession of Milan without opposition, and undertook the siege of Pavia in the beginning of November. By this time he had detached the Venetians and Florentines from the interest of Charles; and now he engaged in a secret treaty with the pope, who obliged himself to grant a free passage to his troops, destined for the conquest of Naples. He accordingly in the spring sent thither a detachment of five or six thousand men, under the command of the duke of Albany, who had then quitted Scotland; and though the pope feigned to op∣pose them at first, he admitted them into the heart of his dominions, and then published his accommodation with the French king as the effect of compulsion.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> The emperor, notwithstanding his natural phlegm, was incensed at the defec∣tion of his holiness, and even threatened revenge; tho' Clement's league with Francis, in a great measure, contributed to the success of the Imperial arms, as it induced Francis to divide his forces and weaken his army.</P>

<P>Mean while the court of England seemed to adopt new maxims. Henry made no diversion in Picardy; he discontinued the payment of the subsidy he had granted to the duke of Bourbon; and even demanded reimbursement of the money he had lent to the emperor at his departure from England. Charles was alarmed at these concurring circumstances, which seemed to indicate an alienation in Henry; and his suspicion was confirmed when he received intelligence from his ambassador in England, that a person, sent by the dutchess of Angouleme, regent of France, had long and frequent conferences with cardinal Wolsey. He no longer doubted that this vindictive prelate, whom he had twice disobliged in the affair of the papacy, would per∣suade the king of England to abandon his cause, and engage in a league with his enemy. He foresaw that the cardinal would be seconded in his endeavours by the pope, who now payed great respect to the court of England. He con∣firmed the title of Fidei Defensor, which the king had obtained from Leo; at the desire of Wolsey, he suppressed the monastery of St. Frideswide in Ox∣ford, on which spot the cardinal intended to found a college, and endow it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</NOTE> with the revenues of the convent. He, in the course of this same year, issued another bull, impowering the cardinal to suppress as many monasteries as he should think proper, to raise the yearly rent of three thousand ducats for the same purpose; and, in the month of December, he, with the king's consent, appointed cardinal Laurentius Campegius, bishop of Salisbury.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1525.</NOTE> The French king still persisted in carrying on the siege of Pavia, though his operations were very much impeded by the rigour of the season; and his convoys were greatly interrupted by the Imperial army, which had taken post at Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ano. At length the duke of Bourbon, who had gone to Germany for a reinforcement, arrived with eleven thousand men, an addition which ren∣dered the Imperialists more numerous than the French; and, on the twenty∣fifth day of February, he attacked the camp of Francis, who was totally routed, and taken prisoner. This unexpected event produced great alteration in the politics of the European princes. The kingdom of France was overwhelmed with consternation, and must have been totally ruined, if the emperor had fol∣lowed his blow, and the king of England acted in Picardy. But Charles was now become so formidable, that the other princes began to deliberate upon the
<PB N="541" REF="5810"/>
formation of a league to counterpoise his greatness. The Venetians, in parti∣cular, no sooner were informed of the battle of Pavia, than they proposed such an alliance to the pope. But he preferred his own interest to the pub∣lic cause, and concluded a separate treaty with the viceroy of Naples, who acted in the name of the emperor. Mean while Charles affected to receive the ti∣dings of his victory with great moderation; and even pretended to sympathize with the misfortunes of Francis, who was conveyed to Spain, and committed close prisoner to the castle of Madrid; not but that he had already proposed conditions of peace to Francis, which that monarch rejected as oppressive and dishonourable. His sister, the dutchess of Alençon, arrived at the place of his confinement, with full powers from her mother the regent, to negotiate a peace; but the emperor insisted upon such terms as were judged unreasonable, and the captive king delivered to his sister a writing signed with his own hand; by which he ordered the states of France to crown his son the dauphin. The parliament of Paris, however, did not think this mandate, which was called the edict of Madrid, a sufficient authority to contravene the laws of the realm, in an affair of such importance. Charles, at bottom, was void of generosity, integrity, and compassion. He inherited the phlegm of Maximilian, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Du Bellay.</NOTE> fraud of Ferdinand. He amused Francis with a vague negotiation, and refu∣sed to ratify the treaty which his viceroy had concluded with the pope. Though he re-admitted Sforza into the possession of Milan, according to his sti∣pulations with the allies, he, by means of his general in Italy, seduced him into a conspiracy which afforded a pretence for depriving him of his dominions. The Venetians, who were resolved to hazard every thing rather than this dutchy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> should remain in the emperor's hands, told his ambassador, who pressed them to re-unite with his master, that the re-establishment of Sforza was a previous step, without which they would never enter into his measures. The pope did not act with the same spirit and fortitude; for, while be seemed to listen with pleasure to the proposals of Venice, touching a general league against the house of Austria, he maintained a legate in Spain, to treat of a separate alliance. As this, however, was protracted until he began to despair of its being brought to perfection, he fixed a day for signing the league with France and the Vene∣tians; but, in this interval, he received intelligence of the treaty's being con∣cluded at Madrid, and then retracted his promise to those two powers. When the treaty arrived, he found it couched in terms so dark and ambiguous, that he began to perceive he had been duped, and refused to ratify such an equi∣vocal engagement. The Spanish ambassador affirmed, that those ambiguities<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> were undesigned, and in order to gain time, desired he would draw up another according to his own judgment; engaging that in two months it should be signed by the emperor.</P>

<P>The friendship between Charles and the king of England seemed to be on the wane even before the battle of Pavia. Though the princeis Mary was betrothed to the emperor, her father offered her in marriage to the king of Scotland; and, on the other hand, the emperor made no scruple to conclude his marriage with Isabella of Portugal, notwithstanding his engagement to the English princess. Nevertheless, in the month of March he had sent the lord of Bure and the president of the council of Mechlin into England, to demand
<PB N="572" REF="5820"/>
that the princess and her portion should be sent to him without delay; and that Henry should, according to his engagement, enter Picardy with a powerful army. Not but that Charles had real cause to complain. The king of England had promised to furnish one hundred thousand crowns a month, towards the duke of Bourbon's expedition into France; but, after the first payment, he put a stop to this sobs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy. At the same time he demanded reimbursement of the sums he had l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t the emperor, when he knew that prince was in no con∣dition to comply with his demand. Before the ambassadors of Charles received their answer at the court of London, the news of the battle of Pavia, and the captivity of Francis, arrived in England, in a letter from the gouveruante of Flanders; and though this account was by no means agreeable to Henry, he dissembled his sentiments so far as to order a solemn Te Deum to be celebrated at St. Paul's, he himself ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ling in person at the ceremony. In a few days after the arrival of these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dings he assembled his council to deliberate upon the po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure of affairs in Europe; and the debates turned upon this question: Whether the king should seize this opportunity to make conquests in France, and avail himself of his right to that kingdom; or succour France with a view to countexpoise the exorbitant power of the empetor? The inclinations of the king and cardinal, which at this time happened to coincide with the dictates of found policy, determined the council in favour of the captive king: and now nothing was wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing but a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e to justify a rupture with the emperor.</P>

<P>Henry forth with dispatched Cuthbert Tonstal, bishop of London, and Sir Robert Wingfield, as his ambassadors, into Spain, to represent to the emperor, that as the war had been carried on at the common expence, it was but reasonable that the king of England should reap some advantage from the victory of Pavis. He therefore desired, that in the treaty with the captive king, which was on the carpet, it might be stipulated, that he should be put in pos∣session of what properly belonged to him in France. If this justice could not be ob∣tained by fair means, he demanded, the emperor, in pursuance of his treaty with Henry, should invade France on the side of Spain, while the English should act in Picardy; and that the war should not be discontinued until the English monarch should have received full satisfaction. He likewise observed that the contracting parties of the treaty of Windsor had mutually engaged to deliver the prisoners to him of the two whose dominions those prisoners should appear to have usurped; he, therefore, required Charles to give up the captive king to the English ambassadors, as soon as he himself should receive the princess Mary, to whom he was contracted. Henry knew that he could not fulfil his engage∣ment with his daughter, because he had already resolved upon a marriage with Isa∣bella of Portugal; and that he would not act so diametrically opposite to his own interest, as to give up a prisoner of such consequence: accordingly the em∣peror answered in vague and general terms, such as implied a refusal. Then<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert.

<P>Henry in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted the management of this, as of every other af∣fair, to Wolsey; and tho' his friendship was of such importance to France, that he might have sold it at a very high price, he would take no advantage of the distresses of its king; all he demanded was security for the sums legally due to him from that monarch. All the articles being adjusted, five separate treaties were signed at Moore, on the thirtieth day of August. The first contained a league offensive and defensive between France and England, comprehending the allies of both kings. The second related to the payment of the sums due to Henry by the king of France, as specified in several successive treaties. In lieu of these, the regent engaged in her son's name, to pay two millions of crowns of gold, at different installments; and that, in case of Henry's dying before the debt should be liquidated, the remainder should be made good to his heirs and suc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s: whereas, should he survive the entire payment of the sum, he should afterward<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> receive a pension of one hundred thousand crowns for life.

The fourth imported, that the king of Scot∣land should not be deemed as an ally of France, included in this agreement, provided the Scots should commit any act of hostility against England after the twenty-fifth day of December. In the fifth treaty, the court of France promised, that it would not directly nor indirectly, consent to the return of the duke of Albany to Scotland during the minority of James V. All these treaties<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> were rati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied upon oath, by the regent of France, approved by the parliaments of Paris, Tholouse, and Bourdeaux; the noblemen and cities obliged themselves by letters patent to observe them; and Francis I. sent a ratification of them under his own hand, in a writing dated on the twenty-seventh day of December. Nor did the regent of France forget the good offices of cardinal Wolsey on this occasion.

name, what the subjects refused to give under that of a decree or commis∣sion; for, certain sums were demanded at the king's pleasure; so that the bene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>volence was equivalent to a grievous taxation. The magistrates of London refused to comply with the imposition, alledging, that the expedient of bene∣volence had been abolished by Richard III. The cardinal replied, that Richard was a tyrant and usurper, whose laws ought to have no effect upon the prero∣gative. He tampered in secret with the mayor and aldermen; yet, before he could either cajole or intimidate them into a compliance, an insurrection hap∣pened in the neighbourhood of London; but, the insurgents were soon quelled, and some of them committed to prison. The king thinking it necessary to de∣monstrate, that he had no intention to oppress the people, declared in council, that no person should be punished for this insurrection; and the prisoners were discharged, after having appeared at the council-board, and been severely re∣buked for their insolence. The cardinal affected to become bound for their future good behaviour; and endeavoured to justify his conduct, by saying, he had done nothing but by the advice of the judges. It was no sooner known, that the king did not approve of all the cardinal's proceedings, than a great num∣ber of complaints was exhibited against that prelate. Allen his chaplain, and in∣strument of oppression, was so vigorously prosecuted in a court of judicature, for his extortion, that the affair became the subject of general conversation; and at length reached the ears of Henry, who took some pains to inform himself of the particulars. In the course of this inquiry, he obtained a full view of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll. Hollingshed.</NOTE> unpopular side of Wolsey's administration; and was so incensed, that he had well nigh divested that minister of his favour and employments. Ignorant as he was of the cardinal's oppressive conduct, he had imagined the people thought themselves extremely happy under his mild government; but, now he was disabused, and gave way to the transports of his choler, which the minister could not appease without the most abject submissions. He produced his will, in which he had bequeathed all his riches to the king; and at length, found means to persuade him, that all the excesses he had committed in the exercise of his authority, were owing to his desire of augmenting his majesty's inheri∣tance. This storm was no sooner overblown, than he removed from the king's ear all those whom he suspected of disaffection to his interest; and the palace of Hampton-Court being just finished at his expence, he presented it to his master, who gave him Richmond in exchange, together with the warmest assurances of unint<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrupted affection. About this period the king created his natural son Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond and Somerset, earl of Nottingham, lieu∣tenant-general beyond the Trent, warden of the borders, and afterwards, ad∣miral of England, though he was but six years of age. Having no legitimate son, he expressed the utmost tenderness for this child, who was the fruit of an amour with Mrs. Elizabeth Blount, a young lady of extraordinary<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

In the beginning of this year, the government of Scotland, which since the departure of the duke of Albany, remained in the hands ofthe earl of Angus, sent the earl of Cassils with other ambassadors into England, to treat of the marriage between their young king and the princess Mary, a match with which Henry had for some time amused the Scottish administration. As divers difficulties occurred, the truce between the two nations was prolonged
<PB N="575" REF="5870"/>
from January to March, that the earl might have time to return to his own country for fresh instructions; but as Henry was never in earnest upon this subject, the negotiation produced no effect.</P>

<P>The league of Moore inspired the regent of France with fresh cou∣rage, and in a great measure, influenced the conduct of the pope and Venetians: the emperor recalled his ambassadors from England; and in a little time concluded his marriage with Isabella of Portugal. The pope finding himself still duped by Charles, gave him to understand, that no peace was to be expected without the re-establishment of Sforza in the Milanese; and indeed, he was now on the eve of a war, in which he would have been unable to cope with such a number of powerful antagonists. This consideration cost him great un∣easiness<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. An. 1526.</NOTE> and perplexity, from which however he was soon relieved by the im∣patience of Francis, who growing more and more tired of confinement, gave up the great point, which had hitherto retarded the pacification. This was the dutchy of Burgundy, and the supremacy of Flanders and Artois, which, by the treaty of Madrid, he ceded to the emperor, obliging himself moreover, to marry that prince's sister Eleonora: to renounce his pretensions to Naples, Mi∣lan, Genoa, Ath, Tournay, Lisle, and Hesdin: to persuade Henry D'Albret to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

He likewise promised, upon the faith and word of a king, that he would either ratify the treaty in France, or return to the place of his confinement. On these conditions, he was set at liberty, and conducted to the frontiers of Spain by Lannoy, viceroy of Naples, who attended him to Bourdeaux; and pressed him to perform his promise. His first care was to ratify the treaty of Moore, concluded with the king of England; but, that of Ma∣drid, he renounced as the effect of compulsion. Nevertheless, he offered to pay two millions of crowns in lieu of the dutchy of Burgundy, which he raid, he could not alienate; and to perform every other article of the engage∣ment. This proposal was rejected by Charles, who hoped he would one day be glad to retrieve his children, who were hostages, by a literal execution of the treaty.</P>

<P>Mean while, the ambassadors of the pope and the Venetians, waited upon Francis at Cognac, where the three powers concluded a league against the emperor, in which the duke of Milan was comprehended. His holiness and the republic of Venice, depending upon the assistance of France and England, sent an army into the field under the command of the duke D'Urbino, who suffered the castle of Milan to be taken by the Imperialists, miscarried in an attempt upon Genoa, and acted with great indifference in the cause of his constituents. Mean while, the duke de Sesso the Spanish am∣bassador at Rome, and Hugh de Moncada, who commanded the imperial<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.</NOTE> troops in the kingdom of Naples, instigated the Colonnae against the pope;
<PB N="576" REF="5880"/>
and they entered the city of Rome by surprize, at the head of six thousand<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> men. Clement was so terrified at this unexpected assau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, that he took shelter in the castle of St. Angelo; and was obliged to conclude a truce for four months with the emperor, before he could be rid of such troublesome guests. He and the Venetians expected, that in consequence of the treaty of Cognac, the king of France and England would act vigorously against Charles; but now they found themselves duped by the French king, whose sole view in concluding and publishing the treaty, was to intimidate the emperor into a compliance with his proposal. Even after the pope and Venetians had declared war against Charles, he sent the archbishop of Bourdeaux to repeat the offer of two mil∣lions<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> for Burgundy, which the emperor rejected with disdain, desiring the ambassador would tell his master, he had acted basely and wickedly; and that he ought not to have forgot the last conversation that passed between them at Madrid. His affairs had lately resumed a more favourable aspect in Italy; the baron de Frond<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perg had marched thither, at the head of forty thousand men raised in Germany; and Lannoy had arrived at Naples with a body of Spanish troops. Clement, and the Venecians, exhausted all their art and eloquence to engage the king of England in the league of Cognac: they tried to flatter his vanity with the title of Protector, hoping, that he would as formerly squander away his wealth for the interest of his neighbours; but, time and experience had ripened his understanding, and the treasure left by his father was already expended: he was loth to forego the tranquillity which he enjoyed; and his favourite was wholly ingrossed with the foundation of his college at<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> Oxford. Nevertheless, Henry being informed of the pope's necessities, which in all probability, might oblige him to make peace with the emperor, furnished him with thirty thousand ducats, which enabled him to maintain his forces under the duke D'Urbino; although, at the same time, he continued to treat of a separate peace with the viceroy of Naples. His maxim was to have always two strings to his bow; but, on this occasion he refined too much in his politics.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> The duke of Bourbon being in want of money for the subsis∣tence of his troops, left seven thousand Germans in Milan, under the command of Antonio de Leyva, and joined Frondsperg in the Plaisantin, while the vice∣roy of Naples marched with his Spaniards to the frontiers of the ecclesiastical state, in order to make a diversion, and oblige the pope to recal his troops un∣der the duke D'Urbino. Clement, being apprized of Bourbon's march, con∣cluded a truce for eight months with the viceroy, obliging himself to pay a certain sum to the duke of Bourbon; and then disbanded the greatest part of his army, before he knew the sentiments of the duke himself, who was in full march to Bologna. That prince refused to ratify the truce, because the sum stipulated was not sufficient for the payment of his forces; so that an∣other agreement was made; and the pope dismissed all the rest of his soldiers, that he might not be incumbered with an unnecessary expence. Notwith∣standing this convention, the duke of Bourbon suddenly began his march for Rome, which was immediately filled with consternation. Renzo de Ceri, in this emergency, undertook to raise an army within the city, that should defend it against all insults; and Clement trusting to his promise, took no
<PB N="577" REF="5890"/>
other measures for his own personal safety. The duke of Bourbon arriving in the neighbourhood, pretended his route was to Naples; and sent a trumpet to the pope, to demand a passage through the city. This being refused, he next morning approached by favour of a thick fog; and ordered his army to storm a breach, which the Romans had not found time to repair. In the beginning of the attack he was killed by a musket-shot; but, the prince of Orange order∣ing a cloak to be thrown over his body, continued the assault until the breach was forced; and the Imperialists made a lodgment in the suburbs. Then the pope retired to the castle of St. Angelo, with thirteen cardinals, some foreign am∣bassadors, and several persons of distinction. Mean while, the German troops sacked the city, and committed terrible outrages. The army of the allies, un∣der<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> the duke D'Urbino, arrived in the neighbourhood, but retired without having made the least attempt for the relief of his holiness, who finding him∣self in danger of being starved, capitulated with the prince of Orange; and was put into the custody of Alarcon, who had guarded Francis in his capti∣vity. This confinement of the pope was advantageous to several princes and states of Italy. The duke of Ferrara made himself master of Modena; the Venetians seized Ravenna and Servia; Sigismund Malatesta surprized Rimi∣ni; and the Florentines recovered their liberty, after having expelled the pope's legate.</P>

<P>Had the Imperial army proceeded immediately to reduce Bo∣logna, and the towns of Romagna, the emperor would have been rendered in∣vincible in Italy; but, they were so eager after plunder, that they neglected their master's affairs; and allowed Francis to send troops over the Alps, in order to stop their progress. That monarch had at length prevailed upon the king of England, to engage with him in a league offensive and defensive against Charles. Henry had sent Sir William Fitzwilliams to France, in order to signify his assent to the proposal, and offer his daughter Mary, in marriage to Francis, who joyfully embraced this overture. A negotiation was begun by the bishop of Bath and Wells, the English ambassador at Paris, assisted by Sir William Fitzwilliams; but, some difficulties occurring, Francis sent a so∣lemn embassy to London, where his plenipotentiaries treated with the cardi∣nal, who was appointed the king's commissioner for this purpose. Three treaties were concluded, importing, That the two kings should send ambassa∣dors to the emperor with reasonable offers, touching the release of the hostages, and a demand of the sums he owed to the king of England; to which, should he fail in returning an acceptable answer, within twenty days, they should de∣clare war against him without further delay: That the princess Mary should be given in marriage to Francis, or to his son the duke of Orleans, as he should think proper: That the war should be carried on conjunctly in the Low Coun∣tries, according to a certain stipulated proportion; and, That a fleet should be equipped at their joint-expence, to distress the enemy by sea: That the king of Portugal, or any other prince, espousing the cause of Charles, should be deemed and declared an enemy: That the pope and Venetians should be comprehended in the league, on condition of their maintaining the war in Italy: That Henry should renounce, for himself and successors, all right and pretensions to the crown or territories of France; in consideration of which cession, Francis and his suc∣cessors should pay to all succeeding kings of England, a perpetual pension of
<PB N="578" REF="5900"/>
fifty thousand crowns, to commence at the death of Henry, who was already intituled to two millions by the treaty of Moore; and that, over and above this pension, Francis should furnish the king of England annually, with salt of Brouage to the value of fifteen thousand crowns: That this treaty should be approved and signed by the archbis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ops, bishops, princes, dukes, counts, barons, and other noblemen of both kingdoms, whose names were specified in the ar∣ticle, by the parliaments of Paris, Tholouse, Rouen, and Bourdeaux, as well as by all the courts of judicature in England; and confirmed by the states of<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> France and England, as a perpetual and inviolable constitution. The news of the pope's captivity arriving soon after the conclusion of these treaties, the par∣ties agreed, that instead of carrying on the war in the Low Countries, they should act so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely in Italy; and as English troops could not be transported into that country without great trouble, time, and expence, the French king took upon himself the maintenance of the war, on condition of Henry's paying a certain monthly sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="80" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LXXX.</HEAD>
<P>These treaties being ratified, the king of England sent Sir Francis Poyntz to Spain, to demand of Charles, that as he had been at half the expence of the war, he should have half the booty taken at Pavia, together w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h one of the hostages of Francis; and Clarencieux the herald, accompanied t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is envoy in disguise, that he might denounce war, in case of a refusal. Charles, who plainly peceived that Henry wanted nothing but a pretext for a rupture, resolved, if possible, to gain time. He answered with great gravity, that the message being of great importance, he would deliberate with himself upon the nature of it; and signify his determination by a letter to the king of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert.</NOTE> England. This procrastination being deemed equivalent to a repulse, Francis ordered Lautrec to begin his march with the forces destined for Italy; and cardi∣nal Wol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey set out for the continent, in order to confer with the French king at Amiens. He arrived at Calais on the eleventh day of July, and repaired to Abbeville, with a train of one thousand horse gaily caparisoned. He was re∣ceived on the frontiers of France with the same honours that would have been payed to the king of England. Francis complimented him with letters patent, impowering his great friend the cardinal to release the prisoners in all the places through which he passed, except such as were confined for treason, rape, and murder. While he waited at Abbeville until the king of France should come to Amiens, he received a memorial from the emperor, who now seemed desir∣ous of a pacification. The king of France had offered to execute the treaty of Madrid, provided Francis S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orza should be re-established in possession of Milan: That Charles should receive, in lieu of Burgundy, two millions of golden crowns, send queen Eleonora with the two hostages to France, allowing that princess a dower in proportion to the great sum he was to touch; and pay what he owed to the king of England. To these propositions the emperor now replied, That his right to B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gund<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should remain in full force as before the treaty of Madrid: That all the articles of that treaty should be executed, except such as he should now consent to wave: That he hoped the king of England, and the lord legate, would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the French king to a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g∣ment the sum of two millions he had offered; at least, he insisted upon its being payed, over and above what he Charles owed to the king of England, a debt which Francis had bound himself to discharge; and besides the restitution of
<PB N="579" REF="5910"/>
the effects belonging to the late duke of Bourbon, as it was but reasonable that his heirs should receive the benefit of this treaty: That the queen his sister should be sent to France with the hostages, as soon as the other articles could be executed: That Francis Sforza being accused of treason, the emperor would appoint competent judges to try that nobleman; and, in case of his being found innocent, he should be re-established in his dutchy; but, if convicted, the state of Milan should remain at the disposal of the emperor, according to justice and reason: and lastly, That the king of England should become guarantee of the treaty. He moreover demanded, That Francis would indemnify him for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sandoval. Herbert.</NOTE> expences to which he had been exposed from the league that monarch had formed against him, leaving the estimation of that expence to the king of Eng∣land, who was perfectly well acquainted with the nature of all their transac∣tions. He said, he still considered the legate as his friend; he declared himself so well disposed towards a pacification, that if the king of England should think his proposals unreasonable, he would make greater concessions for him than for any prince in Europe; and as a mark of his singular esteem for that monarch, desired, that all the world would ascribe to him the glory of having effected the accommodation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="81" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LXXXI.</HEAD>
<P>These advances were rejected by the kings of France and Eng∣land, who were now bent upon the prosecution of the war; and the cardinal meeting Francis at Amiens, three new treaties were concluded to the following effect: That the duke of Orleans should espouse the princess Mary; and the treaty of Moore remain in full force: That the king of England should form no claim upon Francis for the money he should expend in the war of Italy; but pay a certain contribution, in proportion to the number of troops which the French king should maintain in that country. The second treaty related to trade, and specified certain privileges, which Francis granted to the English merchants. In the third, the two kings agreed that they would never consent to the convocation of a general council, during the pope's captivity: that they would receive no bull, brief, or mandate, from his holiness, until he should be set at liberty; but, in the mean time, punctually execute every thing that should be determined in England by the cardinal legate, wth the concurrence of the clergy; and, in France, by the principal members of the Gallican church. These conventions being ratified, the contracting parties thought proper to make some answer to the propositions of the emperor. Francis still insisted upon the re-establishment of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orza<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the release of the hostages; while Henry, in a formal manner, demanded payment of the sums which Charles had borrowed of himself and his father; together with five hundred thousand crowns, which he had engaged to forfeit, in case he should not espouse the princess Mary: he likewise insisted upon being indemnified by Charles for the arrears of the pension due to him from France, according to a stipulation in the treaty of Windsor; and lastly, he required him not only to release his holiness, but also to make good the damage he had sustained from the Imperial forces. To these demands the emperor answered, That he had never denied the debt he owed to the king of England: that he would inform that monarch, by letter, of his reasons for thinking himself acquitted of the penalty upon the contract of marriage; and that he had already sent orders to Italy, to set the pope at liberty.</P>

<P>This was not the first time that Henry had interposed in be∣half of Clement; who, together with his thirteen fellow-prisoners, had, in let∣ters, sollicited the king's protection. Henry had written in their behalf to Charles, who answered in general terms, That he would do all that lay in his po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er for the satisfaction of the king of England: but, he had, by this time, resolved to convey Clement to Spain, where he thought he could manage him more for his advantage, than while he remained in Italy; and, in the mean time, he carried his deceit to such a ridiculous length, as to order public prayers to be put up for the deliverance of his holiness. At the same time he endea∣voured to excite jealousy and distrust between the kings of France and England. He proposed to the cardinal a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atch between Henry's natural son, the duke of Richmond, and Isabella, princess of Portugal, to whom he offered to give the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> dutchy of Milan as a dower; and the king affected to be pleased with the pro∣posal, for his own convenience. But it was not in the power of the emperor to shake the good understanding between him and Francis; who, about this time, sent Anne de Montmorency, with the order of St. Michael, to his new ally; and Henry, in return, complimented him with the garter, by the hands of Ar∣thur<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

Charles likewise at∣tempted to gain over the cardinal by advantageous offers, but Wolsey was too far engaged with Francis to retreat; or he was determined at all events to be revenged on the emperor, by whom he had been twice deceived; and perhaps the king's divorce from Catherine was already resolved upon, in which case he could not possibly espouse the interest of Charles. Certain it is, the car∣dinal, in a letter to the king, dated on the thirty-first day of August, told him it was already reported in Spain, that his majesty intended to obtain a di∣vorce, and counselled him to send orders to his ambassadors in that country, to stifle the rumour as soon as possible, by alledging it had no other foundation than some scruples expressed by the bishop of Tarbe, on the subject of the pro∣jected match between the duke of Orleans and the princess Mary, as if there had been some room to doubt her legitimacy.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert.</NOTE> We have already said that the Imperial army loitered away their time in Rome, and that neighbourhood, where they were greatly diminished by excesses and the plague; and, with great difficulty, governed by the prince of Orange, whom they had chosen general, at the death of the duke of Bourbon: we have also observed that Francis had sent Lautrec into Italy, to command the forces of a league, in which he had engaged with the Venetians. Andrea Doria, who commanded the French gallies, reduced Genoa under the dominion of Francis, in the beginning of the campaign; and Lautrec, being joined by the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> marquis de Saluces, made himself master of Vigevano, Alexandria, and Pavia. Then he began his march for Naples, was admitted into Parma and Placentia; the duke of Ferrara declared for France, and his example was soon followed by<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i.</NOTE> the duke of Mantua. The emperor had sent an order to the viceroy of Naples to release the pope, on condition that he should give security for paying the ar∣rears of the army, and detaching himself from the league; but, as he had no such security to grant, the negotiation proceeded very slowly. However, the French general advancing towards Naples, Moncada, who acted for the em∣peror, at length concluded the treaty, importing, that the pope should not act against the emperor in the affairs of Milan and Naples; but grant him a cru∣sade

<P>IT was during the pope's confinement, that king Henry first declared his intention of being divorced from his wife Catherine, though, in all probability, the resolution was taken before this period; inasmuch as we find<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="584" REF="5960"/>
by the cardinal's letter to the king, that the report was current in Spain, while he continued at Abbeville. Some historians, in order to blacken the character of Henry, and tarnish the merit of the reformation in England, have repre∣sented the king's pretended scruples as the effect of his passion for Anne Boleyn, daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, a young lady who had been educated in France; and was at this juncture a maid of honour to queen Catherine. They likewise have, with great virulence, endeavoured to depreciate her person and her morals; and, in the course of their contumely, fallen into divers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which have been detected and exposed by authors of more credit<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>der<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.

These have not only <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her cal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mniators, but also proved that Henry was determined upon the divorce before Anne Boleyn returned to England. The king had an ingredient of superstition in his character, and could not help imputing the death of his two sons to the displeasure of God almighty, at his incestuous marriage with his brother's widow. He was ex∣tremely desirous of male issue, that all disputes about the succession might be prevented. He was startled at the observation of the bishop of Tarbe, who expressed some doubts about his daughter's legitimacy: he was tired of pos∣sessing Catherine, who was not mistress of many personal attractions: he was a prince of impetuous passions, and longed to be united with a lady of more endearing qualifications, by whom he might be blessed with male issue, against whose legitimacy no plausible exceptions could be taken. His scruples of conscience first raised by the writings of Thomas Aquinas, were encouraged by Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey, who hated the queen, because she had expressed her disapprobation of his loose and libertine way of living; and he was actuated by revenge against her nephew the emperor, who had twice baffled him in his designs upon the papacy. Henry thought he could never find a more favourable conjuncture to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e for a divorce than the present; when the emperor's power was become formidable to all the princes in Christendom, and the pope's deliverance de∣pended in a peculiar manner upon the assistance and interposition of England and her allies: perhaps too his conduct was influenced by the beauty of Anne Boleyn, who now began to be distinguished above all her cotemporaries.</P>

<P>Be that as it may, he himself professed scruples of conscience <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed, that archbishop Warham, who had at first declared against the marriage, should consult the bishops of England upon the subject. The prelate com∣plied with his request; and presented him with a writing, in which they con∣demned the marriage as a contract contrary to public decency, and the divine law. This declaration was subscribed by all the prelates, except Fisher bishop of Rochester, whose name is said to have been counterfeited by cardinal Wol∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey. The writings of Luther had by this time produced such a spirit of in∣quiry in England, that the people openly affirmed, the dispensation for the marriage granted by pope Julius II. could never justify, or consolidate a mar∣riage so notoriously opposite to the law of God. This would have been a very sufficient reason for dissolving the match in the eye of equity; but, it would have been a very imprudent step in Henry, to sollicit a favour of the court of Rome, by seeking to invalidate the authority of a Roman pontiff: he therefore endeavoured to find nullities in the bull of Julius, by which it would be ren∣dered revocable by the maxims of the holy see. The bull had been founded on the request of Henry and Catherine, on the supposition, that their marriage
<PB N="585" REF="5970"/>
was necessary to preserve peace between Spain and England. Now Henry, being then but twelve years of age, could not be supposed to have such politic views; whence it was inferred, that he was not really author of the request. Besides, the situation of affairs at that time was such, as proved the marriage was unnecessary for the preservation of the peace between England and Spain; consequently, pope Julius had been deceived: and lastly, it was sollicited as the means of maintaining the good understanding between Ferdinand and Isabella, and Henry VII. whereas, at the consummation, Isabella and Henry VII<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were not alive. It was moreover, alledged, that Henry VIII. in having protested against his marriage before it was consummated, gave up the liberty granted to him by the bull; and therefore another was necessary to render his marriage valid. The king having found these subterfuges to serve as a pretext for Clement, to revoke the dispensation of his predecessor, sent Knight his secretary to Rome, with four papers to be signed by his holiness. The first was a commission to cardinal Wolsey, to judge and determine the affair, in conjunction with some English bishops. The second was a decretal bull, annulling the marriage be∣tween the king and Catherine, as the nuptials of that princess with his brother Arthur had been previously consummated. The third contained a dispensation for Henry's marrying another wife. And in the fourth, the pope engaged never to revoke the other three. Knight, at his arrival in Rome, being denied admit∣tance to the pope, who was strictly guarded by a Spanish captain, found means to convey a memorial, containing the heads of his commission, to his holiness, who returned a favourable answer, though the emperor had already desired he would take no step in that affair without first imparting it to his ministers. Car∣dinal Wolsey, in a letter to Gregorio Casali the English ambassador at Rome, or∣dered him to second the endeavours of Knight; and they waited on Clement after his retreat to Orvietto. He promised to exert himself for the satiasfac∣tion of the king; but, begged the affair might not be precipitated. He was at this juncture uncertain, whether he should have occasion for the assistance of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> Henry, or be able to effect an accommodation with the emperor. He there∣fore wanted to gain time, but was so hard pressed by the English envoy, to de∣clare himself, that he promised to sign the acts, on condition that they should not be produced until after the departure of the French and Germans from Italy. Though this condition was accepted, he still protracted the affair, on pretence of consulting Lorenzo Pucci, cardinal Sanctorum quatuor, who being secured by a largess of English gold, altered the legate's commission, which had been defective; and joined Knight and Casali, in pressing Clement to sign it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Herbert.</NOTE> without further delay. Thus importuned, he put his hand to the commission, and the bull of dispensation for the king, promising to send the other decretal bull for dissolving the marriage to England, after he should have considered the subject more maturely. But he dated those two acts at the time when he was prisoner in the castle of St. Angelo; so that Henry did not choose to make use of them, left it should be objected, that the pope had granted them merely with a view to obtain his liberty by the assistance of England. Clement had by this<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1528.</NOTE> time smarted so severely by his opposition to the emperor, that he absolutely refused to reingage in the league with France, England, and Venice. When pressed on this subject by the ambassadors of those powers, he observed, that
<PB N="586" REF="5980"/>
his junction with the league might expose him to new misfortunes, without procuring any real advantage to their cause; and that he was resolved to act as a mediator, rather than involve himself as a party. He had by this time formed the design of re-establishing the family of Medicis in Florence; and foresaw that such a re-establishment could not be effected but by means of the empe∣ror, because the Florentines had joined the allies: but, he would not declare for Charles until he should see the success of the war between him and the con∣federates. Every thing now seemed to portend the effusion of blood, ruin, and desolation.</P>

<P>The ambassadors of France and England, residing in Spain, desired permission to retire; and next day Clarencieux and Guien<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, the heralds of Henry and Francis, pronounced a declaration of war, in presence of the em∣peror, fitting on his throne, and surrounded by his grandees. In answer to Clarencieux, Charles complained, that the king of England wanted to join him in marriage with a princess whom he intended to bastardize, by obtaining a divorce from her mother: but, he laid the whole blame on the excessive am∣bition of cardinal Wolsey, who was disgusted at the emperor, because he would not embroil Christendom by endeavouring to raise him to the papacy. He denied that he had ever refused to pay the debt he owed to Henry; but said, the English ambassadors who demanded the money, had no power to grant a discharge. With respect to the imdemnity, he observed, that the king of France had taken it upon himself in the treaty of Madrid. With regard to the sum of five hundred thousand crowns, which he had obliged himself to pay, in case <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should refuse to wed the princess Mary, he declared, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had demanded her by ambassadors; and that her father had not only refused to send her into Spain, but had even offered her in marriage to the king of Scotland: besides, Henry could not legally demand the sum, until after having proved, that he had exe∣cuted all the articles of the treaty of Windsor.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>In his answer to the French herald, he loudly taxed Francis with breach of promise, and desired Guienne to remind his master of what he had pro∣posed by the archbishop of Bourdeaux, namely, That they should decide their quarrel in single combat. The French king no sooner received this message than he sent back the same herald to the emperor, with a formal defiance, in which he gave Charles the lie; and demanded of him security of the field in which they should fight body to body. The emperor accepted the challenge, and dispatched one of his herald with another remonstrance on the subject. He found great difficulty in being admitted to the king's presence; and when he began to speak, was interrupted by Francis, who being afraid of hearing some disagreeable repartee, asked, if he had brought security for the field, as every thing else was superfluous? He was answered in the affirmative; and desired permission to read the emperor's cartel. This, however, he could not obtain. Francis rose hastily, after having uttered some angry expressions; and ordered the herald to quit his dominions. In this whole affair he acted a part unbecoming a man of honour: first, in renouncing the treaty to which he owed his deliverance: secondly, in trespassing the bounds of decorum, by send∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andoval Herbert.</NOTE> such a scurrilous message to Charles: and, thirdly, in his behaviour to the herald, which denoted equal insolence and trepidation. On the other

<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>Hugh de Mendoza the Spanish ambassador at London, being informed of these transactions, would have retired immediately; but, Wolsey assuring him, that the herald had exceeded his orders<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and would be severely punished at his return, he sent a courier to inform the emperor of this declaration. Clarencieux, who was still in Spain, being apprized of this circumstance, de∣manded, and obtained an authentic copy of the ambassador's letter; and arriv∣ing privately in England, went directly to the king, to whom he produced this testimony, together with three other letters, written in his own hand, by which Clarencieux had been peremptorily ordered to denounce war against the em∣peror. Henry was so exasperated at this information, that in the transport of his anger, he chid the cardinal for his presumption in the most acrimonio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ex∣pressions; and, in all probability, would have disgraced him intirely, had not he foreseen, that he should have occasion for his ministry in the affair of the divorce. The matter, however, was examined in council; and though Wolsey pleaded, that he imagined what he had done was conformable to the king's intentions, he received a severe and mortifying rebuke. The report which Cla∣rencieux made of the honourable treatment he had met with at the court of the emperor, made an impression upon Henry. He seemed loth to break with a prince who treated him with such personal respect; and the trade between England and the Low Countries being of great consequence to the nation, some overtures were made for keeping it still open. Mean while, the merchants, in consequence of the declaration of war, refused to buy the cloth that was brought to market at Blackwell-Hall; and the manufacturers mutinied in di∣vers parts of England. The same commotions happening in Flanders, Mar∣garet, gouvernante of the Low Countries, with the advice of the emperor's council, sent over two ambassadors to sollicit a truce, which they obtained for eight months, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the French ambass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dor, and the insinuations of the cardinal, whose credit about this time began to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hall.

<P>During these transactions, the Imperial army at Rome being reduced to a wretched condition by the plague, the prince of Orange, with the remains of it, retreated towards Naples, before the arms of Laut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>c, who be∣ing reinforced to the number of thirty thousand men, undertook the siege of that capital while it was blocked up by se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the gallies of France, Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice, and Genoa.

<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>The success of the Imperialists in Italy raised fresh obstacles to Hen∣ry's divorce from Catherine. The pope, when sollicited to issue new bulls on that subject, that should be more explicit than those he had signed at Orvietto, advised the king of England privately, to make use of the commission which he had already granted to the legate for annulling the marriage, and espouse another wife, according to his own inclination, in which case he would confirm the marriage; alledging, that it would be easier for him to grant a confirmation of what was already done, than a dispensation to do that which was undone. Henry looked upon this advice as a subterfuge for some sinister purpose. He foresaw, that if he should take another wife in this manner, he would be altogether in the power of his holiness, who might confirm or annul the marriage at pleasure; and therefore he resolved to per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in demanding new bulls for terminating the affair of the divorce. Wolsey's secretary, Stephen Gardiner, and Edward Fox, were sent to Rome to demand a new commission, impowering the cardi∣nal to di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>olve the marriage, and yet declare the daughter born of that marriage legitimate, as well as a decretal bull to dissolve the king's marriage; and a dis∣pensation for his wedding another wife, without any restriction. At the same time, the envoys were ordered to make the pope acquainted with the extraordi∣nary merit of Anne Boleyn, on whom the king had by this time settled his af∣fection; and to tell his holiness, that the cardinal had no share in advising the divorce. Gardiner and Fox arriving at Orvietto, when Lautrec was on his march towards Naples, the pope wanted to protract the discussion of this affair until he should see the success of the campaign; and for this purpose, endeavoured to amuse Henry with a letter written in cypher, which nobody could explain. This expedient w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> very ill received by the king, who sent orders to his envoys to insist upon the former demands; and as by this time the French general had made conquests in the kingdom of Naples, Clement, afraid of disobliging Hen∣ry, who was so closely connected with Francis, signed a bull, constituting car∣dinal Wolsey judge of the affair, in conjunction with the archbishop of Canter∣bury, or any other English prelate. The king's council considered this com∣mission as defective, because it contained no clause to prevent the pope from rever∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the decr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; and implied a manifest nullity, in appointing as sole judge of the affair, a cardinal devoted to the king, and actually his prime minister. Henry therefore demanded, that another legate should be joined to Wolsey; and that the pope should, by a formal engagement, renounce all power of revoking the commission. As Lautrec had now undertaken the siege of Naples, Clement made no scruple to comply with these demands. He appointed Wolsey and Campejus his l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gates a latere, establishing them as his vicegerents in the affair of the divorce; and for that purpose vesting them with his whole authority. He likewise granted the formal engagement touching the revocation; and furnish∣ed Campejus with a decretal, annulling the king's marriage. These conces∣sions were made at different periods, in order to protract the time; and before the decretal passed, Clement, in all probability, had resolved to thwart Henry in the affair of his divorce; for, by this time, Lautrec was dead, and the French army ruined: so that the pope had nothing to fear from the confederates. He had resolved to accommodate all differences with the emperor, whom he therefore would not disoblige by being accessory to the disgrace of his kinswoman Ca∣therine:
<PB N="589" REF="6010"/>
but, on the other hand, until this accommodation could be effected, he was averse to a rupture with Henry, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he should be lest at the mercy of the emperor; and obliged to embrace such terms as he should think proper to im∣pose. His aim then was to temporize and spin out the affair o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the divorce, until he should have compromised all his disputes with Charles, from whom he had reason to expect favourable terms, while he maintained a seeming con∣nexion with France and England. He directed his legate Campejus to pro∣tract the affair as long as possible: to forbear giving sentence of divorce, until he should receive new orders under the hand of his holiness: and to avoid com∣municating the bull to any person whatsoever, except the king and the car∣dinal.</P>

<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Campejus arriving in England, began his legation, by exhorting the king to live in good understanding with Catherine; and desist from his sollicitation of the divorce. This advice being very ill received, he endeavoured to persuade the queen to consent to the separation; but, his counsel was rejected by Catherine, who told him she was the king's lawful wife, and so would con∣tinue, until she should be declared otherwise by the pope's sentence. Then the legate declared, he could proceed no farther without new orders; and six months elapsed before these could be obtained. In the mean time, he flattered the king with the hope of seeing his desire accomplished, and amused him and Wolsey with a sight of the bull; but when he was pressed to produce it before some lords of the council, he pleaded the pope's order to the contrary. Henry, incensed at this method of proceeding, complained to Clement, who justified<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE> the conduct of the legate; and gave the court to understand, that the bull should not be published, except the sentence of the legates should be favoura∣ble to his majesty.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>While the pope thus trifled with Henry, his negotiation with the em∣peror was still continued; and now he sought a pretence for breaking with the kings of France and England, who were no longer formidable in Italy. They had promised to procure for him the restitution of Ravenna and Cervia, and now he loudly complained, that they had not performed their engagements. At length, they received intimation of his treating with the emperor; and upbraided him in their turn with double-dealing. He still denied he had any intention to depart from his neutrality; and sent Francisco Campana to Eng∣land, with assurances of his good intention. This envoy carried an order to Campejus, to burn the decretal bull, and protract the divorce to the utmost of his power. He accordingly found new pretences for delaying the proceedings, until at length Henry, impatient of such procrastination, sent Sir Francis Bryan, and Peter Vannes to Rome, to dive into the real cause of this delay. They were directed to search the pope's chancery for a pretended brief, which as the Spaniards gave out, confirmed the dispensation for Catherine's marriage, granted by pope Julius; to propose divers expedients for facilitating the determination of the divorce; to offer a guard of two thousand men to the pope, in case he should be intimidated by the threats of the emperor; or should this proposal be rejected to counterballance the threats of Charles with menaces from Henry. The two envoys executed the first part of their commission; and finding the pope inclining to the interest of the emperor, told him plainly, that should he refuse granting the satisfaction their master demanded, England would certainly
<PB N="590" REF="6020"/>
renouce him and all the popes his successors. They observed, that the Eng∣lish people wanted nothing but their king's permission to shake off all obedi∣ence to the papal power; that he was on the brink of raising two formidable enemies to himself, in the persons of Francis and Henry; and that as the king of England had engaged in the war, merely with a view to deliver his holiness from imprisonment, all Christendom would look with horror upon his ingrati∣tude, should be engage in a league against his deliverer. These remonstrances produced <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o effect upon the pope, who answered in general terms; and pre∣tended to think himself in a very dangerous situation, from which he could be relieved by nothing but the signal interposition of heaven. The questions pro∣posed by the envoys, to able canonists, were these, Whether, if the queen should take the veil, the king might be at liberty to take another wife? Whether, if the king and queen should take the vows together, the pope would grant him a dispensation to marry again during the life of Catherine? and, Whether the pope could grant him permission to have two wives? The answers to these questions never transpired. But, the pope's chancery being searched, no brief appeared;<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.

<P>Although the pope had laid down a resolution to thwart the king, he still continued to heap favours on his minister. He obtained several bulls for suppressing divers small monasteries, and many other grants towards the esta∣blishment of his two colleges, which he had very much at heart; and indeed, he could not be too alert in seizing the present opportunity, which, if he had neglected, the work in all probability would have remained imperfect. With respect to Scotland, Henry in the course of this year sent ambassadors to the court of his nephew James, with proposals of peace; but, as this could not be effected, on account of the distractions of that kingdom, which was divided into t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en dowager, and the family of Doug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce was concluded at Berwick, for five years.

In the mean time, he continued to amuse the king of England with promises, that the affair of the divorce should be determined according to his wish; and delivered into Gardiner's hands a brief, in which he declared he would not revoke the power he had granted to the legates.

<P>The emperor being well assured of the pope's sentiments touching the divorce, entered in the name of his aunt queen Catherine a formal protest against all that should be done in England on that subject by the lega<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, one of whom be alledged was entirely devoted to Henry, and the other bishop of Salisbury in his dominions.

Henry, when called upon, answered, Here; but, the queen being cited, arose, and falling on her knees before Henry, <Q>“I am (said she) a poor woman, and stranger in your dominions, where I can neither expect disin∣terested counsel, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpartial judges. I have been your wife twenty years and upwards, have bore you several children, and ever studied to please you. I protest you found me a true maid, concerning which I appeal to your own conscience. If I have done amiss, let me be put away with shame. Our parents were esteemed wife princes, and no doubt had good counsellors, when they agreed upon our marriage. I therefore will not submit to the court. My lawyers are your subjects, and dare not speak freely in my be∣half; for which reason, I desire to be excused until I shall hear from Spain.”</Q> So saying, she rose, and making a low reverence to the king, retired from court, paying no regard to the crier, who required her to stay. After her departure Henry declared, that she had been always a true and obedient wife, and was possessed of many excellent qualities; but, that his conscience being disquieted by a remark which had been made by the bishop of Tarbe the French ambas∣sador, he had resolved to try the law<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulness of his marriage, for the ease of his mind, and the benefit of the succession. He said he had mentioned this scru∣ple in confession to the bishop of Lincoln; and desired the archbishop of Can∣terbury to procure the opinions of all the prelates, who had under their hands and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eals disapproved of the marriage. The bishop of Rochester declaring, that he had not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et his hand to this writing, the metropolitan of Canterbury said, he had consented to let another write his name; but this circumstance he of Rochester positively denied. The queen being again cited to appear, appeal∣ed to the pope, and was declared contumacious. Then the legates drew up twelve articles to be discussed by the examination of evidence. They declared, that prince Arthur and the king were brothers: that prince Arthur had mar∣ried Catherine, and consummated the marriage: that upon the death of Ar∣thur, Henry by virtue of a dispensation had married the widow: that this mar∣riage with his brother's wife, was forbidden both by human and divine law: and, that upon the complaints which the pope had received, his holiness had sent them to try and decide in the affair. The king's council insisted chiefly on the consum∣mation of Arthur's marriage; and in the course of their pleadings spoke so in∣decently, that the bishop o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rochester signified his disapprobation and disgust. He was checked by Wolsey for presuming to interpose; and some severe alter∣cation passed between these prelates. The evidence, however, produced many strong presumptions, that Arthur had carnally known the queen, though she herself declared, and even swore the contrary.</P>

<P>While the legates proceeded very slowly in this process, the em∣peror's ministers pressed the pope to evoke the cause to Rome; and the Eng∣lish envoys exerted all their influence to prevent this evocation. Both sides threatened to depose him on account of his bastardy, and he pretended to be intimidated by their menaces, which however furnished him with a reason for postponing his declaration, until he had concluded his treaty with the empe∣ror. Then he plainly told the English agents, that he had resolved to evoke the cause of the divorce to Rome; and though they assured him that such a step would certainly dismember the holy see of the spiritual dominion of England, he refused to retract his resolution. The emperor had engaged by
<PB N="593" REF="6050"/>
treaty to re-establish the house of Medicis in the sovereignty of Florence; and this circumstance alone over-balanced every other consideration in the mind of Clement. On the fifteenth day of July he signed the bull of evocation, which he forthwith dispatched by a courier to England, where the process of divorce had been strangely protracted by the artifice of cardinal Campejus, who found means to adjourn the session from time to time, under various pre∣tences. How incensed soever the king must have been at the arrival of this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE> bull of evocation, in which he was cited to appear to Rome in forty days, on pain of ecclesiastical censure, he dissembled his resentment; and though he would not allow the bull to be intimated to him in form, he gave the legates to understand that they were at liberty to obey the pope's order. Clement afterwards, by way of reparation, revoked the censures by a new brief, and prolonged the term of the citation till Christmas.</P>

<P>All those who were acquainted with Henry's disposition, dated the disgrace of the cardinal from this aera; and indeed he had, through the whole of this process, behaved with such languor and indifference as cannot easily be explained, when we consider how much it imported him to gratify his master in this interesting affair. Perhaps he was unwilling to incense the emperor beyond a possibility of reconciliation, in case the affairs of Europe should take a new turn: perhaps he secretly hated Anne Boleyn, as a dangerous rival in the king's favour, or a proselyte to the doctrine of Luther; or he was actuated by some obscure motive of personal dislike. Great men are often influenced by low passions and prejudices, which they are ashamed to avow. Certain it is, the emperor left no stone unturned to ruin the cardinal in the king's opinion; he was at pains to circulate reports invented for the pur∣pose of his destruction; and, by means of his emissaries, Henry received copies of letters, disapproving the divorce, which the cardinal was said to have pri∣vately written to his holiness. On the other hand, Anne Boleyn imputed the miscarriage of the divorce to the backwardness with which Wolsey had acted in the affair; and her resentment was proportioned to the greatness of her dis∣appointment. Her father, now created lord viscount Rochfort, had removed her from court during the process, in order to avoid scandal; but when the commission was vacated, she returned, at the king's desire. After all this pro∣vocation, Henry kept his temper with surprizing equanimity; and, when the two cardinals waited upon him at Grafton, received them with his usual com∣placency. Wolsey was closeted for a considerable time, and dismissed with seeming kindness; and all the courtiers, who hated him in their hearts, still behaved towards him with the usual respect and appearance of veneration.</P>

<P>Henry, in order to amuse his impatience, and divert his chagrin, made a progress through some counties; and, in his return, lay at Waltham Cross, in the house of Mr. Cressey. This gentleman had committed the education of his two sons to Thomas Cranmer, a doctor in theology, who had been pro∣fessor at Oxford, and lost his office on account of his being married. He was eminent for his learning, piety, and moderation; and secretly favoured the doctrine of Luther, whose books he had read in Germany. At supper he was desired by Fox and Gardiner to give his sentiments of the divorce; and, being pressed on the subject, he proposed that the king should procure the opinions of all the universities, theologists<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and civilians of Christendom; who would
<PB N="594" REF="6060"/>
either judge the dispensation of pope Julius II. valid, or insufficient: if valid, the king's conscience would be at ease; if insufficient, the pope could never venture to declare himself against the opinion of all the able men in Christen∣dom. When this proposal was communicated to the king, he testified his satisfaction, by exclaiming, "Aye, now we have the right sow by the car." He desired to hear it from Cranmer's own mouth, and was so pleased with his conversation, that he commanded him to follow the court, and ever after con∣sulted him in all emergencies. On the king's return from this progress he sent a message to the cardinal, demanding the great seal, which he at first refused to deliver; but, Henry writing to him next day, he gave it to the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, and it was offered to Warham, archbishop of Canter∣bury, who had formerly been chancellor; but, he declining the offer, on ac∣count of his great age, it was given to Sir Thomas More, who had signalized himself for his learning and integrity.</P>

<P>Campejus, not a little alarmed at this prelude to Wol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey's fal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, took leave of the king, in order to return to Italy; and Henry expressed no displeasure at parting with that prelate. Before he embarked in person, the custom-house officers rummaged all his baggage, on pretence of searching for contraband goods; though it is supposed they acted by the express directions of the king, who wanted to seize the decretal bull, not knowing that it was already committed to the flames. When the cardinal complained of this insult, as an outrage committed against a legate of the holy see, Henry told him, That the officers had done their duty: That he was sur∣prized at his assuming the character of legate, after his power and commission had been revoked; and still more surprized, that, being bishop of Salisbury, he should be so ignorant of the laws of the land, as to assume that quality without the king's permission. Campejus, intimidated by this answer, thought himself extremely happy in being allowed to depart without further molestation.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>On the ninth day of October, Hales, the attorney-general, pre∣sented an information in the King's Bench against the cardinal, accusing him of having violated the statute of Premunire. He confessed the indictment, pleaded ignorance of the statute, and submitted himself to the king's mercy. He was declared out of the king's protection, his goods and chattels were for∣feited to the king; and his palace of York-house, afterwards known by the name of Whitehall, was seized for his majesty's use; together with all the rich furniture and wealth he had amassed. Humbled by this reverse of fortune, he petitioned the king for a protection for his person, which he immediately ob∣tained, with a free pardon. He was restored to the enjoyment of the arch∣bishopric of York and see of Winchester: he retrieved of his own effects to the amount of six thousand pounds in furniture, money, and plate; and re∣ceived divers kind messages from the king and Anne Bol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yn: so that Henry's aim, at this juncture, was to humble the pride, but not ruin the for∣tune, of his old favourite. These favourable sentiments, however, were not of long duration: his enemies now prevailed at court, and brought into the house of lords an impeachment of high treason, in four and forty articles; importing, That he had abused his legatine power, acted tyrannically in the office of chan∣cellor, expedited divers orders of the utmost importance, and executed treaties without the king's knowledge and concurrence; behaved despotically on
<PB N="595" REF="6070"/>
many occasions, more like an eastern sovereign than an English minister; practised extortion, bribery, and all manner of corruption; sought to equal, and even to prefer himself, to his majesty, by writing in orders and instruc∣tions, Ego et rex meus, I and my king; and endangering his sovereign's health by breathing upon him, and whispering in his ear, when he knew himself deeply infected with the venereal distemper. These articles passed in the house of lords, which was filled with his enemies; but, when the bill was carried down to the commons, Thomas Cromwell, a member of that house, who had been the cardinal's domestic, defended him with such strength of argument, that no act of treason could be proved against him; and the prosecution was dropped. The cardinal manifested very little fortitude under his misfortune: he became abject and disconsolate; and, at length, sickened in consequence of such re∣peated mortifications. The king's tenderness seemed to revive when he heard of Wolsey's distemper; he had formerly sent him a turquoise ring, as a tes∣timony of his protection, which the cardinal received upon the road to Win∣chester. He was so affected with this instance of the king's goodness, that he alighted from his horse, and fell upon his knees in a transport of joy. Henry now sent him another present of a ruby, by his physician doctor Butts, who as∣sured him his highness was not angry with him in his heart; and that he should, in a little time, be convinced of his affection. This kind message contributed in a great measure to the recovery of the cardinal, who supplicated and obtained<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holling<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed.

<P>While the attention of the English court was engrossed by the affair of the divorce, and the disgrace of Wolsey, Francis, seeing no other prospect of retrieving his hostages from the hands of the emperor, resolved to effect an accommodation with that power, and set on foot a private negotiation for this purpose; while he amused the Venetians, the Florentines, and the duke of Fer∣rara, with the promise of marching into Italy at the head of a powerful army. Perhaps he would not have found Charles so well disposed for peace, had not he been influenced by the preparations of the Turks for invading Hungary and Austria, and the commotions of the protestants in Germany. Thus threatened, he affected great moderation. The articles being privately discussed, the emperor's aunt Margaret, gouvernante of the Low Countries, and Louisa of Savoy, mother to the French king, repaired to Cambray, where they signed the treaty of peace; importing, That the emperor should, for the present, wave his demand of Burgundy: That the king of France should pay two mil∣lions of golden crowns for the ransom of his children; withdraw his troops from Italy; cede to Charles the sovereignty of Flanders and Artois; restore the county of Asti, with all that he still maintained in the dutchy of Milan; renounce all pretensions to the kingdom of Naples; espouse queen E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eanor, the emperor's sister; and re-establish the heirs of the late duke of Bourbon in possession of all the estate of that family which had been confiscated. The king of England, being privy to this negotiation, was satisfied with a single article, by which Francis engaged to pay five hundred thousand crowns, which the emperor owed to Henry; and to relieve a jewel, which Philip, the empe∣ror's father, had pledged to Henry VII. for the sum of fifty thousand crowns. Henry behaved with great generosity on this occasion; for he not only freely

The discussion of their affairs was referred to a conference between Charles and the pope at Bologna, where all their different ambassadors attended. There the emperor decreed that the Venetians should restore Ravenna and Cervia to the pope; and to himself some places which they still occupied in the kingdom of Naples. Francis Sforza was put in possession of Milan, on condition of paying a large sum to the emperor. The dispute between the pope and the duke of Ferrara was left to the arbitration of Charles; but that between his ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iness and the Florentines could not be accommodated. They were determined to spend their lives in defence of their liberty; which, nevertheless, they offered to purchase with a sum of money, but the pope insisted upon their receiving the house of Medic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s as their sovereign; and, as they rejected this proposal, the emperor ordered the prince of Orange to besiege their city. Charles, having thus set∣tled his Italian concerns, returned to Germany, where the protestants called aloud for a general council, with the promise of which the emperor had flat∣tered them during the war: but, at his conference with the pope, he had un∣dertaken to reduce them, without gratifying this their desire. They had la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely engaged in a league for their own defence; and this association alarmed Charles to such a degree, that he hastened from Bologna, after having received the imperial crown from the hands of his holiness. Mean while, the prince of Orange lost his life at the siege of Florence, which capitulated on condition of being permitted to preserve its liberty, though the emperor was impowered to regu∣late the form of the government. But, in a few days, the partizans of the house of Medicis exciting a tumult in the city, the administration reverted to pope Clement; the emperor established his son-in-law, Alexander de Medicis, on the same footing which his ancestors had gained, and rendered the sovereign power hereditary in his family.</P>

<P>The king of England still laboured to procure the divorce, in the prosecution of which he had met with such difficulties. The queen had been for some time removed from court, where Anne Boleyn appeared in great splen∣dor, governing Henry by her nod, and receiving incense from the English no∣bility. Cran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er wrote a book in favour of the sollicited divorce, and afterwards accompanied two ambassadors to Bologna, where they had audience of the pope and the emperor. Clement expressed a desire of giving the king satis∣faction; but he dur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not act without the consent of Charles, who declared he would never abandon the cause of his aunt queen Catherine. About the same time Henry sent learned men to consult the foreign universities; and those of Paris, Angers, Bourges, Orleans, Tholouse, Bologna, Ferrara, and Padua, unanimously agreed that the dispensation granted by pope Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius II. being con∣trary to the law of God, the marriage of Henry with Catherine could not be valid. The English universities subscribed to the same opinion, though not
<PB N="597" REF="6090"/>
without great opposition from the masters of arts, especially at Oxford; and a warm contest at Cambridge. This opposition arose from those who were averse to the Lut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eran doctrine, which they were afraid would gain ground under the countenance and protection of Anne Boleyn. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE></P>

<P>Henry, finding his application to the pope ineffectual, prevailed upon his chief prelates and nobility to send a sharp remon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rance, by way of letter, to the pope; in which, after having mentioned the obligations his holi∣ness owed to the king, the decision of so many learned universities, and the little regard which had been payed to them at the court of Rome; they gave him to understand, that, should he refuse to do justice in the affair of the di∣vorce, they would conclude themselves abandoned by the see of Rome, and seek for other remedies. To this letter, which was signed by cardinal Wolsey, the metropolitan of Canterbury, four bishops, two dukes, two marquisses, thirteen earls, two viscounts, three and twenty barons, two and twenty abbots, and eleven commoners, the pope wrote an answer to justify his conduct. His apology was so far from being admitted, that Henry, in order to antici∣pate any step that might be taken by Clement in favour of Catherine, or the cardinal, issued a proclamation, forbidding all persons whatever to purchase any thing from Rome, or elsewhere, that should be contrary to his royal pre∣rogative; or to divulge any thing of that nature, on pain of incurring his in∣dignation, and the penalties specified in the statute of Provisors and Premunire. Then he ordered some learned men in the kingdom to collect, compare, and publish, all that had been or could be alledged in favour of the divorce, in∣cluding the opinions of the universities, and a particular answer to a book,<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbert.

<P>Cardinal Wolsey continued still fluctuating between hope and de∣spair. He had, in the beginning of his disgrace, been reduced to great ne∣cessity, from which he was relieved by the bishop of Carli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le; but afterwards his affairs seemed to take a more favourable turn; he received a full pardon, considerable appointments, and kind messages from the king; and was per∣mitted to sit among the peers in parliament: though he had the mortification to see a bill pass, confirming his own forfeitures to the king; and, among others, his college at Oxford, which Henry afterwards founded in his own name. The cardinal seemed more afflicted at the fate of his college, than at any other circumstance of his misfortune. He wrote to the king in the most humble strain, begging the foundation might be permitted to stand: he sent a pathetic letter on the same subject to Cromwell, who had by this time insi∣nuated himself into the king's confidence; but no regard was paid to his impor∣tunity. At length, Anne Boleyn, and the rest of his enemies, thinking him too near the king, while he resided at Richmond, obtained an order for his removing to his archbishopric of York. He obeyed this command, though not without great reluctance; and retired by slow journeys to Cawood, attended by a re∣tinue of one hundred and twenty horsemen. Upon the road he distributed his alms and benediction with great liberality; and now, for the first time in his life, began to be popular, the people crouding to see him, and ask his blessing, as he passed through the country. Not that he had intirely laid aside the thoughts of worldly grandeur; he intended to be installed, according to the antient custom,
<PB N="598" REF="6100"/>
with great solemnity; and began to make preparations for this ceremony, all access to the choir of York being forbidden, until it should be performed.</P>

<P>While he was thus employed for the gratification of idle vanity, his adversaries exerted themselves so industriously, that, before the day of in∣itallation, he was visited by the earl of Northumberland, warden of the Mar∣ches, and Sir Walter Welsh, a gentleman of the king's privy chamber, who arrested him for high treason, together with one Augustine his physician, who was immediately conveyed to London in the most ignominious manner. Wol∣sey betrayed marks of fear and disorder when the earl signified his errand; but, recovering his spirits a little, protested he would not yield until he should see his commission, which the other refused to produce; yet, at sight of Welsh, he complied with the king's pleasure, because he knew his person and office. Having been indulged with some time to prepare for his journey, he set out for London with an heavy heart; and, by the way, was delivered by Northumberland to the care of the earl of Shrewsbury, steward of the house∣hold, who told him he was commanded to use him respectfully, as one whom the king highly favoured<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and assured him, that though his highness found himself obliged to bring him upon his trial for the satisfaction of some parti∣cular persons, he did not entertain the least doubt of his integrity. Such was the dejection of the cardinal, that his spirits and resolution failed him even after these assurances. He moved very slowly, and stayed a whole fortnight at Sheffield castle, where he was seized with a dysentery. Here he was joined by Sir William Kingston, captain of the king's guard, and constable of the Tower, who came, attended with four and twenty yeomen of the guard, who had been formerly the cardinal's servants. He saluted him on the knee with a very gracious message from the king, who desired he would make no more haste than stood with his health and convenience. But whether Wolsey was conscious of having been engaged in some clandestine transactions with the emperor and pope, which he feared would now be discovered, or apprehended that his adversaries were bent upon his destruction, which they would be able to effect, he remained disconsolate, notwithstanding all those encouraging ad∣dresses, and his distemper gained ground. Nevertheless, he proceeded on his journey until he arrived at Leicester abbey; where, feeling his end approach∣ing, he sent for Sir William Kingston, and spoke to this effect: <Q>“Had I serv∣ed God as diligently as I have done the king, he would not have abandoned my grey hairs: but this is my just reward. I pray you commend me most humbly to the king, desiring him to remember all that hath passed between us about queen Catherine; and then his grace may determine whether or not I have given just cause of offence. He is a prince of royal courage; but, rather than be thwarted in his pleasure, will run the risque of losing one half of his realm. I have often kneeled before him three hours successively, to di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e him from his will and appetite, and could not prevail: therefore, Master Kingston, if ever you be of his council, deliberate seriously upon what you intend to advise; for, once he sets his heart upon any thing, he<NOTE PLACE="marg">He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> is not to be diverted from the pursuit.”</Q> Then he discoursed upon the state of religion, wishing he might take heed of the Lutherans, by the example of those of Bohemia, lest the secular power should be subverted by their practices. In the prosecution of this discourse his speech failed him; and, in a little time,
<PB N="599" REF="6110"/>
he expired. He was privately buried in the abbey; and though the king seemed afflicted at his death, he did not fail to make inquiry about fifteen hun∣dred pounds, which he had lately borrowed from different persons, to defray his necessary expences. Such was the fate of cardinal Wolsey, a churchman of some parts, intolerable pride, and unmeasurable ambition, who had by his in∣trigues raised himself to such a pitch of power and grandeur, as no other ec∣clesiastic under the degree of pope had ever possessed.</P>

<P>By this time the reformation had taken deep root in Germany, al∣though the emperor had banished Luther and all his adherents. In the year that succeeded this decree, the diet assembled at Nuremberg, produced one hundred articles of grievance against the court of Rome; and demanded sa∣tisfaction by means of a free council. The same demand was made in a sub∣sequent diet, and opposed by a decree of the catholics assembled at Ratisbon. In a third diet held at Spire, it was decreed, that the emperor should be in∣treated to convoke a general council in Germany; and in the mean time, that every person should enjoy liberty of conscience. Charles finding himself on the eve of a peace with France, ordered a diet to be assembled in the same place, where it was ordained, that no innovation should be made in religion; and the electors of Saxony and Brandenburgh, the landgrave of Hesse, and the princes of Lunenburg, protesting in the most solemn manner against this de∣cree, their party acquired the name of Protestants. The emperor being incensed at their presumption, resolved to crush them effectually; and for that purpose convoked a diet at Augsburgh, before which the protestants demanded permission to declare their belief. This favour being refused, though they were permitted to deliver it in writing, the landgrave of Hesse retired without taking leave of the emperor, who ordered the gates to be shut for detaining the rest of that persuasion; but, they were opened again at the intreaty of the elector of Saxony. After obstinate debates, the diet enacted a decree against the protest∣ants, who nevertheless, were amused with the hope of a general council. When the diet broke up, the emperor convoked the electors to choose his bro∣ther Ferdinand king of the Romans. This convocation was strongly opposed by the reformers, who represented the inconveniencies that would attend the design of rendering the Imperial dignity hereditary in the house of Austria. Finding their remonstrance on this subject altogether dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egarded, they assem∣bled at Smalcalde, where they concluded a defensive league against all those who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleidan.</NOTE> should attack them on the score of religion; and made a formal protest against the election of a king of the Romans. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The protestant religion had a great number of favourers in Eng∣land, where the writings and sermons of Wickliff and his followers had long ago begun to open the eyes of the people, who were besides oppressed by the pope's authority, and scandalized by the lewd and immoral lives of the last pon∣tiffs who had sat in the chair of St. Peter. They wanted nothing but an op∣portunity to free themselves from this shameful bondage. Henry being well acquainted with their disposition, resolved to renounce all papal jurisdiction; and in the affair of the divorce, stand to the award of his own parliament and clergy. For this purpose, the first was assembled on the sixth day of January; and at the same time, the clergy met in convocation. The session of parlia∣ment was opened by the chancellor, who declared, that the king's desire of see∣ing
<PB N="600" REF="6120"/>
the marriage dissolved, was not actuated by carnal motives, as some mali∣cious people alledged, but suggested by scruples of conscience, and zeal for the good of his kingdom, that the succession to the throne might not be disputed at his decease. Then he produced a great number of books and treatises, writ∣ten by the able<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t divines and casuists of Europe, on the subject of the divorce, with extracts of divers authors antient as well as modern; and the decisions of the universities of France, Italy, and England. These were left on the table for the perusal of the members; and in the mean time, the king imparted his designs to the convocation of the clergy, who unanimously declared, that his marriage was contrary to the law of God. This instance of complaisance, however, did not exempt them from a prosecution with which they had been threatened by his majesty. Cardinal Wolsey had been convicted of exercising the legatine power in England without a special license from the king, and of giving away benefices in that capacity, contrary to the statutes of provisors and premunire, consequently, those who acknowledged his authority, were accessory to his transgression. This was the case with the whole body of the clergy, who were accordingly accused of having violated the laws of the kingdom. Such a prosecution answered Henry's purpose in two respects. It not only furnished him with a pretence for extorting a large sum of money, but also humbled the clergy in the eyes of the people; and rendered them more dependant upon his pleasure. In vain they pleaded, that the king himself had consented to the car∣dinal's exercising his legatine power; they were convicted of the crime laid to their charge, and all their effects confiscated, to the inexpressible satisfaction of the subjects in general, who had long groaned under ecclesiastical tyranny. The clergy seeing how low their credit was among the people, and the little re∣gard which the nation payed to papal authority, resolved to submit, and implore the king's pardon, for which they agreed to present him with one hun∣dred thousand pounds sterling. A committee of the convocation at Canter∣bury being appointed to draw up this act and petition, some individuals in the interest ot the court, proposed, that in this public act, the clergy should own the king as protector and supreme head of the Anglicane church. This pro∣posal at first met with great opposition; and the consideration of the affair was<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> referred till their next meeting, when, by means of archbishop Warham, Tho∣mas Cromwell, and others of the council, it was agreed, that the king should be stiled supreme head of the church, as far as was agreeable to the law of Christ. The convocation of the clergy in the province of York resolved also, to present his majesty with eighteen thousand eight hundred pounds; but, as in the act they did not own the king's supremacy, they were given to understand, that their present would not be accepted; and they thought proper to follow the example of the other convocation.</P>

<P>Henry being satisfied with this acquisition of power, indulged them with an ample pardon: but, the commons refused to pass the bill, unless the laity, who might be liable to the same prosecution, should be comprehended.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> The king being informed of this obstacle, sent a message to the commons, im∣porting, that he was resolved to be master of his own favours, which he would never grant upon compulsion; and the house dreading his displeasure, passed the bill without further opposition. Then he indulged the laity with an act of amnesty, which did not, however, include colleges and monasteries; for, these
<PB N="601" REF="6130"/>
were afterwards obliged to pay for a composition. The pope was now in such an embarrassed situation, that he did not know what course to follow. He by this time had fallen off from the emperor, who had decided against him in the affair of Ferrara. He saw Germany threatened with an invasion by the Turks, the Roman catholic religion endangered by the progress of the reforma∣tion; and an intimate union still subsisting between the kings of France and England: be therefore resolved to wait in silence for a more favourable oppor∣tunity of retrieving his influence with the English nation. Henry, mean while, prorogued the parliament, and ordered the decisions and writings in favour of the divoce to be printed and published, that all his subjects might understand the case before the next session. As he passionately desired to obtain Catherine's consent to a separation, he sent several bishops, and lay noblemen to persuade her to wave her appeal; and, when they pressed her to refer the cause to the de∣cision of four ecclesiastics, and as many seculars, she said she would pray God to send the king a quiet conscience; but, that she was his lawful wife, and would abide by her right, until the court of Rome should declare the con∣trary. Henry finding her obstinacy insurmountable, desired she would choose her residence at any of his manours; and she answered, that to what place soever she should be removed, she could not be removed from the station of his wife. She first repaired to Moore, then to Easthamstead, and afterwards to Ampthill.</P>

<P>Nothing could be more agreeable to the English than the hu∣miliation of the prelates. They now began openly to discuss controverted points of religion; and were by their indiscreet zeal hurried into dangerous ex∣tremities. The bishops, in order to lighten the burden of the sum they had granted to his majesty, were desirous that a part should be borne by the infe∣rior clergy; and the bishop of London assembled some priests of that metropo∣lis in the chapter-house of St. Paul's, to propose an assessment. His purpose was to obtain the consent of a few at first, hoping the rest would follow their example. But all the London priests being apprised of his intention, went thi∣ther in a tumultuous manner, accompanied by a great number of laymen, who fomented the dispute; and when the bishop made the proposal, they answered, they had never meddled with any of the cardinal's faculties, consequently had not fallen in the premunire: that their livings were already too small for their subsist∣ence: that, as the guilt lay intirely among the bishops and abbots, who had good preferment, they only ought to sustain the punishment: as for themselves, they had not transgressed, and therefore would not pay for a pardon. They had already burst open the door, and committed divers irregularities; and now that the bishop's officers threatened them with condign punishment, a sharp conflict ensued, in which his lordship's servants having been very roughly handled, he dismissed the rioters with his blessing, assuring them, they should not be called in question for this disturbance. Far from keeping his word, he complained to the chancellor, by whose order fifteen priests, and five lay∣men were committed to prison; but, whether or not the inferior clergy payed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hall. Burnet.</NOTE> any proportion of the tax, we cannot determine. Henry, alarmed at these com∣motions, resolved to convince his people, that although he had shaken off the papal yoke, his intention was not to violate the essential truths of religion;

The French king not only favoured these reformers, but is even said to have insti∣gated the Turks to invade the Austrian dominions. Charles, without pretend∣ing to suspect him of any such design, sent ambassadors to sollicit a supply of money for the maintenance of the war against the Infidels; and to this address Francis replied, that the emperor had received money enough from him already;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> that he was neither merchant nor banker, to supply his wants; but, that he would have his share in the honour and danger in all enterprizes, which it<NOTE PLACE="marg">An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>2.</NOTE> might become him as a christian prince to undertake. The aim of Francis was to regain the footing he had lost in Italy, by the assistance of the English mo∣narch, and fomenting jealousy between Charles and the pope, whom he sooth∣ed and threatened by turns, according to the prevailing passions of his holiness. He likewise cajoled Henry, by flattering his inclinations in the affair of the di∣vorce, assuring him, that should Clement refuse doing him justice, he would join him in withdrawing all spiritual obedience from the holy see. He con∣cluded an agreement with the princes of the league of Smalcalde; and per∣suaded the king of England to assist them with fifty thousand crowns, remitted by the hands of the French ambassador, as a sum to be employed for the de∣fence<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> and conservation of the rights and privileges of the empire.

Though this was purely defensive, as the articles were not known, the emperor was not a little alarmed, believing, that while the Turks should in∣vade his Austrian dominions, Henry and Francis would attack him in Italy and the Low Countries. He was confirmed in this conjecture, when he un∣derstood that the kings of France and England had agreed to have an inter∣view between Calais and Boulogne.</P>

<P>The parliament meeting on the fifteenth day of January, the com∣mons, who were previously instructed by the court, presented an address, be∣seeching his majesty to consent to the reformation of div<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs abuses which had crep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the immunities enjoyed by the clergy. The king answered, that before he could assent to a proposal of such importance, he would hear what the clergy had to say in their own defence. This step was taken, in order to shew them how much they needed his royal protection, hated as they were by the parliament. Several statutes were enacted, which slightly touched upon the privileges of that body; though they were abundantly consoled for these mor∣tifications, by an act releasing them from the payment of annates to the pop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="603" REF="6150"/>
which had ever been a heavy burden. The statute imported, That since the reign of the late king, above one hundred and sixty thousand pounds had been sent to Rome, on account of annates, or first-fruits, palls and bulls for bi∣shoprics: That the annates had been originally intended as a contribution for a war against the infidels; but, as they were not employed for that purpose, it was enacted, That they should not be payed for the future: That not above five per cent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the actual revenue should be payed for the bulls of bishoprics: That, in case of the pope's refusing to grant them on these conditions, the bi∣shop elect should be presented by the king to the metropolitan of the province, by whom he should be consecrated: but, should the archbishop refuse conse∣cration, on pretence that he himself had not as yet received his bulls or pallium, two prelates nominated by the king should perform the ceremony; and then the elect should be deemed lawfully consecrated. The parliament declared, That it should be in the king's power to annul or confirm this act within a certain time. If, in that interval, he should make an accommodation with the courts of Rome, it should be deemed inviolable; but, should the pope, on account of such accommodation, pretend to harrass the kingdom wiih sentences of ex∣communication and interdict, these censures should be held as null and void; all ecclesiastics were forbid to publish them; but ordered to celebrate divine<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> service, as if they never had been issued.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>About this period the king received a letter from the pope, ob∣serving, that he had heard of his putting away his queen, and keeping an∣other person called Anne, as his wife, to the great scandal of his character, and contempt of the holy apostolic see, before which the suit was still depending: he therefore exhorted him to take back queen Catherine, and dismiss Anne; and in so doing, he would avoid a rupture with the emperor, who could never otherwise digest such an indignity as he had put upon his aunt; and prevent an interruption in the union of Christendom, which was the only security against the progress of the Infidels. It does not appear that Henry sent a par∣ticular answer to this letter; but, he dispatched doctor Bennet to Rome in qua∣lity of ambassador, to lay before the pope the decisions and opinions of univer∣sities and learned men, touching the divorce; and he was charged with a letter, in which the king taxed his holiness with ignorance, partiality, and deceit; de∣clared, that he did not intend to impugn his authority further, unless compelled; desired he would conform to the opinion of so many learned casuists; and do his duty according to the dictates of his conscience. Clement, instead of grati∣fying the king's inclination, expedited a citation, summoning him to appear in person, or by proxy, at Rome, to answer to the queen's appeal; and Sir Edward Karne was sent thither as Henry's excusator. He was instructed to employ the best counsel he could find, to justify the king for not appearing at Rome, on the principles of the canon law, and the prerogatives of the crown of Eng∣land. He was accompanied by Bonner; and found the consistory divided in their opinions of the divorce. Those who favoured the emperor, pressed the pope to proceed in the cause. The more moderate cardinals advised him to act with caution, as in all probability he would lose England by adhering to Charles. The pope himself being informed of the bill concerning annates, expo∣stulated on that subject with the ambassadors, who answered, that as it was still in the king's power to revoke the act, it would depend upon his holiness whe∣ther
<PB N="604" REF="6160"/>
it should be annulled or confirmed. They retained Rovidellus, a learned canonist of Bologna, to plead the king's cause; and they bribed the cardinals of Ravenna, Monte, and Anc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a, to use their influence in his behalf. The excusatory plea was argued in the consistory, and after much dispute, neither allowed nor rejected: but, the vacation approaching, the pope and college of cardinals wrote a letter to Henry, intrea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng, him to send a proxy in the win∣ter. Bonner, who was sent over to England on this occasion, had instructions from the cardinals who were gained over to the king's interest, to assu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e him, that the affair could be judged in no other manner but in the consistory; and that he had nothing to fear from the decision of the pope, who now leaned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> to the French interest.</P>

<P>While these points were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Rome, the parliament of England met again in April; and in the course of the session, a member of the name of Temse moved, that an address might be presented to the king, praying his majesty to take back the queen, and avoid all the inconveniencies that might attend the illegitimation of the princess. Henry was incensed at the freedom of this commoner, for which he c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id the speaker of the house, and appealed to the testimony of his own conscience for the justification of his conduct.

The pop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had sent a message to the king, proposing to send a legate, with two auditors of the Rota<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to try the cause in some indifferent place, reserving the sentence to himself; and that a truce should be established for four years, before the expiration of which he would call a general council. Henry dispatched Sir Thomas Elli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with an answer to these proposals, importing, That he could take no resolution concern∣ing a peace, without the concurrence of the French king: that, considering the present state of religion in Germany, he apprehended a general council would be altogether unseasonable: that he could not send a proxy to Rome, or any other place out of his own dominions, without giving up the prerogative of his c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own, and acting contrary to the laws of his kingdom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, that his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oliness might remit the discussion of the affair to the clergy of Eng∣land, and confirm the sentence they should pronounce. The emperor, alarm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at the designs of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olyman emperor of the Turks, as well as at the interview and league between Henry and Francis, thought it was high time to quiet the cla∣mours of the protestants; and for that purpose repaired to the diet of Rati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bon, where it was decreed, that no person should be molested on account of re∣ligion, until a general council should be convoked. The protestanta were so well satisfied with this indulgence, that they joined the other princes in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur∣nishing Charles with such proportions of men and succours<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as enabled him to assemble a very powerful army, to stop the progress of the Infidels.

Then the emperor repaired to Bolo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, where he had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n interview with the pope, to whom he proposed a general council for the reduction of the prote<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ants, a match between Catherine de Medicis and Sforza duke of Milan; and a league of the Italian powers, who should main∣tain an army to defend their country from invasion.

About this time, doctor Bennet the English envoy made fresh overtures touching the divorce; but they were rejected by the pope, as ex∣pedients that would intrench upon his prerogative.

<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. An. 1533.</NOTE> The English people resolved to concur heartily with the king in all his measures for abolishing the papal authority in this kingdom. The par∣liament assembling in February, enacted a statute, prohibiting all appeals to Rome, under the penalty specified in the statute of Premunire. Cranmer being in Germany when the archbishopric of Canterbury became vacant, was no sooner informed of the king's intention in his favour, than he begged to be ex∣cused from such a burthensome dignity; but, his refusal serving only to confirm Henry in his design of promoting him to that see, he was obliged to return, though he journeyed slowly, in hope that the king's resolution might be altered before his arrival. Henry having great confidence in his learning, courage, and integrity, looked upon him as the only man who could put the finish∣ing stroke to the divorce; and insisted upon his receiving the archbishopric. After Cranmer had submitted with great reluctance to the will of his sovereign<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</NOTE> in this particular, another difficulty occurred. He professed scruples of con∣science about taking the usual oath to the pope; but, at length, the king found out a salvo, which removed his objections. This was a previous protestation against the oath, which he accordingly made, not much for the credit of his character; and was put in possession of the temporalities of the archbishopric. This affair being determined, the convocation of the province of Canterbury was assembled, and required to give their opinion on the following questions: Whe∣ther or not the dispensation of pope Julius II. for the marriage of Catherine and Henry, was sufficient to render the said marriage binding and valid? and, Whe∣ther or not the consummation of Arthur's nuptials with that princess, had been fully proved? On the fifth day of April the convocation declared, That the pope had no power to grant dispensations against the law of God; and, that the consummation of the first marriage had been as fully proved as the nature of the case would permit. The same answers were made to those propositions by the convocation of York; and Henry resolved to proceed upon the cause of the divorce before the judicature of his own clergy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="36" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time, he desired Francis to send over some person of confidence, to whom he might impart certain things which he did not care to divulge; and the French king pitched upon William du Bellay lord of Lan∣geais, who was ordered to tell Henry, that the marriage between the duke of Orleans and Catherine de Medicis was concluded, and would be celebrated at Marseilles in the presence of the pope and Francis: that the presence of the king of England at such a juncture, would probably induce Clement to comply with his desires: or, that should he decline coming in person, he might send thither an envoy to sollicit his affair. When Du Bellay arrived in England, Henry gave him to understand, that as Clement had obstinately rejected all his propo∣sals, he was resolved to renounce Clement in his turn: that he had married Anne Boleyn; but, that he would keep his mariage secret until the month of May, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee if the king of France could prevail upon the bishop of Rome to do him him justice; but, should that pontiff still continue obstinate, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would intirely withdraw himself from the papal power. He likewise told Langeais,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. Du <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> that he had written a book upon the Usurpation of the Roman see, and the pre∣rogatives
<PB N="607" REF="6190"/>
of crowned heads; but would not publish it until all hope of accom∣modation should vanish. It was not in his power, however, to conceal his marriage much longer; for his new wife became pregnant, and it was necessary to make it public, in order to preserve her reputation. The archbishop of Canterbury now demanded his permission to proceed against his former mar∣riage with Catherine, whose consent to the divorce the king attempted to ob∣tain by fair means; but his endeavours proving ineffectual, the queen was cited to appear at Dunstaple, near the place of her residence. She reject∣ing the citation, Cranmer pronounced sentence, declaring her marriage null, as being contrary to the law of God; and, by another, confirmed the king's marriage with Anne Boleyn, who was crowned on the first day of June.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="37" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Henry sent the lord Mountjoy to intimate these senten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es to Catherine, who still refused to submit; and the king ordered that, for the fu∣ture, she should have no other title than that of princess dowager of Wales. He likewise notified his divorce and new marriage to all the neighbouring prin∣ces; and, among the rest, to the emperor, by the mouth of Sir Thomas Wyat, who endeavoured to justify his majesty's conduct, and told the emperor, that the king of England hoped to find him his friend, as he had been heretofore. Charles received this intimation very coldly; and answered, that he would take the advice of his council, touching the measures he should pursue. The pope was incensed to the utmost degree of indignation at the sentence of Cranmer, and the book written by Henry against the papal authority; a copy of which had been already perused at Rome. He forthwith reversed the sentence; and declared, that the king himself deserved excommunication, unless he should, before the end of September, renounce all that had been done contrary to the authority of the holy see. Clement still hoped that some expedient might be found to reclaim Henry, who had gone too far to retract, but sent the duke of Norfolk, as his ambassador, to accompany Francis in his interview with the pope at Marseilles. That nobleman, while he resided in France, being informed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE> of the steps that were taken against his master at Rome, sent lord Rochford to Eng∣land for new instructions, and was himself immediately recalled. Neverthele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the king, at the desire of Francis, sent Stephen Gardiner, lately created bishop of Winchester, with Sir Francis Bryan, and Sir John Wallop, to attend him at the interview; and these were accompanied by Edmund Bonner, an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccle∣siastic of great impudence and resolution. After the celebration of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p∣tials at Marseilles, Francis prevailed upon the pope to satisfy the king of Eng∣land; but, in order to save the honour of the holy see, he insisted upon judging the cause in a consistory, from which the cardinals of the emperor's faction should be excluded. Bonner, who was ignorant of this resolution, demanded an audience of Clement, and gave him to understand that the king of England had ap∣pealed to a future council from any papal sentence that either was or might be given against him. The pope said he would take the advice of the cardinals; and, in a few days, told him that the appeal was not receivable: but Bonner, without being intimidated by this answer, proceeded to notify the appeal of the archbishop of Canterbury from the reversion of the sentence he had pro∣nounced; and his holiness was so incensed at Bonner's presumption, that he threatened to cause him to be thrown into a cauldron of molten lead. Francis likewise express<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his indignation at the Englishman's insolence, and promised

<P>Notwithstanding this intervention of Bonner, which, for the present, prevented the accommodation; Francis did not despair of seeing the dispo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e terminated in an amicable manner. On his return from Marseilles he sent John du Bellay, bishop of Paris, with new proposals to Henry, who con∣sented to the dispute's being terminated at Cambray, by judges who could not be suspected of partiality. The bishop, having gained this point, set out for Rome in the middle of winter, and found Clement very well disposed to agree to this expedient: but he insisted upon Henry's signing a writing, by which he should be bound to abide by this determination; and, in order to avoid delays, fixed a certain day for the return of the courier, who was dispatched to England for the instrument. The emperor's ministers were no sooner informed of this negotiation, than they pressed the pope to revoke his engagement; and, by dint of importunity, obtained his promise, that if the courier should not arrive within the limited time, he would hold himself disengaged, and give sentence against Henry. The messenger not appearing precisely within the time, the bishop of Paris sollicited a delay of six days only; but the pope was so much affected by the menaces of the Imperialists, that he would not comply with this request. On the contrary, he finished in one consistory, what, according to the usual forms, ought to have been canvassed in three. He published a sen∣tence, declaring the marriage of Henry with Catherine good and legitimate, and commanded that prince to take back his wife, on pain of occurring eccle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣astial censure. In two days after this decision the courier arrived from Eng∣land, with full power to the bishop of Paris to grant what the pope had de∣manded<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> and several cardinals advised him to revoke the sentence, but the emperor's parti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans prevailed upon him to reject the proposal.

Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>4.</NOTE> In all probability the king was not sincere in his proposals of ac∣commodation with Clement; for, even before he could know the issue of that negotiation, the parliament, meeting on the fifteenth day of January, began the session with an act, r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pealing the statute of Henry IV. against heretics. Not that the parliament intended to exempt them from the penalty; for, by the new law, they were condemned to the stake: but, in order to hinder the clergy from being sole judges in such cases, it was enacted that heretics should be tried ac∣cording to the laws of the kingdom, without any regard to the cannon law. By another act it was decreed, That no synod or convocation of the clergy should be held without the king's licence: That his majesty should appoint two and thirty persons from the parliament and the clergy, to examine the canons and constitutions of the church<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That those which were necessary should be preserved, and all the rest abolished. This parliament passed an act of attainder or conviction against Elizabeth Barton, known by the appellation of the maid of Kent, a native of the parish of Aldington, who was tutored by certain eccle∣siastics to exc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te disturbances in the kingdom. She had been troubled with hy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terical fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, during which she uttered many incoherent and delirious expres∣sions, which induced the ignorant by-standers to believe she was divinely in∣spired. Richard Master, the parish priest, foreseeing advantages to himself in trumping up an imposture, persuaded this weak fanatic that she actually spoke

from the inspiration of the Holy Ghost; taught her to counterfeit trances, and utter speeches which were deemed the oracles of heaven: he was assisted in this knavish design by one doctor Bocking, a canon of Christ-Church in Can∣terbury. Elizabeth, thus instructed, became an apt pupil; prophesied with all the marks of holy emotion, writhed her body into strange contorsions, in∣veighed against the favourers of the new doctrine as abominable hereties, ex∣claimed against the king's divorce; and, in order to raise the reputation of a chapel within the parish, declared that the Blessed Virgin had appeared to her, and assured her she would never recover until she should visit her image in that place of worship. She accordingly went in pilgrimage to the chapel; where, in the midst of an infinite concourse of people, she pretended to fall into a trance, poured forth pious ejaculations, declared that God had called her to a religious life, and appointed Bocking to be her ghostly father; she pretended to be recovered of all her distempers by the intercession of the Virgin; took the veil, saw visions, heard melody, received from Mary Magdalen a letter from heaven, was conveyed by an angel to Calais, while the king resided in that city, received the sacrament in his presence, though invisible; and was brought back again in the same manner to her own monastery. She prophesied that if Henry should proceed in the divorce, and marry another wife, his royalty would not be of a month's duration, but that he should die the death of a vil∣lain.</P>

<P>Her pretended revelations were collected and inserted in a book, by a monk called Deering. Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, a credulous though pious prelate, was imposed upon by her delusions: she was countenanced by Fisher bishop of Rochester, and others, who adhered to the interest of Cathe∣rine. They held private meetings with this diviner, and debauched many per∣sons from their allegiance, particularly the fathers and nuns of Sion, the Char∣ter-house, and Sheen, and some of the Observants of Richmond, Greenwich, and Canterbury. One Peto, preaching before the king at Greenwich, told him he had been deceived by many lying prophets; but he, as a true Micajah, warned him that the dogs should lick his blood, as they had licked the blood of Ahab. Henry bore this insult with great temper; but, to undeceive the people, appointed doctor Corren to preach before him on the ensuing sunday, when that ecclesiastic justified the king's proceedings, and branded Peto with the epithets of rebel, slanderer, dog, and traitor. He was interrupted by an Observant friar of the name of Ellston, who called him a lying prophet, that sought to establish the succession to the crown upon adultery. He spoke with such virulence that the king was obliged to interpose, and command him to hold his peace; and he and Peto were afterwards summoned before the coun∣cil, and rebuked for their intemperance. The ecclesiastics engaged this conspiracy, encouraged by the lenity of the government, had resolved to pub∣lish the revelations in their sermons throughout the kingdom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they had com∣municated them to the pope's ambassadors, to whom also they introduced the maid of Kent, and they exhorted queen Catherine to persist in her obstinacy. At length the confederacy began to be a very serious affair, and Henry ordered the maid and her accomplices to be examined in the Star-chamber; where they confessed all the particulars of the imposture, and appeared upon a scaffold in St. Paul's church, where the articles of their confession were publicly read, in

their hearing. From thence they were conveyed to the Tower, where they re∣mained till the meeting of the parliament, which having considered the case, pro∣nounced it a conspiracy against the king's life and crown; and the nun, with her accomplices, were attainted of high treason. The bishop of Rochester, Thomas Gold, Thomas Laurence, Edward Twai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, John Adison, and Tho∣mas Abell, were adjudged guilty of misprision of treason, to forfeit their goods and chattels to the king, and to be imprisoned during his majesty's pleasure; and the books of the nun's revelations were ordered to be sent to the secretary of state, on pain of fine and imprisonment. In the course of the inquiry they discovered that the letter said to come from Mary Magdalen, was written by one Hankberst of Canterbury; that the door of a dormitory said to have been opened by miracle that the nun might go into the chapel, and converse with God, was really opened for carnal communication between her and her accom∣plices. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE></P>

On the twentieth day of April, the maid of Kent, with Bocking, Master, Deering, Risby, and Gold, were executed at Tyburn, where the nun confessed her imposture, laying the blame upon the confederates, who had imposed upon her ignorance; she craved pardon of God and the king, and be sought the people<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</NOTE> to pray for her and her fellow-sufferers.

importing that they would be faithful to the king, queen, their heirs, and successors; that they held the king to be the supreme head of the English church, and the pope to be no more than any other bishop; that they renoun∣ced all obedience to that prelate; that they would preach the pure doctrines of the holy Scripture; and that they would publicly pray for the king as the head of the English church; for the queen, and the archbishop of Canterbury. This oath was voluntarily taken by the majority of all the abbots, priors, monks, and all the bishops, except Fisher; who, with Sir Thomas More, re∣fused to take it as it was then conceived. Sir Thomas declared he was willing to swear to the succession, provided he might be allowed to draw up an oath for himself. Cranmer and Cromwell expressed great tenderness for him; they endeavoured to convince him by arguments, and Cranmer proposed that his expedient should be accepted: but the king, being incensed against them, they were committed prisoners to the Tower, debarred the use of pen and paper; and Fisher was stripped of every thing in his old age, but a few rags which hardly covered his nakedness. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE></P>

<P>Henry, having in vain endeavoured to persuade Catherine to sub∣mission, began to apprehend some storm from her nephew the emperor, who had undertaken to execute the pope's sentence, and proposed to render his union with Francis still more intimate, for their common defence. That prince amused him with fair promises, but did not choose to contract any new con∣nexions, lest he should disoblige the pope, with whom he had been so lately allied. His chief aim was to recover Milan; and, in order to pave the way for repossessing himself of that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tchy, he endeavoured to detach Sforza from the interest of the emperor, who had restored him on very hard conditions, and was in his heart disaffected to the house of Austria. That the negotiation might be kept secret, it was carried on by one Merveille, a native of Milan, who had resided many years in France, and now returned to his native country with private credentials to Sforza, who received him as the French envoy. The emperor, being informed of this correspondence, threatened the duke in such a manner, that he resolved to sacrifice Merveille for his satisfaction. He hired a man to quarrel with this envoy; and the fray ending in the murder of the person thus employed, Merveille was imprisoned, convicted, and in two days beheaded. When Francis complained of this outrage offered to his ho∣nour in the person of his envoy, the duke denied that Merveille was in any public character: but the French king, using this as a pretext for invading the Milanese, assembled a body of troops, and demanded a passage through the territories of the duke of Savoy. That prince refusing his demand, he resolved to strip him of his dominions, to which he trumped up a claim in right of his mother Louisa; and, during his preparations for this war, pope Clement dying, was succeeded in the papacy by cardinal Farnese, who assumed the name of Paul III. In the course of this year, the landgrave of Hesse de∣feated the army of king Ferdinand, and re-established the duke of Wirtem∣berg in possession of his dominions: at length, Ferdinand was acknowledged as king of the Romans by the duke, the landgrave, and the elector of Saxony, in consideration of his giving his word, that no person in the empire should be molested on account of religion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idan.</NOTE></P>

<P>The parliament of England re-assembling on the twenty-third day of November, enacted several important laws, to destroy all future connexion between the king<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om and the pope. They confirmed the title of supreme head of the church, which the clergy had already bestowed upon the king. They declared all those who should speak, write, or imagine any thing to the prejudice of the king and queen, guilty of high treason. They deprived all such of the benefit of sanctuaries. They drew up a certain form of oath to be taken by subjects<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with regard to the succession of the crown, abolishing all former oaths on the same subject. They adjudged to the king the annates and first fruits, together with the tythe of all benefices. They established five and twenty suffragans to be chosen by the king, and to depend upon the bishops of the dioceses to which they should belong; and granted a general amnesty, from which, however, they excepted Fisher and More, who were, by a parti∣cular<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> act, declared guilty of misprision of treason. After the parliament broke up, the king published a proclamation to suppress the name of pope, and eraze it from all books and writing. All the prelates renounced obedience to the bishop of Rome, and, among the rest, Gardiner bishop of Winchester, tho' in his heart he detested the king's measures. By this time the reformation had made great progress in England as well as in Germany, notwithstanding the persecution which had been raised at the instigation of Sir Thomas More, while he occupied the office of chancellor. The treatises of Luther were well known to the subjects of Henry; and the Bible was translated into the English lan∣guage<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> by Tindal, who had withdrawn into the Low Countries. The bishop of London ordered some copies of this translation to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. Several persons were burned and suffered martyr∣dom with surprising constancy. These feverities, instead of extinguishing, served only to feed the flame of religious opposition, which was likewise in∣creased by the quarrel with the pope. The reformation was favoured by Anne Boleyn, archbishop Cranmer, and secretary Cromwell; but, at the same time, it had very powerful enemies in the persons of the duke of Norfolk, Gardiner, Longland bishop of Lincoln, and many other ecclesiastics who had access to court; and, in preaching before Henry, filled their sermons with invectives against the new doctrine. The king himself, though he had shaken off the papal yoke, was a bigotted catholic in every other respect; and, to his dying day, believed the real presence in the Sacrament. Besides, he had written a book against the doctrine of Luther, who had treated him in a scurrilous man∣ner; and though that reformer had afterwards humbled himself in a letter to Henry, he could never forgive the insolence of his first attack.</P>

<P>Although Henry had now trampled under foot the papal authority, conquered all opposition in his own dominions, reduced the earl of Kildare, who had rebelled in Ireland at the instigation of the emperor, and concluded a treaty of peace with his nephew James king of Scotland; he did not enjoy that tranquillity which he might have expected to reap from his success. He was embroiled by the disputes about religion, in which he acted such a part as was agreeable to neither side. He gave a loose to his passions, and became <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oisterous, cruel, and arbitrary. The monks having incensed him with per∣sonal abuse, he resolved, with the advice of his council, to execute the laws upon them without mercy. He was in particular exasperated against the new pope, who created Fisher a cardinal during his imprisonment, as a recompence for having denied the king's supremacy. The king, in order to shew his resent∣ment and contempt of the honour which the pope had bestowed, ordered the oath to be tendered once more to Fisher, who, refusing it as before, was con∣demned and executed as a traitor. He was a prelate of some learning, of an ex∣emplary life, great austerity, and devoted to the papal power. Sir Thomas More was inveigled by Rich, the sollicitor-general, into a conversation about the supremacy, which, joined to his former conviction of misprision of treason, was deemed a sufficient cause for taking his life away. He was accordingly condemned and decapitated, though the king reaped nothing but reproach from the death of a man who was universally esteemed for his integrity, and admired for his wit and facetious humour, which he exerted to the last moment of his life. He desired one of the by-standers to help him to mount the scaffold, say∣ing, he should not be so sollicitous about coming down again.

Thomas Cromwell, being chosen visitor-general, appointed substitutes for the examination of the monasteries, where they found such irregularities and scenes of vice, debauchery, and imposture, as were disgraceful to religion, and indeed shocking to human nature.

Henry, apprehensive that James king of Scotland, who he knew was disaffected to his person, would, notwithstanding the peace, take the first opportunity of invad∣ing England, if any civil commotion should arise, thought he could not find a more effectual method to secure himself from that quarter, than by persuad∣ing his nephew to follow his example, in renouncing the papal authority. For this purpose he wrote a long letter to that prince, explaining the reasons of his separating himself from the see of Rome; then he sent an ambassador to pro∣pose an interview. Though the reformation had gained footing in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.

Then he intimated this prohibition to his uncle, who having already made pre∣parations for his journey, was extremely incensed at the repulse, which pro∣duced a quarrel between the two monarchs.</P>

<P>In the beginning of the ensuing year, the unfortunate queen Catherine died at Kimbolton, after having sustained a long series of afflictions. She had been harrassed by repeated messages from Henry, importuning her to resign the title of queen, which she never would lay down, protesting, that as the pope had declared her marriage valid, she would sooner lose her life than her title, which she continued to exact from all her servants. She became, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1536.</NOTE> very affable, and acquired great popularity among the country people. When the king proposed, that she should reside at Fotheringay-Castle, she declared, she would never go thither unless as a prisoner. She lived on the pension assigned her as princess dowager of Wales; and though she could have no great comfort in England, where she was a stranger, she never discovered the least inclina∣tion to quit the kingdom, where, in all probability, she was detained by her mo∣therly care of the princess Mary. In her will<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she desired her body might be buried in a convent of Observant friars: that five hundred masses should be said for her soul: and, that a person should make a pilgrimage to our lady of Walsingham, and distribute two hundred nobles in charity upon the road: she likewise bequeathed some legacies to her servants. When the king heard of her illness, he sent her a kind message, and she dictated a very tender letter to
<PB N="616" REF="6280"/>
him, in which she called him her dear lord and husband; forgave him all the trouble in which be had involved her; recommended her daughter Mary to his care and affection; de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired he would provide for her three maids; indulge her servants with a small gratuity: and concluded with these words. <Q>“I make this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That mine eyes defire you above all things.”</Q> She was certainly a devout and virtuous princess, who led a severe and mortified life; but, she was a bigot in religion, and of a fretful disposition, which, in all probability, at first alienated the king's affection, as she had no personal charms to fix his na∣tural inconstancy. He expressed some regret at her death; but, would not allow her to be buried according to her own directions. Her body was interred<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> in the abbey church of Peterborough, which he afterwards converted into an episcopal cathedral. Queen Anne did not behave with due decorum on this occasion. She rejoiced openly at the decease of Catherine; and seemed to take pleasure in communicating her satisfaction to the public.</P>

<P>The parliament had impowered the king to nominate two and thirty persons, to make a collection of ecclesiastical constitutions; and now that act was confirmed. The king represented to the parliament in this session, that the great number of monasteries was an expence to the kingdom, and desired them to apply some remedy to this evil: in consequence of which remonstrance, they passed an act, suppressing all monasteries, whose revenues did not exceed two hundred pounds; and appropriated their income for his majesty's use. By this law the crown acquired the yearly value of two and thirty thousand pounds, besides a capital of above one hundred thousand pounds, on the plate, ornaments, and effects of churches and convents. Then he erected a new court of justice, called the Court of the augmentation of the king's re∣venue, for taking cognizance of all such sequestrations. The clergy met in convocation, proposed, that a new translation of the Bible into the English lan∣guage should be made, and published for the sake of those who did not under∣stand Latin; and though this motion was vehemently opposed by Gardiner, and his party, Cranmer carried his point. The king was petitioned to employ some capable persons to translate the Scriptures; the queen seconded the petition, with which Henry complied; and though we know not who the translators were, the work was in three years printed at Paris. Henry having obtained all he wished from the parliament, dissolved that assembly, after it had conti∣nued sitting six years, a longer term than parliament had ever subsisted since the beginning of the English monarchy.</P>

<P>By this time, Sforza duke of Milan being dead without issue, the dutchy devolved to the emperor, who perceiving Francis bent upon the con∣quest of that country, and supposing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he would not embark in such an under∣taking, without the promise of assistance from the king of England, resolved, if possible, to disunite those two potentates. He set on foot a private negotia∣tion with the king of France; and proposed to cede the dutchy of Milan to one of that monarch's sons. At the same time, hearing of queen Catherine's death, he offered to renew his alliance with Henry, on condition, that the king of Eng∣land would be reconciled to the pope through his mediation; that he would furnish him with powerful succours against the Turks; and assist him in de∣fending Milan from the attacks of Francis. To these proposals Henry replied, that the measures he had taken against the pope could not be recalled; that he
<PB N="617" REF="6290"/>
should always be ready to act as became a christian prince, against <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ssdels: that he was willing to renew the alliance with the emperor, provided it could be done without prejudice to his ally the king of France; and the emperor would own, that he himself had been the cause of the rupture. Henry plainly perceived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert.</NOTE> that the design of Charles was to detach him from the interests of France, with∣out any intention to renew the alliance with England. Francis had given him to understand, that Charles intended to compel him by force of arms to acknowledge the pope's supremacy: for which purpose he sollicited the assist∣ance of Francis; and, on that condition offered to cede the Milane<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. The king of England being thus apprized of the emperor's intentions, conti∣nued his negotiation with the protestants of Germany, in order to find him work in his own dominions. He had already sent Edward Fox as his envoy to the league of Smalcalde; and the members of that association agreed to unite their interests with his, on condition, that he would subscribe the confes∣sion of Augsburg, and defend it with all his power in a free council, which should be held in a place chosen for the purpose, with their consent: that if the pope should insist upon assembling a council, according to his own pleasure, Henry should join them in their protestations against it, and assu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the title o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Protector of the league: that he should never acknowledge the pope's supre∣macy, or give the least assistance to their enemies: that he should supply the league with one hundred thousand crowns for their present occasions, and furnish double that sum, in case the war should continue: and they declared, that as soon as he should have agreed to these articles, they would send ambassadors to England, to bring the treaty to perfection. Henry had no intention to sub∣scribe the confession of Augsburg; but as it was his interest to protract the ne∣gotiation, he gave them to understand, that the money should be furnished as soon as they could agree about the other articles: that he had no objection to the title of Protector; but, could not profess the faith of Augsburgh, until his conscience could be satisfied of the truth of that confession; for which purpose, he desired to be better informed of their particular doctrines. They forthwith nominated Sturmius, Draco, Melanchthon, and Bucerus, to confer with Henry and his theologians; but they were forbid to come to any conclusion that might be prejudicial to the emperor or empire.</P>

<P>This treaty was interrupted by an event equally surprizing in itself, and interesting to the favourers of the reformation. Henry began to be cloyed with the possession of Anne Boleyn, who had lately been delivered of a dead male child, to the unspeakable disappointment of her husband, who was superstitious enough to believe this accident was a judgment from heaven. He was about this time captivated with the beauty of Jane Seymour, one of the queen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s la∣dies; and his passions were so strong and impetuous, that he sacrificed every thing to their gratification. These concurring motives for his alienation from the queen, were strengthened by his wife's deportment, which was too frank and unguarded, to screen her from the imputation of levity and indiscretion. Her ene∣mies, in particular the duke of Norfolk, and all those who had adhered to the old religion, took advantage of this disposition, to inflame the king's jea∣lousy; the principal fomenter of which was the lady Rochford, sister-in-law to queen Anne, a woman of an infamous character, who hated her mistress
<PB N="618" REF="6300"/>
with the most envenomed rancour. She hinted to the king that his wife carried on a criminal correspondence with her own brother the lord Rochford: and Henry's mind being prepared for this poison, by his disgust for Anne, and his new pas∣sion for Jane Seymour, it operated with great violence. The insinuations of the lady Rochford were confirmed by the duke of Norfolk, who enjoyed a great share of the king's confidence, and was devoted to the popish religion, which could not flourish while queen Anne lived to countenance the reforma∣tion. The partisans of the pope therefore conspired her ruin. She was not only accused of incest with her brother Rochford, but likewise of living in carnal commerce with Henry Norris, groom of the stole, Westo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eton, of the king's privy chamber, and Mark Smeton a musician. There was no other evidence than an hearsay declaration of one lady Wingfield, who confessed some particulars on her death-bed: but, this was sufficient to ruffle such a mind as that of Henry, who is said to have observed Anne, at a tournament in Greenwich, drop her handkerchief to one of her minions, that he might wipe his face, after having overheated himself in the exercise. Be that as it may, the king returned abruptly to Whitehall; Anne was confined to her chamber; and the suspected delinquents being apprehended at the same time, were com∣mitted to the Tower. Anne smiled at first, thinking the king was in jest; but, when she found it was a very serious affair, she received the sacrament in her closet, and prepared for death. This reverse of fortune affected her in such a manner, that she was seized with hysteric fits, during which she laughed and wept by turns; and uttered many inconsistencies, according to the nature of that disease. Next day, she was conveyed to the Tower, where she fell upon her knees, and appealed to God for the knowledge of her innocency. She in vain, begged to be admitted into the presence of the king. The lady Boleyn, her uncle's wife, who had always hated her, was ordered to be in the same chamber with her; and she made a report of all the incoherent ravings of the afflicted prisoner. She was visited by the duke of Norfolk, and some of the king's council, who endeavoured to draw her into a confession, by saying she was accused by Norris and Smeton: but, she still persisted in denying the charge; and told the lieutenant of the Tower, she was not more guilty with any man upon earth, than with himself. She confessed indeed, that she had, in the gaiety of her heart, made use of some indiscreet expressions to Smeton and Weston; and the familiarity of her behaviour had encouraged them to hint a passion for her, which, in all probability, afforded her matter of laughter and amusement; and perhaps, the knowlege of those frivolous circumstances in∣creased the king's jealousy and indignation.</P>

<HEAD>§ LIV.</HEAD>
<P>Every person at court abandoned the unhappy queen in her distress, except Cranmer, who, though forbid to come into the king's presence, wrote a letter to him in behalf of Anne Boleyn; but, his intercession had no effect. On the twelfth day of May, Norris, Weston, Brereton, and Smeton, were tried in Westminster-Hall; when Smeton confessed he had known the queen carnally three times; but, he was supposed to have been inveigled into this confession with a promise of pardon. The other three pleaded not guilty; but, all four were convicted and condemned to die the death of traitors. On the fifteenth day of the month, the queen, and her brother lord Rochford, were brought to
<PB N="619" REF="6310"/>
their trial, before the duke of Norfolk, as lord high steward for the occasion, the duke of Suffolk, the marquis of E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter, the earl of Arundel, and five and twenty other peers. The queen appearing at the bar, was charged with criminal conversation with her brother, and the other four; as also with hav∣ing conspired the king's death. She pleaded not guilty, and answered distinctly all the evidence that was produced against her. As she was not confronted by Smeton, in all probability he had bore false witness; for, all the others denied the charge. Nevertheless, she was convicted and condemned to be burned or beheaded, at the king's pleasure. Her brother likewise was found guilty, and sentenced to be beheaded and quartered. The king, not satisfied with this ven∣geance, was desirous of seeing her daughter Elizabeth declared illegitimate. He remembered a report of a previous contract, between lord Piercy, now earl of Northumberland, and Anne Boleyn. The earl being questioned on this subject, declared, that no such contract had ever subsisted. He swore to this declara∣tion on the sacrament, which he wished might be his damnation if he did not speak the truth. Nevertheless, Anne was tampered with in such a manner, either by promise of life, or threats of executing the sentence in all its rigour, that she confessed such a precontract, at Lambeth, before the afflicted archbi∣shop of Canterbury, and some other persons of distinction; and her marriage with the king was declared null and insufficient. This sentence, however, palpably contradicted the other which had been pronounced against her; for, if her marriage with Henry was null from the beginning, she could not be justly attainted for adultery. In two days after this declaration, she was or∣dered to be executed in the green on Tower-Hill; and behaved with great piety, resignation, and good humour. She is said to have written a letter to the king, when she first understood the cause of her confinement. Such an ad∣dress was afterwards found among the papers of Cromwell, drawn up with such pathetic eloquence and dignity of expression, as do great honour to the author; but it is generally suspected to have been written by another hand. On the day that preceded the execution, she desired the wife of the lieutenant of the Tower to sit down in the chair of state; then kneeling before her, and shedding a flood of tears, she conjured her to go, in her name, and ask pardon of the princess Mary, for the harshness with which she had been treated. On the morning of her execution she sent for the lieutenant, that he might be present at her receiv∣ing the sacrament, and declaring her own innocence. She said, she was sorry to hear her execution was delayed till the afternoon, because, before that time, she had expected to be out of her pain. Then she inquired about the dexterity of the executioner; fixed her hands about her neck, observing, that she had a very little neck, and laughing heartily. When she was brought to the scaffold, in presence of the dukes of Suffolk and Richmond, the lord chancellor, the secre∣tary Cromwell, with the lord mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs of London, she said she was come to die, as she had been judged by the law. She prayed God would preserve the king, who had been always to her a most merciful, good, and gentle sovereign; and desired, that people would judge of him with cha∣rity. She took leave of all the spectators, desiring they would pray for her; and after she had spent some time in devotion, her head was severed from her body by the executioner of Calais, who was brought over for his dexterity in
<PB N="620" REF="6320"/>
performing that operation. Her body was thrown into a common chest, and buried in the Tower-chapel without any ceremony. Her brother, with the other convicts, were beheaded, except Smeton, who was hanged. Norris was promised to be forgiven, if he would confess his guilt, and accuse the queen. But, he rejected the proposal with disdain, saying, in his conscience he thought her free of the crimes laid to her charge; and would rather die a thousand times, than ruin an innocent person. Thus fell Anne Boleyn, whose fate has been the subject of much controversy. She seems to have been a lady of unaffected piety, and a very charitable disposition; though she had by her education in France, contracted a kind of vivacity that did not suit the manners of an English court. She was naturally volatile, and in some cases child∣ishly<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> indiscreet: so that, in all probability, her heart was better than her under∣standing. She encouraged learning and genius, distributed great sums in alms; and died a sacrifice to the jealousy and intemperance of Henry, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nflamed by the malicious suggestions of those who were enemies to the reformation, which she in a particular manner patronized.</P>

<P>Nothing justified Anne Boleyn so much as the conduct of the king, who on the very day that succeeded her execution, married Jane Seymour; so little regard did he pay to common decorum, and the opinion of his subjects, over whom he had by this time acquired the most despotic authority. The princess Mary, who had been harshly used by her father, on account of her at∣tachment to her mother, and her obstinate refusal to conform to the statutes which had been lately enacted, was advised by her friends to sue for a reconcia∣tion with the king at this juncture, when her sister Elizabeth was declared ille∣gitimate. She accordingly wrote a very submissive letter to him, imploring his forgiveness for her former obstinacy; and promising for the future to obey him in all his directions. Henry, before he would readmit her into his favour, insisted upon her subscribing the act of supremacy, the renunciation of the bishop of Rome, and the invalidity of her mother's marriage. Mary used all her endeavours to be excused from a submission of this nature; but seeing the king inflexible, at length complied, and signed the articles, which were contrary to her conscience and persuasion. Elizabeth being in the fourth year of her age, was deprived of the title of Princess of Wales, which she had hitherto enjoyed; but Henry carefully superintended her education, and treated her on all occasions with parental affection.</P>

<P>A new parliament being assembled on the eighth day of June, enacted a statute reversing the former act of succession, declaring the children of the king's two first marriages illegitimate, and excluded for ever from the succes∣sion to the crown; confirming the condemnation of Anne Boleyn, adjudg∣ing the crown, after the king's death, to his issue by queen Jane, or any other wife he might afterwards espouse; impowering his majesty to regulate the manner in which they should succeed, either by will, or letters patent under the great seal; and declaring all those who should maintain the validity of his first marriages, guilty of high treason. Pope Paul III. when he was in∣formed of Anne's fate, began to conceive hopes of seeing all that had been done against the papal power in England, revoked; and conferred with Casali on this subject. But, times were greatly altered since Henry discovered the least
<PB N="621" REF="6330"/>
tendency to an accommodation with the see of Rome. He had now made himself absolute with the clergy as well as laity of his dominions; and he had no mind to part with any portion of his authority. In order to deprive the pope of all chance for retrieving his spiritual jurisdiction in England, this parliament passed an act, subjugating to the penalty of Premunire, all those who should in any manner attempt to re-establish in England the authority of the bishop of Rome; and all magistrates who should neglect to put this law in execution. By another statute, they annulled and abolished all dispensations, exemptions, and privileges, derived from the court of Rome, saving, however, to the archbishop of Canterbury, the power of confirming what should be judged for the benefit of the church and people. A third prohibited marriage with any of the king's relations, unless permission should be previously granted. This act was passed in consequence of a stolen match between Thomas Howard brother to the duke of Norfolk, and Margaret Douglas the king's niece, who, together with her husband was confined in the Tower for this presumption. A fourth law decreed, That all usurpation of parliament upon the king's authority, before he should have attained the age of four and twenty, might be annulled by letters patent under the great seal of England. In a word, one would imagine, that this parliament had met with no other view than that of extending the royal prero∣gative beyond the bounds within which it had been hitherto confined. Nor did the clergy yield to the parliament in this kind of slavish complaisance. The con∣vocation confirmed the sentence of divorce between the king and Anne Boleyn, upon the supposed precontract subsisting between that lady and the lord Percy, though this nobleman had denied it upon oath in the most solemn manner.</P>

<P>The lower house of convocation being averse to Cranmer, Crom∣well, and those who favoured the reformation, and supposing that the persons whom Anne protected would now be involved in her ruin, sent to the upper house sixty-seven propositions, which they deemed heretical. At the same time, their deputies complained loudly against innovations in religion, and those by whom they were introduced, meaning Cranmer, Cromwel, Shaxton, and Latimer. They had, in their propositions, inserted many doctrines adopted by the Lutherans, antient Lollards, and Anabaptists, insinuating, that the reformers professed them all equally. But, they were baffled in their expectation: Cran∣mer and Cromwell still maintained their places in Henry's favour, and the latter was created king's vicegerent in all ecclefiastical affairs. By Henry's order, he declared to the convocation, That the rites and cremonies of the church should be reformed by the rules of Scripture; and in a few days, he pre∣sented to them a set of articles drawn up by the king himself, touching the reli∣gious doctrines, that the convocation might examine them, and make a faith∣ful report of their de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iberations on the subject. In this debate, the friends and enemies of the reformation declared themselves openly. Cranmer was seconded by Goodrick bishop of Ely, Shaxton of Salisbury, Latimer of Worcester, Bar∣low of St. David's, Fox of Hereford, and Hilsey of Rochester. At the head of the other party was Lee archbishop of York, supported by Stokesley of Lon∣don, Tonstal of Durham, Gardiner of Winchester, Longland of Lincoln, Sher∣burn of Chichester, Nix of Norwich, and Kite of Carlisle. These were secret partisans of the pope, with whom they hoped a reconciliation would one day

After warm debates, the convocation agreed to certain articles reduced into the form of constitutions, importing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That the Holy Scripture was the foundation of faith, together with the creed of the Apo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tles, the Nicene, and that of Athanasius: That baptism was absolutely neces∣sary, as well as penitence, comprehended in the three acts of contrition, auricular confession, and amendment of life: That the real body of Christ was present in the eucharist: That justification was acquired by regeneration, in contrition, faith, and charity: That images ought to be preserved in churches; but, that the worship should not be payed to the image, but to God himself: That the saints ought to be honoured, though without believing that they could grant what was in the gift of God alone: That they might nevertheless be invoked, without superstition, and their festivals observed; but, that some of these might be retrenched by the king's authority: That the customary ceremonies of the church should be retained; such as the priest's ornaments, holy water, consecrated bread, tapers on Candlemas-day, ashes on Ash-Wednesday, palms on Palm∣Sunday, prostrations before the cross on Good-Friday, hallowings of the font, exorcisms, and benedictions: That prayers should be put up for departed souls, and alms given for masses and exequies; but, as the place they were in, and the pains they suffered, had not been ascertained by scripture, they ought to be re∣mitted wholly to God's mercy: That the ridiculous notions of purgatory<NOTE PLACE="marg">L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

Before the convocation broke up, the king imparted to the two houses, a citation he had received to a council, which the pope, in concert with the em∣peror, had assembled at Mantua. The clergy having deliberated upon this subject, declared, That neither the pope, nor any prince upon earth, had power to convoke a general council without the consent of all the sovereigns in Chri∣stendom. Henry, satisfied with this decision, published a protest against the council of Mantua, declaring he could not look upon that as a free council, which was assembled in a suspected place, where the bishop of Rome presided, and which could not be composed of any great number of prelates, during th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> war between France and the emperor.</P>

<P>About this time, Reginald Pole rendered himself universally famous for his taste and learning. He was descended from the duke of Clarence, and consequently related to the king, who resolved to raise him to the highest dig∣nities of the church, bestowed upon him the deanery of Exeter, and sent him to finish his studies at Paris. He refused to concur with Henry's agents in procuring the subscriptions and seals of the French universities, in favour of the divorce, which he himself disapproved. He afterwards returned to England, and concurred with the clergy in acknowledging Henry supreme head of the

church. Then he made a voyage to Padua, where he distinguished himself by his wit and eloquence, above all his cotemporaries; and contracted an in∣timacy of friendship with the most eminent men and writers of that country. The king understanding, that he openly condemned him for his separation from the apostolic see, sent to him a book written by doctor Sampson in defence of his proceedings. To this performance Pole wrote an answer, intituled De unio∣ne ecclesi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stica, in which he reprehended the king in very severe terms, com∣paring him to Nebuchadono<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or; and conjuring the emperor to turn his arms against him, rather than against any other infidel.

<P>The suppression of the small monasteries, though decreed in the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t session of the parliament, did not take place till the month of August, when it produced great mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>murs among the people. Many persons of distinction were dissatisfied at seizing the effects of those monasteries which their ancestors had founded. They saw themselves deprived of a great convenience which they enjoyed, while they could provide for their younger children in those convents; besides that of being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ospitably entertained by the abbots and priors, when they had occasion to travel through the country. The poor had still greater reason to complain, because they lived upon the alms daily distributed by those reli∣gious houses; and superstitious people lamented, that the souls of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iends would now continue in purgatory, since the prayers for the dead were abolished by the suppression of monasteries. In order to appease these dis∣contents, the king, by the advice of Cromwell, sold the lands of the sup∣pressed monasteries at a low price, on condition that the purchasers should main∣tain the practice of hospitality; and he re-established one and thirty convents, for the further satisfaction of the people: but even this condescension failed to produce the desired effect, though it reconciled many lay gentlemen to the measures which had been taken. Yet, what the king gained by this expedient, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e lost by another step, namely, that of publishing, in the name of his vicege∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, a set of injunctions for regulating the lives and conduct of ecclesiastics. This was the first pure act of the king's supremacy; for, in all the preceding <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ansactions, he had the concurrence of the convocation. The clergy now looked upon themselves as slaves to a vicegerent. The great advantage they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed to make by their images, relics, and pilgrimages, was taken away by these injunctions. They were loaded with severe impositions; a fifth part of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>venues was deducted for repairs; a tenth for exhibitioners, whom they were obliged to maintain; and a fortieth for charity: their labour was increased, and they were restrained to a life of severity. The secular clergy thus hampered, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oncurred with the regulars, in diffusing a spirit of discontent among the peo∣ple; and they were secretly encouraged by the great abbots, who trembled at the dissolution of the lesser monasteries, on the supposition that their houses would meet with the same fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>

They intreated the king to assemble the nobility of the nation, and consult them touching these grievances; and they concluded with acknow∣ledging him as supreme head of the church, to whom the tithes and first fruits of all livings justly belonged. The king published a very severe answer to this remonstrance, following the first dictates of his passionate temper and imperious disposition; and sent Charles Brandon duke of Suffolk against them, at the head of some forces. Though his answer served only to inflame the multitude, several persons of distinction entered into a private negotiation with the duke, assuring him, they had joined the revolters for no other purpose but to bring them by degrees to a sense of their duty; and that, if the king would indulge them with an amnesty, they would soon disperse without bloodshed. The duke wrote to the king on this subject; and Henry being informed of another in∣surrection in Yorkshire, published an amnesty in favour of the revolters of Lin∣colnshire, who disbanded accordingly, though some of the number joined the rebe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lion in the county of York, which was much more dangerous than the other, because the eff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct of premeditation, and encouraged by many persons of con∣sequence.

<P>The earl of Shrewsbury armed his vassals to oppose their progress; and was created king's lieutenant against the rebels; while the duke of Suf∣folk was ordered to remain in Lincolnshire to hinder any fresh commotion in that county. Several noblemen were commissioned to levy forces, and the king himself began to assemble an army to be commanded by the duke of Norfolk. During these preparations, Aske reduced the castle of Pontefract, into which the archbishop of York and the lord Darcy had thrown themselves. He af<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erwards made himself master of Hull and York, and obliged all the nobility of those parts to join his army.

to the herald, in consideration of his office. He required Henry Clifford, earl of Cumberland, to surrender his castle of Skipton, and join his forces; but that nobleman refused to comply with his demand, although he was forsaken by five hundred gentlemen, whom he retained at his own expence. Then the rebels besieged Sir Ralph Ewers in the castle of Scarborough, which he gal∣lantly defended; though he and his garrison tasted no other food for twenty∣four days but simple bread and water. Henry, seeing this affair become every day more and more serious, sent the duke of Norfolk and the marquis of Exeter, with some troops levied in haste, to join the earl of Shrewsbury; but, even after the junction, they were not able to face the enemy, who advanced against them to the number of thirty thousand men; and, in all probability, would have attacked them at Doncaster, had not the river been so swelled by heavy rains that they could not ford it, and the bridge so strongly fortified, that they had no prospect of carrying it by assault.</P>

<P>The duke of Norfolk, who favoured them in his heart, was not sorry to find himself unable to attack them: he maintained a private intel∣ligence with some of their chiefs, and, by his advice, they presented <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n humble petition to the king, which the duke engaged to deliver, and support with his interest; but, in the mean time, he insisted upon a cessation of hostilities, to which they agreed. Perceiving however that Henry, instead of answering their petition, endeavoured to sow division among them by his emissaries, they resolved to attack his army without further delay; but were once more pre∣vented by the rain, which rendered the river impassable. Then the king pro∣posed they should send three hundred deputies to meet his commissioners at Doncaster; and the duke of Norfolk returning to that place, gave them to understand he had procured an amnesty in their favour, from which however ten were excepted; six of these by name, and the other four to be pitched upon by his majesty. This indulgence they rejected, but sent their three hundred deputies to Do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>caster; and as they knew the king's intention was to gain time by protracting the negotiation, and that he hoped such a number of deputies would not agree among themselves, they furnished them with instructions in writing, containing certain proposals, from which they were not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t liberty to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ede.

<P>While these events engrossed the attention of the English monarch, a new rupture happe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed between the emperor and the king of France. Charles, on his return from Africa, continued to amuse Francis with a negotiation; in∣sinuating that he would cede the dutchy of Milan in favour of his third son, the duke of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gouleme, on certain conditions: but, as he wavered in his pro∣posals, Francis ordered his general to suspend all hostilities in Piedmont, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent the cardi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al of Lorrain, as his ambassador, to demand a categorical answer of the emperor, who had repaired to Rome. There, in a public consistory, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e declaimed against the king of France as the sole author of all the wars which had afflicted Europe <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince his accession to the throne; and observed, that, instead of shedding so much innocent blood, he would have acted more like a christian prince in deciding the quarrel with Charles by a sword and poignard, in some boat or island. Next day, the French ambassador desired to know if his intention was to challenge his master to single combat; but he re∣plied in the negative, saying, his meaning was that the French king ought to have accepted the expedient when it was first proposed. The cardinal soon perceived that Charles had no intention to bestow the dutchy of Milan on a prince of the house of France; and wrote to Francis that he had nothing to expect but war from the emperor. He had already projected the scheme of an invasion against France, and began to assemble three armies; one to act in Piedmont under his own command, another in Picardy, and a third in Cham∣pagne. Francis, being apprised of his design, recalled the greatest part of his troops from P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edmont, after having left strong garrisons in Turin and the other places he had conquered. The French forces had no sooner quitted Piedmont than Charles invested Turin, and, during the siege, entered Pro∣vence at the head of a numerous army; while Francis, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ving provided for the defence of Marseilles, ordered two camps to be fortified, one at Cavaillon, under the command of the marechal de Montmorency, and the other at Valence, where he was made acquainted with the death of his eldest son the dauphin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ay.

In the mean time, the count de Nassau fell into Picardy with thirty thousand men, took Guise by assault, and besieged Peronne, which was relieved by the duke of Guise.

<P>England was still agitated by the remains of the last storm in the North. The king had no intention to keep his word with the rebels; but or∣dered the duke of Norfolk to continue in arms among them, to be a check upon their conduct, and to exact the oath of supremacy, which was ad∣ministered

to persons of all ranks and conditions. Aske was ordered to repair to court, where he at first met with a civil reception; but the lord Darcy was sent to the Tower as soon as he arrived at London. The discontents among the people of the North soon broke out again in open rebellion: two gentle∣men, called Musgrave and Tilby, putting themselves at the head of eight thousand malecontents, made an attempt upon Carlisle; from whence they were repulsed, and afterwards entirely routed by the duke of Norfolk. Mus∣grave escaped; but Tilby, with seventy of his followers, were taken and hanged upon the walls of Carlisle. Another body, commanded by Sir Francis Bigot, and one Hullam, endeavoured to surprise Hull, but were also taken and ex∣ecuted. These enterprizes exasperated the ferocious temper of the king to such a degree, that he commanded Aske and the lord Darcy to be put to death, on pretence of a conspiracy, for which likewise the lord Hussey and many persons of distinction suffered, notwithstanding the amnesty which had been granted. The lord Darcy, during his imprisonment, accused the duke of Norfolk of having favoured the rebels at Doncaster. The duke denied the charge, which he imputed to malice, and offered to clear himself by single combat; but the king, whether convinced of his innocence, or unwilling to deal severely with such a powerful nobleman, declared himself satisfied with his conduct. By this time Henry's disposition was so savaged that he became terrible to his subjects: not satisfied with the blood he had shed, he ordered Thomas Fitzgerald, son to the earl of Kildare, and five of his uncles, who had surrendered to lord Grey on promise of pardon, and been long detained in prison, to be hanged at Ty∣burn; but the younger son of Kildare escaped by being packed up in a bundle of cloaths, and was conveyed to Ireland, from whence he sailed to France; and, finding himself unsafe in that kingdom, took refuge with cardinal Pole, who was his kinsman, and received him with great hospitality. The king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

<P>On the twelfth day of October, the queen was delivered at Hamp∣ton-court of a prince, who was christened by the name of Edward; and, tho' the mother died in two days after the birth, Henry was overjoyed at this event, which not only gratified his vanity, but removed all doubts about the succession. In six days after this child was born, the king created him prince of Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polyd. Vergil.</NOTE> duke of Cornwall, and earl of Chester. At the same time, the queen's brother, Sir Edward Seymour, lately made lord Beauchamp, was created earl of Hert∣ford; Sir William Fitzwilliams honoured with the title of earl of Southamp∣ton; in the month of March, Sir William Paulet, treasurer of the houshold, was created lord St. John; and Sir John Russel, comptroller, dignified with the title of lord Russel. In the course of this year, James V, of Scotland, in his return from France with his young queen, touching on the coast of England, had been sollicited by a great number of the natives to take up arms against the tyrant Henry; but he declined embracing their proposals, and arrived at Edinburgh, where his queen soon died of an hectic fever: then he sent am∣bassadors to France to demand in marriage Mary, sister of the duke of Guise, and cardinal of Lorrain, whom he actually espoused in the sequel.

The counci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, convoked at Mantua, was a step directly contrary to the promise Charles had made of assembling one in Germany: and the Lutherans complained of this breach of promise, refusing to submit to the decisions of a council in which the pope presided. The emperor, whose scheme was to crush them by force of arms<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> endeavoured to amuse them with delusive answers, until he should be in a condition to declare his designs. That he might be enabled to execute it with the fairer prospect of success, he concluded a truce with Fran∣cis, and negotiated for a peace, in hope of detaching the French king from<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> the league of Smalcalde. Mean while the pope, postponing the opening of the council from May to November, directed the cardinals Contarini, Sadolet, Polus, and Bembo, to enquire into such abuses of the church as required re∣formation.

<P>Henry had been so provoked by the ill offices of the monks, who stirred up the late insurrections, that he resolved to suppress all the monas∣teries in England, without exception; his resolution being in this particular in∣fluenced by his interest as well as resentment, for he already grasped in idea the rents and riches of all the convents and religious houses. To pave the way for this total dissolution, he ordered another minute visitation, that he might be able to remove the prejudices of the people, by divulging the enormities committed in those receptacles of vice; and such scenes were brought to light,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> as could not fail to excite the surprize and abhorrence of the public. A great number of monks, and even some abbots and priors, were convicted of holding correspondence with the rebels, and executed as traitors. Many compromised for their lives, by resigning their houses into the king's hands; some gave up their monasteries from motives of conscience; others to avoid punishment and disgrace; but all of them received pensions for their subsistence. Had nothing appeared against those religious foundations but the vice and profligacy of the abbots, abbesses, nuns, and friars, the people would have naturally thought that the institution, which was good in itself, ought not to have been abolished, for the corruption of the members, who might have been changed and re∣formed. But the king chose a more effectual expedient, in opening the eyes of the people with respect to the pretended sanctity of relics, images, and all the other trumpery of superstition. The visitors were instructed to examine, and, if possible, discover the arts by which the minds of the vulgar were infatuated; and then the whole machinery of monkish imposture was detected: not but that the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andalous vices practised in convents were likewise pub∣lished, in order to undeceive the nation. The impurities of Sodom and Go∣morrah are said to have been exceeded in Battel-abbey, Christ-church in Can∣terbury, and several other convents. They found innumerable instances of whoredom, adultery, onanism, and other unnatural lusts and beastly practices; with arts to prevent conception, and procure abortion among the nuns who were debauched. With respect to monkish idolatry and deceit, Reading seems to have been the repository of the nation. There the visiters found an angel with one wing, that brought over the head of the spear that pierced the side of
<PB N="629" REF="6410"/>
Jesus Christ, with such an inventory of other relics as filled up four sheets of paper. At St. Edmundsbury they seized some of the coals that roasted St. Laurence, the parings of St. Edmund's toes, the penknife and boots of St. Thomas Becket, a great quantity of the real cross, and certain relics to prevent rain and the generation of weeds among corn. The house of Westacre had pawned a finger of St. Andrew for forty pounds; but this the visitors did not think proper to redeem. There was a crucifix at Boxely in Kent, distinguished by the appeliation of the Rood of Grace, which had been long in reputation, because it had been seen to bend and raise itself, shake the head, hands, and feet, roll the eyes, and move the lips. This puppet, being brought to Lon∣don, was broke in pieces in sight of the people at St. Paul's cross, where, with their own eyes they saw the springs by which it had been actuated. At Hales in Gloucestershire the monks had carried on a profitable traffic with the blood of Christ in a chrystal vial: sometimes this blood appeared, and sometimes was invisible, according to the faith or holiness of the spectator. This relic was no other than the blood of a duck renewed weekly, and put in a vial; one side of which was thin and transparent, and the other thick and impervious to the rays of light: it was placed near the altar, so as to be turned occasionally by those spiritual jugglers, according to the bounty of the pilgrim, or votary, by whom it was adored. The visitor for Wales sent up to London a huge image of wood called Dawel Gatheren, to which incredible numbers of pil∣grims resorted, on the supposition that it had power to deliver souls from hell. This idol served for fuel to burn friar Forrest in Smithfield; and another famous image of our Lady at Worcester, was found to be the statue of a bishop, disguised with veils and other ornaments. Another, in the bishopric of St. David's, with a taper which was said to have continued burning nine years, with many rich shrines belonging to our Lady of Walsingham, of Ipswich, and of Islington, were committed to the flames by order of the vicegerent. That of St. Thomas Becket at Canterbury excelled all the others in magnificence, and opinion of sanctity: vast numbers of pilgrims resorted to it from all quar∣ters, and even preferred it to those of Christ and the Blessed Virgin; for, in one year, the offerings at the altar of Christ and his mother did not exceed four pounds; and those at the shrine of St. Thomas amounted to nine hundred and fifty-four. Lewis VII. of France had visited and presented at it a jewel that was deemed the richest in Europe. Not contented with one festival in the year, they kept the anniversary of his translation as an holiday; and, in every fiftieth year, there was a jubilee for fifteen days, during which, indul∣gences were granted to all that came to visit his shrine. The skull, which they worshipped as the saint's, had never belonged to him; for the true skull was found lying in the grave with the rest of his bones. The shrine was now broken down and carried away, together with the gold that adorned it, which filled two large chests that eight strong men could hardly carry out of the church. The king ordered his bones to be burned, his name expunged from the calendar, and the office for his festival to be struck out of the breviary. A convocation meeting took into consideration the articles which had been pub∣lished in the preceding year, and given great offence; and, at the conclusion of their session, they printed an explanation of the Creed, the seven Sacraments,
<PB N="630" REF="6420"/>

<P>When Henry's proceedings were known at Rome, that city was filled with satires and libels against his person and conduct. He was branded as the most infamous and sacrilegious tyrant that ever existed. They accused him of violating the ashes of the dead, which even the heathens had revered; with waging war against heaven and the saints; with sacrificing consecrated priests to his savage cruelty and revenge; with pilfering all that the devotion<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert.

They compared him to Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hazar, Nero, Domitian, Dioclesian, and especially to Julian the apostate, whom he resembled in his learning and apostacy, though he fell short of him in his morals. Henry had spies at Rome, who gave him to understand that the intelligence from England was generally sent to cardinal Pole. That pre∣late's pen being still recognized in some of the keenest satires, Henry conceived such an implacable resentment against him as he had never harboured against any other person; and wreaked his revenge on the cardinal's family. Pope Paul III. now published the bull against Henry, which he had hitherto sus∣pended; he endeavoured to instigate all christian princes against him, and even offered the kingdom of England to James king of Scotland.</P>

About the same time, he ordered the clergy to read the Lord's prayer, the confession of Faith, and the ten Commandments, in English. They were directed to recommend good works, and teach the peo∣ple, that relics, rosaries, and such trompery, were unnecessary to salvation. All the images to which devotees made offerings, were pulled down, all the tapers were taken away, except those that burned before the representation of Christ; and he suppressed all the invocations of Ora pro nobis, added to the prayers addressed to saints.</P>

<P>Although this ordinance was a mortal blow to the old religion, the king was now so absolute, that no person would venture to express the least disapprobation. Gardiner bishop of Winchester, had by this time returned from France: he detested the reformation in his heart, was suspected of having reconciled himself privately to the pope; and of carrying on a correspondence with the emperor. Nevertheless, he dissembled in such a manner, that the king<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who despised his intellects, had no doubt of his fidelity; and even be∣stowed upon him some degree of his confidence, on account of his complai∣sance and submission. As he seemed to enter into all the king's measures with the utmost zeal of obedience, Henry willingly listened to him in his suggestions against the Sacramentarians, or those who denied the real presence in the Eu∣charist, especially as this was a doctrine to which the king himself was firmly attached. Gardiner imagined, that the zeal of those who favoured the refor∣mation, when persecuted, would irritate the temper of the king, who was impa∣tient of contradiction; and that he would crush them during the prevalence of his indignation. The bishop carried his point so far as to raise a persecution against the Sacramentarians, one of whom called John Nicholson, alias Lambert, suffered death as an heretic. He had been minister of the English company at
<PB N="631" REF="6430"/>
Antwerp, from which office he was dismissed on account of his belief. He afterwards kept a school at London; and hearing doctor Taylor preach upon the real presence in the Sacrament, presented him with his reasons for contra∣dicting that doctrine. The paper was carried to Cranme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who was then of Luther's opinion in that article, and endeavoured to convince Lambert of his error. But, this last appealed to the king, who undertook to consute him in Westminster-Hall, before the bishops, nobility, and judges of the realm. A <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dispute was accordingly maintained by Henry, seconded by all his prelates, who extolled his learning with the most extravagant encomiums. Lambert was brow-beaten, confounded, and convicted of heresy: but, he chose to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gn his life, rather than part with his opinion; and was burned at Smithfield, with horrid circumstances of barbarity. The adulation of the learned, inspired the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> king with such an opinion of his own ability, as proved equally fatal to both parties; for, he now resolved to punish rigorously all those who should pre∣sume to differ from him in point of opinion, without making any distinction between papist and reformer.

About this time they flattered themselves they had gained an accession of strength in the pro∣motion of Bonner to the see of Hereford, vacant by the death of Edward <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ox: but, they were grievously disappointed; for that prelate, notwithstanding the obligations he had been laid under by the chiefs of the reformation, became one of their most rancorous enemies. At the death of Stokesley, he was afterwards advanced to the see of London. Cromwell and Cranmer perceiving that their credit began to diminish, thought there was no method so likely to retrieve their influence at court, as that of persuading the king to marry another wife, upon whose protection they might depend. With this view they turned their eyes to Germany; and Cromwell undertook to negotiate a match between Henry, and Anne sister to the duke of Cleves and to the dutchess of Saxony. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert.</NOTE></P>

<P>Henry still esteemed Cranmer for his conscientious behaviour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tho' he opposed the statute of the six articles; and sent the duke of Norfolk to assure him of the continuation of his affection. He afterwards discoursed with him upon that law; and allowed him to explain the reasons that induced him to oppose it. He even ordered him to commit these reasons to writing, though such a step was rendered capital by the statute. Cranmer accordingly drew up a memorial on the subject, which being lost by accident, fell into the hands of a person who would have delivered it to the king<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had not he been prevented by Cromwell. Shaxton bishop of Salisbury, and Latimer of Worcester, who had likewise opposed the articles, were not so favourably dealt with. In order to appease the king's resentment which they had incurred, they thought proper to resign their bishoprics; but, they had no sooner made this sacrifice, than they were accused of harbouring sentiments contrary to the statute, and com∣mitted prisoners to the Tower of London. When the session of parliament broke up, the king appointed commissioners devoted to the catholic religion, and sent them through the kingdom, to discover all those who condemned the six articles, that they might be punished with all the rigour of the law. In London alone, above five hundred persons were imprisoned on this account, after having been inveigled into confession by the commissioners; but, the chancellor represented the pernicious consequences of such a persecution, in such pathetic terms to the king, that he pardoned all those who had been ap∣prehended; and put a stop for the present to all further enquiry. The king's will was now become the measure of the law, because both partie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cultivated his favour with the most abject complaisance. Bonner bishop of London, though in secret a zealous partisan of the papal power, managed his interest with such dexterity, that he obtained letters patent, adjudging to him the spiri∣tualities

<P>Henry foreseeing a rupture between the emperor and the pro∣testants of Germany, sent new ambassadors to the league of Smalcalde, to en∣courage them in their opposition to the house of Austria; and to promise he<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> would engage in their association. They perceived his drift was only to amuse them, and intimidate the emperor by means of a negotiation with his enemies; and they frankly gave him to understand, that they would unite with him on no other terms, than that of his embracing the confession of Augsburg. They said, they had heard with great mortification of his persecuting their brethren in his kingdom; and in particular, complained of the law of the six articles, the injustice of which Melanchthon explained to him in a submissive letter. Henry was shocked at the freedom of their expostulation; and Gardiner, by flattering his vanity, added fuel to his resentment. It was not in his power, however, to prevent an incident which in a great measure forwarded the refor∣mation. Though the king was in possession of the supremacy, he could not be satisfied until the people should be convinced of his right to that prehemi∣nence; and Cranmer knowing his anxiety on this subject, told him, that nothing would contribute to their undeception, more than a free use of the Scriptures, by which they would see that the pope's authority was not founded on the word of God. Henry no sooner signified his approbation of this proposal, than Gardiner employed all his art and rhetoric, to prevent such a fatal blow to the catholic religion. The two prelates disputed on the subject in presence of the king, who decided in favour of Cranmer, telling the other, he was but a novice, who ought not to enter the lists with such an experienced general. The truth<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</NOTE> is, he thought his own interest coincided with Cranmer's propositions. He granted letters patent to Cromwell as his vicegerent, importing, That his sub∣jects should have free and liberal use of the Bible translated into the English tongue; and that for five years there should be no impression of the Bible, or any part of it, but only by such as he should appoint. Towards the end of<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rnet.</NOTE> this year, the inhabitants of Ghent mutinied, and offered to acknowledge the French king as their sovereign, if he would protect them from the resent∣ment of the emperor. But Francis rejected their proposal, which he commu∣nicated to Charles, who had by this time amused him so effectually with the promise of restoring to him the dutchy of Milan, that he ventured to pass through his dominions on the faith of a simple safe-conduct, and even visited him at Paris, where he was received with the same honours which the French payed to their own sovereign.</P>

<P>At this very period, Anne of Cleves arrived in England, after the match between her and Henry had been concluded, under the direction of Cromwell.

Next day Cromwell asked him how he liked his new bed-fellow?<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Yet he lived decently with her for five months, during which his aversion seemed to increase; though she did not appear much afflicted at his disgust.

Those commissioners being approved by the parliament, re∣ceived orders to begin their inquiry without delay: and in the mean time, the king created Cromwell earl of Essex.

<P>Immediately after the prorogation of this parliament, the fall of Cromwell was decreed. He was hated and envied as an upstart by the nobility in general, and detested by all the Roman catholics, as the inveterate enemy of their religion. The king had expressed great dissatisfaction at his conduct in eff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct∣ing this disagreeable marriage; and the duke of Norfolk and Gardiner did not fail to inflame his discontent. They represented, that the kingdom was filled with malecontents on the score of religion; that they looked upon the vicege∣rent as author of all those measures which they disapproved; that Cromwell had deceived his majesty in the affair of his marriage; that he had raised an immense fortune by oppression; and that the king, by sacrificing him to the resentment of the public, would intirely conciliate the affections of his people. This last argument had great weight with Henry, who was really incensed in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert.</NOTE> his heart against Cromwell; and thought he had no further use for his service in treating with the league of Smalcalde, as he had by this time determined to make peace with the emperor, who he foresaw would break with Francis about the dutchy of Milan. On these considerations, he gave up Cromwell to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> revenge of his enemies. Upon the meeting of the parliament, the duke of Norfolk, at the council-table, arrested the earl of Essex, in the king's name, for high treason; and he was immediately sent prisoner to the Tower. His dis∣grace
<PB N="636" REF="6480"/>
was no sooner known, than all his friends forsook him, except Cranmer, who wrote such a letter to Henry in his behalf, as no other man in the kingdom would have presumed to indite; but it produced no effect in favour of the un∣fortunate Cromwell, who, without being heard in his own defence, was by a bill of attainder found guilty of divers heresies and treasons; and condemned to suffer the pains of death, as the king should think proper to direct.</P>

<P>The fall of Cromwell was immediately followed by the dissolu∣tion of the marriage between Henry and his new wife: a dissolution on which he had set his heart, not only on account of his aversion to Anne of Cleves, but also because he was by this time enamoured of Catherine Howard, daugh∣ter to lord Edmund, brother to the present duke of Norfolk. The whole house of lords, with a committee of the commons, waited upon the king with an address, de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing he would order trial to be made of the validity of his mar∣riage; and his majesty complying with their request, a commission was granted for trying it in convocation. They forthwith proceeded to the examination of witnesses, including the depositions of the king and members of the privy coun∣cil; a declaration under the hand of Cromwell, signed in the Tower; the evidence of the earl of Southampton; the lord Russel, at that time admiral; Sir Anthony Brown, Sir Anthony Denny, doctor Chambers and Butts, the queen's physici∣ans, and some ladies of the chamber. The substance of the whole amounted to these particulars: That there had been a precontract between the queen and the marquis of Lorraine: that it did not appear whether these spousals were made by the parties themselves, or in the words of the present tense: that the king having married her against his will, had not given a pure, inward, and complete consent: and, that he had never consummated the marriage. These frivolous objections were strongly insisted upon by the popish party, and Cran∣mer being influenced by the fear of his life, yielded his assent; so that the con∣vocation unanimously judged the marriage null; and on the ninth day of July sentence was given for its dissolution. On the tenth of July, this sentence was notified to both houses, by whom it was approved; then the king sent the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Southampton, and the bishop of Winchester, to intimate the transaction to Anne of Cleves, who expressed no sort of dissatisfaction at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

They told her the king would by letters patent declare her his adopted sister, give her precedency before all the ladies in England but his own wife and daughter; that an estate of three thousand pounds a-year would be allotted for her maintenance; and, that she might either live in England or return to her own country. She chose to live in England, and was prevailed upon to write a letter to her brother, approving what had been done.

<P>This important affair being terminated, the parliament, by a new act, mitigated the penalties in one of the six articles of the statute of blood, relating to ecclesiastics who should violate their vows of chastity. The commissioners appointed by the king to examine the doctrines of religion, hav∣ing drawn up a long report on that subject, a statute was enacted, implying, That their report should have the force of a law, as well as every thing that the king should ordain on the subject of religion. Thus, they vested in the king,
<PB N="637" REF="6490"/>
that infallibility of which they had deprived the pope. This complaisant par∣liament gave away the liberties of the nation in every respect: they first made the king absolute master of their lives and fortunes, and now they sub∣jected their consciences to his will and pleasure; but this last act they clogged with a contradiction, in these words, Provided nothing should be done contrary to the laws of the realm. They passed another act, ordaining that a marriage, already consummated, should not be dissolved on account of a precontract, or any other hindrances than those of the divine law. This statute, which so palpably contradicted the king's own conduct in the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his wives, was intended as a previous step towards the legitimation of the princess Eli∣zabeth, and his marriage with Catherine Howard. The convocation of the clergy in the province of Canterbury granted one fifth of their revenues, payable in five years to the king, as a mark of their gratitude for the pains he had taken to deliver the English church from papal tyranny. Notwithstanding this ample gratification, the king demanded a subsidy from parliament; and though the members had been so long accustomed to behave towards him with the most servile complaisance, they could not help expressing their sur∣prize at this demand, considering the tranquillity of the times, and the great sums the king had derived from the dissolution of the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>steri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Warm de∣bates were maintained on this subject in the house of commons: but the par∣tisans of the court representing the great expence the king had incurred by putting the sea-coast in a posture of defence, the majority acquiesced in this reason, and voted a very considerable subsidy.</P>

<P>This condescending parliament was closed with an act of am∣nesty; from the benefit of which, however, the countess of Salisbury, and Cromwell, were excluded, as well as those who were convicted of having denied the king's supremacy, or of having violated any of the articles in the statute of blood. Cromwell's fortitude seemed to forsake him when he was arrested: being required to send to the king a full account of his transactions in the marriage, he concluded his letter in the most abject manner. He subscribed himself a most woeful prisoner, ready to take the death, when it should please God and his majesty; yet (he said) the frail flesh incited him continually to call to his grace for mercy, and grace for his offences. He dated the letter at the Tower, this Wednesday the last of June, with the heavy heart and tremb∣ling hand of your highness's most heavy and most miserable prisoner, and poor slave, Thomas Cromwell; and below the subscription he wrote <Q>“Most gra∣cious prince, I cry for mercy, mercy, mercy.”</Q> He afterwards wrote such a pathetic letter to the king, that Henry seemed affected with it, and caused it to be read thrice over in his hearing; but these impressions were effaced by the beauty of Catherine Howard, and the insinuations of the duke of Norfolk and the bishop of Winchester; so that a warrant was granted for his being be∣headed on Tower-hill. When he was brought to the scaffold, his regard for his son hindered him from expatiating upon his own innocence. He thanked God for bringing him to that death for his transgressions; he acknowledged his offences against God and his prince, who had raised him from a low de∣gree; confessed he had been seduced, but that now he died in the catholic faith. Then he desired the bye-standers to pray for the king, the prince, and for himself; and, having spent a little time at his own private devotion, sub∣mitted
<PB N="638" REF="6500"/>
his neck to the executioner, who mangled him in a shocking manner. This great minister was the son of a blacksmith; and, though he had not the benefit of a liberal education, he raised himself by his natural sagacity and dex∣terity in business to the highest offices of the state. He bore his prosperity with great moderation; was particularly grateful to those who had assisted him in his necessities; and such was his integrity, that his enemies could not fix any<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

The king is said to have lamented his death; and the fall of the new queen, who did not long survive Cromwell, together with the miseries that fell upon the duke of Norfolk and his family in the sequel, were considered as the judgments of heaven upon them for their croel persecution of this minister.

In a few days after Cromwell's death, a number of people were executed together for very different crimes: some for having denied the king's supremacy, and others for having main∣tained the Lutheran doctrines. These last were three priests of the name of Barnes, Gerard, and Jerome; they had been condemned by act of parliament, for spreading heresy and falsifying the Holy Scripture; and they suffered at the stake with great constancy, praying for their persecutors.</P>

<P>On the eighth day of August the king declared his marriage with Catherine Howard, whom he had some time ago privately espoused; and as this lady was wholly devoted to her uncle the duke of Norfolk, and Gar∣diner bishop of Winchester; the partisans of the pope began to flatter them∣selves with the prospect of a change in matters of religion. They marked out Cranmer as a sacrifice. Already they began to revile him openly; and a member of parliament publicly declared in the house, that he was chief and protector of the innovators. The commissioners appointed to draw up an exposition of the christian doctrine having finished their work, it was published by the king's order; and then the world perceived, that, instead of advancing, it checked the progress of the reformation. Other commissioners, employed to reform the missals, made hardly any other alteration than that of rasing out the pope's name, when it occurred; and every thing seemed to prognosticate the fall of Cranmer, though his enemies proceeded very gradually in the work of his de∣struction, well knowing that he was personally beloved by his sovereign.</P>

<P>During these transactions in England, the good understanding, so lately established between the emperor and Francis, suffered a sudden inter∣ruption. While Charles tarried at Paris, he positively promised to bestow the dutchy of Milan on the duke of Orleans; but postponed the cession until he should arrive in the Low Countries, that he might not seem to have acted on compulsion, in which case the cession would be deemed void: after his departure from France, however, he still found new pretences for delaying the execution of his promise; and in the mean time subdued and chastised the inhabitants of Ghent, who had revolted. Francis, finding that he had no in∣tention to part with the Milanese, was so incensed at his disappointment that he disgraced his chancellor Poyet, and the constable Montmorency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bell<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</NOTE> who had advised him to trust to the word of the emperor. In the course of this year, a rupture had well nigh happened between the French and English, on account of a bridge that Francis ordered to be built upon a river, which divided his dominions from the English territory in Picardy. The garrison of Calais

<P>A new flame was now on the point of breaking out in Europe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Charles endeavoured to intimidate the Porte from a commission of hostilities, by affecting an intimate union with the kings of France and England: he promised to erect the Low Countries into a kingdom, and be∣stow it upon the duke of Orleans. Francis, who perceived his drift, and knew his insincerity, appointed ambassadors for the courts of Constantinople and Venice, in order to disabuse those powers; but as they sailed down the Po in a boat, they were assassinated by the direction of the marquis of Guast, governor of Milan. The French king complained loudly of this outrage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> for which however he received no satisfaction from the emperor; and this was a fresh source of animosity. Charles, at this time, had convoked a diet at Ra∣tisbon; and, as this was no season for disturbing the protestants, he granted them another respite called The Interim, that they might the more chearfully furnish him with succours against the infidels. The king of the Romans had already invested Buda, which he hoped to reduce before the Turks should come to its assistance: but, the garrison making a gallant defence, the Ottoman army came to their relief, and obtained a signal victory over the Germans. Never∣theless, the emperor, instead of marching into Hungary, great part of which was now in the hands of Solyman, repaired to Italy, and embarked at Porto Venere with an army of five and twenty thousand men, destined to act against Barbarossa, who had seized the sovereignty of Algiers. He landed in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.</NOTE> neighbourhood of that city, on the twenty-second day of October; but before he could undertake any thing of consequence, a violent tempest destroyed the best part of his fleet, and he was obliged to reimbark in the beginning of November.</P>

<P>Mean while, Henry king of England, understanding that his nephew James, the Scottish monarch, was entirely directed by the council of some churchmen devoted to the see of Rome, began to be afraid, that he might be brought over to the interests of the emperor, and at his instigation disturb the English dominions. He earnestly desired to persuade James to follow his example in renouncing the papal authority, and was vain enough to believe his own eloquence was sufficient for this purpose. He therefore sent ambassadors to demand an interview at York, and James agreed to the pro∣posals<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but the Scottish clergy, fearing the consequences of this interview, found means to dissuade their sovereign from going to York; and, after Henry had waited for him some days in that city, he received letters of excuse, at which he was exceedingly incensed. The chagrin he felt at this disappointment was a meer trifle in comparison of what now awaited him on his return to
<PB N="640" REF="6520"/>
London. He had, upon all occasions, expressed the most perfect satisfaction in his present marriage. He was so captivated with the queen's accomplishments, that when he received the sacrament on All Saint's day, he thanked God for his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed his confessor to join with him in the same thank<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>giving. This joy however was of very short duration: while he was at York, a man of the name of Lassels had waited upon Cranmer at London; and, from the information of his sister, who had been servant to the dutchess dowager of Norfolk, g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e him a very surprising account of the queen's incontinence. He said she had led a very lewd life before her marriage, carried on a scanda∣lous correspondence with two men called Deirham and Mannock; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he continued to indulge herself in the same criminal pleasure since she was rai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to her present greatness. Cranmer was equally surprised and embarrassed at this intelligence, which he communicated to the chancellor and some other members of the privy council, who advised him to make the king acquainted with the whole affair, at his return to London. The archbishop knew what a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>que he ran, by intermeddling in such a delicate subject with a prince of Henry's disposition: but he likewise knew the danger of suppressing such in∣formation. He therefore resolved to commit what he had heard to writing, in the form of a memorial, which he delivered into the king's own hand, de∣siring his majesty to read it in private. Henry believed at first it was a piece of calumny, and determined to punish the authors with the utmost severity. With this view he ordered the keeper of the privy seal to examine Lassels, who repeated the same story, and even produced his sister, by whom it was con∣firmed. Then Deirham and Mannock being arrested, confessed that they had carnally known the queen; that one of her principal confidents in those stolen debauches was the lady Rochford, who had accused her husband of incest with Anne Boleyn; that this lady had introduced into the queen's bed-chamber one Culpeper, who had stayed with her from eleven at night till four o'clock in the morning. As the queen had taken Deirham into her service, it was presumed the intended to continue in the same course of life. When she was first ques∣tioned about these particulars, she denied the charge; but afterwards, under∣standing that Deirham and Mannock had discovered what they knew, she con∣fessed that before her marriage she had admitted several men to her bed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Herbert.

<P>While the king of France attacked the emperor in five places at once, without any great success, Henry resolved to take vengeance on the king of Scotland for the affront he had sustained at his hands in the affair of the interview; to compel the Scottish nation to relinquish their connexions with the enemies of England; and to oblige James to renounce the papal au∣thority. As a pretext was wanting for his committing hostilities, he pretended that the truce had been violated; that certain English rebels had been enter∣tained in Scotland; and he published a manifesto, in which he claimed that right of superiority over the kingdom of Scotland which we have enlarged upon in the reign of the first Edward. James, being apprized of his uncle's intention, began to put himself in a posture of defence, and sent two ambas∣sadors to London with proposals of accommodation. These were detained at the English court, under various pretences, until Henry was ready to take the field, and even then they were obliged to attend the army which was sent into
<PB N="642" REF="6540"/>
their country under the command of the duke of Norfolk. Two other Scottish ambassadors, meeting that nobleman on his march, were detained as prisoners until he arrived at Berwick.

James, in the mean time, assembled an army of fifteen thousand men, with a train of artillery, appointed the lord Maxwell general, and resolved to invade England on the western side by Sol∣way fri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.

When the tidings of Mary's birth, and her father's death arrived at the same time, Henry, thought this was a favoura∣ble conjuncture for effecting an union of the two kingdoms, by a match between Edward prince of Wales, and the young queen of Scotland. He ordered his emissaries to sound the dispositions of the prisoners on this subject; and finding them well inclined to support such a proposal, he set them at liberty, on con∣dition, that they should return to London, in case the project should not succeed.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ch. 1543.</NOTE> Scotland was left in great confusion by the untimely death of its mo∣narch. The next heir to the crown after young Mary, was James Hamilton earl of Arran, a man of a moderate genius, and quiet disposition. He favoured the reformation, but was altogether unfit for the management of public affairs. On account of his bias towards the new religion, he was hated by the clergy, and the queen dowager, who was sister to the duke of Guise, and blindly devoted to the papal authority. Her bigotry and superstition were encouraged by Da∣vid Beaton archbishop of St. Andrew's, a priest of a violent temper, who had persecuted the reformers with the utmost rancour; and obtained a cardinal's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, as a recompence for his zealous attachment to the see of Rome. This pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate,

seeing all the nobility of the kingdom at variance among themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣solved to make his advantage of this civil confusion; and produced a forged will of the late king, by which he himself was appointed regent or viceroy dur∣ing the minority of Mary. He was supported in his pretensions to thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> officeby all the credit and influence of the queen dowager. On the other hand, the friends of the reformation incited the earl of Arran to claim the regency, by virtue of his proximity of blood; and thus animated, he determined to demand it at the meeting of the next parliament, after he should have detected the Forgery of the will produced by Beaton. His party gained a considerable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccession by the arrival of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chibald Douglas earl of Angus, and his brother William, who now returned from England, after an exile of fifteen years. When the parliament assembled, the will was examined, the fraud discovered, and the earl of Arran appointed regent of the kingdom. Henry sent Sir Ralph Sadler as his ambas∣sador to this assembly, to propose the match between prince Edward and their young queen. Notwithstanding the cardinal's opposition, the proposal was embraced; the parliament appointed the two Douglases, and some other person<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as ambassadors, to negotiate the treaty, which was concluded at London on the first day of July, importing, That the young queen should be educated in Scot∣land until she should have attained the tenth year of her age: and, that the Scottish parliament should send three hostages of distinction to reside in Eng∣land, until the marriage should be accomplished. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>These measures, however, were defeated by the intrigues of Beaton, who, by means of a large contribution from the clergy, bribed and caballed with such success, that the people in general exclaimed against the treaty with Eng∣land, as an union that would end in their own slavery. The English ambas∣sador was insulted by the populace; the regent had no longer power to protect him, much less to send the hostages stipulated in the treaty. Then he summoned the prisoners to return to England, according to their engagement; but, none of them would trust themselves in the power of Henry, except Gilbert Ken∣nedy earl of Cassils, who prized his honour above his liberty, and returned to London, where Henry compared him to Attilius Regulus, and was so pleased with his punctilious behaviour, that he dismissed him without ransom, after having bestowed upon him extraordinary marks of favour and esteem; at the same time, he resolved to declare war against Scotland. Mean while, the queen and the cardinal, in order to strengthen their party against the interest of the Hamiltons, iuvited Matthew Stuart earl of Lennox to return from France, where he had resided for some time, promising that he should marry the queen dowager; and, in case of the infant Mary's death, succeed to the crown in preference to Arran, whose father's marriage was liable to some objections. Allured by this bait, the earl of Lennox returned to Scotland, and levied a body of men, in order to rescue the young queen from the hands of the regent, who proposed an accommodation, which was accordingly effected. The earl of Arran tired of opposing the queen dowager and cardinal, resolved <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unite himself with them fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the future; but, before they would receive him into their confidence, he was obliged to abjure the doctrines of the reformation, which he had hitherto professed. When they gained this important point, they had no further oc∣casion for Lennox, whom the queen dowager amused with hopes of the mar∣riage, while she, by letters, intreated the king of France to recal him to that
<PB N="644" REF="6560"/>
kingdom, as a person whose presence obstructed the French interest in Scotland. Before these letters arrived in France, however, the French king had remitted a considerable sum to Lennox, in order to be distributed among his friends in Scotland; for this was the method by which he and Henry supported factions in that country. Lennox, perceiving that the queen had no intention to fulfil her promise, divided part of the money among his own friends; and the car∣dinal, who expected to have received the largest portion, was so exasperated at his disappointment, that he instigated the regent to raise a body of forces, and surprise Glasgow, to which Lennox had retired with his acquisition. This nobleman suspecting their drift, levied ten thousand men for his own defence, and fortified Glasgow and Dunbarton, while the regent proceeded very slowly in his endeadvours to assemble an army. At length a peace was concluded between the two parties, and the chiefs were externally reconciled at Edinburgh, from whence they repaired together to Stirling; but Lennox receiving intimation of a conspiracy against him, quitted the court abruptly, and retired to his fortress of Dunbarton, where he first learned the ill offices the queen dowager had done him with the king of France.</P>

<P>In the month of July, Henry once more changed his condition, by marrying a sixth wife, in the person of Catherine Parr, the late lord Latimer's widow, a woman of discretion, already passed the meridian of life, who ma∣naged his temper with prudence and success. She favoured the reformation in her heart: but, she knew how dangerous it was to contradict the king in reli∣gious matters; and therefore she would not venture to interpose in behalf of three protestants that were burned at Windsor, immediately after her marriage, at the sollicitation of Gardiner bishop of Winchester. That prelate, and the other enemies of the reformation, not contented with the destruction of those, and other such innocent enthusiasts, eagerly aspired at the ruin of Cranmer, whom they considered as the head and protector of all those innovators in reli∣gion; and on the supposition, that the king would bear no contradicton in ar∣ticles of faith, they ventured to insinuate to his majesty, that heresy would never be weeded out of the land, while its protector was suffered to flourish. Henry, at first, made no answer to these insinuations, because he guessed their aim, and supposed his silence would discourage them from renewing their attempts; but Gardiner, and the duke of Norfolk, with other partisans of popery, repeated the same strain so often, that his curiosity was interested. He seemed to listen with pleasure to their remonstrances, and even received some articles of accusation against Cranmer, subscribed with the names of his accusers; for, the duke and the bishop being unwilling to appear as parties in the affair, had prevailed upon the canons of Canterbury, and some justices of the peace in Kent, to prefer those articles against the archbishop. Henry thus informed, took an opportu∣nity, while he diverted himself on the river Thames, to stop at Lambeth, where Cranmer resided, and that prelate coming down to receive his majesty, was or∣dered to come into the barge, where the king conversed with him in private. He expressed his uneasiness at the growth of heresy, which he said he was re∣solved to extirpate, by punishing its fautors and protectors with the utmost ri∣gour of the law. Cranmer applauded his resolution; but intreated him, in the name of God, to examine well what was branded with the name of heresy, lest, in punishing supposed heretics, he should wreak his vengeance on the faithful servants of the Almighty: then the king told him, that he was supposed to be the chief protector of the heretics, and put into his hand the articles of accu∣sation; which the archbishop having perused with great composure, he fell upon his knees, and desired he might be brought to trial. He frankly owned, that with respect to the law of the six articles, which he had so strenuously opposed, his sentiments still remained unaltered, though he had never spoke, nor acted against it in any shape, since it acquired the force of a law.

the king asked if he was really married, he answered in the affirmative; but declared, that as soon as the law of the six articles had passed through both houses, he sent his wife to Germany. Henry was so struck with the candour and integrity of this truly primitive bishop, that he assured him of his protection, made him acquainted with the scheme that was formed for his destruction<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disclosed to him the names of his accusers; and commanded him to prosecute them for defamation. Cranmer begged to be excused; but the king insisted upon his proceeding, and desired him to nominate the judges. The archbi∣shop, however, proceeded so coldly in this prosecution, that Henry seeing it was against his inclination, allowed him to drop it, though he could not help admiring his generosity. Such was the simplicity of Cranmer's heart, that he could not distinguish his own enemies; and such his benevolence, that he could not with-hold his assistance from those whom he knew to be his enemies. One day, he went to court to sollicit in favour of a person who had craved his in∣terest. Henry asked him, if he thought that person was his friend, and he re∣plying in the affirmative, <Q>“No (said the king) he is your inveterate foe, and I order you to call him knave when next you see him.”</Q> Cranmer begged<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> he might be excused from using such expressions as did not become the mouth of a bishop. Henry said he would be obeyed; but, Cranmer sound means to avoid the meeting; and the king continued to admire and love him for his christian meekness and integrity. On the twenty-third day of Decem∣ber, lord Parr, the queen's brother, was created earl of Essex; and her uncle was honoured with the title of baron Parr, and the office of queen's cham∣ber<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain. The war still continued between the emperor and the king of France. In the beginning of the campaign Francis obtained some advantages in Flan∣ders, which he lost again when Charles arrived in the Low Countries with an army of Spaniards. Barbarossa the Turkish admiral having joined the count d'Enghien at Marseilles with one hundred and ten gallies, the united fleets steered towards Nice, which they attacked, and reduced the town; but, the castle was defended so vigorously, that they were obliged to abandon the en∣terprize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> and Barbarossa returned in the spring to Turkey.</P>

<P>All the assistance Charles received from the king of England dur∣ing this campaign, was a body of six thousand troops sent over under Sir John Wallop, who joined the emperor's army in the Low Countries; but the two allies formed the project of entering France by Picardy and Champagne in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1554.</NOTE> ensuing summer. Mean while, that nothing might interrupt the good under∣standing re-established between them, Henry resolved to keep his word with regard to the princess Mary; and the parliament being assembled in January, passed an act, regulating the different degrees of those who, after the king's death, might pretend to the succession. Prince Edward and his posterity held the first rank in this act of settlement: the next place was occupied by the male issue which the king might have either by the reigning queen, or any future lawful wife: the third rank was allotted to the princess Mary and her issue: and the fourth to Elizabeth and her children: but, to convince these princesses, that they owed this distinction intirely to their father's favour, this act subjected them to any conditions he should please to impose, which, should they reject, they were deprived of all right of succession: besides, in case of their disobeying their father, or dying without issue, the king was impowered
<PB N="647" REF="6590"/>
to regulate the order of succession according to his own pleasure, either by will or letters patent. By a clause of this statute, all the subjects were obliged to take a new oath, renouncing the authority of the bishop of Rome, on pain of incurring heavy penalties, which were likewise decreed against those who should violate any articles contained in this act of parliament. In this session, the title of King of England, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and Supreme head of the Anglicane and Irish churches, was inseparably annexed to the crown of England. Another act deprived the ecclesiastical courts of the power to oppress the subjects on pretence of heresy, by decreeing, That no person could be judged on the statute of the six articles, before the accusation should be approved by a jury of twelve men, sworn before the king's commis∣sioners, to be appointed for that purpose. Then the parliament passed a strange<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert</NOTE> bill, by which the king was released from all the debts he owed to indivi∣duals; and lastly, they granted him a power to appoint commissioners for examining and altering the ecclesiastical constitutions. About this period, the lord Audley dying, was succeeded in the office of chancellor by Thomas Wriothesley, a great stickler for the old religion.</P>

<P>The king of France understanding, that the emperor and king of England intended to attack him in the center of his dominions with an army of one hundred thousand men, recalled twelve thousand men from Italy, where they had served under the young count D'Enghien, who had obtained a signal victory over the marquis de Guast at Cerisoles, and would in all proba∣bility have subdued the Milaneze, had not he been thus disabled from pursuing his good fortune. Henry, mean while, continued to make preparations for this mighty invasion; and resolved to render them subservient to two purposes. His design was to humble Scotland before he should embark for the continent. He had no intention to make conquests, but only to compel the Scots, by the terror of his arms, to consent to the marriage which he had already proposed. That people was in no condition to maintain a war; but cardinal Beaton, who now governed them under the name of the regent, was a prelate of such vio∣lence and obstinacy, that he chose rather to expose his country to destruction, than consent to a match that would ruin his own fortune. Henry therefore re∣solved to send into Scotland part of the forces itended for France; and the care of the expedition was intrusted to the earl of Hartford, and John Dudley <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aron of Lisle, the admiral of England. The army embarked at Newcastle, and landing at Leith, marched directly to Edinburgh, which they pillaged and burned, without meeting the least opposition. They did not attack the castle, but returning to Leith, reduced that town to ashes; and reimbarking, re∣turned to Berwick. Henry had occasion for his troops in the execution of his great project against France; and he thought he had done enough to intimidate the Scots into his measures. But, on this occasion he deviated from the dictates of sound policy. Instead of intimidating the Scots into compliance, he rendered himself odious to the whole nation by this cruel descent. He ought either to have conquered the whole kingdom, while it was in his power, or to have conci∣liated the affection of the natives by the lenity and generosity of his conduct, while they were at his mercy. He might have made his own terms when his troops were in possession of Edinburgh, before he had driven the Scots to de∣spair, by reducing their capital to ashes.</P>

<P>Mean while, the earl of Lennox finding himself abandoned by the French king, whom the queen dowager and her relations of the house of Guise had prepossessed against him, began to sound the disposition of Henry to∣wards himself and his intimate friend the earl of Glencairn. The king of England lending a willing ear to his proposals, Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncairn, and the bishop of Caithness, bro∣ther to Lennox, with two other persons, repaired to Carlisle, where they treated with Henry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s commissioners; and engaged in the following conventions: That they would cause the true word of God to be preached in their territories: That, to the best of their power they would hinder their young queen from being removed out of Scotland, unless she could be put into the hands of the king of England: That they would employ all their interest in obtaining for Henry the administration and protectorship of Scotland: and, That the bishop of Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thness, and Hugh Cunningham, should remain as hostages in England. Henry promised on his part, that his army should not spo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their lands: That the regency of the kingdom should be bestowed upon Lennox, on con∣dition, that he should do nothing without Henry's advice: That this noble∣man should receive out of the crown-revenues a reasonable proportion for the maintenance of that dignity: That, in case of Mary's death, the king of Eng∣land should support his pretensions to the crown against those of the earl of Ar∣ran: That Glen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rn should have a pension of one thousand crowns: and, That Henry's niece the lady Margaret Douglas should be married to the earl of Lennox. This treaty being signed at Carlisle, the earl repaired to London, where he confirmed the agreement, and promised to deliver the castle of Dun∣barton, and the I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le of Bute, into the hands of the English; Henry engaging to furni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h him with five hundred men, and a pension for himself, and Striveling governor of Dunbarton castle. These conventions being ratified, Lennox failed thither with six hundred English soldiers in thirteen vessels, but Strive∣ling preferring his duty to his friendship for the earl, refused to admit them into the fortress. Thus disappointed, they ravaged the isles of Arran and Bute, plundered K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntyre and some other villages; and sailed back to Bristol, while Henry was abroad on his expedition. While Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nox was employed in this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>less attempt, a body of English made themselves masters of Jedburgh, Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o, and Coldingham, which last place they garrisoned before they retired to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own country. The cardinal and regent raised about eight thousand men to retake this town; but, the former hearing, that a detachment was on its march from Berwick to the relief of the place, was seized with such conster∣nation, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etook himself immediately to flight; the greatest part of the army instantly disbanded, and the art<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llery would have been abandoned to the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t comer, had not the earl of Angus carried it off by means of his own vas∣sals.

<P>By this time, the emperor having g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anted a toleration to the protestants, who purchased this indulgence with a good subsidy, he settled a new regulation touching the ensuing campaign, with his ally the king of Eng∣land; and these two powers agreed to bring above an hundred thousand men into the field, so as to join in the neighbourhood of Paris. Charles reduced
<PB N="649" REF="6610"/>
Luxemburg, fell into the Barrois, where he took Commercy and Ligny; then he entered Champagne, and invested St. Didier about the beginning of July. Henry understanding, that the Imperial army was in motion, ap∣pointed his queen regent of the realm in his absence, with a proper council, embarked his forces, amounting to thirty thousand; which landing at Calais about Midsummer, the duke of Norfolk with a detachment joined the count de Bures, who commanded about twelve thousand Imperialists; and these to∣gether undertook the siege of Montreuil. If Charles and Henry had not amused themselves in besieging towns, but marched directly to Paris, accord∣ing to the plan of operations, Francis would have been reduced to extremity; for, his whole army did not exceed forty thousand men. Henry arriving at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Du Bellay.</NOTE> Calais, and understanding that the emperor was employed in the siege of St. Didier, instead of advancing towards the heart of France, sat down before Boulogne, which surrendered on the twenty-sixth day of July. From that period the two allies began to distrust one another. They were both guilty of having infringed the treaty. The emperor, by indirect methods, proposed terms of peace to Francis, and Henry openly granted safe-conduct to the French ambas∣sado<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, who came to treat with him on the same subject. Mean while, Charles having at last made himself master of St. Didier, summoned Henry to march towards Paris, according to their convention; and the king of England excused himself until he should have reduced Boulogne. The emperor had already ad∣vanced as far as Chateau-Thierry, and filled all Paris with consternation; but, concluding, from Henry's answer, that the projected operations of the cam∣paign would not be put in execution, he renewed his secret negotiation with Francis, which had been suspended; and concluded a separate peace, which was signed at Crepy on the nineteenth day of September, without Henry's be∣ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

<P>Having thus delivered himself from the burthen of the war, he recalled his troops under the command of count de Bure; so that Henry was obliged to abandon the siege of Montre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il, and retire to Calais with all expedi∣tion, as the army was greatly diminished by sickness, and a draught made for the garrison of Boulogne; and the dauphin advanced against him at the head of a numerous army. That prince, who did not reach the Boullonois till after the retreat of the English, attempted to surprise the city by the breaches which were not yet repaired, and his troops had actually penetrated into the lower town; but, those in the upper part making a vigorous sally, obliged them to retire in disorder. A conference was afterwards opened at Calais by the commissioners of both nations, to treat of a pacification; but, the French in∣sisting upon Henry's abandoning Boulogne as a preliminary article, the nego∣tiation produced no effect. The king, at his return to England, ordered forti∣fications to be raised at Gravesend and Tilbury, for the defence of the river Thames, and took all the necessary precautions to repel an invasion, which he imagined Francis would attempt in his turn. The earl of Lennox, the lord Dacres, and Sir Thomas Wharton were sent with a body of forces into Scot∣land, where they took Dumfries, and plundered the country, from whence they carried off a very considerable booty. The success of this incursion encou∣raged Sir Ralph Evers, now created a baron, and Sir Bryan Layton, to make an∣other inroad in the winter, when they laid waste all Teviotdale, with the spoils

of which they returned in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iumph. In order to animate their endeavours in t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e prosecution of this war, they were indulged with a grant of all the lands they should conquer; and thus encouraged, they renewed their incursions in<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e spring.

<P>In the beginning of the year the marechal de Biez encamped with fourteen thousand men in the neighbourhood of Boulogne, in order to build a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort that should command the harbour; but, the earl o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hertford, who com∣manded in the town, making a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally with part of the garrison, compelled him to retire with precipitation, leaving behind some artillery, and great part of his baggage. Francis now determined to make one great effort against England. He equipped a vast fleet, and raised a very numerous army, designing to attack Bou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogne both by sea and land. He sent a reinforcement to the marechal de Biez, with order to build that fort which he had been obliged to leave undone. Mean while, he himself repairing to Havre de Grace, which was the rendez∣vous of his shipping, commanded his admiral Annebaut to set sail for the coast of England. The French <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eet arrived on the eightee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th day of July at Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>head, in sight of Portsmouth, where they were encountered by the English navy, which being greatly inferior to them in number, after a slight skirmish retired into the harbour. Then the French made a descent upon the Isle of Wight, where they burned a few farms and villages; and afterwards they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed on the coa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of Suffex, in hope that Henry, who had come to Ports∣mouth, would order his fleet to quit the harbour, and sail to the assistance of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e country. But, An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebaut being disappointed in his expectation, and find∣ing that excellent precautions had been taken for the security of the coast, he watered on the Isle of Wight, and retired towards Boulogne, where he set on shore four thousand soldiers, with all the pioneers which had been embarked for the exped<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion. Then he set sail again for the English coast; and Henry's fleet being by this time augmented, put to sea to give them battle: they met in a little time, and engaged each <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther with equal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury; but, night parting them, after they had fought two hours, the French retired to Havre de Grace, and the Englis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> admiral steering towards Normandy, ravaged the coasts of that province.</P>

<P>The principal aim of Francis was the reduction of Boulogne: he had hired ten thousand Land<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quenets for that service, and bestowed the command of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s whole army upon marechal de Biez, who encamped in the neighbourhood o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad undertaken to build at Portet. This work, how∣ever, advanced very slo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, through the ignorance of the marechal and his en∣gineer; at length being alarmed with a report that Henry had likewise engaged a strong body o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Landsquenets in his service, and intended to send over an army for the relief of Boulogne, he left the fort unfinished, and took post on the mountain of St. Lambert, that he might prevent the enemy from throwing succours into the town. No enemy appeared; for although Henry had ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed ten thousand Landsquenets, they came no farther than Liege,

While the French army lay encamped at St. Lambert, the duke of Orleans died at Chateau-Montier, to the unspeakable regret of his father Francis, whose peace with the emperor, in a great measure, depended upon the life of that young prince. Skirmishes were daily fought between parties of the English garrison of Boulogne and the French army, in one of which the duke d'Aumale, afterwards duke of Guise, received a surprising wound from a lance, which, penetrating at the corner of his eye, advanced half a foot within his skull, and, the lance breaking, the head of it remained in that po∣sition. It was withdrawn with great difficulty, and the wound cured by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Du Bellay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> admirable skill of Ambrose Pare, surgeon to the king of France; but a dread∣ful scar was left on the face of the duke, who thence acquired the epithet of Balafré, or Slashed Face.</P>

<P>The season being now pretty far advanced, the marechal de Biez was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai. Ld.

Such were the transactions of a campaign, which Francis began with an army of two h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndred thousand men, raised and maintained at a prodigious expence. The French king seeing all his measures had miscarried, that his kingdom was exhausted, and himself threatened with a new war by the emperor, as the conditions of the last treaty were dissolved by the death of the duke d'Orleans, began to be extremely desirous of reconciling himself with England: but, as he did not choose to be a suitor in his own name to Henry, he took such mea∣sures, that the princes of the league of Smalcalde offered themselves as me∣diators. This interposition appeared the more natural, as they were mena∣ced by the emperor, who had entered into a negotiation with the Turks, and could not be supposed to find a better expedient for their own safety than that of compromising the difference between Francis and Henry, and solliciting the protection of these two princes. They accordingly sent envoys into France and England, with proposals of mediation. These were well received at both courts: a congress was opened between Ardres and Guisnes; but, Francis de∣manding that Boulogne should be restored, and the Scots comprehended in the treaty, Henry refused to comply with these articles, and the negotiation proved ineffectual. The king of England, however, in hope of over-awing Francis into more condescension, sent the bishops of Winchester and West∣minster on an embassy to the emperor, as if he had been inclined to a recon∣ciliation with Charles. On the other hand Francis sent a body of five thousand men into Scotland, under the command of the count de Montgommeri, that a powerful division might be made upon the English frontiers. The Scottish army thus reinforced, amounting to fifteen thousand men, advanced towards the Tweed; and, small parties passing the river, made short incursions into the territories of England; but the French general could not persuade his allies to venture themselves wholly in the enemy's country. On the contrary, hearing the earl of Hertford was on his march to give them battle, they retired with great diligence, and in a few days dispersed. The protestants of Germany be∣gan

The war was carried on even in the winter season: the earl of Surry, son to the duke of Norfolk, who com∣manded at Boulogne, being informed of a convoy which the French conducted to the fort of Outreau, attacked it with part of his garrison, but was defeated and obliged to retreat in great confusion; and Henry was so mortified at this check that he recalled the earl, and sent the lord Grey to command in his room.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 1546.</NOTE> At the same time, the king, hearing the French designed to cut off the com∣munication between Boulogne and Calais, ordered the earl of Hertford, with ten thousand men, to go and take post at Amblevi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, where he built two forts to secure the communication. Notwithstanding these hostilities both kings passionately desired an accommodation: Francis perceived that the reduction of Boulogne was a much more difficult task than he had imagined; and he saw himself upon the e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of a war with the emperor, in which case he should want the assistance of such an ally as the king of England. Henry, on the other hand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was become so corpulent that he could not ascend the steps of the stair that led up to his chamber, without the utmost difficulty. This unwieldiness rendered him indolent and unfit for managing the administration; and grew upon him so fast that he believed it would soon put a period to his life: so that he was unwilling to leave an expensive war upon the hands of his infant suc∣cessor. Besides, he dreaded the power and ambition of the emperor, and de∣signs of the pope, against which he wished to raise a bulwark, by making an alliance with the king of France and the protestants of Germany. Both parties being thus favourably disposed, the plenipotentiaries of France and England opened a congress at Campes between Guisnes and Ardres. In the beginning of June, they concluded a treaty, importing, That Francis should pay to Henry at a certain day two millions of golden crowns, in lieu of the arrears of his pen∣sion, and the money expended in the siege of Boulog<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, which town Henry should keep in his own hands, until he should rece<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve payment of all that was due to him from the king of France; but, those debts being discharged, Bou∣logne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> with its territory, should be restored to its former owner.

<P>The war had proved so expensive, that, notwithstanding this accession to the subsidies granted in parliament and convocation, and the spoils of chapels, colleges, and hospitals, he was obliged to impose a new tax upon his subjects<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under the title of Benevolence. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge, alarmed at the act by which the colleges were granted to his majesty, presented petitions, imploring his favour and protection; and, after a long deliberation, he confirmed their charters and foundations, to which he added<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Trinity<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>college at his own expence. Before the conclusion of the peace the protestants of Germany sent prince Philip, brother of the elector palatine, to demand suc∣cours from Henry; and, in particular, to sollicit a supply of one hundred thousand crowns for the defence of the league: but, instead of money, he sent them seven propositions, containing the terms upon which he was willing to engage in a defensive league with the protestants. In the mean time the em∣peror and pope formed an alliance for their destruction: his holiness supplied him with money and a strong body of troops, under the command of Octavian Farnese. The protestants armed in their own defence, under the elector of Saxony and the landgrave of Hesse; but neither side cared to hazard an en∣gagement. At length, the king of the Romans, falling into the territories of the elector of Saxony, that prince was obliged to go to the relief of his own subjects; and, the landgrave being weakened by his departure, retired into his own dominions: so that the emperor being left master of the field, reduced Frankfort, Ulm, and several other towns of the League, where he found money for the maintenance of his army. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleidan.</NOTE></P>

<P>While the protestants in Germany took arms in defence of their doc∣trine, those who favoured the reformation in Scotland were persecuted by car∣dinal Beaton, under the regent's authority. Several persons were condemned to the flames for heresy, and among the rest, a minister of the name of Wishart, who had distinguished himself by his piety and learning, and was universally beloved for the integrity of his heart, and the innocence of his manners. He was burned at St. Andrew's, in sight of the barbarous primate, who had rejected the intercession of the regent and many other noblemen; and now feasted his eyes with the execution of this unfortunate man from a window of his own pa∣lace. Wishart suffered with admirable constancy; but the zealots of his per∣suasion, not contented with describing him as a primitive martyr, in point of courage and resignation, endeavoured to raise him to the dignity of a prophet, by alledging that he predicted the fate of his persecutor, who, in a few days after his death, was assassinated by Norman Lesley and his associates. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE></P>

<P>In England the reformation seemed neither to advance nor gain ground. The king dictated in all matters of faith, and neither party durst avow the least deviation from his opinions. For some time he had been in∣commoded by an ulcer in his leg; the pain of which, added to his corpulence and other infirmities, rendered him so peevish, and increased his natural iras∣cibility to such a degree, that scarce any person approached him without fear and trembling. In matters of religion he was ever impatient of contradiction; but, by this time his temper was so irritated, that those who presumed to differ from him in opinion could expect no mercy. Shaxton, who had resigned th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

bishopric of Salisbury, and still remained in prison for having refused to con∣form to the six articles, being now accused of denying the real presence in the sacrament, the king ordered that he should be prosecuted with the utmost rigou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of law; and he was condemned to the stake: but he saved his life by signing his recantation, and, in the sequel, became a cruel persecutor of the protestants. Anne Askew, a woman of good birth and uncommon talents, who was well known to many persons at court, being convicted of the same crime, chose ra∣ther to suffer death than purchase pardon at the expence of such abjuration. She was supposed to be favoured by some ladies of high rank, and even to have maintained some sort of religious correspondence with the queen; so that chan∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llor Wr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>othesley, hoping she might discover something that would furnish matter of impeachment against that princess, the earl of Hertford, or his coun∣tess, who favoured the reformation, caused this poor woman to be put to the rack; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s even said to have manually assisted in augmenting the torture, which, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh administered with unusual violence, she endured with the most amazing fortitude. Her bones were dislocated in such a manner, that they were obliged to carry her in a chair to the stake, where she suffered with four men, con∣demned on the same account; and the apostate Shaxton attended them to the place, where he preached a sermon, reproaching them in the harshest terms for their wilfulness and heresy.</P>

<P>The enemies of the reformation, perceiving the king was now more furiously than ever incensed against the Sacramentarians, made another effort to destroy Cranmer. They renewed their complaints against the arch∣bishop, as the protector of that pernicious sect; and told Henry, that were he once committed prisoner to the Tower, such proofs would appear against him, as would astonish his majesty. The king loved Cranmer with an affection which seemed to contradict every other part of his character; and he now re∣sented the presumption of those who attempted to ruin a man, in whose favour he had so often interposed. Nevertheless, he dissembled his sentiments, receiv∣ed the articles of his accusation, and permitted that he should next day be examined in council. In the night, however, he sent privately for Cranmer, told him what had passed, and desired to know in what manner he proposed to defend himself. The archbishop thanked the king for his great goodness in making him previously acquainted with the design of his enemies, and humbly intreated him to appoint such judges <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or his trial as should understand the subject on which he would be tried. Henry, smiling at his simplicity, told him he was a fool to make so light of his own safety; that, if he was once in prison, they would find abundance of false witnesse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to ruin him; and that, since he could not take care of himself, he the king would look after his affairs. He directed him to appear before the council when summoned, and plead his p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣vilege as privy co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsellor, that his accusers might be bro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace; that in case they should insist upon committing him to the Tower, he should appeal personally to the king, and produce his majesty's seal ring, which he then took from his finger, and delivered to Cranmer. Next morning, being summoned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o appear before the council, and going to the place where they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, he was kept waiting in a lobby among serv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts, to the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tonishment of all the spectators, until doctor Butts, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e king's physician, having seen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m by accident, communicated this circumstance to Henry, who forthwith sent an
<PB N="655" REF="6670"/>
order that he should be admitted. When he appeared before the board, they gave him to understand they had received divers informations, affirming that all the heresies in England sprung from him and his chaplains. He, in his answer, conformed to the king's direction; and, perceiving them bent upon committing him to the Tower, told them he was sorry to be so used by those with whom he had sat so long at the same board. So saying, he presented the ring, at sight of which they were astonished and confounded, and repaired in a body to the king, who chid them severely for having treated the primate of England in such an unworthy manner. He said he thought he had a wiser council than now he found they were. He laid his hand upon his breast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and declared, by the faith <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e owed to God, that he believed the archbishop was the most faithful of all his subjects. The duke of Norfolk endeavoured to excuse their conduct, by saying that all they intended was a trial, by which the arch∣bishop's innocence wouid have been vindicated, so as to free him from all fu∣ture aspersions. Henry replied with a frown, he would not suffer persons who were so dear to him, to be handled in that fashion: he said he knew their fac∣tions and malice, and was resolved to extinguish the one and punish the other without mercy. In the mean time he commanded them to be reconciled to Cranmer, and the ceremony was performed in his presence.</P>

<P>The popish party were not so discouraged by this miscarriage, but that they attempted another stroke of still greater importance. The queen was a favourer of the reformation; and sermons were often preached in her apartments by ministers of that persuasion. The king was apprised of these par∣ticulars, at which he connived. He was even indulgent enough to bear her disputing with him on points of religion; and sometimes her zeal got the better o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her discretion. One evening she had proceeded so far, that he was exaspe∣rated at her petulance: perhaps his vanity was mortified by her foiling him in the way of argument. When she quitted the apartment, he complained of her presumption to Gardiner, who fed his resentment with malicious insmuations; and, associating the chancellor in his design, represented the queen and her principal ladies as heretics who favoured the innovators, and had corresponded with Anne Askew. They even a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>firmed they were traitors as well as heretics, and inflamed Henry's passions in such an artful manner, that he subscribed certain articles against the queen, intended as the foundation of an impeach∣ment. The chancellor, chancing to drop this paper, it was found by a person who delivered it to Catherine. She no sooner saw the king's subscription than she concluded herself ruined, and was overwhelmed with fear and consternation. The agitation of her mind produced violent fits, of which Henry being in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed, visited her in her chamber, and spoke to her with such expressions of tenderness, as greatly contributed to her recovery. Next night she waited upon the king in his apartment; and, he turning the conversation upon reli∣gious disputes, she said, that, conscious of the weakness of her sex, she, as in duty bound, would submit in these and all other points to his superior judg∣ment. Henry, still piqued at her former opposition, replied, "Not so, by St. Mary! you are become a doctor, Kate, to instruct, not to be instructed." She then very artfully assured him, that she should never have presumed to argue with him on any subject, except to amuse the pain of his infirmities, or with a view to profit by his superior learning. Hearing this declaration, <Q>“Is i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

even so, sweetheart (cried he) then we are perfect friends again.”</Q> He, at parting, embraced her with great cordiality, assuring her she might depend upon his affection. Next day, while he walked with her in the garden the chancellor appeared with a guard assembled, to conduct her and several other ladies to the Tower.

<P>The protestants had still more cause to triumph in the ruin of the duke of Norfolk, who had been their most powerful and implacable enemy. The duke was a nobleman who had served the king with talents and fidelity; and his son, the earl of Surry, was a young gentleman of great courage and vivacity, though not without a tincture of pride, vanity, and affectation. The family was not only powerful in its own strength, but rendered still more im∣portant by being at the head of the popish party. Of course it became for∣midable to the earl of Hertford and Sir Thomas Seymour, who pretended to the management of affairs in case of the king's decease. They knew the en∣mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y which the Howards bore them, and dreaded their competition in a mino∣rity. They persuaded Henry that the earl of Surry aspired at a marriage with the princess Mary, in which case he might embroil the government of young Edward. They even hinted he had designs upon the crown, and bore the arms of Edward the Confessor, without any badge of distinction and diminution. This was a string that Henry never heard touched without emotion. He re∣solved to sacrifice the family of Norfolk to the security of the succession. That unhappy family was divided in itself. The dutchess, who had lived some years in a state of separation from her husband, turned informer against him: his supposed concubine, Mrs. Holland, acted the same treacherous part. His daughter, Mary dutche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dowager of Richmond, was at variance with her brother the earl of Surry, and enlisted herself among the number of his accusers, the chief o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom was Sir Richard Southwell, who charged him with infidelity to the king. The earl denied the charge, and challenged Southwell to single combat: indeed the whole imputation brought against this noble family, amounted to no more than some hasty express<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons of di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>content, and the earl's bearing the arms of Edward the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essor, while his father used those of Eng∣land, with a distinction of labels of silver, which were peculiar to the prince of Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. These armorial bearings had been authorized by the heralds; and, for a series of years, observed by the king, without giving offence: but, now that a pretence was wanting for the ruin of the Howards, they were deemed sufficient grounds for an attainder. The earl of Surry was tried by a common jury, convicted, notwithstanding the excellent de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence he made, condemned, and beheaded on Tower-hill. The father endeavoured to mollify the king by letters and submissions; but Henry's heart was not at all subject to tender im∣pressions. The parliament meeting on the fourteenth day of January, a bill of attai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der was brought against the duke of Nor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, who could not have

been convicted on a fair hearing before his peers; and this passing, received the royal assent from the lord chancellor, the earl of Hertford, and the lords St. John and Russel, joined in commission under the great seal for that purpose. The death-warrant was immediately sent to the lieutenant of the Tower, and the duke would have been beheaded next morning, had not an event of greater consequence to the kingdom intervened, and prevented the execution.</P>

<P>Henry had for some time perceived himself fast approaching the goal of life. On the eleventh day of December he had established the noble foundation of Trinity College in Cambridge; and on the thirtieth day of the same month, he made his will, bequeathing the crown to his son prince Ed∣ward and his issue; failing which, to his daughters Mary and Elizabeth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in default of whom and their issue, to the heirs of his nieces Frances and Eleanor, daughters of his sister Mary late queen of France; and after them, to the next lawful heir: so that the children of his elder sister Margaret queen of Scotland, were excluded from their rank in the succession. He willed that his own daugh∣ters should forfeit their right of succession, should they marry without consent of the privy council. In the mean time, to each of them he left ten thou∣sand pounds, by way of dower, and three thousand for their subsistence, until they should be married. The queen was intit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led to three thousand pounds in plate, and one thousand in money, over and above her jointure. He left six hun∣dred pounds a-year in land, to the dean and chapter of Windsor, for the main∣tenance of thirteen poor knights, and other pious uses. His executors were directed to pay his debts, repair any injuries he might have unknowingly com∣mitted, and confirm all his grants and promises not perfected at the time of his decease. Legacies were left to each of his executors, and many of his faithful servants. On the third day of January, he passed a grant of St. Bartholemew's Hospital, with the scite of Christ's church, and five hundred marks a-year to the city of London. Though Henry believed his malady was incurable, per∣haps he did not think death was so very near; and no person would venture to tell him his situation, until Sir Anthony Denny, out of christian compassion, exhorted him to take care of his soul, as he, in all probability, had not many hours of life to enjoy. He thanked him for his charitable candour, owned he had been a great sinner; but, expressed his confidence in the mercies of Christ. When Denny proposed a ghostly director, he desired him to send for archbi∣shop Cranmer, who had retired to Croyden, that he might not be present, nor concerned in the scandalous bill of attainder against the duke of Norfolk, who had always been his enemy. Before he reached the palace, Henry was speech∣less, though not insensible; for, when the archbishop desired him to make some sign of his dying in the faith of Christ, he squeezed his hand with seeming fervour, and in a few minutes expired, on the twenty-eighth day of January,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

of youth, and possessed agood understanding, which was not much improved by the nature of hiseducation. Instead of learning that philosophy which opens the mind, and extends the qualitiesof the heart, he wasconfined to the study of gloomy and scholastic disquisitions, which served to cramp the ideas, and pervert the facul∣ties of reason, qualifying him for the disputant of a cloister, rather than the law∣giver of a people. In the first years of his reign, his pride and vanity seemed to domi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> over all his other passions; though from the beginning he was i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>petuous, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eadstr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> impatient of contradiction and advice. He was rash, arrogant, prodigal, vain-glorious, pedantic and superstitious. He delighted in pomp and pageantry, the baubles of a weak mind. His passions soothed by adulation, rejected all restraint; and as he was an utter stranger to the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner feelings of the soul, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e gratified them at the expence of justice and humanity, without remo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se or comp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction. He wrested the supremacy from the bishop of Rome, partly on conscientious motives, and partly for reasons of state and convenience. He suppressed the monasteries in order to supply his extravagance with their spoils; but, he would not have made those acquisitions so easily, had not they been productive of advantage to his nobility, and agreeable to the nation in general. He was frequently at war, but the greatest conquest he obtained, was that over his own parliament and people. Religious disputes had divided them into two factions. As he had it in his power to make either scale preponderate, each courted his favour with the most obsequious submission, and in trimming the ballance, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e kept them both in subjection. In accustom∣ing themselves to these abject compliances, they degenerated into slaves; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e from their prostitution acquired the most despotic authority. He became rapacious, arbitrary, froward, fretful, and so cruel, that he seemed to delight in the blood of his subjects.

<P>HENRY VIII. was succeeded on the throne of England by his only son Edward VI. now in the tenth year of his age. At the time of his father's death he resided at Hertford with his sister Elizabeth, from whence he was conducted by his uncle the earl of Hertford, and Sir Thomas Brown, to the Tower of London, where he was received by the council in a body, and proclaimed king of England.

Then some of the members observing, that it would be troublesome to the people, and especially to foreign ministers, to address themselves to sixteen different persons of equal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uthority, proposed, that one of the number should be chosen as chief and president, under the title of Protector. This proposal was vehemently op∣posed by the chancellor, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oresaw the choice would fall upon the earl of Hertford, with whom he had been long at variance on account of religion. His objections, however, were over-ruled. That nobleman was chosen pro∣tector of the rea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, and governor of the king's person, on this express con∣dition, That he should do nothing without the consent of the other regents. While preparations were making for the funeral of Henry, and the coronation of his successor, the regency took an extraordinary step, on pretence of fulfilling the intentions of the late king, who had resolved to make some promotions<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wood.</NOTE> among his courtiers. Evidence was examined touching the particulars of Henry's design, and in consequence of their depositions, the earl of Hertford was created duke of Somerset; the earl of E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ex made marquis of Northamp∣ton; the title of earl of Warwick was conferred upon Dudley lord viscount de Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e; chancellor Wriothesley was promoted to the earldom of Southampton; Sir Thomas Seymour was created baron Sudley; and Rich, Willoughby, and<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> Sheffield, were erected into barons of the same appellations. At the same time the duke of Somerset was created treasurer and marechal, vacant by the condemnation of the duke of Norfolk; and his brother the new baron Sudley, was appointed admiral of England. After the obsequies of the late king, they proceeded to the coronation of Edward, which was performed on the twentieth day of February; and on this occasion an amnesty was published, from which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owever, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of Norfolk, cardinal Pole, Edward Courtney, eldest son of the marquis of Exeter, and three other persons, were excluded.</P>

<P>The lord chancellor being a man of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iery, ambitious, turbulent dis∣position, whose politics and religion were very different from those of the pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ector, this la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t resolved to seize the first opportunity to expel him from the re∣gency; and he soon furnished him with a pretence. He granted a commis∣sion under the great seal to certain substitutes, to hear and decide causes in chancery in the same manner as if he himself were present. And this step he took of his own simple authority, without the consent of the king, or other regents. The council being apprized of the affair, ordered the judges of the realm to give their opinions on the subject; and they unanimously dec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red, that the chancellor could not delegate his power to any other persons without the consent of the king and regency; otherwise he forfeited his office, and became liable to fine and imprisonment. When he was made acquainted w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th this declaration in full council, he inveighed against the judges, and even<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> reviled the council and protector. In a word, his behaviour incensed the mem∣bers
<PB N="661" REF="6730"/>
to such a degree, that he was confined to his own house, and deprived of the great seal, which was put into the hands of the lord St. John, until another chancellor could be appointed: but, the earl of Southampton was afterwards released on his giving security for the payment of the fine to which he should be condemned. Somerset having removed this troublesome opponent, gave his colleagues to understand, that the French ambassador, and other foreign envoys, desired to be satisfied concerning the extent of his power, before they would treat with him on the subjects of their several embassies; and therefore, it would be necessary that his protectorship should be established by patent. They thought the proposal was reasonable, and joined him in a petition to the king, who by patent constituted the duke of Somerset governor of his person, and protector of his realm and subjects. All the executors, except the earl of South∣ampton, were with the twelve additional counsellors, assigned to him for a council; but they were restrained from doing any thing without his consent and advice; whereas he was impowered to swear of the council any person he should think proper for that station, and in conjunction with any number of the counsellors which he might choose, to convene, annul, or change whatever they should think proper to alter or abolish. Thus he made himself absolutely master of the government, though in so doing, he intailed upon himself the hatred and envy of many other noblemen, by which he suffered severely in the sequel.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>Since the death of Henry, two new treaties had been concluded with France. The first was a renewal of alliance between Francis and Edward; and the other related to the limits of the territory of Boulogne, and the fortifica∣tions which the two kings had erected in the neighbourhood of that place. It was agreed, That the English might finish the works they had begun at Boulemberg, Blackness, and Ambleteuse: and, That the French should have the same liberty with respect to those at St. Etienne; but discontinue their works at Portet and La Pointe. But, Francis dying before the ratification of this treaty, the politics of the court of France assumed another aspect under Henry II. his successor. The protector of England was no sooner informed of the death of Francis, than he dispatched a courier to Nicholas Wotton the English ambassador at Paris, directing him to receive the ratification of the new king, and see him swear to the observance of the treaties. By this time<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub. Ninan.</NOTE> the interest of the cardinal of Lorraine, and the duke of Guise, predominated at the court of France; and being devoted to the old religion, they exerted all their power in preventing the marriage between young Edward and their niece the queen of Scotland. They persuaded Henry, that it was his interest to re∣cover Boulogne at any rate; and therefore he not only refused to ratify the treaties, but even disowned the ambassador whom his father had sent to Lon∣don. Thus the unsettled limits of the territory of Boulogne, and the new for∣tifications, remained a subject of contention between the two crowns; and from Henry's refusing to confirm the alliance, it plainly appeared his intention was to infringe the treaty.</P>

<P>The eyes of Henry VIII. were no sooner closed, than the friends of the reformation congratulated themselves on the event. They no longer sup∣pressed their sentiments on religion; but, maintained their doctrines openly in preaching and teaching, even while the laws against them continued in full
<PB N="662" REF="6740"/>
force. Indeed, they had at this juncture very little to fear from their adver∣saries. The king himself was bred up in the reformed religion by his preceptor doctor Coxe, and had already given surprizing proofs of genius, capacity, and an amiable disposition, averse to cruelty and persecution. The protector pro∣fessed the same doctrines, which were espoused by Cranmer of Canterbury, Hol∣gate of York, Holbech of Lincoln, Goodrick of Ely, doctor Ridley, and Lati∣mer, who was by this time released from prison. The protestants in Germany had received a private supply of fifty thousand crowns from the regency, which resolved to seize this favourable conjuncture for promoting the reformation. With this view they appointed visitors to examine all the churches, and impow∣ered them to abolish certain gross abuses which had crept into the worship,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> particularly that of images.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>The next affair that ingrossed the protector's attention was the war with Scotland. Henry had on his death-bed laid strong injunctions upon his exe∣cutors to effect, if possible, the match between Edward and Mary; and as the French party prevailed in Scotland, there was no prospect of executing what he had so much at heart, in any other way but by force of arms: the protector therefore began to make preparations for prosecuting the war in Scotland, while the French king declared, that he would not abandon his antient allies in their distress. At the desire of the French ambassador, the duke of Somerset consented to try the effect of a negotiation, before hostilities should be com∣menced. Conferences were opened on the fourth day of August; and Tonstal, chief of the English plenipotentiaries, was directed to break up the congress immediately, if the Scottish ambassadors had no power to consent to the mar∣riage. Accordingly, as no such power was vested in them, the negotiation proved fruitless. The protector therefore entered Scotland in the beginning of September with an army of fifteen thousand infantry, and three thousand horse, well appointed, provided with a train of artillery. John Dudley earl of Warwick was the protector's lieutenant; and the cavalry was commanded by lord Gray, lord Dacres, and Sir Francis Bryan. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egent of Scotland, alarmed at this invasion, ordered the fire-cross to be carried through all parts of the realm, and made proclamation, that all men above sixteen years of age, and under sixty, should resort to Mussleburgh with arms and provision. Thus summoned, a great number appeared at the place of rendezvous; so that the regent dismissed a great superfluity, after having retained an army of thirty thousand men, well sup∣plied with arms, ammunition, and ordnance. They took post near Mussleburgh within four miles of Edinburgh, in order to attack the English in their march; and the duke of Somerset encamped at the village of Prestonpans, at the distance of about two miles from their front. While the two armies lay in this situa∣tion, the Scottish regent detached best part of his cavalry to insult the English quarters, and these being encountered by the lord Gray, and Sir Francis Bryan, were totally defeated, after an obstinate and furious engagement, in which the lord Home, and about eight hundred Scots, were left dead upon the field. Next day a trumpeter came with an insolent message from the Scottish general, permitting the protector to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etire in peace to his own country; and proposing from the lord Huntley, that the quarrel should be decided by twenty against twenty, ten against ten, or by single combat between himself and the duke of Somerset. A proper answer was made to this bravado by the protector, and
<PB N="663" REF="6750"/>
the earl of Warwick begged leave, that he might be allowed to accept of Hunt∣ley's challenge: but the duke would not grant his permission; and it afterwards appeared that Huntley had sent no such message. Before the protector would engage the enemy, he sent a letter to the Scottish regent, assuring him his intention was not to hurt the realm of Scotland, but rather to defend it, by promoting an union of the two kingdoms on fair and honourable terms, by virtue of the marriage to which the Scottish parliament had agreed in the most solemn manner. He pointed out the advantages that would accrue to Scot∣land from such a match. He proposed, that if all the nobility of the kingdom were not inclined to a peace upon such terms, hostilities should cease until the queen should be of age to choose for herself.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>The regent communicated these honourable proposals to his brother John archbishop of St. Andrew's, and a few other individuals, who being elated with the hope of victory, advised him to conceal them from the rest of the nobility; and in the mean time, disfused a report through the whole army, that the Eng∣lish were come to carry off the queen, and enslave the country. The sol∣diers believed this insinuation, and took to their arms in a tumultuary manner. Understanding that the English were in motion, they passed the river Esk, and took possession of a rising-ground, while the protector wheeled about, and encamped upon the hill of Pinkencleuch, near the side of the frith, where their fleet lay at anchor. The enemy imagining he intended to reimbark, quitted their advantgeous ground in order to attack them, and this precipitate step was the cause of their destruction. The English began to be in want of provision, and had the Scots maintained their post, the protector could not have retreated without exposing his army to the most imminent danger. But, the impetuosity of the enemy saved him the risque of any such disaster. On the tenth day of September they divided their forces into three bodies. The first under the command of the earl of Angus, was flanked on the right with four or five pieces of artillery, and on the left with about four hundred horsemen. The second line was commanded by the regent. The third by the earl of Argyle, who had brought into the field four thousand Highlanders; and these were disposed on the left flanks of the second and third bodies. The protector seeing them abandon their post, congratulated himself upon the event; and caused his army to be drawn up in order of battle. The van was commanded by the earl of Warwick, and took post on the side of the hill, where the great artillery was posted. The main body, under the general, was drawn up partly on the hill, and partly on the plain; and the rear was extended on the plain, at some distance from the van and center. The lord Gray, who commanded the men at arms, was posted on the left wing, so as to flank the Scots; but, forbidden to charge until the front of both armies should be engaged. The enemy advancing along shore, were galled from an English galley, the shot of which killed the lord Graham, and threw the Highlanders into confusion. The lord Gray perceiving their disorder, advanced immediately to charge the enemy's van in flank; but, met with such a warm reception from their spearmen, that he himself was dan∣gerously wounded; and as the action happened in broken ground, his men at arms were actually routed, and the standard in great danger of being lost. Had the Scots been furnished with horse to pursue this advantage, in all probability, the English would have been intirely defeated; though the wind and sun were

The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e were sustained by the archers, who shot their arrows over the heads of the musqueteers; at the same time, the artillery planted on the hill on the left, and the ordnance o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the galley anchored close to the sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on the left, made such havock amongst th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, that they fell in heaps, withou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> having it in their power to annoy their enemies. In this dis∣tress, their van fell back a little, in hope of drawing the English over the slough and broken ground, that they might have an opportunity of acting hand to hand; but the Highlanders in the second line, imagining their front was defeated, betook themselves to flight in a body: and this circumstance overwhelmed t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir whole army with consternation. Disorder and rout immedi∣ately ensued. The Scots threw down their arms, and fled in the utmost consu∣sion. Then the English cavalry being rallied, fell in among the fugitives, and meeting with no resistance, made such a terrible carnage, that they lay like sheep in a field of pasture. The whole surface of the ground was strewed with spears and swords; the river Esk, and several petty brooks were swelled with the blood of the slain, which amounted to fourteen thousand, insomuch, that when the slaughter was over, the very soldiers were asham<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of their own cruelty; for the English did not lose above fifty horsemen, and their infantry did not strike a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>roke. About three thousand ecclesia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tics, who made a separate body for themselves, were ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acred without mercy. Fifteen hundred of the vanquished were taken prisoners, and among these the earl of Huntley, the lords Yester, Hamilton, and Wemys, together with the master of Sempil. Nor was this the only overthrow which the Scots sustained in the course of this year. While the regent's attention was wholly turned against the duke of So∣merset, the lord Wharton, and the earl of Lennox entering Scotland by the western Marches, took several forts, and ravaged the whole country; so that the earl of Bothwell, and many gentlemen of Tevio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dale, and the Merse, rather than be continually harrassed by these depredations, submitted to the king of England, and were received into his protection. The duke of Somerset, had he taken advantage of the consternation which filled all Scotland immediately af<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the battle of Musle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urgh or Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>key, might have subdued the whole coun∣try without any further opposition. But, he was prevented from re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ping the fruits of his success by the intri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues of his brother in England.

The lord Rich was created chancellor; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> parliament meeting on the fourth day of November, manifested the utmost attachment to the protector. They repealed all the acts touching high treason, which h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d passed since the reign of the third Edward; all acts of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elony spe∣cified since the rupture with the pope; the statute which vested the king's procla∣mation with the power of an act of parliament; two acts passed against the Lollards; and the famous statute of the six articles. The king's supremacy was confirmed a-new; and the pains of treason were decreed against those heirs of the crown mentioned in Henry's will, who should attempt to disturb the order of the succession: their adherents and abettors were likewise subjected to the same penalties. The benefit of the clergy, and the privileges of sanctuary were restored; from these however, assassins, and four sorts of thieves were ex∣cluded. It was decreed, That the act impowering Henry's successor to annul the laws made in his minority, should take place with regard to what should be done hereafter, but not in that which had been already transacted. Private masses were prohibited, and the people permitted to receive the communion in both species. The king was impowered to fill vacant bishoprics; so that sham elections were intirely abolished. The cognizance of marrimonial and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sta∣mentary causes was transferred from the ecclesiastical courts to those of the regal jurisdiction; and they passed a law, enacting, That if any common person should refrain from working, or at least from offering to work for the space of three days, he should be branded in the face with a red hot iron, and become the slave of the informer. This rigorous decree was levelled against the monks, who since the dissolution of the monasteries, instead of working for their liveli∣hood, strolled from family to family, and endeavoured to breed disturbance in the state. Nevertheless, this law was not rigorously executed, and soon repealed by a subsequent parliament. Finally, they granted to Edward all the foundations for chantries, chapels, and colleges, of which Henry had not al∣ready taken possession. This act met with great opposition from several pre∣lates, and from Cranmer in particular. He hoped to find some opportunity<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward. Burnet.</NOTE> for converting those benefactions to religious purposes; whereas, by being in the hands of the king, the church would be deprived of them for ever. But, he was not able to carry his point. The nobility thirsted after the effects of the church, and these they easily obtained from the court: and the executors of Henry's will wanted money to pay his debts and legacies. The session was
<PB N="666" REF="6780"/>
concluded with an act of amnesty, from which, however, the prisoners in the Tower were excluded; but as Gardiner had been confined in the Fleet, he en∣joyed the benefit of the statute.</P>

<P>Among those who envied the protector, was his own brother Tho∣mas the adm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral, a man of uncommon talents, though proud, turbulent, and untractable. He could not endure the distinction which king Henry had made between him and his elder brother, with whom he thought himself equally in∣titled to a snare in the administration. He had addressed himself to the prin∣cess Elizabeth on the subject of marriage, but seeing no prospect of succeed∣ing in that p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsuit, he insinuated himself into the affection of the queen dow∣ager, who gave him her hand in private, immediately after the death of her former husband. He found means to obtain from the king a letter, expressing his de∣sire that s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch a match should be effected; and then he published his marriage, in open defiance of the protector. His next step was to cabal and make a party among the nobility, who, as they hated his brother, fomented his ambition. He bribed the king's domestics to his interest; and young Edward frequently went to his house, on pretence of visiting his mother-in-law. There he ingra∣tiated himself with his sovereign, by an affected affability, officious complaisance, and supplying him with money to distribute among his servants and favourites, without the knowledge of his governor. The protector being informed of these insidious proceedings, expostulated with him on the baseness of his con∣duct, and he answered in such a manner as gave the duke to understand, he had nothing to hope from his brotherly affection. In the protector's absence, he redoubled all his art and insinuation, and obtained a new patent for admiral, with an additional appointment. Sir William Paget perceiving the progress he daily made in the king's affection, wrote to the duke on the subject; and he finished the campaign in Scotland with all possible dispatch, that he might re∣turn in time to counterwork his machinations. But, before he arrived in Eng∣land, the admiral had engaged in his party some privy counsellors, several no∣blemen of distinction, and a great number of the members of the lower house of parliament. He prevailed upon the king to write a letter to the two houses with his own hand, desiring the admiral might be appointed his gover∣nor; but, before this was delivered, the council being apprized of his design, sent deputies to assure him, if he did not desist, they would deprive him of his office, se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him prisoner to the Tower, and prosecute him on the laft act of parliament, by which he was subjected to the penalty of high treason, for at∣tempting to disturb the order of government. Thus intimidated, he h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbled himself before the council; and was seemingly reconciled to the protector. Yet<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> he still nourished the same design in secret, and his brother suspecting his senti∣ments, employed spies to inform him of all his secret transactions.</P>

The archbishop of Cologne, who had embraced that religion, saw himself compelled to renounce the double dignity of archbishop and elector. The pope<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

It forbade the use of candles<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleidan.</NOTE> on Candlemas day, palms on Palm sunday, and creeping to the cross on Good∣friday. It left the people at liberty to practise or lay aside auricular confession; and ordered all the images to be removed from churches. All the popish party were alarmed at these changes, which produced great murmurings amongst the priests and people of the old religion; and when the proclamation, that confirmed these changes, was published, Gardiner inveighed against it openly, on his old maxim, that there should be no innovation during the king's mi∣nority. Being summoned again before the council, he submitted to the autho∣rity of the board, and was ordered to preach a sermon at St. Paul's, maintain∣ing that the king's authority was the same before as after his majority, He performed this task so little to the satisfaction of the regency, that they com∣mitted him to the Tower, and this act of severity intimidated the whole party to such a degree, that they conformed to the new ordinance without further hesitation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et.</NOTE></P>

<P>The protector had offered a truce for ten years to the regent of Scotland; but that nobleman, being entirely governed by French councils, rejected his proposals, in hope of being previously succoured by the king of France; so that the duke of Somerset, being obliged to continue the war, took a number of Landsquenets into his pay, and appointed the earl of Shrewsbury his lieutenant. The regent of Scotland opened the campaign with the siege of Broughty-castle, which he could not reduce; while the English troops fortified Haddington and Lauder, and made incursions to the gates of Edinburgh. In the month of May the regent, receiving a reinforcement of six thousand men and some ar∣tillery from France, under the command of Dessé d'Espanvilliers, reinvested Broughty, which he took, putting all the garrison to the sword. The queen mother passionately desired that young Mary should be educated in the French court, where her two brothers had such influence; and the king of France, in order to facilitate the consent of the regent, created him duke of Chateleraut, with a yearly revenue of two thousand livres. Thus gratified, he allowed the young queen to be put on board of the fleet which brought over the soldiers; and this sailing north about round the Orkneys and Ireland, landed her safely in Bretagne, from whence she was conducted to Paris. The French ships made this circuit in order to avoid the English navy under admiral Seymour, who cruised in the frith of Edinburgh, and landed in several parts of Fife; but was, by the gallantry of Dun, repulsed with disgrace. By this time the Scots and French undertook the siege of Haddington, and carried on their operations vigorously until the English forces approaching under the command of the earl of Shrewsbury, they abandoned the enterprize. The earl, having thrown into the place a supply of men, provision, and ammunition, advanced to Mussle∣burgh, where the enemy lay intrenched, and offered them battle; which they not choosing to accept, he suddenly retired to England. Immediately after his departure, Dessé, the French general attempted to surprize Haddington;
<PB N="668" REF="6800"/>
but the garrison, being seasonably alarmed, obliged him to retreat with great loss and precipitation, even after part of his troops had entered the town. The English in this place were occasionally relieved by the garrison of Berwick, until Sir Thomas Palmer, with fifteen hundred horse, was routed and taken; the greater part of his followers being slain. In order to compensate for this disaster the lord Gray entered Scotland by the west, and ravaged Teviotdal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Liddesdale, from whence he carried off great booty. At length, the pro∣tector, perceiving that he could not maintain Haddington without exposing his troops to unnecessary danger, detached the earl of Rutland with six thousand men to demolish the fortifications, and bring off the artillery. This service was performed without loss, and the earl, in his retreat to Berwick, laid waste the country: but, at the same time, the Scots took the castle of Hume by sur∣prize, and all the English in the place were either killed or taken.</P>

<P>At this conjuncture a quarrel happened between the pope and the em∣peror. Charles protested against the translation of the council to Bologna; and the pope rejected his protest. Then the emperor, to shew his indepen∣dence, proposed articles of accommodation to the protestants. These were known by the appellation of Interim, because they were no other than expe∣dients to be used, until a council could be held in some town of Germany.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dan.</NOTE> Though the expressions were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oftened, they at bottom contained almost all the doctrines of the Roman church: yet they allowed that a man's marriage should be no objection to his receiving the order of priesthood; and that the communion, in both species, should not be with-held from those who might demand it in that manner. This Interim was presented in a diet convoked at Augsburg, and enacted into a decree, notwithstanding the protests of several towns of the empire. While the emperor thus endeavoured to crush the refor∣mation in Germany, it gained ground every day in England under the pro∣tection of Cranmer and the ministry. The parliament meeting on the twenty∣fourth day of November, enacted a statute, by which priests were permitted to marry; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by another confirmed the new liturgy, on which commissioners<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. of the Reformation.</NOTE> had been employed in the summer.

<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>The protector had nothing more at heart than the progress of this work, though he was obliged to proceed gradually, because the greatest part of the inferior clergy was still attached to the old religion, and he himself had a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1549<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> great number of enemies, among whom his own brother was the most violent and dangerous. The queen dowager, having died in September of the prece∣ding year, the admiral renewed his addresses to the princess Elizabeth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but as the will of the late king expresly excluded her from the succession, should she marry without the consent of her father's executors, he contrived a scheme for gratifying his ambition in another manner. He is said to have formed the de∣sign of making himself master of the king's person<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and seizing the reins of government into his own hands: for the execution of which project he had as∣sembled two thousand men in different places. The council, having received <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome intimation of his practices against the government, committed him pri∣soner to the Tower, and appointed commissioners to take the depositions of his accusers. These taxed him with having conspired against the administration, protected pyrates, and committed acts of violence against the subjects of dif∣ferent
<PB N="669" REF="6810"/>
states which were at peace with England. The protector, perceiving that his authority would be precarious as long as his brother had any share in the government, exhorted him to resign his office and retire from court; but finding him deaf to his remonstrance, he resolved to sacrifice him to his own saf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty. His accusation was reduced to three and thirty articles; and certain members of the council were sent to interrogate him on the particulars. He refused to answer, demanding a legal trial, and that he might be brought face to face with his accusers. Next day the council repaired to the Tower in a body, when he still insisted on his former demand, which, however, was not granted. Then he desired they would leave the articles of his accusation, that he might examine him at his leisure, and prepare for his defence: this request was likewise denied. The council then re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olved that he should be condemned in parliament by an act of attainder. In the mean time it appointed com∣missioners to hear what he had to say in his own defence. The king was per∣suaded to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignify his disapprobation of the admiral; and, the commissioners making their report, a bill of attainder was brought into the house of peers. It accused him of an attempt to seize the person of the king, and the govern∣ment of the realm; of laying up great store of provision and money; of en∣deavouring to espouse the lady Elizabeth, and of persuading the king in his tender age to take upon himself the administration of affairs. The bill passed both houses with very little opposition; and received the royal assent. The admiral was beheaded on the tenth day of March, contrary to the sense of the nation in general, who thought the articles of accusation frivolous in them∣selves;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haywood.

<P>At this juncture the kingdom was exposed to very dangerous com∣motions, which had been brewing since the late reign. When the monasteries were suppressed, a prodigious number of monks were obliged to earn their sub∣sistence by their labour; so that every species of business was overstocked. The lands of the monasteries had been formerly farmed out to common people, so as to employ a great number of hands; and, the rents being moderate, they were enabled to maintain their families on the profits of agriculture: but now, these
<PB N="670" REF="6820"/>
lands being possessed by the nobility, the rents were raised; and the farmers, perceiving that wool was a better commodity than corn, turned all their fields into past<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re-ground. This practice was attended with divers inconveniences. The price o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meal increased, to the unspeakable hardship of the lower class of people; and, as few hands were required to manage pasture-grounds, a great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umber of poor people was utterly deprived of subsistence; while the nation was filled with murmurs and complaints against the nobility, who were the sources of this misfortune. The protector espoused the cause of the sufferers: he appointed commissioners to examine whether or not the possessors of church∣lands fulfilled the conditions on which those lands had been sold by the crown; he demolished a royal park at Hampton-court, of which the inhabitants of that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istrict complained, and took several other steps for the relief of the common people. This conduct intailed upon him the hatred of the nobility. In the last session of parliament the lords had projected an act, impowering the pos∣sessors of church-lands to farm them in any manner they should think proper; but the bill was rejected by the lower house. Nevertheless, the lords continued to inclose their grounds, and the peasants imagined their design was to reduce them again to servitude. On this supposition, the common people of Wilt∣shire and Somersetshire, assembling in a great body, began to pull down the enclosures; but they were soon dispersed by Sir William Herbert, afterwards earl of Pembroke. Insurrections happened at the same time in Sussex, Hamp∣shire, Kent, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Leicester∣shire, Worcestershire, and Rutlandshire: these however were appeased by the interposition of moderate persons.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>This storm was scarce overblown, when still more dangerous com∣motions were excited in Oxfordshire, Devonshire, Norfolk, and Yorkshire. Into the first of these counties the protector detached the lord Gray with fifteen hundred horse and foot, who, falling upon them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew a great number; and of the prisoners divers were executed. The insurgents of Devonshire, amounting to the number of ten thousand, were headed by one Humphrey Arundel, an experienced soldier, and encouraged by the sermons of some ecclesiastical in∣cendiaries. They sent a set of articles to the king, demanding that curates should administer baptism at all times of necessity: That their children might be confirmed by the bishops whensoever they should resort unto him: That the mass should be celebrated without any man's communication with the priest: That they might have a reserve of the Lord's body in their churches: That they might have holy bread and holy water: That God's service might be said and sung with an audible voice in the choir: That priests should live in celibacy: and, That the six articles should be u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed as they were in the time of Henry, until the king should be of age. These demands the ministry answered by a formal manifesto, concluding with an offer of a general pardon, should they return to their own homes: but the popish monks among them, who had already converted this rebellion into a religious affair, persuaded them that this lenity was the effect of fear; that the ministry intended to tax their sheep and cattle, and raise an excise upon all their drink and provision. Thus insti∣gated, they undertook the siege of Exeter, which was g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llantly defended by the inhabi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ants. John lord Russel, privy seal, had been sent against them with a sm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l body of forces, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken up his quarters at Hon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom whence he

marched to the relief of Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, in hope of being able to throw succours into the town: but the insurgents had taken such precautions as baffled his endea∣vours; and, in his retreat, he found himself encompassed by a great number, through which he fought his way back to Honiton. The citizens of Exeter were reduced to great extremity, when the lord Gray joined the lord Russel with a strong reinforcement. Then they marched towards Exeter, routed the rebels with great slaughter, and relieved the city, which was recompenced for its loyalty with an addition of revenue, and an extension of its liberties. The insurgents, not yet dispirited, assembled on Clifton-heath, with a crucifix in a covered waggon, adorned with tapers and trompery; and they were again charged by the lord Gray, who made a terrible carnage. Their ringleaders were taken and hanged, and several innocent persons afterwards suffered from the cruelty of Sir Anthony Kingston, provost marshal of the king's army.</P>

<P>The sedition in Norfolk appeared still more terrible. The male∣contents increased to the number of sixteen thousand, under the conduct of one Kit a tanner, and Coniers an ecclesiastic, who performed the office of their chap∣lain. They broke down inclosures, ravaged the country, denounced vengeance against the gentlemen of the neighbourhood. They presented articles of complaint to the king, demanding, That lands and farms should be reduced to their an∣tient rents: That the price of wool should be lowered: and, That all inclosures should be taken away. The king promised that all their grievances should be redressed in parliament; and, in the mean time, offered to indulge them with an amnesty, if they would lay down their arms and disperse. They rejected this proffer with disdain, established their head-quarters at Moushold, where Kit the tanner, and a committee, sat in judgment under a large tree, since known by the name of the Oak of reformation. They undertook the siege of Norwich, which having reduced, they imprisoned the mayor and some of the principal citizens. At length, lord William Parre, marquis of Northampton, taking the field with fifteen hundred men, besides a small number of Italian musqueteers under Malatesta, marched directly towards Norwich, which the rebels had eva∣cuated. He took possession of the city without opposition; but, the insurgents giving the assault in the night, were repulsed with considerable loss. In the morning they renewed the attack with such fury, that they entered the town, and the marquis was obliged to retreat, after lord Sheffield and a good number of his men had been slain in the conflict: for the inhabitants, in general, fa∣voured the rebels; and, while the king's troops were engaged with them in the streets, annoyed them from the windows and balconies. This discomfiture of the marquis was no sooner known in London, than the earl of Warwick was sent to his assistance with six thousand infantry, fifteen hundred horse, and a train of artillery, provided for the war in Scotland. When he arrived at Norwich he s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmoned the rebels to surrender, assuring them they should have the benefit of a free pardon: but, his proposal being rejected, he planted his artillery against the town; and, a breach being made, entered by assault. One hundred and thirty of the insurgents were slain, and sixty being taken, were hanged up immediately by martial law: nevertheless, some of his waggons falling into the hands of the enemy, supplied them with ammunition, which they began to want. The execution of their confederates served only to increase their rage; they poured in like a tide at one of the gates, which was guarded with artillery;
<PB N="672" REF="6840"/>
and, notwithstanding a very obst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate opposition, carried off the canon, together with some ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of munition: even the boys behaved so desperately on this occa∣sion, that they were seen to pull out the arrows from their bodies, and deliver them to their own archers.

They refusing to accept it on these terms, he ordered his whole cavalry to attack them in the valley, where they were drawn up in some sort of order, and had placed in the front the gen∣tlemen they had taken prisoners, bound in couples, that they might bear the firit brunt of the battle. The king's troops however spared these unhappy captives, and fell upon the rebels with such vigour that they were quickly put into disorder, and began to fly with great precipitation. The pursuit was con∣tinued three miles with such slaughter, that three thousand lay dead upon the spot. Those who guarded their artillery and baggage had fortified themselves with waggons and pallisadoes, and declared they would fight to the last drop of their blood; but, upon promise of pardon from the earl's own mouth, they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward.

Kit their ringleader escaped from the field; but, being taken next day in a barn with his brother, was hung in chains on Norwich castle; his brother was hanged on Wymondham steeple, and nine of their accomplices suffered on the oak of reformation. While Nor∣folk was exposed to these commotions a third sedition broke out in Yorkshire, where William Ombler, a man of some distinction, with Thomas Dale, a parish clerk, and one Stevenson, misled by a ridiculous prophecy, assembled about three thousand people by ringing bells and firing beacons, as if the coast had been invaded, and persuaded them to take arms to restore the church to her an∣tient rights, humble the rich, relieve the poor, and redress the grievances of the nation.

The king's coffers were so empty that he could not maintain a war without demand∣ing new subsidies, which would excite fresh murmurs among the people; and the sinister accidents of war might furnish his enemies with pretences for con∣demning his conduct: besides, he foresaw that war would retard the progress of the reformation. Moved by these considerations, he proposed in council that peace with France should be procured at the expence of restoring Bou∣logne, which cost the kingdom an incredible sum of money, and wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld be a perpetual bone of contention while it remained in the hands of the English: whereas, by giving it up, they would not only secure an advantageous peace with France, but also detach that power from the interest of Scotland. The council, having taken this proposal into consideration, determined that Bou∣logne should not be restored; but that an ambassador should be sent to con∣clude an alliance with the emperor.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Sir William Paget was immediately dispatched for this purpose; and, in the mean time, the protector's enemies employed emissaries to blacken his character. They represented him as a parricide, a traitor, and a sacrilegious tyrant, who not only betrayed the interest of his country, but, in order to gra∣tify his pride, destroyed churches and tombs, that he might use the materials for building his own superb palace. They taxed him with having betrayed the forts in the Boulonnois, by leaving them unprovided for defence; with having abandoned Haddington in Scotland, seized the administration into his own hands; rejected the advice of council, mismanaged the affairs of govern∣ment; and, when Paget returned without having succeeded in his nego<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iation, they affirmed he was instructed by the protector to avoid an alliance with the emperor, that he might have a pretence for resigning Boulogne. The pro∣tector being informed of these suggestions, began to be apprehensive of a de∣sign to carry off the person of the king by corrupting his servants; and there∣fore he employed some of his own domestics near his majesty, with directions to watch over all his actions. On the sixth day of October, the lord St. John, president of the council, the earls of Southampton, Warwick, and Arundel, Sir Edward North, Sir Richard Southwell, Sir Edward Wotton, and Dr. Wotton, dean of Canterbury, repaired to the bishop of Ely's house in Holborn, to hold a council, as if there had been no other members; and the king sending secretary Petre to know the reason of their meeting, they detained him to assist at their deliberations. They began by considering the state of the king∣dom, and laid the blame of all the disorders which had happened at home, and all the losses sustained abroad, upon the protector. They declared their in∣tention was to confer with him on these subjects; but, understanding he had armed his domestics, and surrounded the king with a guard, they would not expose themselves to the violence of his designs. They sent for the mayor,
<PB N="674" REF="6860"/>
aldermen, and common-council of London, together with the lieutenant of the Tower, and forbad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them expresly to acknowledge the duke of Somerset as pro∣tector. This last promised to comply with the order; but the others made an equivocal an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer: though a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of them seemed to favour the proceedings of this commitee. The protector was no sooner informed of these transactions, than he sent the king to Windsor, and armed the inhabitants of that place and Hampton-court for his security: and next day the malecontents were joined by the chancellor, lord Riche, the marquis of Northampton, the earl of Shrew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bury, Sir Thomas Cheney, Sir John Gage, Sir Ralph Sadler, and Sir Edward Montague. Thus reinforced they wrote a letter to the king, com∣plaining of the duke of Somerset, and ordered the archbishop and Paget to take care that his majesty should be served by his own domestics. On the eighth day of October they repaired to Guildhall, where they declared their sole aim was to deliver the king from the hands of the duke of Som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rset, who minded nothing but his own private advantage; and the burghers of London answered aloud, that they would support them to the utmost of their power.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The duke, finding himself abandoned by the citizens of London, and the lieutenant of the Tower, was overwhelmed with despondence: he as∣sembled those members of the council who had not yet forsaken him, and of∣fered to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bmit to the judgment of any two of them, joined to a like number <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the malecontents. The consequence of this pusillanimous declaration was his being immediately deserted by the lord Russel, Sir Anthony Brown, Sir Anthony Wingfield, Wentworth, and Baker, speaker of the house of com∣mons. At length the malecontents declared him unworthy of being protector, and published a manifesto for the justification of their conduct. Then they wrote a letter to the king, importing, That his father had appointed them ex∣ecutors of his will and regents of the kingdom: That they had elected the duke of Somerset to exercise the office of protector, on the express condition, that he should do nothing without their approbation; but, that he had transgressed these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erms, and made himself absolute master of the government: for which reason, deeming him unworthy of the trust, they desired his majesty would allow them to execute the office with which they had been invested by the late king, and dismiss the troops which the duke of Somerset had assembled about his majesty's person. The archbishop of Canterbury and Paget advised the king and the duke to comply with the demands of the council, which had already sent deputies to Windsor to prevent the escape of the protector and some of his confidents. When Edward signified his assent to their proposals they went to him in a body, and met with a gracious reception: all the duke's friends, except Cecil, were sent to the Tower; he himself, being brought be∣fore the council, was accused of having violated the condition upon which he was chosen protector: of having treated with ambassadors, and disposed of bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hoprics and governments by his sole authority: of having held the court of requests in his own house: of having debased the current coin of the kingdom: of having published proclamations touching the inclosure of lands, contrary to the deliberations of the council: of having neglected to suppress, and even of having supported and favoured the insurrections: of having neglected to supply the forts of the Boulonnois with provision and ammunition, so that they fell into the hands of the enemy: of having endeavoured to prejudice the king against
<PB N="675" REF="6870"/>
the members of the council, by false insinuations: of having proclaimed them traitors: of having maliciously alarmed his majesty, by sending him suddenly to Windsor, thereby endangering his health: of having armed his own friends and domestics, while the king's servants were left defenceless; and of having intended to fly to Jersey or Guernesey. On these articles of impeach∣ment, which he had not time to answer, he was sent to the Tower<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the council appointed six lords to act as governors to the king, two at a time offi∣ciating alternately. Then the earl of Warwick appeared to be the principal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward.</NOTE> promoter of the protector's ruin; for the other members of the council permitted him, without the least opposition, to assume the reins of government.</P>

<P>The enemies of the reformation triumphed in the fall of Somerset, persuaded that Warwick was a catholic in his heart, as he maintained such an intimate correspondence with the earl of Southampton. Bonner and Gardiner, who continued prisoners in the Tower, wrote letters to him, congratulating him upon his having freed his country from such a tyrant; and people began to imagine the duke of Norfolk would be set at liberty. They were mistaken in their conjectures; Warwick had no religion but ambition. He knew the young king was strongly attached to the new doctrines, and it was his interest to gain the favour of his sovereign. Bonner was brought before the council, and made acquainted with the subjects of complaint laid to his charge. He was ordered to preach a sermon in St. Paul's church, maintaining that the authority of a minor king is equal to that of a king come to the age of matu∣rity. In his sermon, which was preached before a very numerous audience, he did not once mention the subject, but expatiated on the real presence in the sacrament, and inveighed against those who did not believe transubstantiation. William Latimer and John Hooper informing against him, a commission was granted to the archbishop of Canterbury, and Ridley, with the two secre∣taries of state, and the dean of St. Paul's, to try him in a summary way. His deportment, when he entered the court, was ridiculously extravagant; he pre∣tended that he did not see his judges, until they were pointed out by one of the bye-standers. When the evidences were examined, he said one talked like a goose, and another like a woodcock: he treated the court with contempt, and laughed at the people, calling them fools and dunces; Dr. Hooper, he affirmed, was an ass indeed: he told secretary Smith that he was a liar; and, being re∣primanded by Cranmer, who said he ought to be sent to prison for the inso∣lence of his behaviour, he replied, that he cared not whither they sent him, provided they did not send him to the devil; but thither he would not go. He said he had a few goods, a poor carcase, and a soul; the two former were in their power, the last was in his own. The court was several times adjourned; at length, finding his defence could not avail him, he appealed to the king, and was sent to the Marshalsea, after having reviled his judges in the most abusive terms. He was again brought before them, and solemnly deprived of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the Reformation. Act. Pub.</NOTE> bishopric of London, because he had not declared the king's power in his mi∣nority, as he was commanded by the protector and council. The earl of South∣ampton was so much mortified to find himself disappointed in the conduct of Warwick, that he retired from court without taking leave, and died of cha∣grin at his house in the country. Though the earl of Warwick was thus de∣livered from an intriguing rival, he found himself not a little perplexed by

His total destruction was prevented by his submissive behavi∣our, which le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his enemies no room to prosecute him further: so that he was re∣leased from his confinement, after having given security for his future eonduct; and in two months after his enlargement, readmitted to a place in the council.

this foreigner, plenipotentiaries were appointed on both sides, and a congress was opened in the neighbourhood of Boulogne. After some warm debates, the treaty was concluded on the following terms: That Boulogne should be restored to the king of France, who, in consideration of the improvements made in that fortress, and the expence of furnishing it with provision and muni∣tion, should pay four hundred thousand golden crowns to the king of England: That France and England should mutually give hostages for the per∣formance of these articles: That Edward should restore to the queen of Scot∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward.</NOTE> the two forts of Lauder and Douglas, which should be demolished, to∣gether with those of Aymouth and Roxburgh, that were likewise occupied by the English: That the king of England should desist from all hostilities against Scotland; but, That he should reserve to himself the power of prosecu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> his actions, demands, and pretensions against France and Scotland; while the French king, and the queen of Scotland should enjoy the same privilege with respect to their demands upon England.</P>

<P>When this treaty was brought over to London, the earl of War∣wick feigned himself sick, that he might not be obliged to sign his name to condi∣tions against which his tongue had formerly exclaimed. He could not, however, elude the reproaches of the public, who plainly perceived, that those who ac∣cepted of four hundred thousand crowns, instead of two millions, which Francis I. had engaged to pay, were the very persons who inveighed so bitterly against the protector, for barely proposing the restitution of Boulogne on reasonable terms. This consideration excited such murmurs among the people, that the earl of Warwick thought proper to divert their attention to other objects that would con∣duce more to their satisfaction. He made an inquiry into the practices of those who had embezzled the king's revenue, or been guilty of oppression in the exer∣cise of their offices. An additional motive to this inquiry was his desire to pay the king's debts. Nor did he spare his own friends whom he had used as instruments to ruin the duke of Somerset. The earl of Arundel was condemned in a heavy fine; Southwell was committed to prison; and others purchased his forbearance with round sums of money. This severity pleased the nation in general, and established Warwick's authority among the great, who perceiving the vigour with which he acted, began to dread the weight of his resentment. In the course of this year, Thirleby resigned the see of Westminster, which was reunited to that of London, and bestowed upon Ridley of Rochester. The bishopric of Norwich was given to Thirleby; that of Rochester to Poinet;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> and John Hooper was created bishop of Gloucester. Polydore Vergil, who had resided forty years in England, obtained permission to pass the rest of his days in his own country; and the king allowed him to enjoy his benefices, in consi∣deration of his having spent the best part of his life in compiling the English history.</P>

This scruple seemed so extraordinary, that some of them concluded he had lost his senses; others were apprehensive, that should

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 1551.</NOTE> In England the reformation was so agreeable to the young king, that the ministry, in order to gain his favour, countenanced and encouraged it with all their influence, while Cranmer was indefatigable in the same work. Gardiner was deposed for the same reason on account of which Bonner had been deprived of his bishopric, and sent back to the Tower, where he remained till the reign of queen Mary. A new confession of faith was finished by the commissioners appointed for that purpose, and the new liturgy was in many places corrected. The king, whose understanding far exceeded his years, began to take cognizance of different affairs. He wrote a journal of all the trans∣actions that fell under his observation; and became so zealous for the new reli∣gion, that he insisted upon its being embraced by all his subjects without di∣stinction. The princess Mary, however, would never conform to the altera∣tions which had been made; and her opposition subjected her to many morti∣fications from the council, and the king himself, whose zeal on this occasion rose almost to a spirit of persecution. His sister Elizabeth was educated in the principles of the reformation, which was afterwards brought to perfection under her administration. The princess Mary was so alarmed at the insults she had received, that she resolved to quit the kingdom, and actually concerted a scheme for that purpose with the gouvernante of the Low Countries; but her design was discovered, and measures were taken to prevent the execution of it. The earl of Warwick perceiving the king was incensed against his sister Mary, formed a project for excluding her intirely from the succession, to match Eliza∣beth in a foreign country, and effect a marriage between one of his own sons and lady Jane Gray, eldest daughter of the earl of Dorset, and Francis Bran∣don, who in the order of succession held the next place to the two daughters of Henry. For this purpose, the earl of Warwick contracted an intimacy of friendship with Dorset; and two successive dukes of Suffolk of the family of Brandon being cut off by the sweating-sickness, which now raged in England, the title was conferred upon the earl of Dorset. Yet it will be found difficult to reconcile this project of Warwick to his negotiation for the marriage of the king with the daughter of Henry II. the French monarch. The marquis of Northampton, the bishop of Ely, and some other persons of distinction, were sent ambassadors to France, with the order of the garter for Henry; and the proposal of a match between his daughter Elizabeth and the king of England. Commissioners were immediately appointed to treat with them on this subject, and the treaty was signed at Angers; but Edward died before the princess
<PB N="679" REF="6910"/>
was of age. In the mean time, Henry returned the compliment, by sending<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the marechal de Montmorency at the head of a splendid embassy, with the order of St. Michael, to the king of England.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>Immediately after these transactions, the earl of Warwick was created duke of Northumberland; nor were his intimate friends forgot in this promotion. William Pawlet earl of Wiltshire and lord high treasurer, received the title of marquis of Winchester, and Sir William Herbert was created earl of Pembroke. The new duke did not think his authority was perfectly secured during the life of the duke of Somerset, who made great progress in retrieving the king's favour; and actually began to take measures for reassumiug the office of protector. In order to prevent the elevation of such a powerful rival, Northumberland resolved to ruin him effectually. He found means by artful insinuations to alienate the king's affection from that nobleman; and then by repeated insults, provoked him to take such measures as furnished a handle to work his destruction. Somerset's patience being exhuasted, he is said to have contrived a scheme for assassinating this troublesome upstart. One of his confidents, called Sir Thomas Palmer, betrayed his private conversation, and declared, in the king's hearing, that the duke of Somerset had laid a plan for assassinating the duke of Northumberland, the marquis of Northampton, and the earl of Pembroke. The evidence of this person, who was a man of an infamous character, was corroborated by the confession of one Crane; another of the name of Hammond owned that the duke's chamber had been strongly watched by night at Greenwich; and the lord Strange voluntarily declared, that Somerset desired he would persuade the king to marry his third daughter, and act as a spy about his majesty's person. The duke was immediately arrested, and sent to the Tower, together with the lord Gray, and some other adherents: next day the dutchess was committed to the same place, as well as Sir Thomas Holdcrost, Sir Miles Partridge, Sir Michael Stanhope, Wingfield, Bannister, Vaughan, and many others. The duke of Somerset was soon brought to his trial before the marquis of Winchester, who sat as high steward upon the occa∣sion, and the rest of the peers, including the duke of Northumberland, the mar∣quis of Northampton, and the earl of Pembroke, who were both parties and judges in this court of judicature. He was accused of a design to secure the person of the king, and reassume the administration of affairs, to assassinate the duke of Northumberland, and raise an insurrection in the city of London. He pleaded Not guilty, and desired he might be confronted with his accusers. His request was rejected: he was acquitted of treason, but condemned to death for simple felony, on a statute passed in the reign of Henry VII. declaring it felonious for any person to harbour the thought of killing a privy counsellor. This scandalous sentence being pronounced, Somerset craved pardon of the duke of Northumberland, the marquis of Northampton, and the earl of Pem∣broke, for the enmity he had bore them. The populace seeing him reconveyed to the Tower without the ax, which was no longer carried before him, because he was condemned to be hanged, imagined he had been intirely acquitted; and in repeated shouts and acclamations manifested their joy, which was soon con∣verted into sorrow, when they were better informed of his doom.</P>

<P>The nation in general believed he would obtain his pardon; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing's heart was hardened against him by the arts of the minister, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho prevailed upon one Bartuille to declare to his majesty, that Somerset had employed him to assassinate the duke of Northumberland. He was even told, that the duke had confessed the whole scheme, after his condemnation: he was amused with diversions, that his mind might not have leisure to reflect upon the nature of the trial; he was besieged in such a manner, that no friend of his uncle could approach his person. That unhappy nobleman had indeed inter∣ested the lord Riche the chancellor in his favour; but the correspondence between them being accidentally discovered, the lord Riche was deprived of the great<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> seal, which was given in charge to the bishop of Ely. At length, the king signed an order for the execution of his uncle, who, on the twenty-second day o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> January appeared on the scaffold, without the least emotion, in the midst of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The people attested the truth of what he said by crying aloud, "It is most true:" and when he prayed, that the king might enjoy health and prosperity, there was a general response of Amen. The spectators seemed to be in great agitation, and on the brink of taking some violent measure. Certain people, who had been ordered to assist in arms at the execution, perceiving, as they approached Tower-hill, that the duke was already on the scaffold, mended their pace, crying aloud to each other, "Come "away<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>" the precipitation with which they advanced, and this exclama∣tion, which was ecchoed through the whole multitude, produced an universal tum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt. After this had subsided, Sir Anthony Brown riding towards the scas∣fold, the people exclaimed "A pardon, a pardon." But, the duke with great composure, assured them they were mistaken; and intreated them to be quiet, that he might pass his last moments in peace. Then he continued his speech; and concluding with a desire that they would join with him in prayer, submitted<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> to the stroke of the executioner. Thus fell the duke of Somerset, a sacrifice to the ambition of his rival. He was a nobleman of a middling genius, not without virtues, though warmed by strong passions, among which vanity, pride, and ambition, seemed to predominate. The people were so well convinced of his innocence, that they looked upon him as a martyr; and dipping handker∣chiefs in his blood, preserved them as precious relics. Sir Ralph Vane, a brave old soldier, and Sir Miles Partridge were hanged, and Sir Michael Stanhope, with Sir Thomas Arundel, beheaded as the duke's accomplices. Vaneencountered death with equal intrepidity and disdain, observing, that the time had been when he was of some estimation, but now the cowardly and courageous were treated alike; and all of them declared, in their last moments, that they had<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> never offended against the king, or any of his council.</P>

<P>While the English ministry was intent upon these transactions, the emperor's affairs in Germany assumed a new aspect. Maurice elector o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Saxony entered privately into a league with France, and the protestants of his own country. He sent ambassadors to engage Edward in the same association; and sollicit a supply of four hundred thousand crowns to maintain the interest
<PB N="681" REF="6930"/>
of the reformed religion. The ministry gave him to understand, that the king was not averse to a league calculated intirely for the sake of religion; but that he would not be concerned in any league or alliance which was concerted on political maxims. Nevertheless, if the elector of Saxony would confer more particularly with the protestant princes, and then send ambassadors sufficiently authorised to the king, he would return a more positive answer. The parlia∣ment assembling on the twenty-third of January, a statute was enacted against those who should write or speak evil of the king; but in this act was inserted a clause, importing, That no person should be convicted except upon the evi∣dence of two witnesses at least, to be confronted with the criminal. Then they passed an act to authorize the New common prayer-book; another for ascertaining the fasts and holidays; a third for the relief of the poor; a fourth allowing the marriage of the clergy; a fifth against usury; and a sixth against simony. A bill was brought into the house of peers, for setting aside the entail of Somerset's estate in favour of the children of his first marriage, whom he had excluded from his inheritance; but as a clause of this bill declared, that the late duke and his accomplices had been justly condemned, the house of commons refused to pass the act until the clause was removed. In the same session, the duke of Northumberland attempted to destroy Tonstall bishop of Durham by attainder, on pretence of having concealed a conspiracy against the king; but the commons rejected the bill, beeause the design was to con∣demn the bishop without his being confronted by his accusers. The duke's aim was to obtain for himself the dignity of palatine of Durham, which was an∣nexed to the bishopric. But perceiving, that this parliament, which had been elected during the protectorship of Somerset, was not disposed to comply with all his wishes, he took care that it should be dissolved, and another convoked for the ensuing year. In the mean time, he continued to indulge his resentment against the memory and adherents of the late duke of Somerset. He com∣menced a rigorous inquisition about the lands formerly belonging to the chan∣tries, which had been given away during the administration of that nobleman: and some of the new proprietors were condemned in heavy fines, while the rest appeased him with large sums of money. He conceived a violent antipathy to the lord Paget, who had been always a staunch adherent of Somerset; and that nobleman was not only subjected to a grievous fine, but even degraded from the order of the garter, on pretence that he was not a gentleman by birth. Thus, the duke at once gratified his resentment, and procured the vacant garter for his own son the lord Warwick. In the course of this year, Heath and Day, the bishops of Worcester and Chester, were deposed on acount of their open opposition to the reformed religion. The patents by which the king filled<NOTE PLACE="marg">His<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Reform.</NOTE> the vacant bishoprics, were altered in the form, so as that he was left at liberty to deprive them of their sees, according to his own pleasure, without observing the ordinary formalities. The company of German merchants known by the appellation of the Steel-yard, was suppressed because it monopolized the expor∣tation of the woollen manufacture; and a project was formed for converting Hull and Southampton into free ports; but, the scheme was never carried into execution. The king of France having declared war against the emperor, and taken Metz by surprize, the elector of Saxony assembled his troops, and pulling
<PB N="682" REF="6940"/>
off the mask, marched directly to Inspruck, where he had well nigh taken the emperor, who now found himself obliged to favour the protestants, by consenting to the famous edict of Passau.</P>

<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1553.</NOTE> The duke of Northumberland found the new parliament as ob∣sequious as he could have wished. They granted a very considerable subsidy to the king, on a supposition that his finances had been dissipated during the administration of Somerset. They suppressed the bishopric of Durham, in lieu of which one was founded in the same place, and another at Newcastle; but, the dignity of palatine was conferred on the duke of Northumberland. Then the parliament was dissolved, after a short session of one month; though, dur∣ing that time, the minister accomplished the purposes for which it had been convoked. The king, who had been for some time indisposed, in conse∣quence of the small pox, which le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a disorder upon his lungs, signed an order for the visitation of the churches, that their superfluous plate and o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aments might be converted to the use of the poor; but such fraud and ex∣tortion were practised in this inquiry, that the poor reaped very little benefit from the king's charitable intention. His distemper now degenerated into a confirmed consumption; and many people did not scruple to insinuate, that the duke of Northumberland had tampered with his constitution. Edward saw his own danger, and bore the prospect of death with uncommon fortitude: all the concern he manifested was for the state of religion, which he foresaw would be al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered in the reign of Mary his successor. He was greatly disturbed by this reflection; and the duke of Northumberland did not fail to feed his disquiet, by describing the scenes of persecution that would be acted under a popish sovereign. His design was to pave the way for Edward's setting aside the succession. When the physicians despaired of the king's life, he was com∣mitted to the care of an obscure woman, who undertook to cure him by means which she would not discover. No hopes of his recovery now remaining, the duke would no longer delay the marriage of his fourth son lord Guildford Dudley, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dy Jan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grey, eldest daughter of the new duke of Suffolk<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Frances Brandon, mentioned in Henry's will, as next in succession to his own daughters. At the same time, Jane's second sister Catherine espoused the lord Herbert eldest son of the earl of Pembroke; and the third was married to Martin Keys the groom-porter.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>These knots of interest being tied, the duke resolved to take the first opportunity of executing the other part of his project. One day, when the king lamented his sister's aversion to the reformed religion, Northumber∣land told him there was only way of preventing the misfortunes which threat∣ened his country; and that was by excluding the princess Mary from the suc∣cession, and transferring the crown to lady Jane Grey. He represented, that the princess Elizabeth could not help sharing her sister's fate, because the only pretence they could use against Mary was illegitimacy; and that equally affected Elizabeth, as the marriages of both their mothers had been declared unlawful by act of parliament. This expedient was well relished by Edward. The interest of religion was his prevailing care, which on this occasion sur∣mounted every other consideration; and he entertained the most tender regard for lady Jane Grey, who possessed all the amiable accomplishments of mind
<PB N="683" REF="6950"/>
and person. Three of the judges were forthwith ordered to draw up an act of conveyance, transferring the crown to lady Jane Grey upon the death of Ed∣ward. They at first refused to comply with this order, alledging, that in fram∣ing such an act, they should render themselves liable to the pains and penalties of high treason, according to act of parliament. The duke of Northumberland was so incensed at their refusal, that he could hardly refrain from personal vio∣lence. In a word, partly by threats, and partly by letters of pardon granted in their favour by anticipation, they were prevailed upon to draw up the act of conveyance, which was signed by all the other judges<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> except Sir James Hales<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and all the members of the privy council, C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anmer himself not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward.

<P>The king still continued under the regimen prescribed by the wo∣man who had undertaken his cure; but the distemper gaining ground every day<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she was dismissed, and the physicians were recalled. Notwithstanding all their endeavours, he died on the sixth day of July, in the seventeenth year of his age, and in the seventh year of his reign, after having exhibited marks of the most pious resignation. Edward is celebrated by historians for the beauty of his person, the sweetness of his disposition, and the extent of his knowledge. By that time he had attained his sixteenth year, he understood the Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and Spanish languages<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was versed inthe sciences of logic, music, natural philosophy, and master of all the theological disputes; insomuch that the famous Hieronymus Cardanus, in his return from Scotland, visiting the English court, was astonished at the progress he had made in learn∣ing; and afterwards extolled him in his works as a prodigy of nature.

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>THE duke of Northumberland carefully concealed the death of Ed∣ward, in hope of securing the person of the princess Mary, who by an order of council had been required to attend her brother in his illness. She had come as far as Hoddesdon, within seventeen miles of London, when she received a message from the earl of Arundel, informing her of Edward's death, and the steps which had been taken to exclude her from the throne. Alarmed at this intelligence, she retired immediately to Kenning-Hall in Norfolk, from whence she sent orders to Sir George Somerset, Sir William Drury, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir W. Waldegrave<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to attend her immediately with all the forces they could raise.
<PB N="685" REF="6970"/>
Circular letters were dispatched to all the great towns and nobility of the king∣dom, reminding them of her right, and commanding them to proclaim her without delay. Then she wrote to the council, expressing her surprize, that as they knew her undoubted right of succession, they had not made her acquainted with her brother's decease; and promising to take them into favour, provided they would immediately proclaim her in the city of London, and other places, ac∣cording to the dictates of their duty. Having taken these steps, she retired to Framlingham-Castle in Suffolk, that she might be near the sea, and escape to Flanders, in case she should find herself hard pressed. Mean while the duke of Northumberland, who governed the kingdom in the name of the council, being apprised of Mary's retreat, went with the duke of Suffolk as deputies from the council, to intimate to Jane Grey her accession to the throne by vir∣tue of an act of conveyance. They found this young lady at Sion-house; and when they made her acquainted with the design of their visit, she was over∣whelmed with grief and astonishment. She shed a flood of tears, appeared quite inconsolable; and it was not without the utmost reluctance, that she yielded to the intreaties of Northumberland, Northampton, her own sather and husband, so far as to accept the crown. At length, however, they extorted her consent; and next day conveyed her to the Tower. On the tenth day of July she was pro∣claimed in London; and the council sent an answer to Mary's letter, importing, That as she was born of an unlawful marriage, formally dissolved by act of par∣liament, she ought to drop her pretensions, and acknowledge the sovereignty of queen Jane, who had ascended the throne by virtue of the late king's letters∣patent.</P>

<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>The people were so astonished when they heard this lady proclaimed, that they expressed no marks of joy and exultation. They could not con∣ceive for what reason king Henry's two daughters were excluded from the succession; and they hated the duke of Northumberland, as the person who had ruined their darling Somers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Nor was their hatred alleviated by the conduct of the duke on this occasion. A low plebeian having uttered some sarcastic observation upon this unexpected succession, he ordered him to be ap∣prehended, deprived of his ears, and exposed in the pillory for his insolence; an act of severity, from which the populace drew an ill omen of the new go∣vernment. The duke knew he had incurred the odium of the people, and even of the great. He suspected some members of the council of aversion to his person and measures; and for that reason continued to keep them in the Tower, on pretence of conforming to the practice of the English sovereigns, who, with their council, used to reside in the Tower, on their first accession to the throne. His suspicions were not without foundation. The earl of Arundel was attached to the old religion, and hated Northumberland, who had extorted from him a large fine, on pretence that he had dissipated the king's revenues. The other members were disgusted by his insupportable pride and arrogance; and longed for an opportunity to shake off the yoke of his authority. At present they found themselves in effect prisoners; and were fain to temporize, by assenting to every thing he proposed. The death of Edward, and accession of lady Jane Grey<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were notified to the English ambassadors at foreign courts; and Richard Shelly was dispatched as envoy, with a letter from Jane to the emperor, offering to re∣new the treaty of peace between him and England. Shelly, however, did not

Ne∣vertheless, the earl of Arundel, who wanted nothing but an opportunity to act openly in behalf of Mary, made such remonstrances to Jane Grey, touching the military character of the duke of Northumberland, which would strike terror into the hearts of her enemies, that she insisted upon his taking the command of the forces in lieu of her father, from whom she could not part without the utmost re∣luctance. Northumberland could not help complying with her request. He set out for the army at Newmarket, attended by his son the earl of Warwick<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tho marquis of Northampton, the earl of Huntingdon, and the lord Grey of Wil∣ton; and soon found himself at the head of eight thousand men, with whom he advanced to Bury. Mean while, Mary was joined by the lord Thomas Howard son to the duke of Norfolk, with all the friends of that family. Six ships being ordered by the council to cruise on the coast of Suffolk, in order to prevent her escape by sea, were driven by stress of weather into a port of Essex, where the crews imprisoned their commanders, and revolted to Mary. Four thousand men were raised in her behalf in Bucks, by Sir Edward Hastings, the lord Windsor, and Sir Edward Peckham: another body had assembled in Oxfordshire, under Sir John Williams; and a third in the county of Nor∣thampton, commanded by Sir Thomas Tresham. Nevertheless, when her<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>.</NOTE> friends were informed that the duke of Northumberland had begun his march, some of them advised her to retire into another country; and perhaps she would<NOTE PLACE="marg">B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> have complied with this advice, had he acted with vigour and dispatch. But, in all probability, he perceived marks of disaffection among his troops. Instead of marching directly to the enemy, he loitered several days in the neighbour∣hood of Cambridge; and ordered doctor Edwin Sandys vice-chancellor of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>en.</NOTE> university, to support the succession of Jane in a sermon. The doctor preached accordingly, but spoke with such circumspection, that he offended neither party. This was not the case with Ridley at London, who preached with more zeal than discretion; and made so free with the character of Mary, that she never forgave him for the attack.</P>

<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>The duke wrote to the council in the most pressing terms for a rein∣forcement; and they ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ually offered eight crowns per month, besides subsistence, to every volunteer who would inli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in the service: but, such was the general odium against Northumberland, that few or none would engage even on these terms; while they crowded to the banners of Mary, and maintained themselves at their own expence. In a little time her army amounted to forty thousand men, and great numbers of people assisted her with money, plate, and jewels. Their regard for the heir of blood concurred with their detestation of Northum∣berland,
<PB N="687" REF="6990"/>
to produce a torrent of popularity in her favour. The earls of Arundel and Pembroke, finding themselves still detained in the Tower under the inspection of the duke of Suffolk, who was instructed by Northumberland to watch their con∣duct, took an opportunity from that duke's pressing letters to propose, that as the French ambassador was averse to enter the Tower, they should meet him at Bay∣nard's-Castle, a house belonging to the earl of Pembroke, where they might confer with him, and take measures for bringing over a body of troops which had been raised by the direction of the duke, for the service of queen Jane. Suffolk as∣senting to the proposal, they invited to the place all the noblemen about Lon∣don who were thought well affected to Mary; and when they met, the earl of Arundel made a speech in favour of that princess, proposing that she might be proclaimed queen of England. This motion being seconded by the earl of Pembroke, who laid his hand upon his sword, and declared he would defend her against all opponents, the whole assembly assented to the proposal. They forthwith sent for the lord mayor and aldermen, and informed them of the reso∣lution which had been taken: then mounting their horses, they rode to the cross in Cheapside, where Mary was proclaimed queen of England, by Sir Christopher Barker principal king at arms: Te Deum was sung in the cathe∣dral at St, Paul's; and the event was celebrated with all manner of rejoicings usual on such occasions. The earl of Arundel and lord Paget were dispatched to Framlingham-Castle, to give the queen an account of these proceedings. Some companies took possession of the Tower without opposition. Lady Jane Grey resigned her royalty with marks of real satisfaction; and retired with her mother to their own habitation.</P>

<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Suffolk acquie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced in all these transactions; and next day that nobleman, with archbishop Cranmer, chancellor Goodricke, the marquis of Winchester, and the rest of the council, signed an order to the duke of Nor∣thumberland, to disband his forces, and behave him<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf like a dutiful subject to queen Mary. He had already been informed of this sudden revolution; and dismissed the remainder of his army, which had been greatly reduced by desertion. His first intention was to quit the kingdom immediately, but being prevented by the band of pensioners, who told him, he must stay to justify their conduct, he endeavoured to recommend himself to Mary by extravagant de∣monstrations of zeal for her service. He repaired to the market-place in Cam∣bridge, and proclaiming her queen of England, threw up his cap in token of joy. But, he reaped no advantage from these exterior marks of attachment. Next day, he was arrested in the queen's name by the earl of Arundel, at whose feet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e fell down upon his knees, begging his protection in the most abject terms of supplication. His three sons, the lord Warwick, Ambrose, and Hen∣ry, his brother Sir Andrew Dudley, Sir John, and Sir Henry Gates, Sir Tho∣mas Palmer, and doctor Sandys, shared the same fate; and were committed to the Tower of London. It was on this occasion that a woman, approaching the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambass. de Noailles.</NOTE> duke in his way to prison, presented an handkerchief which she had dipped in the blood of the duke of Somerset; and upbraided him with the ruin of that innocent nobleman. About the same time, the earl of Huntingdon, the mar∣quis of Northampton, the lords Hastings, and Robert Dudley, Sir Robert Corbet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and bishop Ridley, were likewise taken into custody: as were the duke

<P>On the third day of April the queen made her entry into London, ac∣companied by her sister Elizabeth, who had joined her on the road with a thou∣sand horse raised for her service. When she arrived at the Tower she released the duke of Norfolk, the dutchess of Somerset, the bishops Gardiner and Bonner, and the lord Edward Courtenay, son and heir of the marquis of Exeter, a young nobleman, whom, in a few days she created earl of Devonshire. Thus Mary became mistress of the realm without bloodshed; though she owed her success, in a great measure, to the popular hatred which the duke of Nor∣thumberland had incurred: but she forgot the good offices of the Suffolk peo∣ple<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who had first declared in her favour, on the express promise of being in∣du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged with liberty of conscience. She was indeed a bigot to her religion in the most gloomy sense; and her attention, during her whole reign, was en∣grossed by the eager desire of restoring the papal power in England, and of gratifying her revenge against those who were aver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to her principles and suc∣cession. She proposed in council to re-establish the catholic religion at once, and send for cardinal Pole, in quality of pope's legate. Gardiner dreaded the effects of such a sudden change, and foresaw that cardinal Pole, who was not his friend, would soon supersede his influence with the queen. He therefore privately sent an express to the emperor, representing that the queen's proposal was dangerous, because the English people could not be brought all at once to recognize the papal authority, and the zeal of the cardinal would produce dangerous convulsions in the kingdom: that, on the contrary, every thing would succeed to the satisfacti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of her majesty and the advantage of religion, provided she, the queen, would appoint him chancellor, that he might be vested with authority sufficient to manage such a delicate affair, and execute the scheme which he had projected. Charles was so convinced of the solidity of his remonstrance, that he wrote to Mary, exhorting her to moderate her zeal, and listen to the advice of Gardiner, to whom she at length committed the great seal of England, even before his pardon was expedited: so that he sat as judge in chancery, while he himself was under sentence of death.</P>

<P>On the eighteenth day of August, the duke of Northumberland was brought to his trial in Westminster-hall, Thomas duke of Norfolk, sitting as high steward. He desired to know, whether a man, acting by orders under the g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tat seal, could be justly charged with treason for these actions? and, whether those, who were at least equally culpable, could sit as his judges? The high steward replied, That the great seal of an usurper could be no warrant; and, that any person, against whom there was nothing upon record, was reputed, in law, capable of sitting on any trial. From this last answer, which is so repugnant to common sense, the duke foresaw that any objection he could make would be over∣ruled; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e therefore confessed the indictment, and referred himself to her majesty's mercy. His example, in this particular, was followed by the earl of Warwick and the marquis of Northampton, who were tried at the same tribunal; and all three were condemned to death as traitors. Sir John and Sir Henry Gates, Sir<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> Andrew Dudley, and Sir Thomas Palmer, pleaded guilty, and underwent the same sentence. The duke consessed on the scaff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, that he had been always a

Roman catholic in his heart, and expressed great sorrow for having plundered the effects of the church, especially as he could not now make restitution. He is said to have been amused with a promise of pardon, in consequence of which he made this confession: if that was the case he was miserably deceived, and died unregretted by both parties; Gates and the infamous Palmer suffered death, but the other condemned persons were first reprieved, and afterwards pardoned. When the obsequies of Edward were performed in Westminster-abbey, the new ministers proposed to use the old office, which had been abolished; but Cranmer opposed this design with great vehemence, and, in person, eelebrated the service according to the new liturgy.</P>

<P>Though the queen declared in council, that she would not force the consciences of her subjects, she favoured the Roman catholics so openly, that they did not scruple to say in public, their religion would soon be re∣established. Bonner's chaplain, Bourn, preaching in St. Paul's church, ex∣tolled his master with such extravagant encomiums, and mentioned king Ed∣ward in such contemptuous terms, that his audience, being incensed at his inso∣lence, began to pelt him with stones, and handled him so roughly that he would have lost his life, had not he been protected by Bradford and Rogers, two protestant ministers. The queen afterwards published a proclamation, professing the faith in which she had been educated; but promised that no person should be punished for religion, until it should be established by act of parliament. In the mean time she forbad all unlawful assemblies, and all persons were prohibited from preaching without licences. She declared that no man should be punished for the last rebellion without her own express order; but that she would punish severely all those who should promote such pernicious designs for the future. The inhabitants of Suffolk, trusting to the verbal promise of her majesty, did not scrupulously observe the injunctions in this proclamation; and, an order being sent to their magistrates to punish the delinquents with the utmost rigour of the law, they sent deputies to court, to remind the queen of her promise: but their remonstrance was treated with great contempt, and one of their deputies placed in the pillory for the freedom of his expostulation. Bradford and Rogers were consined on account of their popularity. Bonner, Gardiner, Tonstal, Heath, and Day, were re-established in the dioceses of which they had been deprived. Hooper, bishop of Glou∣cester, and Coverdale of Exeter, with several other protestant divines, were imprisoned, because they would not submit to Gardiner, who was impowered by the queen to grant licences for preaching. Divine service was openly cele∣brated in the old manner, though contrary to the laws still subsisting. Judge Hales was fined in a thousand pounds for having directed the judges of Kent to con∣form to the laws of Edward, which had not been repealed. Montague was dismissed from his office, which was bestowed on Bromley, a papist. Peter Martyr, professor of theology at Oxford, underwent such insults from the enemies of the reformation, that he was obliged to take shelter in Cranmer's house; though that prelate was in no condition to protect himself, for the court had already doomed him to destruction.</P>

<P>Bonner not only endeavoured by coarse raillery to ridicule the good bishop, whom he called Mr. Canterbury; but, in order to scandalize the arch∣bishop's character, diffused a report that he had submitted to the queen, and
<PB N="690" REF="7020"/>
promised to make a public re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntation of his errors. Cranmer, in order to vindi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te himself from this a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on, drew up a declaration of his faith, which he offered to maintain in public, with the queen's permission. On account of this writing, which was published without his knowledge, he was summoned to the Star-chamber, where he owned himself the author of the paper; and was<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for that day, dismissed. Some of the council advised the queen to treat <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gently, as he had always been remarkable for the mildness of his disposition. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spoke in his favour, because he knew that the archbishopric would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e given to cardinal Pole, should the see be vacated. The queen herself, for∣getting that Cranmer had interposed in her behalf, when her father intended to have sacrificed her to his resentment, resolved to r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in him effectually. She remembered nothing of Cranmer, but that he had pronounced her mother's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and promoted the reformation.

Several other preachers were imprisoned at the same time: Peter Martyr, John Lasco, and all the foreign protestants, who had taken refuge in England, were allowed to quit the kingdom in peace; a good number of the English, who professed the reformed religion, foreseeing a persecution, withdrew into foreign coun∣tries on pretence of being natives of France, until orders were sent to all the sea-ports, that no person should be allowed to leave the kingdom on that pre∣tence, without producing a passport, signed by the French ambassador.</P>

<P>The queen now resolved to recompence those noblemen who had exerted themselves vigorously in her favour. The earl of Arundel was appointed lord steward of the household, Sir Edward Hastings was made master of the horse, and afterwards a peer of the realm. The earl of Sussex was created a knight of the garter, with the particular privilege of appearing covered in the queen's presence. Lord Paget was re-admitted into that order; Francis ear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Shrewsbury was appointed president of the north; Sir John Williams promoted to a peerage, and afterwards to the office of chamberlain to the household; Sir Henry Jernegan was constituted captain of her guard, which was increased with the addition of four hundred men; and Sir Thomas Tresham was created lord Prior of the order of St. John of Jerusalem, which was now revived; conse∣quently he took rank as the first baron of England. Thomas lord Delaware,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> Sir William Drury, and Sir Richard Southwell, were gratified with pensions. The queen promoted her chaplain Hopton to the see of Norwich, appointed Englefield master of the wards, Rochester comptroller of the household, and Waldgrave master of the wardrobe. On the first day of October Mary was crowned by the hands of Gardiner bishop of Winchester; and she that same day published an amnesty, from the benefit of which, however, all those who had been arrested before the month of September, and many others, were no∣minally excluded. Then Mary, with a view to ingratiate herself with her sub∣jects, and dispose the people to return members of parliament who should act agreeably to her intention, remitted the subsidies which had been granted for the payment of Edward's debts: but, immediately after this popular act, she re-established John Wesey in the see of Exeter, which he had resigned in the

<P>The next care of the ministry was to pack a parliament that should be favourable to their designs; and such scandalous methods were taken for this purpose, that although the protestants were much more numerous than the papists in England, almost all the members of the house of commons were roman catholics; in the house of lords the queen had a great majority; for even the greatest part of those noblemen, who had professed the reformed re∣ligion in the reign of Edward, now infamously conformed to the court-doc∣trines, from motives of interest and ambition. All the protestant bishops were either imprisoned or deposed, except Taylor of Lincoln, and Harley of Here∣ford; and these were expelled from the house of peers on the first day of the session, because they refused to kneel at the mass. The only statutes enacted in this short session, were, an act to limit all treasons to the cases specified in a former statute on the same subject in the reign of Edward the Third; and another, to repeal the act of attainder passed against the marchioness of Exeter, whose son, the earl of Devonshire, was now re-established in all the honours of his family. The two houses, meeting again on the twenty-fourth of October, after a very short prorogation, passed an act for reversing the sentence of di∣vorce between Henry VIII. and Catherine of Arragon, and for repealing all the acts by which that sentence had been confirmed. By this law the princess Elizabeth was again declared illegitimate; and Mary, having no further occasion for her concurrence, treated her with harshness and even cruelty. Before the meeting of the parliament she had, by dint of importunity, prevailed upon Elizabeth to accompany her to mass, that the people might think she did no∣thing without the concurrence of the presumptive heir; but now that she was rendered incapable of succeeding the queen, she withdrew from her all marks of affection or regard. An act was passed for abolishing all the laws which Ed∣ward had made touching religion; and all form of public worship was prohi∣bited, except that which had been used at the end of Henry's reign. Another statute decreed rigorous penalties against those who should maltreat ecclesiastics on the score of the re-established service, or profane the Eucharist, or pull down crosses, crucifixes, and images. Then the parliament renewed an act of the last reign, making it fel#ny for twelve people, or any greater number, to assemble with a view of changing the established religion; and repealed the act of attainder, which had passed against the duke of Norfolk.</P>

<P>On the third day of November, the lady Jane Grey, her husband lord Guildford Dudley, his two brothers, and archbishop Cranmer, were brought to trial; and, confessing their indictments, were condemned to death for levying war against the queen, and conspiring in favour of an usurper. Yet the see of Canterbury was not declared void, because Mary intended that Cranmer should be deposed in a canonical manner; and, to make a merit of pardoning his treason against herself, while she resolved that he should suffer death as an heretic. Mean while the revenues of the archbishopric were se∣questred; and the prelate, with the other convicts, sent back to the Tower. Upon the death of Edward, cardinal Brandini, the pope's legate at Brussels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> had sent over an agent, whose name was Commendoni, to sound the inclinations of Mary; who told him that her intention was to re-establish the papal autho∣rity
<PB N="692" REF="7040"/>
in England, and desired that his holiness would send over cardinal Pole as his legate. At the same time she exhorted Commendoni to continue the dis∣gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e in which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had come to England, that her designs might not be too <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> divulged. The pope, being made acquainted with her desire, advised with his consistory, which declared that it would not be for the honour of the holy see to send over a legate until one should be demanded in form; but the pope, giving them to understand that he knew more than he thought p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oper to disclose on that subject, they assented to the proposal.</P>

<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The nomination of Pole to this office was equally disagreeable to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>peror and bishop Gardiner. Charles had projected a match between his son Philip and Mary, and was apprehensive of the scheme's miscarrying by the i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rposition of Pole, whom, it was reported, the queen intended to take for her husband: Gardiner, on the other hand, foresaw that this legate would step between him and the archbishopric of Canterbury; and, in all probability, de∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y his influence at court. He therefore represented to the queen, that Pole would r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in her in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entions in favour of the roman catholic religion, by his un∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>onable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal. The emperor wrote to her on the same subject in the most earnest manner, and proposed the marriage between her and his son Philip prince of Spain, of which she perceived all the advantage, and accordingly embraced the proposal. She likewise wrote to Pole, who had been detained in his journey to England by the emperor's order, that the interest of religion would not per∣mit him to come over immediately to England, where the people were not yet properly disposed to recognize the pope's authority: nevertheless, she carried on a litera<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y correspondence with the cardinal, who advised her to reconcile her kingdom at once to the holy see, without regarding the murmurs of the peo∣ple. Gardiner <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>renuously opposed this council, alledging that the marriage ought to be concluded before a total re-union with the Roman see, because in that case her measures would be supported by a powerful alliance. Gardiner despised Pole as a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>llow politician, and the cardinal looked him upon as a man of intrigue, who made religion subservient to his own interest: in a word, they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed one another. The commons, being informed of the intended match, sent the speaker, with a deputation of twenty members, to supplicate the queen that she would not give her hand to any foreign prince; and she, per∣ceiving she had nothing to expect from them, unless she would give them satis∣faction in this particular, immediately dissolved the parliament. During the session of parliament, the convocation, fitting as usual, re-established the doc∣trine of transubstantiation, which was opposed by six deputies only, and three of these maintained a public dispute against the real presence in the Eucharist; but they were reviled, threatened, insulted, and interrupted in their arguments; and the victory was of course adjudged to their adversaries: for, by this time, one hundred and sixty benefices had been bestowed upon the creatures of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> court; so that there were very few protestants in the lower house of con∣vocation.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This prelate had already received twelve hundred thousand crowns from Charles, to render certain individuals propitious to the match; and now he affected to

insist upon conditions that should be very advantageous to England. The treaty was concluded on these terms: That, by virtue of the marriage, Philip should enjoy the title of king of England conjunctly with Mary, as long as the mar∣riage should subsist; but that the queen should di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the revenues of Eng∣land, and the nomination of all employments and benefi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, which should be conferred upon the natives of England only: That she should enjoy the titles belonging to the king her husband: That her jointure should be sixty thou∣sand livres: That the children of the marriage should succeed to the effects of the mother: That the archduke Charles, the son of Philip, should enjoy the kingdom of Spain, Naples, and Sicily, with the dutchy of Milan and all the Italian dominions; but, in default of prince Charles and his issue, these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove∣reignties should devolve to the eldest born of Philip and Mary: That this first∣born should, at any rate, have Burgundy and the Low Countries: That the younger sons and daughters of the marriage should be provided with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nages and portions in England: That, in case the marriage should produce daugh∣ters only, the eldest should succeed to Burgundy and the Low Countries, pro∣vided she should, with the consent of her brother Charles, espous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a native of these countries or one of her mother's dominions; otherwise prince Charles should keep possession of these countries, and provide her with a portion as∣signed upon Spain and the Low Countries: That, if prince Charles should die without issue, the eldest son of Philip and Mary, or, in default of sons, the eldest daughter should succeed to all the dominions of her father and mother; and, that the successor should not intrench upon the laws, customs, and privileges of the countries composing his or her inheritance, nor administer the govern∣ment by any other than natives of the respective countries. There was a clause annexed, importing, That, before the consummation of the marriage, Philip should solemnly swear to the observation of the following articles: That all his domestics should be English or subjects of the queen: That he should bring no foreigner into England, who might be disagreeable to the natives of this country: That he should make no change in the laws, statutes, and customs of England: That he should not convey the queen from her dominions, with∣out her own express desire; nor any of the children, without the consent of the nobility: That, in case of his surviving the queen without issue by her, he should not arrogate to himself any right upon England or its dependencies; but leave the succession to the lawful heir: That he should not carry jewels or other things of value out of the kingdom; nor alienate any thing belonging to the crown, nor suffer any sort of usurpation; and that, notwithstanding this marriage, the alliance between England and France should remain un∣infringed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>Immediately after the ratification of this treaty, which brought no advantage to England, though it strengthened the hands of a popish ministry, the queen pardoned the marquis of Northampton, who had been condemned with the duke of Northumberland; and suspended the effect of the acts of par∣liament which had been made to the disadvantage of the monopolizing company of German merchants.

The whole nation was filled with murmurs and dis∣content, which at length degenerated into a conspiracy: at least the Spanish
<PB N="694" REF="7060"/>
match was the pretence for countenancing a rebellion contrived by the duke of Suffolk, Sir Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Carew of Devonshi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and Sir Thomas Wyat of Kent, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their intention was cert<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inly to depose Mary, and restore the lady Jane Grey to the throne of England.

He assembled a small number of people, and proclaimed at Maidstone, that his intention was to prevent the kingdom from being en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laved by the Spaniards. Then he repaired to Rochester, and fortified the bridge with some pieces of cannon. The queen, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>armed at this revolt, which she was in no condition to suppress, as she had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her army, sent an herald with offers of pardon to the rebels, if they would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay down their arms and submit. This offer being rejected, she ordered <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e duke of Norfolk to march against them at the head of her guards, reinforced by five hundred Londoners, commanded by one Bret; and, in the mean time, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eriff of Kent, raising a posse, encountered one Knevet, in his mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to join Wyat, and routed him at the first onset. Sir George Harper, one of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yat's parti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans, feigning to defert to the duke of Norfolk, persuaded Bret with his Londoners to join the rebels; and their example was followed by the majority of the guards: so that Norfolk, Arundel, and Jernegan, betook them∣selves to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ight, while their baggage and artillery fell into the hands of the enemy.</P>

<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>Wyat, thus reinforced to the number of four thousand men, began his march for London. Being met at Deptford by two deputies whom the queen had sent to know his intention, he demanded for himself the government of the Tower and the guard of the queen's person, and in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isted upon the coun∣cil's being changed at his discretion. These extravagant demands the queen in person reported to the citizens of London assembled in Guildhall, desiring their a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>istance against the traitor; and declaring she would take up her habi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion within the city, to manifest the confidence she reposed in their loyalty and affection. Mean while she armed a body of five hundred men, chiefly foreigners, for the defence of the bridge. Wyat, on the third day of Febru∣ary, arrived in Southwark: but, finding the bridge secured against him, he marched along the river Thames to Kingston; and, though the bridge at that place was cut down, and the oppo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite bank guarded by a small number of men, he repaired the breach, and passed with his army, by this time increased to six thousand. Then he proceeded directly to London; and, on the fifth day of the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th in the morning, reached Hyde-park, where he was deserted by many of his followers, and, among the rest, by Sir George Harper; who, in order to make some amends for his treason, disclosed the whole scheme to her majesty. Wyat, leaving his artillery and the greatest part of his followers in Hyde-park, advanced at the head of the rest into Westminster, repulsed Sir John Gage with the guards at Charing-cross; and, continuing his march thro' the Strand and Fleet-street, found Ludgate strongly barricaded and well guarded against his entrance. Being refused admittance he wheeled about, in order to retire; but, by this time, the earl of Pembroke had assembled a good number of horse and foot, and, by means of chains and barricadoes, inter∣cepted his retreat. Then his courage began to fail him. Clarencieux the

herald coming with a message from the queen, and exhorting him to deserve her clemency by submission, he surrendered himself to Sir Maurice Berkeley, and all his followers laid down their arms.</P>

<DIV4 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Suffolk had retired to Warwickshire, where he was discovered to have had a share in this conspiracy, by an intercepted letter from Wyat; and the earl of Huntingdon received an order to arrest him. The duke being informed of this circumstance, dismissed his followers, and con∣cealed himself at the house of one Underwood, his own ranger, who basely be∣trayed him to the earl, by whom he was conveyed to the Tower of London. This conspiracy proved fatal to lady Jane Grey, to whom Dr. Feck<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m, dean of St. Paul's, was sent with a message from the queen, desiring that she and her husband should prepare for immediate death. She received this notice with marks of real joy; and, when Fecknam exhorted her to embrace the catholic religion, she told him she had no time to enter into religious controversies. He, mistaking her meaning, prevailed upon the queen to reprieve her for three days longer; but, when she was informed of this respite, she assured him it was f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from being agreeable to her wishes. Then he disputed with her on dif∣ferent points of doctrine, concerning which she argued with uncommon strength of reason, displaying a surprising fund of knowledge. Her husband had ob∣tained leave to take his last forewell of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, but she would not consent to such an interview, left it should shake their mutual fortitude: she, nevertheless, viewed him through the window as he went to execution, and even saw his headless body brought back in a cart, to be interred in the Tower chapel. She herself, in two hours after his execution, suffered on a scaffold within the for∣tress, left her fate should excite dangerous commotions among the populace. The lieutenant of the Tower bogging she would favour him with some me∣morial, she presented him with tablets, in which she had written three short sentences in the Greek and Latin languages, declaring her own innocence. In her way to the scaffold she faluted the spectators with equal affbility and com∣posure, holding Fecknam by the hand. When she reached the scene of her suffering, she embraced him affectionately, saying, <Q>“God will require you, good Sir, for your humanity to me: though it gave me more uneasiness than all the terrors of approaching death.”</Q> Then turning to the spectators, she observed that innocence was no excuse for facts that tended to the prejudi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the public. Having spent a little time in devotion, her female attendants took off her gown and the ornaments of her head and neck, and covered her eyes with an handkerchief. Thus prepared, she laid her head on the block, and encouraged the executioner, who hesitated to do his office; which at length he performed: her fate drawing tears from the eyes of all the spectators, even those who were zealously attached to queen Mary. Her death was followed by the execution of Wyat's accomplices. Twenty gibbets were erected in different parts of the city, and on these fifty rebels were hanged.</P>

<P>Alexander Bret, with several persons of distinction, suffered the same face in Kent; four hundred appeared before the queen with halters about their necks, and were pardoned. The duke of Suffolk received sentence of death on the seventeenth day of February, and was beheaded. Wyat, being tampered with by some of the court emissaries, accused the marquis of Exeter of having a share in the conspiracy. Mary is said to have looked upon this

nobleman through the medium of jealousy, because he seemed to neglect her advances, and preferred his addresses to the princess Elizabeth. Being accused by Wyat, he was committed to the Tower, and Elizabeth sent thither as his accomplice. But Wyat, being touched with remorse, in his way to execution, begged leave to see the marquis, and on his knees implored his forgiveness for<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> having loaded him with so foul a calumny. He likewise, in presence of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>riffs and all the spectators, exculpated Elizabeth, whose life was violently pursued by Gardiner bishop of Winchester. On the twenty-seventh day of April lord Thomas Grey was beheaded, as an abettor of his brother the duke of Suffolk.

The first act of the session imported, That the prerogative royal was attached to the person who enjoyed the crown, whether male or female; and consequently that the queen possessed all the rights of her progenitors, according to the constitution of England. The in∣tention of this act, planned by Gardiner, was to hinder Philip from taking possession of the administration, and rendering himself absolute in England. A scheme of government had been projected, for absolving Mary of all restric∣tions, on the ridiculous pretence, that all the laws enacted for limiting the prerogative, had alluded to kings only; and that she, being a queen, was not bound by such restraints. This projector had been encouraged by the empe∣ror's ambassador; and, at the same time, the Spaniards affected to publish a genealogy of Philip, deducing him in a direct line from John of Ghent, duke of Lancaster; as if he had intended to avail himself of that title in his efforts to enslave the English nation. The parliament re-established the bishopric of Durham, which had been suppressed in the late reign; it confirmed the sen∣tence against the duke of Suffolk and those who had been lately executed, and approved the treaty of marriage between the queen and Philip. Towards the end of the session a new conference was appointed at Oxford, on the subject of transubstantiation. As the protestants complained of the manner in which the last dispute on that subject had been carried on, the court ordered it to be re∣commenced at Oxford; and Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, were sent thither from the Tower, as the protestant champions. In the course of their argu∣mentation they were insulted, interrupted, and silenced. On the supposition of their being confuted, they were summoned to abjure their errors, and, on their refusal excommunicated.</P>

<P>On the twentieth day of July prince Philip arrived at Southampton, with a fleet of sixty ships. When he set foot on English ground he unsheathed his sword<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and, being presented with the keys of the town by the magistrates, he restored them, without speaking one word. The queen met him at Win∣chester, where they were married by Gardiner, and their nuptials solemnized with great state and magnificence. Philip was in the twenty-seventh year of his age, and Mary turned of eight and thirty. After the ceremony of the mar∣riage they were proclaimed king and queen of England, France, Naples, and Jerusalem, with the addition of many other high sounding titles. He was a prince of the most profound dissimulation, and maintained a reserve which was extremely disgusting to the English people: nevertheless, he brought over great sums of money, which reconciled many persons to the marriage. From Win∣chester they removed to Windsor, where Philip was installed a knight of the garter. In order to conciliate the affection of his new subjects, he interceded in behalf of the princess Elizabeth and some others whom Gardiner had devoted to destruction. By his mediation Elizabeth, the archbishop of York, and ten knights were pardoned. Notwithstanding this generosity, he was very disagree∣able to the nation: no person could approach him or the queen without having first demanded and obtained an audience; so that her court was almost wholly deserted. The duke of Norfolk died in September; and the lord Paget, with another nobleman, was sent over to the Low Countries to conduct cardinal Pole into England, as the pope's legate.</P>

<P>Mean while the parliament meeting on the eleventh day of No∣vember, repealed the act by which that prelate had been condemned in the reign of the last Henry. He was received in England with extraordinary marks of joy by the king, queen, and nobility. The parliament being summoned to attend their majesties in the house of lords, the cardinal declared the subject of his legation, which was to bring them back, like so many strayed sheep, into the fold of Christ. He spoke so pathetically on this occasion, that the queen was transported with an excess of pleasure, and declared she felt the child leap in her womb. This declaration was immediately published through the whole kingdom; and Te Deum was sung in St. Paul's church with great solemnity. Her female attendants encouraged her in the conceit of her own pregnancy till the middle of next year, when she was effectually undeceived, to her un∣speakable mortification. On the twenty-ninth day of November the two<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward.

This request being communicated to the legate, he repaired to the house of peers; and, af∣ter having expatiated upon the pope's tender affection for the people of Eng∣land, prescribed, by way of penance, that they should abolish all the laws enacted against the papal authority. Then he indulged both houses with ab∣solution, which they received on their knees, and removed all ecclesiastical censures. They accordingly enacted a statute, re-establishing the pope's au∣thority in England, under certain limitations, however, one of which was an express clause, That alienations of church-lands should be authorized; and that

<P>Gardiner had now almost attained the accomplishment of his wishes. He sat as judge in the high court of chancery; he acted as prime minister, and chief counsellor to the queen; from thence he thought his glory would be com∣pieted<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></NOTE> by compelling the protestants to recognize the papal authority. He began the persecution with Hooper, who had been bishop of Gloucester, and Rogers, one of the most popular protestant preachers. They were condemned for heresy by the chancellor, and other commissioners appointed to judge these matters; and being delivered over to the secular arm, Rogers was burned in Smithfield, where he suffered with great constancy, rather than enjoy an offered pardon at the expence of changing his religion. Hooper was sent to Gloucester; and, after having <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>jected a pardon on the same terms, was brought to the stake: there he suffered inexpressible torment by being burned piecemeal, insomuch that one of his arms dropped off before he expired; yet he bore his fate with surprising patience and resignation. The next victim was a preacher called Sanders, who suffered death at Coventry; and he was soon followed by doctor Taylor, vicar of Hadley, an old reverend ecclesiastic, who ventured to oppose some Romish priests, who celebrated mass in his church. Gardiner being informed of his behaviour, sent for him to London, where he reviled him with the epithets
<PB N="699" REF="7110"/>
of traitor, villain, heretic, and knave, committed him to the prison of the King's-bench, from which, in a few days, he was brought to his trial, con∣demned, and sent down to be burned at Hadley. When he was conducted to the stake, and began to harangue the by-standers, one of the guards struck him on the head. Then he was fixed in a barrel of pitch, and one of the spectators flinging a faggot at the good old man, which wounded him severely, so that his whole visage was covered with blood, he replied, <Q>“Oh friend! I have harm enough, what needed that?”</Q> When he repeated a psalm in English, one of the guards struck him on the mouth, bidding him speak Latin; and while he was employed in pious ejaculations, another cleft his head with an halbert in such a manner, that his brains came out, and he expired. Perhaps history cannot parallel a more infamous scene of unprovoked cruelty. Bradley was con∣demned at the same time, but Gardiner thought proper to delay his exe∣cution.</P>

<P>Perceiving that the execution of these four ecclesiastics served only to increase the zeal of the protestants, and excite murmurings among the people, he transferred to Bonner a commission, from which he had nothing to expect but the hatred of the public; and in so doing, he let loose the most sa∣vage minister of vengeance upon the protestants; for the zeal of Gardiner was cruel, but that of Bonner altogether furious. Every person of humanity, what∣ever might be his persuasion in points of religion, was shocked at this bar∣barity; even the bishops were ashamed of it, and on all occasions publicly dis∣claimed the persecution: so that the odium of course fell upon the king and queen, particularly on the former, who was a foreigner, and had been educated in a country subject to the inquisition. Philip being informed of this calumny<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and opinion of the English, justified himself by the mouth of Alphonso his confessor, who, in presence of the whole court, charged the bishops with those cruelties against which the nation exclaimed; and desired them to produce one passage in scripture, authorising them to put people to death merely for mat∣ters of faith. It was not without astonishment that the audience heard a Spa∣niard condemn persecution; and the bishops were so confounded, that for some weeks the effects of their inhuman rage were suspended: but, at the expira∣tion of that term, the barbarous flame broke out with double fury.</P>

<P>Bonner behaved with the utmost brutality of frantic zeal.

The bishops<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the Reform.</NOTE> and civil magistrates seemed to vie with each other, the first in condemning, the last in executing the unhappy protestants; till, at length, the people were provoked almost to rebellion against such monsters; and then their processes were for some time interrupted. By the intercession of Philip the princess Elizabeth was released from Wodestoke, and allowed to reside in a little country∣house, where knowing herself under the observation of spies, she applied to study, and made some progress in learning; but she was obliged to conform to the established religion, otherwise she must have fallen a victim to the ill offices of Gardiner, who eagerly wished for an opportunity to accomplish her

<P>The queen was now seized with a scruple of conscience<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under which she became very uneasy. She po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>essed some of the lands which had be∣longed to mona<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teries; and pope Julius III. notwithstanding his compromising that affair by means of cardi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Pole, had published a bull, excommunicating all those who had seized the lands of the church, or of religious communities, as well as all the princes by whom such invaders were favoured and assisted. Mary believing herself far advanced in her pregnancy, would not run the risque of dying in a state of excommunication. She declared to her ministers, that she was resolved to resign all the church-lands that were in her possession; and or∣dered them to deliver a list to the cardinal legate. Julius III. dying about this period, was succeeded in the papacy by cardinal Marcellus Cervinus, who did not many days survive his exaltation. When the tidings of his death ar∣rived in England, the queen took some measures for elevating Pole to the pon∣tificate; but the conclave elected cardinal Caraffa, who assumed the name of Paul IV. one of the most proud, arrogant, and ambitious pontiffs who had ever possessed the see of Rome. He refused to give audience to the English am∣bassadors,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> because Mary assumed the title of queen of Ireland; but, as the English envoys would not give up that addition, he thought proper to erect Ireland into a kingdom by virtue of his pontifical power.

<P>During these revolutions at Rome, the English council being in∣formed that the justices of the peace, and particularly those of Norfolk, favoured the protestants, sent them instructions to conduct themselves in another manner, and maintain spies upon those of the reformed religion. This order favoured so much of an inquisition, that the nation in general believed, it was suggested by the Spaniards, against whom the people conceived an implacable hatred. The se∣verities already practised had excited such murmurs, that even Bonner re∣strained his furious zeal, and dismissed several persons who were sent to him, accused of here<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y; till, at length, the queen and her consort, scandalized at his moderation, wrote a letter, exhorting him to obey as usual the dictates of his duty. Thus animated, he renewed the persecution with redoubled violence. John Cardmaker a prebendary at Bath, John Warne an upholsterer in Lon∣don, Thomas Hawkes a gentleman of E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ex, John Sampson, and John Audley husbandmen, Thomas Watts a linen-draper, Nicholas Chamberlain a weaver, Thomas Osmund a fuller, and William Baniford another weaver, were com∣mitted to the flames for having denied the real presence in the Eucharist. Even one Tool, who was hanged for robbery, having expressed some doubts about transubstantiation at the gallows, underwent a trial after his death; and his body was burned for heresy. These victims were followed by Bradford the protes∣tant preacher, who had, with the assistance of Rogers already executed, saved the life of Bourn now promoted to the see of Bath and Wells. He was burned at Smithfield, together, with John Lease, an apprentice nineteen years of age. Several persons suffered at Canterbury, and other places; and among them Margaret Polly, the first woman who died for heresy in Mary's reign.</P>

old Latimer aud Ridley, who were convicted and condemned, though par∣dons were offered to them, if they would recant. When they were brought to the stake before Baliol college, Ridley said to his fellow sufferer, <Q>“Be of good heart, brother; for God will either assuage the flame, or enable us to abide it.”</Q> And Latimer consoled him in his turn, saying, <Q>“We shall this day light such a candle in England, as I trust by God's grace, shall never be put out.”</Q> They bore their fate with admirable courage and constancy; and were two of the best men who had hitherto suffered in England for religion. Gardiner was so eager after the blood of those prelates, that he would not dine on the day of their suffering, until he received the news of their death, which did not arrive till four o'clock in the afternoon. Then he ate his meal with marks of uncom∣mon satisfaction; but was that same evening seized with a suppression of urine, which in less than a week brought him to his grave.

<P>In summer the queen had supposed herself seized with the pains of child-bed, and couriers were prepared, to carry the news of her delivery into different countries. The report of her having brought forth a son was diffused into different counties of England. The bishop of Norwich caused Te Deum to be sung in his cathedral for the birth of a prince, and a certain priest ven∣tured to describe the lineaments of the child, from the pulpit. But, all the queen's hopes vanished at her bringing forth a substance known by the name of Mola, to her own unspeakable grief, as well as to the astonishment of the whole court, and the confusion of Philip, who had flattered himself with the prospect of uniting England and Spain by the issue of this marriage. This disappointment did not help to soften Mary's disposition. Informations were given of some pretended conspiracies in Dorsetshire and Essex, and several persons were imprisoned, and put to the torture; but, nothing was discovered, and the whole was supposed to be a calumny invented by the priests against the favourers of the reformation. Mary set on foot a rigorous inquisition against those who had pillaged churches and monasteries in the time of the visitation; and they were now obliged to compound for their rapine, by disgorging the best part of the booty. Philip losing all hope of having children by the queen, and conceiving a disgust to her person, which was by no means agreeable; being moreover, informed of his father's intention to resign his dominions; he quitted the kingdom, and retired to Flanders, leaving his consort extremely chagrined at his distaste and indifference. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Burn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</NOTE></P>

On the twelfth day of September, Brooks bi∣shop of Gloucester, as the pope's subdelegate, together with two commissioners from the king and queen, had condemned Cranmer at Oxford, for heresy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>6.</NOTE> and on the fourteenth day of February, Bonner and Thirleby were sent thither to degrade that prelate. He was cloathed in derision with pontifical robes of coarse canvas, and Bonner having insulted him with the most indecent raillery, ordered him to be stripped of his ludicrous attire, according to the ceremony of degradation used in the church of Rome. Thirleby wept bitterly during this whole scene, protesting to Cranmer, that this was the most sorrowful action of his whole life; and that nothing but the queen's peremptory com∣mand could have induced him to be present at the affliction and distress of a person with whom he had lived in the most perfect friendship. After the arch∣bishop's condemnation, a great number of divines both English and Spaniards, assailed him in different shapes, with a view to make him a proselyte to their opinions. They threatened and soothed him by turns; they flattered him with promise of a pardon; and in a word, tampered with the infirmities of his nature, so effectually, that he subscribed an abjuration, renouncing all the errors of Lu∣ther and Zwinglius, acknowledging the pope's supremacy, the seven sacraments, the corporal presence in the Eucharist, purgatory, prayers for the dead, and the invocation of saints. His recantation was immediately printed, and furnished the popish party with infinite matter of triumph and exultation, while the protestants were overwhelmed with dejection and disgrace. The queen now exhibited a sig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al proof of her own revengeful disposition. She had affected to forgive the archbishop for the crimes committed against her as his sovereign, in full expectation of his being burned as an heretic; but, being disappointed in this hope, by his recantation, she pulled off the masque, and signed a warrant for his execution. He was conducted to St. Mary's, where being placed in a conspi∣cuous part of the church, Cole provost of Eaton preached a sermon, in which
<PB N="703" REF="7150"/>
he magnified Cranmer's conversion as the immediate work of God's inspiration. He then flattered the archbishop with the hope of heaven; and assured him, that diriges and masses should be said for his soul in all the churches of Oxford. During the whole sermon, Cranmer expressed the utmost anxiety and internal agitation, lifting up his eyes to heaven, shedding a torrent of tears, and groaning with unutterable anguish. When he was desired to declare his faith, he prayed with the most pathetic expressions of horror and remorse. He then made a short but moving exhortation to the people; repeated the creed of the apostles, de∣clared his belief of the Scriptures, confessed that he had signed a paper con∣trary to his conscience, from the apprehension of death, for which reason the hand that subscribed the recantation should first feel the torture of the fire. He renounced the pope as the enemy of Christ, and professed the same opinion of the Sacrament which he had published in a book written on that subject. The assembly consisting chiefly of papists, who hoped to triumph still further in the last words of such a convert, were equally confounded and incensed at this declaration. They called aloud to him to leave off dissembling, and pull∣ing him down, led him to the stake at which Latimer and Ridley had suffered, upbraiding him by the way with this second apostasy. When the fire was kindled, he stretched forth his right hand to the flame, in which he held it until it was intirely consumed, exclaiming from time to time, <Q>“That unworthy hand!”</Q> but, exhibiting no other signs of pain or disorder. He continued to pour forth pious ejaculations until he expired; and after his body was de∣stroyed, his heart was found intire among the ashes. Such was the unworthy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> fate of Thomas Cranmer archbishop of Canterbury, who with a very small alloy of human weakness and irresolution, possessed all the candour, simplicity, meekness and benevolence of a primitive christian.</P>

<P>On the very day of his death cardinal Pole was put in possession<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> of his archbishopric, in consequence of bulls which he had already received from the pope, at the queen's desire. The persecution still raged with unceasing fury, under the conduct of Bonner, who sent the poor wretches in troops to the stake, without distinction of age, sex, or circumstance. Thirteen were sacrificed together in one fire at Stratford le Bow; and in the island of Guernsey, a scene of almost incredible barbarity was acted. A mother and her two daughters being committed to the flames, one of them being married, and in the last month of her pregnancy, was, by the violence of the pain, taken in labour, and produced an infant, which a humane by-stander rescued from the fire. But, after some consultation, the magistrate who superintended the execution, ordered the innocent to be thrown back into the flames, where it perished with the mother. When we consider the barbarity of those proceedings against poor, harmless people, who had committed no outrage against the established govern∣ment, or religion, but been condemned for simple answers touching their be∣lief, extorted from them by violence, we can hardly believe the perpetrators were the children of human nature, far less the servants of Christ, whose doc∣trine was mercy and benevolence. They looked rather like the ministers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> infernal malice, let loose upon a wretched world. Within the compass of this year, fourscore and five persons, men, women, and children, the lame, the blind, and the ignorant, suffered death, because they would not believe in purgatory, transubstantiation, and other popish tenets, which are now justly exploded by
<PB N="704" REF="7160"/>
the church of England. Nothing could be more impolitic than this inhuman persecution; for, opinions are rivetted by opposition. The indignation of all moderate people was arroused by such barbarity: the surprising resolution with which the martyrs suffered the most painful death, diffused a general no∣tion of their sanctity, and inhanced the merit of the religion which they pro∣fessed: so that this frantic zeal of the papists, in a great measure contributed to the subsequent establishment of the reformation.</P>

<P>While the ministry thus endeavoured to extirpate the protestant religion, the queen resolved to strengthen the interest of the Roman catholics, by restoring some old, and founding some new monasteries. She certainly would have re-established all the religious houses which had been suppressed, if the fear of disobliging the nobility had not deterred her from the execution of her design. Several members of the lower house in the last session, hearing such a proposal mentioned, layed their hands upon their swords, saying, They knew how to defend their property. Mary being informed of this opposition, postponed her scheme to a more favourable opportunity. In the mean time, she commissioned Bonner and others, to eraze from the public registers, all her father's transactions against the monks and the pope, particularly, on account of the visitations, and the renunciation of the papal authority, made by the monks and abbots. Nor was the queen's attention so much ingrossed by the affairs of religion, but that she intermeddled in the interests of the continent. She had offered her mediation between France and Spain, and the ambassadors of both nations had assembled between Calais and Ardres; but the peace was retarded by the elevation of Paul IV. to the papacy. This pontiff was outrageously proud, insolent, and ambitious, though already four∣score years of age. He was an inveterate enemy to the Colonesi; and his two nephews persuaded him, that the king of Spain, who supported that family, had formed a conspiracy against his life. They pretended to have discovered the particulars of this plot, in letters to the duke of Alva governor of Naples, which letters they had intercepted. Cardinal Colonna was imprisoned, the envoys of Philip and Mary were put under arrest, and the pope seized Palliano<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> and Nettuno, two places belonging to the Colonesi. Then he declared war against the king of Spain, and sollicited the assistance of the French monarch; promising to aid him in his turn with all his forces for the conquest of Naples. The proposal being supported by the cardinal of Lorrain, a league offensive and defensive was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igned at Rome; but this was almost rendered ineffectual by the mediation of Mary, in consequence of which a truce for five years was con∣cluded between France and Spain. The pope being thus abandoned by his ally, the duke of Alva began to approach the city of Rome, after having taken Ostia, and some other places; but, the cardinal Cara<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a being sent as legate a latere to Paris, managed his intrigues with such art and success, that the king of France broke the truce, without alledging any other cause than that of the pope's being oppressed by the Spaniards.</P>

As they did not appear, they were condemned to be burned for heresy; and their remains being dug up, were consumed to
<PB N="705" REF="7170"/>
ashes at Oxford. The wife of Peter Martyr was likewise taken out of her grave, and buried in a dunghil, because she had been a nun, and broken her vow of celibacy. The magistrates began to be ashamed of acting as instruments of such unheard of barbarity, and relaxed so much in their diligence, that the council sent circular letters, exhorting them to redouble their zeal in the pro∣secution of heretics. The queen, being incensed at hearing from all quarters that the number of protestants daily increased, notwithstanding the executions, began to entertain thoughts of establishing an inquisition in England. As a previous step to this measure she renewed the commission of the preceding year, impowering one and twenty commissioners to judge heretics of all ranks with unlimited authority. The persecution revived, and seventy-nine persons were committed to the flames. During these transactions, the duke of Guise marched with an army into the kingdom of Naples, from whence he was soon recalled by the pope to the relief of Rome, which was hard pressed by the duke of Alva.</P>

<P>Philip, exasperated at Henry of France, for having broken the truce, levied an army of fifty thousand men to act in Picardy; and, by divers artifices and insinuations, prevailed upon his consort Mary to espouse his quar∣rel. She granted commissions to the sheriffs and justices of the peace to enlist soldiers, that they might be ready to march at the first notice. In the interim one Stafford having received some assistance from the court of France, assem∣bled some English refugees; and, embarking in a vessel, landed in Scotland. From thence marching to S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arborough, he surprized the castle, and published a manifesto, in which he affirmed that Mary had forfeited all right to the crown, by introducing Spaniards into the kingdom, of which he declared himself the protector. But his success was of very short duration; the earl of Westmoreland having raised some troops, retook Scarborough, in which he found Stafford and three of his accomplices, who were executed at London. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Godwin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE></P>

<P>On the twentieth day of May king Philip arrived in England, where by this time eight thousand men were ready to embark for the Low Countries; and the queen, having sent a herald to declare war against France, these troops were transported, on the seventeenth day of June, under the com∣mand of the earl of Pembroke, who joined the Spanish army commanded by the duke of Savoy: then Philip returned to Brussels. The Spanish general having invested St. Quentin, the constable of France detached the admiral de Chatillon with three thousand men, to throw himself into the place. He found means to enter with seven hundred; but the rest were bewildered in the night. With this reinforcement he defended the place vigorously, in expectation of being relieved by his uncle the constable, who being greatly inferior in number to the allies, contented himself with introducing the admiral's brother d'An∣delot, with a supply of five hundred men; but, in return from this expedition, he was attacked, routed, and taken prisoner by the duke of Savoy, after two thousand five hundred men had been killed upon the spot. In this action, which was fought on the tenth day of August, and thence called the battle of St. Lau∣rence, besides the constable Montmorency and his son, the dukes of Mont∣pensier and Longueville, Ludovico Gonzaga, brother to the duke of Mantua, the marechal St. Andre, the Rhingrave Roche-dumain, the count de Roche foucault, the baron of Curton, and many other persons of distinction, fell into

the hands of the Spaniards. Among the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain were John duke of Enghien, the viscount of Turenne, the lords of Chandinier and Pontdormy, and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">God<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> great number of officers. France was overwhe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med with such consternation at the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of this disaster, that if the duke of Savoy had marched directly to Paris, he might have entered that city without opposition: but he proceeded to the siege of St. Quentin, which in a few days he took by assault; when the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, with his brother, and all that survived of the garrison were made prisoners.

<P>When his holiness first understood that the queen of England had declared war against France, he was violently exasperated against cardinal Pole, as if he had advised that measure, and would have recalled him imme∣diately, had not Carne, the English ambassador, represented the injury that he would do to religion by such a procedure; but when the news of the battle arrived he was seized with a transport of rage, and resolved to sacrifice Pole to his revenge. He sent for Payton, the queen's confessor, to Rome, where he bestowed upon him a cardinal's hat, appointed him legate in England, and dismissed him with a decree, by which Pole was recalled. But the queen, be∣ing informed of this mandate, gave notice to Payton, that should he attempt to set foot in England, she would cause him to be punished with all the rigour<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> of the Premuni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. This letter stopped the new cardinal in his journey; and Pole, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hough he had not received the pope's decretal, abstained from all the functions of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> legate, that he might not furnish the pontiff with a pretence to take any step to his prejudice. Nevertheless, the pope, finding himself unable to cope with the duke of Alva, concluded a peace with Spain; and, by an article of the treaty, Pole was re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>established in his legation.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The French king created the duke of Guise his lieutenant∣general for the whole kingdom of France, and excited the queen-regent of Scotland to infringe the peace with Mary. As she could not prevail upon the states of the kingdom to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omply with her wishes, she ordered Aymouth to be fortified, contrary to an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rticle of the last treaty; and the English opposing this measure by force of arms, a rupture ensued. D'Oysel, at the head of the Scot∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish army, entered the frontiers of England, but he was immediately recalled by an express order of the parliament; and the queen regent advised Henry of France to hasten the marriage between the dauphin and her daughter Mary; that he, being master of Scotland, might exert his authority with the natives. Henry relished this advice, in consequence of which he sent ambassadors to regulate the articles of the marriage with the parliament of Scotland. In the latter end of the year Philip sent intimation to Mary, that the court of France had projected some scheme against Calais, and offered to supply her with troops for the guard of that fortress, which was in a defenceless condition. The council looked upon this intimation as a stratagem of Philip to gain possession of Calais; and the queen not only declined accepting his offer, but also neg∣lected to put the place in a posture of defence, notwithstanding the repeated follicitations of lord Wentworth the governor. The ministry was too much engro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed by religious affairs to bestow proper attention upon this object of importance. In the beginning of the year Calais was invested by the duke of Guise, who, having taken by assault the two forts of Newnambridge and Ris
<PB N="707" REF="7190"/>
bank, battered the town, and obliged the governor to surrender on the seventh day of the siege. He was no sooner master of the place, than he expelled all the English inhabitants: then he sat down before Guifnes, in which the lord Grey commanded: but the garrison, consisting of eleven hundred m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, were so dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouraged by the loss of Calais, that at the first attack they retired to the citadel, where they sustained another assault, and then surrendered themselves<NOTE PLACE="marg">Godwin.</NOTE> prisoners of war. The castle of Hames, being situated in a morass which was almost inaccessible, might have made a vigorous resistance; but the garrison abandoned it, and fled at the approach of the enemy. Thus, within the space of fifteen days, in the middle of winter, all that remained of the English conquests in France, was lost by the ignorance and neglect of the queen and council; and this was the fruit of the alliance between England and Spain.</P>

<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The loss of Calais filled the whole kingdom of England with murmurs and complaints: the ministry were so confounded, that they could not open their mouths in their own justification, and the queen felt all the pangs of the most mortifying disappointment. Philip pressed her to make a power∣ful effort for the recovery of the place, before the French should have time to repair the fortifications: but the ministers could not find means to execute such an enterprize; and they were afraid that the undertaking would detach their attention too much from the concerns of religion. The parliament, meeting on the twentieth day of January, granted a subsidy to the queen, and she re∣ceived another from the clergy. Some of the partisans of the court, proposing an act for giving the force of a law to all the queen's proclamations, one of the members opposed the proposition, alledging that the queen, by virtue of such an unlimited power, might, by a simple proclamation, alter the succession. The house, offended at this member's suspicion, committed him to the Tower; but no further mention was made of the act, because, in all probability, Mary perceived the nation was attached to the right of the princess Elizabeth, who, after the prorogation of the parliament, was demanded in marriage by the king of Sweden; but she rejected his proposal. In the month of April the dauphin espoused Mary queen of Scotland; and, in June, Philip king of Spain, by his general the count d'Egmont, obtained a complete victory over the French at Gravelines, where the French general de Termes and his principal offers were taken. This victory was in a great measure owing to ten English men of war, which chancing to sail along shore, while the battle was maintained with equal f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry on both sides, made a terrible slaughter among the French with their cannon, insomuch that the rout began from this quarter. About the same time, lord Clinton, high admiral of England, with a fleet of one hundred and forty ships, made a descent upon Conquest in Normandy, which he took and plundered; but some of the Flemings, that were on board the navy, making an excursion farther into the country, were attacked and routed by the militia; and the ad∣miral retired to his ships with precipitation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ward.</NOTE></P>

<P>Mean while the persecution was renewed in England with fresh fury. The queen ordered, by proclamation, that those who should receive heretical books, without delivering them immediately to the magistrate, should be forthwith executed by martial law; and all persons were forbidden to pray for such as suffered on account of heresy. A man, of the name of Bambridge, being condemned to the flames in Hampshire, and unable to bear the torture,
<PB N="708" REF="7200"/>
cried aloud, "I recant, I recant." The sheriff immediately ordered the fire to be extinguished, and the man signed an abjuration. But the court sent down an order to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn this unhappy wretch even after his recantation, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she∣riff was committed prisoner to the Fleet, for having presumed to suspend the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> execution.
