<HEAD>AN Impartial HISTORY Of the REIGN of King <HI>GEORGE.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T would be a Satyr upon the Reign of the King, to suggest that it would not bear an Im∣partial History; and it would be much more a Satyr upon those who read these Sheets, to say they should dislike them for their being Impartial.</P>
<P>As if it was impossible to write as an Historian, without mingling with the relations of Fact, the Reflections, the Reproaches, and the Excursions
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
of the Passions of Men, who on one Side or other, have carried Faction and Party-Quarrel to such an extravagant height in this Reign.</P>
<P>If I meet with these unhappy Things in my way, as who can trace the Actions of contend∣ing Parties, without jostling sometimes with their Failings and Follies, I shall endeavour to repre∣sent them in the most favourable manner on either side, and make no Reflections upon them, except in such Cases wherein they shall acknowledge those Reflections to be natural and just.</P>
<P>I cannot promise to oblige those Readers who had rather be deceived than inform'd, who can∣not read with Pleasure, except they find their Author as warm in History as they are in their Discourse, and unless one Party is crush'd, and the other espoused: Such Gentlemen would do well to take up with those who write after that manner: And I doubt not but each Side may find Authors to please them, especially as Times now go.</P>
<P>As for this Work, its Title is an <HI>Impartial Hi∣story,</HI> and such they shall find it: The King shall have all that Justice and Regard which Duty commands, as well to his Majesty's Person and Interest as to the just Merit of his Administration: His Servants and Friends shall be spoken of with Honour, with Truth, and with good Manners; and yet all shall be unmix'd with surfeiting Panegy∣rick, and the unmanly Flattery which truly glorious Princes abhor to receive, and Men of sense to give.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
I shall have no Reserve here in Favour of any Party, if any Expression shall be subject to a <HI>double Construction,</HI> and Party-Malice shall guide the un∣charitable Thoughts of any to take <HI>the worst:</HI> Be the Shame to themselves, who mean evil, and suspect others. I shall, as much as possible, avoid giving such any Advantage, or laying my self o∣pen to their Gensure.</P>
<P>The Work is a History, not a Satyr; Relation of Fact is the Business, not Rallery at Parties or Persons. If any Gentlemen have fallen under the Weight of Publick Justice, it is enough that I give an Account how they came to the Disaster, and what End their Miscarriages have brought them to; without following their Me∣mories with Reproaches beyond the Grave, or Descanting in Tryumph over their Miseries.</P>
<P>Men of Misfortune should be treated with Decency, let their Crime be what it will; 'tis enough to Record the Mistake they fall under, and leave them at the Place of Execution, where the Law has left them.</P>
<P>And all this I hope may be without taking Part with any Body. As to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> I shall speak of him as he ought to be spoken of, without entring into any Disputes about him: In which I shall no more favour his Interest, than a <HI>Painter</HI> may be said to take part with an Enemy, when he describes a Battle, because he does not Picture the routed Side in the Shape of Devils and Mon sters.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Rebellion shall be treated with Justice, and yet even the Rebels not be insulted; their Follies, their Temerity, and the inexpressible Error of their Conduct, shall not be hid in Favour of them, or ex∣patiated in Triumph. I shall even venture to pity their Misfortunes, and yet not fear being so much as suspected of favouring their Designs.</P>
<P>The Clemency of the Government shall not be lessen'd by Reflections upon its being too late, or advanc'd beyond it self for being too soon; Nor shall I hide the Mistakes of those, to whose Folly their own Friends acknowledge they owe its com∣ing no sooner.</P>
<P>In a Word, and to shorten all Preambles, Friend and Enemy shall, with the utmost Impar∣tiality, have Justice done them in this History, and as little Offence be given to any Side as possible.</P>

<HEAD>AN Impartial HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>QUEEN <HI>Ann</HI> of truly <HI>English</HI> Memory, Dy'd the 1st of <HI>August,</HI> 1714, about 8 a Clock in the Morning. The Council had been assembled in an Extraordinary Manner for 2 or 3 Days before, upon Intimation from the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> Lord High-Treasurer, that there was no room left to expect Her Majesty's Life, and the Physitians go∣ing and returning continually between the Coun∣cil Chamber, and the Queen's Bed-Chamber, to give an Account how Things were.</P>
<P>During this mournful Interval, as it may very justly be call'd, the Queen being as it were nei∣ther dead or living, but drawing her last Breath, the Doors of the Council Chamber were set open, and many of the Nobility that appear'd, at least of those who bore the Character of Privy-Coun∣cellors, though not summon'd in the Ordinary Way, were admitted; there being no more now before them, but to sit still, and expect when the News should be brought, That the Queen was expir'd, and then to act as the Constitution directed.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
It must not be omitted here, this being the proper Place for it, That among all the Nobili∣ty that appear'd on this Occasion at Court, as well those in the Administration, and nearest to the Queen, as others; there was not the least Hesitation in, or so much as an Enquiry about what was before them; I mean as to the Successi∣on of the Crown: The House of <HI>Hanover</HI> was so natural to the Establishment made in Parliament, that no Man so much as ask'd the Question, Who was next Heir? or, Who ought to succeed? But the Eyes of the Nation, as one Man, turn'd all the same Way; and if any secret Wishes were en∣tertain'd, there was not the least room to bring them out, no not so much as in Words.</P>
<P>As soon as Word was brought to the Council, that the Queen was dead, the Lords broke up, and adjourn'd to the Cockpit, where there was quickly a General Appearance of all the Nobili∣ty, and Persons of Rank that were in Town, as is usual on such Occasions; and where it was una∣nimously agreed, That the Elector of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> Duke of <HI>Hanover,</HI> was the only True Lawful and Rightful Successor to the Crown: What Designs there were to destroy that Settlement, or who were guilty of such Designs, if any were, seems rather the Subject of future History, than of Political Reflections before-hand: As far as such Designs are judicially prov'd, so far it will be the Business of an Historian to record them; and what ap∣pears of that kind, shall be stated with the same Impartiallity that we Profess in the whole Series of this Work. A Proclamation being order'd to be immediately prepar'd, and the Heralds attend∣ing, the King was accordingly proclaim'd at <HI>White-Hall-Gate,</HI> with all the usual Ceremonies;
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
and all the Nobility and Gentry present, having first sign'd the Proclamation, went in their Coaches to attend the Proclaiming His Majesty in the Ci∣ty, at the usual Places, and last of all, at the <HI>Royal-Exchange;</HI> and thus the Day which begun in Sorrow, ended with Joy, and the People gave all possible Demonstrations of their Satisfaction, in Bonfires, Illuminations, and the usual Extrava∣gancies of such Occasions.</P>
<P>While these Things were doing, Expresses were dispatch'd in the Heels of one another to <HI>Hanover, as well First,</HI> To give His Majesty, then Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> notice of the Queen's Condition, and that there was no Probability that Her Majesty could recover; as also to intimate in what good Dispositions every thing stood in Relation to His Electoral Highness's Succession, and that there was no room to doubt its being effectually secur'd; <HI>as afterwards</HI> to let His Majesty know, That the Queen was dead, and how not only peaceably, and without the least Reluctance, much less Di∣sturbance; but with an Universal Appearance of Joy, and Satisfaction, His Majesty's Accession had been receiv'd, and His Title Proclaim'd, in∣viting His Majesty with the greatest Expressions of Duty and Affection, to come over with what speed his Affairs would admit, to take Possession of the Crown.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI> was the Person sent over by the Council with this last Message, and the Baron <HI>Bothmar</HI> had signify'd the first Part by his Secre∣tary, with whom, or immediately before, went another Person of Quality, Mr. <HI>Craggs,</HI> since made Secretary of State, sent over by the particular Friends of His Electoral Highness, and since ad∣vanc'd to several Posts of Trust in the Government.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
In order to make this History be a compleat Record of Fact, it is needful to set down more fully than ordinary, the first Steps of the King's Accession, that remarkable Transaction being such, as is not likely to occur again in many Ages, and perhaps never.</P>
<P>The Act of Settlement of the Succession, in which those Things were specifically expressed, and by which the Measures of Conduct on both Sides were prescrib'd, had directed the Establish∣ment of a Regency, which upon the Demise of the last Heir in Possession, should take Place, and should be empower'd to act in the Name of the Successor, till the said Successor should ar∣rive, which Regency were to consist of seven of the chief Officers of the Crown, for the Time be∣ing, and such other Persons, as by an Instrument under the Hand and Seal of the Successor, should by Virtue of that Act be nominated and appoint∣ed; the said Instrument to be seal'd up in three several Parts, one Part to be committed to the Custody of such Persons as the said Act directs, not to be open'd till the Succession was to take Place; but least this Account should not fully describe this, because of the Constitution, and the Proceedings, I refer to the Words of the Sta∣tute, which are easily to be found.</P>
<P>Pursuant to this Act, an Instrument in Form was sign'd, in three Parts, by the Elector of <HI>Han∣over,</HI> and was committed to the keeping of the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> the Lord Chancellor, and Monsieur <HI>Kreyenberg,</HI> then Resident here from the Elector; and these Persons severally produ∣cing the same in Council, the said Council being met at St. <HI>James</HI>'s; as soon as the Queen's Death
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
was known, the Regency was immediately known also, and took Place accordingly.</P>
<P>But it must be noted, That after the said Instru∣ments were read and receiv'd, and yet before the Lords Commission'd thereby, and by the Act of Settlement began to Act, the Lords of the Coun∣cil having invited, as is usual in such Cases, all the Nobility, Persons of Quality, the Lord-Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and Principal Citizens to joyn with them, proceeded to proclaim the King; and this not only by Form of a Proclamation, but by the reading the said Proclamation with Sound of Trumpet, at the Gate of the Palace; and so on in all the usual Places of the City: All the said Nobility and Persons of Note attending in Ca∣valcade, as usual; which also was attended with the usual Acclamations of the People, and fol∣low'd by the like Publick Proclaiming the King all over the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Proclamation with the Names annex'd to it, is as follows,</P>
<P>WHEREAS <HI>it hath pleased Almighty God to call to his Mercy, our late Sovereign Lady Queen</HI> Ann, <HI>of Blessed Memory, by whose Decease the Imperial Crowns of</HI> Great Britain, France <HI>and</HI> Ire∣land, <HI>are solely, and rightfully come to the High and Mighty Prince,</HI> GEORGE, <HI>Elector of</HI> Brunswick-Lunenburg: <HI>We therefore the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the Realm, being here assisted with these of Her late Majesty's Privy Council, with Numbers of other Principal Gentlemen of Quality, with the</HI> Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, <HI>and Citizens of</HI> London; <HI>do now hereby, with en full Voice, and Consent of Tangue, and Heart, Publish and Proclaim, That the High and Mighty Prince,</HI> GEORGE, <HI>Elector of</HI> Brunswick-Lunenburg,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<HI>is now by the Death of our late Sovereign of Happy Memory, become our only Lawful and Right∣ful Liege Lord.</HI> GEORGE, <HI>By the Grace of God, King of</HI> Great Britain, France <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>Defen∣der of the Faith,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>To whom we do acknowledge all Faith, and constant Obedience, with all hearty and humble Affection; beseeching God, by whom Kings and Queens reign, te bless the Royal King</HI> GEORGE, <HI>with long and happy Years to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>Given at the Palace of St. <HI>James</HI>'s, the first Day of <HI>August,</HI> 1714</P>

<P>From, and immediately upon this, the Lords Justices, or Lords of the Regency, began to act; and the first Matter of Note, proper to the pre∣sent purpose, which came before them, was to dispatch their Orders into <HI>Scotland</HI> to have the like Proclamation published there, according to the Usage of the Kingdom; which was perform'd accordingly, by the Orders of the Earl of <HI>Isla,</HI> then Lord Justice General of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Duke of <HI>Montross,</HI> one of the Lords of the Regency, be∣ing present, and at the Head of the procession. This was the 4th of <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>The Proclamation there, I omit for want of room here, as also not being so absolutely need∣ful, it being the same, <HI>Mutatis Mutandis,</HI> as the above Proclamation for <HI>England;</HI> to which I refer.</P>
<P>The same Measures were taken for Proclaming the King in <HI>Ireland:</HI> And such speed the Messen∣gers made, and so good a Passage they had, that the Orders of the Lords of the Regency arrived at <HI>Dublin</HI> the 6th, and the King was immediately Proclaimed there, with all the usual Solemnity, and with the same Proclamation <HI>Mutatis Mutandis</HI> as above.</P>
<P>Due Measures having thus been taken for Pro∣claiming the King in all Parts of his Dominini∣ons, the Lords of the Regency proceeded in the necessary Administration of the executive Power;
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
and first they dispatch'd the proper Military Offi∣cers to their respective Posts, in all Parts of the Kingdom, in order to preserve the Peace, and to be ready upon every Exigence for the Defence of the Places they had in Charge. The Garrisons upon the Coast were also order'd to be reinforced by Detachments of Troops, particularly that of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> and <HI>Shereness,</HI> as the Two Keys of the Royal Navy; And Vessels were order'd, one to View the Sea Ports of <HI>France,</HI> to see if any Arma∣ment was in hand there, or any Preparations at which Umbrage might be taken; but they report∣ed, That all was quiet there, and no appearance of any Preparations of any kind.</P>
<P>These Orders being issued, they chose Mr. <HI>Ad∣dison, the same who has since been made Secretary of State,</HI> to be Secretary of the Regency, and order∣ed all the Dispatches directed to the Secretaries of State to be sent to him, superceding thereby the Offices of the Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bromley,</HI> who were Secretaries of State at the time of the Queen's Decease, and continued in the Office of Secretary by Vertue of the Act of Parliament for Six Months.</P>
<P>On the 5th they Issued a Proclamation for Con∣tinuing all Persons in their Employments and Of∣fices, till his Majesty's Pleasure should be farther known, appointing them to take the Oaths re∣quir'd by Act of Parliament, and to perform such other Things as the Law requir'd them to per∣form, to qualifie them for keeping their said Posts respectively.</P>
<P>And that we may take all things with us as we go, it must be observ'd, That pursuant to the Act of Settlement, which appoints that the Parlia∣ment in Being, at the Demise of the Prince, shall
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
immediately assemble, without any Summons or Call, in the same manner as if they were not un∣der any Prorogation or Adjournment: <HI>I say,</HI> Pur∣suant to the said Act, the Parliament assemembled, <HI>that is to say, as many Members as were at hand,</HI> the very same day that the Queen died. It took them up some time to requallifie their Members; du∣ring which Interval, the Speaker, Mr.—, be∣ing then absent in the Country, had Notice sent him by Express, and came up Post to the House, where he appear'd the 4th; so the House being constituted, the Lords of the Regency went in a Body the next day to the Upper-House, and the Commons being sent for, the Lord Chancellor made, or rather read, the following Speech to both Houses: I say Read, because the Contents were perus'd, approv'd, and the Expressions limi∣ted, in the Council of the Regency, before they went up. The Speech is as follows,</P>
<P><Q>My Lords and Gentlemen,</Q></P>
<P><HI>IT is with great Satisfaction we can now tell you, That we have this Morning received a Letter from the King, wherein his Majesty is graciously pleased to acquaint us, That his Majesty is hastening hither to employ his utmost Care for putting these Kiagdoms into a happy and flourishing Condition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He has commanded us in the mean time, to continue our Care of every thing that may conduce to the Peace and Safety of his Dominions: And we are assured, That if this had required his more immediate Presence, he would without delay have repaired hither for the Sup∣port of so Dutiful and Faithful Subjects: For his Majesty does very particularly express his great Satis∣faction in the Loyalty and Affection which his People have universally shewn upon his Majesty's Accession to the Crown</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
<HI>At the opening this Session, we did not mention to you the Apprehensions we then had from the Smallness of the Sum at that time advanced, that the Lottery would not be full, being desirous in the first place to try to make it effectual in the manner the Parliament had established it; but we are obliged now to acquaint you, That all our Endeavours have failed of the desired Success, tho' the Contributions have been thereby conside∣rably increased.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We must therefore earnestly recommend to you,</HI> Gen∣tlemen of the House of Commons, <HI>to take this into your Consideration, and to give such further Encourage∣ment as you shall think proper for raising the whole Sum which was intended, and is absolutely necessary for car∣rying on the Service of the Year.</HI></P>
<P>The Loyal Proceedings of this Parliament, their readiness in Concurring with every Proposal made to them for the Publick Good, the Unanimity in which they acted in every thing for the King's In∣terest, was such, as that tho' few Writers have done Justice to them, yet the most prejudiced have not been able to fasten the least Omission or Commis∣sion upon them, or upon their Behaviour, or so much as told us why they have been so unwilling to do them that Justice which so needful and sea∣sonable an adherence to the King's Interest re∣quir'd.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do to enquire here whether or no the Complaint was just, which some have made of this Parliament's being treated with disrespect; or that the Returns made them were not suitable to the Zeal and Alacrity which they shew'd for his Majesty's Interest; it is enough to re∣cord their Dutiful and Affectionate Behaviour to the King's Interest, and to that of his
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
Succession; and let other Enquire concerning the Returns which were made them.</P>
<P>Certainly whoever shall Read the Proceedings of the short Session of Parliament in which they acted, will own that they omitted nothing on their Part, to testify their Duty and Affection to King <HI>George,</HI> or for securing his Interest and the Publick Peace in every part: And because this Point has been so little dwelt upon, it may be needful, and Justice seems to require it, that I should be as particular in this Case as the Brevity of this work will admit.</P>
<P>Upon the Return of the Commons to their House, and taking a Speech into Consideration, they immediately resolved <HI>Nemine Contradicente</HI> that an humble Address should be presented to his Majesty, to Condole and Congratulate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Lords at the same Time resolv'd upon ano∣ther: Both which Addresses were presented to the Lords of the Regency, and were by them transmitted to the King. The Addresses were as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Most Gracious Sovereign,</HI></P>
<P><HI>WE your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal Subjects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, though deeply sensible of the great Loss these Nations have sustained by the Demise of her late Ma∣jesty of blessed Memory, think it our Duty at the same time, with thankful Hearts to Almighty God, to con∣gratulate your Majesty upon your happy and peaceable Accession to your Throne: And we do with the utmost Loyalty and Duty assure your Majesty of our zealous and firm Resolutions to Support your undoubtedly Right∣ful and Lawful Title to the Crown, against all Enemies and Pretenders whatsoever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
<HI>Our Zeal and Affection for Your Majesty's Service, engage us to exert our selves with all Vigour and Una∣nimity for securing the publick Safety: And we will always, to the utmost of our Power, maintain the Ho∣nour and Dignity of Your Crown. And we do with faithful Hearts, beseech Your Majesty, as soon as possi∣ble, to give us Your Royal Presence; which we are per∣swaded will be attended with all other Blessings to Your Kingdom.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Most Gracious Sovereign,</P>
<P><HI>WE Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal Sub∣jects the Commons of</HI> Great Britain <HI>in Parlia∣ment assembled, having a just Sense of the great Loss the Nation has sustain'd by the Death of our late Sove∣reign Lady Queen</HI> Anne <HI>of Blessed memory, humbly crave Leave to condole with Your Majesty on this sad Occasion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It would but aggravate our Sorrow particularly, to enumerate the Virtues of that Pious, and most Excellent Princess, The Duty we owe to Your Majesty, and to our Country, oblige us to moderate our Grief, and heartily to Congratulate Your Majesty's Accession to the Throne; whose Princely Virtues give us a certain Pros∣pect of future Happiness in the Security of our Religion, Laws, and Liberties; and engage us to assure Your Majesty, that we will to our utmost, support Your un∣doubted Right to the Imperial Crown of this Realm against the</HI> Pretender, <HI>and all other Persons whatso∣ever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Your faithful Commons cannot but express their im∣patient Desire for Your Majesty's safe Arrival and Pre∣sence in</HI> Great Britain.</P>
<P><HI>In the mean Time, we humbly lay before Your Maje∣sty, the unanimous Resolution of this House to maintain</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
<HI>tho publick Credit of the Nation; and effectually to make good all Funds which have been granted by Parliament for the Security of any Money which has been, or shall be advanc'd for the publick Service; and to endeavour by every thing in our Power, to make Your Majesty's Reign Happy and Glorious.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The King receiving these Addresses with an agreeable and gracious Acceptance, return'd the following Answers.</P>
<Q><P>GEORGE R.</P>
<P>I <HI>Take this first Opportunity to return you my hearty Thanks for your Address, and the Assurances you have given me therein.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Zeal and Unanimity you have shewn upon my Accession to the Crown, are great Encouragements to me, and I shall always esteem the Continuance of them, as one of the greatest Blessings of my Reign.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No one can be more truly sensible, than I am, of the Loss sustain'd by the Death of the late Queen, whose exemplary Piety and Virtues so much endeared Her to Her People, and for whose Memory I shall always have a particular Regard.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My best Endeavours shall never be wanting to repair this Loss to the Nation; I will make it my constant Care to preserve your Religion, Laws, and Liberties, inviolable, and to advance the Honour and Prosperity of my Kingdoms.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I am hastening to you, according to your Desire, so affectionately express'd in your Address.</HI></P></Q>

GEORGE R.</P>
<P><HI>YOUR Dutiful and Loyal Address is very accep∣table to me, the Unanimity, and Affections my</HI> Commons <HI>have shewn upon my Accession to the Crown, are most agreeable Instances and Pledges of their Fide∣lity to me. I have a just sence of your inexpressible Loss, by the Death of your late Sovereign; you may be assured of my constant Endeavours to secure to you the full Enjoyment of your Religion, Laws, and Liberties; and that it will always be my Aim, to make you a hap∣py and flourishing People; to which your Resolution to maintain the publick Credit of the Nation, will greatly contribute. I am hastening to you, according to your earnest Desire, and the just Expectations of my Peo∣ple.</HI></P></Q>
<P>These Matters of Ceremony being over, the <HI>Commons</HI> fell immediately to taking into Conside∣ration the Speech of the <HI>Lord Chancellor</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Regency,</HI> and came to several vigorous Reso∣lutions for the publick Service, particularly, they immediately Voted the Bill of Supply for the Sup∣port of His Majesty's Houshold, and the Honour and Dignity of the Crown, that is, in a few Words, the <HI>Civil List Bill.</HI> This was perticularly ordered to be the same that the Queen Enjoy'd, that is to say, 700000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> and to begin from the Death of the Queen, only with Exception to the Revenues of the Dutchy of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> which are vested by Law in the Person of the Prince, as Duke of <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P>This Bill met with such a hearty Concurrence in the House, and was so unanimously carry'd on, that tho' it was the 7th of <HI>August</HI> when it was
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
first mov'd, it was finish'd, pass'd through both Houses, and receiv'd the Royal Assent the 14th.</P>
<P>But before I give an Account of that, I must observe, that on the 13th Mr. <HI>Craggs, Jun.</HI> the same who, at the time of the writing this Hi∣story, is one of the Secretarys of State, and who had been dispatch'd by some Persons, as above, the Evening before the Queen's Death, to give the King an account of Things, return'd from <HI>Hano∣ver,</HI> and brought the King's Letter to the Lords of the <HI>Regency;</HI> upon which, the said Regents came the same Day to the House, and the <HI>Lord Chancellor,</HI> in their Names, as before, made the following Speech to both Houses.</P>
<Q><P>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>IT hath pleased Almighty God, to take to himself our late most gracious Queen, of Blessed Memory, we hope that nothing has been omitted which might contribute to the Safety of these Realms, and the Preservation of our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, in this great Con∣juncture. As these invaluable Blessings have been se∣cured to us by those Acts of Parliament which have settled the Succession of these Kingdoms in the most Illustrious House of</HI> Hanover, <HI>we have regulated our Proceedings from those Rules which are therein prescrib'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Privy-Council, soon after the Demise of the late Queen, Assembled at</HI> St. James<HI>'s, where according to the said Acts, the three Instruments were produc'd and open'd, which had been deposited in the Hands of the Arch-Bishop of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>the</HI> Lord Chancellor, <HI>and the Resident of</HI> Brunswick. <HI>Those who either by their Office, or by Virtue of these Instruments, had the Honour of being appointed Lords Justices, did in Conjunction with the Council, immediately proceed to the Proclaim∣ing</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
<HI>of our Lawful, and Rightful Sovereign King</HI> GEORGE, <HI>taking at the same time, the necessary Care to maintain the publick Peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In pursuance of the Acts, before-mention'd, this Parliament is now assembled, and we are perswaded you all bring with you so hearty a Disposition for His Majesty's Service, and the public-Good, that we can∣not doubt of your Assistance in every thing which may promote those great Ends.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>We find it necessary to put you in mind that several Branches of the publick Revenue are expired, by the De∣mise of Her late Majesty, and to recommend to you the making such provisions in that Respect, as may be requisite to support the Honour and Dignity of the Crown. And we assure our selves, you will not be wanting in any thing that may conduce to the establishing, and advanc∣ing of the publick Credit.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>We forbear laying before you any Thing that does not require your immediate Consideration, not having re∣ceiv'd His Majesty's Pleasure. We shall only exhort you, with the greatest Earnestness, to a perfect Una∣nimity, and a firm Adherance to our Sovereign's In∣terest, as being the only Means to continue among us our present happy Tranquillity.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Upon this Speech, the Houses severally Voted Addresses of Thanks, and Assurances of Loyalty; the Vote of the <HI>House of Commons</HI> run thus, to re∣turn the Humble Thanks of the House to His Ma∣jesty, for the Satisfaction his Majesty has been pleas'd to express in the Humble Duty and Affecti∣on which His Loyal <HI>Commons</HI> have unanimously
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
shewn upon His happy Accession to the Throne; and for His gracious Assurances of His Royal In∣tentions, to make His People speedily happy by his Presence; assuring His Majesty of the continu∣ance, of their Zeal for His Service, and Affection to his Person and Government, upon all Occasi∣ons; and that they would contribute their utmost Endeavours for preserving the publick Tranquili∣ty, until His Majesty shall arrive.</P>
<P>This Address was also order'd to be presented to the Regents, in order to be transmitted to His Majesty. The Lord's Address was also to the same Purpose.</P>
<P>These Matters of Ceremony being dispatch'd, the House proceeded to take into Consideration the Lottery Bill, this Lottery it seems, being laid in the Ministry of the late Lord Treasurer, the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> at a Currant Interest but of 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and the able Hand that undertook it at that Rate, and would no Question have carry'd it through, as he had done other things more difficult by far than that, being withdrawn, and displac'd; the Job∣bers and mony'd Men in the City blow'd upon it; and notwithstanding, the Court and all its Dependencies, on that critical Occasion, for∣warded the Subscription in a publick Manner, going down in a Body to the City to Subscribe, by which Means a very great Sum of Money was Subscrib'd; yet there being still several hundred thousand Pounds wanting, the Lords of the <HI>Re∣gency</HI> found it absolutely necessary to lay it before the House, who immediately pass'd an Act to raise the Interest from 4 to 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon the Subscription: And this gave Life to the Business, and the Money was subscrib'd in a few Hours, with the greatest Allacrity possible.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
Both these Bills, <HI>viz.</HI> That of the <HI>Civil List,</HI> and this of adding 1 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Interest to the <HI>Lot∣tery,</HI> together with a Bill for rectifying some Mistakes in the Names of the Commissioners of the <HI>Land-Tax,</HI> were all pass'd and ready for the Royal Assent by the 17th, which, as was even then observ'd, was such a Testimony of the Zeal. Chearfulness and Steadiness of that Parliament in the Service and Interest of the King, as de∣serves to be recorded to Posterity, together with the open Testimony which the King himself gave to their Loyalty and Affection in all his Majesty's Letters and Answers, and on all Occasions where∣in he thought fit to make mention of them. How it came to pass afterwards, that some People en∣deavour'd to represent this very <HI>House of Commons</HI> as dangerous and disaffected, and to lessen the Re∣putation of their Conduct, I know not, or at least care not to enquire; nor is this said, to lead the Reader to any Reflections upon the sudden Dissolu∣tion of the House afterwards, even without giving them the Honour of seeing the King's Face among them, for whose Interest they had so heartily em∣bark'd: all those things I leave as they come to Hand, for every one to judge of as they think sit.</P>
<P>However the <HI>Commons</HI> have not left themselves without a Testimony of their own Behaviour, in that eminent Speech which the Speaker made at the Bar of the <HI>House of Lords,</HI> when he presented the Bills abovenam'd, to the Lords <HI>the Regents,</HI> for the Royal Assent; in which the Speaker boldly asserts, the Zeal and Fidelity of the <HI>House of Commons;</HI> and is not afraid, even to make some Pretences to it, from the Pledge or Earnest which he brought then to his Majesty, as well of what was past, as of
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
their Resolution to continue it, and to recom∣mend it to his Majesty for his Acceptance. But I refer to the Speech it self, as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P>My Lords,</P>
<P><HI>THE Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>in Parliament assembled, under the present Happiness they enjoy by His Majesty's peaceable and quiet Accession to the Throne, could not enter upon any Work more satisfactory and pleasing to themselves, than the providing a sufficient Revenue for the Occasi∣ons of His Majesty's Civil Government, in order to make His Reign as easie and prosperous, as the Begin∣ning of it hath been secure and undisturb'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They are sensible, that the Peace of the Kingdom is not to be preserv'd, nor the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects to be protected, without supporting the just Au∣thority and Dignity of the Crown; and therefore they have thought it their Interest, as well as Duty, to make such a Provision as may not barely suffice to the Necessity of the Government, but may be suitable to the State, the Honour, and the Luster which the Crown of</HI> Great Britain <HI>ought to be attended with.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whatsoever is superfluous in that Provision, and more than the ordinary Services of His Majesty shall require, will but enable Him to exert His highest and most va∣luable Prerogative of doing Good; And we can give no greater Proof of the Trust we repose in His Majesty's gracious Disposition, than putting the same entire Revenue into His Hands, which Her late Majesty died possess'd of; whose Virtues we all admir'd, and of whose Affection and Concern for the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of this Kingdom, we had had so long Experi∣ence.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
<HI>As the Crown it self descends immediately, and knows no Vacancy, the</HI> Commons <HI>have taken Care, that the Revenue should follow it as close as possible; for they have given all the Dispatch to this Grant which the Forms of their Proceedings would allow; So that when His Majesty shall please to answer the Impatient Desires of His People, by coming to take Possession of His Kingdoms, he will find Himself equally establish'd in these Revenues, as if he had succeeded to all by an uninterrupted Right of Inheritance: The only Difference is this, That if he had inherited them, he would have wanted one single Proof of the Duty, and Affection, and Unanimity of His Subjects.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our desire is, That this may be look'd upon as an Earnest and a Pledge of that Zeal and Fidelity which we shall always retain, and which, upon every Occa∣sion, we shall be ready to demonstrate to His Majesty's Person and Government: As such, we hope His Maje∣sty will graciously accept it at this Time; and here∣after, when He shall have had Experience of this first voluntary Offering of His Loyal</HI> Commons, <HI>we hope He will find it to His Satisfaction, as large and as ample as He could wish; might but the Term of the Grant be as long as we could wish; since it is to have equal Con∣tinuance with His Majesty's Life.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords,</P>
<P><HI>The Bill which the</HI> Commons <HI>have pass'd for the Purposes I have mention'd, is intituled,</HI> An Act for the better Support of His Majesty's Houshold, and of the Honour and Dignity of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They have also prepar'd another Bill, as well</HI> for rectifying Mistakes in the Names of the Commis∣sioners for the Land-Tax, as for raising so much as is wanting to make up the Sum of Fourteen
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
Hundred Thousand Pounds, intended to be raised by a Lottery, for the publick Service in the Year 1724. <HI>This having been recommended to their Care, and appearing to them to be necessary for His Majesty's and the</HI> publick Service, <HI>they have Reason to think they have now abundantly supply'd the Defects in the former Provision; and in this Assurance, they humbly present this Bill also for the Royal Assent.</HI></P>
<P>I add here, and to confirm the Character of this Parliament, the Acknowledgment return'd by the Regents to the Parliament for all this which was given in the King's Name; when the Bills being Presented and Sign'd, the Houses were Adjourn'd to the 25th.</P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>WE cannot but express our greatest Satisfaction, and, in His Majesty's Name, return you Thanks, for the convincing Proofs which you have given, in this Session, of your Duty and Affection to His Majesty, and of your Zeal for His Government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We must particularly thank you,</HI> Gentlemen of the House of Commons, <HI>for the Aids which you have granted to His Majesty, for the better Support of the Honour of the Crown, and for preventing any Disappointment in the Supplies given in the last Session for the Service of this Year. You may be assur'd, that the Unanimity, the Cheerfulness, and the Dispatch with which you have proceeded in granting these Aids, will render them yet more acceptable to His Majesty. And you may depend upon our making a faithful Representation thereof to Him.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><PB N="27" REF="28"/>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>All necessary Business being now happily concluded, it will be proper for us to put a speedy End to this Session. We think fit, at present, in His Majesty's Name, to desire you forthwith respectively to Ad∣journ your selves until</HI> Wednesday <HI>next.</HI></P></Q>
<P>At the Return of the House, the King's An∣swer to the Addresses above-mention'd, was pre∣sented to the Houses by the Secretary of State, and then the Houses were Prorogu'd to the 23d of <HI>September,</HI> and in a Word, never sat more.</P>
<P>The Reasons the King had for Dissolving this Loyal <HI>House of Commons,</HI> which had given such Testimonies of their Zeal for the Interest, and Person of the King, were variously spoken of; some reflecting on the House, some on other People: What I shall mention on this Account is, in short, this only, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. Whether the Reflections on the House, are just, or no? The past Account of their Proceedings, and of His Majesty's Re∣turn of Thanks to them, for their Loyalty, Zeal, and Affection, is a full and sufficient Answer. And 2. As to other Reflections, That Power, who only has, and ought to have a Right to Call, and Dissolve, without being accountable to any for so doing, did Dissolve them; and it is to be suppos'd might have Reasons for so doing, which it is none of my Business to enquire into.</P>
<P>I have been longer in this particular Trans∣action, than the Compass of this Work will al∣low in any other Session of Parliament, because of the remarkable Circumstances mention'd above; which as we shall meet with no more, so I shall make amends for this Excursion, in the Brevity of the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29"/>
The Regents having thus carry'd on their Busi∣ness, through the short Session of Parliament with Success; the Government began to settle, and e∣very thing went on smooth, and easy: The People were indeed a little Tumultuous, but it was at first rather on the Side of the Government, than against it. For not a Hand stirr'd, or offer'd to lift it self up against the Succession, or against the Administration. The Rabbles which were at all disturbing, were from some hot People who were willing to have shewn their Resentment at the Ministry of the late Reign their own Way, and those were not a little ex∣cited and stirr'd up to Disorder by the scurillous Li∣bels and Pamphlets publish'd at that time, reflecting upon the whole Proceedings of the Ministry, and Friends of the latter End of the late Reign, as one united, concerted Plot and Conspiracy against the Protestant Succession, and the Person of King GEORGE.</P>
<P>It is enough to mention these things as Matter of History, it is not my Business to debate with them, or about the Justice or Injustice of them. The first Evidence of the Truth of this, was in the Person of Mons. <HI>D' Ibberville,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Resident here, who found himself oblig'd to apply himself to the Lords of the <HI>Regency,</HI> to protect him from the Insults of the Rabble; which they readi∣ly granted, ordering a Detachment of the Guards to do Duty at his House, for that Pur∣pose; and the said Mons. <HI>D' Ibberville,</HI> in return, assur'd the <HI>Regency,</HI> that <HI>his Master would give no Disturbance to the Establishment of His Majesty on the Throne: But would inviolably maintain the Ar∣ticles of the Treaty of</HI> Utrecht, <HI>which related to the Settlement of the Crown on the Illustrious House of</HI> Hanover. It was suggested, maliciously enough, by some, that Mons. <HI>D' Ibberville,</HI> did this with∣out
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
Orders, and even before he had receiv'd any Answer from <HI>France</HI> to the Account he had trans∣mitted thither of Her late Majesty's Death. But they who insinuated this spoke without Book; Mons. <HI>D' Ibberville</HI> having receiv'd an Express from <HI>France</HI> the Evening before, and they must under∣stand very little of the Duty of a publick Minister, or how punctually the King of <HI>France</HI> is serv'd on all Occasions, or have a very mean and unworthy Opinion of Mons. <HI>D' Ibberville,</HI> to suppose he would have made such a Declaration, in the Name of his Master, without particular Orders so to do: But this Reproach was immediately taken off from his Excellency by two concurring Testimo∣nies to the same Purpose; 1. That the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> who arriv'd in <HI>England</HI> the next Day, <HI>viz.</HI> the 7th of <HI>August,</HI> assur'd the <HI>Regency,</HI> that being at the <HI>French</HI> Court when the News of the Queens Death came thither, by Express from Mons. <HI>D' Ibberville,</HI> the King of <HI>France</HI> had sent for his Lordship, and had assur'd him of the same, from his own Mouth, and in the very same Words, or to the same Purpose, that Mons. <HI>D' Ibberville</HI> had done. 2. That Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> then the <HI>British</HI> Resident at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> having notified the Death of the Queen to the <HI>French</HI> Court, had signified to the Lords of the <HI>Regency,</HI> that he had receiv'd Assurances in the like Terms from the King's own Mouth.</P>
<P>Besides all this, the Lords of the <HI>Regency,</HI> receiv'd a few Days after, a Letter from the <HI>French</HI> Court, Sign'd by his most Christian Majesty's own Hand to the same Purpose; importing farther, that the Elector of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> having some time before the Queen's Death, signify'd to his most Christian Majesty, that when ever his Succession should take place, he
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
would Cultivate a Friendship with his said Ma∣jesty; His said Majesty, on his part, assur'd the Lords of the <HI>Regency,</HI> that he would do all that lay in his Power, to maintain a good Intelligence and Amity between the two Crowns, and to pre∣serve the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> in all its Parts, and particularly in that part of it which related to the Renunciations, which he resolv'd to suffer no Al∣terations in, and that he had signify'd the same already to his Grandson King <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P>As these things concurr'd to make the King's Affairs easie Abroad, the Necessity of the King's speedy coming over was not so great, as to hin∣der His Majesty from dispatching all such other Affairs in His <HI>German</HI> Dominions, as requir'd his stay. And this, no Question, the Lords of the <HI>Regency</HI> meant, in the Expressions to the Par∣liament, in the Speech mention'd above, which relates to this, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>“We are assur'd, that if this, <HI>(viz.</HI> the Peace and Safety of his Dominions) had requir'd his more immediate Presence, he would, without the least Delay, have repair'd hither, for the Support of so dutiful and faith∣ful Subjects.”</Q> But all was quiet at Home, and clear Abroad, not a Hand mov'd, or Tongue spoke against the Succession of King GEORGE, either at Home, or Abroad: and his Majesty, except for the Appearance, might with the same Safety have come over, as an ordinary Passenger in the Pac∣quet-Boat, as with a Squadron of Men of War.</P>
<P>However, that His Majesty might have all things ready for His Voyage, when His Foreign Affairs were settled, and might have it in his Power to Embark when he pleas'd, and to Sail as His Occasions requir'd, Wind and Wea∣ther presenting. I say, For this Purpose, all the
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
Yachts were ordered to be got ready, with all pos∣ble speed, and a strong Squadron of Men of War, under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Berkley,</HI> was appointed for their Convoy, and such Expedition was used in this Equipment, that they arriv'd in <HI>Holland</HI> the 17th of <HI>August,</HI> and caus'd an Express to be sent to <HI>Hanover,</HI> to acquaint the King with his Arrival, and that he was there attending His Orders.</P>
<P>On Board the Yachts, were all the proper Officers of the Green-Cloth, whose Business it is to appoint the Kitchin, the Table, the Furniture, and Lodgings for the Royal House; and they had with them, all necessary Officers, and Provi∣sions accordingly, for the Use of the King and His Retinue.</P>
<P>While this was doing, the Lords of the <HI>Regency</HI> had before them, the ordinary Business of the Administration, which was all in perfect Order, nor did any thing uncommon, or difficult, or un∣usual occur to them; except such things as related to the placing or displacing some particular Men, in which they acted neither one way or other, but as they receiv'd positive Directions from the King: As to what was Extraordinary, the principal Thing before them, was the Funeral of Her late Majesty, and the Mourning on that Occasion.</P>
<P>Her Majesty Died on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 1st of <HI>August,</HI> in the Morning, as has been observ'd; on the <HI>Tuesday</HI> after, Her Body was open'd, and by the Re∣port of the Surgeons, all the Vitals, the Bowels, and Stomach, were exceeding sound and firm, and nothing was to be found there, which had any Symptoms of Disease; so that it was suppos'd the Cause of Her Death was to have been found in the Head, which Her Majesty having expresly
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
forbid to be open'd, the Surgeons ceas'd any far∣ther Enquiry: The Body was Embalm'd, and the Bowels buried the next Night, in the Royal Repository at <HI>Westminster.</HI> On <HI>Thursday</HI> the <HI>Earl Marshal</HI> publish'd an Order for a General Mourn∣ing, as usual in such Cases.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Lords waited the King's Orders, for the Interment, which arriv'd soon af∣ter; Importing, that the Body should be Interr'd with all Decency and Magnificence, such as, how∣ever, was to consist with the Form of a pri∣vate Funeral; which was accordingly done the 24th of <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>It was intended to have buried Her Majesty the 22d, nor could I ever be inform'd of the true Reason why it was put off, and appointed the 24th, unless I should be so uncharitable as to judge, as some have said, that it was on Purpose so contriv'd, by designing Men, that the Funeral might be attended with all the unhapy Circum∣stances of that Day, which has been esteem'd among those we call <HI>Dies Infaustaus,</HI> being the Day of the Massacre of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Day of the turning out the Dissenters from the Benefices they Injoy'd in the Church; which turning out they are pleas'd to call Persecution, and on that account to stile the Day, by the Name of <HI>Black Bartholomew.</HI> Nor should I have mention'd this, had it not been taken notice of by themselves, and the Memory of the Queen insulted on that very Account in a pub∣lick and detestable manner.</P>
<P>This Book being a History of the Reign of King GEORGE, allows not an Entrance into the Person and Character of the Queen, which must carry us back to things beyond the Beginning of our Work. But another Reason of
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
more Moment obliges me to leave that subject, <HI>viz.</HI> That I am inform'd it is doing at this Time by a Pen so much abler to do Her Majesty's Memory Justice, upon the scandalous Abuses of Her Cha∣racter and Conduct, and so much better acquain∣ted with the particular Circumstances of Her Reign, than those, who with Ignorance, equal to their Malice, have insulted and reproach'd Her; I think it therefore much better to omit any farther Enrance upon that Subject, except only this, that the Treatment Her Majesty's Memory has re∣ceiv'd from some People in this Reign, as well in Print, as otherwise, has not only been unjust and unworthy, but inimitably Rude; and such, as I believe, no Age can shew us the like in History: When at the same time, Malice it self cannot de∣ny Her Majesty to have been a Princess of spotless Vertue, fill'd with Charity and Clemency; of an universal Benignity and Goodness; of exemplary Piety, Tenderness, and Affection, for the Good, Peace, and Prosperity of Her People, unpara∣lell'd, and inimitable.</P>
<P>But I leave the ungrateful Subject, such a Queen so treated, obliges me indeed to call it so: I leave it, I say, and shall conclude all that relates to Her Majesty, in the following Account of Her Funeral.</P>
<P>Her Majesty's Body being thus Deposited, and the Counterfeit Mourning of many put on, the Hypocrisy of which they were not asham'd to ac∣knowledge; which, indeed, is my Authority for
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
into the <HI>Palace-Yard,</HI> and thence to the South-East Door of the Abby, one of the great Guns at the Tower firing every Minute, until Her Majesty was interr'd. The Royal Corps was born under a Canopy of Purple Velvet, preceded by a great Number of Her Servants, the Judges, Privy-Councellors, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the great Officers. The Pall was supported by Six Dukes. Her Grace the Dutchess of <HI>Or∣mond,</HI> (in the Absence of the Dutchess of <HI>Somer∣set,</HI> who was indispos'd) was chief Mourner, sup∣ported by the Dukes of <HI>Somerset</HI> and <HI>Richmond</HI> in long Cloaks, wearing their Collars of the Or∣der, her Train born by Two Dutchesses, assisted by the Vice-Chamberlain, and follow'd by Two other Dutchesses, at the Head of Fourteen Coun∣tesses as Assistants, all in long Veils of black Crape; and after them the Ladies of the Bed-Chamber, and the Maids of Honour in like Veils; then the Bed-Chamber Women, and the Gentlemen Pensioners, closed the Proceedings. At the Enterance into the Church, the Dean, Prebends and Choir re∣ceiv'd the Royal Body with an Anthem, and marching before <HI>Norroy,</HI> King of Arms, who car∣ried the Crown and Cushion, they proceeded singing to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh's Chappel; where being arriv'd, the Body was deposited on Tressels, while the Service of the Church was perform'd by the Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> Dean of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and afterwards interr'd in the same Vault, with King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, King <HI>William,</HI> Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>Her Majesty's Body being thus Deposited, and the Counterfeit Mourning of many put on, the Hypocrisy of which they were not asham'd to ac∣knowledge; which, indeed, is my Authority for
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
making such mention of it. The Lords of the <HI>Re∣gency</HI> continu'd their necessary Care of the Admini∣stration, but waiting, <HI>as the Nation did also most im∣patiently,</HI> the King's Arrival, They acted nothing more than Duty and Necessity oblig'd them to, except what they receiv'd immediate and express Orders for from the King.</P>
<P>However, in Execution of those Orders some∣thing Extraordinary was then necessary, as parti∣cularly, a Patent was order'd to pass the Seals for Creating the Electoral Prince, the King's eldest and only Son, Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> this was accord∣ingly prepared, and brought through all the ne∣cessary Steps, except Sealing with the Great Seal, which was, it seems, reserv'd for an Ho∣nour to the new Chancellor, which was to be, and as will be seen in its Place.</P>
<P>Also, at the same time, came over an Order to re∣move the Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> from his Office of Secre∣tary of State, which was done with this Addition, as the Prelude to that noble Person's Misfortunes, <HI>viz.</HI> That by Order of the Lords of the <HI>Regen∣cy</HI> his Lordship's Papers were Seized, and his Office Sealed up. However, his Lordship receiv'd these Marks of the King's Displeasure with a becoming Decency, and even his Enemies do not charge him with Missbehaviour upon the Occasion. The Persons sent to him to demand the Seals from his Lordship, were the Dukes of <HI>Shrowsbury</HI> and <HI>Somerset,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cowper,</HI> since made Chancellor; all the three <HI>which is something remarkable,</HI> having in a little time lain under the same Circumstances of being remov'd from all publick Employment, and afforded us Occa∣sion to mention them in this History on that Account.</P>
<P>The remaining Part of the time of this <HI>Regency</HI> af∣fords us more Matter of History from Abroad, than

at Home, the King having been thus Pro∣claim'd, and Establish'd on the Throne at Home had new Negotiations to set on Foot, and new Interests to cultivate Abroad, for the Secnrity of his Affairs, as King, and for the making proper Alliances, as King of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And these took up much time.</P>
<P>The first thing the King Ordered was a publick Thanksgiving, or <HI>Te Deum</HI> to be Sung after the manner of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Church, through all his forreign Dominions, for his Accession to the Throne. The next was to subjoyn Prayers to be made at the same time for his peaceable and prosperous Reign. After this follow'd the Congratulations of his own Subjects, the Nobility, and Persons of Quality who throng'd to <HI>Herenhausen,</HI> the King's Country Seat or Palace, where there was a very numerous Court, to felicitate his Majesty, and Kiss his Hand.</P>
<P>From these Ceremonies of the Court, they pro∣ceeded to those of the State, <HI>viz.</HI> To notify the King's Accession to the Crown, to all the Courts, Princes, and States of <HI>Europe,</HI> which was done as well by the Lords of the <HI>Regency,</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> in his Majesty's Name to some, as from the King himself to others; the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> notify'd it by Order of the <HI>Regency</HI> to the States-General, and to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and both were receiv'd as pub∣lick Ministers of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at the respective Courts where they reside. Espe∣cially the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> who was Ambassa∣dor and Plenipotentiary, and was continued in the same Post, by his Majesty's special Com∣mand from <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38"/>
Between the King and the States-General, as well directly, as by the Hands of the said Earl of <HI>Scrafford,</HI> there pass'd several Civilities, tending to the Planting and Cultivating an indissoluble Friendship between His Majesty and that State. And the States-General in Compliment to His Majesty, ordered eight Men of War to attend and join the <HI>British</HI> Squadron for His Convoy, and by a Letter on purpose, solemnly Invited the King to pass through their Country in His Way to <HI>England.</HI> In Answer to which the King himself wrote them the following Letter, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>The Princes and States to whom the King no∣tify'd his Accession to the Crown, more immedi∣ately from himself, were, first, The King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> then the Emperor, and afterwards the several other Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> including the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the like. And now His Majesty prepared to leave His Domini∣ons in <HI>Germany,</HI> where he Establish'd a Council of Twelve, with Orders to have some of their Body always in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to receive Instructions, and expedite the Dispatches necessary for the Administration of their Affairs.</P>
<P>In return to the Notices of this great Affair, the Court of <HI>Hanover</HI> was immediately throng'd with Princes, Envoys of Princes, Deputies, Persons of the first Rank for Royalty, and Nobility, who came to take part in the Joy of the Court, Con∣gratulate, and take Leave of the King. The Concourse was so great, that the King was oblig'd to put off His Departure for some Days, even when all things else were ready.

<P>On the last of <HI>August</HI> Old Stile, the King be∣gan his Journey, with the Prince his Son, and lay that Night at <HI>Doepenau,</HI> the next Day through <HI>Osnaburgh</HI> to <HI>Ippenburgh,</HI> on the 2d of <HI>September</HI> to <HI>Twickell,</HI> where they were Entertain'd by Count <HI>d' Opdam;</HI> and on the 3d to <HI>Voorst,</HI> a Town and
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
County belonging to the Earl of <HI>Albemarle;</HI> On the 4th, He was received by the Deputies of the States-General, appointed to Compliment Him upon their Frontiers, and that same Night the King enter'd the said Territories of the States-General, and went on to <HI>Utrecht;</HI> where they only staid to receive the Compliment of the States of that Province, and going on Board a Yacht appointed by the States to receive them, reached as far as <HI>Woorden</HI> that Night: Here His Majesty was again received by the Earl of <HI>Albe∣marle,</HI> and the Deputies of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and was Saluted with 54 Pieces of Cannon, being as many as he was Years Old.</P>
<P>On the 5th the King went into the Earl of <HI>Al∣bemarle</HI>'s Coach, His Attendants following in other Coaches, and a Detachment of the Horse Guards appointed to attend Him to <HI>Ley∣den,</HI> where he was again Saluted with 54 Guns, and making no Stay there, arriv'd at 5 a Clock at Night at the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>Here he was attended by a solemn Deputation from the States-General, to welcome His Majesty and the Prince into their Country, and His Court was throng'd with the <HI>British</HI> Nobility and Gentry, who had crowded over thither upon the Occasion; and here his Majesty held a very great and magnificent Court; here His Majesty was waited on by, and gave Audience to all the Foreign Ambassadors: Such as the Duke <HI>d' Ossuna,</HI> Ambassador of <HI>Spain;</HI> the Marquis <HI>de Chateau∣neuf,</HI> Ambassador of <HI>France;</HI> the Count <HI>de Tarouca,</HI> Ambassador of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and others.</P>
<P>In the Middle of these Ceremonies, several Matters of State were concerted by His Majesty's Direction, with the States General. And News
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
of the grand Affair of the Peace being concluded between <HI>France</HI> and the Emperor, at <HI>Baden,</HI> Crown'd the Assembly.</P>
<P>The King continu'd at the <HI>Hague</HI> till the 16th of <HI>September</HI> Old Stile, when the Wind presenting fair, the whole Retinue embark'd, the King went on Board the <HI>Peregrine</HI> Yacht, Capt. <HI>Saunderson</HI> Commander; the Prince in the <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> and having a very fair Wind, they Weighed imme∣diately, and Stood out to Sea, the Squadron of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, 15 in all, joyning them at the Mouth of the <HI>Mase;</HI> they were but one Night at Sea, for in the Morning early, the Men of War came into the Mouth of the <HI>Thames,</HI> in Sight of <HI>Margat;</HI> and as the Weather was exceed∣ing Pleasant, the Sea smooth, and the Wind fair, the King order'd the Yachts to go on, declining to go on Shore: That same Evening, the Yachts with the King reach'd to the <HI>Hope,</HI> below <HI>Gravesend,</HI> where the Men of War came to an Anchor. And it being a thick Fog, the King lay on Board all Night; the next Day, about Noon, the Yachts weighed, and came up as high as <HI>Long-reach,</HI> where Night coming on, the King and Prince went into their Barges, and came to <HI>Greenwich</HI> that Evening, where they Landed about six a Clock, having been met by an infinite Throng of People, in Boats upon the River, even quite as low as <HI>Gravesend,</HI> encreasing still, as they came nearer the Town, and by a Prodigious Crow'd on Shore; who, it being too Dark to distinguish the King, were greatly disappointed.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of the meeting, and Reception of the King, and the Acclamations of the People, being always such, on such Occasions, must be past over here; they are too long to give a parti∣cular
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
Account of, in this Work, nor are they Es∣sential to our Business. But some Account of this two Nights Court at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> is absolutely necessary to the Story in Hand, for here, and in this short time, are said to begin all those Steps which have been, if some say true, the main Spring and Occasion of all the Mischiefs which happen'd since.</P>
<P>The Moment His Majesty set his Foot on Shore upon <HI>English</HI> Ground, the Commission of the <HI>Regency</HI> Dissolv'd of Course, and the Executive Power no longer to be exercis'd by Deputation, revolv'd immediately upon His Majesty's own Hands.</P>
<P>This had been long'd for many Days, and it may be truly said, that the Nation in General wish'd earnestly for the King's Coming; not that the <HI>Regency</HI> acted out of their Duty. But it could be no Reproach to them, to say that it was not doubted, but, that when the King came to take the Administration into His own Hands, it would be better, and that their Management might be called indifferent compared to those Shoulders on which, fitted by Nature, the Load of Govern∣ment was appointed to be laid: In which Case one said at that time.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Great</HI> GEORGE, <HI>what Weights must on thy Shoulders lye,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which Six and Twenty Kings so ill Supply?</HI></L></Q>
<P>The Particulars of the King's Reception in foreign Parts, as he pass'd to the Sea Side to Embark, the Speeches and Compliments made to him at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and in other Places, before he arriv'd there, are too many and too remote from
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
the Design of this Work also to be plac'd here; be∣ing sufficiently touch'd at already, I come at once to the King's more immediate Administration.</P>
<P>The Evening that the King Arriv'd, no Busi∣ness was done, the King being fateigu'd, if I may call it so, with Ceremony, as well as with the Voyage, Dismiss'd the Court early, and retired into His Apartments; some indeed were admit∣ted there, but they were only such select Persons, who it was apparent shar'd of His Majesty's particular Favour and Confidence.</P>
<P>The first Act of Government the King exerted, at least which was publick, was a Message sent by the Lord <HI>Townshend</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> to this Purpose, <HI>viz. That the King had no longer Occasion for his Service, in the Quality of Captain General of the Army;</HI> it is said, that it was further added, to shew some Respect, that however, <HI>the King would be glad to see him at Court.</HI> But how true that may be, I do not affirm.</P>
<P>It is not much doubted, but as this Step was taken the first Night of the King's Arrival, so the whole Scheme of the new Ministry was settled there also, the next Day; seeing it was easy to discover, the next Morning, when the King shew'd himself in the Apartments, who were IN, tho' not so evidently who were OUT.</P>
<P>About 10 a Clock the King came out of His Bed-Chamber, and appear'd in open Court, which was at that time, promiscuously throng'd with the Nobility, and Gentry, of every Denomina∣tion; who had, without Exception, the Honour to Kiss His Majesty's Hand. Yet, as above, though all were admitted, it was no hard thing to distinguish who had the Honour to be more immediately acceptable.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45"/>
It was even there also known, tho' not parti∣cularly declar'd, that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was to have the Battoon, or Command of the Army; that Mr. <HI>W—</HI>would be at the Head of the Treasury; that the Lord <HI>Townshend</HI> would have the Seals of Office, as Secretary of State; and also, that the Lord <HI>Cowper</HI> would be made Lord Chan∣cellor: The Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who had now recon∣cil'd himself with the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> ap∣pear'd next to the Prince, as the other did next the King.</P>
<P>In this manner Things went those two Nights, when all Matters seem'd to receive some Interrup∣tion by the necessary Dispositions which were to be made for the Royal Entry, or the Cavalcade through the City, which was appointed for <HI>Mon∣day</HI> the 20th of <HI>September.</HI> The Earl Marshal was consulted, for the Order of this Entry, and Di∣rections given him to issue out his Orders for the Precedency, and manner of the Procession, which was accordingly done. And is as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>WHERE AS the Solemnity of the King's Roy∣al Entry from</HI> Greenwich, <HI>through the City of</HI> London, <HI>to His</HI> Royal Palace <HI>of</HI> St. James<HI>'s, is appointed to be on</HI> Monday <HI>the 20th of this Instant</HI> September,; <HI>This is therefore to give Notice to all the Nobility, and others, who are to attend the King in their Coaches, that they repair to</HI> Greenwich Park, <HI>so as to be there by Ten of the Clock that Morn∣ing at farthest; where their Coaches will be put in Order by the Officers of Arms appointed for that Purpose.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And that the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, Recorder, and Sheriffs of</HI> London, <HI>with such as have serv'd or fin'd for Aldermen or Sheriffs of the said City; the City</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
<HI>Officers, and the Detachment of the</HI> Artillery-Com∣pany; <HI>as also the Knight Marshal's Men, the King's Kettle Drums and Trumpets, the King's Heralds, and Serjeant at Armes, the Gentleman-Usher of the black Rod, and the Officers and Yeomen of His Maje∣shy's Guards,</HI> amp;c. <HI>do meet in</HI> Southwark, <HI>about Twelve of the Clock, and extend themselves in the Order they are to March from the Foot of</HI> London-Bridge <HI>to</HI> St. Margaret's-Hill, <HI>and there wait His Majesty's Arrival; and so soon as Notice is given that the Coaches are coming into</HI> Kent-Street, <HI>they are all to be marshalled in their due Order by the Officers of Arms.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Accordingly on the 20th of <HI>September,</HI> the King made His Entry through the City, with the usual Form, and with all the Tokens of a most joyful Reception; the Particulars of the Ceremony are too tedious for this Work, in which I hasten to things of the greatest Consequence.</P>
<P>The next Morning, there was a numerous Throng of the Nobility and Gentry, to pay their Compliments, and to Kiss the King's Hand, as also the Ministers of <HI>France, Sicily, Prussia, Po∣land, Portugal,</HI> and others; the same Day in the Evening the Privy-Council assembled, where His Majesty appear'd, and took the Oath, and sub∣scrib'd the Instrument of Security relating to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as requir'd by Law, the Lord's of the Council present, Signing the same as Witnesses; there were Duplicates of the Instru∣ment sign'd, one whereof was entered in the Books of the Council, and lodg'd in the Records here, and the other sent down to be preserv'd in the publick Register in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to be enter'd in the Books of the Court of Session there, which is,
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
what they call their College of Justice. After this, the King made the following Declaration to the Council, and in a full Meeting. And the Lords, in Return, requested that it might be made pub∣lick, which was order'd accordingly. And is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>HAving in my Answers to the Addresses of both Houses of Parliament, fully express'd my Reso∣lution to defend the Religious and Civil Rights of all My Subjects, there remains very little for me to say up∣on this Occasion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yet being willing to omit no Opportunity of giving all possible Assurances to a People, who have already deserved so well of Me; I take this Occasion also, to express to you my firm Purpose to do all that is in My Power, for the Supporting and Maintaining the Churches of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Scotland, <HI>as they are severally by Law Establish'd; which, I am of Opini∣on, may be effectually done, without the least im∣pairing the Toleration, allowed by Law to</HI> Protestant Dissenters, <HI>so agreeable to</HI> Christian <HI>Charity, and so necessary to the Trade and Riches of this King∣dom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The good Effects of making Property secure are no where so clearly seen, and to so great a Degree, as in this Happy Kingdom; and I assure you, That there is not any among you, shall more earnestly Endeavour the Preservation of it than My self.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The same time, the King nam'd several new Privy-Councellors, as first the Prince, who was introduc'd in Particular, and took his Place on the Right Hand, next to the King, after which, the Arch-Bishop of <HI>York,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> were Nam'd by the King, and
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
were immediately Sworn, and took their Places at the Board.</P>
<P>Then the King declar'd the Lord Viscount <HI>Townshend,</HI> Secretary of State; the Earl of <HI>Notting∣ham,</HI> Lord President of the Council; the Earl of <HI>Wharton,</HI> Lord Privy-Seale; the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cowper,</HI> Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Addresses now began to croud in from all Parts, to Congratulate the King's Accession, as is Natu∣ral on such Occasions, and in Particular, the two Universities, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and par∣ticularly the Clergy of <HI>London;</HI> these led the Way. It would be endless to give the Detail of the Places from whence, much less the Petitions themselves, nor is it at all necessary, they being generally things something a-like in their Manner, as they are in their End.</P>
<P>One of the first things of Moment, which oc∣cur'd in the Sphere of the New Lord Chancellor, and the first Patent which past the Great Seal in this Reign, was that of Creating the King's eldest and only Son, Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> This was order'd soon after his Lordship had the Seals, and was declar'd in Council, his Name and Titles run thus, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>GEORGE AUGUSTUS, (Prince of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> Electoral Prince of <HI>Brunswick Lunenburgh,</HI> Duke of <HI>Cornwal</HI> and <HI>Rothsaye,</HI> Duke and Marquiss of <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> Earl of <HI>Milford-Haven</HI> and of <HI>Carrick,</HI> Vis∣count <HI>North-Allerton,</HI> Baron of <HI>Tewkesbury</HI> and of <HI>Renfrew,</HI> Lord of the <HI>Isles,</HI> and Steward of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter) Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Chester.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49"/>
The Preamble of this Patent is upon that Ac∣count worth Recording, and is, as it was then publish'd, in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Which in <HI>English</HI> runs thus:</P>
<P><Q>“IT being incumbent on Us, not only to pro∣cure the present Good of the Kingdoms, to the Government whereof it has pleased God to call Us, but also to provide for their future Se∣curity; our first and principal Care was, to re∣commend as much as possible, our only Son, <HI>George Augustus,</HI> to the Affection of our People, whom he is one Day to Govern: Our Will is therefore, that he be Honoured with the Titles peculiar to the Eldest Son of the King of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> to evince both our Paternal Affection to

<P>Much about the same time, farther Promo∣tions of great Officers were declar'd though it was true they were determin'd several Weeks before; as particularly, the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> was de∣clared Captain General of all the Land Forces, Colonel of the First Regiment of the Foot Guards, and Master General of the Ordnance.

<P>This Council met for the first Time, on the first of <HI>October,</HI> when some Alterations in <HI>Ireland</HI> were appointed, especially in the Judges; for Example, <HI>Allen Brodrick,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was made Lord Chancellor of <HI>Ireland; William Whitshed,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench; <HI>John Foster,</HI> ditto of the Com∣monpleas; <HI>John Dean,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer; And <HI>James Mackartney</HI> one of the Judges of the King's Bench.</P>

<P>The same Day, the King was pleas'd to Sign a Commission for Lieutenant General <HI>William Cadogan,</HI> to be Colonel of the Second Regiment of Foot-Guards, in the Room of General <HI>Church∣hill.</HI></P>
<P>On the 16th of <HI>October</HI> was held at St. <HI>James</HI>'s a Chapter of the most noble Order of the Garter, where the King, and several of the Knights Com∣panions being present, <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Boulton; John</HI> Duke of <HI>Rutland; L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onel Cranfield,</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI> and <HI>Middlesex;</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> Earl of <HI>Halifax;</HI> were elected Knights Companions of the said Order, having been first introduc'd into the Chapter, and Knighted by the Sovereign, with the Sword of State; and then withdrawing, were afterwards, severally sent for in, (according to the Order above-mention'd) and invested with the Garter and <HI>George,</HI> with the usual Ceremo∣nies.</P>

<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
was Declar'd Master of the Robes to the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>On the 18th of <HI>October,</HI> Sir <HI>Michael Warton,</HI> who had been mention'd to be Created a Baron, having though with great Expressions of Duty and Gratitude to the King, declin'd that Ho∣nour, His Majesty was pleas'd to accept his Ex∣cuse.</P>
<P>At the same Time the King also appointed, <HI>Wil∣liam</HI> Lord <HI>Cowper,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to be Lord Lieutenant of the County of <HI>Hert∣ford; Hugh,</HI> Earl <HI>Cholmondeley,</HI> to be Governor of <HI>Chester;</HI> Lieutenant General <HI>William Sey∣mour,</HI> to be Lieutenant of the Band of Pensioners; the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Grafton,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Kent,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Dorset,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Berke∣ley,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Selkirk,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Stair,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Orrery,</HI> the Lord <HI>Carteret,</HI> to be Gen∣tlemen of the Bed-Chamber to His Majesty: And the Honourable Mr. <HI>Howard,</HI> Brigadier <HI>Dormer,</HI> Brigadier <HI>Breton,</HI> Colonel <HI>Kerr,</HI> Colonel <HI>Tyrrel,</HI> Colonel <HI>Fielding,</HI> Colonel <HI>Cornwal,</HI> to be Grooms of the Bed-Chamber. The King was likewise pleas'd to appoint the Earl of <HI>Stair</HI> to go to the Court of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>On the 20th the Coronation was perform'd with all the Pomp and Ceremony usual on such Occasions, the whole was very Magnificent, but was attended with some unhappy Accidents, <HI>viz.</HI> the fall of several Scaffolds <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Stages erected. for Spectators, by which, the Crowd being great, many were hurt, and some kill'd out∣right; the Scaffolds in the <HI>Palace-Yard</HI> fell, just as the Procession was coming by.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57"/>
By this time, the Dissatisfactions of the people began to discover themselves a little; the Methods which the Court had taken, and seem'd resolv'd to take, in the displacing one Side, and putting in the other, almost universally, could not but disoblige many; and the Coronation Day being celebrated all over the Nation, the Mobs and Tumuits which appear'd on that Occasion, were, as I may say, the Beginning of that Temper which afterwards spread it self almost over the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>Nor was the bare displacing the Old Ministry, and all the Friends of that Side, or the putting in the New Men, the main Spring the Peoples Dissatisfactions, so much as the Warmth of those People who pretended to be gratify'd in the Change; those were not content to be in Power, or to see their Friends wholly possess'd of the Royal Favour, and have Opportunity to xert the Power of the Government in the Interest of their Party; but they immediately turn'd upon those who they now look'd upon as under Foot, with bitter Reproaches, Taunts, Threatnings, and all manner of Triumph that could be thought of; or could indeed be practis'd, by a conquering Enemy, over a vanquish'd Prisoner; insul∣ing them with opprobious Language, unsuffer∣able to Men of Honour and Spirit, and threat∣ning them with the utmost Revenge and Resent∣ment.</P>
<P>Let no Man mistake this, to signify that either the King, or any of His Ministry did thus, or en∣courag'd the doing of this. His Majesty having fill'd up the great Employments of the Court, with M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n who he thought best capable to execute the Trust reposed in them, most deserving of, and
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
attacht to the Interest of himself, and the Royal Family, might well in the Infancy, or at least, the Youth of His Government, give them a Loose in their Conduct, to judge for him in many things what was fittest to be done, and whether Lenity or Severity were the most proper to begin the Schemes of the New Administration with, in respect to those who went before them.</P>
<P>Clearing therefore, entirely, the King and all His <HI>German</HI> Ministry of being any way the Occa∣sion of any Measures which might be taken to en∣courage the Passions of Men in Power, to carry on the Party Resentments mention'd above, and from which, many of the Misfortunes which fol∣lowed may be said to derive. Clearing, I say, the King, and His Friends, from the Charge en∣tirely, and leaving it undetermin'd, who of the New Ministry, were, or were not mistaken in their first Measures, I choose to speak of the Fer∣ment of Parties without Doors, from whence, as from a troubled Fountain, issued afterwards, Dis∣content, Faction, Rage, Tumult, Riot, Fight∣ing, Plundering, Demolishing Houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in a Word, all kind of Popular Distraction. At Court, this was follow'd with Flight of Discon∣tented Lords, Throanings, Impeachments, Im∣prisonments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till at length, altogether Issued in bidding Defiance to the Government. And Men of Dignity being made Desperate, sought Shelter very unhappily in Treason and Rebellion.</P>
<P>I might follow Truth too close at the Heels, as was said of a much better Historian, if I should Trace the Causes of all these things nearer than I have done in this brief Recapitulation of the first Movemente in this Reign. I return to the History in which the Relation it self will disco∣ver
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
without any farther Paraphrase, whether it be true or not, that all the future Distractions took their Rise as above.</P>
<P>The Coronation being over, Matters of Ceremony Ended, and the great Offices fill'd up, with Men of the highest Figure and Cha∣racter, on that Side, they began to enter upon the Administration. Frequent Councils were held upon the Measures in which, even in the Infancy of Things, they did not agree perfectly; there happen'd to be ONE Person plac'd at the Head of Business, who still retain'd true Principles of Go∣vernment; and who having by his extraordinary Genius, and long Experience in the Administration of Affairs under the like Agitation of Parties, in former Reigns, seen the mischievous Consequences of Arming the Parties one against another, feeding the Fire of Men's Passions on the one hand, or pushing Men to Desperations on the other; and being a Friend to moderate Councils, on every Hand, opposed himself though with Calmness, and powerful Reasonings, to the Heat of some other People, who were for carrying on the Govern∣ment upon the Basis of Justice, as they call'd it, to their Enemies.</P>
<P>When, I say, there was ONE Person of such noble and superior Principles, in this first Mini∣stry, I do not suggest that there was BUT ONE; but I may be allow'd to say, that I believe there was none stood so firm to the last, in his Judgment of the best Measures which were to be taken for the fixing and establishing the King in the Throne, and for preventing the evil Consequences which fol∣low'd.</P>
<P>He had, indeed, this Advantage above most Men of that time he liv'd in, <HI>viz.</HI> That his Zeal
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
and Sincerity was unquestion'd; his Understand∣ing and Capacities unexceptionable; and his Attachment to the Royal Family unsuspected; and above all, he was a Man who had never chang'd, which few in that Body of People, I am now speaking of, could say of themselves.</P>
<P>It was with some Warmth, that his proposals of a more moderate Proceeding were received, and the new Managers began not only to argue against it, with some Reflections upon things past; but let the Dispute take Vent among the Com∣mon People, with whom the Moderation of Pro∣ceedings in former Times, were run down with great Clamour; and even King <HI>William</HI>'s Prudent Conduct, was now call'd a criminal Lenity.</P>
<P>This Method of putting the Argument into the Mouths of the People, was indeed very Particu∣lar, and strongly intimated, that they were put to it, by the Opposition they met with, not∣withstanding the Majority in Number; and they had no better way to support their Opinion, than that of making it Popular: Having thus first cry'd out to the People, from within, as if they had bespoke then Clamour, The People tost the Ball back again to them, crying out to the Court, for Justice; and thus those moderate Things, were very unhappily over-rul'd in the Beginning; what the Consequences of these Measures were, History will discover.</P>
<P>I say no more of this, for these Reasons. 1. Because the excellent Person I mention'd, who was then over-rul'd, was soon after snatch'd a∣way by a lamented Death, before he saw his Op∣posers convinc'd, or come over to be of his O∣pinion. 2. Because the Warmest of them after∣wards
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
grew wiser, were convinc'd by their own Experience, having liv'd to see that the Measures they began with, when Circumstances came to discover them further, were not sopracticable, or so Capable of procuring the publick Tranquillity, as they expected; and some of them have, though late, alter'd their Conduct. But to return to the Relation of Fact.</P>
<P>Immediately after the Coronation, some fur∣ther Alterations in the Employment, of great Men, remain yet to be mentiond; which I name now because the whole Body of the New Court, might appear, before they might be said to en∣ter upon Actiount. These were, as follows,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Duke of <HI>Kent,</HI> was made Constable and Governor of <HI>Windsor</HI> Castle, and Keeper of the Park, and Forest of <HI>Windsor,</HI> in the Room of the Duke of <HI>Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Earl of <HI>Stairs,</HI> and <HI>Paul Methuen,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Sworn of the Privy-Council.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> made Chamber∣lain of the Houshold.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Dukes of <HI>Bolton, Rutland, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Argyle;</HI> with the Earls of <HI>Dorset,</HI> and <HI>Hali∣fax,</HI> were declar'd Knights of the Garter, and were install'd the 9th of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>The usual and needful Time, for the meeting and sitting of the Parliament, began now to advance; the Government was fully fix'd; the Administration was wholly now in the Hands of those who the King design'd to entrust it with; and the Common People began on several Oc∣casions, and in several Places to be very Tumul∣tuous and Uneasy, as has been mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62"/>
The Parliament in being, which had so effectu∣ally shewn their Zeal for His Majesty's Inte∣rest and Succession, in the Beginning of His Reign, and when, if ever, that Succession might be said to be capable of receiving any Attacks from any Person whatsoever, were adjourn'd from the 19th of <HI>November,</HI> to the 15th of <HI>January;</HI> and many People entertain'd Hopes that they would then Sit, at least for a while, that they might have had further Opportunities to have exerted themselves in the Service of His Majesty, and their Country; in which case, it was believ'd, the tumultuous Disposition of the People, might have receiv'd a Due, because an early Check; and the evil Con∣sequences which follow'd have been prevented, or at least things might, by the wise Dispositions of the Parliament between the Extreams on all Sides, been so moderated, as that the Reason and Occasions, or Pretences of those Discontents should have been remov'd.</P>
<P>But things took another Turn, and the Tem∣per of those People, mention'd before, seem'd not to desire Accommodations, but run all upon pun∣ishments of the Mismanagers in the preceding Reigns; upon Resentments, and Revenge; censur∣ing all those who recommended more moderat Measures, as Enemies to the House of <HI>Hanover;</HI> which furious Treatment stopt the Mouths of many, who were as sincere Friends to the Go∣vernment, as any of them were; but who yet were of Opinion, that it was not the true Interest of the Kingdom, to carry Matters on to such Extreams, as they found some Men had in View.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63"/>
But it was not a Time for such Men to give their Opinion, the Stream running, as I have ob∣serv'd, another Way. So a few Days after, it was apparent, a New Parliament was resolv'd on, and accordingly, on the 15th of <HI>January</HI> a Proclama∣tion was publish'd.</P>
<P>This Proclamation being very Extraordinary, for the Form, and great Exceptions being taken at some Expressions in it, as if it was unduly In∣termeddling with the Election it self, and direct∣ing the Electors what Persons they should choose, I cannot omit inserting here, because great Con∣tention follow'd among the Parties on both Sides, upon this Subject.</P>
<Q><P>GEORGE R.</P>
<P><HI>IT having pleased Almighty God, by most remark∣able Steps of his Providence, to bring Us in Safety to the Crown of this Kingdom, notwithstanding the De∣signs of evil Men, who shew'd themselves disaffected to Our Succession, and who have since, with the utmost Degree of Malice, misrepresented our firm Resolution, and uniform Endeavours to preserve and defend our most excellent Constitution, both in Church and State; and attemptted by many false Suggestions to render Us suspected to Our People; we cannot omit, on this Oc∣casion of first summoning Our Parliament of</HI> Great Bri∣tain, <HI>(in justice to Our Selves, and that the Miscarri∣ages of others may not be imputed to Us, at a Time when false Impressions may do the greatest and irrecove∣rable Hurt before they can be cleared up) to signify to Our whole Kingdom, That we were very much concern'd, on our Accession to the Crown, to find the publick Affairs of Our Kingdoms under the greatest Difficulties, as well in respect of Our Trade and the Interruption of our Na∣vigation,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
<HI>as of the great Debts of the Nation, which we were surpriz'd to observe, had been very much in∣creased since the Conclusion of the last War. We do not therefore doubt that if the ensuing Elections shall be made by our loving Subjects with that Safety and Freedom which by Law they are entitled to, and we are firmly resolv'd to maintain to them, they will send up to Parliament the fittest Persons to redress the pre∣sent Disorders, and to provide for the Peace and Hap∣piness of Our Kingdoms, and the Ease of Our People for the Future, and therein will have a particular re∣gard to such as shew'd a Firmness to the</HI> Protestant <HI>Succession, when it was most in danger: We have there∣fore found it necessary, as well for the Causes aforesaid, as for other weighty Considerations concerning Us and our Kingdoms, to call a new Parliament; and We do accordingly declare, That with the Advice of Our Privy-Council, We have this Day given Order to Our Chan∣cellor of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>to issue out Writs in due Form for the calling a new Parliament; which Writs are to bear</HI> Teste <HI>on</HI> Monday <HI>the 17th Day of this instant</HI> January, <HI>and to be returnable on</HI> Thursday <HI>the 17th Day of</HI> March <HI>next following.</HI></P>
<P>Given at our Court at <HI>St. James</HI>'s, the 15th Day of <HI>January,</HI> 1714, in the first Year of Our Reign.</P></Q>
<P>I do not lead my Readers to make their Judg∣ment of this Proclamation, one Way or other, by my Opinion, but telling them the Objecti∣on only, without any Explanations; leave them to make what Judgment their Reason dictates. Only adding, that the Pen was set to Work on both Sides in these Disputes, to the great disquieting and disturbing the Peace of the
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
Kingdom, and to an entire Breach of Charity, and good Manners, as to Persons; all which, ten∣ded still, to the farther ripeningup the Animosities of the Parties, and bringing them to the fatal Rupture, that follow'd soon after. But to return to the Affair of a New Parliament, which was now the main thing that Occupy'd the Parties.</P>
<P>It was at this Time, that a Pamphlet was pub∣lish'd, and dispers'd privately over most parts of the Kingdom, nay and of <HI>Ireland</HI> too, which gave great Offence to the Government, and in∣deed did a great deal of Damage to the Interest. It was call'd, <HI>English Advice to the Freeholders of</HI> Great Britain. The Contents of the Pamphlet it self, the Mischief it did, and the Concern the Go∣vernment was in to counter-act the Design of it, are as well to be seen in the Proclamation for sup∣pressing it, as if I were to give an Abstract of the Book it self. And therefore I think this Procla∣mation absolutely necessary to be recorded also, in this Place; as also, because it may give the Reader Occasion to form in his Mind just Ideas of the State of the Times, the Questions in Dis∣pute, and the Temper of both Parties in car∣rying them on.</P>
<Q><P>GEORGE R.</P>
<P><HI>WHereas We have received Information, that a most malicious and Traiterous Libel, intitled,</HI> English Advice to the Freeholders of <HI>England, has lately been printed and dispersed throughout our King∣doms with the utmost Industery; nevertheless, by the Care and Vigilance of Our Magistrates, great Numbers thereof are interrepted in Our City of</HI> Exon, <HI>some being directed to Sir</HI> John Coriton, <HI>Sir</HI> Nicholas Morice,

<HI>Author, Printer, or Publishers; and that they do ap∣prehend and seize the said Persons, and all others whom they shall find dispersing the said Libel, and give proper Information thereof, so as the said Offenders may be dealt with as the utmost Rigour of Justice requires.</HI></P>

<P>It was acknowledg'd, the Piece was Artfully written, and that one of the best Pens of that Par∣ty was Employ'd in it; and the Zeal of the Parties appear'd, in that not the Reward of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> for the Author, or 500 <HI>l.</HI> for the Printer, could ever tempt any of those who were Privy to it, as some of Necessity must be, to make the Discovery.</P>
<P>It is true, that during this whole Interval, that is to say, from the placing the new Ministry, to the meeting of this new Parliament, the King∣dom felt unsufferable Convulsions: The Ferments which the Parties were come to, the Animosities with which they oppos'd one another, the Riots, Tumults, Rage, and ill Conduct, was such, as nothing but a Hand of Power seem'd capable of Suppressing; and any Man, tho' of but small Pene∣tration, might perceive it would unavoidably come to Blows, and that no End could be put to it on both Sides without Blood.</P>
<P>It would take up more Room, not only than can be spar'd here, but even than this Book con∣tains, to give a true Account of all the Feuds, Disputes, Quarrels, Riots, Tumults, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Consequences of them which happen'd, from the celebrating the Joy of the Coronation-Day, for there the Rabbles began, to the meeting of this Parliament. But as they all ran like Rivers into
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
the great Ocean of War and Rebellion, I need enter no farther into the Detail of them, than just to mention, that at <HI>London, Bristol, Oxford, Man∣chester, Shrewsbury,</HI> and many Towns more, in <HI>Shropshire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, Lancashire,</HI> &amp;c. the Mobs were outragious, pull'd down Meeting-Houses, broke Windows, and Heads, and even at length came to Fire at one another with Mus∣quets and Pistols, whereby much Mischief was done, and several People kill'd, and more wound∣ed; but of these things, I shall find too much Occasion to speak again hereafter.</P>
<P>According to the Return of the Writs for Electi∣on, the Parliament was to meet the 17th of <HI>March,</HI> Previous to their Meeting, and in Conse∣quence of the Resolution mention'd of entring in∣to the Resentments of the former Reign, and ex∣amining the Conduct of the Ministry of Queen ANNE, several Steps were taken, which more and more alarm'd all those Gentlemen, who had been concern'd in those Affairs</P>
<P>The first more open Step to those things was, that on the 11th of <HI>January,</HI> the Lord <HI>Townshend,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> both at that time Secretaries of State, were sent by Order of Council, to the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> late Ambassador and Plenipotentiary at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> to Demand from him the Original Instructions, and Orders sent him upon the Publick Account, during his Mini∣stry Abroad; all Letters written by him, or to him, to, or from, any Person whatsoever, relating to the Negotiations from the time of his being first at the <HI>Hague.</HI> They were to be seal'd up with his Lordship's Seal upon Delivery, and to be seal'd with the Lord President's Seal, when brought to the Council, and so to remain till the Parliament
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
should meet, and give Orders about them. They brought away two Trunks which the Earl told them contain'd what they came for. But it being said, there were more on Board a Ship come from <HI>Holland,</HI> and not then landed, Orders were issu'd to demand them also; but I do not hear they were found.</P>
<P>The 20th of <HI>January</HI> was appointed for a Day of General Thanksgiving, for the peaceable Accessi∣on of the King to the Throne, and the King and whole Court came in Procession to St. <HI>Paul's</HI> upon that Occasion; <HI>Te Deum</HI> was sung to Musick within, and clos'd with Guns fired from the <HI>Tower</HI> without; the Sermon was Preach'd by the Bishop of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and at Night God was thank'd again, as is our usual Custom in <HI>England,</HI> with Bells, and Bonfires, Illuminations, shouting of Rabbles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>On the 17th of <HI>March</HI> the Parliament met, the King attended by the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> appear'd for the first Time, in the House of Peers, and the Commons being sent for up, were Order'd to re∣turn, and choose a Speaker, and to present him to the King. On the 21st, when they appear'd again, having chosen <HI>Spencer Compton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Speaker of their House, they Presented him to the King, with the usual Ceremony; when the King having approv'd the Speaker, open'd the Session, with the following Speech, which was read by the Lord Chancellor.</P>
<Q><P>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>THIS being the first Opportunity that I have had of meeting my People in Parliament, since it pleased God, of his good Providence, to call me to the Throne of my Ancestors, I most gladly make use</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
<HI>of it to thank my faithful and loving Subjects, for that Zeal and Firmness that hath been shewn in Defence of the</HI> Protestant <HI>Succession, against all the open and se∣cret Practices that have been used to defeat it: And I shall never forget the Obligations I have to those who have distinguish'd themselves upon this Occasion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It were to be wish'd, that the unparallell'd Successes of a War, which was so wisely and cheerfully supported by this Nation, in order to procure a good Peace, had been attended with a suitable Conclusion: But it is with Concern I must tell you, that some Conditions, even of this Peace, essential to the Security and Trade of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>are not yet duly executed; and the Performance of the whole may be look'd upon as precari∣ous, until we shall have formed defensive Alliances to Guaranty the present Treaties.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Pretender, <HI>who still resides in</HI> Lorrain, <HI>threa∣tens to disturb Us, and boasts of the Assistance, which he still expects here, to repair his former Disappoint∣ments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A great Part of our Trade is render'd impractica∣ble: This, if not retriev'd, must destroy Our Manufac∣tures, and ruin our Navigation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Publick Debts are very Great, and surprizingly encreased, even since the fatal Cessation of Arms. My first Care was to prevent the farther Increase of these Debts, by paying off forthwith a great Number of Ships, which had been kept in Pay, when there was no Occasion for continuing such an Expence.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I rely upon you for such Supplies as the present Cir∣cumstances of Our Affairs require for this Year's Ser∣vice, and for the Support of the Publick Faith. The Estimates shall be laid before you, that you may consider</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
<HI>of them; and what you shall judge necessary for your Safety, I shall think sufficient for mine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I doubt not but you will concur with me in Opinion, that nothing can contribute more to the Support of the Credit of the Nation, than a strict observance of all Parliamentary Engagements.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Branches of the Revenue, formerly granted for the Support of the Civil Government, are so far in∣cumber'd and alienated, that the Produce of the Funds which remain, and have been granted to me, will fall much short of what was at first design'd for maintaining the Honour and Dignity of the Crown: And since it is my Happiness (as I am confident you think it yours) to see a Prince of</HI> Wales, <HI>who may, in due Time, suc∣ceed me on the Throne, and to see him bless'd with ma∣ny Children, the best and most valuable Pledges of our Care and Concern for your Prosperity; this must Occa∣sion an Expence to which the Nation has not of many Years been accustom'd; but such as surely no Man will grudge: And therefore I do not doubt but you will think of it with that Affection which I have Reason to hope from you.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>The Eyes of all</HI> Europe <HI>are upon you, waiting the Issue of this first Session. Let no unhappy Divisions of Parties here at Home, divert you from pursuing the Common Interest of your Country. Let no wicked In∣sinuations disquiet the Minds of my Subjects. The establish'd Constitution in Church and State shall be the Rule of my Government; the Happiness, Ease, and Prosperity of my People, shall be the chief Care of my Life. Those who assist me in carrying on these Measures, I shall always esteem my best Friends; and I doubt not but that I shall be able, with your Assistance, to disappoint the Designs of those who would</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
<HI>deprive me of that Blessing, which I most Value,</HI> The Affection of my People.</P></Q>
<P>The Addresses, and Answers, usual on these Occasions, from, and to both Houses, are too long for this Place, nor at all needful, being per∣fectly customary, and much the same, as happen every Session, <HI>mutatis mutandis</HI> as Circumstances direct.</P>
<P>In the very first Speech made in this House of Commons, the Mismanagements of the former Reign were fallen upon by a Person who has since had Occasion to see farther into the Designs of Persons and the Conduct of Things, than at that Time his Passions would permit him to do; and the Wording their first Address introduc'd it into both Houses, where it soon became familiar; for the warm Party carry'd this Point in every De∣bate.</P>
<P>By this time also, the general Cry, without Doors as well as within, ran so much upon the late Mis∣managements, and the farther Inquiry into the Conduct of the late Reign, grew so Popular, and Consequently seem'd so Necessary, that it was easie to see who they aim'd at.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> late Secretary of State to the Queen, tho' he appear'd openly and spoke boldly, in the House of Lords, yet as he saw there would be no resisting a Torrent, and that the part he had in the Treaty, might very easily be carry'd into what Constructions those who had Numbers on their Side might direct, was advis'd by all his Friends, to keep himself out of their Hands, who, as if they were desirous he should Fly, openly profess'd to aim at his Head.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74"/>
He took their Advice accordingly, and with∣drew the 26th, having before secured a Vessel to meet him at <HI>Dover,</HI> and carry him over to <HI>France,</HI> where accordingly he Landed the same Evening. It was said, he left behind him, written with his own Hand, the following Letter, directed in no Name, but written to a Friend.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Dover,</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 27.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>“I Left the Town so abruptly, that I had no time to take Leave of you, or any of my Friends: You will Excuse me, when you know, That I had certain, and repeated Informations, from some who are in the Secret of Affairs, That a Resolution was taken, by those who have Power to execute it, to pursue me to the Scaffold. My Blood was to have been the Cement of a new Alliance; nor could my Innocence be any Security, after it had been once demanded from Abroad, and resolv'd on at Home, that it was necessary to cut me off. Had there been the least Reason to hope for a fair and open Trial, after having been already prejudg'd, un∣heard by the two Houses of Parliament, I should not have declin'd the strictest Examination. I challenge the most inveterate of my Enemies to produce any one Instance of criminal Correspon∣dence, or the least Corruption in any Part of the Administration, in which I was concern'd. If my Zeal for the Honour and Dignity of my Royal Mistress, and the true interest of my Country, has any where transported me to let slip a warm or unguarded Expression, I hope the most favourable Interpretation will be put upon it. It is a Com∣fort
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
that will remain with me in all Misfor∣tunes, that I serv'd Her Majesty faithfully and dutifully, in that especially, <HI>which She had most at Heart,</HI> relieving Her People from a bloody and expensive War: And that I have always been too much an <HI>Englishman,</HI> to sacrifice the Interest of my Country to <HI>any Foreign Ally what∣soever;</HI> and 'tis for this Crime only, that I am” now driven from thence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“You will hear more at large from me short∣ly.”</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>As soon as the House of Commons had settled their Committees, voted the Supply, call'd for the Estimates as usual, enter'd upon the particular Sums requir'd; and in their Debates of Ways and Means had voted the Land Tax of 3 <HI>s. per Pound;</HI> they began to fall to Work, with what had been so often Threaten'd, <HI>viz.</HI> calling People to an Ac∣count.</P>
<P>They had already Address'd the King to have laid before the House all the Powers, Instructions, Memorials, Letters, and Papers, relating to the late Negotiations of Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and these being very large, and particular, were the Ground of the Motion made by Mr. Secretary <HI>Stanhope, (viz.)</HI> that a Secret Committee might be appointed, to which they should all be referr'd, which was ac∣cordingly agreed to, and a Committee of 21 was chosen by Ballot; and they again, when chosen, elected Mr. <HI>Robert Walpole</HI> to be Chairman; and thus the Affair of the late Reign was put into a Kind of Method for a judicial Process.</P>

<P>To these were, at several Times, referr'd all the Papers which the House thought fit to call for, relating to the Publick Administration in the late Reign; those particularly about the Demolishing <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> Establishing the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company; the Treaties of Peace, and Treaties of Commerce.</P>
<P>They sat <HI>de Die in Diem,</HI> during the Recess of the House at <HI>Easter,</HI> and went on with incredible Application.</P>
<P>In this Interval, happen'd that famous, and in∣deed remarkable Eclipse of the Sun, <HI>viz. April</HI> 22. the most perfect and total Darkness that has been known in the World from such a Cause; the Day being bright, and warm, perfectly clear, and not one Cloud seen in the Horizon; it began at six Minutes after Eight in the Morning, and the whole Body of the Sun being shut in, as it were behind a Curtain, about Nine the Stars appear'd,
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
the Birds astonish'd sunk to the Earth, and to their Roosting Places, and the Sun continu'd cen∣terally eclips'd and totally darken'd for about three Minutes, to the great Terror and Amazement of the Vulgar and Ignorant part of the People, and even to the Surprize of others; for all the Schemes drawn and publish'd by the most Eminent Astro∣nomers allow'd, that a small Part of the Verge of the Suns Circle would be left open, which it was not, no not the least Part of it.</P>
<P>But I return to the Parliament.</P>
<P>The Voting the usual Supplies, I need not men∣tion, it being what of course goes on in every Session. But the main thing which occasion'd Debate, was settling the Revenue of 700000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> for the Maintenance of the King's Houshold, called, <HI>The Civil List;</HI> there were some Objections made to the Sum, as being too great, and more than Queen <HI>Anne</HI> possess'd, because of the Payments, made then by her Majesty upon several Extraor∣dinary Occasions.</P>
<P>However, as the Court Party had now a Lead∣ing Majority in the House, they were thought able to carry every Demand which they thought fit to insist on, and this in particular.</P>
<P>Some more great Officers were now made, particularly in the Army. As follows,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Duke of <HI>Montague,</HI> was made Captain of the First Troop of Horse Guards; formerly call'd, the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI>'s Troop.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Earl of <HI>Hertford</HI> of the Second.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>Newburgh</HI> had the Third.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Lord <HI>Lumley</HI> had the First Troop of Horse Grenadiers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Earl of <HI>De Lorain,</HI> the Second.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="77" REF="78"/>
The Earl of <HI>Stairs,</HI> had General <HI>Ecclin</HI>'s Dra∣goons, who was publickly Dismiss'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>William Kerr,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Brother to the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> was made Colonel of Dra∣goons. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>William Harrison,</HI> Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, formerly the Earl of <HI>Hertford</HI>'s.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>About this Time died three Leading Men indeed on the Court Side, one in the Church, and two in State; <HI>viz.</HI> First, Dr. <HI>Gilbert Burnet,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who died the 17th of <HI>March; Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Wharton,</HI> who died the 12th of <HI>April;</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> Earl of <HI>Halifax,</HI> first Commissioner of the Treasury, who died the 19th of <HI>May;</HI> this last, an honourable Mention has been made of for his Moderation; I cannot say, that the other were any way to be charg'd with that Sin.</P>
<P>The Parliament Affairs went on without any considerable Opposition, the <HI>Land Tax,</HI> the <HI>Malt Tax,</HI> and a <HI>Bill for regulating the Forces,</HI> had alrea∣dy receiv'd the Royal Assent; and the House seem'd indeed, to be kept sitting, principally upon Account of the Party Affairs, mentioned be∣fore.</P>
<P>In the Committee of <HI>Secrecy</HI> Matters run high, and they began to promise to make their Report ready very speedily: On the 9th of <HI>June,</HI> the Chair-Man acquainted the House, that the Report was ready, but before they presented it, the Committee thought fit to exert in some Particular manner, the Power of the House. <Q>“It is true, they had Power in themselves to send for Persons as well as Papers, and Records, yet they thought it necessary rather (to give their own Words) in order to bring Offenders to Justice, that some
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
Persons should be secur'd before 'twas possible they should know what they were to be examin'd to; and lest they should have Notice to make their Escape: Then the Chair-man added, That he was commanded (according to former Precedents) to move, that a Warrant may be Issued by Mr. Speaker to apprehend certain Persons who shall be named to him by the Chair-Man of the said Committee; and that no Members may be per∣mitted to go out of the House. <HI>Hereupon it was</HI> Ordered, <HI>First,</HI> That the Lobby be clear'd of all Strangers, the back Doors of the Speaker's Chamber lock'd up, the Key brought, and laid upon the Table. And that the Serjeant do stand at the Door of the House, and suffer no Mem∣ber to go forth. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That Mr. <HI>Speaker</HI> do Issue his Warrant to the Serjeant, to take into his Custody such Persons as shall be named by the Chairman of the Committee of Secresy, in order to their being examin'd before them.”</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon Mr. <HI>Speaker</HI> issued his Warrants, to take into Custody several Persons that were named by Mr <HI>Walpole,</HI> particularly Mr. <HI>Matthew Prior,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Harley,</HI> the first of whom was im∣mediately apprehended, and the other some Hours after.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> acquainted the House, <Q>“That the Committee of Secrecy had perused the Books and Papers referr'd to them, and had agreed upon a Report, which they had commanded him to make: That it was contain'd in two Books, one of which was the Report, and the other an Appendix to it, which contain'd at large those Letters and Papers which were referr'd to in the Report.”</Q> He read the Report, and deliver'd it in at the Table, with the Appendix, and the
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
Books which were referr'd to the said Committee. The reading of the Report having taken up from One 'till about Six in the Afternoon, a Motion was made by the Friends of the <HI>late Ministry,</HI> and the Question put, That the further Consideration of it be adjourn'd 'till the next Morning, it was carry'd in the Negative, by 282 Votes, to 171; and or∣der'd, that <HI>the Report be now read:</HI> Upon which the Clerk of the House having read 'till half an Hour past Eight, the further Consideration of it was adjourn'd 'till the next Morning.</P>
<P>The apprehending Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> being thus done, with so much Ceremony, and the Report read, which contain'd so many Sheets, that it was said to be eight Hours in Reading them, as above, and the House could not go through it that Night; the next Day it was finish'd, and read a second Time, and order'd to be Printed; which has been done ac∣cordingly, and therefore need not to be repeated in this History.</P>
<P>As soon as the second Reading was over, the Grand Affair began, for the Chairman stood up, and Impeach'd the Lord Viscount <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> of high Treason, and high Crimes and Misdeme∣nors: after which, the Lord <HI>Coningsby,</HI> as it had been concerted, Impeach'd the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> ma∣king some Flourishes to introduce it.</P>
<P>It is remarkable here, that even at the Time this Impeachment was brought in, a certain Mem∣ber, not only of the House, but of the Secret Com∣mittee also, was said to acknowledge the Defici∣ency of the Charge, in the Terms following, or to that Purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81"/>
<HI>That as to the Lord</HI> Bolingbroke, <HI>They had more than sufficient Evidence to convict him of high Treason, upon the Statute</HI> 25 Edw. III. <HI>But that as to the Earl of</HI> Oxford, <HI>he doubted whether they had either sufficient Matter, or Evidence to Impeach him of Treason.</HI></P>
<P>But the Resolution was nevertheless pass'd, not∣withstanding so ingenious an Acknowledgment, and so the Earl was also Impeach'd. A certain Gentleman, saying, that they had other Evidence, and other Facts, which, however, never yet appear'd, and if it had, it must be observ'd that it did not appear then, and yet, that the Resolu∣tion for the Impeachment pass'd without Divid∣ing.</P>
<P>These Evidences we have of the Warmth with which things were carry'd on at that Time, of which I shall say no more, 'till I come to the Issue of the Impeachment it self.</P>
<P>Upon the Voting these Impeachments, the House order'd the Committee of Secrecy to draw up Articles, and prepare Evidence, as usual in such Cases, and then adjourn'd their farther prosecuting that Part for a Week.</P>
<P>But Time had no Influence yet to cool their Vigour in these Proceedings, or at least, the In∣tervals being too short for such an Effect, the Time which was taken, rather serv'd to Fer∣ment them to a greater Degree; for the next Days were taken up in the farther Pursuit of the same Point. And on the 19th the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was Impeach'd of high Treason. Also the next Day the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was Impeach'd of high Crimes and Misdemeanors.</P>
<P>Here they thought fit to make a Stop; there was a great Struggle to have saved the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> from this Blow. But it was in vain. Not
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
the past Sufferings of his Family for the Mo∣narchy; not his steady Adherance to the Church; not his long Services in the Field; not his excellent Conduct at <HI>Vigo:</HI> No past Merit could Weigh against the publick Resentment, or ward the fatal Blow off from him, which very unhappily precipi∣tated him into Measures which have since finish'd his Ruin; and which, whatever others may think, I never saw Cause to believe he had entertain'd the least Thought of before.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledg'd here also, that the ill tim'd indiscreet Affection of the Common People to the Duke, had too much Share in his Fall; For the Mobbs and Rabbles, of which mention has been made, and which even the wisest Men among those who were against the Measures of the pre∣sent Administration did not approve of, were in∣excusably to Blame, in making use of the Duke's Name, as the Characteristick to the Party; crying in the Street, <HI>Ormond, Ormond,</HI> for ever! In Op∣position to the Cry of the <HI>Whiggish</HI> Mobbs, of King GEORGE, forever!</P>
<P>This setting the Duke's Name in a direct Op∣position to the King's, tho' no Man could ever say he consented to, or approv'd of it, did him a manifest Injury, and had, I believe, too great a Share in his Misfortunes. However, let that be as it will, the Duke's unhappy Conduct <HI>since</HI> has too much justified all the Measures of his Ene∣mies, and entirely ruined him and his Family. and not one Word can be said, but what Pity extorts, for the Loss of some of the Finest and Greatest PERSONAGES amongst the <HI>English</HI> Nobility.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="83"/>
The Duke finding it was impossible for him to stem this Current, and that he could not expect any Favour when Things run thus high, withdrew al∣so, and conveyed himself over to <HI>France,</HI> as the Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> had done before.</P>
<P>As Things were thus warm in the House, so the Tumults, of which I have made mention be∣fore, encreased to that height, in the <HI>Northern</HI> Parts especially, that they wanted little of an open Re∣bellion: And indeed, had the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> with any Number of Troops from Abroad, land∣ed in the Interim, as it was given out he would, it would certainly have been a Rebellion at that time: But they were utterly distitute of Support from Abroad. And it must be acknowledged, to the exquisite Management of the King, that by his Influence and Intelligence Abroad, all the At∣tempts made in any part of the World, to get As∣sistance, Ships, Men or Money, were effectually disappointed.</P>
<P>These Tumults, however, made the Nation ve∣ry uneasy; even those who were as male-contented as any body, with the present Measures, yet trembled at the Rage of the Rabble; knowing well that an enflam'd Multitude distinguish not Friends from Enemies. None but such whose Circumstan∣ces were desperate, or Principles directly Jaco∣bite, could be pleased with the confused Circum∣stances which the Nation seemed to be in upon that Occasion; Every body else dreaded the Con∣sequences: However, as the Parliament was sitting, Relief was expected from them; and accordingly Information being given of some of those Riots just then happening in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> where they were carried on to an Extravagance scarce credi∣ble, the House took it into their Consideration,
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
and Address'd the King, that the Magistrates, Ju∣stices of the Peace, and others, should be encou∣raged to do their Duty in suppressing Tumults; that those who fail'd in their Duty might be pu∣nished; and that an Account of the Damages suf∣fered by any of his Majesty's Subjects should be brought in, and the Loss made good to them by the Publick. This was a great Encouragement to the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in particular, who had suffered in∣deed deeply in the Demolishing of their Meeting-Houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the Mobs; and who in Virtue of this Resolution received, some time after, very ample Satisfaction in Money for the same.</P>
<P>Upon this Occasion also, that well-known Law was pass'd by the House of Lords first, and after∣wards by the Commons, Entituled, <HI>An Act for preventing Tumults,</HI> &amp;c. and which is still in Force; whereby the County or Hundred is made answer∣able for the Damages committed by the Rabble; and the Rioters who shall continue together after Reading to them certain Words express'd in the Act, are guilty of Felony; upon which very Act, several Persons have been since Executed; as par∣ticularly 2 in <HI>Worcestershire,</HI> and Five in <HI>Fleetstreet, London.</HI></P>
<P>But Things were by all these degrees only ri∣pening up for worse; for on the 20th of <HI>July,</HI> the same Day that the King came to the House to pass the abovemention'd Act for Preventing Tumults, his Majesty gave them an Account that he had certain Advice that the Pretender from Abroad, and a Party at Home, were preparing for an At∣tempt against the Government. This Speech o∣pened the first real View to the Nation of the ap∣proaching Rebellion, and is as follows:</P>
<Q><PB N="84" REF="85"/>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>THE Zeal you have shewn for preserving the Peace of my Kingdoms, and your Wisdom in providing so good a Law to prevent all riotons and tumultuous Proceedings, give me great Satisfaction; but I am sorry to find that such a Spirit of Rebellion has discover∣ed it self as leaves no Room to doubt but these Disorders are set on Foot and encouraged by Persons disaffected to my Government, in Expectation of being supported from Abroad.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Preservation of our excellent Constitution, and the Security of our holy Religion, has been, and always shall be, my chief Care; and I cannot question but your Concern for these invaluable Blessings is so great, as not to let them be exposed to such Attempts as I have certain Advices are preparing by the Pretender from abroad, and carrying on at home by a restless Party in his Favour.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>In these Circumstances, I think it proper to ask your Assistance, and make no doubt but you will so far consult your own Security, as not to leave the Nation, under a Rebellion actually begun at home, and threatned with an Invasion from abroad, in a defenceless Condition. And I shall look upon the Provision you shall make for the Safety of my People, as the best Mark of your Affe∣ction to me.</HI></P>
<P>The House of Commons, upon this surprizing News, Voted, as they could indeed do no less, an Humble Address to Thank his Majesty for com∣municating to them, <HI>the Advices he has received of an Attempt preparing to be made upon the Nation from abroad, aletted and encouraged by treasonable Practices</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
<HI>at home, in favour of a Popish Pretender; and to assure his Majesty, that this House will, with their Lives and Fortunes, stand by and support his Majesty against all his open and secret Enemies; and to desire his Majesty, that he will immediately give Directions for fitting out such a Number of Ships as may effectually guard the Coasts, and to issue out Commissions for augmenting his Forces by Land; assuring his Majesty, this House will, without Loss of Time, effectually enable him to raise and maintain such a Number of Forces, both by Sea and Land, as shall be necessary for the Defence of his sacred Person, and for the Security of his Kingdoms.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Lords also presented an Address to the same Purpose.</P>
<P>To back those Addresses with suitable Supplies, they immediately Voted Money for the raising Three Thousand Dragoons, and Four Thousand Foot, besides Four Companies of Foot to be ad∣ded to the Coldstream Regiment, call'd the Second Regiment of Foot Guards, to make it up Two Batallions.</P>
<P>But this was not all; for the House, zealous for the Publick Safety, in so critical a Time, went immediately upon an Act, which nothing but the imminent Danger of a Rebellion could have pre∣vail'd upon them to have pass'd; I mean, an Act to suspend the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act for a certain Time, by Empowering the King to secure and detain such Persons as his Majesty shall suspect are Conspiring against his Person and Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>This Act has so much in it, that may be Matter of Precedent in like Cases, and was so much ob∣jected against, that I cannot omit, at least some part of it; in particular, that which relates to the Imprisoning of the Subject: The latter part,
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
relating to the Seizing and Selling Horses, I omit, as of least Consequence. The Act is as fol∣lows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>WHereas there has been a traiterous and detestable Conspiracy formed and contrived, and is still car∣rying on by</HI> Papists <HI>and other wicked Persons, for in∣vading this Realm, and to raise Insurrections and Re∣bellions within this Kingdom, to the utter Ruin and Subversion of the</HI> Protestant <HI>Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom; for the better Preser∣vation of his Majesty's sacred Person, and for securing the Peace of this Kingdom in this Time of imminent Danger, against all Attempts and Conspiracies whatso∣ever, be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiri∣tual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That every Person or Persons that shall be in Prison within the Kingdom of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>at or upon the Three and Twentieth Day of</HI> July, <HI>One Thousand Se∣ven Hundred and Fifteen, or after, by Warrant of his said Majesty's most honourable Privy-Council, signed by Six of the said Privy-Council, for Suspicion of High Treason, or treasonable Practices, or by Warrant signed by any of his Majesty's Secretaries of State, for such Causes aforesaid, may be detained in safe Custody with∣out Bail or Mainprize until the Four and Twentieth Day of</HI> January, <HI>in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifteen; and that no Judge or Justice of Peace shall bail or try any such Person or Persons without Order from his said Majesty's Privy-Council, signed by Six of the said Privy-Council, till the said Four and Twentieth Day of</HI> January, <HI>in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifteen; any Law or Statute to the contrary notwithstand∣ing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="88"/>
<HI>And be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Act made in</HI> Scotland <HI>in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and One, intituled,</HI> An Act for preventing wrongous Imprisonment, and against undue Delays in Tryals, <HI>until the said Four and Twentieth Day of</HI> January, <HI>in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifteen, be suspended as to all Cases of Treason and Suspicion of Treason.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Provided always, That from and after the said Four and twentieth Day of</HI> January, <HI>in the Year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred and fifteen, the said Persons so committed shall have the Benefit and Advantage of all Laws and Statutes any way relating to, or providing for the Liberty of the Subjects of this Realm; And that this present Act shall continue until the said Four and twentieth Day of</HI> January, <HI>in the Year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred and fifteen, and no longer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Provided always, and be it enacted, That nothing in this Act shall be construed to extend to Invalidate the ancient Rights and Privileges of Parliament, or to the Imprisonment, or Detaining of any Member of either House of Parliament, during the sitting of such Parlia∣ment, until the Matter of which he stands suspected be first communicated to the House of which he is a Mem∣ber, and the Consent of the said House obtained for his Commitment or Detaining.</HI></P></Q>
<P>On the 23d of <HI>July</HI> the King gave the Royal Assent to this Bill, and at the same Time a Bill was brought in for the farther Security of the King's Person, and the House then proceeded to address the King to take all the Half-pay Officers into whole Pay for a Year, least the Army should not be sufficient, and to assure the King that the House of Commons would supply the Extraordi∣nary
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
Expence of it out of the first Aids next Sessi∣on.</P>
<P>On the 28th, this Bill, entituled, For the farther Security of his Majesty's Person and Government was finished, and sent up to the Lords. In a Word, Nothing could be done or desired of any Parlia∣ment, to engage and assist the King, which they did not with the greatest readiness and alacrity come into; And in this Posture Things stood at the First of <HI>August,</HI> 1716, when the King entred into the Second Year of his Reign, a Year of Trouble, of early Anxiety, and of much Disor∣der, Civil War, and Blood, tho' ending in Victo∣ry and Triumph.</P>

<HEAD>ANNO 1716.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S was express'd in the Close of the last Year, the Second Year of the King was a Year of Victory and Triumph; that is, it Ended in Triumph.</P>
<P>But alas! What Triumph, what Joy has a Father of a Family in the Ruin of the most Disobedient of his Children? What Triumph can a King, who is, or should be, a Father of his Country, make over his ruin'd, tho' rebellious, Subjects? Small Joy can be conceived, to a Mer∣ciful Prince, in the Destruction of his own People, whose Blood is the Strength of the Body Politick, and whose Sorrows and Sufferings must needs (sympathetically speaking) be his own.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91"/>
However, Rebellion must be resisted; and be they Political Children or Natural Children, 'tis all one, the Disobedient must be reduced, and that even at their own Expence, if it can be done no other way.</P>
<P>This remarkable Year begins so evidently with the Beginning of the Publick Distractions, that this part of our first Volume will be of Course a Histo∣ry of the Rebellion; and tho' I shall be obliged to treat these Subjects in a more concise manner than ordinary, being obliged to bring the History of Four Years into the Compass of One, yet I pro∣mise my self it shall be a more Compleat History of the Rebellion than any that has yet been be∣stow'd upon this Age.</P>
<P>The Beginning of this Second Year of the King, I say, has a different Aspect from the First: At his first Accession the whole People, as one Man, seem'd to be with him; all concurr'd with the Succession of King <HI>GEORGE;</HI> and so forward to make their Court, that many who thought themselves a little weak in Interest, scrupled not to make that Court at the Expence of one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>But now the Court had, as I may say, a fiery Tryal to go through, and a New Part to act: Every Day brought in Accounts of Tumults, Ri∣ots, Breaches of the Peace, and open Preparati∣ons for War, as well Abroad as at Home, till at length it broke out into open Rebellion, Battle and Bloodshed.</P>
<P>The Parliament having, as I have said, given the King Assurances of their readiness to Support his Interest against all his Enemies at Home or Abroad, gave a full Demonstration of it in pas∣sing that Eminent Act, which I just now na∣med,
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
for empowering the King to secure and detain such Persons as should be suspected to be conspiring against his Person and Government: This Act, in a word, put the Liberty of every <HI>British</HI> Subject absolutely into the King's Power, for Six Months; and in Virtue of this Act, abun∣dance of Suspected Persons were taken into Cu∣stody, whereof some lay a great while in Pri∣son.</P>
<P>This was the <HI>happy Severity,</HI> which, as was ta∣ken Notice of afterwards by the Lord Chancellor, prevented some Gentlemen from falling into the Misery which it was probable would have been the Consequence of their Liberty, if they had join'd in the Rebellion, as it was very likely some of them would have done.</P>
<P>The House having settled this Point, in the next place Voted Supplies for the Troops, which by a former Vote they had consented to have rais'd.</P>
<P>The Government was now Intent upon their Warlike Preparations, and the King applied himself with a peculiar Vigor, to put himself in a Posture to meet the Dangers which threatned him. Sir <HI>George Byng</HI> was appointed to Command the Squadron of Ships which were ordered to be fitted out on this Occasion, and their Rendezvous was order'd to be in the <HI>Downs,</HI> that they might be ready as Occasion might require; for it was not known yet where the impending Cloud would break.</P>
<P>General <HI>Erle</HI> was order'd to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> where he was Governor, and a Detachment of Troops were sent to Reinforce the Garrison, there having been some Rumours of Designs to Surprize that Fortress: A Camp having been appointed in <HI>Hyde-Park,</HI> the Regiments of Guards, as well Horse
<PB N="92" REF="93"/>
as Foot, Encamp'd there; and this it was said, was done as well to secure the Fidelity of the Soldiers, as to have them ready at hand for any Service as Occasion might require. It was said this Camp was to be made up to Ten Thousand Men; but the other Troops had Employment found them farther off.</P>
<P>The Train'd Bands of the City, and the Mili∣tia of several Counties, were ordered to be ready in order to suppress Tumults, the chief Thing perhaps which they were Serviceable for. And the King sent an Order to the Lord-Mayor, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to take care of the Publick Peace.</P>
<P>The Country Towns and Corporations, led on by the Bishop and Clergy of <HI>London,</HI> then by the City of <HI>London, (viz.)</HI> the Lord-Mayor, Alder∣men and Common Council, crowded up to Court with their Addresses, wherein, even Prodigal of Words, (which cost little) they lay'd Life and Fortune at his Majesty's Feet in a most extraor∣dinary manner: And if the Loyalty was to be Calculated by the Appearance of, and Language in the Addresses, all Things were out of Danger on the King's Side.</P>
<P>I hope it will be concluded, that I am not so empty of Matter as to take up any of these Sheets in repeating those Unmeaning things call'd Ad∣dresses, or the Customary Answers given to them; 'tis enough to say, they were Generally receiv'd very well, and answer'd in the most obliging Terms.</P>
<P>The University of <HI>Oxford</HI> had the Misfortune to be the only Body whose Address was not receiv'd: But it seems some of the Universities back Friends were pleased to represent them so, as that
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
they had some Intimation that their Address would not be acceptable; so it was not presented at all.</P>
<P>The Vigor of these Proceedings gave Credit to the Publick Affairs, and was partly the Reason why the Court of <HI>France</HI> did not care to meddle, nor to appear, at least in assisting the Party; nay, so Pusillanimous some Great People abroad ap∣peared, that the Regent of <HI>France</HI> perfectly aban∣don'd the Pretender, and neither gave him any Assistance, or so much as protected those who sol∣licited his Affairs.</P>
<P>The Parliament in the mean time, to make themselves Terrible to the Party, began to push on their Judicial Proceedings. The Secret Com∣mittee fell to work with their Impeachments, and particularly, they exhibited 5 new Articles against the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and seem'd to breath out the Extream of Resentment against that noble Per∣son, who had now, with an inimitable Courage, put himself into their Hands, and was actually a Prisoner in the Tower. These Articles were said to be those which some Persons had reserv'd in Petto against the Earl, and which were to secure his Prosecution; but they were all too short in their aim at this Great Man, who, we have since seen, by a wonderful Turn of Providence, fully deliver'd out of the Hands of all his Enemies, Whether by the Folly of his Opposers, or the Strength of his own Merit and Innocence, the Se∣quel may make appear at large. These particular Articles, however, were thought of Moment, and therefore I take this Notice of them by way of abstract. It seems it was the affair of the unfor∣tunate Expedition to <HI>Canada,</HI> that brought these farther Enquiries upon the Stage; which seeing
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
they appear'd to be under the Earl's Direction, they were willing to lay as much of them to his Charge as they thought might belong to him, though the Articles made no mention of that Af∣fair neither. The Substance of these Articles was as follows:</P>
<P N="1">1. That he had misapplied 12000 <HI>l.</HI> which was receiv'd on the Earl's Account, by a Warrant from the Queen, obtain'd to one <HI>John Drum∣mond,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>
<P N="2">2. That he had sent abroad Agents of his own, without the Communication of the Allies, to set on foot separate and dangerous Negotiati∣ons, giving them unlimited Credit to draw Bills on him as Treasurer, and had in that manner paid 17920 <HI>l.</HI> to Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> and Mr. <HI>Harley,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. That he advised the paying 47000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to the Queen Dowager.</P>
<P N="4">4. That he advised the receiving Sir <HI>Patrick Lawless</HI> as a Minister from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and did negotiate with him the most Important Affairs, notwithstanding he was a Subject of the Crown, and under the guilt of High Treason, coun∣tenancing thereby the Emissaries of the Preten∣der.</P>
<P N="5">5. That he had advised her Majesty to abandon the <HI>Catalans;</HI> at the same time amusing them with Hopes of Care being taken of their Inte∣rests, and treating with the King of <HI>Spain</HI> with∣out making any Provision for them.</P>
<P>This Month the King came twice to the House in less than Twenty days, to pass Bills, occasion∣ed principally by the weight and import of the Bills which were prepared, and the unusual Expe∣dition
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
which the House made in passing them: The particular Things I refer to in this, were, the Im∣peachment of the Earl of <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> and of the Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> which having not been effectu∣al, by reason of their being withdrawn from the Storm which they saw falling, were follow'd with special Acts of Attainder upon them both.</P>
<P>It was for some time hoped the Duke, at least, would have been excused, having a great stock of Merit for former Services to plead in his Favour; but it would not over-ballance the Charge now brought against him: And his Impeachment be∣ing first carried in the House of Commons by—Voices, he fled, as is said above, and the Attainder was a thing in course.</P>
<P>Some have said, that his Majesty himself had a mind to have Excused the Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> but as the House of Commons seemed very much en∣clin'd to push the Prosecution of these Things without any Respect of Persons, it was not thought convenient to Interpose: So the Duke was left to his Fate.</P>
<P>The Articles of Impeachment against them both, as they are too long for this Tract, so be∣ing publickly Printed on so many several Occasi∣ons, it would be needless to take up any of the Room in this Work. As to the Acts of Attain∣der, they are upon Record, and being Things of course, it is enough to say they were attaint∣ed.</P>
<P>The several Acts pass'd on these Occasions, were as follows:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>An Act for the better preventing Mutiny and Deser∣tion.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="96" REF="97"/>
<HI>An Act for making more effectual her late Majesty's Intention for augmenting the Maintenance of the Poor Clergy.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>An Act to oblige all Waggoners,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to draw with no more than Five Horses.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>An Act for Repairing the Highways from</HI> Barnet <HI>to St.</HI> Albans.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>An Act for Enlarging the Fund of the Bank.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>An Act for making the Militia of</HI> England <HI>more useful.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>An Act for the farther Security of his Majesty's Person and Government.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>An Act for Attainder of</HI> Henry, <HI>Lord Viscount</HI> Bolin∣broke.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>An Act for Attainder of</HI> James, <HI>Duke of</HI> Or∣mond.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>An Act for making a former Act more effectual for Regulating the Manufacture of Medly Cloth.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>An Act for preventing the Importation of Foreign Fresh Fish.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>All this while the Government were not Idle; indeed it could not be supposed that any Govern∣ment could be Idle in the Circumstances they were in; for every Post brought repeated Accounts of the Disaffection of the People, and of the for∣wardness of the Pretender's Friends, as well a∣broad as at home. As, therefore, they were a∣larm'd every Day with the approaches of Mischief, so they spar'd no Pains to let their Enemies see they would be soon in a Posture to receive them, and to give them occasion to repent any rash At∣tempt they might make; and thus I am brought even to the Beginning of the Rebellion.</P>
<P>The first Publick Thing done, which throughly convinc'd us that the Government had some In∣sight
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
into what was contriving against them, was, That as the King had formerly notified to the <HI>States General</HI> the just Reasons he had to believe Designs were forming to disturb the Publick Peace, and to intimate that his Majesty expected their Assistance in the Terms of the several Treaties at that time subsisting <HI>(viz.)</HI> that they would send over 6000 Men to his Assistance; so now his Ma∣jesty resolved to demand the said 6000 Men.</P>
<P>Nor was this a fruitless Demand, for the <HI>Dutch</HI> readily and cheerfully granted it, and sent back word immediately to his Majesty, that they should be ready at his Service, whenever his Occasions requir'd them.</P>
<P>As the King was thus gathering together a Force to ward off the Blow when it came, so his Servants and Ministry were busy in diving secretly into the most retir'd Combinations and Cabinets of his E∣nemies, that if possible by alarming them at first, their Measures might be disconcerted, and they might be Disabled from the Undertaking it self.</P>
<P>In this, they were so Vigilant, and withal so Fortunate, that had they but struck one Blow more, and secured one Man more, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> it has been thought by many, the Rebel∣lion had not been undertaken at all; or at least, had not been undertaken at that time.</P>
<P>And on the other hand, had not the Measures which the Ministry took, been thus vigorous and timely, it was very probable that the Rebellion which follow'd had not been so Cheap a purchase to the Conqueror: And though it seems hardly probable, that they could have prevailed effectual∣ly to have set the <HI>Pretender</HI> actually upon the Throne; yet it was more than probable, that
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
they would have made this Nation the Seat of a long and bloody War, in which the Country must have been too much a Prey to the Foreign Troops, who, perhaps, on both Sides would have come over as Auxiliaries to their respective Parties.</P>
<P>In order to these Discoveries, the vigilant Mi∣nistry were not wanting of either Secret Agents at home, or Intelligence from abroad; by which they fail'd not to know what was doing in every Place. All the Measures the <HI>Pretender</HI> took a∣broad to get Arms and Ammunition, to engage Officers, and obtain Troops; to hire Ships, and load Necessaries, were every where Detected, Counter-acted, and Disappointed; Ships procur'd in <HI>France</HI> were discovered, and by the Regent, who began to act a New Part, (not often heard of in <HI>France)</HI> forbidden to stir; Ships hir'd, Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> bought in <HI>Holland, Hamburgh,</HI> and other Parts, stop'd, and the Persons obliged to scour off, and make the best of their way, for fear of being apprehended: So that in a Word, the <HI>Pre∣tender</HI> had not a Port where he could openly make any Preparations, or where either himself or any of his Friends could Embark, other than Incogni∣to, and with the greatest Privacy: And this is the reason why, (if it were true, <HI>as the E. of</HI> Mar <HI>him∣self declared in Print)</HI> that all that was done, was purely brought to pass by the Zeal and Ardour of those who engag'd on this side; not one Ship with Arms, or Ammunition, or Money, arriving from any of their Friends abroad to their Assistance, all the while they were in Arms.</P>
<P>It is true, we were told otherwise; and it was certain, that several Vessels did arrive, tho' we knew not what they brought; but it seems, tho' we were told much of the great Quantities of Arms, Cannon,
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
Powder, Ball, Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they brought over with them; yet, according to the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> it must be all a Mistake.</P>
<P>But to return to the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> and with him to the beginning of the Year; for it is observed, that the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> having taken his Measures before, entered upon his fatal Undertaking the very First of <HI>August,</HI> the Day Twelve Month of the King's Accession. It is reported, how true I know not, that he went from the very Court, where there was a Ball, and great Appearance of the Nobility and Gentry, on the Occasion; that he made his Complement, and from that Hour commenc'd the Rebellion, going that very Even∣ing down the River, having received his Com∣mission from the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and sail'd directly for <HI>Scotland,</HI> where he set up the Standard of his Ma∣ster, as he then call'd the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and proclaim∣ed him King.</P>
<P>Here it is said again, that the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> would gladly have fallen in with the Government, had the Ministry here, either known his Inclinati∣ons so much, or thought him so considerable as to have believ'd it worth while to have received him: And perhaps it might have been so far worth their while to have, by that Means, kept his Hands out of a Work which brought so much loss of Trea∣sure and Blood upon the Nation.</P>
<P>I do not say, as some have suggested, that they saw it, and thought it not worth their while; for certainly had they not thought it worth while to have prevented the Rebellion by entertaining him in the Service, they would have thought it worth while to have done it by detaining him in Custody: And for this Reason, I rather believe the Government had no Notion of his Resoluti∣on,
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
much less any Intimation or Intelligence of his Design: Neither do I find any thing of his Design laid so deep as some have published, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That he had Concerted the several Risings which were afterwards spoken of; or that he had re∣ceived a Remittance of 100000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>For, in the whole Management of his Under∣taking, it appeared, there was a manifest Defici∣ency of Money, till he found means to levy Con∣tributions in the Country, and intercept some of the Publick Money; and that he had by no means, any such Encouragement, in the whole, as an Hun∣dred Thousand Pounds Sterling would have been to his Undertaking.</P>
<P>But to go back to his particular Proceedings, He embark'd the next Morning, having with him only Lieutenant General <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and two Gen∣tlemen more. They landed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> on the North Shore of the Firth of Forth, at a little Sea∣port call'd <HI>Creil,</HI> from whence passing by Land to the Bank of Tay, they came to <HI>Dundee,</HI> where being a little more Master of his own Safety, he had some Conference with his Friends; but made little stay, making his way into the County call'd by his own Name, or rather from whence he takes his Title, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The County of <HI>Mar.</HI></P>
<P>Being arriv'd at <HI>Killdrummy,</HI> a Seat of his own, he sends private Summons, or Invitations, to such of his Vassals as he thought convenient, and to several Gentlemen in the Counties adjacent, who he knew were in the same Interest, to meet him at a Great Council, as they call'd it, to be held the 16th.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102"/>
The Assembly was indeed very Great, and, if my Account is Right, was much greater than any of our Accounts represented it to be: Here in par∣ticular assembled the Marquis of <HI>Huntley,</HI> Eldest Son to the Duke of <HI>Gordon;</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Tul∣libardin,</HI> Eldest Son to the Duke of <HI>Athol;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Nithsdale,</HI> the same who afterwards made his Escape out of the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> the Earls of <HI>Marischal, Traquhair, Errol, Southesk, Carnwarth, Seaforth, Lithgow,</HI> and several others, with the Viscounts <HI>Kilsyth, Kenmure, Kingston,</HI> and <HI>Stor∣mount,</HI> and the Lords <HI>Rollo, Duffus,</HI> and <HI>Drum∣mond,</HI> and about Twenty-six Gentlemen of Interest in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> whose Names we have not had Opportunity to get a List of: Among whom were, in particular, the Two Generals <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Gordon; Glengary, Glenderule, Auchterhouse, Drummond, Don Donald,</HI> and others, from the <HI>Clans.</HI></P>
<P>Many People have pretended to give us a for∣mal Copy of the Earl's Speech to this Assembly; but I see nothing authentick enough of that kind to be depended upon; the best Abstract which I have met with, of what pass'd, is as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P>That here the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> in a set Speech, excited them all to take up Arms for King <HI>James</HI> VIII. as he then called the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and let them know what part he resolved to take with them; <HI>(viz.)</HI> That he resolved to set up the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Standard, and to Summon all the fencible Men of his own Tenants, and with them to hazard his Life in the Cause. He encouraged them likewise by giving them assurances, 1. That there would be a General Rising in <HI>England</HI> upon the same Foot, and perhaps nam'd the particular Places and Per∣sons who really intended, tho' afterwards disap∣pointed,
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
to have been Raised. 2. That they should certainly have powerful Assistance from <HI>France,</HI> and from other Parts whence their King, as he call'd him, had already had large Supplies, and Promises of more. 3. That he shewed them the Letters he had received from <HI>Lorrain,</HI> under the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s own Hand, promising to come o∣ver to them in Person, and put himself upon the Valour and Fidelity of his <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects, and that in the mean Time they should be sure of Ships, with Arms, Ammunition, and all Military Stores, come to them; with Officers, Engineers, and Voluntiers, as soon as they could give him an Account to what Port they would direct them to be sent. 4. Shew'd them his Commission under the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s own Hand, nominating him Lieu∣tenant General, Commander in Chief, and Di∣rector of the War. And lastly, He assur'd them that he was furnish'd with Money, and should from Time to Time be supplied with sufficient Sums to levy Men, and regularly to pay the Troops that should be raised: So that no Gentlemen should be at any Expence to subsist his Men; but that both they and the Country should be eased of all Burdens of that kind.</P>
<P>If all these Things were represented to them, in a manner suitable to the Occasion, as we have good Assurances they were, we may the less wonder that so many Gentlemen were imposed upon, and drawn into this Insurrection, which, perhaps, would otherwise have reserved themselves to bet∣ter Fortunes: But such Pretences as these, and follow'd immediately by Performances of several Parts of them, it must be confess'd, were as well Calculated to draw the People of that Country in, as could be expected even by themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104"/>
This Speech, or whatever farther the Earl might say to animate a Set of Men already prepar'd for the Work, and who perhaps waited for nothing but to see a Person Authorized, as they may call it, from the <HI>Pretender</HI> to head them, had the desi∣red Effect; for they all separated with assurances to one another, to go immediately to work to arm their Men, and put them in a readiness to appear at such Time and Place as the Earl by farther Notice should appoint.</P>
<P>The Earl, who had now made himself Head of the Undertaking, had no more to do but to begin the War himself, and therefore, making no Delay, but drawing his own Men together, with the Assistance of those Gentlemen who were near∣est hand, he appoints the General Rendezvous at <HI>Aboyn</HI> in <HI>Aberdeenshire,</HI> on the 3d of <HI>September,</HI> and having found a considerable Number of Men ready at the Place, they march'd by Concert to the Hills, and Proclaimed the <HI>Pretender,</HI> setting up his Standard at <HI>Brae-Marr,</HI> and giving him all the Titles of King, as used before the Union; <HI>(viz.)</HI> of <HI>Scotland, England, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. They had with them about 2000 Men, most Horse, and among them a great many Gentlemen, some Clergymen of the Episcopal Church, and two or three Noblemen, of whom hereafter.</P>
<P>The Dye being now cast, and the Sword drawn, the Scabbard behoved to be thrown away. They were not ignorant of the Power they had to deal with; that they had no Time to lose; and that the first thing they had to do was to Strengthen themselves in such a manner as that they might not be attack'd by such Forces as the King had then in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to march and possess them∣selves of some Place of Consideration, which might
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
serve them as a Place of Arms, and for a Retreat where they might make a stand, and by which means they might have Leisure to cut off the Com∣munication with the rest of <HI>Britain,</HI> and so the more effectually reduce all the Country behind them.</P>
<P>In order to this, they immediately separated their Forces, which where now Encreasing every Day, and the Heads of the Conspiracy, as it might be call'd, caused the <HI>Pretender</HI> to be Proclaimed in all the most Considerable Parts of the Country, as at <HI>Aberdeen</HI> by the Earl <HI>Marischal;</HI> by the Mar∣quis of <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> at <HI>Dunkeld</HI> in the Entrance of the Highlands of <HI>Athol;</HI> by the Marquis of <HI>Hunt∣ley,</HI> at <HI>Castle-Gordon</HI> in the North Highlands; by the Earl of <HI>Penmure,</HI> at <HI>Brechin;</HI> by Brigadier <HI>Mackintosh,</HI> at <HI>Inverness;</HI> by <HI>Graham</HI> of <HI>Claverhouse,</HI> at <HI>Montrose;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> himself, whose Body of Troops began now to be Considerable, and were said to be 6000 Men, advanced Southward to∣wards the River <HI>Tay,</HI> and stiling himself Lieuten∣ant General, sent a Detachment of Troops under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Southesk</HI> to seize upon the City of <HI>Perth;</HI> whereby he was not only master of the Pass over the <HI>Tay,</HI> but soon after made him∣self so far Master of the County of <HI>Fife,</HI> as to lay it under Contribution. And soon after possest himself of all the North-East Shore of <HI>Scotland,</HI> all the North Shore of the <HI>Firth,</HI> and all the Towns and Ports as well on the <HI>Firth</HI> as on the Sea, from <HI>Brunt-Island</HI> to <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Inver∣ness,</HI> and even of <HI>Inverness</HI> it self.</P>
<P>The Progress of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> being thus far accounted for, I come to look into the Measures taken at Home, and what particular Steps the
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
Government took for the Publick Security. It was plain, the whole Succession, as well as the Person of the King, was aim'd at in this Insur∣rection; and the King understood his Danger and his Interest also, too well to sit still in a Case which so particularly concerned both the Honour of his Government and the Safety of his Person; it must be acknowledged, that the King shew'd a very remarkable Steadiness, as to the Event of the Thing, and yet neglected nothing which Pru∣dence dictated to apply suitable Remedies to eve∣ry Part of the Distemper. But above all, it must be observ'd, That the Progress of the E. of <HI>Mar</HI> did not so alarm the Government as to cause them to leave any part of the Kingdom naked; which was, perhaps, one considerable View of those who made their Risings be in the most remote Parts another way.</P>
<P>But the Government rather seem'd to give a loose for some time to the Extravagancies in the North, than not with the utmost Vigilance and Application to secure every thing and every Part by which the Party could reap any Advantage, or break in upon them on any side nearer Home. Insomuch, that the <HI>Scots</HI> not seeing the Necessity of these Measures, began to complain, and to think themselves, as it were, abandon'd too much to the Ravages of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s Army, a great Detachment of which passing the <HI>Firth,</HI> insulted them even at the Gates of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> as shall be seen in its place.</P>
<P>But the Government soon made it appear, that this was absolutely necessary, and that Care should be taken of the South, as the animal Spirits, in Case of an Attack, fly to the Heart; for that it was apparent, the same Temper reign'd in these
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
Parts, and especially in the South-West Parts of the Kingdom, and threatned not only a powerful Insurrection at Home, but the landing of Help from Abroad; and particularly, the Duke of <HI>Or∣mond</HI> not only was expected, but did actually come in a <HI>French</HI> Frigat of Forty Guns, to <HI>Tor Bay,</HI> and landed there; but finding, by good Intelligence, that all Things were so well guarded that no At∣tempt was to be made, his Grace made off again so timely as not to be intercepted; though some Men of War were immediately dispatcht in quest of him.</P>
<P>In Pursuance of these Measures, leaving the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> to do his worst for a while, the Go∣vernment dispatch'd Troops down into the West and North-West Parts of the Island; as to <HI>Bristol, Bath, Exeter, Oxford,</HI> and other Places; in which Parts the Disaffection of the People had really appeared so very open, that they had avowed their Readiness to take Arms, if an Opportunity offered, and had more than declar'd, that such an Opportunity was expected by them: For in some Places they had gone so far as to provide Arms and Ammunition, Horses and Men, to be in rea∣diness for the Juncture which they look'd for, or the Watch-word that was to be given. In a word, the Forces were dispers'd through the whole Kingdom, and the Half-pay Officers were sent to proper Places, where they might be useful, as well to manage and discipline the Militia, as to encourage and direct the Gentry, in Case of any Surprize. And yet all was done in such a manner as that a small march, the Troops might upon any alarm be drawn into considerable Bodies, to assist one another: The Wisdom of this Disposition was its own Justification afterwards, when it ap∣peared
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
that this only was the Safety of the whole Nation; whereas, had an Army been drawn to∣gether at first, and sent into <HI>Scotland</HI> to have sup∣pressed the Rebellion on that side, <HI>England</HI> had without doubt been exposed to Insurrections in several Places, and perhaps too strong to be sup∣pressed, without Recalling part of that Army be∣fore their Work had been finish'd in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>While the Military Dispositions were thus di∣rected, the Civil Government was not Idle; Sus∣pected Persons were taken up in all Parts of the Kingdom, according to the Power granted by the Act of Parliament mention'd before; and this was done at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> as well as at <HI>London.</HI> Nor did the Government take their Aim wrong, as afterwards appeared; most, if not all, the Persons taken up, having given good Grounds to believe they had been actually in Arms, if they had not been thus prevented.</P>
<P>The chief Persons apprehended at this Time, were, the Duke of <HI>Powis,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Jersey</HI> and <HI>Scarsdale,</HI> the Lords <HI>Lansdown, Dunbar,</HI> and <HI>Du∣plin,</HI> Son-in-Law to the Earl of <HI>Oxford;</HI> Sir <HI>Mar∣maduke Constable;</HI> Sir <HI>William Wyndham</HI> was nam'd, but fled, and was apprehended by a Messenger, but made his Escape; and a Proclamation being publish'd for apprehending him, he surrendered, and was committed to the Tower. Col. <HI>Landown,</HI> Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> of Coomb, Sir <HI>George Brown,</HI> Mr. <HI>An∣stis,</HI> since King at Arms; Mr. <HI>Kynaston,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mackartney,</HI> Mr. <HI>Macdonald,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hibert,</HI> and ma∣ny others, some at <HI>London,</HI> some at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and some at the <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Dar∣wentwater,</HI> the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> and several other North Country Gentlemen, were order'd to be
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
taken up; but they prevented it, to their own Misfortune, by flying to Arms; And this began the Second Irruption, of which I shall speak in its place.</P>
<P>Some of the above-nam'd Gentlemen being Members of the House of Commons, the King was very tender in that Point, it being Parliament Time; so his Majesty, by Message, acquainted the House of it, <HI>September</HI> 21 st, signifying, <Q>“That having just Cause to suspect those Six Gentle∣men were engag'd in a Design to support the in∣tended Invasion of this Kingdom, his Majesty had therefore given Order for apprehending them, and desired the Consent of the House to Commit and Detain them, if he finds it necessary, in Pursuance of the late Act of Parliament Em∣powering” him so to do.</Q></P>
<P>In Answer to this, the House immediately gave up their Six Members to his Majesty's Pleasure, as to the Committing and Detaining them, in an Address to that Purpose; Returning Thanks to the King for his tender Regard to the Privileges of the House; And desired his Majesty would give Order for the Committing and Detaining the several Members mentioned in the said Message, pursuant to the Act of Parliament; which was af∣terwards accordingly done, tho' all of them were not immediately found; nor were all that were found, detain'd.</P>
<P>In <HI>Scotland</HI> they proceeded by another Method, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Summoning those they Suspected, to come in by a certain Day, and to give such Assurances of Fidelity to the Government, as the Law di∣rected; and this upon Pain of Imprisonment, and Confiscation of Estate, as by the Laws of that
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
Country. The Number of those who were Sum∣mon'd was exceeding Great; and because among them was to be seen almost all the Considerable Persons in the Rebellion, it may not be unprofi∣table to have the Account of them made publick, as follows:</P>

<P>While these Measures were taken here, such Troops as could be spared were sent Northward, especially into <HI>Cheshire, Lancashire,</HI> and to the Bor∣ders of <HI>Northumberland, (viz.)</HI> to <HI>Newcastle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne;</HI> which last Place went within a little of be∣ing Surpriz'd, as I shall observe in its order.</P>
<P>What Forces were in <HI>Scotland,</HI> were ordered to take Post at <HI>Sterling,</HI> to secure the important Pass of <HI>Sterling-Bridge;</HI> and in the Capital City of <HI>E∣dinburgh,</HI> where a Design to Surprize the Castle had been newly discovered, and the Persons who attempted it beaten off, a Serjeant of the Garri∣son who had assisted to Betray the Castle, with some of the Soldiers, were seized; the first of them, some time after the Rebellion was sup∣press'd, was Hang'd over the Wall of the Ca∣stle.</P>
<P>It must be confess'd, had the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> suc∣ceeded in the Design of Surprising <HI>Edinburgh</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
Castle, and Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> in that of Surprising <HI>New∣castle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> both which were, as it might be said, within an ace of being brought to pass, the Rebellion had been much more formidable than it was: For as one would have been effectu∣ally Master of the Capital City of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and thereby indeed of all <HI>Scotland</HI> it self; and the o∣ther of the Second Town in <HI>Britain,</HI> for Numbers of Men, Number of Ships, and Utensils of War; they would have had not only Time, but Means to have raised a great Army, and have for some Time been Masters of half the Island of <HI>Britain.</HI> But Fate had other Events appointed, as well on one Side as on the other.</P>
<P>Now, to carry on the Face of a War in a Regu∣lar manner, the King, tho' more Forces could not yet be spared to <HI>Scotland,</HI> sent down thither the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> with the Honour of General of all the Forces in that Part of <HI>Great Britain</HI> call'd <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and Two Regiments of Foot and One of Dragoons were ordered to be sent from <HI>Ireland</HI> to Reinforce the Troops there; also the 6000 Men which were expected every Day from <HI>Holland,</HI> were determin'd to be sent thither. For, as for <HI>England</HI> it was resolved, that no Troops should be spared from thence yet, cost what it would.</P>
<P>All this while the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> went on streng∣thening himself in <HI>Scotland,</HI> extending his Quar∣ters, taking in Towns, and putting himself in a Posture for Action. And it must be confest, that notwithstanding his being disappointed in the Surprising the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> yet he had time enough as well to encrease his Army as to fortify his Post; which had he done, he had not been so ea∣sily forced, and might perhaps have made better Conditions for himself, and the unhappy Body that
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
attended him, when he found himself unable to resist any longer.</P>
<P>And this makes me more apt to give Credit to what the Lord <HI>Mar</HI> publish'd; <HI>(viz.)</HI> That he was not assisted from abroad as he expected, and as was reported. For this is most certain, that had he fortify'd the Town of <HI>Perth,</HI> as it was once said he had, with a Line, and five Bastions, and a double Counterscarp; I say, had he done this, and had been furnished with Artillery, and a Magazine of Ammunition for its Defence, the Royal Army either would not have attempted it in that desperate rigorous Season in which they did, or must have been ruin'd in the Attack; see∣ing it was impossible the Men could have born the vehemence of the Cold two Nights more than they did, in the open Field.</P>
<P>But it appear'd, they had only 4 Pieces of Can∣non in the whole Town, and not Ammunition enough to have serv'd the Cannon, which the De∣fence of such a Town requir'd, no not for Four Days; so that it is apparent, they abandon'd that Place meerly by the necessity of their Circumstan∣ces: Not for want of Men, but want of Means for a Defence.</P>
<P>To give the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> therefore his due, it is certain he made the best of it; he put a good Face upon every Thing; and having a visible Superiority of Forces, he pusht as far as lay in his Power; by which, and by all the other Circumstances of his Conduct, it appears, that he depended upon the Rising of other Parties in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> at the same Time.</P>
<P>He had, as is observed, taken <HI>Perth,</HI> which was indeed a great Blow to the publick Affairs; not only as it secured him the whole Country be∣hind,
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
but as it elevated the Spirits of his Men to expect greater Matters, gave Reputation to his Undertaking, and made him appear formidable abroad. Nor was it a little advantage to him in the main Article of raising Money; for now he laid all the Country between the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth</HI> and the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Tay,</HI> under Contribution.</P>
<P>By this Step he had Opportunity also to make some very successful Excursions; as particularly, that of <HI>Brunt-Island,</HI> which was an Affair very well foreseen, and very well executed; the Case was this: <Q>“About 400 small Arms, with Ammunition in Proportion, and several other Military Stores, were order'd by the Government out of the Magazine at <HI>Edinburgh-Castle,</HI> for the Use of the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> who was going to <HI>Dunrobin,</HI> in the No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, in order to raise a Force in the Rear of the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> as shall be seen in its” Course.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“These Arms and Warlike Stores were put on Board a Vessel belonging to <HI>Brunt-Island,</HI> a Town on the North-side of the <HI>Firth,</HI> directly opposite to <HI>Leith;</HI> and the Vessel being loaden, lay some Days for a fair Wind in <HI>Leith</HI> Road; but the Wind blowing hard at North-East, which makes a foul Road in the offing of <HI>Leith,</HI> the Master weighed, and stood over to the Shore of <HI>Fife</HI> near <HI>Brunt-Island,</HI> which was then the Weather-Shore: As the Ship was known in the Town, the Ma∣ster and Owners being all Inhabitants; so the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> got Intelligence of it, and of her” Loading also.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Immediately, upon this Advice, he made a Detachment of 400 Horse and 500 Foot, to seize this Booty; part of the Horse went before, carrying every Man a Footman behind him,
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
they order'd their March so, as to come to <HI>Brunt-Island</HI> in the middle of the Night, to pre∣vent any Boat going off the Ship to give her Notice to cut and be gone, or to the Men of War to come in to her Rescue: But by their entring in the Dark, they surpriz'd the Town; and immediately the Foot, knowing their Bu∣siness, seiz'd upon all the Boats upon the Shore, or in the Harbour, the Horse, in the mean time, surrounding the Town, to prevent any one go∣ing out to carry the News to other Parts, so as that any Boats might go off from <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> which” was a Town within two Miles.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Having thus seized upon the Boats, they em∣bark'd about 120 of their Men, and boarded the Ship, seiz'd and secur'd her without any Opposition; they weighed her Anchor, as some say, with Design to bring her into the Har∣bour; but the Tide not serving, they dropt the Anchor again, and fell to work with her Cargo; in short, they soon handed out the Arms and Stores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into their Boats; and pressing Carts and Horses in the Country round, they carried off their Booty the next Day, with∣out any Opposition. It seems this Detachment march'd so silently, or the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Spies, or Scouts, did their Duty so ill, that he had no Intelligence of their March till the next Day in the Afternoon, when the same Per∣sons that acquainted him of their March, assu∣red him of the Success of it, and that it was to no Purpose to attempt to intercept them in their Retreat, for that they were already gotten great Part of the Way; carrying their Booty, for their greater Safety, directly to <HI>Dundee:</HI> Tho' that Part of the Intelligence was wrong
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
too, if the rest of the Story be right; which was” this:</Q></P>
<P><Q>“That the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> not doubting but the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> would have Notice of their March, and would make a strong Detachment to intercept them in their Return, resolved to march in Person to a Town call'd <HI>Arva,</HI> within four or five Miles of <HI>Sterling,</HI> with 6000 Men, in order to alarm the Duke, and divert him from attempting to send any Detachment out to intercept his Men with their Booty; or that if such Detachment was made, then to face the Left, and cut of the Retreat off that Detach∣ment.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“This Stratagem took as well as he could wish; for the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> hearing that the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> was to be at <HI>Arva</HI> with a strong Detach∣ment that Night, the willinger laid aside his Design of sending a Party to intercept the Men that had the Booty, order'd out the Piquet, both of Horse and Foot, to fall upon the Rebels, and kept the rest of the Army under Arms all Day, to be ready to sustain them, if the Enemy” were too strong for them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> had done his Business; for the Booty being seized according to his De∣sire, and the Troops gone with it directly for <HI>Perth,</HI> and past Danger, he gave himself no Trouble to go to <HI>Arva,</HI> as was intended; but having amused the Royal Army with Expectati∣ons of an Action, he did his own Business with∣out any visible Difficulty; and the Duke's Men having found that no Enemy had been at <HI>Arva,</HI> or was to be heard of, retir'd to <HI>Sterling.</HI> These Things were done the second and third of <HI>Octo∣ber,”</HI> 1715.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117"/>
Thus far the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> went on with great Success, and his Party were hearten'd to a Degree greater than they themselves expected; and these Things had this particular Effect also; That it encouraged the march of their Friends from all Parts to join them; and Troops came to them eve∣ry Day; as particularly, they publish'd, That Brigadier <HI>Mackintosh</HI> joined him, the 5th of <HI>Octo∣ber,</HI> with 500 Men, almost all of them of the same Name. On the 6th, the Marquis of <HI>Huntley</HI> came in with 500 Horse and 2000 Foot. On the 10th, the Earl <HI>Marischal</HI> brought him 300 Horse, and 500 Foot, and abundance of Gentlemen a∣mong them. The Earl of <HI>Scaforth</HI> continued with 4000 Men, Horse and Foot, in the North, to face the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> who arm'd there for the King, having been sent by Sea thither for that Purpose, with Arms, Ammunition, and a Com∣mission for Raising Men.</P>
<P>Being thus encouraged, they rang'd over the whole Country, and lived at large for some time. The Accounts made publick at that Time, gave several Particulars of Ships coming daily in with Arms, Ammunition, Money, Officers, and Volun∣tiers; but as the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> positively denies that ever any such Ships came in, and that, as before, it appear'd plainly enough, that they never were supplied with either Cannon, Ammunition, or Arms, I cannot but think what the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> publish'd, was so far at least True.</P>
<P>Indeed, as they were now possess'd of near Two thirds of <HI>Scotland,</HI> their Friends, if they had any Interest abroad, had a fair Advantage to have push'd the Cause: But 'twas evident, the King's Interest, and the Vigilance of his Agents abroad, was such as effectually prevented any thing being

done for them: And even in <HI>France</HI> it self, what Attempts were made to supply them with Arms and Ammunition, Men and Money, was discou∣raged, and forbidden even by the Regent him∣self.</P>
<P>All this while the King's Army, which drew together at <HI>Sterling,</HI> under the Command of Ma∣jor-General <HI>Wightman,</HI> could not, with the addi∣tion of Two Regiments of Dragoons, make up full 1800 Men: And tho' there was some talk of a great Body of Western Highlanders coming in, yet they never came up; at least, not to any Action. However, this small Body kept the Rebels from passing the River <HI>Forth,</HI> and Ravaging the South of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as they would otherwise have done, but were not able, without extream Hazard, to do, as appeared afterwards. There was indeed another Bridge over the <HI>Forth,</HI> higher up the River, call'd the Bridge of <HI>Down;</HI> but this the King's Troops sent a strong Detachment to De∣molish and break down; which was accordingly done. And as for the Fords, they were all un∣passable at that Season, by Reason of the great Rains and Snows which fell continually for some Weeks together.</P>
<P>Thus Providence, and the Care of the General, kept the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> and his Army from coming over the <HI>Forth;</HI> which had they done, the Low∣lands of <HI>Clydsdale,</HI> and the City of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> with all the West Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> had been over-run by them, and they would have had an open Pas∣sage into <HI>England</HI> by the way of <HI>Drumfriesshire</HI> and <HI>Carlisle.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> ever be excused by his Party, either of want of Courage, or want of Conduct, that he being so strong as was reported,
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
<HI>(viz.)</HI> 10 or 12000 Men, and the King's Army not full 2000 Men, that he should not march and have forced his way at <HI>Sterling,</HI> or at <HI>Alloway,</HI> his own Hereditary Seat, where he might have ferried over his Army, the River being narrow enough, and might have driven the few Troops the King's Officers had there, either all into the Castle, where they must have perished for want, or have obliged them to Surrender. But it was not done; and indeed they did little more than sit still for several Months, and consume themselves, as will appear in the rest of the Sto∣ry.</P>
<P>It is true, the King's Men were entrench'd un∣der the Cannon of the Castle of <HI>Sterling,</HI> and the Bridge was easily defended: But on the other hand, the Enemy might have only fac'd the Bridge with one Part of their Army, while they had pass'd the River with the other, and they could not have met with any Disturbance, at that Time, from the Royal Army, their Number was so small: Nor durst they have divided their Troops for fear of the Bridge being attackt on one hand while they might have marcht to have obstructed the Landing on the other. The Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> therefore, can never be excused by his Friends, that he had not marcht with his whole Army while the Royal Army was so small; in which Case, had he past the <HI>Forth</HI> at <HI>Alloway,</HI> and marcht directly to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the City had been in no Condition to have shut her Gates against them. But the Saying of the Ancients was verified in them:</P>
<Q>Qui Jupiter Vult perdere hos dementat.</Q>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120"/>
I return now to the History of Fact. The Re∣bellion was now in its full Strength in the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> being, as I have said, fully possest of the whole Country North by <HI>Forth;</HI> and tho' the South Parts were not yet in his Hands, yet even they, were in a very un∣settled and precarious Condition: Even the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> it self, tho' the Sum of the affair consisted in their Safety, were yet without Arms, without Artillery, and without Troops to Cover and Defend them. The Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> indeed was sent down; and his very Presence, joined with his Authority, was a great Encouragement to the Citizens. But alas! he brought no Troops with him; not one Regiment; and bare Words would have gone but a little way with them, if the Enemy had appeared in any Numbers suffici∣ent to have forced them.</P>
<P>The Duke however did what he could, and, in particular, published an Order for the Encou∣raging of Voluntiers; of whom great Numbers were talk'd of, but few appear'd. However, that it might be seen the General did what lay in his Power, to bring them together, he published the following Order:</P>
<Q><P>John, <HI>Duke of</HI> Argyle, <HI>General and Commander in Chief of his Majesty's Forces in</HI> North-Britain, <HI>to the Lords Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants; and in their Absence, to the Well-affected Heritors in the Western and Southern Shires in</HI> Scotland, <HI>and in particular to the Justices of Peace, Magistrates of Burghs, and other Judges and Officers, Civil and Military.</HI></P></Q>
<P><Q>“WHHEREAS great Numbers of well-affected Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, in the
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
Southern and Western Shires of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being in readiness to march to such Places as they shall be appointed, may be desirous to have a par∣ticular Order for that Effect These are there∣fore, in his Majesty's Name, and by his Autho∣rity, requiring, ordering, and authorizing the Lord Lieutenants, Lieutenant-Deputies; or, in their Absence, all well affected Heritors, and each of them, in the Western and Southern Shires aforesaid, to march forthwith their sen∣cible Men, with their best Arms, and what Ammunition they have, and with Forty Days Provision, towards <HI>Glasgow;</HI> and to quarter there, or in the adjacent Towns or Villages on the North-side of the River <HI>Clyde,</HI> in order to be ready to assist in the opposing and extin∣guishing the Rebellion, now rais'd against our Laws, our Liberties, and the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religi∣on. Given at our Camp at <HI>Stirling,</HI> the 2d of” <HI>October,</HI> 1715.</Q></P>
<P>ARGYLE.</P>
<P>But as the Duke found few come in, and the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and the Voluntiers which were assembled at <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh,</HI> (his Lordship's House) were obliged to abandon it, and disperse again; the Duke plainly saw that nothing but regular Disci∣plin'd Forces could do the Work, and wrote at large to the King, to lay before his Majesty the Necessity of sending speedy Succours.</P>
<P>But all that the Court could do at that time, was to assure him, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops, which were expected every hour, should be dispatch'd to <HI>Scotland</HI> as soon as they arrived. The Duke then apply'd himself to raise Men there by Beat of Drum, to fill up the Companies who were up∣on
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
the old Foot, and to raise each Company to 50 Men each; but this did not answer the End any more than the other, the Drum bringing in very few Voluntiers.</P>
<P>The Sword of War being now drawn, the Votes and Speeches of Parliament began to De∣crease, and the Houses drawing their Business to a Crose, all Things tended to a Recess.</P>
<P>In order to this, the King came to the House the 21st of <HI>September,</HI> when the Speaker present∣ed the Money Bills, he made a Speech to the King, which, for Brevity's sake, I omit. After the Speaker had presented his Bills, the King gave the Royal Assent to the following publick Acts:</P>
<P N="1">1. An Act to enable his Majesty to settle a Revenue upon her Royal Highness.</P>
<P N="2">2. An Act for enlarging the capital Stock, and yearly Fund of the <HI>South-Sea Company.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. An Act for making Provision for the Mini∣sters of the Fifty New Churches.</P>
<P N="4">4. An Act for preventing Disturbances by Sea-Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. An Act for appointing Commissioners for examining Debts due to the Army.</P>
<P N="6">6. An Act for stating the Debts due to <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Equivalent.</P>

<P N="8">8. An Act concerning the <HI>Yule vacance</HI> in <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. An Act for allowing a Time for the <HI>Pala∣tines,</HI> who were settled in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to take the Oaths.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="122" REF="123"/>
10. An Act to make the River <HI>Kennet</HI> naviga∣ble.</P>
<P N="11">11. An Act for repairing the High-ways be∣tween <HI>Tyburn</HI> and <HI>Uxbridge.</HI></P>
<P>And to <HI>Seven</HI> private Acts; and then his Ma∣jesty made a Speech to them, which was read by the Lord Chancellor, and is as fol∣lows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“I Am perswaded you are all by this time very desirous of some Recess; and that it cannot be deferr'd longer, without great Inconveniency” to your private Affairs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But before I can part with you, I must return you my most sincere Thanks for your having fi∣nish'd, with so much Wisdom and Unanimity, what I recommended to your Care: And par∣cularly I must thank you, <HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</HI> for the Provision you have made, as well for the Support of the Honour and Dig∣nity of the Crown, as for the other necessary Occasions of the Publick; especially for your having done it by Means so little burdensome to my People; which, I assure you, recommends the Supplies to me above any other Circumstance” whatsoever.</Q></P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“The open and declared Rebellion, which is now actually begun in <HI>Scotland,</HI> must convince all, who do not wish to see us given up into the Hands of a <HI>Popish Pretender,</HI> of the Dangers to” which we have been, and are still expos'd.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124"/>
<Q>“I thought it incumbent upon me, to give you the earliest Notice of the Designs of our Ene∣mies; and I cannot sufficiently commend the Zeal and Dispatch with which you empower'd me, at a Time when the Nation was in so na∣ked and defenceless a Condition, to make such Preparations as I should think necessary for our Security. You shall have no Reason to repent of the Trust and Confidence you repose in me, which I shall never use to any other End, than for the Protection and Welfare of my” People.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It was scarce to be imagined, That any of my <HI>Protestant</HI> Subjects, who have known and enjoyed the Benefits of our excellent Constitu∣tion, and have heard of the great Dangers they were wonderfully deliver'd from by the happy Revolution, should, by any Arts and Management, be drawn into Measures that must at once destroy their Religion and Liberties, and subject them to Popery and arbitrary Power; but such has been our Misfortune, that too ma∣ny of my People have been deluded, and made instrumental to the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Designs, who had never dared to think of invading us, or raising a Rebellion, had he not been encouraged by the Success his Emissaries and Adherents have already had, in stirring up Riots and Tumults, and by the further Hopes they entertain, of raising Insurrections in many Parts of my King∣doms.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The endeavouring to perswade my People, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> is in Danger under my Government, has been the main Artifice employed in carrying on this wicked and trai∣terous Design. This Insinuation, after the so∣lemn
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
Assurances I have given; and my having laid hold on all Opportunities to do every Thing that may tend to the Advantage of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> is both unjust and ungrateful: Nor can I believe so groundless and malicious a Ca∣lumny can make any Impression upon the Minds of my faithful Subjects; or that they can be so far misled, as to think the Church of <HI>England</HI> is to be secur'd by setting a <HI>Popish Pretender</HI> on the” Throne.</Q></P>
<P><HI>My Lord, and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“The Proofs this Parliament has given of their unshaken Duty and Affection to me, and of their Love and Zeal for the Interest of their Coun∣try, will recommend you to the good Opinion and Esteem of all, who have their Religion and Liberty truly at Heart, and has laid a lasting Obligation upon me; and I question not but by your further Assistance in the several Countries to which you are going, with the Blessing of Almighty God, who has so frequently inter∣posed in Favour of this Nation, I shall be able to disappoint and defeat the Designs of our E∣nemies.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Our Meeting again to do Business early in the next Winter, will be useful on many Ac∣counts; particularly, that the Sitting of Parlia∣ments may be again brought into that Season of the Year which is most convenient; and that as little Delay may be given as is possible to your judicial Proceedings; and I shall at present give such Orders to my Lord Chancellor, as may not put it long out of my Power to meet you on any” sudden Occasion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="126"/>
After this Speech, the Houses were order'd to adjourn themselves to the 6th of <HI>October;</HI> from whence, by farther Adjournments, they had a Recess to the 14th of <HI>December,</HI> when, by Procla∣mation, they had Notice to sit again to do Busi∣ness, as we shall see in its Place.</P>
<P>It began now to appear, by the Face of Affairs in <HI>England,</HI> that the Heart of the Rebellion was broken, and that not by the King's Forces; for there had been no Action yet, in which the King's Interest had not been rather Loser than Gainer, except that of the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> But the breaking the Measures of those who had lay'd their Schemes for making the Rebellion General, or rather Universal, this, I say, was a Great Blow given to the Interest, and did more than over∣throwing the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> and all his Army would have done.</P>
<P>The Surprising Sir <HI>William Wyndham,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> of Coomb, who endeavour'd to de∣stroy himself by stabbing himself into the Body; the Dispersing the Gentlemen at the <HI>Bath,</HI> and seizing their Arms; the crushing the Correspon∣dences at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and in a word, posting Soldi∣ers in every Corner of the Kingdom, so that no∣thing could stir. These were the Disappoint∣ments; these were the Blows that wounded the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> tho' at a great Distance, in the most sensible Part, and which in effect Overthrew the whole Undertaking: For it is evident, the main Dependance of the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> and his whole Army, was not that they were able fight or grap∣ple with the King's whole Power; but that they expected the whole Party should rise throughout the Kingdom, and should so divide the Royal
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
Forces as that he should be able to do his Work without being obliged to fight with a Superior Number of Troops before he was ready to en∣gage them.</P>
<P>This the Government was aware of, and this was the most essential Point the Ministry had to guard against; and which was so effectually done, that nothing could stir in the remotest Cor∣ner, but the King had Troops at hand to attack and suppress it, even in its Bud, in its Infancy; as was the Case at the <HI>Bath,</HI> at <HI>Bristol,</HI> at <HI>Shrews∣bury,</HI> at <HI>Excester,</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> at <HI>Manchester,</HI> at <HI>Ox∣ford,</HI> and several other Places, where the Common People shew'd their Dispositions to Revolt.</P>
<P>The North seem'd the only Place where the Rebellion, being gotten to a Head, requir'd more Troops to reduce it than could be spar'd at that time, from the other more Necessary Work of se∣curing the more dangerous Parts of the Kingdom. And this Place being so remote, there appear'd less Hazard in letting them go on a while without being formally attackt, than would have been in other Places; and therefore, they were suffered, for a while, to Range about the Country, and do a World of Mischief, more than they would otherwise have been permitted to do, Unfought with.</P>
<P>This Relates, particularly, to the Rising of Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> and his Party, in <HI>Northumberland;</HI> the Rising of the Earl of <HI>Kenmure</HI> and his Party, in the West of <HI>Scotland;</HI> the Landing of Brigadier <HI>Mac∣kintosh</HI> on the South-side of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> And these 3 Bodies joining together afterwards up∣on the Borders, and Marching into <HI>England;</HI> which makes together the Second main Branch of the Rebellion; an Abstract of whose Story I have re∣serv'd
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
for this Place, that it may come as whole together as I can, and the Reader may not lose himself in the frequent Interruptions of the Rela∣tion.</P>
<P>There had been some Measures concerted at <HI>London</HI> for this Rising, some time before it broke out; to which Capt, <HI>John Shafloe,</HI> a Half-pay Officer, since executed at <HI>Preston,</HI> and Capt. <HI>John Hunter</HI> of <HI>North-Tyne,</HI> in the County of <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> who had a Commission from Queen <HI>Anne</HI> to raise an independant Company, but did not, assisted: Besides these two, there was one Captain <HI>Robert Talbot,</HI> an <HI>Irishman,</HI> formerly in the <HI>French</HI> Service, who likewise being ac∣quainted with the Design in <HI>August,</HI> 1715, took Shipping at <HI>London,</HI> and went to <HI>Newcastle.</HI> By this Gentleman, the Resolutions taken at <HI>London</HI> were first communicated to their Friends in the North of <HI>England,</HI> and Means used to persuade and prepare the Gentlemen they had embark'd with them, to be ready to rise upon Warning given. Other principal Men entrusted with these Negotiations, were, Colonel <HI>Oxburgh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nich. Wogan,</HI> Mr. <HI>Charles Wogan,</HI> and Mr. <HI>James Talbot,</HI> all <HI>Irish</HI> Gentlemen: A second Class of Agents consisted of Mr. <HI>Clifton,</HI> Brother to Sir <HI>Gervase Clifton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Beaumont,</HI> both Gentlemen of <HI>Nottinghamshire,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Buxton</HI> a Clergyman of <HI>Derbyshire.</HI> All these rid like Gentlemen, with Servants and Attendants, and were arm'd with Sword and Pistols. They kept always moving, and travelled from Place to Place, till Things ri∣pened for Action. The first Step towards their appearing in Arms, was, when, about the latter end of <HI>September,</HI> the Lord <HI>Derwentwater</HI> and Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> had notice that there was a Warrant out
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
from the Secretary of State to apprehend them, and that the Messengers were come to <HI>Durham</HI> that were to take them.</P>
<P>Upon this News, they had a full Meeting of the Parties concern'd, in <HI>Northumberland;</HI> where consulting all the Circumstances of their Friends, and of the Interest they were embark'd in, they boldly resolv'd, That since there was no Safety any longer in shifting from Place to Place; but that in a few Days they should be all secur'd, and clapp'd up in several Prisons, or hurried away to <HI>London;</HI> where as they should be severally confin'd, so they would be severally examined, and none could say what the other should answer: So that for fear of betraying one another, they should be really brought to do it; That now was the time to shew their Loyalty to their King <HI>(Pretender,)</HI> and that if this Opportunity was lost, they had no room to hope for another; and that therefore they would immediately appear in Arms.</P>
<P>Pursuant to this Resolution, an Appointment was made, and Notice of it sent to all their Friends, to meet the next Morning, which was the 6th of <HI>October,</HI> at a Place called <HI>Green-rig,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Forster,</HI> with about Twenty Gentle∣men, met as at the Rendezvous; they made no stay there, thinking the Place inconvenient, but rode immediately to the top of a Hill called the <HI>Waterfalls;</HI> from whence they might discover any that came either to join them, or to oppose them. They had not been long here, before they disco∣vered the Earl of <HI>Derwentwater,</HI> who came that Morning from his own Seat at <HI>Dilston,</HI> with some Friends, and all his Servants, very well mounted and arm'd. They were now near 60 Horse, most Gentlemen and their Attendants; when, calling a
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
short Council, it was concluded to march towards the River <HI>Coquett,</HI> to a Place called <HI>Plainfield:</HI> Here they were join'd by others, who came strag∣gling in, and having made some stay here, they resolved to go that Night to <HI>Rothbury,</HI> a small Market-Town: Here they stay'd all Night; and next Morning, being the 7th of <HI>October,</HI> their Number still encreasing, they marched to <HI>Wark∣worth,</HI> another Market-Town upon the Sea-coast, and strong by its Situation, famous formerly for a Castle, the Body of which still remains, and an ancient Cell cut out of a solid Rock: Here they continued till <HI>Monday;</HI> during which time, no∣thing material happened, except that on <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning Mr. <HI>Forster,</HI> who now stiled himself Ge∣neral, sent Mr. <HI>Buxton</HI> their Chaplain to Mr. <HI>Ion</HI> the Parson of the Parish, with Orders for him <HI>to Pray for the</HI> Pretender <HI>as King; and in the Litany, for</HI> Mary <HI>Queen-Mother, and all the dutiful Branches of the Royal Family;</HI> and to omit the usual Names of <HI>King</HI> George, <HI>the Prince and Princess;</HI> which Mr. <HI>Ion</HI> declining, the other, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Bux∣ton,</HI> did it for him. The next thing they did, was openly to Proclaim the <HI>Pretender</HI> as King of <HI>Great Britain, &amp;c.</HI> It was done by Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> in Disguise; and by the sound of Trumpet, and with all the Formality that the Circumstances and Place would admit. It may be observed, that this was the first Place where the <HI>Pretender</HI> was so avowed∣ly Pray'd for and Proclaimed as King of these Realms.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the 10th of <HI>October,</HI> they marched to <HI>Morpeth,</HI> where their Number got a considera∣ble Addition: At <HI>Felton-Bridge</HI> they were joined by 70 <HI>Scots</HI> Horse, or rather Gentlemen, from the Borders; and they had been considerably encreas∣ed
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
before, in their March from <HI>Warkworth,</HI> at <HI>Alnwick,</HI> and other Places; so that at their en∣tring this Town they were 300 strong, all Horse; for they would entertain no Foot, else their Num∣ber would have been very large: But as they neither had nor could provide Arms for those they had mounted, they gave the Common People good Words, and told them that they would soon be furnished with Arms and Ammunition, and that then they would List Regiments to form an Army: This was upon the Expectation they had of surprising <HI>Newcastle;</HI> in which case, they did not question to have had as many Foot as they pleas'd. Here Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> received an Account that Mr. <HI>Lancelot Errington,</HI> and some others, had surprized the Castle in <HI>Holy Island;</HI> which is a small Fort guarded by a few Soldiers sent Weekly from the Garrison at <HI>Berwick. Errington,</HI> undisco∣vered, took Boat, and went to Sea, and with his Companions landed under the Cover of the Wall, and got into the Fort by Surprize; though he kept the Possession but a very little while, for the Go∣vernor of <HI>Berwick</HI> having an immediate Account of the Action, and resolving, if possible, to reco∣ver the Place before <HI>Errington</HI> could be supply'd with Men and Provisions, detach'd a Party of 30 Men of his Garrison, with about 50 Voluntiers of the Inhabitants, and marching over the Sands at Low-water-mark, attack'd the Fort, and took it Sword in hand; <HI>Errington</HI> himself attempting to make his Escape, was wounded, and taken Prison∣er, with several others. <HI>N. B.</HI> He with his Brother, afterwards got out of <HI>Berwick</HI> in Disguise. The Design of taking this Fort was, to give Signals to any Ships that seem'd to make to the Coast to land
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
Soldiers; for by the Assurances they had from Friends beyond Sea, they expected them to land on that Coast with Supplies of Arms and Offi∣cers; but they never came till they were gone for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and then 2 Ships, as it is said, appeared off at Sea, and made their Signal; but having no An∣swer from the Shore, made sail Northward. The Rebellion was now formed, and they were all in a Body at <HI>Morpeth,</HI> promising themselves great Things at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> also several Gentlemen join∣ed them there, and several of the Country People came in, and offer'd to List; but they still de∣clined them, and prepared to march to <HI>Newcastle;</HI> and here also they Proclaimed the <HI>Pretender.</HI> Here it was that they receiv'd their first Disappoint∣ment, <HI>(viz.)</HI> in the Affair of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which they expected should open its Gates to them; whereupon they changed their Course, and Marched to <HI>Hexham,</HI> a Pass upon the River <HI>Tyne:</HI> Here they were joined by some more <HI>Scots</HI> Horse. From this Town they all march'd, few or none knowing whither, and went three Miles distant to a Heath or Moor adjoining to <HI>Dilston,</HI> the Seat of the Lord <HI>Derwentwater,</HI> and there they made a Halt; this was with Design, as was thought, to go back to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which Town they still had some Hopes of Surprising; but being afterwards fully informed, that their Measures for Surprising the Town were quite broken, they went back again to <HI>Hexham,</HI> where they staid but three Days, tho' they were not idle during that time; for first they seized all the Arms and Horses they could lay they Hands on Next, here their Chaplain again went to the Minister of the Town, and desired him or his Curate to read Prayers, commanding that in them he should mention the <HI>Pretender</HI> by Name,
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
as King <HI>James</HI> III. The Minister modestly de∣clined it; so Mr. <HI>Buxton</HI> officiated, and perform∣ed as usual. The Night before they left the Town, they were all drawn round the <HI>Cross</HI> in the Market-place, where the <HI>Pretender</HI> was Pro∣claimed, and the Proclamation fixed to the <HI>Cross;</HI> which remain'd there several Days after they were gone; which, some say, is an Evidence of that Town's good Inclination to one side or other. Here they had notice of the Vis∣count <HI>Kenmure,</HI> Earls of <HI>Nithsdale, Carnwath,</HI> and <HI>Wintoun,</HI> who had taken Arms in <HI>Nithsdale, Dumfreisshire,</HI> and other Places in the West of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> having entred <HI>England</HI> to join them, and that they were come to <HI>Rothbury.</HI> The Viscount <HI>Ken∣mure,</HI> the only Nobleman in that part of <HI>Scotland</HI> capable of commanding Forces upon that Account, set up the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Standard at a small Town in <HI>Annandale</HI> called <HI>Mophet.</HI> This Standard, suppo∣sed to be made by his Lady, was very handsome, one side being Blue, with the <HI>Scot</HI>'s Arms done in Gold; the other side a Thistle, with this under, <HI>No Union;</HI> above the Thistle, the usual Motto, <HI>Nemo me impune lacesset.</HI> This Standard had Pen∣dants of white Ribbon; upon one of these was written, <HI>For our Wronged King, and Oppressed Coun∣try;</HI> the other Ribbon had thereon, <HI>For our Lives and Liberties.</HI> This Standard was set up the first Night they made their Appearance. Being late, next Day being the 13th of <HI>October</HI> they marched towards <HI>Dumfreis,</HI> with a Design to surprize that Town; but the Marquis of <HI>Annandale,</HI> whom they had followed the Day before, having none but his Servants along with him, entred the Town, and concerted such Measures as made that Design
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
abortive; which obliged them to alter their Rout, tho' many Disputes happen'd hereupon, but at last they agreed to march to <HI>Loughmaben</HI> that Night, where next Day they set up their Standard again, and proclaimed the <HI>Pretender.</HI> This Town was the first Place, on this side the <HI>Forth</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the <HI>Pretender</HI> was proclaimed, and his Stan∣dard set up. That Day the Standard was carried by <HI>John Dalziel</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Brother to the Earl of <HI>Carn∣wath.</HI> On the 14th of this Month they march'd to <HI>Achelfechen.</HI> On their March thither, on a Common, being in all near 200 Horse, they were formed into a Regiment, divided into two Squa∣drons. The chief Command to Viscount <HI>Ken∣mure,</HI> that of each Squadron to the Earls of <HI>Win∣toun</HI> and <HI>Carnwath.</HI> Hence they marched regular∣ly, and sent their Quarter-Master-General Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI> to take up Quarters for them. Next Day they continued their March to <HI>Langholm,</HI> be∣having themselves all along Civil in their Quar∣ters. From thence they continued their Rout to <HI>Hawick.</HI> Upon these Marches their Number en∣creased. At this Place they were alarm'd, which raised some Disputes whether they should proceed. They agreed to return, but had an Express from Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> about two Miles from <HI>Hawick,</HI> towards <HI>Langholm.</HI> This Messenger, Mr. <HI>Duglass,</HI> had an Invitation from the <HI>Northumberland</HI> General to my Lord <HI>Kenmure</HI> and his Followers, to meet him at <HI>Rothbury:</HI> So they faced about, and marched that Night to <HI>Jedburgh.</HI> Here they received In∣telligence of the <HI>Mackintosh</HI>'s crossing the <HI>Forth,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Resolution to attack them; which put them into mighty Pain how the Consequence would prove. It is to be observed,
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
that they were alarmed in marching to <HI>Jedburgh;</HI> Being late, their Advance Guard was surpriz'd by the Shouts of one who called out, That the Grey Horse were ready to fall on them, and had cut the Quarter-Master and those with him into pieces. Those acquainted with the Quarter-Ma∣ster assured Lord <HI>Kenmure,</HI> that he would by no means be so easily ensnar'd, being better used to Military Affairs; so they continued their March, and entred the Town without Opposition. Here, as in most other Towns, they proclaimed the <HI>Pretender;</HI> next Morning proceeded to <HI>Rothbury,</HI> perhaps such a March as few People are acquaint∣ed with, being very mountain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, long, tedious, and marshy. From <HI>Rothbury</HI> they dispatch'd Mr. <HI>Burnett</HI> of <HI>Carlips</HI> to <HI>Hexam,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Forster,</HI> to know his Mind, Whether he would come towards them, or they should advance? He returned an Express, that he would join them, and according∣ly prepared to march; and the rather, because they heard from <HI>Newcastle,</HI> that General <HI>Carpenter</HI> was preparing to attack them They left <HI>Hexham</HI> on <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 19th of <HI>October,</HI> and making a long March, they joined the Lord <HI>Kenmure</HI> that Night; and both of them next Day march'd to <HI>Wooler,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Northumberland.</HI> Here Mr. <HI>Errington</HI> brought them an Account of the Highlanders being also coming to join them, and that they were advanced to <HI>Dunse,</HI> of which a full Account has been given already. On this News they march'd for <HI>Kelso</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI> On this Day's March they seiz'd several Horses, and made Mr. <HI>Selbye,</HI> a Gentleman of that Country, Prisoner. A little before they came to <HI>Kelso,</HI> they made a Halt upon a Moor; and there the Gentlemen formed
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
into Troops, were drawn out by themselves, and called over; not only by their Names, but by their design'd Offices for the several Troops: And it is to be observed, that to each Troop they as∣signed Two Captains, being the only way they had to oblige so many Gentlemen. Next Morn∣ing the Highlanders were drawn up in the Church∣yard, and so march'd in Order to the Market∣place, with Colours flying, Drums beating, and Bag-pipes playing, and there formed a Circle, the Lords and other Gentlemen standing in the Centre: There was an inner Circle formed also by the Gentlemen Voluntiers. Then Silence being enjoined, the Trumpet sounded; after which the <HI>Pretender</HI> was proclaimed by one <HI>Sea∣ton Barns,</HI> who assum'd the Title of Earl of <HI>Dumferling.</HI> The Proclamation was to this Ef∣fect:</P>
<P><Q>“Whereas by the Decease of the late King <HI>James</HI> the VIIth, the Imperial Crowns of these Realms did lineally descend to his lawful Heir and Son our Sovereign <HI>James</HI> the VIIIth: We the Lords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do declare him our lawful King” over <HI>Scotland, England,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Then was read the following <HI>Manifesto</HI> of the Earl of <HI>Mar.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="136" REF="137"/>
<P><HI>MANIFESTO by the Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, who dutifully appear at this Time in asserting the undoubted Right of their lawful So∣vereign</HI> James VIII. <HI>by the Grace of God, King of</HI> Scotland, England, France, <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>Defen∣der of the Faith,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and for relieving this his an∣cient Kingdom from the Oppressions and Grievances it lies under.</HI></P></Q>
<P><Q>“HIS Majesty's Right of Blood to the Crowns of these Realms is undoubted, and has never been disputed or arraign'd by the least” Circumstance of lawful Authority.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“By the Laws of God, by the ancient Consti∣tutions, and by the positive unrepeal'd Laws of the Land, we are bound to pay his Majesty the Duty of Loyal Subjects. Nothing can ab∣solve us from this our Duty of Subjection and Obedience; the Laws of God require our Al∣legiance to our rightful King; the Laws of the Land secure our Religion and other Interests; and his Majesty giving up himself to the Sup∣port of his Protestants Subjects, puts the Means of securing to us our Concerns Religious and” Civil in our own Hands.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Our Fundamental Constitution has been en∣tirely altered and sunk amidst the various Shocks of unstable Faction; while in the searching out new Expedients pretended for our Security, it has produced nothing but daily Disappoint∣ments, and has brought us and our Posterity un∣der a precarious Dependance upon foreign Councils and Interests, and the Power of foreign” Troops.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="138"/>
<Q>“The late unhappy Union, which was brought about by the mistaken Notions of some, and the ruinous and selfish Designs of others, has prov'd so far from lessening and healing the Differences betwixt his Majesty's Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> that it has widened and increased them; and it appears by Experience so inconsistent with the Rights, Privileges, and Interests of us and our good Neighbours and Fellow-Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> that the Continu∣ance of it must inevitably ruin us, and hurt them. Nor can any Way be found out to relieve us, and restore our ancient and independent Constitution, but by restoring our rightful and natural King, who has the only undoubted Right to reign over us: Neither can we hope that the Party who chiefly contribute to bring us into Bondage, will at any time endeavour to work our Relief; since it is known how strenu∣ously they opposed, in Two late Instances, the Efforts that were made by all <HI>Scotsmen</HI> by them∣selves, and supported by the best and wisest of the <HI>English,</HI> towards so desirable an End, as they will not adventure openly to disown the Disso∣lution” of the Union to be.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Our Substance has been wasted in the late ruinous Wars; and we see an unavoidable Pros∣pect of having Wars continued on us and our Posterity, so long as the Possession of the Crown” is not in the right Line.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Hereditary Rights of the Subjects, tho' confirm'd by Conventions and Parliaments, are now treated as of no Value or Force; and past Service to the Crown and Royal Family, are” now look'd upon as Grounds of Suspicion.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="139"/>
<Q>“A pack'd up Assembly, who call themselves a <HI>British Parliament,</HI> have, as far as in them lies, inhumanly murder'd their own and our So∣vereign, by promising a great Sum of Money as” the Reward of so execrable a Crime.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“They have proscribed, by unaccountable and groundless Impeachments and Attainders, the worthy Patriots of <HI>England,</HI> for their ho∣nourable and successful Endeavours to restore Trade, Plenty, and Peace, to these Nati∣ons.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“They have broken in upon the Laws of both Countries, by which the Liberty of our Persons was secured; they have empower'd a Foreign Prince (who notwithstanding his Expectation of the Crown for 15 Years, is still unacquainted with our Manners, Customs, and Language) to make an absolute Conquest (if not timely prevented) of the Three Kingdoms, by invest∣ing himself with an unlimited Power, not only of raising unnecessary Forces at Home, but also of calling in Foreign Troops, ready to promote his uncontroulable Designs: Nor can we be ever hopeful of its being otherwise, in the Way it is in at present, for some Generations to come; and the sad Consequences of these un∣exampled Proceedings have really been so fatal to great Numbers of our Kinsmen, Friends, and Fellow-Subjects of both Kingdoms, that they have been constrain'd to abandon their Country, Houses, Wives, and Children, or give themselves up Prisoners, and perhaps Victims to be sacrificed at the Pleasure of Foreigners, and a few hot-headed Men of a restless Faction” whom they employ.</Q></P>

<Q>“Our Troops Abroad, notwithstanding of their long and remarkable good Services, have been treated, since the Peace, with Neglect and Contempt, and particularly in <HI>Holland;</HI> and it is not now the Officers long Service, Merit, and Blood they have lost, but Money and Favour, by which they can obtain Justice in their Pre∣ferments; so that it is evident the Safety of his Majesty's Person, and Independency of his Kingdoms, call loudly for immediate Relief and” Defence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Consideration of these unhappy Circum∣stances, with the due Regard we have to com∣mon Justice, the Peace and Quiet to us and our Posterity, and our Duty to his Majesty and his Commands, are powerful Motives that have engaged us in our present Undertakings, which we are firmly and heartily resolved to push to the utmost, and stand by one another to the last Exrtemity, as the only solid and effectual Means of putting an End to so dreadful a Prospect, as by our present Situation we have before our Eyes; And with faithful Hearts, true to our only rightful King, our Country, and our Neigh∣bours, we earnestly beseech and expect (as his Majesty's Commands) the Assistance of all our true Fellow-Subjects, to second this our first Attempt; declaring hereby our sincere Inten∣tions, That we will promote and concur, in all lawful Means, for settling a lasting Peace to these Lands, under the auspicious Govern∣ment of our native-born rightful Sovereign, the Direction of our Domestick Councils, and the Protection of our Native Forces and” Troops.</Q></P>

Nor have we any Reason to be distrustful of the Goodness of God, the Truth and Purity of our Holy Religion, or the known Excellency of his Majesty's Judg∣ment, as not to hope that in due Time, good Example and Conversation with our learned Divines, will remove these Prejudices, which we know his Education in a Popish Country has not rivetted in his discerning Mind; and we are sure, a Justice is a Vertue in all Religions and Professions, so the doing of it to him, will” not lessen his good Opinion of ours.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“That we will use our utmost Endeavours for redressing the bad Usage of our Troops Abroad, and bringing the Troops at Home to be on the same Foot and Establishment of Pay as those of” <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>

<P><Q>“The Peace of these Nations being thus settled, and we thus freed from Foreign Dangers, we will use our Endeavours to have the Army re∣duced to the usual Number of Guards and Gar∣risons; and will concur in such Laws and Me∣thods as shall relieve us of the heavy Taxes and Debts now lying upon us, and at the same time will support the Publick Credit in all its” Parts.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“And we do hereby promise and engage, That every Officer who joins with us in our King and Country's Cause, shall not only enjoy the Post he now does, but shall be advanced and preferr'd according to his Rank and Station, and the Number of Men he brings off with him to us; and each Foot-Soldier so joining with us, shall have Twenty Shillings sterling; and each Trooper or Dragoon, who brings Horse and Accoutrements along with him, Twelve Pounds sterling Gratuity, besides their” Pay.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“And in general, we shall concur with all our Fellow-Subjects in such Measures as shall make us flourish at Home, and be formidable Abroad, under our rightful Sovereign, and the peaceful Harmony of our ancient fundamental Consti∣tution, undisturbed by a <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Interests and Councils from Abroad, or a restless Faction at” Home.</Q></P>

and our Country, from sinking under Oppres∣sion.”</Q></P>
<P>This <HI>Manifesto</HI> being ended, the People with loud Acclamations shouted, <HI>NO Union! NO Malt, NO Salt-TAX!</HI> Then the Highlanders returned to their Quarters, where they continued till <HI>Thursday.</HI></P>
<P>Matters were now run their full Length; and the King, who began now to appear more than Equal to all the Attempts that could be made against his Government, had Troops ready to engage them in every Place. <HI>N. B.</HI> The same Day the Attack was made at <HI>Preston,</HI> that very Day the Two Armies in <HI>Scotland</HI> came to a pitch'd Battle.</P>
<P>As for those at <HI>Preston,</HI> their whole Conduct secur'd their Overthrow: And they might easily have seen from the beginning, that they were never in any Condition to resist the attack of Regular Troops; that they had neither Men disciplin'd, Officers experienced, or Magazines furnished; and which was more than all, no Subordination, no Subjection, no command among them. So that indeed they were rather a Crowd than an Army; and they could not without a Madness next to that of Desparation, have marcht, as they did, into the Heart of the Country, where they were sure to be surrounded, and to have no Possibility left them of escaping. But their Fate hurry'd them on, and there was no preventing it, as shall be seen in the farther relation of these things.</P>
<P>I return to the Progress of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Circumstances now appear'd very Encouraging indeed. He had with him, as they
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
reported, near 12000 Men, well appointed, bold and resolute for Action: Indeed they had need to be so, for they were imbark'd in an Underta∣king full of Terrors, which requir'd not Courage only, but even the Rage of Despair to carry it on.</P>
<P>They had long talk'd of marching Southward, passing the <HI>Forth,</HI> attacking the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and the like; and the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> who knew very well the Courage of his Men, as well as the Reputation of his Undertaking, could not but be upheld by lying still, finding he was now joined by most of the Troops that he expected, resolv'd to march, and accordingly caused the Army to Rendezvous at a small Town call'd <HI>Auchterarder,</HI> near <HI>Perth,</HI> at once to amuse the King's Ar∣my, and execute his Design; He had all the Reason in the World to attempt this now, because the King's Troops were still very weak, all the Men the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> having yet with him, not exceeding 1500 Men, besides a few Volun∣tiers, which at best never were above 200 at a time; nor were they above 100 at the Battle of <HI>Sherriffmuir.</HI> The Particulars of that Force, to explain this more fully, was thus set forth even at that time.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Some Regiments having a little before been sent to <HI>Ireland,</HI> all the Troops left in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at the breaking out of the Rebellion, were no more than the Regiments of Dragoons of <HI>Portmore</HI> and <HI>Stair;</HI> the latter call'd the <HI>White-Horses;</HI> and the Regiments of Foot of <HI>Shannon, Montague, Grant, Wightman, Orrery, Irwin,</HI> and <HI>Forfar;</HI> all which when together, some Detachments being made for Garrisons at <HI>Inverlochy</HI> and <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> made up 1850 Men; and were afterwards rein∣forc'd
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
from <HI>Ireland</HI> with <HI>Evan</HI>'s Dragoons, <HI>Clay∣ton</HI>'s and <HI>Morison</HI>'s Regiment of Foot, making to∣gether about 850 Men more: There was indeed a great Appearance of the Nobility and Gentry, and great Talk of a large Number of Voluntiers from <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and the <HI>West;</HI> the former indeed made up a handsome Body of about 150 Horse, all Persons of Distinction, and appear'd forward enough for Service; but of the latter we do not find, whatever Shew they made, that they ever came to any Action.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> therefore, whose Troops were now hearty and numerous, far Superior to the King's Army, found that now was his time to enter upon Action, and to attack the King's For∣ces, if possible; or if not; to amuse them, and pass the <HI>Forth,</HI> that he might succour and join his Friends in the South, and so push on the Grand Design before his Enemies were strengthen'd with more Forces.</P>
<P>With this Resolution he drew his Army toge∣ther, and advanc'd with a Body of his Men to have a nearer View of the Situation of the Duke of <HI>Argyle;</HI> but finding he lay with his little Army, under the Cannon of <HI>Sterling,</HI> the River in his Front, and no Passage but at the Bridge, which the Castle commanded; that on the other hand, he was not provided with Boats for a Passage, or with Materials for a Bridge, or time for building it; in a word, finding an Attempt there Impracticable, he resolv'd upon sending over a Body of Foot lower down, where the Passage indeed was more difficult and dangerous, but where there were no Troops to oppose him, and where he should sooner bring his Men to Action with more Advantage: This being resolv'd on; the Place he pitch'd up∣on
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
was towards the Mouth of the <HI>Forth,</HI> where the Sea was no less than Ten or Twelve Miles over.</P>
<P>Though this was a hazardous Enterprize, there being several Men of War in the <HI>Firth;</HI> yet he both undertook and perform'd it with Success; and had he sent over 5000 Men instead of 2000, he had done his Business; for the Forces at hand to oppose him, was no way able to have with∣stood him; but he began his own way, and for what he did it was well enough managed: For having secretly caused all the Boats on the Coast to be seiz'd and secur'd, he sent Brigadier <HI>Mac∣kintosh,</HI> a bold and soldierly Man, to the East Part of <HI>Fife,</HI> with all the Secrecy possible, having with him the Lord <HI>Strathmore,</HI> and several other very able Officers, and about 2000 Foot, most Nor∣thern <HI>Highland</HI> Men, with Orders to watch their Opportunity, when the Tide was coming in, that so the Men of War might not be able to in∣tercept them, to embark, and land themselves on the other Shore; while this was doing, he caus'd another Body to march openly to <HI>Brunt-Island,</HI> and getting several Boats together there, makes a Feint of embarking his Men there; the Men of War having Notice of his Design at <HI>Brunt-Island,</HI> mann'd out their Boats, and sent them to attack them, slipping their Cables, and standing in for the Shore, in order to second the Boats; at which the Rebels, as if they were afraid of being taken, retir'd to <HI>Brunt-Island;</HI> the Men of War stood in after them, and let fly several Shot among them, but with little Damage; while, in the mean Time, they discover'd from their Top-Masts, tho' but too late, that the main Body of the Re∣bels were actually passing the <HI>Firth</HI> 12 Miles be∣low;
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
and that they appear'd in the mid Channel, almost half over.</P>
<P>It was in vain for the Men of War to stir, the Tide of Flood being very strong against them, and little or no Wind, and that Wind that was, not very fair for them; all they could do, was to man out some Boats, which they did; who row∣ing under Shore, came up time enough to inter∣cept one of the Boats, with 45 Men in it, who labour'd under the Misfortune of having broken one of their Oars; this Boat they took, and the Men were carried Prisoners into <HI>Leith,</HI> and put in∣to the <HI>Talbooth;</HI> where, in a few Days, their Friends reliev'd them.</P>
<P>But the Men of War, as soon as the Tide turn'd, falling down, came time enough to cut off Eight Boats, who were too far behind the rest, and who had embark'd in another Place, and giving them Chase, they put back to the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> a small Island on the South-East Point of <HI>Fifeland;</HI> where, being near 400 Men, the Men of Wars Boats durst not land their Men to attack them; and the next Day or two they landed again in <HI>Fife,</HI> with my Lord <HI>Strathmore</HI> at the Head of them.</P>
<P>The foremost Boats set their Men safe on Shore at <HI>Tantallon, Aberlady, North Berwick,</HI> and on the Shores between, to the Number of about 1600 Men, and Brigadier <HI>Mackintosh</HI> at the Head of them; this was the 12th of <HI>October</HI> in the Morn∣ing; and the same Day they march'd to <HI>Hadding∣ton,</HI> a wall'd Town, and large, but not strong, within 12 Miles of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>It is easy to believe, that this surprising News put the People of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> into a terrible Con∣sternation; the Friends to the Government made no Doubt, but they would march directly to
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
<HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and they knew great Numbers in that City waited only an Opportunity of such a Body of Men, to protect them in their appearing; so they doubted nothing, but that they would make a general Revolt upon this Occasion.</P>
<P>But this was the least of the Danger; for had the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> as was expected, advanced at the same Time with the Gross of his Army to face the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> or to force his Way over the <HI>Forth,</HI> and at the same Time sent over 2 or 3000 Men more, at the <HI>Queens-Ferry,</HI> or at <HI>Cul∣ross;</HI> all which it had been most easy for him to do; I say, had he done either of these, it had been impossible that the Duke could have been spar'd from the Army, or have spared any of his Troops for the Relief of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and his fail∣ing in this, was not only a Disappointment, but a Confirmation of what was not known till after∣wards, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Design of the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> in sending over Brigadier <HI>Mackintosh,</HI> was not to attack <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but to march to the <HI>South,</HI> to encourage the Viscount <HI>Kenmure,</HI> and the Friends they had on that Side; and then to march in a Body to join the <HI>Northumberland</HI> General, as they call'd him; and so to march into <HI>England,</HI> to at∣tempt a Diversion; and therefore in a Letter which the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> wrote to Mr. <HI>Forster,</HI> which was afterwards intercepted, he calls <HI>Mac∣kintosh</HI>'s March to the Citadel of <HI>Leith,</HI> a wrong Step.</P>
<P>However it was, this wrong Step of the Lord <HI>Mar</HI>'s sav'd <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and, perhaps, all <HI>Scotland;</HI> for Brigadier <HI>Mackintosh</HI> being come to <HI>Hadding∣ton,</HI> had such Accounts given him of the Surprize of the Citizens of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the dreadful Consternation the People were in; and such Assu∣rances
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
given him, of the Certainty of surprising the City, that he resolv'd to march directly to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> which accordingly he did the next Day, and came to <HI>Carstorphen,</HI> a Village within a Mile of the City, about 6 that Evening. But not finding any Numbers come out to him, as he expected; but, on the contrary, hearing that the Citizens had shut the Gates, and were in Arms to defend themselves; and that a Detachment of Dragoons were expected every Minute in the Ci∣ty from <HI>Sterling.</HI> These Reasons, and, which was more than all the rest, his own want of sufficient Numbers to force the Gates, oblig'd him to alter his March, and to turn to the Right, marching directly to the Town of <HI>Leith;</HI> which he entred, and where he immediately released the 45 Men, which, as I said, were taken coming over the <HI>Firth.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing is more certain, than that if they had been but 2000 more Men, he would not have fail'd of being Master of the Town that Night; but his whole Strength was not above 14 or 1600 Men; and yet it was the Opinion of most Peo∣ple, that if he had push'd at it, he would have carry'd the Place; the Citizens being at that time in no Condition to have repuls'd him, and the Friends to his Design too ready to have join'd him, if he had been strong enough to have made the Attempt.</P>
<P>In the Interim of all this Hurry, the Citizens of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> sent away Express upon Express to the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> for Succour; and the Duke immediately sent away 300 Dragoons to <HI>Lithgow,</HI> half way to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to lie there till he heard again, and till he got some Light into their De∣sign; but when, by the very next Express, he
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
understood they were advancing to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he comes away himself with 100 Dragoons and 200 Foot; and he was so expeditious in this March, that about Two a Clock in the Morning of the 15th he came to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> being the Morning after <HI>Mackintosh</HI> with his Men was in Possession of <HI>Leith.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke being resolv'd to give the Revels no Rest, having refresh'd his Troops a little, who had been fatigu'd very much with a hasty March, thro' a whole Winter Night, began to draw out his little Army, which he found compos'd of se∣veral sorts of People: <HI>1st,</HI> There was 400 Dra∣goons, and 200 Foot, of regular Troops, on whom he could depend; there was next the New Re∣giment of 400 Men, rais'd by the City, and 150 Granadiers, call'd the Town-Guard, all good for little; next there was about 500 Men of Militia Horse, and Voluntiers on Foot; but ill arm'd, and not very fit for Service, especially the Foot.</P>
<P>With this Army the Duke march'd to <HI>Leith,</HI> where the old Brigadier, having Notice of their Design to attack him, had quitted the South Part of the Town, and was retir'd into the Citadel, where he began to fortify; and having taken six or eight small Pieces of Cannon out of some Ships in the Road, with what Powder and Ball he could find, he planted two Pieces of Cannon on the Bridge, and two more at proper Places, by the Entrance into the old Works, and prepar'd to de∣fend himself.</P>
<P>The Citadel of <HI>Leith</HI> is an old demolish'd Forti∣fication, formerly call'd by that Name; it was built by <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> to guard the Port; the Scituation is good, having the Sea on the North</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151"/>
side, and the Haven and River on the East side, winding round Part of the South; so that it was to be attack'd, when the Works were good, only on the West side, where the Country is a Plain. When this Fort was, as they call it, demolish'd, it was not done by undermining and blowing up the Works, as is now the Usage in such Cases; but by throwing the Top of the Lines and Basti∣ons into the Ditches, and breaking down the Gates, taking up the Bridges, and the like; by this Means the solid Parts of the Works remain, and so it is at <HI>Leith;</HI> nor would it require much Time or Charge to restore the Citadel to a regu∣lar, compleat Fortification.</P>
<P>By this the Reader may judge, that the Works were so high, and the Ditches still so plainly seen, and so low, that the Port being secur'd, the Horse could be of no Service in an Attack; and the Duke being too weak in Foot for an Assault Sword in Hand, he soon found there was no∣thing to be done without more Forces, and without Cannon; so he halted, and resolv'd to retreat.</P>
<P>But before he did so, he summon'd them to lay down their Arms, and surrender, upon Pain of High Treason; declaring withal, that if they o∣blig'd him to bring Cannon to force them, and they kill'd any of his Men in resisting, he would give them no Quarter. However, he receiv'd a resolute Answer from a <HI>Highland</HI> Laird, call'd <HI>Ki∣nackin;</HI> who told the Duke, that as to Surren∣dring, they laugh'd at it; and as to bringing Cannon, and assaulting them, they were ready for him; that they would neither take or give any Quarter with him; and if he thought he was able to force them, <HI>he might try his Hand.</HI></P>

The Duke seeing there was no good to be done with them without Cannon, and without more Foot, retir'd to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and immediately gave Orders for Four Pieces of Cannon to be drawn down to <HI>Leith</HI> from the Castle, and intend∣ing to make the 400 Dragoons serve on Foot, he resolv'd to attack them early the next Morn∣ing.</P>
<P>But old <HI>Mackintosh</HI> had other Things in his Head; for, having fail'd in his grand Design upon <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he intended no more by his Re∣treat into the Citadel of <HI>Leith,</HI> than to keep him∣self from being oblig'd to fight with Disadvantage, he having no Horse; and as little therefore did he intend to stay there, till he was surrounded with more Forces than he was a Match for; and therefore resolv'd to put an End to the Preparati∣ons of the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> by a sudden and unex∣pected Retreat that same Night; for about Nine a Clock at Night, the Tide being out, and the Mouth of the Harbour being so easily passable at low Tide, as sometimes to be scarce over Shoes in Water; they went silently out of the Citadel, and not passing thro' any Part of the Town, went di∣rectly down to the Sands, pass'd the Mouth of the Harbour a great way below the <HI>Peers,</HI> march∣ing due East, close by the Edge of the Sea, the Sands being there so flat and broad, that they could neither be seen or heard in the Night; thus they went off with such Secrecy, and were gone so far before any one had Knowledge of it, or at least before the Duke could make any Dispo∣sitions to follow them, <HI>the Night being very dark,</HI> that it was to no Purpose to think of pursuing them till Morning; when Advice came to the Duke, that they had taken Possession of <HI>Seaton-House,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
the Dwelling of the Earl of <HI>Wintoun,</HI> about nine Miles from <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> a House strong built, and wall'd round; so as neither there, any more than at the Citadel of <HI>Leith,</HI> could they be at∣tack'd without more Forces than the Duke had at Hand, nor without the Help of Cannon. A∣bout 50 of their Men, who were drunk with Li∣quor, or with Sleep, and were left in the Citadel, including 15 or 16 that were left by the Way, not able to march with the rest, were brought Prisoners to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and this was their next Halt.</P>
<P>Here being secure again for a few Days, they entrench'd the Avenues to the House, and forti∣fy'd the Gate so as not to be in Danger of Sur∣prize; and sent out into the Country to bring in Mutton, Cows, Salt, and Meal, which they took in such Quantities, as made the Country afraid they intended to wait there for more Men to come over the <HI>Firth</HI> to them; but they had no such View, it seems; neither if they had, would it have been to any Purpose; for the Men of War, and arm'd Smacks, had so spread the <HI>Firth,</HI> that it was scarce practicable for any open single Boat to pass them, much less a Fleet of Boats.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> finding where they were Roosted, now resolv'd to give them as little Rest here, as he had done at <HI>Leith;</HI> and therefore sent out immediately a Detachment of Dragoons, with a Body of the Voluntier Horse, to alarm them. This Detachment came up to the House; but finding the Scituation and Posture of the E∣nemy such, as that nothing could be attempted without more Forces, they return'd the same Night.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="154"/>
In the mean Time, the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> hearing of this false Step of his Detachment, and not doubt∣ing but they would be fallen upon from <HI>Sterling,</HI> took that Step now for their Deliverance, which, had he taken at first by Concert with them, had been a fatal Blow to the Affair in general, <HI>as is noted above;</HI> for he advanc'd from <HI>Perth</HI> to <HI>Dum∣blain</HI> with all his Cavalry, and 3000 Foot being order'd to follow, made a motion also in order to join him: This March of the Enemy alarm'd the Royal Army at <HI>Sterling,</HI> and they sent Ex∣presses of it to the Duke of <HI>Argyle;</HI> who, upon this Advice, leaving the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> no more than 100 Dragoons, and 150 Foot, with General <HI>Wightman</HI> to defend them, went back immediately with the rest of the Forces to the Camp.</P>
<P>Had the Rebels in <HI>Seaton-House</HI> known either of this Movement of the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> or of the go∣ing back of the Duke, they would soon have taken more Freedom than they did with those that were left. But, to amuse them, the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> with 300 Voluntiers, the Lord <HI>Torphichen</HI> with the 100 Dragoons which the Duke had left, and some o∣ther Troops, such as they had, making in all about 600 Men, marched up to <HI>Seaton-House</HI> again, where old <HI>Mackintosh</HI> kept himself close in his Fortifications, which they, without Cannon, and a good Body of regular Troops, were in no Condition to attack; This was the 17th of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>By this Time the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> had Intelligence of the Retreat, and hearing that the Duke of <HI>Ar∣gyle</HI> was come back to <HI>Sterling,</HI> he left <HI>Dumblain,</HI> and march'd back again to <HI>Perth;</HI> and thus, for five or six Days, the poor Men on both Sides were
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
harrass'd backward and forward to little or no other Purpose than to amuse and prevent one ano∣ther; nor was there hardly a Musquet fir'd on all these Occasions.</P>
<P>But the poor Country was left naked by this Means, and the fruitful rich Provinces of <HI>East</HI> and <HI>Mid Lothain,</HI> the <HI>Mers, Tiveotdale,</HI> &amp;c. were un∣happily left to be ravaged by a little, and other∣wise a contemptible Body of 1400, or at most 1500 Men; this the <HI>Scots</HI> complain'd loudly of; but the Circumstances of Things admitted no Remedy at that Time, all the Troops being employed, and every one's Hands full.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Mackintosh</HI> was now at Leisure; and indeed had his Intelligence been good at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he would have been more sensible of the Advantage of his present Circumstances; for tho' it was true, that he was not strong enough to attack the City of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> so neither were they in any Condi∣tion to attack him; and had he sally'd out with 7 or 800 of his Men upon their Body of Horse, who were no other than private Gentlemen Vo∣luntiers, except about 80 Dragoons, he would have made but too easy an Experiment of their Weakness; for though they visited him two or three Times, and alarm'd him at <HI>Seaton-House,</HI> yet they were never above 600 strong at a Time, or thereabouts, and among them no regular Men, or not above 100. But it seems, the Brigadier did not know that the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> was gone back to <HI>Sterling,</HI> or that the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> had made any Motion in his Favour; otherwise he might have insulted them again at the Gates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> as often as he had pleased; but he expecting every Day to be invested, and Cannon to be brought down against him, very happily for the City of
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> though unluckily for him, resolved to pursue his first Direction, <HI>viz.</HI> to march towards the <HI>English</HI> Border, and join that Body of Men who were risen in <HI>Dumfreisshire,</HI> under the Viscount <HI>Kenmure;</HI> with whom were the Earls of <HI>Nithis∣dale, Winton,</HI> and <HI>Carnwarth,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Nairn,</HI> with Abundance of Gentlemen of Quality; such as Lord <HI>Murray,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Athol;</HI> the Master of <HI>Nairn,</HI> eldest Son to the Lord <HI>Nairn,</HI> and several others. These being at first said to be 300 Horse, were advanc'd to <HI>Moffat,</HI> in Pur∣suit of a Design to intercept the Marquis of <HI>Anan∣dale,</HI> and very narrowly miss'd him; and having fail'd of that Design, lay about <HI>Moffat,</HI> expecting to hear from their Brethren in the Rebellion in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who, about this Time also, as we had observ'd before, were march'd from <HI>Hex∣am</HI> to <HI>Morpeth,</HI> and now advanc'd to the Border, and entering <HI>Scotland,</HI> cross'd the <HI>Tweed</HI> at <HI>Kelso,</HI> where soon after they all met; for Brigadier <HI>Mackintosh</HI> quitting <HI>Seaton-House</HI> on the 19th, march'd to <HI>Duns,</HI> within six Miles of <HI>Berwick,</HI> the same Day that the <HI>Northumberland</HI> Men came to <HI>Morpeth;</HI> where he lay two or three Days; and from whence, on the 22d, they march'd to <HI>Kelso,</HI> where they were all in one Day join'd by the Viscount of <HI>Kenmure</HI> with his Body from the <HI>West</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by the new General <HI>Forster,</HI> and the <HI>Northumberland</HI> Men, from the Border; and thus we have brought them all into one Body, making, as was reported by the most exact Ac∣counts, about 2300 Men.</P>
<P>The Rebellion was now come to a Head, and the two Principal Bodies of them being thus drawn together from all Parts, began to look for∣midable: Nor indeed were they to be dispised, had
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
they been well directed; for they miscarried in no Part of their Undertaking, but for want of Council, and want of Intelligence: Not taking right Measures, as they themselves acknowledg'd afterwards, when they could look back, and cooly reflect upon their Mistakes.</P>
<P>I have not Room here to trace every Step of the Parties which drew together to Form these Bodies; as particularly, of General <HI>Gordon</HI> with the <HI>Highlanders</HI> from the Side of <HI>Inverary;</HI> the Lord <HI>Kenmure</HI> with a Body of Gentlemen from the Side of <HI>Dumfries;</HI> and the like: But I hasten to the General Action, when all Parties made up their Strength, and brought it to a Day with this remarkable Circumstances, that it was a Day in∣deed; for the Battle at <HI>Sherriff Muir</HI> or <HI>Dumblain,</HI> and that at <HI>Preston</HI> in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> were fought on the very same Day, as will appear by and by.</P>
<P>To bring them then to Action, I return to the <HI>Northumberland</HI> Men, who being marcht up to the Border of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as before, were joined at <HI>Kelso</HI> upon the <HI>Tweed,</HI> by the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen un∣der the Lord <HI>Kenmure,</HI> and by the Forces which pass'd the <HI>Firth</HI> with old Brigadier <HI>Mackin∣tosh.</HI></P>
<P>Here, being in Council what to do, and hear∣ing that General <HI>Carpenter</HI> advanced towards them with three Regiments of Dragoons and one of Foot, they resolved to march to the South. It had been proposed to march into the West of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which had, without doubt, been very much to their Advantage, as they were strong e∣nough to have forced their way, and perhaps have at last opened a Way to the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> to have join'd them, or else have surrounded the
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
Royal Army at <HI>Stirling:</HI> But Fate and English Councils prevail'd.</P>
<P>Having resolv'd to march for <HI>England,</HI> and at∣tack General <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who in all had not above 700 Men with him, they accordingly advanced from <HI>Kelso</HI> on the 27th of <HI>October,</HI> and passing the River, march'd to <HI>Jedburgh.</HI> It is true, this was not the way to attack General <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who lay at <HI>Wooller,</HI> about 12 Miles from <HI>Kelso:</HI> But it seems they had altered their Mind, <HI>and fatally for them it was;</HI> for had they boldly attack'd Gene∣ral <HI>Carpenter,</HI> they would have gone fair to have defeated him, his Number being so small, and the Battalion of Foot which he had un∣der his Command not being come up at that time.</P>
<P>They Halted at <HI>Jedburgh</HI> two Days, considering what Course to take: Three ways offered to them; one was Marching into the West of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> the other attacking General <HI>Carpenter,</HI> the third was Marching into <HI>England;</HI> and this last they chose, though the worst of the three.</P>
<P>The <HI>Highlanders</HI> and some of the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentle∣men, especially the Earl of <HI>Winton,</HI> urged the First with stronge Arguments, and so Embarked the <HI>Highlanders</HI> in it, that when other Measures were resolv'd on, they Mutiny'd, and would not march. His Scheme was, to cross the <HI>Western Dales,</HI> and join the <HI>Clans</HI> about the <HI>Scourse</HI> of <HI>Forth;</HI> or to send Word to the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> that they would fall upon the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Rear, while he advancing they might surround and defeat him, his Number being at that time but very small.</P>
<P>This was so good a Scheme in it self, and so well argued by the <HI>Scots</HI> Noblemen, that when
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
the other Resolutions were taken, at the pressing desire of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility, the <HI>Scots Highlanders</HI> resolved that they would not pass the Border; but if it was insisted on, they would separate, and go back into <HI>Scotland;</HI> however, as they resolv'd to keep together to the Borders, they march'd from <HI>Jedburgh</HI> to <HI>Langholm.</HI></P>
<P>It was on this March that the <HI>English</HI> Lords resolving to march for <HI>England,</HI> they recalled a strong Detachment made to attack <HI>Dumfreis,</HI> and then drew up at <HI>Howick Moor,</HI> and held another Council of War, where the <HI>Highlanders</HI> refused to march, unless it was to attack General <HI>Carpenter;</HI> nor was this Mutiny ever appeased, but the <HI>High∣landers</HI> positively insisting, and not to be prevail'd with to stir over the Border, 500 of them separa∣ted into small Bodies, and went off, resolving to surrender themselves to the King's Troops; which they did, and were for some Months after kept Prisoners at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and at <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> but at length released.</P>
<P>The rest of the <HI>Highlanders</HI> being, by Perswa∣sions, and some Money given them, prevailed with to keep together, they all took Resolution to give General <HI>Carpenter</HI> the slip, and to march for <HI>England,</HI> having, as they plainly saw, the ad∣vantage, by their Scituation, of three Days march of him: With these Resolutions, and the Hopes of a great Insurrection in <HI>England</HI> to favour their Designs, they decamped from <HI>Howick,</HI> and by a very long and swift March reached to <HI>Longtoun</HI> that Night, which is within Seven Miles of the <HI>English</HI> Border, leaving the Four Pieces of Can∣non they had with them at <HI>Langholm,</HI> that they might not retard them in their March.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="160"/>
Next Day, the 30th of <HI>October,</HI> they entred <HI>England,</HI> and march'd to <HI>Brampton</HI> and <HI>Cumber∣land.</HI> Here Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> opened his Commission from the <HI>Pretender,</HI> empowering him to act as General in <HI>England;</HI> and, the <HI>Highlanders</HI> were from this time regularly paid as Soldiers Six-pence a Day.</P>
<P>They halted one Night at <HI>Brampton,</HI> to refresh the Men after their hard Marches, having march'd above 100 Miles in five Days. The next Day they advanced towards <HI>Penrith:</HI> They expected to have met with some Friends here to join them; for it was reported that Mr. <HI>Dacre</HI> of <HI>Ab∣beylanner-Coast,</HI> a Papist, had promised to raise 40 Men; but he was taken with a fortunate Fe∣ver, which hindred him of his Design, and pre∣vented him and his Family from Ruin: He died since; his Name, which was very ancient, is now extinct in that Estate. As they drew near <HI>Penrith,</HI> they had notice that the Sheriff, with the <HI>Posse Comitatus,</HI> were got together, with the Lord <HI>Lonsdale,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> to the Number of 14000 Men, who resolved to stand and oppose their penetrating farther into <HI>England.</HI> The first Part of this was very true, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Posse</HI> was drawn together, nor was their Number much less. But they gave the <HI>Highland</HI> Army no occasion to try whether they would stand or no; for as soon as a Party, who the Country People sent but for Discovery, had seen some of the Men coming out of a Lane by the side of a Wood, and draw up upon a Moor, and then ad∣vance, and that they had carried an Account of this to their Main Body, they broke up their Camp in the utmost Confusion, shifting every one for themselves as well as they could, as is gene∣rally
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
the Case of an arm'd, but undisciplin'd Mul∣titude.</P>
<P>On the 5th they came to <HI>Appleby,</HI> having be∣hav'd themselves very well to the Country in ge∣neral, on their March; for I do not hear of any extraordinary Violences they exercised to any People on the way; the most Mischief I hear of, was, (1.) The taking up the Publick Moneys; such as the Excise, Land-Tax, and all the Mo∣ney belonging to the Publick Revenues, that they could meet with; which was, in the whole, very considerable too. (2.) The taking what Arms, Ammunition, and Horses, they could meet with, which were fit for Service.</P>
<P>These were Things which might indeed be ex∣pected from Men in Arms against the Govern∣ment; but as to other Violences, such as Burn∣ings, Plunderings, Murthers, Rapes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the usual Practice in like Cases, where the Soldiery are under no Discipline, I do not find that they have been charg'd with any: And the Account pub∣lished by one of their own Party, since turn'd a∣bout, acknowledges, that it having been moved to Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> to Burn the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Meeting-House at <HI>Perth,</HI> he forbid it, and said, <HI>They were to Conquer by Clemency, not by Cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Appleby</HI> they advanced to <HI>Kendal,</HI> from thence to <HI>Kirkby Launsdale,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Lancaster;</HI> and having thus push'd near Four∣score Miles into the Country, without fighting, they were greatly encouraged, and their Friends began now to appear and join them.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lancaster</HI> they seized at the Custom-house some small Arms, with a quantity of Wine and Brandy, which was divided among the Soldiers; they also took Six Pieces of Cannon out of a Ship
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
in the River. Being pretty much encreased by the Addition of several Gentlemen, and their Servants and Attendants, they resolv'd to ad∣vance to <HI>Manchester,</HI> where they expected great Numbers to join them; and which, had they not been prevented by the coming in of the King's Troops, would certainly have been so, as I shall soon observe.</P>
<P>Here it is observed, that if they had staid at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> a Place strong by Situation, they had not only encreased their Strength, and been well supplied with many things they wanted, but they could not have been attack'd, as they were, without Cannon: Nor had they been worsted, would they have been obliged to so an entire Surrender; but might either have made better Terms for themselves, or have made their Escapes by Sea.</P>
<P>But Fate and their own Mistakes hurry'd them on; and on the Ninth of <HI>November</HI> they march'd for <HI>Preston,</HI> having first released some of their Friends who had been confin'd in the Castle of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> by Virtue of the late Act of Parlia∣ment mentioned before. Their Design now was plain; <HI>(viz.)</HI> to seize upon the Pass of <HI>Warrington</HI> Bridge, and the Town of <HI>Manchester</HI> there.</P>
<P>The 10th they entred <HI>Preston,</HI> and ended their March; for they were presently informed here, that the King's Troops were advancing to attack them; this was on the 12th; upon this News they alter'd their Resolution of marching to <HI>Bol∣ton,</HI> as they had before intended, and resolved to fortify themselves in the Post they were in, and expect the King's Troops there.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="163"/>
The Alarm being now given, a Body of their Foot marched out of the Town as far as <HI>Ribble-Bridge,</HI> posting themselves there, and Mr. <HI>Forster,</HI> with a Party of Horse, went beyond it to get a certain Account of Things; when dis∣covering the Vanguard of the Dragoons, he re∣turned another Way, not coming back by the Bridge; but sent with all hast to give an Account of the Approach of the King's Army, and to give Orders to prepare to receive them, whilst he went to view a Ford in the River, in order for a Passage to come behind them. The Foot that were advanced to the Bridge were about an 100; but they were choice, stout, and well-armed Men, and commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>John Farquharson</HI> of <HI>Innercall,</HI> belonging to <HI>Mac∣kintosh</HI>'s Battalion: He was a good Officer and a very bold Man, and would have defended that important Pass of the Bridge to the last Drop, and till the rest had advanced and drawn them∣selves out of the Town; but he was order'd to retreat to <HI>Preston:</HI> This Retreat was another wrong step, and has been condemned on all hands as one of the greatest Oversights they could be guilty of; for the River is not fordable but a good Way above and below the Bridge, which they might have made impassable also, by several Methods practised on like Occasions. As for the Bridge, they might have barricado'd it so well, that it would have been impracticable to have pass'd there, or to have dislodged them from it; also they had Cannon, which General <HI>Wills</HI> wanted: And here alone indeed it might be said they were in a Condition to have made an effectual Stand; for here the King's Forces would have been entirely exposed to their Fire, having
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
no Cover; whereas the Rebels could have very much secured themselves against the other's Fire, by the Bridge, and by the Rising-Ground near it. General <HI>Wills</HI> did indeed expect some Difficulty and Opposition at this Place, believing, by their Situation, that the Rebels would have made their greatest Effort at that Place; but under∣standing by his Advance-Guard that the Rebels had abandon'd that Post, he was surprized, and suspected that then they had some Stratagem in hand, and perhaps had lined the Hedges, and so made the Lane unpassable for his Men. The Lane is indeed very deep, and so narrow that in several Places two Men cannot ride abreast. Ge∣neral <HI>Wills,</HI> on those Suppositions, proceeded with Caution, and caused the Hedges and Fields to be view'd, and the Ways laid open for his Caval∣ry to enter; but finding the Hedges also clear, he concluded then, that the Enemy was fled, and expected that they had abandon'd the Town and all, and would endeavour by long Marches to re∣turn to <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' he thought it impossible for them to do that too: But he soon understood that they were retreated to the Town only, and that they resolv'd to receive him there with a re∣solute Countenance; so he had nothing to do but to prepare for the Attack, which he went about immediately. Having advanced nearer the Town, he ordered his Troops to pass at a Gate which leads into the Fields which lie on the back of the Town, and immediately spreading the Enclosures with the utmost Expedition and Diligence, so disposed of his Forces as best to be able both to attack them in the Town, and to prevent them from Sallying or making a Re∣treat.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165"/>
During this time, they were not idle in the Town, nor did they appear in the least discoura∣ged, but applied themselves resolutely to their Business, barrocading the Streets, and posting their Men there, and in the bye-Lanes, and Houses, to the greatest Advantage, for all Events. The Gentlemen-Voluntiers were drawn up in the Church-yard, under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Derwentwater,</HI> Viscount <HI>Kenmure,</HI> Earls of <HI>Win∣toun</HI> and <HI>Nithsdale.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Derwentwater</HI> signally behav'd, having stript into his Wastcoat, and encouraged the Men, by giving them Money to cast up Trenches, and animating them to a vigorous Defence of them. They form'd Four main Barriers; one a little below the Church, commanded by Brigadier <HI>Mackintosh;</HI> the Gentle∣men in the Church-yard were to support that Bar∣rier in particular, and Lord <HI>Charles Murray</HI> that which was at the End of a Lane leading to the Fields: The third Barrier was called the Wind-mill; this was commanded by Colonel <HI>Mackin∣tosh:</HI> And the Fourth was in the Street which leads towards <HI>Liverpool,</HI> commanded by Major <HI>Miller</HI> and Mr. <HI>Douglass.</HI> The three former were all attack'd with great Fury by the King's For∣ces: The first Attack was made upon the Barrier below the Church, commanded by Brigadier <HI>Mackintosh;</HI> but they met with such a Reception, and so terrible a Fire was made upon them, as well from the Barricado as from the Houses on both sides, that they were obliged to retreat back to the Entrance of the Town. During the Heat of this Action, some of <HI>Preston</HI>'s Officers being inform'd that the Street leading to <HI>Wigan</HI> was not barricado'd, and that the Houses were not posses∣sed on that side, they presently entred that Street
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
with great Bravery, pushing all before them <HI>Preston</HI>'s Regiment of Foot were commanded up∣on this Service, supported by <HI>Honnywood</HI>'s Dra∣goons. It is true, Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> had at first taken Possession of that Street, and posted Men in the Houses on both sides; but they were, against their Inclination, called off to other Service; nor were they left, as some desir'd, to post themselves at the extreamest Ends of the Town, even at that End which leads to the Bridge, where the first and hottest Attack was made. Several Houses were left, particularly one which belonged to Sir <HI>Henry Haughton:</HI> Captain <HI>Innis</HI> with Fifty High∣landers had taken Possession of this House; and had he been allowed to have continued there, he might have given a good Account of it; but he also was call'd off from that Post, some of <HI>Preston</HI>'s Men got Possession of that too, tho' it cost them dear, for many of their Men were kill'd there from other Houses. It is a high House, over∣looking the whole Town: There was also ano∣ther House opposite to it, which they entred, and posted several of their Men in it. And from these two Houses came almost all the Loss the Northern People sustained during the Action. Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> cannot be blamed for this Oversight, but it must be charged upon the Brigadier, who a little while before <HI>Preston</HI>'s Foot made this brave and bold Attack, withdrew his Men from those Houses. The Attack was thus, <HI>Preston</HI>'s Men, led by their Lieutenant-Colonel the Lord <HI>Forester,</HI> did not come up to the Head of the Street, but marched in∣to a straight Passage behind the Houses, and then made a Halt 'till their Lieutenant-Colonel the Lord <HI>Forester</HI> came into the open Street with his drawn Sword in his Hand, and faced <HI>Mackintosh</HI>'s
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
Barrier, looking up and down the Street, and viewing how they were posted. There were ma∣ny Shots fired at him, but he returned to his Men, and came up again at the Head of them into the middle Street, where he caused some to face the Barricade where the Brigadier was post∣ed, and ply them with their Shot, at the same time commanding another Party to march cross the Streets, to take Possession of those Houses. Whilst this was doing, the other from the Bar∣rier, and from the Houses on both sides, made a terrible Fire upon them, and a great many of that old and gailant Regiment were killed and wound∣ed: The Lord <HI>Forester</HI> received several Wounds himself. Besides the Damage they received on that side, they were sore galled from some Windows below them, by Captain <HI>Douglass</HI> and Captain <HI>Hunter</HI>'s Men. <HI>Preston</HI>'s Foot fired smartly upon the Barrier, but did little Execution, the Men being generally cover'd from the Shot, and deli∣vering their own Shot securely, and with good Aim; yet some were kill'd, and some also wound∣ed, particularly two very gallant Gentlemen were wounded here, and both dy'd of their Wounds; the one was Captain <HI>Peter Farquharson</HI> of <HI>Rochaley,</HI> a Gentleman of an invincible Spirit, and almost inimitable Bravery. This Gentleman being shot through the Bone of the Leg, endured a great deal of Torture in the Operation of the Surgeon. When he was first brought into the Inn call'd the <HI>White Bull,</HI> the House where all the wounded Men were carry'd to be dress'd, he took a Glass of Brandy, and said, <HI>Come, Lads, here is your Ma∣ster's Health; though I can do no more, I wish you good Success.</HI> His Leg was cut off by one who I may call a Butcher, rather than a Surgeon, and
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
he presently died. The other was Mr. <HI>Clifton,</HI> Brother to Sir <HI>Jervas Clifton,</HI> he was also a gal∣lant and throughly accomplish'd Gentleman; he receiv'd a shot in the Knee, of which he died some Hours after. There was another Gentle∣man call'd Colonel <HI>Brereton,</HI> who had formerly serv'd in the Army; he had many Wounds, one of which, by the vast Flux of Blood, was not discover'd soon enough by his Surgeon, or else it's thought he might have outliv'd his Fate that Day: After he was bury'd, he was ta∣ken out of his Grave, to satisfie the Curiosity of a Commanding Officer, who could not be per∣swaded that this Gentleman was in the Rebel∣lion.</P>
<P>The next Barrier which was attack'd, was commanded by Lord <HI>Charles Murray:</HI> He behav'd very gallantly, but being vigorously attack'd, wanted Men, and sent to the Earl of <HI>Derwent∣water</HI> for Help, who immediately sent him a Re∣lief of 50 Gentlemen Voluntiers from the Church∣yard to reinforce him, who came in very seasona∣bly. Immediately Parson <HI>Patten</HI> was order'd over the Barrier to view the King's Forces, who ap∣pearing in a Clergyman's Habit, was not suspe∣cted, nor fired at. He soon returned back, and gave Lord <HI>Charles</HI> an Account, that by what he saw, they were resolved to attack him again; whereupon Lord <HI>Charles</HI> gave Orders to his Men to be ready to receive them: Accordingly they came on very furiously, and tho' the King's Forces that made this Attack, were, for the most part, raw, new-listed Men, and seem'd unwil∣ling to fight; yet the Bravery and good Conduct of experienc'd Officers supply'd very much that Defect. However, Lord <HI>Charles Murray</HI> main∣tain'd
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
the Post, and oblig'd them to retreat with Loss; nor, had they been all old Soldiers, could they have beaten Lord <HI>Charles</HI> from that Barrier, which was very strong; the Number they had slain from the Barn-holes and Barrier it self added very much, so that at last the Officers themselves thought fit to give it over.</P>
<P>The third Attack was at the Windmill in the Street which leads to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> where the Barri∣er was defended by near 300 Men, under the Command of Mr. <HI>Mackintosh,</HI> who, with his Men, behaved very boldly, and made a dreadful Fire upon the King's Forces, killing many on the spot, and obliging them to make a Retreat; which, however, they did very handsomely. This was owing to the Common Men, who were but new∣listed; tho' the Officers and old Soldiers behav'd themselves with great Bravery.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Rebels seem'd to have had some Advantage, having repulsed the King's Forces in all their Attacks, and maintained all their Posts; and Night drawing on, no new Action happen'd; but during all this time, and all <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, and <HI>Sunday,</HI> and good part of that Night, the King's Forces kept incessantly Plattoons firing up∣on them, from Sir <HI>Henry Haughton</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Ayre</HI>'s Houses. It's true, they kill'd but very few; those of Note were, one Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> a Cornet, one Mr. <HI>Scattery,</HI> and a Highland Gentleman belong∣ing to the Lord <HI>Nairn.</HI> There were several Hou∣ses and Barns set on fire by both Parties, both for covering themselves among the Smoak, and dislodging Men; so that if the Wind had blown almost from any Quarter, the whole Town had been burnt to the Ground, and the Men had been burnt to Ashes in it.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="170"/>
But the wiser Heads among them began now to see that they were not able to carry it on, or to defend themselves long in this Situation; and that which was yet more, their Ammunition began to fail them, having not above one Barrel of Powder left.</P>
<P>The Heads of them therefore began to think of Capitulating, and met together at Night to that Purpose; the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> Col. <HI>Oxburgh,</HI> and some others, entred into a Consultation about it; the Result of which was, that Col. <HI>Oxburgh</HI> was sent out to treat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Highlanders,</HI> to give them their Due, scorn'd the very Name of a Surrender, and de∣manded to sally out, and die like Men of Honour, with their Swords in their Hands; but they were made believe, that General <HI>Wills</HI> had sent and of∣fer'd them honourable Conditions.</P>
<P>When the Colonel came to General <HI>Wills,</HI> he was received respectively, as to his Person; but was told positively, that there was no room to Treat, and that they had nothing to do but to Surrender at Discretion.</P>
<P>The Colonel urg'd it very hard, and sometimes insisted, that they were not reduced to such a Con∣dition; that they had their Arms in their hands, and knew how to die like Men of Honour, and to sell their Lives dear enough. The General told them, That they had nothing more to do than to prepare for it; and the Consequence should be, that he would not give one Man of them Quarter.</P>
<P>The Colonel insisted then, that the General would promise their Lives should be spar'd; which the General, it is said, denied; but encouraged them to expect his Majesty's Clemency.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="171"/>
I know there has been a Dispute in this Case; the one side claiming Life, as the natural Conse∣quence of a Surrender to Mercy; the other deny∣ing it: Nor can I pretend to decide it here. The Matter of Fact was no other but this, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That Colonel <HI>Oxburgh</HI> finding no better Bargain could be made for them, agreed at last to yield at Dis∣cretion; which was done.</P>
<P>The Common Soldiers were in a great Rage at the Thoughts of a Surrender, and all was in a Tumult for some time; nay, two or three were shot Dead by them, for but mentioning it. But there was no Remedy; the Gentlemen had con∣sented, and the rest were obliged to submit.</P>
<P>At the Time appointed therefore, which was at Seven the next Morning, the two Generals en∣tred the Town in form, at the Head of their Troops, with Trumpets sounding, and Drums beating. They came in at several Streets, from the Places they were posted at, and all met in the Market-place, where the <HI>Highlanders</HI> stood drawn up in very good Order, with their Arms. The Noblemen and Gentlemen immediately put them∣selves into their Hands, and were secured in seve∣ral Inns in the Town. Then the <HI>Highlanders</HI> were Commanded to lay down their Arms; which they did, and were secured in the Church, under a strong Guard, where their Accommodation was indeed but very indifferent; but it did not last long.</P>
<P>Thus ended this Affair. The Loss on both Sides was then cast up. Of the King's Troops, there was a great many Officers wounded, as Brigadier <HI>Honnywood,</HI> Brigadier <HI>Dormer,</HI> Lieuten∣ant-Colonel Lord <HI>Forester,</HI> Major <HI>Bland,</HI> Captain <HI>Ogleby,</HI> Major <HI>Lawson,</HI> besides 3 Captains, 2 Lieutenants, 1 Cornet, and 4 Ensigns.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172"/>
Among the slain were, 1 Major, whose Name was <HI>Preston.</HI> And of <HI>Preston</HI>'s Regiment, 3 Cap∣tains, 1 Ensign, and about 220 Private Men.</P>
<P>Of the others, only 17 kill'd, and 25 wound∣ed.</P>
<P>The Prisoners amounted to 7 Lords, and 1489 Gentlemen and Private Solders. The Noblemen were, the Earl of <HI>Derwentwater,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Nithsdale,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Winton,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Carn∣warth,</HI> Viscount <HI>Kenmure,</HI> the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Nairn.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Fate of these Gentlemen, it will be the Subject of the next Year's Account.</P>
<P>They were now drawing together in <HI>Scotland</HI> also, and Things ripened up for Action on that side too.</P>
<P>The last Account we had of the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> was, that being joined by all the Troops he had to expect, the <HI>Clans</HI> under General <HI>Gordon</HI> only excepted, who were also ready to join him on a March, he was now preparing to decamp, and make his grand Attempt for passing the <HI>Forth,</HI> and entring the South of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in order to sup∣port his other Adherents, and carry the War into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>To this Purpose, he summon'd all his Forces together; and calling a great Council of War at <HI>Perth,</HI> where all their Measures were concerted, he left Colonel <HI>Balfour</HI> Governor of the Town, and march'd the 10th of <HI>November</HI> to <HI>Auchterarder,</HI> about 9 M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s from <HI>Perth,</HI> in order to draw his Army together, and settle the Order of Battle, as well as their Order of Marching: He had with him, if we may credit their own Report, 2300 Horse, and 5000 Foot, besides 3000 Foot which
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
join'd him the next Day; so that his Army con∣sisted of 10300 effective Men at the Time of the Battle: Only that they tell us, that 800 Men, whereof 400 were Horse, were drawn up as a Reserve on the other Side of the River, and ne∣ver came into Action.</P>
<P>It is plain, the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> had no Expectation of being oblig'd to fight so soon, or that the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> whose Forces were so much inferior in Number, would meet him half Way to give him Battle; and therefore, when the Royal Army ap∣pear'd, they had their Resolutions to deliberate; and calling a Council of War in the Field, it was unanimously resolved among them to fight, and, indeed, to begin the Attack.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> was not at all in any Un∣certainty; for when he had first an Account of the Enemy being advanc'd from <HI>Perth</HI> with his whole Army, Cannon, and Bread-Waggons, in which it was said he carried Provisions for 12 Days, it was easy to make a Judgment what his Intention was; and therefore the Duke resolving not to suffer him to dispute his Passage in Places inaccessable to the Horse, and where they could be of no Use in Battle, the Horse being the only Advantage he had, he passed the River at the Bridge of <HI>Sterling</HI> the 12th, with his whole Army, consisting but of 3500 Men, whereof about 1200 were Dragoons, all very good Troops, and com∣manded by experienc'd Officers, and advanced that Night to <HI>Dumblain.</HI></P>
<P>The Enemy was at <HI>Ardoch,</HI> about 4 Miles di∣stance, and had, by their Countenance, seem'd as resolv'd for Action as the other, having given Signals, by firing three Pieces of Cannon that E∣vening, for all their Troops to assemble; which
<PB N="173" REF="174"/>
being done, they advanc'd in Order of Battle the same Night, within about a Mile and half of the Royal Army, where they lay upon their Arms all Night, as the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Men did also.</P>
<P>On the 13th, by Break of Day, both Armies were again in Motion; and the Duke advancing to a Rising-Ground, a little before his Front, could easily discern the Enemy's Army in full March, tho' another Hill on his Left intercepted the Sight, so as that the Point of their Left Wing could not be discern'd; nor could he guess at the Extent of their Line for the same Reason, or how far they out-flank'd him. The Royal Army was drawn up upon the Hights above <HI>Dumblain,</HI> to the North-East of the Town, having the Town on his Left, at the Distance of about a Mile and half, and a wet boggy Moor, call'd <HI>Sherriffmoor,</HI> on his Right; which Moor was usually unpassable for the Cavalry, and was thought to be so then, only that a light Frost, which happen'd the two or three preceding Nights, had made it able to bear; and this the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> it seems knew, and therefore extended his Lines to take the Royal Army in Front and Flank, marching his Men di∣rectly over the Moor. This caused the Duke to alter the whole Disposition of his Front to meet the Enemy, and prevent one Part of his Men be∣ing surrounded; and this occasion'd the Disor∣der on the Left, and gave the Enemy an Opportu∣nity to charge them before they were fully form'd, as shall appear presently: For to say the Enemy's Army, who had march'd in Order of Battle above a Mile, should be ready to charge the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Army before they were form'd, if that unforeseen Incident had not oblig'd him to change
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
the Dispositions he had made, would be to say, the Rebels understood their Business better than the King's General, which no body will pretend to. However it was, this is certain, that when the Royal Army, after the changing their Front as above, began to advance, and came up to the Rising Grounds, where the Enemy first appear'd, advancing also; they found themselves within Pistol-shot of the Enemy's Right, and heard their Bagpipes playing a great Way farther to the Left than the King's Line extended.</P>
<P>The Order of Battle of the Royal Army was thus: The first Line consisted of six Battalions of Foot, all old Troops; but the Battalions being upon the reduc'd Establishment, were but thin, not exceeding 300 Men each; the Right Wing consisted of three Squadrons of Dragoons, the choicest of the Army; and the Left likewise of three Squadrons: The second Line consisted of two Battalions of Foot, and two Squadrons of Dragoons, in each Wing. The Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> was on the Right, at the Head of the Dragoons of <HI>Stairs</HI> and <HI>Evans:</HI> Brigadier <HI>Morrison</HI> had the Left; and Major-General <HI>Wightman</HI> commanded in the Center, or main Battle. Nor was it a small Loss that, in this Action, there was so great a Want of General Officers.</P>
<P>The Order of Battle of the Enemy, as we have it from their own Accounts, and from some of the Prisoners, who were taken in the Action, was thus: They were drawn up in two Lines, as fol∣lows: The Foot of the first Line, drawn up in 10 Battalions, but of unequal Numbers, form'd the main Battle, making about 4000 Men. On the Right they had five full Squadrons of Horse; and among them one, call'd the <HI>Sterling</HI> Squadron,
<PB N="175" REF="176"/>
carrying the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Standard: On the Left, they had the new Regiment, call'd the Restorati∣on Regiment of Horse, all composed, as they gave out, of Gentlemen of Quality, and pretty well Hors'd, with six Squadrons of <HI>Huntley</HI>'s and <HI>Seaforth</HI>'s Cavalry.</P>
<P>Their second Line consisted of 8 Battalions of Foot, but also not equal in Number, making about 2000 Men, flank'd with three Squadrons of Horse on each Wing; and behind these, at a Distance, they had about 400 Horse drawn up as a Reserve, and who either were not ordered to come, or did not come into the Fight.</P>
<P>In this Order they advanc'd to the Moor, and in their March possess'd a Rising Ground on their Right, which so cover'd the Point of that Wing, that it could not be seen, as before, how far it extended.</P>
<P>Upon the Dukes first extending his Right Wing, the Rebels, who were marching down directly upon him from the Moor aforesaid, and expected to have flank'd his Wing, and have charg'd before his Men were form'd, were disap∣pointed in that Part; and the Duke, on the other hand, gave Order to his Cavalry immediately to charge the Enemy, the Infantry in the Center, at the same time advancing in good Order, as fast as they could.</P>
<P>The Enemy's Horse stood the first Charge very well, and fired very furiously upon the Dragoons; but these, being better Hors'd, press'd them very hard, and, at last, in Spite of the Vigour of the Men, who shew'd that they wanted no Courage, bore them down by the meer Weight of their Horses; and putting them first into Disorder, in little more than half an Hour they fled full Speed;
<PB N="176" REF="177"/>
but as the Dragoons in pursuing kept their Order, the other rallied again in several Places, at great Distance one from another, and endeavouring to form again, shew'd they had Disposition enough to renew the Charge, if their Horses had been equal to those of the Royal Troops.</P>
<P>This very Thing takes off a little the Objection which some have raised against the Conduct of the Duke, as if he was too eager in the Pursuit, while, in the mean time, his Left suffer'd; for had he slack'd the Pursuit, and had not attack'd them in every Part as fast as they fac'd about, not giving them Time to rally any considerable Body together, he had had all his Work to do over again; especially, considering a Body of 400 Horse appear'd drawn up at a Distance, ready to have supported them, though, at that Time, there was a small River between.</P>
<P>This Manner of pursuing likewise had its Diffi∣culties, and the Enemy rallying thus continually, and every Minute making a bold Stand in one Place or other, may be guess'd at by the Length of Time which it took up to push them out of the Field, for that it was from One a Clock to near Four before they gave it over, and pass'd the little River <HI>Allan,</HI> which yet was not above two Miles and half in all.</P>
<P>While this was doing on the Right, the Left Wing had a far different Fate; for, advancing to alter the Scituation of their Front, according to the Right, they found the Main Body of the Ene∣my's Foot just in their Front, and extending be∣yond the Point of their Wing, the Enemy's Horse being still to the Left, and in Condition to take them in Flank, their Horse also not being come up. The <HI>Highland</HI> Men taking the Signal from
<PB N="177" REF="178"/>
the Fire of their Left, fell on upon the three Re∣giments of Foot, which were on the Left of the Royal Army, General <HI>Wightman,</HI> with the other three, being advanc'd to support the Right Wing: The Charge which the <HI>Highlanders</HI> gave, was so furious, and their Officers led them on so daringly, that they came up to the very Muz∣zles of the Musquets; and notwithstanding the Thrust of the Bayonet, which the Musqueteers gave in upon them very bravely, yet they rush'd in among the Ranks, receiving all their Fire, putting their Bayonets by with their Targets, and cut down the Men with their Broad Swords in a Moment, putting them into the utmost Confu∣sion.</P>
<P>It is impossible to express the Horror which some of the Gentlemen of the <HI>English</HI> Regiments say their Men were possess'd with at that unusual and savage Way of Fighting: In a word, the three Battalions were broke, and a great many of them cut in Pieces in a few Moments; and those which were not kill'd or taken, were driven in among the Dragoons, and put them likewise into Confusion.</P>
<P>Had the Cavalry upon the Right Wing of the Enemy fallen in at that Time, the whole Left Wing of the Royal Army had been cut off; nor was it in the Power of the rest of the Foot to assist them, they being advanc'd after the Right Wing, to support them in the Pursuit of the Horse.</P>
<P>The Horse of the Left Wing seeing their Foot go thus to Wreck, after making a home Charge upon some Squadrons which stood on their Flank, and who they oblig'd to retire, finding the Re∣bels endeavouring to get behind them, and so,
<PB N="178" REF="179"/>
either to march to <HI>Sterling,</HI> or cut off their Re∣treat, found themselves in no Condition to keep the Field, and retreated in good Order towards <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>By this time the Enemy, who perhaps thought their Victory compleat on their Side, as, no doubt, the Duke did on his, had, as it was reported, an Account of the Misfortune of their Left; and having no Enemy in their Front, they form'd the Infantry of their first Line with some Horse, making near 5000 Men, and march'd directly back, following by a hasty March in the Rear of those Battalions which General <HI>Wightman</HI> com∣manded, and who were still advancing after the Duke of <HI>Argyle.</HI></P>
<P>Had the Officer who led this Body, who, it is said by some, was Lieutenant General <HI>George Ha∣milton;</HI> others, Lieutenant General <HI>Gordon;</HI> o∣thers, that it was both; and that one was for charging immediately, the other for staying till their Rear was come up: We say, had they charg'd these Regiments immediately, the King's Army had been undone; but, by halting upon the Hill to form their Troops, they gave General <HI>Wight∣man</HI> Leave to face his Men to the Right about, as he himself says in his Account, and to get be∣hind some little Banks, or old Enclosures, which serv'd them for a Breast Work, and from that Cover, to draw off by little and little to <HI>Dum∣blain,</HI> whither the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> when he had entirely defeated the Left Wing of their Army, follow'd.</P>
<P>The Enemy having lost the Advantage, and thereby the Victory, march'd off after their Horse, who were gathering together on the other Side
<PB N="179" REF="180"/>
the little River; and so they all went away to <HI>Ardoch,</HI> both Sides pretending to Victory; but, doubtless, the Royal Army had the Tokens of Honour, by taking four Pieces of Cannon, tho' indeed they were not carried off till next Day; and any one that came for them with Horses to draw them, might have had them; nay, the Rebels say, the Country People drew them off to <HI>Dumblain;</HI> the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> having lost the Artil∣lery Horses, who all run away at the first of the Battle, frighted with the Noise, as is not unusual. Thus ended this Day's Action; which, if it was not a Victory to the Duke, was certainly a Victo∣ry to the King; for by this Battle the Heart of the Rebellion was broke; the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> was baulk'd in his Design; his Undertaking for a March to the South was laid aside, and never afterwards attempted, and the Superiority of his Majesty's Troops was acknowledg'd: Nor did the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> or any of his Friends, ever dis∣pute this Part of the Victory; for if they had not been broken in their Courage by the Terror of this Battle, why did they not continue the At∣tempt, and proceed on their March after the Fight, their Numbers being not so much dimi∣nished in Proportion as the Royal Army; for their Loss is not computed to be above 800 or 900 kill'd and taken, and the Royal Army is said to lose near 500 kill'd and taken; which is much more to 3500 Men, than the other was to 9000, or 10500, as was their Number before the Battle.</P>
<P>The Number of the Slain was reported as ei∣ther Side thought fit; but as for Prisoners on ei∣ther Side, those taken by the Royal Army a∣mounted to about Eighty four, most of whom
<PB N="180" REF="181"/>
were Gentlemen, the Defeat happening wholly among the Horse; the Number of Prisoners taken by the Rebels, was said to be 200; but, as the other reported, was 110, besides Officers. The Earl of <HI>Strathmore,</HI> and the Captain of <HI>Clanra∣nald,</HI> were kill'd on the Spot, on the Rebel Side; and the Earl of <HI>Forfar,</HI> in the King's Army; the Earl of <HI>Islay,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Brother, was wounded in two Places, but not mortally. The Earl of <HI>Penmure,</HI> among the Rebels was wounded very much, and taken, but retaken by his Bro∣ther, and carry'd off; and the Lord <HI>Strathalan</HI> was taken Prisoner.</P>
<P>I return now to the Civil Administration, which for a good while has been laid by: The Parlia∣ment of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was now under a Recess, which both the publick and private Affairs call'd for; which Recess being but by Adjournment, all the Impeachments given in to the House of Peers subsisted, the Parliament Prisoners remained, the Committee of Secrecy had Power to sit, and all the Publick Affairs were kept on in a State of formal Prosecution, as if the House had been still sitting.</P>
<P>But the King had another Kingdom to cast his Eye upon, and which was equally expos'd, if not more, than this; and which, as he could not withdraw his Care of, and Protection from, with∣out Diminution of the Glory of his Reign; so nei∣ther can my Account be compleat, unless I give some Account of what Steps were taken at this Time in that Part of the King's Dominions, and carry them on Hand in Hand with those of this Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="182"/>
<HI>Ireland</HI> had been for some time under the Influ∣ence of the late Administration, without the Pre∣sence of a supreme Magistrate. The Earl of <HI>Sun∣derland,</HI> who had been nam'd Lord Lieutenant for that Kingdom, having been long indispos'd, was perswaded by his Friends to resign the Post of Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Government was committed jointly to the Duke of <HI>Grafton,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Galway;</HI> and, without entring in∣to the Times and Particulars of their being nomi∣nated, their Preparations, travelling to <HI>Chester,</HI> shipping off, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is sufficient to say, they ar∣riv'd at <HI>Dublin</HI> the 1st of <HI>November,</HI> were receiv'd with the usual Solemnities, and immediately ap∣ply'd themselves to the proper Duties of that great Office, and to set to Rights the Affairs of that Country, which they found in Confusion enough.</P>
<P>A Parliament had been call'd by the King's Proclamation some Time before; and the Lords Justices being arriv'd in Time, the Two Houses met the 12th of <HI>November;</HI> and the first Thing to be done, being the Choice of a Speaker, that Choice fell unanimously upon <HI>William Connolly,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and as the Man was known, so the Choice of him gave every one a Knowledge of the Temper of the House <HI>then,</HI> viz. how they stood affected as to Parties.</P>
<P>The Speaker being chosen and approv'd, the same Day the Lords Justices made a Speech to both Houses, as follows:</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“HIS Majesty having been pleas'd to appoint us Justices and Governours of this his Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> we are glad to meet you

<P><Q>“We heartily congratulate with you upon the King's most happy Accession to the Throne; being fully perswaded, that you have a due Sense of God's Mercy in this Act of his Divine Providence, which affords us so fair a Prospect of becoming a flourishing People under the Reign of a Prince, whose Wisdom, Justice and Clemency, entitle him to the Love and Obedi∣ence of his Subjects at Home, as his Resolution and strict Observance of Treaties, have gain'd him the Respect and Esteem of his Allies a∣broad.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“We are commanded by his Majesty to assure you, that he will inviolably preserve our ex∣cellent Constitution both in Church and State; the Continuance of which Blessing is farther se∣cur'd to us by the eminent Virtues of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and by so numerous an Issue as God” has bestow'd upon his Royal Highness.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is with no small Satisfaction that we ob∣serve, the Calm which this Kingdom, hereto∣fore the Scene of so many Rebellions, at pre∣sent enjoys, while the traiterous Enemies to our King, and to our happy Establishment, disco∣ver'd by your early and steady Zeal for the Pro∣testant Succession, have thought fit to change the Place of Action, and attempt elsewhere to di∣sturb his Majesty's Government, whose un∣doubted Right to the Crown of these Realms is founded on the Laws of the Land, and secur'd by the Affections of his People Assembled in” Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="184"/>
<Q>“So desperate and wicked a Design must end in the Confusion of the Persons concern'd in it, and fix his Majesty's Throne upon a surer Foundation, by distinguishing the true Friends to his Royal Person and Government, from the Abettors of Popery and Slavery: Yet your Conduct will not be agreeable to your ac∣custom'd Prudence, if you neglect to put your selves in the best Posture of Defence upon this Occasion; for which Purpose, his Majesty has caused Arms to be delivered out of his Stores to the Militia, and has order'd an Addition to be made to each Company remaining in this Kingdom, 'till such Time as he can replace those Regiments, which the Necessity of his Affairs has oblig'd him at present to draw from hence, to suppress the Rebels in <HI>Great Britain;</HI> wherein your Safety is equally con∣cern'd” with that of his other Subjects.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“We have order'd a State of the publick Accounts, together with the Charge of the Establishment, to be laid before you in the clearest and plainest Light; by which you will judge, what Supplies will be wanting to carry on the Service, and to defray such Ex∣pences as you may think proper for your own Security; nor can we in the least doubt, after so many Proofs of your Affection to his Majesty, but you will cheerfully contribute to the necessary Aids for the Support of a Government, whose Welfare is inseparable from” your own.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="185"/>
<Q>“You may depend upon a just and frugal Ap∣plication of the Money given to the Purpose” for which you design it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>My Lords, and Gentlemen,</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“We have his Majesty's Orders to acquaint you, that he will readily consort to such good Laws, as may conduce to make you an easy and a happy People; and you may be assur'd, that we shall always concur with you in every thing that may be advantageous to the King∣dom; for which end we will willingly receive” your Advice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“We must recommend to you in the present Conjuncture, all reasonable Dispatch in your Proceedings; and such Unanimity in your Re∣solutions, as may once more put an end to all other Distinctions in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but that of Pro∣testant” and Papist.</Q></P>
<P>It will not consist with the needful Brevity of these Annals, to repeat at large the Addresses of this Parliament, as well Lords as Commons; as well to the King, as to the Lords Justices; I therefore purposely omit them, being only Things in Course, and Matter of usual Form, expressing their Zeal for his Majesty's Service, Readiness to do all that was requir'd of them, Thanks for the Speech from the Throne, and the like.</P>
<P>This Parliament being of a much different Sort from their immediate Predecessors in the House, apply'd very early to unravel what had been done in the last Sittings, and to shew their Resentment at some Persons and Proceedings during the late Administration</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="186"/>
First having resolv'd upon the Addresses of Thanks, <HI>as above,</HI> they began in the House of Peers with a Bill for recognizing his Majesty's Title to the Crown; and the Commons having first settled their Committees, began with falling upon the King's Enemies; which produced the several Bills for farther Security of the Person and Government of the King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Bill to attaint the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and give a Reward of <HI>50000l.</HI> for his Head; and for attainting the Duke of <HI>Or∣mond,</HI> giving the Crown his Estate, and <HI>10000l.</HI> Reward upon his Head.</P>
<P>These were follow'd of Course by a Retro∣spect upon the Councils of the last Reign; and a Resolve was pass'd, <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> a∣gainst those who advis'd the Queen to prorogue the late Parliament, at a Time when a Bill to attaint the <HI>Pretender</HI> was depending; and they were unanimously voted to be Enemies to the Succession, and Favourers of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and <HI>Popery.</HI></P>
<P>They proceeded in the next Place to bring in a Bill to prevent Tumults, rebellious and rio∣tous Assemblies; All which Bills, together with the Supplies demanded, went thro the Houses in the usual Form, without the least Opposition; and being ratified in <HI>England,</HI> as the Constitution requires, were finish'd, and receiv'd the Royal Assent; as shall be observ'd in its Course.</P>
<P>But they did not end here; for on the <HI>17th</HI> the Commons, while the publick Accounts, which were order'd to be laid before them, were pre∣paring, enter'd into another Enquiry, which brought a great many of their Members to their <HI>Peccavi</HI> on their Knees. The Case was this: The
<PB N="186" REF="187"/>
last House of Commons in the Queen's Time, running pretty much the same way, had address'd the Queen against Sir <HI>Constantine Phipps,</HI> at that Time Lord Chancellor of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and one of the Lords Justices of that Kingdom, desiring her Majesty to remove him from his Employ∣ment; but as this Address seem'd at that Time not to be very acceptable to her Majesty, or to the Councils of that Reign, there were sundry other and counter Addresses procur'd and sent up from the several Counties and Towns in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> in Favour of Sir <HI>Constantine Phipps;</HI> and desiring that he might not be remov'd, not∣withstanding the said Address of the House of Commons. This the House esteem'd to be a Breach of the Privilege of Parliament; and re∣solv'd to shew their Resentment at the Persons who sign'd those Addresses, especially such as were then Members of the sitting Parliament.</P>
<P>Accordingly they appointed a Committee to enquire what Addresses of that kind were sent up to her late Majesty, and who sign'd them; and they censur'd, or brought to Acknowledgment, a great many Gentlemen upon this Account; and then they address'd the Lords Justices, to issue out a Proclamation against the <HI>Popish</HI> In∣habitants of <HI>Limerick</HI> and <HI>Galway;</HI> It seems, those People in those Towns, presuming upon the Construction they thought fit to put upon the Articles of Capitulation made with King <HI>William,</HI> for the Surrender of those Places, had claim'd or pretended to an Exemption from the Penalties and Process upon the other Laws against <HI>Papists;</HI> upon Complaint whereof to the House, this Address was founded.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="188"/>
In this Current of publick Resentment, doing themselves Justice upon Excursions of the former ruling Party, they forgot not, even a mean News-Writer, one <HI>Richard Pue,</HI> whose Case was as follows.</P>
<P>There was in the latter End of the late Reign a Design much talk'd of, about breaking the <HI>Irish</HI> Army removing the <HI>Whiggish</HI> Officers and Regiments, and the like; which, however pre∣vented, is not our Business to enquire; but it seems it was only talk'd of, not done. But this News-Writer, in a publick Paper of his, call'd <HI>Pue</HI>'s <HI>Occurrences,</HI> almost two Years before this Enquiry, <HI>viz. March</HI> 30, 1714. had printed the following Paragraph as a piece of News.</P>
<P><HI>An Express is sent to</HI> Ireland <HI>for the immediate breaking the following Regiments there,</HI> viz. <HI>the Lord</HI> Mountjoy<HI>'s, Col.</HI> Charles Churchill<HI>'s, Col.</HI> Wade<HI>'s, and Col.</HI> Corbet<HI>'s, being all Foot; Col.</HI> Pepper<HI>'s, and Col.</HI> Kerr<HI>'s Dragoons. The honest People of</HI> Ireland <HI>will suffer by the ill Practices and Designs of their late factious House of Commons, which is a Pity; for these Draw-backs will be</HI> 40 <HI>or</HI> 50000 l. per Ann. <HI>out of that Kingdom's Way, besides the Loss of the Money the said six Regiments would spend in their Country; and another of their Regiments is to be sent to</HI> Port Mahone. <HI>Now, let their Whiggish Cloathiers and Cloth-Workers (instead of Wine every Night, as they had at the late Election for Parliament Men for your City and Country, at the</HI> Scots <HI>Ambassadors on the</HI> Comb,) <HI>drink Taplash, which they may have cheap, since the additional Duty is off.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="189"/>
<Q>This Paper was censur'd in the House to be “a false, scandalous, and malicious Libel, high∣ly reflecting on the Justice and Honour of the late House of Commons of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and or∣der'd the said <HI>Pue</HI> to be taken into Custody of their Serjeant at Arms, for printing the” same.</Q></P>
<P>All this was but the first Week's Work of the House, so vigorously did they go on in their Work. The next Week began with laying be∣fore the House Abstracts of the publick Ac∣counts, and such Things as the House had called for, for their Guidance in the Supply; and the Excise-Bill being pass'd, the Lords Justices came to the House, and gave the Royal Assent to two Bills, Part of those mentioned before, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. An Act for an additional Duty upon Beer, Ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2. An Act to recognize his Ma∣jesty's Titles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The other Bills were not yet ready.</P>
<P>These Things and such like took up so much of their time, that for some Weeks they did little else except the dispatch of the Money-Bills, which indeed went on all the while.</P>
<P>Upon the like re-examination of the Case of Sr. <HI>Dudley Moor,</HI> in the late Reign, they censur'd all the Judges that had any hand in it; the Case was an alledg'd Partiality of the Judges, in Or∣dering the Clerk of the Crown to strike a Jury for that purpose; upon which, first they resolv'd upon the whole Debate, That by the Laws of the Land, and constant uninterrupted Usage of the Court of <HI>King's-Bench,</HI> all Juries in criminal Cases ought to be nominated and returned by the Sheriffs only, unless there be a legal Chal∣lenge
<PB N="189" REF="190"/>
to his or their making such Return. This Resolution stated the Thing as it ought to have been; and then coming to examine how diffe∣rent the Conduct of the People concern'd had been from what, by the Usage of Court, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it ought to have been, they fell upon the Persons themselves in the following Resolu∣tions:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Rule made in the Court of <HI>Queen's-Bench</HI> in the Case of <HI>Dudley Moor,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> where∣by the Clerk of the Crown was required to strike a Jury for his Tryal, was unprecedent∣ed, arbitrary, and illegal, and a high Invasion of the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P><TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>2. That Sir <HI>Richard Cox,</HI> late Lord Chief Justice of the said Court,</CELL>
<CELL ROWS="3"> had, by making such Rule, acted partially, arbitra∣rily, and illegally, and contrary to the Oath and Du∣ty of a Judge.</CELL>

<P><PB N="190" REF="191"/>
This Case is too considerable to be omitted, as it stands as a Precedent upon Record to warn the highest Officers of Justice to act legally and up∣rightly in their Offices.</P>
<P>On the 16th of <HI>January</HI> they adjourn'd, most of the Bills they had depending being pass'd and sent to <HI>England,</HI> for the Council here to approve, as is requir'd by the Constitution of that Con∣quer'd Kingdom.</P>
<P>I go back now to the Affairs of <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Lancashire</HI> or <HI>Preston</HI> Prisoners, being, as is ob∣serv'd before, secur'd, the Noblemen and most of the Gentlemen were Order'd to be brought to <HI>London,</HI> and they set forward accordingly, on the 23d of <HI>November;</HI> they arriv'd at <HI>London</HI> the 9th of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, they were led through the Town as Prisoners, and pinion'd; that is, their Arms bound, as is usual in such Cases: Nor could they be brought in any other Posture with equal Secu∣rity; but this was but from <HI>Highgate</HI> to <HI>London;</HI> all the rest of the Journey they had as much Ci∣vility and good Usage shewn them as they could expect, which many of them have acknow∣ledged.</P>
<P>It is true, the common People in the Streets, as they passed, used them very scurvily, and with Curses, Reproaches, and a thousand Indignities, insulted them at an unsufferable Rate; but as the Guard with them, in the first place, did not en∣courage the People to do it, and were no way in a Condition to prevent it, the Blame of it lies wholly upon the Occasion.</P>
<P>As soon as they were lodg'd, they were all un∣bound; the Noblemen were treated with Ho∣nour
<PB N="191" REF="192"/>
and Respect, at least with Decency, and were lodg'd in the Tower; neither had any of the other Prisoners any Irons put upon them, till their future Conduct made it absolutely ne∣cessary. Several of them were sent for up, after their Commitment, to be examin'd before the Council, and elsewhere; but their Answers seem'd to give no Token of any extraordinary Convi∣ctions on their Minds, but they pleaded they had been led by Principle, or hurry'd into a rash Un∣dertaking; that they were in the Hands of Pow∣er, and must undergo what they were pleased to inflict.</P>
<P>It is true, there was not Room for much to be said, the Fact, for which they were in Cu∣stody, being clear: There needed neither Evi∣dence or Confession as to that Part; to Men taken in Arms, what Accusation could be want∣ing? And as to those few Things the Govern∣ment desir'd to be inform'd of, they did not seem forward to answer; so they were remanded, as Persons the Government had no more to say to, but that they were to be dealt with in a judicial Way, which in the Sitting of the approaching Parliament we shall have farther Occasion to speak of.</P>
<P>From this Tragick Scene, we now cast our Eyes to that part of the Rebellion which still stood upon its Legs in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> as was observ'd before, remain'd at <HI>Perth,</HI> and his Troops canton'd in the Neighbouring Country, as the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> with his little Army, did at <HI>Sterling;</HI> but with this Difference, that the Duke's Army encreased every Day, and the Dutch Troops, especially those who went by Sea, began to arrive; whereas the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s
<PB N="192" REF="193"/>
Men were exceedingly diminish'd by the going off of the Earl of <HI>Seaforth,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Huntley,</HI> and others; tho' it is true, that they made Pro∣mises of returning again with larger Numbers; which Promises, however were never perform'd.</P>
<P>Yet was not the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> altogether with∣out Supports in this Time; for as he was secure from any Attacks from the King's Troops on one hand, the violent Winter forbidding all Action, except by small Parties, for which here was very little Opportunity given; so he was at liberty to send Abroad his Agents, and Officers, by Persuasions, Orders, Menaces and Entreatics, to amass great Sums of Money, as well by Loan as by Cess and Contribution, and likewise great Quantities of Provision; nor was he idle in ma∣king use of the Opportunities he had.</P>
<P>But this was not all; on the 22d of <HI>December,</HI> the <HI>Pretender</HI> himself Landed: He had three Ships in Company, with about 36 Gentlemen, some Arms and Ammunition; but only that one, in which the <HI>Pretender</HI> came, was hear'd of for some Days; which being a small Vessel, but an excel∣lent Sailor, made the Voyage in seven Days from <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to <HI>Peterhead,</HI> near <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> where he came on Shore, with only six Gentlemen in his Retinue.</P>
<P>Now the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> was arriv'd to the Top of his Expectations, and now he persuaded all his Party, that the Time of their Deliverance was come, and that they should be able to Tri∣umph over all their Enemies; and indeed, had the <HI>Pretender,</HI> as was expected, and as the most Part of his Friends at <HI>Perth</HI> had been made to believe; I say had he brought but 10000 Men of good Disciplin'd Troops with him, the Face
<PB N="193" REF="194"/>
of their Affairs would have been very much chang'd: But, instead of this, it is apparent, he was as much surpriz'd that he did not find a very great Army ready to march, as the Army was to find that he had not brought 10000 Men with him; which, it seems, was the Number promised.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pretender</HI> was no sooner arriv'd, and Advice of it sent to the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> then at <HI>Perth,</HI> but he resolved to go and attend him, which he did, with the Earl of <HI>Marischal,</HI> Lieu∣tenant General <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and 20 or 30 Persons of Quality on Horseback, with a Guard of Horse to attend them. The <HI>Pretender</HI> Landing with this small Retinue, as above, pass'd <HI>Incog∣nito,</HI> in Seamens Habits, to <HI>Newburgh,</HI> a House of the Lord <HI>Marischal,</HI> and thro' <HI>Aberdeen</HI> to <HI>Feteresso,</HI> where he continued till the 27th, and where he was met by the Earls of <HI>Mar, Maris∣chal,</HI> and the Company above-mention'd, where he Dress'd and discover'd himself, and began to keep a Court, the Noblemen and Gentlemen be∣ing admitted to kiss his Hand. In his Retinue was the young Lord <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> two <HI>French</HI> Officers, and three <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>He had some light Indisposition while he stay'd there, which proved an Ague, of which he had two Fits; and this detain'd him some Days; but on the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> he removed to <HI>Briechin;</HI> thence, on the <HI>3d,</HI> to <HI>Keinard;</HI> the <HI>4th</HI> to <HI>Glames;</HI> and thence, on the <HI>5th,</HI> to <HI>Dun∣dee,</HI> where he entred the Town on Horseback, the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> being on his Right Hand, and the Earl <HI>Marischal</HI> on his Left, with about 300 Gentlemen more attending him, besides some
<PB N="194" REF="195"/>
Troops, which were for that Day only call'd his Guards.</P>
<P>Here his Friends desiring it, he continued in the open Market-Place on Horseback, to shew himself to the People, who crowded about him, and shouted and kiss'd his Hand, as is usual on such Occasions: After which, he went to .... <HI>Stuart,</HI> Laird of <HI>Garntully</HI>'s House, where he Dined, and also lay there that Night. The next Day, <HI>Saturday</HI> the <HI>7th,</HI> he went to <HI>Castle-lyon,</HI> a Seat of the Earl of <HI>Strathm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re,</HI> where he Din'd, and Lodg'd that Night at Sir <HI>David Triplin</HI>'s: The <HI>8th</HI> being <HI>Sunday,</HI> he went to <HI>Schoon;</HI> and the <HI>9th,</HI> he made his Publick Entry into <HI>Perth:</HI> He made no Stay at <HI>Perth,</HI> but return'd that Night to <HI>Schoon,</HI> except that he had the Curiosity to view some of the Soldiers Quar∣ter'd in the Town, and who were drawn out for him to see: they made a tolerable Ap∣pearance, tho' it was thought the Habit of the <HI>Highlanamen</HI> might at first seem very strange to him.</P>
<P>Before we dismiss this Scene, we must give, at large, those publick Transactions on his Side, on which the Story it self depends, and without which the History would not be compleat; And first, it is to be observ'd, that as soon as the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> was come to <HI>Feteresso,</HI> and they had open'd the first Face of a Court; the first Thing done after the Person was own'd, and known, was, to cause him to be proclaim'd King at the Gates of the House.</P>
<P>Immediately from hence they publish his De∣claration, dated at <HI>Commercy</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and dis∣perse printed Copies of it to be sent all over <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="196"/>
Having begun thus to take upon him the Style and Majesty of a King, it follow'd, that he should receive the usual Homage of Subjects, and exercise the Regal Power: The first he receiv'd by the Addresses of the People, and the second by conferring Titles of Honour.</P>
<P>As to Addresses, the first was from the Epis∣copal Clergy of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and the second from the Magistrates, the Town Council, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the City of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> there having been no other Addresses presented to him in Form.</P>
<P>As to his Acts of Royal Authority which he took upon him, it was to confer Knighthoods, Nobility, and Ecclesiastical Dignities, on such as appear'd zealous for him: But as they all died, and are forgotten, so the Persons them∣selves, doubtless, decline the Honour design'd them.</P>
<P>Being returned to <HI>Schoon,</HI> he settled, and ap∣pointed a Privy-Council, and entred upon a formal Administration of his Affairs, publishing several Proclamations and Orders; as a Pro∣clamation for a Day of Thanksgiving for his Arrival; an Order for Praying for him in the Churches, and dispossessing the Ministers that refus'd it; a Proclamation for summoning a Con∣vention of Estates, an Order for the Currency of Foreign Coins; another for arming all the fencible Men, as usual, from 16 to 60; and lastly, one for his Coronation to be on the 23d of <HI>January;</HI> But he found other Employments for his Thoughts before that Time; and almost all these Proclamations and Orders had little other Ceremony attending them than their first Publication.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="197"/>
We meet with very little farther transacted, after this, till the Motions of the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> began to put them upon serious Reflections on the State of their Affairs; and, upon considering closely whether to stand the Attack of the Royal Army, or provide in Time for their own Safety. Some have said these Things took up long De∣bates; but I have been assur'd, that from the first of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Landing, when they found the <HI>French</HI> declin'd him, and would not venture an open Declaration in his Favour; and he saw how divided, how naked of Defence, and how uncapable of engaging the Royal Army, they were at home, it was no more a difficulty with them, whether they should retreat or no; but it was resolv'd on in the very first Cabinet Consul∣tations, and that all the Appearance of Prepara∣tions for a vigorous Defence, the summoning all their Troops together, the sending Expresses for the Lords, <HI>Seaforth</HI> and <HI>Huntley,</HI> the holding a great Council, and every other Thing that look'd like Resistance, was to amuse the World, and to cover their Resolutions of retiring from the Knowledge of their own People, who, had the least Jealousy of what happen'd afterwards been in their Heads, had been more dangerous to them than the Royal Army.</P>
<P>From this Consideration, we cannot so much wonder at the Cruelty of their firing the Villa∣ges, and burning the Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or say how ri∣diculous it was, when they had no Intentions to fight; the Reason is plain, <HI>viz,</HI> they were un∣der an absolute Necessity of making their own People believe that they resolv'd to fight the Royal Army, and it was not Words that would
<PB N="197" REF="198"/>
do this; they were to make all the visible Ap∣pearances of it; they were to advance their Troops, fortify the Place, and make all the Dis∣positions for Action that they would have done if they really were designing to fight; and there∣fore, nothing could be in a greater Hurry and Bustle, than the People at <HI>Perth</HI> were in for a Week or ten Days before they were to go away; nor was there any thing to be seen but planting of Guns, marking out Breast-works and Tren∣ches; and, in a word, all possible Preparation for Action, insomuch that all our News-Papers, for some Days, assur'd us, that the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s People resolv'd to fight, and were putting them∣selves in a Posture to give the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> a very warm Reception.</P>
<P>All this while the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> was at <HI>Sterling;</HI> and tho' he made no Motion, yet he was far from being idle; his Troops began to encrease: <HI>Newton</HI>'s and <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s Regiments of Dragoons had joyn'd him from <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Regiments were at hand; some of them having already pass'd the Border by Land, and about 2000 of them were arrived by Sea. Ge∣neral <HI>Cadogan</HI> was come, and Major General <HI>Vanderbeck,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops, was also with him. They had view'd the Coun∣try, and had consider'd the Scituation of the Enemy; and being resolv'd to attack the Gen∣tlemen at <HI>Perth,</HI> as soon as the Troops were all joyn'd, let the Frost and the Snows offer what Difficulty they might, he made Preparations for that Purpose.</P>
<P>In the Interval of these things, there hap∣pen'd some small Rencouters between the For∣ces
<PB N="198" REF="199"/>
on both Sides; which, however small, serve to compleat our History of this unhappy Insur∣rection. And first, as to the Motions of the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and the Gentlemen with him in the North, they had frequent Marches and Attempts to engage, between them and the Earl of <HI>Seaforth:</HI> tho' it never came to Blows; at last, by the Interposition of the Lady Dowager of <HI>Seaforth,</HI> a Submission was sign'd by the Earl; and a like Treaty was, with better Effect, con∣cluded also with the Marquis of <HI>Huntley;</HI> for as to <HI>Seaforth,</HI> he fell off, and run to Arms again, to his own Ruine, as shall be related afterward. Thus the Earl of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> and the Noblemen and Gentlemen on the King's Side in those parts, not only kept their Ground, but gain'd very much, and preserv'd all that part of the Country in the King's Interest, till the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI>'s Army came up to them to finish the Work.</P>
<P>From thence we come down to the South, to the Shore of <HI>Fife;</HI> and there the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> order'd one of the Men of War, Lying in <HI>Leith</HI> Road, to stand over towards the other Shore, and see if he could lie near enough to <HI>Brunt Island,</HI> to throw a few Shot into the Town, and batter them a little; the Captain of the Man of War did so, and Cannonaded the Town for an Hour or two; upon which the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s Men quitted the Place, imagining, as was said after∣wards, that as soon as the Cannonading was over, the Captain of the Man of War would at∣tempt to land; and there not being a sufficient Number of Men in the Place to defend it, they resolv'd to abandon it; they left behind them six Pieces of Cannon, being Ship Guns; some Arms, with a good Quantity of Provisions:
<PB N="199" REF="200"/>
Upon Advice of this to General <HI>Cadogan,</HI> who was then at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> he order'd a Detachment of <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops to pass the <HI>Firth,</HI> and take possession of the Place, under the Command of Sir <HI>John Montgomery:</HI> Upon his Arrival, the Rebels quitted likewise all the Towns on the North Side of the <HI>Firth.</HI> They had afterwards a little Skirmish with some of the Dutch Soldiers at <HI>Dysert,</HI> but of no Consequence; Nine of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s Men coming to the Lord <HI>Sinclair</HI>'s Coal-Pits, to fetch Coals to carry to <HI>Perth,</HI> were sur∣rounded by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and, taking Shelter in a House, refus'd to yield, till two of them being kill'd, the rest surrender'd.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, to begin the Year, about the first or second of <HI>January,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> with a good Body of Volunteers, and about 30 or 40 <HI>Dutch</HI> Foot, march'd to attack <HI>Falkland,</HI> an old Royal House of the King's of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but decay'd; the Rebels having Notice of this De∣sign, sent a Body of their Troops into the Place, and with another Party surrounded the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sol∣diers, and about 30 Gentlemen in a Village; the Gentlemen got most of them off, but the Foot were made Prisoners.</P>
<P>Upon this Success of the Rebels, and to re∣strain their Excursions, the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> order'd three Battalions of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Foot to pass the <HI>Firth</HI> at <HI>Queen's Ferry,</HI> and take quarters at <HI>Inner∣keithing, Dumfermling,</HI> and the Towns thereabouts, which perfectly cover'd that part of the Country, and kept the Enemy within Bounds.</P>
<P>The latter end of <HI>December</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops arriv'd, most of them took Post in the Army; there had been a Train of Artillery, and all
<PB N="200" REF="201"/>
Stores suitable to the Service Ship'd at <HI>London,</HI> but had lain Wind-bound at the <HI>Buoy on the Nore</HI> so long, that the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> whose Orders were to Fight without loss of time, thought fit not to run the risque of being disappointed of Cannon, thought convenient to send to <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed</HI> for Ten pieces of Cannon, and four Mortars, which were accordingly sent, 1500 Hor∣ses being furnish'd at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for the bringing them away.</P>
<P>But before they arriv'd, or at least before the Army march'd, the Train arriv'd from <HI>England</HI> also by Sea, and tho' there was no occasion for Guns, yet the Gunners, Engineers, Fire-Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were very much wanted.</P>
<P>As soon as General <HI>Cadogan</HI> came back to <HI>Ster∣ling,</HI> having been at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> some Days, a Great Council of War was held, where it was resolv'd to march with the whole Army, and at∣tack the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI> and all his Forces in their Quarters at <HI>Perth,</HI> or in their Camp, wherever they should be found.</P>
<P>The Measures concerted, the Order of Battle appointed, and Orders were immediately given out to prepare every thing needful against the Time; and because it was found, that the Depth of the Snow, which was in most places two or three Foot thick, would very much retard the March of the Infantry and Cannon, if not make it impracticable; Orders were given to Summon in several Thousands of the Countrymen to re∣move the Snow, and to open a plain Road for the Passage of the Carriages.</P>
<P>On the <HI>21st,</HI> 200 Dragoons were detach'd to∣wards <HI>Perth,</HI> to discover the Country, and see if they could, into the Posture of the Enemy; and

to see in what Condition the Roads were for the Army's passing. Colonel <HI>Ghest,</HI> who commanded this Party, did as he was commanded, and brought back his Account to the General; but knew no∣thing that his advancing had alarm'd the Enemy to that Degree, as to put all the City of <HI>Perth</HI> into a Hurry, some Country People coming in full speed, and telling them, that the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> with all his Cavalry, and 4000 Foot, mounted on Horses, was in full March to attack them; nor was this Fright over, till a Party of Horse being sent to <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> and from thence every way to view the Roads, sent express word, that all was quiet, and that no Enemy appear'd.</P>
<P>On the <HI>24th,</HI> the Duke, with General <HI>Cado∣gan,</HI> and a strong Party of Horse, went out them∣selves to view the Country, and particularly the Roads, which the Workmen were all this while busy in clearing and making good: This March of the Duke caus'd a second Alarm, and made some of their Men, who were in the most ad∣vanced Posts, retire; but the Alarm did not reach to <HI>Perth,</HI> as the other had.</P>
<P>On the <HI>26th,</HI> the Duke order'd two Regiments of Dragoons, and 500 Foot, to advance to <HI>Dumblain,</HI> with Directions to post a strong Party at the demolish'd Bridge of <HI>Down.</HI></P>
<P>The same Day, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>29th,</HI> the Army began their March, and marched to <HI>Dumblam;</HI> the Troops that were at <HI>Dumblain</HI> before, advancing at the same time, came to the old Castle of <HI>Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o,</HI> expecting some Resistance, but they found it abandon'd; the next Morning the same Party, with two Pieces of Cannon, advanc'd upon the Road to <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> to cover the Workmen, who were at Work to clear the Way, and to prevent
<PB N="202" REF="203"/>
their being insulted by the Garison of <HI>Tullibardin.</HI> That Day the Army advanc'd to <HI>Auchteratder;</HI> and here indeed the Rebels having burnt all the Houses, as is said before, the poor Soldiers had cold Quarters, having no Lodging but in the Snow, nor any other Covering but the fine Ca∣nopy of Heaven; or, as the <HI>French</HI> say, <HI>les belles Estoilles,</HI> the beautiful Stars. The one and Thir∣tieth, they pass'd the River <HI>Ern,</HI> and came to <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> the Garison of which was with∣drawn, except 50 Men, who were made Priso∣ners; and here it was, the Duke receiv'd the welcome News, that the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and all his Army, had abandon'd <HI>Perth</HI> the Day before, and were retir'd towards <HI>Dundee.</HI></P>
<P>Though the Army were as keen for Action as could be desir'd; yet as the Soldiers had now lain two Nights in the Snow; for at <HI>Tullibardin</HI> they could not get Shelter for the common Sol∣diers, they were not a little glad of warmer Quarters: The Duke had not the Account till near four a Clock in the Afternoon that the Ene∣my was gone; and therefore it being near dark it was not possible to get there that Day; how∣ever, he detach'd immediately four Squadrons of Dragoons, and 2 Battalions of Foot, to take Pos∣session of the Town, and went himself with them and marching all Night, they enter'd <HI>Perth</HI> by the Light of the Snow about two a Clock in the Morning, at the Head of the Dragoons; the two Battallions having march'd all the Day before, were fatigu'd with the length of the way, and Want of Rest, and could not reach the Place till Ten of the Clock the next Morning; in which had the Enemy had Intelligence, and been nimble enough to have taken the Advantage, the Duke
<PB N="203" REF="204"/>
had been in some Hazard; but they had other Business upon their Hands.</P>
<P>The next Morning, the whole Army decamp∣ed from their cold Quarter, at <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> and, marching with what Speed they could make, ar∣riv'd at <HI>Perth</HI> that Evening, being the <HI>1st</HI> of <HI>Feb∣ruary,</HI> where they had good Quarters.</P>
<P>I have given these Accounts from the most certain Narrations of them which were made publick at that time, even by the Whiggs them∣selves, and even in their very Words, except where the matters themselves may since have regu∣lated those Accounts; so that they cannot al∣ledge my History to be deficient, much less par∣tial in any thing.</P>
<P>The Fatigue which the Army had met with in this march however short, was such, that it was ab∣solutely necessary to give them some rest; and yet the necessity of the Service requir'd they should immediately proceed and follow the Enemy as close at the Heels as possible; especially con∣sidering they had already four Days start of the Royal Army; having quitted <HI>Perth</HI> the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> and it being now the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke therefore set forward again with six Squadrons of Dragoons, three Battalions, and 800 Foot Detach'd out of all the Regiments, and came to <HI>Dundee</HI> the third, the rest of the Army following by more easie marches, came thither the next Day.</P>
<P>From hence sending still Detachments on be∣fore them to pursue on the Road to <HI>Montrose,</HI> some by the way of <HI>Brechim,</HI> others by that of <HI>Aberbrothick,</HI> the Duke with the whole Army marched the fifth; and as they were upon this march, they receiv'd an Account that the <HI>Pre∣tender</HI>
<PB N="204" REF="205"/>
was gone, having taken Shipping at <HI>Mon∣trose,</HI> together with the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> and some others, and left the Army to make the best of their way to the Hills, in order to their Escape from the Royal Army, the Horse being of little or no Use there.</P>
<P>General <HI>Gordon,</HI> the Lord <HI>Tinmouth,</HI> the Earl <HI>Marischal,</HI> and several others, which our common Accounts mentioned to be left to shift for them∣selves, kept with the Army, and continu'd their March to <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> the Foot marching on be∣fore with General <HI>Gordon,</HI> and the Earl <HI>Ma∣rischal,</HI> with about 1000 House, keeping the Rear, to prevent Surprize; nor, if we may be∣lieve their own Relation, was the Earl <HI>Marischal,</HI> and General <HI>Gordon,</HI> in such extraordinary Transports of Anger and Despair, on the News of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Escape; tho' perhaps, they might think fit to act such a Part, for the pre∣sent Occasion: But otherwise there is no Doubt but they were made acquainted with the Design; and, being well assur'd that their own Escape would be in Time provided for, they agreed to take the Hazard for the Service of their Cause, and continue with the Troops till they carry'd them clear of the pursuing Army; and this they did so effectually, as gave the Gentlemen Op∣portunity to make their Escapes afterward at more Leisure, and gave the common People Op∣portunity to disperse, and retire to their Dwel∣lings; so that in all the Pursuit which the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> made, tho' he lost no Time, and har∣rast the Troops very sorely; yet they were not able to overtake any Part of them, nor did they, except such as voluntarily surrender'd, make 100 Prisoners in the whole Pursuit from <HI>Perth</HI> to
<PB N="205" REF="206"/>
<HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Locqubaber,</HI> where they separated: But even after they had so sepa∣rated, they went every Man his own Way qui∣etly enough, till particular Detachments were sent under General <HI>Cadogan,</HI> near two Months after, upon Notice that they had appointed to rally their Forces again.</P>
<P>To confirm this Opinion, it appears, that General <HI>Gordon,</HI> who took upon him the Com∣mand after the Flight of the rest, march'd on to <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> and there, drawing up the Troops together, he pulls out a Paper of Instructions from the <HI>Pretender,</HI> which, as he said, he had Order not to open till he came to that City. In this Paper, the <HI>Pretender</HI> complains of Dis∣appointments from abroad principally, and of the Necessity he was under, for his own Preser∣vation, to leave the Country; that he thanked them for their cheerful Undertaking so hazar∣dous an Enterprize; which, had it been as well seconded by others, who had likewise engaged to do it, might have had better Success: He recommends to them to consult their own Secu∣rity, by keeping together till they can come to such Places, where they may separate without being made a Prey to their Enemies; and encou∣rages them to expect to hear farther from him in a very short Time.</P>
<P>It was the <HI>4th</HI> of <HI>February</HI> that the <HI>Pretender</HI> embarkt, and the <HI>6th</HI> in the Morning they reach'd <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> where their Friends receiv'd them with dejected Countenances, and that with good Reason, considering that they were now like to be call'd to a strict Account for their having formerly entertain'd them after another manner.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207"/>
They had no Time to lose; for the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who made every Day fresh Detachments after them, was at their Heels. On the <HI>7th</HI> in the Morning, they began to march out of <HI>Aber∣deen,</HI> and by two in the Afternoon had entirely quitted it; and here having in the short Time of their Stay, procured three Vessels for car∣rying off more Gentlemen, who resolv'd to escape, those Vessels receiv'd private Orders to meet them to the North of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> under the Shores of <HI>Peterhead, Buchan-Ness,</HI> and other Parts, and about 200 Gentlemen, who were concern'd in that Design, parted from the Army, and march'd in a Body to the Places appointed, where, in several Creeks and Harbours, most of them embarkt, and got off; but one Ship, fall∣ing in with the <HI>English</HI> Cruisers, was oblig'd to stand in again for the Shore, and land their Cargo; yet the Gentlemen, knowing the Coun∣try perfectly well, found means to get Horses again, and make their Way to the Hills after the flying Army; nor did any of them, upon these Occasions, fall into the Hands of the pursuing Army: It was reckon'd that about 140 Gentle∣men made their Escape at that Time, and landed all safe in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>8th,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> arriv'd at <HI>A∣berdeen</HI> with 400 Men; but the rest of the Army not being come up, the Pursuit could not be carry'd on, save that Major General <HI>Evans</HI> was detach'd with 200 Dragoons, and some Foot, to endeavour to cut off their Horse, who still kept in the Rear of their Army, from the rest; and particularly, to follow those two Hundred, who went towards the Sea to embark.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208"/>
General <HI>Evans</HI> did his best to intercept these Gentlemen, and follow'd them to <HI>Frazersburgh,</HI> from thence they were gone to <HI>Bampff,</HI> whither he could not follow, but sent a Detachment of 40 Dragoons, with some Foot to follow them thither: It is true, the Letter which General <HI>E∣vans</HI> sent to the Duke, as it was made publick, does not mention that any were embarkt; but it seems to imply, that it was known to be so, seeing the General would venture to pursue the rest with but 40 Dragoons.</P>
<P>The main Body of the Rebels still kept toge∣ther, the Foot marching in the Van, and the Cavalry in the Rear, to prevent their being at∣tack'd by the small Detachments of Dragoons which follow'd them; and in this Order they march'd thro' <HI>Strath-Spey,</HI> and the Country about the River <HI>Don,</HI> to the Mountains of <HI>Badenoch,</HI> where they rested, being in perfect Safety from the Dragoons, who knew better things than to venture after them thither, those Places not be∣ing practicable for the Horse; and therefore the Duke on the t'other hand, contenting him to spread his Detachments over all the flat Coun∣try, put an end here to the pursuit, and sent a Body of Men to open a Communication with the Earl of <HI>Sutherland</HI> and his Friends at <HI>Inverness,</HI> which was done.</P>
<P>And thus we are come to an end of the Re∣bellion; that is to say, as far as relates to the Action in the Field. The Enemy having little left to do but to separate their Foot, and the Gentlemen to make their Escape beyond Sea in the best manner they could, which however so
<PB N="208" REF="209"/>
many did, that it was unaccountable to think how few fell into the Hands of the King's Offi∣cers after the retreat from <HI>Perth,</HI> the great num∣ber of Gentlemen in Arms being consider'd.</P>
<P>One of the Salleys they made for this pupose, was so very bold, and yet so well executed, that it deserves to be recorded; it was at that time when their Army separated at <HI>Badenoch,</HI> when a certain Number of the Gentlemen, who had made secret Provision for their Escape, receiv'd Advice that two <HI>French</HI> Frigates, one of twenty six Guns, and one of eighteen, were arriv'd for their Relief, and that they would lie in the Road of the <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kneys,</HI> in <HI>Pentland Firth,</HI> till they heard from them. Upon this Advice, the Lord <HI>Duffus,</HI> Sir <HI>Geo. Sinclair,</HI> Lieutenant General <HI>Eclyn,</HI> and about 160 Gentlemen in all, on Horseback, and well mounted, made a Sally from the Hills, and, crossing the Shire of <HI>Murray,</HI> came to the Sea∣side near <HI>Burgh;</HI> where getting ten large Boats, they quitted some of their Horses to their Ser∣vants, and killed the rest, to prevent their falling into the Hands of the Dragoons, so to be used against their Friends. And thus being embark'd, they committed themselves to the Sea, and sailed away for the <HI>Orkneys:</HI> They put in at <HI>Dunbeth,</HI> and 60 of them got there two large Barks, with which they pursued their Voyage, and went all on Board the <HI>French</HI> Frigate of 26 Guns; the rest landed in <HI>Arskerry,</HI> another of the Islands; and having press'd a <HI>Scots</HI> Vessel to carry them to the Place where the other Frigate lay, the Coun∣try began to rise upon them, fearing to be plun∣der'd: But at first, the <HI>French</HI> Ship coming to their Assistance, they were too strong for the
<PB N="209" REF="210"/>
Country People; so secondly, telling them they were all Gentlemen, who were flying for their Lives; that they would hurt no body, and pay for what they had; the Country People acquiesc'd, and let them alone.</P>
<P>The other Ships coming in, they all embark'd, and, as we heard afterwards, they landed at <HI>Gottenbro',</HI> in the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Dominions.</P>
<P>There were yet with the Rebels, the Earls <HI>Marischal, Lithgow, Southesk</HI> and <HI>Seaforth,</HI> who about this Time came to them again; the Mar∣quis of <HI>Tullibardin,</HI> Lord <HI>Tinmouth, Drummond, Pitsligo, Rollo,</HI> &amp;c. Also Sir <HI>Donald Mackdonald,</HI> the Clans of <HI>Glengary, Glenderule, Auchenbroek, Lo∣cheal, Clanranald, Glencoe, Keppoch, Appin, Cameron,</HI> and abundance of <HI>Lowland</HI> Gentlemen; but they were all taken to the Mountains, where they shelter'd themselves from the Pursuers for some Time.</P>
<P>As to the Duke of <HI>Argyle,</HI> having finish'd the Pursuit as above, and Cantoned his Men, he left the Army, which indeed wanted refreshment very sorely; and having made a reparation of Quarters, he left General <HI>Cadogan</HI> to Command them, and came back to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>February;</HI> and was at the great Meeting of the Peers for Election of a Lord of Parliament in the room of the Marquis of <HI>Tweedal</HI> deceased.</P>
<P>The new Choice fell upon the Earl of <HI>Had∣dington.</HI> Here he receiv'd the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> who came now over to the Winning Side, and took the Oaths. And the Duke having been magnificently Entertain'd by the City of <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> set forward for Court, where he arriv'd the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="211"/>
I come back now to the Civil Administration; the Parliament of <HI>Ireland</HI> was in a recess for some time as above; they sat again the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>Ja∣nuary,</HI> where they receiv'd the Bills sent to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> Voted an Association, and to shew their Zeal on account of the Rebellion. They Voted, that whatever Forces his Majesty shall think fit to raise, or whatever Expence his Ma∣jesty should think necessary for the Defence of the Kingdom, they would make good the same, and order'd this to be put into an Ad∣dress.</P>
<P>Also they resolv'd to Address the Lords Ju∣stices, to secure the Persons of all such as they should suspect to be disaffected to the Govern∣ment; also they declare it to be the indispensible Duty of all the Magistrates in that Kingdom, to put the Laws in immediate Execution against all Popish Priests, who shall Officiate contrary to Law; and that those, who neglect the same, shall be look'd upon as Enemies to the Consti∣tution.</P>
<P>The Reason of all these extraordinary Steps at that Time, was an Alarm just then given, both in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>Ireland,</HI> of the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> being preparing a great Power in the Western Ports of <HI>France,</HI> and also in <HI>Spain,</HI> in order to invade the King's Dominions; and that it was expected he would make an Attempt to Land in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well as <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>After this, they renewed the Enquiry into the misbehaviour of their Members in the late Reign, and after but a short Debate, they fell upon the Earl of <HI>Anglesea,</HI> who it seems they had a handle against upon the old Score, <HI>of advising the late</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="212"/>
<HI>Queen to Prorogue the Parliament;</HI> and having first car∣ried the previous Question in their former Sit∣ting on the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> viz. That <HI>whoever advis'd the Queen to Prorogue the Parliament, &amp;c. was an Enemy to the Succession,</HI> they founded ano∣ther Question now, and carried it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That whoever advis'd the irregular breaking great part of the Army in this Kingdom, immediately after the said unseasonable Proroguing the late Parli∣ament, as aforesaid, were Enemies to the Prote∣stant Succession, and design'd to bring in the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and Popery.</P>
<P>The Way being thus clear'd to the Mark they aim'd at, the Question was put, <HI>That it is the Opinion of this House, that</HI> Arthur <HI>Earl of</HI> Anglesey, <HI>was one of the principal Advisers of her late Majesty to prorogue the said Parliament, and break the said Ar∣my; and that therein he gave pernicious Council to her Majesty, and is an Enemy to the King and King∣dom.</HI></P>
<P>There were some Objections offer'd to a ge∣neral Vote of this Nature, as to censuring a Nobleman upon the Word Opinion; and some, who were yet no Friends to the Earl, were, however, against it as Unjust, or, at least, Un∣parliamentary, and would have had the Fact farther enquir'd into, that the Vote might have been thus, <HI>viz. It appears to this House, not, that it is the Opinion of this House:</HI> But the Que∣stion was carried, as it then was, by a great Majority: Upon which they pass'd the second Resolution with less Difficulty, <HI>viz. That an humble Address be presented to his Majesty, that he will be graciously pleas'd, for the Security of his Government, and of the Protestant Interest in</HI> Ire∣and,
<PB N="212" REF="213"/>
<HI>to remove the said</HI> Arthur <HI>Earl of</HI> Anglesey <HI>from his Council and Service in this Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>A Committee being appointed for this Ad∣dress, they order'd, the same Day, the Associ∣ation, enter'd into by both Houses, to be con∣firm'd by an Act of Parliament. It seems to have been the declining to enter into and sign this As∣sociation, which brought this Storm upon the Earl of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> who was otherwise well with the Government, and would have probably had former Things forgotten.</P>
<P>On the <HI>27th</HI> the Lords Justices came to the House, and passing the two following Bills, <HI>(viz.)</HI> An Act for an Additional Duty on Wines, and Strong-Waters, and an Act to Attaint the <HI>Pre∣tender,</HI> they made the following Speech, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>HAVING receiv'd Letters this Morning from <HI>England,</HI> by Express from one of his Majestys Principal Secretaries of State, advising us, that there is reason to believe that this King∣dom will be very suddenly Invaded; we thought it our Duty to communicate the same to you without Loss of Time, that you may take such Measures thereupon, as may best conduce to the Defence and Security of your Country.</P>
<P>Nor have we any room to doubt, after the Assurances you have given in your Addresses, and by your Voluntary Associations, of your sincere and hearty Affection for his Majestys Per∣son and Government, but that you will exert your selves upon this Occasion, in the most ef∣ectual
<PB N="213" REF="214"/>
manner, to defeat so horrid and treason∣able an attempt.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</HI></P>
<P>It will be particularly incumbent on you to take such Resolutions at this Juncture, as may enable us to do what is necessary to put the Kingdom in a sufficient Posture of Defence, with the utmost Expedition.</P>
<P>Whatever Expence shall be made at this Time, will be so much laid out to preserve the whole; and you may depend upon it, whatever Powers you shall entrust us with, shall be made use of with the greatest Fruga∣lity, and for the Purposes only which you design them.</P>
<P>It is with much Satisfaction that we can ac∣quaint you, that his Majesty, upon our Repre∣sentation, has been graciously pleas'd, out of his tender Concern for this Kingdom, to direct, That the several Regiments taken from this Esta∣blishment, shall be paid in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> from the Time of their arrival there.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>As your presence will be absolutely necessary in the Country, we must recommend to you all possible Dispatch in your Proceedings, that you may have an Opportunity of shewing the same Zeal for his Majesty's Service, and the Preserva∣tion of this Kingdom, in your respective Stati∣ons, as you have done conjointly, and with great Unanimity in Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="215"/>
Upon this Speech the House of Commons fell upon the Article with great warmth and affection, and Voted an Address to the King, expressing their detestation of the Rebellion, and assuring his Majesty of their Fidelity to his Person, and Resolution to maintain his Title to the Crown; then they Voted an Address to the Lords Justi∣ces, full of Compliments and Thanks upon their early intimation of those things to the House, and desiring them to raise such Troops as may compleat the Establishment, and as many more as they should think necessary for the Defence of the Kingdom; and promising to make good the Expences; likewise, an Address to desire a Pro∣clamation with <HI>10000l.</HI> Reward for apprehending that Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> if he attempted to Land in that Kingdom; and order'd a Bill to subject the Estates of the <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Nonjurors,</HI> to make full Satisfaction for all the Loss and Damage which any Protestant may suffer by any Insurrection or Invasion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And lastly, an Address that no Popish Soldiers should be suffer'd to List among the King's Troops; after which they were Ad∣journ'd again 'till the <HI>8th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> following.</P>
<P>From their Proceedings therefore I come to the Parliament of <HI>Britain;</HI> who after several Ad∣journments met together the <HI>9th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> the same Year. At their coming together, the King opened the Session with the following Speech.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="216"/>
<HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“THE Zeal and Affection to my Govern∣ment, and the vigilant Care for the Safe∣ty of the Nation, which you have shewn in your respective Counties, have not only fully answered my Expectations, but give me As∣surances, that you are met together resolved to act with a Spirit becoming a Time of com∣mon Danger, and with such a Vigour, as will end in the Confusion of all those, who have openly engag'd in this Rebellion; and in the Shame and Reproach of such as, by secret and malicious Insinuations, have fomented, or, by an avow'd Indifference, encouraged this Trai∣terous” Enterprize.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is, I doubt not, a great Satisfaction to you, to have observ'd, That the Powers you entrusted me with, for the Preservation of the publick Safety, have been employ'd in the most proper and effectual manner, and made strictly subservient to those Purposes only, for which you intended them; and you must have had the Pleasure to reflect with me, that as the Measures taken for our Defence have been just and necessary, so it has pleased the Divine Providence to bless them with a Series of suit∣able Success: And I cannot but take this Op∣portunity, of doing Justice to the Officers and Soldiers of the Army, whose brave and faith∣ful Discharge of their Duty, has disappointed our Enemies, and contributed so much to the” Safety of the Nation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="217"/>
<Q>“I did hope, that the detecting and prevent∣ing the designed Insurrections in some Parts of the Kingdom, and the defeating in others, those who had taken up Arms against me, would have put an End to this Rebellion; but it is plain, that our Enemies, animated by some secret Hopes of Assistance, are still endeavouring to support this desperate Un∣dertaking; and the <HI>Pretender,</HI> as I have Reason” to believe, is now landed in <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is, however, with Pleasure I can acquaint you, that notwithstanding these intestine Com∣motions <HI>Great Britain</HI> has, in some Measure, recover'd its Influence and Reputation Abroad The Treaty for settlsng the Barrier for the <HI>Ne∣therlands,</HI> is now fully concluded, between the Emperor and States General, under my Guar∣ranty. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> has agreed to a Treaty, by which that valuable Branch of our Commerce will be deliver'd from the new Im∣positions and Hardships, to which it was sub∣jected by the late Treaties; and will stand set∣tled for the future, on a Foot more advanta∣geous and certain, than it ever did, in the most floarishing time of any of my Predecessors; and the Treaty for renewing all former Alliances, between the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and the States General, is brought very near to its” Conclusion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“I must rely on your Affection to me, and your Care and Concern for the Safety of the Nation, to grant me such Supplies as may en∣able
<PB N="217" REF="218"/>
me to restore, and to secure the Peace of the Kingdom; and I will order Estimates of the necessary Expences to be laid before” you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Among the many unavoidable ill Conse∣quences of this Rebellion, none affects me more sensibly, than that extraordinary Bur∣then, which it has, and must create to my faithful Subjects: To ease them as far as lies in my Power, I take this first Opportunity of declaring, that I will freely give up all the Estates, that shall become forfeited to the Crown by this Rebellion, to be applied to∣wards defraying the extraordinary Expence, in∣curr'd” on this Occasion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is Matter of the greatest Uneasiness to me, that the first Years of my Reign, the whole Course of which I wish'd to have trans∣mitted to Posterity, distinguish'd by the fair and endearing Marks of Peace and Clemency, should be clouded and overcast with so unna∣tural a Rebellion; which, however impotent and unsuccessful, a due Care may render it in all other Respects, does most sensibly afflict me, by the Calamities it has brought on many of my faithful Subjects, and by those indis∣pensable Returns of Severity, which their Sufferings, and the publick Safety, do most justly call for. Under this Concern, my great∣est Comfort is, that I cannot reproach my self, with having given the least Provocation to that Spirit of Discontent and Calumny, that has
<PB N="218" REF="219"/>
been let loose against me, or the least pretence” for kindling the Flame of this Rebellion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Let those, whose fatal Counsels laid the Foundation of all these Mischiefs, and those whose private Discontents and Disappoint∣ments, disguised under false Pretences, have betrayed great Numbers of deluded People in∣to their own Destruction, answer for the Mi∣series in which they have involv'd their Fellow-Subjects. I question not, but that, with the Continuance of God's Blessings, who alone is able to form Good out of Evil, and, with the cheerful Assistance of my Parliament, we shall in a short Time, see this Rebellion end, not only in restoring the Tranquility of my Government, but in procuring a firm and lasting Establishment of that excellent Con∣stitution in Church and State, which it was manifestly designed to subvert: And that this open and flagrant Atempt, in Favour of <HI>Po∣pery,</HI> will abolish all other Distinctions among us, but of such as are zealous Assertors of the Liberties of their Country, the present Esta∣blishment, and the <HI>Frotestant</HI> Religion, and of such as are endeavouring to subject the Na∣tion to the Revenge and Tyranny of a <HI>Popish”Pretender.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After this Speech, and the usual Addresses of Thanks from both Houses, the House of Commons fell immediately to work upon the Enquiry into the Prisoners of State; for the Military Power having now almost finished that part which be∣long'd to it in the Field, the next Scene will be

of Course the Judicial Proceedings against the unhappy remains of the Rebellion which were fallen into their Hands.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nicholas Lechmere</HI> made the first Motion in the House; and after a long Speech intimating what he aim'd at, the House Resolv'd <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> to Impeach the Lords in the Tower of High-Treason.</P>
<P>I have not room to run thro' the former, ei∣ther of Voting these Impeachments, or carrying them up to the House of Lords; 'tis enough to mention, that they were all Impeach'd at the Bar of the House of Lords, and immediately Articles were found against them, and exhibited in Form, and being Engross'd, were carry'd to the Lords the same Night.</P>
<P>Such a Days Work has hardly been seen in the House of Commons of many Years past; and the Warmth of the Proceeding might easily di∣ctate to the Imprison'd Lords, what they had to expect, and that no Time would be lost in their Prosecution, as it farther immediately appeared, for the very next Day, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> the impeach'd Lords were all brought up to the Bar of the House of Lords, where the Articles of Impeachments against them were read, and Co∣pies of them were ordered to be deliver'd to them, and they were orderd to put in their An∣swer in six Days, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>16th;</HI> and upon their Request, that such Persons as were proper to as∣sist them in their said Answer and Defence, might be admitted to come to them, it was immediately granted by the House.</P>
<P>The Impeachments being lodg'd, the Com∣mons went upon other Business, and first or∣der'd a Bill to be brought in, to continue the
<PB N="220" REF="221"/>
Suspension of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act for six Months longer; and then resolv'd, that Mr. <HI>Forster,</HI> Knight of the Shire for the County of <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI> who had been in actual Rebellion against the King, and was then a Prisoner for the same, should be expell'd the House, which was done; and, on a new Election for that County, Sir <HI>John Delavall</HI> was chosen in his stead.</P>
<P>The <HI>16th,</HI> being the Day appointed for the Answer of the impeach'd Lords, they Petitioned for longer time, which was granted them, but only to the <HI>19th;</HI> when they were brought to the Bar, where they all severally pleaded guilty to the Charge, except the Earl of <HI>Winton,</HI> who, upon his Petition, had Time given him till the <HI>23d</HI> to put in his Answer.</P>
<P>The several Pleas of the impeach'd Lords, their Submission, their Application for Mercy, with their Speeches at the Bar, when they were brought up to hear and receive Judgment, toge∣ther with the Speech of the Lord Chancellor <HI>Cowper,</HI> Lord High Steward for the Day, when he pronounc'd the Sentence of Death against them, are made publick, and are too long for these Memoirs.</P>
<P>Upon the Lords having thus pleaded guilty, the House sent a Message the next Day, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>20th,</HI> to the House of Commons, to acquaint them with it; upon which the whole House went the <HI>23d</HI> in the Morning, with their Mace, and with their Speaker, and all their usual Attend∣ants, to the Bar of the House of Lords, to de∣mand Judgment against the said Lords.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="222"/>
In this Interval News came of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s being Landed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the King acquaint∣ed the House of it in the following Speech, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“I Had Reason to believe, when I spoke last to you, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> was Landed in <HI>Scot∣land;</HI> the Accounts I have received since do put it beyond all doubt, that he is Head∣ing the Rebellion there, and does assume the Style and Title of King of these Realms; his Adherents do likewise confidently affirm, that Assurances are given them of Support from Abroad. This Parliament hath on all Occasi∣ons expressed so much Duty to Me, and so true a Regard for the Religious and Civil Rights of my People, that, I am perswaded, this daring Presumption of our Enemies will heighten your just Indignation against them, and beget such farther Resolutions as, with the Blessing of God,” will enable me to defeat their Attempts.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“The most effectual Way to put a speedy End to these Troubles, will be to make such a Provision as may discourage any Foreign Power from assisting the Rebels; I do there∣fore hope, that every sincere <HI>Protestant</HI> and true <HI>Britain,</HI> will look upon the extraordinary Expence, which a timely Preparation may re∣quire, to be the best Husbandry; since it will in all humane Probability, prevent that Deso∣lation and those Calamities, which would un∣avoidably ensue, if the Rebellion should be
<PB N="222" REF="223"/>
suffered to spread, and be supported by <HI>Popish”</HI> Forces from Abroad.</Q></P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“The World must be convinc'd by all you have already done, that you have nothing but the Honour and Interest of your Country at Heart; and for my own Part, I rely entirely upon you, and doubt not but you will take such Resolutions at this Juncture, as will be most for the present Safety, and future Ease of” my People.</Q></P>
<P>This we might be assured would rather quicken than delay the Fate of the Impeached Lords; they had indeed cast themselves upon the King's Cle∣mency, and receiv'd Sentence of Death; and great application was made to the King for their Par∣don, even the House of Lords were brought to take part in the intercession, which however the King did not think fit to grant, and it was thro' the Debates running so high upon that Subject, rather hasten'd the Fate of those, who it was en∣deavour'd to save.</P>
<P>The Question was for some time Debated, Whether it was in the King's Power to Reprieve or no in the Case of a Sentence upon an Im∣peachment. But this being carried in the Affir∣mative, the Grand Motion followed in the House of Lords, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That an Address be pre∣sented to his Majesty to grant a Reprieve to the Lords who lay in the Tower under Sentence of Death. There were long Debates upon this Sub∣ject, and the Terms of the Address took up some time; but that being agreed on, it was put to
<PB N="223" REF="224"/>
the Vote, <HI>to be</HI> presented, <HI>or not</HI> presented, and carry'd TO BE <HI>presented</HI> by five Voices, and no more; accordingly it was presented the same Night, being the <HI>22d</HI> of <HI>February;</HI> and the King gave an Answer, which evidently signified that his Majesty was not well pleas'd with these Pro∣ceedings, and by which the Lords concern'd might easily see what they were to expect. The King's Answer was: <HI>That on this and all other Oc∣casions, he would do what he thought most consistent with the Dignity of his Crown, and the Safety of his People.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day, being the <HI>23d,</HI> the Effect of this Resentment was more plainly seen, when the Orders were past in Council for Executing Three of the Condemned Lords, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earl of <HI>Derwentwater,</HI> Earl of <HI>Nithisdale,</HI> and the Vis∣count <HI>Kenmure,</HI> Reprieving the other Three till the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>March;</HI> The Dislike of these Proceed∣ings was farther seen in about four or five Days after; for the Order for Executing the Lords was not past in Council without some warm Words; and the Lord President, who had influenc'd the Vote in the House of Peers so much, fail'd not to offer the like at the Council-Board: But it ended in a different manner here, the whole storm of it falling upon the E. of <HI>Nott....m</HI> and his Family; for his Lordship was remov'd from his Post of Lord President of the Council, as was also his Son from being one of the Treasury; his Brother the Earl of <HI>Aylesford,</HI> was remov'd from being Chancellor of the Dutchy of <HI>Lancaster;</HI> and the Lord <HI>Guernsey,</HI> eldest Son to the Earl of <HI>Aylesford,</HI> from being Master of the Jewel-Office; as also Sir <HI>Roger Mostyn,,</HI> who marry'd the Earl of
<PB N="224" REF="225"/>
<HI>Nottingham</HI>'s Daughter, from being one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>This, however, was not done till the Lords were Executed; that is to say, two of them; for the Earl of <HI>Nithisdale,</HI> happily for him, a∣voided the Blow, by getting out of the Tower in Disguise the very same Night, and within a very few Minutes after he had Notice, that he must die the next Morning.</P>
<P>According to this Order of Council, early the next Morning we saw the Scaffold on <HI>Tower-Hill</HI> surrounded with the Horse-Guards, Horse-Grenadiers, and a Detachment of Foot; and a little before Ten a Clock, the Earl of <HI>Derwent∣water,</HI> and the Lord Viscount <HI>Kenmure,</HI> were carried in a Hackney-Coach from the <HI>Tower</HI> to the <HI>Transport-Office</HI> on <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> where there was a Room hung with Black for their Reception; and there was a Passage, or Gallery, rail'd in, which led from thence to the Scaffold, which was also cover'd with Black; and where, after a De∣cent time for their preparation, they were both Beheaded.</P>
<P>These two Lords being thus cut off, and the third fled, the Hand of Justice staid a while; the other Three were respited from time to time, and remain still in the Tower. The Earl of <HI>Nithisdale</HI> having escaped, an Advertisement of his Escape was publish'd in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> and a Reward of a <HI>Thousand Pounds</HI> offer'd to any one who should apprehend him; but there was soon after an Account from <HI>France,</HI> of his being safely landed there, and that he was seen at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Course of Things now brings the Civil and Military Matters to join in History; for the
<PB N="225" REF="226"/>
<HI>Pretender</HI> being gone, as has been related, the King came to the House on the <HI>17th,</HI> of <HI>Feb∣ruary,</HI> and gave the Parliament an Account of it in the following Speech.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“I Take this Opportunity of acquainting you, that my Forces have oblig'd the <HI>Pretender</HI> to fly out of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and he is since, as I am in∣formed, landed near <HI>Gravelines:</HI> But I don't yet know, whether any Country in Amity with us, will give him Protection, after having so” publickly invaded our Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The Dangers to which the Nation was ex∣posed, made me determine, that neither the extraordinary Rigour of the Season, nor any falacious Proposal of the Rebels, should divert me from using all possible Endeavours towards putting a speedy and Effectual End to this un∣natural” Rebellion.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“I must return you my Thanks for the great Progress you have made in the Supplies. The necessary Dispositions are made for raising Ad∣ditional Forces: But as I shall always consult the Ease of my People, as far as it is consist∣ent with their own Security; I shall not make Use of the Confidence you have placed in me, unless the restless Malice of our Enemies should make it necessary to go on with those” Levies.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="227"/>
<HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“I promise my self, from the Zeal and Wis∣dom of this Parliament, that the future Hap∣piness and Tranquility of my Subjects will be establish'd on a solid Foundation; and such Measures taken, as may deprive our Enemies at Home of the Power, (since that alone can deprive them of the Inclination) again to at∣tempt the Disturbance of my Government. This therefore is what I think my self oblig'd to recommend to you, as a Deliberation of the utmost importance to the future Safety, Ease” and Prosperity of my People.</Q></P>
<P>Immediately upon this Speech, the Lords and Commons severally voted Addresses of Thanks and Congratulation, as usual: Both which, be∣ing in the usual Form, we leave out for want of Room, that we may not thrust out things of more Importance.</P>
<P>There was little remaining now to do, as to the Rebellion, except the punishing, and pur∣suing the Rebels; those who were fallen into their Hands, we shall soon see brought to Justice, by judicial Process; those who could not be ta∣ken, the King pursu'd to the utmost; at Home, by his Forces; Abroad, by his Influence.</P>
<P>The Judicial Proceedings went on all this while in the Inferior Courts, and a Commission of Oyer and Terminer was granted to Judges appointed for the Tryal of such of the <HI>Preston</HI> Prisoners as were confin'd in <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Chester</HI> Castles, of whom mention was made above.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="228"/>
The Judges appointed for this Work were, Mr. Baron <HI>Bury,</HI> Mr. Justice <HI>Eyre,</HI> and Mr. Baron <HI>Montague.</HI></P>
<P>They set out for <HI>Liverpool</HI> with all their At∣tendants on the 4th of <HI>January,</HI> and arriv'd there the 11th, when the very next Day they opened their Commission, having first been at the Church, and heard a Sermon. In order to open their Sessions, the Grand Jury was sum∣mon'd; and the proper Informations having been laid before them, Bills of Indictment were found against 48 of the Prisoners by Name. <HI>It is to be Noted here,</HI> that there had been Com∣missioners formerly appointed to take Deposi∣tions with Relation to the Fact at <HI>Preston,</HI> and these Depositions were sufficient for the Infor∣mation of the Grand Jury, and to satisfy them in finding the Bills, tho' upon the Tryals the Witnesses were produced in Court, as is usual in such Cases.</P>
<P>The Bills being found, Copies of the Indict∣ment were deliver'd to the Persons, and the Court adjourn'd for 8 Days, <HI>viz.</HI> to the 20th of <HI>January,</HI> to give the Prisoners the legal Time to prepare for their Defence. In the mean time, other Prisoners had been order'd from <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Chester</HI> to <HI>Liverpool,</HI> and were arriv'd there, where Copies of the Indictments were also seve∣rally deliver'd to them, the Grand Jury having in that Interval found Bills again 113 more, where∣of 40 were <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>The Tryals begun with <HI>Englishmen,</HI> of whom, on the <HI>20th,</HI> five were brought to Tryal, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

It was in the next place in course to go to Work with the <HI>Preston</HI> Prisoners at <HI>London;</HI> there had for some time been a Dispute about Trying them in <HI>London,</HI> or whether they must be carried down into <HI>Lancashire</HI> to be Tryed, where the Fact was committed. But a Clause in an Act of Parliament regulated this, and a Commission of Oyer and Terminer was granted to Try them in <HI>London.</HI> Accordingly, on the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> the Judges sat in the Common-Pleas Court at <HI>West∣minster,</HI> where Bills were found against some of them, and they were Arraigned, and had time given them to prepare for their Tryals. The Grand Jury of <HI>Surry</HI> at the same time found Bills against others of them, <HI>(viz.)</HI> such as were Prisoners in the <HI>Marshalsea.</HI></P>
<P>In the interval between the Grand-Jury's find∣ing the Bills, and the Prisoners being brought to the Bar to be Arraign'd, Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> the Head of the <HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Preston</HI> Army gave them the flip; for having obtain'd the Favour not to be Lodg'd in the Press-yard at Newgate, but in the Keeper's House, he put a Trick upon his Keeper's Man, by sending him down Stairs into the Cellar to draw Beer, and having fasten'd him down by the Stair-head Door, and having prepar'd a Counterfeit Key to the main Door, he let himself out, and then putting the Key in∣to the Door again on the outside, he double lock'd the Door, and left the Key in it; so that the Keeper Mr. <HI>Pitts,</HI> tho' he had presently dis∣cover'd it, could not get out to pursue him 'till it was too late: It was afterwards known that Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> had convey'd himself down to <HI>Leigh</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> where a Vessel lay ready for him, which
<PB N="233" REF="234"/>
carry'd him to <HI>France,</HI> and Landed him so hap∣pily, that in 24 Hours he was a Prisoner in <HI>New∣gate,</HI> and a Freeman in <HI>Calais.</HI> There was a Proclamation immediately publish'd, with a Re∣ward of a Thousand Pound for Apprehending him, but he was out of their reach; this was the <HI>14th</HI> of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this all, for a few Days after, and just the Evening before the Tryals were to begin, there had like to have been a general Goal-De∣liver at Newgate; for old Brigadier <HI>Mackintosh,</HI> who saw that Mr. <HI>Forster</HI> being gone, he was like to be the first Man to be made an Example of, broke out of Newgate; not by slight, as the other had done, but by meer Force, knocking down the Keepers, breaking thro' the Soldiers, and taking the Keys from the Turn-Key who kept the Door. This was done with such despe∣rate Courage, and he was so well Seconded by his Fellow-Prisoners, that above 30 of them got out of the Prison, into the Keeper's House, and about 17 of them, quite out of the Keepers Door.</P>
<P>The Old Brigadier got quite off, with 7 more, but the rest taking the wrong way in the Court, after they were out, and not able to find their way into the Street, were taken again. The Names of those who escaped were</P>

Upon his not having acted but as a Mediator, to bring them to Sur∣render. And, (2.) upon the yielding at Dis∣cretion, being to be understood to be a Capitula∣tion for Life. But the Generals and Officers proving, that no Promises of Life were made; the Jury brought him in <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>He was likewise told by the Court, that a Man being found among Rebels, any Way aid∣ing, abetting, comforting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> though he was not actually in Arms, or committed Hosti∣lities, yet it was Treason within the Law; and that the part of a Mediator, as it shew'd the Confidence the Rebels plac'd in him, so it was prov'd he Capitulated for himself, as well as the rest.</P>
<P>We set these things down more particularly in this Gentleman's Case; because this, of ha∣ving Capitulated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Plea of being Forced into the Rebellion, was the Substance of what was pleaded by most of the rest, whose
<PB N="235" REF="236"/>
Arguments we cannot pretend to repeat as they were pleaded, the Numbers being so great.</P>
<P>The next Day, being the <HI>8th,</HI> the Court sat at the Marshalsea In Southwark, where Mr. <HI>James Hume</HI> was Try'd, and found Guilty.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Farquarson</HI> was Try'd, and acquit∣ted.</P>
<P>On the <HI>11th,</HI> Mr. <HI>Alex. Menzies</HI> was try'd, and pleaded very hard his being forc'd, as above, into the Rebellion; but he was found Guilty, after a very long Defence.</P>
<P>The same Day that Mr. <HI>Menzies</HI> was Try'd, Colonel <HI>Oxburgh</HI> was executed; he was the first that was singled out for an Example.</P>
<P>On the <HI>12th</HI> five more were brought to Tryal, and pleaded Guilty; their Names were,</P>

<P>Upon the acquitting the last two Men above∣to be clear'd, the common People offer'd divers Insults to the Court, and to the Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges; upon which the Judges caused two of the Principal to be laid hold of, and brought into Court, where they were fin'd, and imprison'd; one was a Tallow-Chandler at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> who was sin'd a Hundred Pound, and order'd to lie in Prison a Twelve Month: The other, a Looking-Glass-Maker on <HI>London-Bridge,</HI> who was fined Fifty Pounds, and likewise a Years Imprisonment; but the latter, upon his Submission and Acknow∣ledgment, was some Months afterwards excused.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="237"/>
Mr. <HI>Townley</HI> being acquitted, was immediate∣ly discharged; and going down to a Friend's House in <HI>Sussex,</HI> he was apprehended there again, though on no new Occasion, and brought up a∣gain; but the Government having no Charge upon him again, dismiss'd him.</P>
<P>The next Day, being the <HI>16th,</HI> the Court sat at <HI>Westminster,</HI> where <HI>Thomas Hall</HI> of <HI>Otterburn,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in <HI>Northumberland,</HI> lately in Commission of the Peace; and <HI>Robert Talbot,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> were Try'd, and found Guilty.</P>
<P>Soon after them, Mr. <HI>Gascoigne</HI> was Try'd; who made a very great Defence, and the Tryal took up some Time; they were at last all found Guilty.</P>
<P>On the 28th were Try'd at <HI>Westminster</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nicholas Wogan, Lancelot Macking tosh,</HI> Esqrs;</P>
<P><HI>Charles Ratcliff,</HI> Brother to the Earl of <HI>Derwent∣water,</HI> and</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Blair.</HI></P>
<P>The last retracted his forme Plea, and desir'd Leave to plead Guilty, which was granted; and the Three former were found Guilty by the Jury.</P>
<P>There were no more Tryals for some Days; the Courts being adjourn'd till after <HI>Whitsontide,</HI> the rest of the Prisoners Condemn'd, were all Re∣priev'd, except Mr. <HI>Gascoigne,</HI> who was executed the <HI>25th</HI> at Tyburn.</P>
<P>The vigorous Prosecution and Punishment of these Men, alarm'd the Party, and gave Ground to expect a farther Course of judicial Proceed∣ings; as was also visible from the strict Enquiry into other Things and Persons: For Example, That of Committing Mr. <HI>Harvey</HI> of <HI>Comb</HI> to
<PB N="237" REF="238"/>
Newgate, who had formerly been some Time in a Messenger's Hands; and of finding a Bill against the Dord <HI>Lansdown,</HI> and another against one Mr. <HI>Francia,</HI> a Jew.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the Act empowring his Majesty to detain such People as he should suspect, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> commonly call'd, <HI>suspending the Habeas Corpus Bill,</HI> drew near an End; and as the Court did not seem to desire its Continuance, those who had been detain'd, but without any Charge brought against them, began to hope for their Liberty, and to prepare to bring their <HI>Habeas Corpus.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>24th,</HI> the very Day that the Act ex∣pir'd, the Earl of <HI>Scarsdale,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Du∣plin,</HI> brought their <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and were ad∣mitted to Bail before Mr. Baron <HI>Bury.</HI> On the <HI>26th,</HI> the Lord <HI>Powis,</HI> commonly call'd Duke of <HI>Powis,</HI> did the same; as did also several private Gentlemen, both here and in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>30th,</HI> the Court of Justice renew'd their Sitting at the Marshalsea in Southwarh; where <HI>John Dalton,</HI> and <HI>William Tonstall,</HI> Esqrs; were brought to the Bar; the last pleaded Guilty, and the first was Try'd, and found Guilty by the Jury,</P>
<P>The Month of <HI>July</HI> began with the Escape of two more of the Prisoners out of Newgate, viz, <HI>Angus Mackintosh,</HI> and <HI>James Mackquean;</HI> a third attempted the like, but was known, and stopt by the Centinels, who were posted at the Door of the Prison.</P>
<P>On the <HI>4th,</HI> the Court of Justice sat again at <HI>Westminster,</HI> where</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239"/>
<HI>Richard Buttler, James Swinburn, Edward Swin∣burn,</HI> were Try'd, and found Guilty.</P>

<P>29th,<HI>—Thornton,</HI> pleaded Guilty.</P>
<P><HI>James Cornwal</HI> was Try'd, and found Guilty; but recommended by the Jury to his Majesty's Mercy.</P>
<P>And Mr. <HI>James Menzies</HI> of <HI>Culdare,</HI> formerly mention'd, pleaded the King's Pardon.</P>
<P>Abundance of these Prisoners besides those al∣ready named, made their escape out of <HI>Newgate,</HI> and the <HI>Marshalsea,</HI> as out of the Prisons in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> but as Mercy began now to take place, it was not look't upon as considerable, no more Proclamations were issued to apprehend them.</P>
<P>There was a general Order to set all those at Liberty in <HI>Scotland,</HI> without Bail, who surren∣der'd

according to Summons before the Rebel∣liou; as also all those, who, having been in the Rebellion, deserted from the Rebels before the Rebels were retreated from <HI>Perth;</HI> and after∣wards, for discharging all the Servants, who were Prisoners with their Masters in <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>I come back now to the Proceedings in the Parliament, as well <HI>British</HI> as <HI>Irish;</HI> in the first of these the Earl of <HI>Winton</HI> took his Tryal, and after some small struggles was found Guilty by his Peers, and receiv'd Sentence of Death; but his Lordship sav'd his Friends the Trouble of

Soliciting for, and the Government of exerting their Mercy, by making his Escape out of the Tower; which however he was blam'd for, seeing it was said the Government enclin'd to have been very kind to him.</P>
<P>And now to end the Judicial part at once; the House went upon two Bills, which closed the Scene of Justice <HI>(viz.)</HI> one to attaint all the Per∣sons in the Rebellion, as well those taken, as those who were not taken; and the next was to cause all the Estates forfeited by the attainted Gentlemen, to be seiz'd for the use of the pub∣lick, and naming Commissioners for enquiring into their value, and disposing of them. Those Commissioners I shall have occasion to speak of hereafter pretty often; their Names are,</P>

<P>There was one great struggle yet in Parlia∣ment, after which Things began to draw to∣wards a Close; and this was the Proposal; To bring in a Bill to prolong the Time for the Sit∣ting of the Parliament. It was well known the Parliament could by Virtue of the Triennial Law subsist but three Years; but it was thought convenient for divers reasons of State, not to acquiesce in the Circumstances; and therefore a Bill was offered to continue the Parliament then Sitting to a farther Time, <HI>(viz.)</HI> for Seven Years.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="242"/>
This Bill was first brought into the House of Lords, where after long struggles, and two Pro∣tests it was pass'd in the Committee 96 against 61, and at last in the House by 69 against 36. In the House of Commons it was not so much con∣tended, where the Difference being at highest, was 284, against 162.</P>
<P>After this the Houses had little of Moment before them, except what they call winding up their bottom; that is to say, passing the Bills which were depending in the House, which be∣ing all brought to perfection by the latter end of <HI>June</HI> the King came to the House the <HI>26th,</HI> and passing all their Bills, put an end to the Ses∣sion with the following Speech.</P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“I Cannot put an End to this Session, with∣out expressing to you my Satisfaction in the Proceedings of this Parliament. The wholsome and necessary Laws which have been passed with so much Steadiness, Resolu∣tion, and Unanimity, will (I trust in God) answer those good Ends, which, it is evident, you have had in View, by defeating the De∣signs, and reducing the Spirit of our Enemies; by encouraging our Friends, and raising the Credit and Reputation of the Nation Abroad to such a Degree, as that I may reasonably ex∣pect the Fruits of a settled Government, espe∣cially being supported by a Parliament, zealous for the Prosperity of their Country, and the” Protestant Interest of <HI>Europe.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“I am confident, my Conduct hitherto in suppressing the Rebellion, and punishing those
<PB N="242" REF="243"/>
concern'd in it, has been such as demonstrates, that I desire rather to lessen their Numbers, by reclaiming them, than by making Examples; but I am sorry to find, that the numerous in∣stances of Mercy which I have shewn, have had no other Effect, than to encourage the Faction of the <HI>Pretender</HI> to renew their Insults upon my Authority, and the Laws of the Kingdom, and even to affect, with the greatest Insolence, to distinguish themselves from my good and faithful Subjects; acting with such Folly and Madness, as if they intended to con∣vince the World, that they are not to be re∣duced to Quiet and Submission to my Govern∣ment, by such gentle Methods as are most a∣greeable” to my own Inclinations.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“I return you in particular, my Thanks for the Supplies you have given; which although they fall short of the Sums you found neces∣sary, and have Voted for the Service of the whole Year, yet by the Encouragement you have given to make them effectual, may, I hope, be so managed, as to carry on the cur∣rent” Service till another Session of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”<HI>My Lords and Gentlemen.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“I am very sensible, there are Matters of great Consequence still depending before you; but as they have hitherto been postpon'd, out of absolute Necessity, by intervening Affairs of a more pressing Nature, and of the most immediate Concern to the Peace and Safety of the Nation; I thought the Season of the Year requir'd I should defer your further Pro∣ceedings
<PB N="243" REF="244"/>
till the next Session, rather than you should be retained out of your respective Coun∣tries longer than could be consistent with your” private Consent.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“I am very sensible, there are Matters of great Consequence still depending before you; but as they have hitherto been post-pon'd, out of absolute Necessity, by intervening Affairs of a more pressing Nature, and of the most im∣mediate Concern to the Peace and Safety of the Nation; I thought the Season of the Year required I should defer your further Proceed∣ings till the next Session, rather than you should be detained out of your respective Coun∣tries longer than could be consistent with your” private Consent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I cannot doubt that, during this Recess, you will all use your best Endeavours to pre∣serve the Peace of the Kingdom, and to dis∣courage and suppress all manner of Disorders; since as the first Scene of the late Rebellion was open'd and usher'd in by Tumults and Riots; so you may be assured, upon what Pretence soever they are raised, they can have no other Tendency, but to support the Spirit of a Faction, restless and unwearied in their Endeavours to renew the Rebellion, and to subvert the Religion, Laws, and Liberties” of their Country.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“I design to make Use of the approaching Re∣cess to visit my Dominions in <HI>Germany,</HI> and to provide for the Peace and Security of the

An Act for Naturalizing <HI>Erengard Melosine,</HI> Ba∣roness of <HI>Schulenburg.</HI></P>
<P>After this the Lord Chancellor by the King's Command, Adjourn'd the House to the 7th of <HI>August,</HI> next following.</P>
<P>As to the Parliament of <HI>Ireland,</HI> they went on as before, proceeding with great rigor against the Miscarriages of the former reign, bringing their own Members (especially) to Submissions and Censures, and also several others.</P>
<P>I have given some account of their Resent∣ment against those who Address'd in favour of Sir <HI>Constantine Phipps,</HI> and who advis'd the Queen to prorogue the Parliament. Now they fell on the Affair of choosing Officers for the City of <HI>Dublin;</HI> in which Case, the Judges, their whole Court, and all the City Magistrates came under Censure of Parliament on that account.</P>
<P>First they Resolv'd, That soon after the Ar∣rival of Sir <HI>Constantine Phipps,</HI> late Lord Chan∣cellar, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Year 1710. a Design was form'd, and carry'd on, to subvert the Consti∣tution, and Freedom of Elections of Magistrates of Corporations, in order to procure Persons to be return'd for Members of Parliament, disaf∣fected to the Settlement of the Crown on his Majesty, and his Royal Issue: and that, in pur∣suance of that Design, indirect and illegal Me∣thods were taken to subvert the ancient and legal Course of electing Magistrate in the City of <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>That, in pursuance of that Design, they pro∣cured, in less than five Months, in the Year 1711.
<PB N="247" REF="248"/>
six Aldermen duly elected Lord Mayor, and four∣teen substantial Citizens duly elected Sheriffs, to be disapprov'd, on pretence that the senior Al∣derman ought to be elected.</P>
<P>That the said senior Alderman had no Right to be elected, either by Charter, Usage, or any By-Law in force in the said City.</P>
<P>That in the Year 1713, they set up a pretended Custom or Usage, for the Mayor in being to no∣minate three Persons, one of whom the Aldermen were obliged to chuse for Lord Mayor.</P>
<P>That the Lords Justices and Council, by their Resolution of the 4th of <HI>September,</HI> 1713. con∣firm'd, and encourag'd that pretended Custom as Legal.</P>
<P>That the Citizens of <HI>Dublin</HI> are in no sort li∣mited in their Choice, as is pretended by the said Custom; but that the Right of nominating the three Persons to be put in Election for Lord Mayor, is in the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City.</P>
<P>Upon these Resolutions, the House censur'd Sir <HI>Samuel Cook,</HI> then Lord Mayor of <HI>Dublin,</HI> for <HI>holding over,</HI> as it was call'd; that is, exercising the Office after his Year was expir'd, till another was chose and approved; and the Aldermen, <HI>Constantine, Mason, Town,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> for join∣ing with him; these last they voted Enemies to the Constitution, and the Protestant Successi∣on, Betrayers of the Liberties of the City, and Friends to <HI>Popery</HI> and the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>They likewise censur'd,</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Cox,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of the <HI>Queen</HI>'s <HI>Bench.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Robert Doyne,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lord Chief Justice of the <HI>Common Pleas.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Thomas Coote,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Richard Nutley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Judges of the <HI>Queen</HI>'s <HI>Bench.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Robert Johnson,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Sir <HI>Henry Eclin,</HI> Barons of the <HI>Exchequer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anthony Upton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Judge of the <HI>Common Pleas.</HI></P>
<P>These Judges were censur'd for signing a Re∣port, in Answer to Doubts stated by the Attor∣ney General in <HI>England,</HI> and confirming the holding over of the Mayors of <HI>Dublin,</HI> as the Custom and Usage of the City; and this with∣out summoning or hearing the Aldermen of the said City: For which they were declared seve∣rally to have acted partially and corruptly; that they are guilty of high Crimes and Misdemean∣ours; and that they should be Impeached for the same.</P>
<P>Then they <HI>Resolved,</HI> that the Twenty Alder∣men, and two Sheriffs, who opposed these ille∣gal Practices, did great Service to the Protestant Interest of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to the Succession of the Crown; and order'd the Thanks of the House to such of them as were then living.</P>
<P>They farther censur'd Judge <HI>Nutley,</HI> for being a principal Manager of that Case, drawing up the Report, signing it, and solliciting a Matter, wherein he was a Judge; in which they decla∣red, he had violated his Oath, prostituted the Character of a Judge, and acted partially and corruptly.</P>
<P>Besides this, they Examin'd into the Case of the Corporation of <HI>Youghall,</HI> a Case too tedious for so short a Work as this: here they charged Sir <HI>Constantine Phipps</HI> with Illegal Practises, but he was out of their reach; and thus having suffici∣ently
<PB N="249" REF="250"/>
shewn as well their Anger as their Power, and having pass'd all the Bills before them, they came to a Close also, the Lords Justices having Prorogued them the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> to the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>August</HI> following.</P>
<P>The Lords Justices Speech on this Occasion, was as follows.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“THOUGH the Sessions has, by many unavoidable Accidents been protracted to an unusual Length, you cannot but think your Time well imployed, having reaped the Advantages of the many good Laws his Ma∣jesty has been pleased to give you; in which Number the <HI>Act for making the Militia more useful,</HI> is a singular Instance of the great Con∣fidence his Majesty Places in the Fidelity and good Affection of his loyal Subjects of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> and will greatly contribute to the Secu∣rity of the Protestant Interest of this King∣dom.”</Q></P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“We are commanded by his Majesty, to re∣turn you Thanks for the Supplies you have so chearfully granted for his Service, and your own Defence; which, we assure you, will be ap∣plied with the utmost Frugality to the Purpo∣ses” for which they were given.</Q></P>

remain a memorable Proof of your unbounded Zeal for his Majesty's Service; and an Obliga∣tion upon us, to continue our best Endeavours” for your Prosperity.</Q></P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P><Q>“The Season of the Year is now far advanced, and it is time you should return to your seve∣ral Countries; where you will take Care, in your respective Stations, to see the Laws duly put in Execution, for the Support of our ex∣cellent Constitution both in Church and State. We shall recommend to you, the Continuance of that Unanimity and Resolution, which have hitherto preserved you in perfect Tranquility, and will best enable you to defeat the futre De∣signs” of your open and secret Enemies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It is a great Pleasure to us, to see this Ses∣sion conclude as it began, with all possible Marks of Loyalty and good Affection to his Majesty; and as we have constantly represented the Merit of so good a People in a just Light, to the best of Princes; so we have his Majesty's Commands, to assure you of his perfect Satis∣faction” in your dutiful Behaviour.</Q></P>
<P>At the End of this Year it was that the Duke of <HI>Argyle</HI> fell under the Royal Displeasure, and was remov'd from all his great Offices and Employments, which were indeed very great ones; for he was at the same time General and Commander in Chief of all his Majesties Forces in <HI>Scotland,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of the Shire of <HI>Dunbarton</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of <HI>Surrey</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Horse, Go∣vernor
<PB N="251" REF="252"/>
of <HI>Port Mahone,</HI> and of the Island of <HI>Mi∣norca,</HI> Knight of the Garter, one of the Privy Council, and first Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince; enjoying besides all these, a Pension of 2000 <HI>l. per Ann,</HI> from the King; of all which, except Knight of the Garter, he was dispossess'd at once; the Reasons and Occasion is not my business to enquire, being not matter of History at this time.</P>
<P>The King was now preparing for his Jour∣ney or Voyage to <HI>Hanover;</HI> in order to which the Bill above-mention'd had been pass'd, and of which his Majesty had made mention in his Speech: Preparatory to this Voyage, a Patent pass'd the Seal, Creating the Prince of Wales <HI>Guardian of the Kingdom, and his Majesties Lieu∣tenant in the same.</HI></P>
<P>It was on the 7th of <HI>July</HI> that the King set forward, and going by Barge to <HI>Gravesend,</HI> his Majesty embark'd there on Board a Yacht, a Squadron of Men of War lying at the <HI>Buoy on the Nore</HI> ready to join; and on the 9th the King Landed in <HI>Holland,</HI> at the <HI>Brill;</HI> from whence he went on Board one of the States Yachts to <HI>Utrecht,</HI> where he took Coach, and arriv'd at <HI>Hanover</HI> the 12th.</P>
<P>As soon as the News of the King's arriving in <HI>Holland</HI> came to Court, the Regent open'd his Commission. One of the first things which oc∣curr'd in this new Administration, was indeed very surprizing for a time, <HI>viz.</HI> that on the 8th, a dead Warrant was sign'd for executing 24 of the State Prisoners, who lay then under Sentence, but had most of them been repriev'd by the King; the Time of their Execution was ap∣pointed for the <HI>Friday</HI> after, when, it seems,
<PB N="252" REF="253"/>
their former Reprieves expir'd; whether it was matter of Form, and that it was necessary to proceed in that manner, or whether it was in order to alarm the Prisoners, who, some said, began to behave as if they were secure, we know not; but the Surprize lasted no longer than the <HI>Thursday</HI> after, when a Reprieve came down for Twenty two of them; the other Two, being Mr. <HI>Paul</HI> the Clergyman, and Mr. <HI>Hall,</HI> for∣merly a Justice of Peace near <HI>Otterburn</HI> in <HI>Nor∣thumberland,</HI> were appointed to be put to Death.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the <HI>13th,</HI> at the usual time, they were brought to the Place of Execution, where, after reading their Papers to the People, they deliver'd them to the Sheriff, and desir'd they might be printed: signifying at the same Time, that they had given out Copies, which if the Sheriff declin'd to Print, the other would nevertheless be made publick: The She∣riff answer'd, he should lay their Request and their Papers also before the Secretaries of State, and Act as he should be directed. After which, they were executed according to their Sentence.</P>
<P>And thus I conclude the Second Year of this brief History.</P>

<HEAD>THE ANNALS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD><HI>Anno</HI> 1717.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS Year the Scene alters, and the Face of Affairs is chang'd; as the last Year's began with Tumults and Riot, Dissaffection, and even Re∣bellion: This begins with Tri∣umph and Satisfaction; the King's Affairs establish themselves upon the Ruin of the Insurrection and Distractions of the last Year, his Arms being every where victorious; and many of the most considerable of the disaffected being fallen into his Hands, His Majesty has more Exercise now for the Sword of his Justice, than the Sword of War, and for his Clemency, than his An∣ger.</P>
<P>Not but that even in this Year there were some Remains seen of the Spirit of Dissatisfaction; the People were conquer'd, who had been in Arms, and the rest were taught by Experience, that
<PB N="2" REF="267"/>
the King was not to be attack'd that way; yet it was impossible so entirely to check the great Dissaf∣fection which had been spread among the People, as that no Remains of it should appear; but this must be added, that whenever any such Excursions were made, it always ended to the Disadvantage of those that were concern'd. I shall give a brief Account of several Attempts to disturb the Peace, which happen'd about this Time; but to enter in∣to a long Detail of the manner how every little Fray of this Sort was began and ended, that I hope will not be expected, except of those volu∣minous Writers, who want Matter to fill up their yearly Labours, which at present is not my Case.</P>
<P>The King, as has been observ'd, at the Conclu∣sion of the last Year was Abroad; the Government was left in the Hands of the Prince, as sole Re∣gent; but acting by the Agency of the old Privy Council: The People had particularly, for some Time past, apply'd themselves on every Rejoicing-Day, <HI>of which we are now pretty full,</HI> to Street-Quarrels, Mobs, Riots and Tumults, in a very un∣accountable Manner, and such as even tended to a new Insurrection.</P>
<P>The first of these had been at <HI>Cambridge</HI> on the 28th of <HI>May</HI> last, which was the King's Birth-Day, and the 29th of <HI>May,</HI> which was the Anniversary of the Restoration; the Case was heard judicially, and both sides were censur'd, as indeed both de∣serv'd; but this gave great Offence to some People, whether it was, that they expected no Body should be allow'd to be tumultuous but themselves, or that they thought the Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> the King's Birth-Day gave them a Loose to be disorderly, that I do not determine; but the Judicature of the Univer∣sity condemn'd the Parties on both sides to be sus∣pended
<PB N="3" REF="268"/>
for a Year, and if they offended a second time, to be expell'd.</P>
<P>This fell hard upon some of the Members of <HI>Clare-Hall,</HI> where Fame says the Fray began, but who it seems thought, that being on the right Side, the Superiors durst not censure them; in which they found themselves mistaken.</P>
<P>But the next Rabble was not so easily suppress'd, nor so cheaply answer'd for; the <HI>Whigs</HI> (in <HI>London</HI> especially) had set up their several Rendezvous, for Rabbling, in Places proper for their Turn, as if they had been a stated Garrison for the City, kept up to preserve the Places, and that these were the several Head Quarters: These they call <HI>Mug-Houses,</HI> Things which however the People might mean well to the Government, and the Government might at first encourage them, or at least wink at them; yet their Method appearing to be, in the very Nature of it, inconsistent with the Publick Peace, and the good Order which every civil Government is ob∣lig'd to maintain, and several Irregularities and Breaches of the Peace having happened, in Con∣sequence of their mistaken Loyalty, to say no more of them; the Government has since thought it con∣venient, not to take it ill that they drop and decay of themselves.</P>
<P>One of these <HI>Mug-Houses</HI> being set up in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>¦ry-Court</HI> in <HI>Fleet-Street,</HI> there was. It <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Publick House before, not far off where the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Party used to assemble; and I will not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that many disorderly Things might be done in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of these Houses, and perhaps more to insult and provoke one another, and yet it might not he with Design to produce the bloody Effects that followed but both will, without Question, shew the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Consequences of any thing done in the way of
<PB N="4" REF="269"/>
Riot and Tumults, let it be for what Cause or Par∣ty it will.</P>
<P>On the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> the Friends of the <HI>Tory-House</HI> assembled in the Street, resenting some Inju∣ry done to the House they used to assemble at for some Days; the <HI>Whig-House</HI> had been Aggressors, but be that as it will, these certainly went beyond their Bounds, threatning and insulting the <HI>Whig-House</HI> the first Day: However, they were beaten off, and so they laid aside their Enterprise for that Night: But came early the next Morning, reinfor∣ced by Detachments from all Parts, <HI>for Rabbling was at this time come to a very great Height.</HI> There were some Scuffles first in the Streets, and the <HI>Tory-House,</HI> of which mention is made, had its Sign broken and defaced, the Windows demolish'd, and the like; but the Rabble increasing, the <HI>Mug-House</HI> People were forced to retreat; in this Part of the Fray, one <HI>Read,</HI> the Master of the <HI>Mug-House,</HI> with a Firelock in his Hand, advancing to the Head of his Men, fir'd, and shot one <HI>Daniel Vaughan,</HI> for∣merly a <HI>Bridewell</HI> Servant, through the Body, of which he fell Dead upon the Spot; but the Rabble, rather enrag'd than dispirited by it, carried on their Attack with the more Fury, and by downright Force enter'd the House, plundered all below Stairs, de∣stroy'd the Drink in the Cellar, and every thing they could break or spoil; but they were repuls'd in their Attempt to force their way up Stairs, by some People who had barricaded the Head of the Stairs, and defended them obstinately. In the mean time, notice being sent to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> a Detachment of the Guards came immediately to the Place, and, tho' not without some Difficulty, the Rabble was disper∣sed; the People separated, and Seven or Eight of them being taken <HI>in the very act</HI> of assaulting the House, were carried to Prison.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="270"/>
As I profess the Office here of a Historian only, I shall not enter into the Reflections on either Side in this Affair, but only relate, that this being an extra∣ordinary Case, and the King being abroad, it made the Government resolve to shew their Resentment in a Severity that might be a Warning and Example to others. Accordingly five Persons taken in this hurly burly, were forthwith brought to Tryal at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> and being all convicted, they were Executed at the Corner or End of the Street where the Fray happen'd.</P>
<P>They were all Youths of ordinary Circumstances, mean, despicable, and would hardly have all suf∣fer'd, but that the unhappy Circumstance of the Time made it necessary: Their Names were as fol∣lows, <HI>(viz.) Thomas Bean, George Purchase, John Love, Richard Price</HI> and <HI>William Price:</HI> There was one <HI>Daniel Delander,</HI> a Watch-maker, Try'd and found Guilty of being a Party in the same Riot, but Mercy interposed, the Publick Justice being sa∣tisfied with the Executions above.</P>
<P>The Rebellion being now at an End, and the prin∣cipal Persons that the Government had their Eyes upon, being Executed, or under Sentence of Death, the Government had little before them for some Time, but to receive the Congratulations of the Subjects in Addresses, which came from all Parts; and the Government in Return exercised some Acts of Clemency, particularly the releasing out of Prison all the Servants who were in Custody, as being Per∣sons supposed to be led into the Snare by the Com∣mands of their Masters, or at least in Consequence of their particular Services, and consequently not altogether so Guilty as their Masters; these were a∣bout forty in number, <HI>(viz.)</HI> eleven out of <HI>Newgate,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="271"/>
twelve out of the <HI>Fleet,</HI> and seventeen out of the <HI>Marshalsea.</HI></P>
<P>With these Acts of Clemency, however, the Ju∣dicial Proceedings went on in their Course, and the most remarkable Tryal was that of Mr. <HI>Pitts</HI> the Keeper of <HI>Newgate,</HI> who was Indicted for <HI>High-Treason,</HI> and Try'd on the same at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> the Charge being for wilfully suffering the Prisoners under his keeping to Escape, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Mr. <HI>Foster, Mac-Intosh,</HI> and others, but after a long Tryal, and a full hearing on all Sides, the Jury brought in their Verdict NOT GUILTY: So he was immediately Discharg'd, and returned to his Post, where he still remains.</P>
<P>Abundance of Printers, Publishers and Hawkers, came under Cognisance, for printing and publishing scandalous Lampoons, Satyrs, Libels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But neither their Names or Crimes are so remarkable, as to require their being nam'd here, except one Mr. <HI>Redmayne,</HI> a Printer, whose Case being very particular, will come to be spoken of again on other Accounts of the like Nature.</P>
<P>It was within a little matter of raising another Tumult, that the Friends of <HI>Tho. Bean,</HI> one of the Five who were thus Executed, had the Imprudence, <HI>to call it no worse,</HI> to make a pompous and popular Funeral for him; having six young Maids to bear up the Pall, with white Scarfs and Favours, and six young Men to lead them. Nor was this all, but the next <HI>Sabbath-Day,</HI> the same Twelve came in Cou∣ples to St. <HI>Bride</HI>'s Church, with their Scarfs and Favours, which drew a great Crowd together, and that had ended in more Disorders, the Mob be∣ginning to reflect upon the Barbarity, as they call'd it, of the Execution: But the Train'd Bands
<PB N="7" REF="272"/>
of the City, a Company whereof were posted in <HI>Salisbury-Court,</HI> fell lustily upon the Rabble, and the young Men and Maids, tho' being with what speed they could gotten as far as <HI>Black Friars</HI> Stairs to take Water, were overtaken by a Party of Sol∣diers sent after them, who apprehended Five of them, but the rest escaped; these were afterwards Tried at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> and being found Guilty, were fin'd 20 <HI>Marks</HI> each, but with an Intimation, that the Court inclined to remit or abate their Fines, if they would acknowledge their Crime, and discover ingeniously who set them on Work; but they all stood out, and lay in <HI>Newgate</HI> till some of their Friends gather'd Money enough for them to pay their Fine.</P>
<P>And now in prosecuting the Prisoners taken in the Rebellion, it came in Course to consider what should be done with those in the North, where the Prisons were full of them, and where none had been yet Try'd, much less Executed, those in <HI>Lancashire</HI> ex∣cepted.</P>
<P>Of the Number I now speak, all the meaner Sort had been Discharg'd, as particularly 353 which were at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and 160 out of the Prisons at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> had been all let go, but the Gentlemen and Leading Men which were in Custody required to be farther consider'd.</P>
<P>After some Time, and several long Debates, it was Resolv'd thus: 1. That the Prisoners in the se∣veral Prisons of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Chester-Castle,</HI> espe∣cially such as had declined Transportation, as seve∣ral of them had, should now be Tried in the ordi∣nary Courts of Justice at the Assizes in <HI>Lancashire;</HI> and as for the Prisoners in <HI>Scotland,</HI> they should be all brought to <HI>Carlisle,</HI> and be Try'd there by a spe∣cial Commission granted for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="273"/>
According to the first Resolution, the Summer Assizes being now at hand, the Prisoners in <HI>Chester-Castle</HI> were carried to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> where several of them were Try'd as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Shuttleworth</HI> of <HI>Alston,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Swarbreck</HI> of <HI>Wesham, Richard Hodgson</HI> of <HI>Walton, William Charnley</HI> of <HI>Walton;</HI> convicted upon Tryal.</P>
<P><HI>John Winkley</HI> of <HI>Alston, Thomas Park</HI> of <HI>Croston, Henry Winkley</HI> of <HI>Alston,</HI> Captain <HI>John Bruce</HI> of <HI>Preston, Laurence Coop</HI> of <HI>Walton;</HI> withdrew their Pleas, and pleaded Guilty.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Walker</HI> of <HI>Forton,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Daniel Dur∣ton. John Wareing</HI> of <HI>Aighton, Richard Singleton</HI> of <HI>Kirkham,</HI> acquitted upon Tryal.</P>
<P><HI>George Coop</HI> and <HI>Richard Abbot</HI> were also clear∣ed by the Jury, though there seem'd plain Proof enough against them</P>
<P><HI>Lawrence Thrope</HI> of <HI>Fishwick, Hugh Barton</HI> of <HI>Claughton, Richard Walmsley</HI> of <HI>Walton,</HI> were ac∣quitted for want of due Proof.</P>
<P><HI>William <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>esketh</HI> of <HI>Maines,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>William Ward</HI> of <HI>Manchester,</HI> Rioter, <HI>Edward Burrow</HI> of <HI>Weeton,</HI> were respited till next Assizes.</P>
<P>By the Temper of the Jury, which appear'd in the Tryal of the first five, the Judges plainly per∣ceiv'd the Case was quite alter'd in that Country, and that this manner of proceeding would not do by any means; and in short, that if the Tryals were to go on, the whole Number would be acquitted, let the Evidence be as it would I say, the Judges seeing this, thought fit to put an End to the Proceedings, and break up the Assizes.</P>
<P>Of the condemn'd Persons, five were Executed the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>October; viz.</HI> three at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and two at <HI>Preston;</HI> their Names were, Captain <HI>Bruce,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="274"/>
<HI>Tho. Shuttleworth, John Winkley, William Charnley,</HI> and <HI>Richard Hodgson.</HI></P>
<P>This Captain <HI>Bruce</HI> was a <HI>Scotsman,</HI> had for∣merly been a Steward or Rent-gatherer to Duke <HI>Ha∣milton,</HI> but was on some private Breach with that Family, turn'd out of the Duke's Business, and liv'd at <HI>Preston;</HI> where, when the Rebels took Possession of that Town, he openly declar'd himself, and took Arms with them.</P>
<P>This Part being over, the rest of the Prisoners were remanded for the present, and most of them lay in Custody till released by the General Pardon, which came out some Months after this.</P>
<P>It comes next in order to mention what was done with the Prisoners in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which in particular occasion'd some warm Debates, some alledging, that they ought not to be removed, but that by the Treaty of Union, which reserved all the <HI>Scots</HI> Judi∣catures entire, they ought to be Try'd in <HI>Scotland:</HI> Likewise some of the Prisoners insisted, and shewed great Reluctance at their being ordered to remove.</P>
<P>However, positive Orders being sent to General <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who then commanded in Chief in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> he gave them Notice to prepare, and tho' in Civility he gave them all the Time he could, and particularly he gave them time to send up their Peti∣tion or Representation to the King and Council, yet upon the Return of the Express, and their Re∣quest not being granted, he was obliged to remove them, and accordingly the <HI>2d</HI> and <HI>3d</HI> of <HI>September</HI> they set forward, with this Exception however, that he suffered some to remain behind, who were Di∣stemper'd and unfit to Travel, as particularly Dr. <HI>Gairns,</HI> Dr. <HI>Carmichael,</HI> and one Mr. <HI>Ogilvy.</HI></P>

<P>The Guards which conducted them were, <HI>Mon∣tague's</HI> Regiment of Foot, and General <HI>Carpenter</HI>'s own Regiment of Dragoons; and thus being on their Journey, we shall leave them for a Time, till we hear of them afterwards in a Judicial Way at
<PB N="14" REF="279"/>
<HI>Carlisle,</HI> whither a Commission of Oyer and Termi∣ner being sent for their Trial, the proper Officers prepar'd to go down thither, to hold a Court of Justice for that Purpose; and abundance of People, as well <HI>Highlanders</HI> as others, were order'd from the <HI>Savoy,</HI> where they had been kept together some Time, to go down to <HI>Carlisle</HI> under a Guard, to give Evidence in the Trials appointed there.</P>
<P>Besides the three sick Gentlemen, there were left behind, the Lord Viscount <HI>Strathallan,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Rollo,</HI> as Peers, and Marquess of <HI>Huntley,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> claim'd to be left behind; but it was referr'd to the Lord Advocate, and other Lawyers, who gave it against him; so he set for∣ward with the rest, but was by an Express from <HI>London,</HI> which met them on the Road, allowed to go back to the Castle, from whence he was some Time after released, by a particular Pardon to him∣self, under the Great Seal.</P>
<P>Some others also prevented their Fate, by break∣ing Prison at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> a few Days before, as par∣ticularly Sir <HI>David Thripland</HI>'s Son, Mr.<HI>—Wilson,</HI> a Mathematician, with two Servants also;<HI>—Bethune</HI> of <HI>Balfour,</HI> Son in-Law to General <HI>Hamilton,—Menzies</HI> of <HI>Pitfodels,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hut∣chins,</HI> Provost of <HI>Aborbrothick.</HI></P>
<P>As the Prisoners arrived at <HI>Carlisle</HI> the 12th of <HI>September,</HI> the Judges appointed to try them ar∣rived there the first of <HI>December</HI> following. An Account of their Proceedings I shall take in its Course.</P>
<P>I come now to another kind of civil War, which employ'd the Pens, as the former had done the Swords of the Parties, and which has indeed run a farther length than a thing of that Nature could have been expected: This civil War began chiefly
<PB N="15" REF="280"/>
among the Ecclesiasticks, tho' it proceeded to em∣bark the Government, and a great many private Per∣sons afterwards in the Quarrel: It consisted of two Parts; tho' I must acknowledge it to be in the main but one and the same Quarrel: The <HI>First</HI> was the Charge of Schism cast upon, or brought against all the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> on Account of their breaking off from the Nonjuring Church, which it was insisted, was the only rightful Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This Contest was began and stated in a clear Draught, in Form of a Constitution, by that very learned Person Doctor <HI>Hicks,</HI> a Person eminent for Learning, exemplar for Life, and saving this par∣ticular Affair, an unexceptionable Man, even among his Enemies.</P>
<P>He had in his Life-time published these Constitu∣tions, and this will bring, <HI>as I said before,</HI> the Story of Mr. <HI>Redmayne,</HI> the Printer, on the Stage again, for one Mr. <HI>Howell,</HI> a Clergyman, and also a Non∣juror, had written a Book, Entituled, <HI>The Case of Schism in the Church of England considered;</HI> he had not only written, but had printed it at Mr. <HI>Redmayne</HI>'s Printing-House, in <HI>Jewen-Street;</HI> where the Govern∣ment having Information of it, some of them were seized: The Messenger having likewise a Warrant to apprehend Mr. <HI>Howell,</HI> he was also taken up, and his Papers seized.</P>
<P>Among his Papers were also found his Letters of Ordination, being an Original Instrument; by which it appears, that he received Priest's Orders, with Institution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at the Hands of the late Dr.<HI>Hicks;</HI> who, as appears by those Instruments, stiled himself Suffragan Bishop of <HI>Thetford.</HI> There was also a Form of Absolution, and Reception of
<PB N="16" REF="281"/>
Converts and Penitents, returning from the sup∣posed Schism, as on their being receiv'd into the Nonjurors Church.</P>
<P>But while the Town was amused with this bold Attempt of Mr. <HI>Howell's,</HI> one of the King's Mes∣sengers being in quest of some other Pamphlet, and searching the House of the said Mr. <HI>Redmayne</HI> the Printer, in <HI>Jewin-Street,</HI> happen'd upon another thing of ten Thousand times the Consequence of this of Mr. <HI>Howell</HI>'s, and of which Mr. <HI>Howell</HI> seem'd to be only a Deducter or Abridger. This was the Book containing <HI>the Constitution</HI> mentioned above, and said to be written by the said Dr. <HI>Hicks.</HI> The Messenger found but one Copy, the rest of the Impression being conveyed away before he came; however, this one Book was sufficient to discover to the Government that such a Thing was on Foot, and had been published; and was sufficient also to bring the Printer upon the Stage, in order to a far∣ther Enquiry into the Particulars: The Book is en∣tituled, <HI>The Constitution of the Catholick Church, and the Nature and Consequences of Schism, set forth in a Collection of Papers written by the R. Re∣verend</HI> George Hicks, <HI>D. D.</HI></P>
<P>The Contents of these Books are too long to be brought into a Collection of Facts; and as these make no Part of History, I refer the Reader to the Books themselves: But as to the Ordination of Mr. <HI>Howell,</HI> by the said Dr. <HI>Hicks,</HI> it is so far Mar∣ter of History, and cannot be omitted, as what may also be of use on other Occasions.</P>
<P>The Letters of Ordination, as produced in Court, upon his Trial both in Latin and English, are as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Sealed on a Label with hard red Wax, the Seal representing a Shepherd with a Sheep upon his Shoulders, and a Crook in his Hand, with this Mot∣to, <HI>The good Shepherd.</HI></P>
<P>There were several other Papers taken at the same Time, and several other Things contained in these; as in particular, a Form or Office for Absolution of a Penitent, as they call'd them, or one returning <HI>from the Scism,</HI> that is to say, <HI>from</HI> the Church of <HI>England</HI> Establisht, <HI>to</HI> the Jacobite Church; which Office they add to the Liturgy of the Church.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Government thought it abso∣lutely necessary to prosecute these Things with Se∣verity, and accordingly Mr. <HI>Howell</HI> was Tried for his Part at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> where, after a tedious Hearing on all sides, (indeed he did not insist much on his not being the Author, neither did he decline the Principles of <HI>Jacobitism</HI> mention'd in his Book, tho' that was no Argument to his Conviction,) <HI>he was found Guilty,</HI> and his Sentence, which however, has not been yet fully executed, was as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="284"/>
To be twice Whipp'd, to pay 500 <HI>l.</HI> Fine to the King, to lie three Years in Prison without Bail, and to find two Sureties in 400 <HI>l.</HI> each, and him∣self to be Bound in 1000 <HI>l.</HI> to be of the good Beha∣viour during Life. The Sentence being pass'd, the Hangman was order'd to take his Gown off as he stood at the Bar, <HI>which was done accordingly.</HI></P>
<P>Thus ended this Church Dispute, for the Sen∣tence against Mr. <HI>Howell</HI> was such as answered the End of such Sentences, <HI>viz.</HI> it deferred any one else from meddling with it any more; as for the Princer Mr. <HI>Redmayne,</HI> he was afterwards brought to his Tryal also, and was fined 500 <HI>l.</HI> five Years Impri∣sonment, and they both continue close Prisoners to this Day.</P>
<P>During this Church Controversie, which we shall find renew'd quickly in another, equally tending to Confusion and Distraction in Things religious; I say, during this, the publick Justice went on, pur∣suing the Remains of the Rebellion, in order, had it been possible, to root out the very Seeds of Disaf∣fection from among the People.</P>
<P>During this, I say, publick Justice proceeded, and three Particulars presented; the first was, that a Visitation, by Commission was made of the Universities in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> but particularly at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> where, upon the Landing of the Pretender, several of the Clergy, Members of the Colleges there, had too unwarily discover'd their Principles, and appear'd in the In∣terest; these were severally called before the Com∣missioners, and Witnesses examin'd against those that appear'd: Several of them, to prevent their be∣ing expell'd, voluntarily demitted, and expelled themselves, some were fled into <HI>Prince,</HI> and those that did appear, having <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en examin'd, and what
<PB N="20" REF="285"/>
they alledg'd, being mark'd down, the Commis∣sioners gave no Sentence at that Time, but ad∣journ'd to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where meeting afterwards, the Persons were all expell'd the College.</P>
<P>The second Head of Justice, in these Cases, relates to the Commissioners appointed by Parliament, to enquire into the Estates of the Delinquents: These having separated themselves, part for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and part for <HI>England,</HI> according to the Act of Parlia∣ment, began about this Time to put the Law in Execution, and several Estates were enter'd upon, as well in <HI>England</HI> as in <HI>Scotland;</HI> as also several Parcels of Plate, of Jewels, and of Lands, said to be given to superstitious Uses; the Particular of all which, and of their farther Proceedings, will be seen together, when they come to make their Re∣port to the Parliament, from whom they receiv'd their Power.</P>
<P>But I come back to the Proceedings at <HI>Carlisle,</HI> which were the most considerable, and on which the Eyes of all the World were turn'd at that Time, a Summary of which take as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> The Judges being arriv'd, as I observ'd, the 1st of <HI>De∣cember,</HI> and all Things made ready for constituting a Court of Justice, they met on the 7th, and having read their Commission, the Grand Jury were called, and the Judges gave them the Sum of the Business they were to do, in the Form of a Charge as usual; after which, Bills of Indictment were pre∣sented to them against the several Prisoners respe∣ctively, who, when the Grand Jury had found the said Bills, were brought to the Bar, and the Clerk of the Crown read a Form to them, signifying that Bills were found against them for High-Treason, in Levying War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That the Law allow'd Coun∣cil to plead for them, and a Copy of their In∣dictment
<PB N="21" REF="286"/>
to be given them; and five Days Notice of their Tryals if they desired it, and thereupon another Clerk delivered them Copies of their seve∣ral Indictments accordingly, and they desiring the Time mention'd, the Court allow'd them seven Days, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to the <HI>15th,</HI> and gave them Notice of Tryal accordingly.</P>
<Q><P>The Prisoners brought up the first Day were,</P>
<P>Colonel <HI>John Balfour,</HI> Major <HI>Henry Balfour, Pat. Auchmoutye, John Ratroy,</HI> Sir <HI>Tho. Calder, John Ro∣binson, Arch. Fotheringham</HI> of <HI>Powrie, Charles Gar∣den, Alexander Hay, Robert Rollo, Patrick Seaton; George Maul,</HI> Steward to the Earl of <HI>Panmure,</HI> was Discharg'd, the Jury having return'd the Bill against him <HI>(Ignoramus.)</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>On the <HI>10th,</HI> the following Prisoners were brought in the same manner.</P>
<P><HI>James Carnegie</HI> of <HI>Ballmoon, Tho. Tulloch, Alex. Forbes, Waltar Graham, John Ross, John Gordon, William Hay, Tho. Drummond, James Carnegie</HI> of <HI>Finhaven, Robert Murray,</HI> Col. <HI>James Urquhart, John Carstairs,</HI> Dr. <HI>Scot,</HI> Mr. <HI>Trotter,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ruther∣ford,</HI> Mr. <HI>Carr.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>11th, William Murray</HI> of <HI>Auchertyre, John Lyndsay, Pat. Gordon, Sylvester Douglass.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>12th, John Robertson,</HI> Dr. <HI>John Kinloch, James Carnegie,</HI> Surgeon, <HI>John Hamilton, George Taylor, James Rollo,</HI> Son to <HI>Rob. Rollo.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>13th, Patrick Robertson, John Stewart</HI> of <HI>Ross, John Stewart</HI> Junior, of <HI>Glenbucket.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>15th, Alex. Mackenzie</HI> of <HI>Frazerdale.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>17th,</HI> Brigadier <HI>Campbell.</HI></P></Q>
<P><PB N="22" REF="287"/>
Besides these, the Two following were Discharg'd, the Bills against them being return'd <HI>(Ignoramus.) James Burnet</HI> of <HI>Monbeddo,</HI> and <HI>James Spence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alexander Carnegie</HI> was indicted by the Name of <HI>James,</HI> and had some Advantage by it; but as it might in the main be some Obstruction to the Mercy he resolv'd to hope for, he gave notice of it himself, and the Bill was given back to the Grand-Jury, and found a second Time.</P>
<P>On the <HI>10th,</HI> when the second Twelve were brought to the Bar, Mr. <HI>Charles Garden,</HI> one of the first Twelve, broke the Way, and moving the Court that he might be brought to the Bar and Ar∣rain'd, pleaded Guilty, and threw himself upon Mercy.</P>
<P>On the <HI>11th,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Murray</HI> of <HI>Auchter∣tyre,</HI> and Mr. <HI>James Carnegie</HI> of <HI>Tinhavin.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>12th, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otheringham</HI> of <HI>Powrie,</HI> Colonel <HI>James Ʋ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hart,</HI> and <HI>Alezander Hay.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>13th,</HI> Sir <HI>The Calder.</HI> All did the like.</P>
<P>On the <HI>15th,</HI> the Court sat again, when instead of their taking Tryals as was appointed, more of the Prisoners pleaded Guilty, as the Six had done before, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Colonel <HI>John B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur,</HI> Major <HI>Henry Balfour, Pat. Auchmoutie, John Rattray, Robert Rollo</HI> of <HI>Powhouse, Pat. Seaton, John Ross, John Gordon, Robert Murray, Alexander Carnegie.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>17th,</HI> Mr. <HI>Carstairs, Alexander Mac∣kenzie</HI> of <HI>Frazerdale, James Carnegie,</HI> Surgeon, <HI>James Rollo,</HI> Son of <HI>Rob. Rollo</HI> of <HI>Powhouse, Alex∣ander Forbes, Waltar Graham, Tho. Drummond,</HI> All pleaded Guilty.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="288"/>
On the <HI>19th,</HI> Mr.<HI>—Hay,</HI> who had demurr'd, and pleaded by Council to the Jurisdiction of the Court, finding his Plea was over-ruled, pleaded Guilty. As did also, <HI>John Robertson,</HI> who was set by as a Lunatick, Dr. <HI>John Kinlock, John Hamilton, George Taylor.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>20th, Pat. Gordon, Pat. Robertson.</HI></P>
<P>All these having pleaded Guilty, there remain'd of all the Prisoners from <HI>Scotland</HI> that they had Evidence against, only Four to be Try'd, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Brigadier <HI>Campbell</HI> of <HI>Ormondell,</HI> Mr. <HI>Tulloch, Stewart</HI> of <HI>Ross, Stewart</HI> of <HI>Glenbucket.</HI></P>
<P>Of these Four last mention'd Prisoners, the Ac∣count is very particular, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The two <HI>Stewarts</HI> gave such Accounts of them∣selves, and the Court receiv'd such Satisfaction in that Account, that the Sollicitor-General thought fit to acquaint the Court that it would be for his Majesty's Service, to allow a Writ of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li Prose∣qui</HI> to be enter'd in their behalf, which was ordered accordingly, yet without mentioning any thing in publick of the Reasons which procur'd them so much Favour.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Tulloch</HI> resolv'd to stand it, and took his Tryal the <HI>26th,</HI> tho' the King's Council examin'd no less than seven Witnesses against him, who all testified his being in the Earl of <HI>Marr</HI>'s Army, and named Time and Place to the several Actions in which he had appeared, and agreed very well in their Evidence, so that all that heard it, believed he would be found Guilty, and cast himself upon Mer∣cy, as others had done: But Mr. <HI>Tulloch</HI> went upon a quite differing Foot in his Defence, and not contending the Fact, or whether it was true or no that he was in Arms, or in the Army aforesaid;

his Council insisted, that he was not there in the Sense of the Indictment; that he was there indeed as a Prisoner, or as a Man not in his own Power; but that he was not <HI>sui juris,</HI> but was taken by Force by the Troops of the Marquis of <HI>Huntley,</HI> and carried along with them against his Will, which the Council alledged was not Rebellion with∣in the Words of the Indictment; that the Adverbs of the Indictment would not hold, for that it was not <HI>Trayterously, Seditiously,</HI> and <HI>Advisedly;</HI> but Unwillingly, Compulsively, and Forcibly; against his Intention, Resolution, and Design; the Witnes∣ses which he produced, proved that he was thus forcibly taken, and brought away from his own House; that he entreated them not to carry him a∣way, being ancient and infirm, I unfit for the Ser∣vice or for the Hardship of the Field; that he pro∣test<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> against the Violence they used with him, and that he had declared, he would not serve them any otherwise than by For<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></P>

<P>The next who was to take Trial, was Colonel <HI>Campbell of Ormendell,</HI> commonly call'd Brigadier <HI>Campbell;</HI> he was an old Soldier, and had been Twenty Years in the Service of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Musco∣vy,</HI> where he had attain'd from a private Gentle∣man, to be a Brigedier of Foot, and Colonel of a Regiment of 2000 Men; he quitted that Service upon the News of the Affair in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and no
<PB N="25" REF="290"/>
doubt, having a different Account of the Circum∣stances of Things than he found true; for having got Shipping in the <HI>Sound,</HI> and landed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he found the <HI>Pretender</HI> return'd to <HI>France,</HI> the Ar∣my dispers'd, and the Rebels on all Hands shifting for their Lives: However he got into the Isle of <HI>Skey,</HI> to the Interest of the <HI>Mac Donalds,</HI> and was at the Head of 1500 Men when the Troops sent thither to attack them, arriv'd there: After this he did his Part as a Soldier, tho' in a lost Cause, and encouraged the Men all he could. When the Troops appear'd, his Men all fled, but he being a Man not used to turn his Back, stood stock still with his Arms in his Hands, till an Officer came up to him, who offering him Quarter, he presented him his Sword, and was taken.</P>
<P>There was no Possibility of his making any De∣fence against all these Circumstances of Guilt, yet, whether it was that he expected no Mercy, or that he resolv'd to seek not we know not, he pleaded not Guilty: But when the Time for his Trial was come, and the Officers were sent to his Chamber to fetch him to the Bar, they found no∣thing in his Room but his Hat and Perriwig, for he had, it seems, found Means to escape out of the Castle, and has not been since heard of.</P>
<P>Things standing thus, and the Court being in∣form'd of it, and that there were no more Procee∣dings before them, the Petty-Jury were discharg'd, as the Grand-Jury had been some Days before, and then they proceeded to pass Sentence.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Prisoners who had pleaded Guil∣ty, were call'd up the same Day, and Sentence was pass'd upon them as is usual in Cases of Treason.</P>

<P>All Proceedings being thus at an End, the Com∣mission was also closed by the Judges, and the Court was dismissed, and three Days after the Judges came away, leaving however, no Order for the Executi∣on of any of the Persons Condemn'd, most of them being reserv'd to his Majesty's Mercy; so that it now appeared it was no ill Turn for them, that they were brought to <HI>England</HI> to be try'd.</P>
<P>At this Period I think I may put an End to all Things relating to the Rebellion, there being no more Executions on one hand, or Opposition on the other after this, except a Serjeant who was Try'd by a Council of War at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for the miscar∣ry'd Attempt of betraying the Castle, he was found Guilty, and accordingly hang'd over the Castle Wall at a prodigious Height from the Ground, where
<PB N="28" REF="293"/>
he was left hanging also for some Days, till a Storm of Wind happening to break the Rope, he fell down the Precipice, and was so broken with the Fall, that they could not hang him up again.</P>
<P>As the rest of the Prisoners at <HI>Carlisle</HI> against whom no Evidence appe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d, were discharg'd, so Twenty-three more, most of them <HI>Scots,</HI> were on the same Foot discharg'd out of the Prisons at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> so that now there remain'd only two Prisoners in <HI>Newgate</HI> on that Account, and none at all in the <HI>Marshalsea.</HI></P>
<P>The hurry of Business being thus over for a while, and these Things being transacted at a great Distance from Court, the Regent took a Tour into the Coun∣try; the Occasion of this short Progress was no o∣ther as I could ever learn, but a meer Turn for Di∣version, and to take a little Air, and the short Stay the Prince made, confirms that Opinion, for he went out on the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> din'd at <HI>Knowl</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI>'s Seat, and lay that Night at the Duke of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s House, near <HI>Lewes</HI> in <HI>Sussex:</HI> His Royal Highness diverted him∣self as he went, by making a short Stay at <HI>Tun∣bridge,</HI> to see the Wells and the Walks, and diver∣ted the People there also very much: The next Day he went thro' <HI>Chichester</HI> to <HI>Stansted,</HI> the Seat of the Earl of <HI>Scarborough,</HI> where he lay that Night: The <HI>26th</HI> he went to see the Fortifications at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and returned the same Night to <HI>Stansted;</HI> and the <HI>27th,</HI> returned to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Court.</HI></P>
<P>All Things were may in a State of Tranquillity, and seem'd to promise a Continuance, but an un∣foreseen Accident gave some Disturbance to it, and this was the Tumult at <HI>Oxford,</HI> an Affair which made great Noise at first, and was afterwards brought before, both the Council and the Parliament, where
<PB N="29" REF="294"/>
tho' the <HI>Oxonians</HI> receiv'd some Checks, yet no Ju∣dicial Proceedings were ever had against the Towns∣men or Scholars, as was threaten'd, the Soldiers ha∣ving too much to be called in question for, to desire the Cause to be heard any where but where it was.</P>
<P>The Business was, in short, that the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>Octo∣ber</HI> being the Prince's Birth Day, and a Regiment of Soldiers, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Regiment of Foot of <HI>Dubour∣gay</HI> being quarter'd in the Town, the Major of the Regiment resolving to celebrate the Day, and find∣ing the Inhabitants inclined to take but little Notice of it, some Bickerings happen'd between the Major and the Townsmen, about Ringing the Bells and such Things, afterwards they fell to throwing Stones on both Sides, breaking of Windows, and some Heads in the Quarrel, and it was said, the Mayor and Aldermen received some of the Knocks.</P>
<P>However it was the Magistrates made the first Complaint, and drew up a great many Affidavits of the Fact, and Mr. <HI>Rowney</HI> their Representative, wrote a Letter to Mr. Secretary <HI>Methuen</HI> about it, as did also the Vice-Chancellor of the University and the Mayor of the City, to my Lord <HI>Townshend:</HI> On the other hand, Major <HI>Offranville,</HI> the Major of the Regiment wrote likewise to the Lord <HI>Townshend,</HI> and the Soldiers drew up Affidavits also to every Particular; at length it came to be heard before the Council, who after some Debates, Resolved it in Favour of the Soldiers, which Resolve being after∣wards heard in the House of Lords, was confirm'd there Word for Word, as I shall note in its Place: The Report of the Committee of Council was as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<PB N="30" REF="295"/>
<P>Cockpit, <HI>December</HI> 31. 1716.</P>
<Q><P><HI>THE Depositions on the Part of the Complainants relating to the Disturbances that happened at</HI> Oxford <HI>on the Prince's Birth-Day, and the Deposi∣tions on the Part of the Officers and Soldiers, and others concerned with them, having all been read, the Lords of the Committee are of Opinion, That the Heads of the Ʋniversity, and Mayor of the City, neglected to make any publick Rejoicings on the Prince's Birth-Day: But some of the Collegiates, with the Officers, being met to celebrate the said Day, the House where they were, was assaulted, and the Win∣dows were broken by the Rabble, which was the Be∣ginning and Occasion of the Riots that ensued, as well from the Soldiers as the Scholars and Townsmen, and that the Conduct of the Major seems well justified by the Affidavits produced on his Part.</HI></P></Q>
<P>When these Things came to be heard before the House of Lords, their Lordships came to the like Resolution, <HI>(viz.)</HI> First they voted, <HI>That the Lords of the Committee of Council had sufficient Grounds to come to the Resolution they did come to,</HI> as above; and then they took into Consideration the Printing the Depositions, upon which they Resolv'd secondly, <HI>That the Printing and Publishing the Depositions upon which the Complaints relating to the Riots at</HI> Oxford <HI>were founded, while that Matter was under the Exa∣mination of the Lords of the Committee of Council, and before they had Time to come to any Resoluti∣on touching the same, was Irregular, Disrespectful to his Royal Highness the Prince, and tending to Sedition.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="296"/>
Tumults indeed took up a great Part of the first Month of this Year, for there was something so uneasy and dissatisfy'd in the People's Temper at that Time, that they made almost every thing an Occasion of Riot and Disorder: The Occasion how∣ever of this I am going to relate, did not begin up∣on any Matters of State or Politicks, which verifies what I have just now said of the tumultuous Dispo∣sition of the People.</P>
<P>There is a Fair for Cattle held at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> call'd <HI>Hallow-Fair,</HI> or in <HI>English</HI> the Fair of <HI>Alhallows,</HI> or of <HI>All-Saints,</HI> a Soldier in this Fair, having some Dirt thrown upon him by a Cow running hastily by him, draws his Sword up∣on a <HI>Scots</HI> Highlander who was driving the Cow, and wounded the poor Fellow in the Arm; upon this other Highlanders came in, and seeing the poor Man hurt, fell upon the Soldier; the Soldier de∣fended himself a while, but seeing his Danger, made off, the Rabble following him to the General's Quar∣ters, where there was a Guard, and where the Mob demanded him, and one of them pressing in violently upon the Centinel, he fir'd and kill'd him; but this encreasing the Tumult, the Rabble had cer∣tainly storm'd the General's House and perhaps done more Mischief, if General <HI>Carpenter</HI> had not come timely in with a strong Party, and even then the Mob would not have been pacify'd, if the General by his very obliging and civil Treatment had not prevail'd more, than his Men did or could have done by their Fire-Arms and Swords.</P>
<P>The <HI>9th</HI> of this Month, the Princess was delive∣red of a dead Child, and was not only very ill in her Travail, but in great Danger for two or three Days, after having been taken with Faintings and
<PB N="32" REF="297"/>
Swoonings two or three Times, but it went off a∣gain, and in a Week she was out of Danger.</P>
<P>The Season advancing, and Winter coming on, the King, who had been now above four Months abroad, began to look homeward; and as his Affairs seem'd to draw to a close, the Squadron appointed to Convoy him over, with the Yatchts for his Re∣tinue, were order'd over to <HI>Holland,</HI> and the Par∣liament which stood prorogu'd to the <HI>20th,</HI> now were order'd to be farther prorogu'd to the <HI>8th</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> by which Time it was expected the King would have finished all his Business and be arriv'd.</P>
<P>This mentioning his Majesty's Affairs Abroad, car∣ries me naturally to enquire into the Particulars of them as far as they are proper to this History, and first passing over his Majesty's Houshold Business A∣broad, or as it Relates to the Government of his Hereditary Dominions; I say, passing these, the Affairs the King had there which Respected <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Great-Britain</HI> were principally two: (viz.) <HI>1st</HI> Con∣cerning himself in the Affair of <HI>Sweden;</HI> to which purpose a Squadron had been sent to the <HI>Baltick,</HI> which now receiv'd it's Orders immediately from the King in Person; and <HI>2dly,</HI> Negotiating a defensive Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> of which it is needfull to make some mention, because an Alliance with <HI>France</HI> was really a new Thing in the World, and People began to wonder what the meaning of it might be, expecting that by the Novelty of it some thing particular was intended, it is true that the Circumstances were very particular on both sides, and it is not easy to say by whom it was most wanted or most desired, either <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or <HI>France:</HI> It is confess'd <HI>France</HI> sought it, perhaps their Necessity at that time prompted them; but it is as true that the Councils of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> came very willingly into it, and
<PB N="33" REF="298"/>
that on the account of Interest also, as well as <HI>France,</HI> this is not ill stated by one, who a cer∣tain Writer need not be asham'd to own he took it from, and who I follow in this Case, tho' with more Honesty, because I acknowledge it: He ex∣presses it thus: The Duke Regent, <HI>says he,</HI> a Man of Prudence and Penetration, saw not only his own Safety absolutely depending upon it, in Case of the Demise of the present King; but happily for him, found his Neighbours had some certain nice Articles, which it was in his <HI>Power</HI> to yield them at that time, and which would infallibly render the Propo∣sal acceptable to them. For example, he could not but know, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> and his Friends, who were all in his Power, would be a Sacrifice highly agreeable to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and necessa∣ry to the Peace of his Subjects; that the Affair of <HI>Mardyke</HI> would be a Pledge of too great a Value not to be earnestly desired by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and would be a singular Ease to the Merchants of such a Trading Country; he knew that when he offered two such Points, the Court of <HI>Britain</HI> were too penetrating not to listen to it, and if possible secure them upon any reasonable Terms.</P>
<P>He knew the <HI>Dutch,</HI> a Nation desirous of Peace upon just Terms, and depending wholly upon Trade, would be very glad of a Concession which <HI>France</HI> had in its Power to give, <HI>viz.</HI> the Tariff of <HI>Sixty Four;</HI> and finding it of the last Importance to him∣self to secure the Amity of these two powerful Neighbours, he resolved to deny nothing they could reasonably demand, in order to enter into new Engagements with them both; that if at any time he should come to have his Claim to the Crown of <HI>France</HI> disputed by the House of <HI>Spain,</HI> he might not
<PB N="34" REF="299"/>
only be secure behind him, but also be powerfully Supported.</P>
<P>Upon these Considerations, he made no scruple to agree to expunge the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and all his Ad∣herents, entirely out of the Dominions of <HI>France;</HI> nay, even to oblige him to remove from <HI>Avignon,</HI> tho' it was a Place entirely in the Jurisdiction, and under the Sovereignty of the Pope. He made no scruple of Engaging to give no Sanctuary in the Dominions of <HI>France,</HI> to any of King <HI>George</HI>'s Re∣bels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he made no difficulty effectually to demolish and destroy the new Canal of <HI>Mardyke,</HI> and all the Works there or at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> which should be capable of making either of those Places Defen∣sible, or fit for receiving Ships of Burthen. Besides this, he made no difficulty of granting to the <HI>Dutch</HI> all they had to desire in their Commerce, and to give them a free Trade into <HI>France</HI> upon such Terms as they had formerly enjoy'd.</P>
<P>These Concessions made the Proposals of <HI>France</HI> relish very well both at <HI>London,</HI> and at the <HI>Hague;</HI> and it appears since, that the King took his Mea∣sures very right in accepting the Project of the Trea∣ty of Alliance, since he saw the Regent under per∣haps a greater Necessity of it, than even if he had been reduced by a War, and that now was the Time, not only to obtain of the <HI>French</HI> all that could be asked, but even to bring the <HI>French</HI> Court to be dependent upon the <HI>British,</HI> and always at∣tach'd to the <HI>British</HI> Interest, by the undissembling Tie, of a regard to their own.</P>
<P>These were some of the Motives to this Alliance on both sides; in which it was to be observ'd, the <HI>French</HI> proceeded with more Candour and Openness than usually was the Practice of that wily Nation.
<PB N="35" REF="300"/>
His <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty, though he found the Inte∣rest of his Kingdoms very visibly form'd in the Treaty, yet wisely suffered himself to be assiduously Courted to it, and gave the <HI>French</HI> Occasion to let the World know, it was their Motion, and at their Desire; which reserve in the Conduct of the Trea∣ty, gave his Majesty opportunity in many Cases to insist with Advantage on several Things, which per∣haps the <HI>French</HI> would otherwise with more difficul∣ty have given up, as the Manner and Circumstances of the Demolishing <HI>Mardyke,</HI> the Dimensions to which the Sluices were to be reduced, the sending o∣ver <HI>British</HI> Commissioners to inspect the Performance, and the like; also, as to the Entertaining of Fugi∣tives, the removing of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and his De∣pendents, and such other Cases as were the most Es∣sential on the King's side.</P>
<P>Also, this distinguish'd Conduct on his Majesty's Side, put a Stop to all seeming Dissatisfactions that might affect the People on occasion of this Treaty. An Alliance with <HI>France</HI> was a new thing to be talk'd of in these Kingdoms; it had so often been entered upon in a scandalous Manner, and with an ill De∣sign, that it was something difficult to reconcile the People so much as to the very thing in general; but when it was answered, that the King, who it was suppos'd, always acted in such Cases with his Eyes open, and was not to be imposed upon by the Arts of the <HI>French</HI> Court, or to be deceived by their u∣sual Cunning; I say, when the Nation came to con∣sider, that the King himself was at the Head of the Treaty, and that he was upon the Spor, all that Jealousie, which began to infuse its self into the Minds of the People in general, vanished of a sudden, and they entirely depended upon it, that if the King engag'd in such a Treaty, he would
<PB N="36" REF="301"/>
bring it to answer the Desires and Interests of his People, or not conclude it at all.</P>
<P>Nor has the Event deceiv'd their Expectation, every Article of the Treaty which relates to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> being visibly calculated for her Interest and Advantage.</P>
<P>Thus the Treaty went on with Success, it was ma∣nag'd at the <HI>Hague</HI> by the Marquis <HI>Chateauneuf,</HI> and the Abbor <HI>Du Bois</HI> on the <HI>French</HI> Part; by the Lord <HI>Cadogan,</HI> and the ordinary <HI>British</HI> Resident on his Ma∣jesty's Part, the King himself being at Hand to give Instructions on any Emergency, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Hanover;</HI> and by the Pensionary <HI>Hyensius</HI> chiefly, on the Part of the <HI>States,</HI> and about the middle of <HI>January</HI> was concluded and finished.</P>
<P>There was besides these Things of Weight, one Business of lesser Importance which was requisite to be manag'd at <HI>Hanover</HI> only, this was the vesting the young Prince Royal, the King's Grandson, with the Order of the Garter, as also his Majesty's Bro∣ther Prince <HI>Ernest,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Osnaburgh,</HI> and Duke of <HI>York,</HI> which was done with all the usual Cere∣monies, the King himself putting on the blew Rib∣band on his Brother, as also on the young Prince, in his own Closet; as to their Installment, it was not till many Months after, as shall be mention'd in its Place.</P>
<P>I omit smalier Matters here, which might perhaps take up some few Days between the Preparations for the King's coming over and his arriving; the main and more considerable Things which happen'd at this Time, drawing me off from Things of lesser Moment.</P>
<P>Breaches and Contention between the Parties were no Novelty, and History would be even clogg'd in the Repetition of them; but that the Whigs
<PB N="37" REF="302"/>
should fall out among themselves, and that when the Game was all in their own Hands too, when they had their Enemies all under their Feet, when nothing could oppose or withstand them, this is what no History can equal, no Historian could expect, and can hardly be supposed to spring from any Founda∣tion but this, that something must be in hand to do, which the <HI>Resigners,</HI> for so they were call'd, cared not to have any hand in, or something proposed to them to be done, which they cared not to comply with.</P>
<P>Two Things indeed were in Agitation at that Time, which, it was expected by many, would have been brought into Parliament in the ensuing Session, and which some have said were entirely broken off and defeated by the demitting of those Men, with∣out whose Interest, the Persons concern'd did not think themselves sufficient for the Undertaking: These two Things were as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The taking off the Acts of Parliament which severally disabled the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> from enjoying any Employment or Office of Trust in the Government, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">II. The repealing that Part of the Act for Secu∣rity of the Succession, made in the <HI>Sixth</HI> of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> Prohibiting Foreigners, tho' Na∣turalized, to be capable of Sitting in the House of Lords.</P>
<P>The last of these seem'd to respect the enobling some Foreigners, who, it seems, had their Eyes, or their Friends for them, upon the Project of introducing them into the <HI>British</HI> Peetage, and a Pamphlet was written by one <HI>Toland,</HI> a Pro∣fligate of the Party, to prepare the Minds of the People, and perhaps of the Parliament for such a Thing; but this Pamphlet rather alarm'd the Peers,
<PB N="38" REF="303"/>
than influenc'd them in Favour of the Design, and the Thing was so exposed and ridicul'd by other Pamphiets, that the Contrivers were easily convinc'd of the Impracticableness of the Thing, and laid down the Design.</P>
<P>As for the Sentiments of the great Men at Court, they were no less divided upon this Article than up∣on others, and as one Division generally introduces another, a strange Distrust, Uneasiness, and at last Dissati faction seem'd to spread itself among even the Ministry it self, so that the Clashings at length appear'd to be obstructing to the publick Business, and the King was in a few Words, obliged to take it into his own Hands.</P>
<P>Here began the Changes which follow'd, and as his Majesty found it convenient to change some Hands in the Administration, so some others believing they should not have the same Freedom in acting, which they had before, tho' necessary to the Ser∣vice, chose rather to demit, than serve with those who they had no Confidence in, and perhaps expe∣cted no Assistance from.</P>
<P>The first who was remov'd, was the Lord Viscount <HI>Townshend,</HI> Secretary of State; the King being yet at <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nover,</HI> sent his Lordship's Dismiss from thence on the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>The Whiggs were Thunder-struck at this Blow, and receiv'd the News with the greatest Astonish∣ment and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ernation: But tho' the Lord <HI>Town∣shend</HI> was dismiss'd from the Office of Secretary, yet he seem'd for some time to keep his Interest in his Prince's Favour, seeing it was immediately re∣solv'd to make him Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Room of the Duke of <HI>Grafton,</HI> and Lord <HI>Gall∣way,</HI> who were about that time dismiss'd; and tho' this was not immediately done, and we were told
<PB N="39" REF="304"/>
for a while, that his Lordship declin'd that Post, yet soon after the King's Arrival it was fix'd, and my Lord <HI>Townshend</HI> was accordingly appointed Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and entred upon the said Office, tho' that good Disposition of Things did not continue neither but for a little while, as we shall see presently.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this Remove was not attended for the present with any others as Consequences of it. There were indeed some other Changes in Court Offices, <HI>which it is meet to mention here.</HI> But the great Change which was made on Party-Account was not yet for some time, and is therefore referr'd to its proper Place. The immediate Changes were these, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Roxburgh</HI> was appointed Secretary of State, not, <HI>properly speaking,</HI> in the Room of the Lord <HI>Townshend,</HI> but rather in the Vacancy which had remain'd ever since the Duke of <HI>Mon∣tress</HI> laid down, as is mention'd in our last Year.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> Lord Privy-Seal, demit∣ted that Employment, and was made Vice Treasurer of <HI>Ireland</HI> for Life; an Employ of great Advantage; but as it was officiated by Officers under his Lord∣ship, we shall soon find him filling up a higher Sta∣tion on this side the Seas.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Montross</HI> was made Lord Privy-Seal in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Room of the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Kingston,</HI> Lord Privy-Seal in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> in the room of the Earl of <HI>Sunderland.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Polwarth,</HI> eldest Son to the Earl of <HI>Marchmont,</HI> and Ambassador at the Court of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> was made Lord Clerk Register in <HI>Scotland,</HI> formerly possess'd by the Earl of <HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P>In this Disposition things remained till the King's Return; the Lord <HI>Townshend</HI>'s Remove affected no
<PB N="40" REF="305"/>
more for the present than himself; and tho' there were many Divisions talked of, which also seemed irreconcileable; yet the King's Judgment and Au∣thority reconciled them all again, till they broke out anew upon another Occasion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King prepar'd to come home, the Queen of <HI>Prussia</HI> his Majesty's Daugh∣ter, who came on purpose to make a Visit to her Father, had taken her Leave; the Treaty with <HI>France</HI> was finished, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> came into it, by which either Party were Guarantees to each other for the present State of Affairs, and Stipulations made for the Quota's of Troops to be supply'd to each in Case of being attack?d thus, <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>States-General</HI> were Guarantees to the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> for the Succession; <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> Guarantees to the <HI>States-General</HI> for the Barrier Treaty; and <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the <HI>States-General</HI> Guarantees to <HI>France</HI> for the Renunciations, all which are, it is said, included in the Treaty.</P>
<P>The next Thing the King had to do, was an Inter∣view with the Czar of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> which it was ex∣pected should have been in <HI>Holland;</HI> but the Czar was indispos'd, and the King's insisting upon the Czar's removing his Troops out of <HI>Mecklemburgh,</HI> gave that Prince some Distaste, which at present made People expect a Breach, but the Wisdom of both Sides prevented the ill Consequences; the good Understanding seem'd afterwards to be Esta∣blish'd, and the Czar did (tho' not without Regret) withdraw his Troops, whether there is not some se∣cret Distaste remaining upon that Score, Time may perhaps discover.</P>
<P>These Things being all over, the King having finished all the Foreign Business which lay before him, set out from <HI>Hanover</HI> on <HI>Tuesday the 19th,</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="306"/>
New-stile, and arriv'd at <HI>Osnaburgh</HI> that Night, where his Royal Highness the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> his Majesty's Brother, and Bishop of <HI>Osnaburgh,</HI> was gone before to Entertain him, the <HI>21st,</HI> his Majesty came to <HI>Loo,</HI> where he was met and complimented by the Princess Dowager of <HI>Nassau-Friesland,</HI> and her Children; the <HI>23d,</HI> his Majesty came to <HI>Utrecht</HI> in the Afternoon, and making but a very short stay there, lay that Night at <HI>Vlaerden,</HI> having been at∣tended to <HI>Utrecht</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Cadogan,</HI> and Mr. Secretary <HI>Stanhope.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the <HI>14th</HI> of <HI>January, O. S.</HI> His Ma∣jesty set out from <HI>Vlaerden</HI> at Four in the Afternoon, and lay that Night on Board the <HI>States</HI> Yatcht in the <HI>Maese.</HI> On the <HI>15th,</HI> his Majesty pass'd through the <HI>Old Maese,</HI> and at Three in the Afternoon landed at <HI>Helvoet-Sluys,</HI> and lay there that Night. On the <HI>16th,</HI> his Majesty Embark'd, and lay that Night on Board the <HI>Carolina</HI> Yatcht. On the <HI>17th,</HI> about Two in the Afternoon, the Squadron, commanded by Admiral <HI>Aylmer,</HI> with the Yatchts, sailed out of the <HI>Goree:</HI> The next Day, about three in the Af∣ternoon, his Majesty landed at <HI>Margate,</HI> and lay that Night at <HI>Canterbury.</HI> On <HI>Saturday</HI> the <HI>19th,</HI> about Six in the Morning, he came by Coach from <HI>Canterbury:</HI> Between three and four in the After∣noon, he was met on <HI>Black-Heath</HI> by the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> with a great Number of the Nobility and Gentry, and other Persons of Distinction. And ha∣ving, with great Affection, Embrac'd his Royal Highness in his Arms, took him in his Coach, and they came from thence together; then passing thro' the City, they arriv'd at St. <HI>James</HI>'s about Six in the Evening; the People all the Way ma∣king Acclamations for his happy Return:
<PB N="42" REF="307"/>
In the Evening there were Bonfires, Illuminati∣ons, and all other Demonstrations of Joy.</P>
<P>The King being return'd, all Eyes were turn'd to∣wards the Court, and it was surprising to find, that no farther Changes were made; the Breach at Court seem'd to be heal'd, and the King appear'd pleased with every Body, every Body seem'd pleas'd with one another; the Lord <HI>Townshend</HI> appear'd at Court on one hand, and the King shew'd him several Marks of particular Respect, and his Lordship on the other hand accepted to be Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and was publickly declar'd to be so in Council, which he had for some time before declin'd; so that now all Things seem'd reconcil'd again at Court, nor were there any more Removes so much as talk'd of, except, that Mr. <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortescue-Aland,</HI> an eminent Council at Law was made one of the Barons of the Exchequer; and Sir <HI>William Thompson,</HI> Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> was made Sollicitor-General.</P>
<P>But this Harmony continu'd but a little while, and the second Rupture which follow'd, was so much worse than the first, by how much it seem'd impossible ever to be made up, and has continu'd so indeed ever since.</P>
<P>The King being arriv'd, the sitting of the Parlia∣ment was expected, and that with some Impatience, because it was in this approaching Session, that the great Attempt was to be made to reduce the Interest of the Funds, and lessen thereby, and at last pay off the Nation's Debts; the Proposals for this had been made Publick, and they came handed into the World with such seeming Authority, that it was not doubted, but they were the Result of those Schemes which were really laid for the putting it in Executi∣on, as indeed it afterwards appear'd to be, and the Divisions upon these Things without Doors, was so
<PB N="43" REF="308"/>
great, that really the People wanted the Parliament to meet to put an End to them, for the Price of all publick Things was uncertain, none knew how or what to buy or sell, or how to value his own Estate.</P>
<P>But the meeting of the Parliament was yet far∣ther delay'd, upon a new Incident from Abroad, this was the Rumour of a Plot forming in <HI>Sweden</HI> for invading the King's Dominions in Favour of the <HI>Pretender</HI> by the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>This made so much Noise for a while, that tho' by the Event there may have been some room to doubt, whether there was any such Design or no, or whether there were any such Preparations at <HI>Gottem∣burgh</HI> as was pretended, yea or no, yet for a time the whole Kingdom was amused with it, and per∣suaded to believe, and expect every Day an Army of Veteran <HI>Swedes,</HI> and a strong Squadron of Men of War with them, to Land even in the Heart of the Kingdom, nay, some were so forward as to tell us, they would even come up the River, and Land with∣in a few Marches of the City of <HI>London,</HI> depending upon Thousands of People here to join them.</P>
<P>The Pretence was specious indeed, supposing it to be only a Pretence, which however I will not affirm, and the Nation exceedingly alarm'd at it for a while. It was about the End of <HI>January,</HI> as we were told, that the Government had secret Intelli∣gence of a concerted Design to Foment a new Re∣bellion, under the Protection of some Foreign Troops to be procur'd from Abroad, and that this Design was carry'd on between some Foreign Ministers Abroad, and some of the Pretender's Friends here at Home, and such Progress was made in the Discovery, that on the <HI>29th,</HI> the King order'd an Account of it to be laid before the Privy-Council, that the farther Proceedings upon it might be carry'd on in a more
<PB N="44" REF="309"/>
formal Method, according to the ordinary Course of Justice.</P>
<P>The whole Relation of the farther Proceedings on this Affair having been published at the Time of them by so many Hands, cannot be mistaken, and are Word for Word with very little Omissions for the Sake of Brevity, as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>30th</HI> very early, <HI>viz.</HI> about Two a Clock in the Morning, an Officer of the Guards with some Musqueteers, were sent to the House of Count <HI>Gyllenborg,</HI> the <HI>Swedish</HI> Envoy, with Orders to secure the Avenues to the House, and were fol∣lowed by Lieutenant General <HI>Wade,</HI> with Orders to Seize all his Papers, and to set a Guard upon his Person, and suffer none to speak with him; but not to remove him out of his own House.</P>
<P>The Count, surprized with the Message which was first delivered at his Door by the Officer, refused for some time to admit them, and Claiming the Pri∣vilege of an Ambassador, pretended to Defend him∣self; but being quickly made sensible, that if he attempted that, they should make very short work with him, that the Officer was not answerable for any Mistake in the Orders to seize him; but that his Business was to execute those Orders, which he was obliged to do, and would immediately perform; being, I say, made sensible of this, he found it convenient to submit; but, as it was said, took Oc∣casion in those few Minutes of Parley, to destroy such Papers as he had near at Hand, and which he was conscious he ought not to let be taken about him; and thus the Officer being let in, the Envoy was put under Arrest in his own House, the Officer who was left to guard him, having Orders to suffer no one to speak with him, nor him to speak with any one by Night or by Day, except in his hearing.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="310"/>
It will not be wonder'd at, that such an Affair as this made a great Noise, as is usual in such Cases: All the Foreign Ministers appeared the next Day at Court, to learn the Reasons of such a Proceeding, and to crave leave that the <HI>Swedish</HI> Minister might be allowed the Privilege of an Ambassador, accor∣ding to the Law of Nations. They receiv'd for the present, an Answer in general, that in a Day or two they should be fully acquainted with the Rea∣sons of such a Proceeding; and accordingly on the <HI>first</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> which was but two Days after, the following Letter was sent by Mr. Secretary <HI>Stan∣hope,</HI> and Mr. Secretary <HI>Methuen,</HI> to all the Foreign Ministers, to give them reasonable Satisfaction in this Affair.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE King having received reiterated Advices, and having incontestable Proofs of several very dangerous Practices which have been managed and con∣ducted, for some time by the Count <HI>de Gyllen∣borg,</HI> Minister of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> here, and which plainly tended to foment, in his Maje∣sty's

Dominions, a Re∣bellion of his own Sub∣jects, which was to be supported by Foreign Troops; and the said Count having, by such Conduct, violated the publick Faith, and ren∣der'd himself unworthy of that Protection, which otherwise he ought to have enjoy'd by the Law of Nations, and of the Privileges due to his Character; his Majesty, to put an End to such pernicious Practices, and to preserve the Peace and Tranquillity of his Do∣minions, judg'd it abso∣lutely necessary to cause the said Count <HI>de Gyllen∣borg</HI> to be seiz'd, and to possess himself of all his Papers, by which the per∣nicious Intrigues where∣in he hath been engaged, will appear to all the World, and sufficiently justify the Measures his Majesty has thought fit to take. I don't doubt, but the King will, in a little time, order me to inform you more fully of the Reasons which have
<PB N="47" REF="312"/>
induc'd his Majesty to take this Resolution: But in the mean while, I am charged to com∣municate to you, by his Order, what has been done already, to the end you may impart the same to your Court; his Majesty no ways doubting, but that when your Master shall be fully inform'd of the said Count's Behaviour, he will be entirely con∣vinced, that not only the Peace and Tranquillity of his Majesty's Domi∣nions, but likewise the Repose of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Security of the pre∣sent Alliances, have ren∣der'd this Procedure in∣dispensably necessary.

<P>But Matters did not End here, for the Govern∣ment had found Means to fix all these Negotiations upon a Person beyond the Seas; and tho' Count <HI>Gyllenborg</HI>'s Letters had not pointed it out to them, yet they knew very well who the Count's Principal Correspondent was, <HI>viz.</HI> The Baron <HI>Gortz,</HI> a Per∣son, who, tho' he was properly a Minister of the
<PB N="50" REF="315"/>
Duke of <HI>Holstein's,</HI> yet at this time was appointed by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to negotiate his Affairs in divers Courts abroad, and in particular, in the Treaty at <HI>Brunswick,</HI> if it had gone for∣ward.</P>
<P>Besides what private Information the Govern∣ment had of this, the Letters seiz'd among Count <HI>Gyllenborg</HI>'s Papers, confirming every thing, led them as it were by the Hand into the Particulars, so that they now wanted no farther Light into that Part of the Conspiracy: It remained only to con∣trive some Method how to get this warm Agent of the Party into their Hands, which they quickly found means to bring to pass.</P>
<P>The Baron had been at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and was come from thence into <HI>Flanders,</HI> from whence he was expected back at the <HI>Hague</HI> the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>January, N.S.</HI> and the Intelligence of this being well-grounded, Orders were dispatched to Mr. <HI>Leathes,</HI> the <HI>British</HI> Resident at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to apply himself with the greatest Secresie possible to the States General, to obtain leave to Arrest and Secure the Baron <HI>Gortz</HI> in the Name of the King of <HI>England,</HI> which, as he was under no publick Cha∣racter immediately to the said States, was a Favour they could not refuse. The <HI>British</HI> Resident dis∣charg'd himself of these Orders so well, that he obtained all that he desired, and executed the Au∣thority he obtained in the following manner.</P>
<P>The Baron arriv'd at the <HI>Hague</HI> perfectly secure, and on the Day he was expected; it seems, till then he was wholly ignorant of the Fate of Count <HI>Gyl∣lenborg,</HI> and appeared to be in a great Surprize when he receiv'd an Account of it, and was in the utmost Confusion when he was privately informed,
<PB N="51" REF="316"/>
that he was in some Danger of the same Fate him∣self; for it seems some secret Friend of his had gotten knowledge of it time enough to inform him of it, and he lost no time to provide for his own Safety; for he immediately set out from the <HI>Hague</HI> in the privatest Manner he could in a Post Chaise, accompanied only with the <HI>Polish</HI> General <HI>Poni∣atowski,</HI> and went directly for <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> judging rightly, that he had no Time to lose; and indeed had he used the same Dexterity there, he had gotten perfectly clear: That he had no Time to lose was most certain, for he had not been many Mi∣nutes gone before a Detachment of the Blue Guards was sent to his House to Arrest him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Leathes,</HI> Resident of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who arrived from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> much about that time, hear∣ing of the Escape of the said Baron <HI>de Gortz,</HI> went back thither immediately, and upon Advice that the <HI>20th,</HI> being <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, the said Baron <HI>de Gortz</HI> was set out from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> he employ'd Commissary <HI>Vleertman</HI> to follow him, with another Gentleman; and they used so much Diligence, that notwithstanding the <HI>Swedish</HI> Minister was gone some Hours before them, they arrived at Night, much about the same time, at the Gates of <HI>Arnheim,</HI> which being opened, Mr. <HI>Vleertman</HI> followed, at some distance, the said Baron <HI>de Gortz</HI> to an Inn, and immediately went to the chief Burgomaster, who rising from Bed, upon Notice given him, that that Gentleman had something to impart to him from the <HI>States,</HI> was acquainted with the Orders given to secure the Baron <HI>de Gortz,</HI> whereupon two Town Officers and some Soldiers were sent to seize him and his Papers, and they brought him, with his Secretary, to the Town-House.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="317"/>
The Seizing this Gentleman made a great Noise, and the <HI>Swedish</HI> Resident in <HI>Holland</HI> reclaim'd him in the Name of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> and presented a Memorial to the <HI>States,</HI> to which he annexed an authentick Copy of the full Powers given by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to the Baron <HI>Gortz,</HI> alledging, That he ought to be look'd upon as a Publick Mini∣ster, and that the Law of Nations had been violated in the Seizing a Person, who was even in that Country under a publick Character.</P>
<P>Hitherto the Weight of Things lay upon Count <HI>Gyllenborg</HI> and the Baron <HI>Gortz,</HI> and it might be true that they were embark'd with the <HI>Preten∣der</HI>'s Party here, for ought appear'd to the con∣trary; but the Question seem'd to remove from thence to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> himself; who seem'd to be Charged with a Visible design in favour of the <HI>Pretender;</HI> what Evidence there was that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was concern'd in it, or that what these Gentlemen, tho' they were his Majestys Agents, had done by his Orders and structions, may be enquired as I go along: I must profess to see very little of it hitherto, and the dis∣missing the two <HI>Swedish</HI> Ministers afterwards, in the Manner they were dismiss'd, seems to me not to im∣port, that the Concern the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was said to have in it, did sufficiently appear; but that is not the present Business, I return to the Fact.</P>
<P>On the <HI>20th</HI> of the next Month, <HI>(viz.) February,</HI> the Parliament met pursuant to the Prorogation, and the King open'd the Session with the following Speech, in which his Majesty took publick Notice of this Affair.</P>
<Q><PB N="53" REF="318"/>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I <HI>Was in hopes that the Success which it pleased God to give Ʋs, in Defeating the late Rebellion, might have secured to the Nation Peace, Plenty, and Tranquillity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Endeavours have not been wanting, during your Recess, to improve the happy Prospect which was in View, by entring into such Negotiations as I judged most conducive to those good Ends; and 'tis with Pleasure I can acquaint you, that many Defects in the Treaties of</HI> Utrecht, <HI>which very nearly affected the Trade, and even the Security of these Kingdoms, have been remedy'd by subse∣quent Conventions, the happy Consequences of which have already very sensibly appeared by the Flourish∣ing Condition of our Trade and Credit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>By the Alliance lately concluded with</HI> France, <HI>and the</HI> States-General, <HI>We are soon to be Eased of all future Apprehensions from</HI> Dunkirk <HI>and</HI> Mardyke: <HI>The</HI> Pretender <HI>is actually removed beyond the</HI> Alps; <HI>his Adherents are deprived of all Hopes of Support and Countenance from</HI> France; <HI>and even the Assistance of that Crown is Stipulated to Us in case of Exigency.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It seemed reasonable to expect, that such a Sci∣tuation of Affairs at Home and Abroad should have recovered from their Delusion all such of our Subjects as had Unhappily been Seduced by the Craft and Wickedness of Desperate and Ill-designing Men, and thereby have afforded Me the Opportunity, which I desired, of following the Natural Bent of My own Inclinations to Lenity, by Opening this Ses∣sion with an Act of Grace; but such is the Obsti∣nate and Inveterate Rancour of a Faction amongst</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="319"/>
<HI>Ʋs, that it hath again prompted them to animate and stir up Foreign Powers to disturb the Peace of their Native Country; they will chuse rather to make</HI> Britain <HI>a Scene of Blood and Confusion, and to Venture even the putting this Kingdom under a Foreign Yoke, than give over their darling Design of Imposing a Popish Pretender.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have Ordered to be laid before You, Copies of Letters which have passed between the</HI> Swedish <HI>Mi∣nisters on this Occasion, which contain a certain Account of the projected Invasion; and I promise My Self from your experienced Zeal and Affection to my Person and Government, that you will come to such Resolutions as will enable Me, by the Blessing of God, to defeat all the Designs of Our Enemies against Ʋs.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I did hope the putting an End to the late Re∣bellion would have so far secured the Peace and Tranquillity of the Nation, that I might, consistent∣ly with the Safety of My People, have made a con∣siderable Reduction of the Forces; but the Prepa∣rations which are making from Abroad to Invade Us, oblige Me to ask such Supplies as you shall find absolutely Necessary for the Defence of the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You are all Sensible of the Insupportable Weight of the National D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bts, which the Publick became Engaged for, from the Necessity of the Times, the Pressu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of a long and expensive War, and the lan∣guishing State of Publick Credit; but the Scene being n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w so happily changed, if no new Disturbances shall pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nge Ʋs again into Streights and Difficulties, the general Expectation seems to require of You, that</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="320"/>
<HI>You should turn your Thoughts toward some Method of extricating Your Selves, by Reducing, by Degrees, the Debts of the Nation.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>I have an entire Confidence in You, and have there∣fore nothing to ask, but that you would take such Mea∣sures as will best Secure your Religion and Liber∣ties: While you preserve those inestimable Blessings, I shall sit Easie and Safe on My Throne, having no other View but the Happiness and Prosperity of My People.</HI></P></Q>
<P>According to the Contents of this Speech, the next Day the Letters of Count <HI>Gyllenborg</HI> were, by his Majesty's special Command, laid before the House of Commons, and were afterwards made Publick by the Order of the Government.</P>
<P>It would have been very necessary for the Infor∣mation of the Reader, and for convincing them more effectually of the Reality of this Conspiracy, which is so confidently ridiculed and denied: I say, it would have been very necessary to have transmit∣ted to Posterity the full Copies of these Letters at large; but the Brevity of these Annals will not per∣mit it.</P>
<P>The Addresses of both Houses to the King, in return to this Speech, tho' I have very little Room for such Things, cannot be omitted, because they shew how readily the Houses came into such Things as these, and that Readiness will occasion farther Speculations as I go on: The Addresses therefore, and Answers to them, are as follow, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<PB N="56" REF="321"/>
<Q><P>The LORD's Address.</P>
<P>Most Gracious Sovereign,</P>
<P><HI>WE your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal Sub∣jects, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled, beg leave to return your Maje∣sty our most humble and hearty Thanks for your Majesty's most gracious Speech from the Throne; and to congratulate your Majesty on your safe and happy Return to these your Dominions; and on the prudent Administration of his Royal Highness the Prince of</HI> Wales, <HI>under your Majesty, and the great Care he took of the Peace and Security of the Kingdom, during your Majesty's Absence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We are sensible, that the</HI> gross Defects <HI>and</HI> perni∣cious Consequences <HI>of the late Treaty of</HI> Utrecht <HI>could not have been remedied, but by your Majesty's unweary'd Application for the Good of your Sub∣jects; and by that just Regard which is paid by Fo∣reign Potentates to your known Wisdom and Integrity. It is with unspeakable Satisfaction, that we see your Majesty's Endeavours Successful in such Conventi∣ons, as have already given new Life to our Trade and Credit; and particularly in the Treaty lately concluded with</HI> France <HI>and the</HI> States-General. <HI>As your Majesty has, by this Treaty, recovered to us, in so great a Measure, those Advantages, which might have been expected from a</HI> Glorious and Successful War, <HI>and were given up by a</HI> Treacherous and Dis∣honourable Peace; <HI>we beg Leave to congratulate your Majesty upon an Alliance, which opens to us so fair a Prospect of an undisturb'd Succession, an equal Balance of Power, and a flourishing Commerce.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="322"/>
<HI>We return your Majesty our most humble Thanks for your Majesty's most gracious Condescension, in having laid before your Parliament the Discoveries concerning the intended Invasion; and cannot but regard, with the utmost Horror and Indignation, the Malice and Ingratitude of those, who have en∣courag'd such an Attempt against their King and Country.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We are sorry to find, that your Majesty's Lenity has been ineffectual, towards reclaiming a</HI> Faction, <HI>who have render'd themselves so Obnoxious to your Justice; and We do assure your Majesty, that we will, to the utmost of our Power, support your Ma∣jesty against the design'd Invasion, and all your Ene∣mies, both at Home and Abroad, in such a manner, that, by the Blessing of Almighty God, neither the Rashness of the one, nor the Wickedness of the o∣ther, shall be ever able to prevail.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>The King's Answer to this Address was as fol∣lows.</P>
<P>My Lords,</P>
<P>I <HI>Thank you for this Address, which is so full of Expressions of Duty to Me, and Zeal for your Country; and I make no doubt, but that, with your Support and Assistance, under God, We shall get the better of all Our Enemies, both at Home and Abroad.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>The Commons Address is as follows:</P>
<P>Most Gracious Sovereign,</P>
<P><HI>YOUR Majesty's Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, the Commons of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>in Parliament <HI>assem∣bled,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="323"/>
return your Majesty their humblest Thanks for your most gracious Speech from the Throne. Your Majesty's safe and happy Return into your Kingdoms, gave an universal Joy to all your People; and as the prudent Administration of the Government, by his Royal Highness the Prince of</HI> Wales, <HI>under your Ma∣jesty, did, in some degree, make the Want of your Royal Presence more easie to us, we beg leave to con∣gratulate your Majesty upon the Peace and Security, that, during your Majesty's Absence, was, by the great Care of his Royal Highness, preserv'd in the Kingdom, to the general Satisfaction of all your Sub∣jects. We can never sufficiently acknowledge the re∣peated Instances of your Majesty's Goodness, and un∣wearied Concern for the Welfare of your Kingdoms; We see with Admiration, many of the fatal Defects of the Treaties at</HI> Utrecht, <HI>and the great Disadvan∣tages that were imposed upon this Nation, at the Head of a victorious Army, and powerful Confedera∣cy, happily remedy'd by your Majesty, even in the midst of intestine Dangers and Troubles. Your con∣summate Wisdom has renewed those Alliances that were basely betray'd and dissolved, and concluded such new Treaties, as may render the Peace safe and lasting; and we are at a Loss to determine whether, in future Ages, the suffering the Demolition of the Port of</HI> Dunkirk <HI>to be scandalously evaded, will be a greater Reproach, or the procuring the Destruction of the Sluices of</HI> Mardyke, <HI>a greater Honour to the</HI> British <HI>Nation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We cannot at the same Time, but with the highest Resentment and Indignation, look upon the obstinate and inveterate Rancour of those, who are again en∣deavouring to embroil their native Country in Blood and Confusion: It is astonishing to find, that any,</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="324"/>
<HI>who call themselves Protestants, can be so inflexible and restless in their Endeavours, to impose upon us a Popish Pretender, and rather venture to subject the Kingdom to a Foreign Yoke, than depart from their darling and avow'd Design of altering and sub∣verting the present happy Establishment in the Pro∣testant Succession. We adore the watchful Eye of Heaven, that has so wonderfully guarded and pro∣tected your sacred Person, and cannot too much ex∣tol the Wisdom and Vigilance that has been used, in so early and seasonably discovering this desperate Attempt: And in order most effectually to defeat it, your faithful Commons, with Hearts sincerely Zea∣lous in the Cause of their King and Country, as∣sure your Majesty that they will, to the utmost, stand by and support your Majesty against all your Enemies at Home and Abroad, that shall, in any manner, pre∣sume to aid and abet the Pretender to your Crown, and will most chearfully grant to your Majesty such Supplies as shall be found necessary for the Safety of your Royal Person, and the Defence of the King∣dom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We are all but too sensible of the unsupportable Weight of the National Debts, and therefore will not neglect to apply our selves, with all possible Di∣ligence and Attention, to the great and necessary Work of reducing and lessening, by Degrees, this heavy Burthen, which may prove the most effectual Means of preserving to the Publick Funds a real and certain Security.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>To which Address the King was pleased to return the following Answer:</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="325"/>
Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>THE Duty and Zeal, which you express in this Loyal Address, to my Person and Go∣vernment, your affectionate Concern for the Welfare of your Country, your Promises of an effectual Sup∣port against all our Enemies at Home and Abroad, and your Resolution of applying your selves to ease my People, by reducing gradually the heavy Load of the Publick Debts, deserves my hearty Thanks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You shall never have Cause to repent of the Confi∣dence you repose in me: The Honour, Welfare, and Prosperity of the Nation being what I have chiefly at Heart.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Whether the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was Party to the Designs of his Ministers, as above, or not; a thing which has not since appear'd to me so plain as might be expected; I say, whether his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty was Party to it or not, the Resentment of the Parliament seem'd levell'd at him in Particular, in the very first Step the Parliament took in this Affair; for they immediately voted a Bill to be brought in, to empower the King to prohibit Com∣merce to <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>This, I say, was, the next to arresting the Two Gentlemen, the first Act of Resentment shew'd on this Affair against <HI>Sweden</HI> as a Nation, and was carried with such Readiness and Alacrity in the Two Houses, that it was brought into the House but the <HI>d,</HI> and it receiv'd the Royal Assent the <HI>27th;</HI> and immediately the King, by Proclamation, reciting the said Act, and the Reasons of it, prohi∣bited the <HI>Swedish</HI> Trade for a Year certain.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="326"/>
This Act being pass'd, the House meddled no more with it, but left it all in the Breast of the King, applying themselves to the more immediate Business of their Session, <HI>(viz.)</HI> raising Money, which was first by a Land Tax, which was settled at <HI>3 s. per l.</HI></P>
<P>It was observable that the Land Tax, which usually was pass'd before <HI>Christmas,</HI> being not now voted till the middle of March, the Publick Af∣fairs were in Danger of being put to some Streight for Money; that is to say, as to Time, whereupon the House passed a Resolution as follows.</P>
<Q><P>Resolv'd, <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI></P>
<P><HI>That whosoever shall advance, or lend any Sum, not exceeding Six Hundred Thousand Pounds, for the Service of the Publick</HI> by Sea or Land, <HI>shall be repaid the same</HI> with Interest at 4 per Cent. <HI>out of the first Aid to be granted this Session of Parlia∣ment.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This prov'd a wrong Step, for this Clause of ad∣vancing Money at <HI>4 per Cent.</HI> Interest, put the Question out of all manner of Dispute among the Money'd Men, that Interest of Money would be reduced this Session to <HI>4 per Cent.</HI> especially, that the Interest of the Funds would fall to <HI>4 per Cent.</HI> and this put the City Misers, and the Money'd Men, into a terrible Fright; and in a Word, no Body, for some Time, brought any Money, that is, any Sums considerable upon the Credit of that Vote, nor did it at all answer the Expectations of the People who contrived it; and because this great Affair was now very quickly brought to a Conclusion, I shall put the whole Transaction of
<PB N="62" REF="327"/>
it together: That the Reduction of the Interest of the Funds was projected, and Schemes for it prepar'd in the Treasury, Mr. <HI>Walpole,</HI> who was then first Commissioner, and therefore at the Head of that Affair, had publickly own'd and declared in the House, that by a fix'd Day he would make a Pro∣posal to the House for reducing the publick Debts.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Discontents of the Peo∣ple about the Funds, and the Fears they were un∣der for their Properties, grew very popular, and Mr. <HI>L—mere</HI> proposed a Vote to the House, which whether it was ill-natur'd or not, as some said, or that it was pointed in particular at the Schemes which were preparing, I do not affirm; but had it pass'd as propos'd, Mr. <HI>Wa—le</HI> might have put an End to that Part of his Work: The Vote was this, <HI>(viz.) That this House will make good all Parliamen∣tary Engagements.</HI> Mr. <HI>W—le</HI> was too penetrating not to see what would be the Consequence of this Vote, and too ready in his Turns not to give it a Cast that quite overset the Design, <HI>(viz.)</HI> by mo∣ving that the Vote might pass, with the Addition of the Word Deficiencies; this was thought reason∣able, and so the Vote pass'd thus: <HI>Resolv'd, That this House will make good the Deficiencies of all Par∣liamentary Engagements.</HI></P>
<P>This Addition entirely destroy'd and disarm'd the Motion it self, and yet it had the Effect it was mov'd for, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That it satisfy'd the People, that they should not have any unjust Invasion of their Proper∣ties; and so Mr. <HI>Wa—le</HI> went on as he began.</P>
<P>In the Interval, between this Vote and the Time Mr. <HI>Wa—le</HI> took to bring in his Scheme, the House ordered in <HI>An Account of the Publick Debts at the Exchequer, as they then stood, distinguishing what</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="328"/>
<HI>the Funds were, when granted, how long since gran∣ted, what Term remain'd, how much the Original Principal Money was, how much had been since paid off, and how much remain'd, and what the Annual Interest was, that is paid or payable for the Principal Sums advanced:</HI> Which Account, three Days after, was laid before the Commons, by a Person from the Earl of <HI>Hallifax,</HI> Auditor of the Receipt at the <HI>Exchequer.</HI></P>

Upon the Day appointed, Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> brought in his Scheme for the reducing the Debts, and ha∣ving in the mean time negotiated with the Bank and the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, to perform their Parts if required, he presented it to the House, and had it debated at large; the Scheme indeed met with some Opposition, and, as is often the Case in other Things, more perhaps from those who did not un∣derstand it, than from those who did: However in the End the House came into it, and from thence proceeded the Reductions which now take Place, and which are express'd in the following Vote.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That all the Publick Funds, redeemable by Law, that do not exceed</HI> 5 l. per Cent. per Ann. <HI>be redeemed according to the respective Proviso's or Clauses of Redemption, contained in the Acts of Parliament for that Purpose, or (with Consent of the Proprietors) be converted into an Interest or Annuity, not exceeding</HI> 5 l. per Cent. per An∣num, <HI>redeemable by Parliament.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That His Majesty be enabled to borrow of any Person or Persons, Bodies Politick or Corporate, such Sum or Sums of Money as shall be requisite to redeem the said redeemable Funds, at any Rate, not exceeding</HI> 5 l. per Cent. per Annum, <HI>and to secure the same upon the Funds so to be redeemed.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>That the Annuity of</HI> 106, 501 l. 10 s. 5 d. per Annum, <HI>payable to the Governour and Com∣pany of the Bank of</HI> England, <HI>out of the House-Money, by virtue of several Acts of Parliament in that Behalf, for the Principal Sum of</HI> 1, 775, 027 l 17 s. 10 d. Half-penny, <HI>by them advanced, be re∣deemed, or (by Consent of the said Governour and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> converted into an Interest or Annuity</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="354"/>
<HI>not to exceed</HI> 5 l. per Cent. per Annum, <HI>redeem∣able by Parliament.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>That so much of the Fund, commonly called the Aggregate Fund, settled by an Act of Parlia∣ment in the first Year of the Reign of his present Majesty, as is applicable to the Interest, Circulati∣on, Exchanging or Cancelling the present Exchequer Bills, be also redeemed.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>That his Majesty be enabled to authorize the High-Treasurer, or the Commissioners of the Trea∣sury for the Time being, to treat and agree with a∣ny Person or Persons, Bodies Politick or Corporate, for circulating such a Number of Exchequer Bills, at a Rate not exceeding</HI> 4 l. 10 s. per Cent. per Annum, <HI>for Interest, Exchanging, and Circulati∣on, as may be charged and secured upon that Part of the said Aggregate Fund so to be redeemed.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>That the Annuities of</HI> 600, 000 l. <HI>and</HI> 8000 l. per Annum, <HI>payable to the Governour and Company of Merchants of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>Trading to the</HI> South-Sea, <HI>be also redeemed.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>That the Annuities payable by an Act of Par∣liament of the Twelfth Year of the Reign of King</HI> William <HI>(of glorious Memory) to certain Patentees therein named, their Heirs and Assigns, out of the Weekly Sum of</HI> 3700 l. <HI>charged on the Excise, be also redeemed.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>That the several Terms of Years remain∣ing in the Duties appropriated by the Two Lottery-Acts, made and passed in the Ninth Year of the Reign of her late Majesty Queen</HI> Anne <HI>(of blessed Memory) and by the Two Lottery-Acts made and passed in the Tenth Year of her late Majesty's Reign, be made Perpetual.</HI></P>
<PB N="90" REF="355"/>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>That the said Duties, comprehended in the said Four Lottery-Acts, be made one general Fund for the Future.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. <HI>That the Proprietors of the Orders grounded on the said Lottery-Acts, do, within a limited Time, make their Elections, either to accept An∣nuities after the Rate of</HI> 5 l. per Cent. per An∣num, <HI>redeemable by Parliament, out of such gene∣ral Fund, or be paid so much as remains due to them on their Orders respectively.</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. <HI>That in all Cases where the Proprietors shall chuse to have their Principal, the</HI> 5 l. per Cent. per Annum <HI>saved thereby, be made another Fund, towards answering such Sums of Money as shall be advanced (towards discharging the said Principal) by Loans, or other Securities, as shall be thought proper.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>That his Majesty be enabled to give Power for receiving voluntary Subscriptions from any Person or Persons entituled to any of the Annuities issuing out of the Publick Funds, for the Residue of the respective Terms of</HI> 99, 96, 89, <HI>or 32 Years, formerly purchased therein, (not being subject to Redemption) who shall be willing to accept, in lieu thereof, perpetual Annuities redeemable by Parlia∣ment, and to allow for the remaining Terms in the said Annuities, which were purchased for</HI> 99, 96, <HI>or 89 Years, (at the Election of the respective Sub∣scribers) either so much as the same Annuities shall amount to at 19 Years Purchase, to be made good by new Annuities of</HI> 4 l. per Cent. per Annum, <HI>re∣deemable by Parliament, or 17 Years and a half Purchase, to be made good by new Annuities of</HI> 5 l. per Cent. per Annum, <HI>to be redeemable in like manner; and to allow for the remaining Terms in the said Annuities, which were purchased for</HI> 32
<PB N="91" REF="356"/>
<HI>Years (at the Election of the respective Subscribers) either so much as the same Annuities shall amount to at 14 Years and a half Purchase, to be made good by new Annuities of</HI> 4 l. per Cent. per Annum, <HI>redeemable by Parliament, or 13 Years and a half Purchase, to be made good by Annuities of</HI> 5 l. per Cent. per Annum, <HI>redeemable in like manner, and that the said New Annuities shall be settled and secured accordingly.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. <HI>That all Savings that shall arise upon any of the present Funds, by the proposed Redemptions or Reductions, be reserv'd and apply'd, after all Deficiencies that may happen upon any of the said Funds are made good, towards discharging and re∣ducing the National Debt.</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. <HI>That all the said Duties now in being, or to be continued, shall immediately cease and deter∣mine, after the said National Debt, and all Inte∣rest due thereupon, is discharged and paid off.</HI></P>
<P>These Votes give us a full View of that Affair, and the Acts of Parliament subsequent to them, which are to be found upon Record, will fully in∣form those who are curious to enquire farther; and thus this troublesome Affair was ended, to the general Satisfaction.</P>
<P>As for the Disputes which happen'd about a far∣ther Reduction of Forces, and the Regulation of those which were to be kept on Foot, they did indeed stir a little; but the Affair of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Invasion, which was now upon the Anvil, silenc'd all those Things for this Session, we shall hear more of them in the next: I will not justify the Words of those who ventur'd to talk as if that were one of the Causes of bringing it upon the Stage.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="357"/>
But Debates of another Nature came upon the Stage, in which the Ministers so unhappily clash'd with one another, as reviv'd all the Strife mention'd before, and entirely broke the Harmony of the pub∣lick Measures for a while.</P>
<P>It was on the <HI>3d</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> when the King sent the following Message to the House of Commons.</P>
<P>GEORGE <HI>R.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HIS Majesty being desirous, above all Things, not only to secure his Kingdoms against the present Danger, with which they are threaten'd from</HI> Sweden, <HI>but likewise to prevent, as far as is possible, the like Apprehensions for the future, thinks it necessary, that such Measures should be early con∣certed with other Princes and States, as may con∣duce most effectually to this End.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as this may require some Expence, His Ma∣jesty hopes that his Commons will, by their Assi∣stance at this Juncture, enable Him to make good such Engagements, as may case his People of all future Charge and Apprehensions upon this Ac∣count.</HI></P>
<P>This Message gave Ground of new Contention, and occasion'd very warm Debates, too long to be set down at large, but the Substance of the Objecti∣ons was, that the manner of demanding it without communicating the particular Uses to which it was to be appropriated, was unparliamentary; it was alledg'd, that as they were entrusted to give the Peoples Money for the Publick Occasions, so they could not answer it, as to the Trust their Country reposed in them, to give away that Mo∣ney without knowing what the Occasion was; and indeed, this Argument went a great Way, and
<PB N="93" REF="358"/>
brought some into the Question, who it was not thought could have joined with that Party upon any Account whatever; and tho' it was answered, that there were good Reasons why the Terms of the Alliances to be made, could not safely be Com∣municated; and that to make the Measures pub∣lick, was, in the Nature of the Thing, to destroy them; yet even this did not satisfie: It was then urged, that the King was a Prince of that Integri∣ty and Honour, and had given such convincing Proofs of his disinterested Concern for the true Inte∣rest of the People of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in general, and for their Liberties and Privileges in particular, that they could not scruple to depend, in a Matter of this Nature, upon his Majesty's Justice and Pru∣dence in general, as well as upon his Care for the Nation in particular, and that his Majesty had many ways merited such a Trust as this at their Hands.</P>
<P>But to this a Medium was proposed, <HI>viz.</HI> to pass a Vote in general Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> That the House would effectually make good all such Alliances and Engagements as his Majesty should think fit to enter into for the publick Safety of his Dominions: And this was urg'd against the Argument above, of de∣pending upon his Majesty's Integrity and Honour, <HI>viz.</HI> That such a Vote was a Testimony of their entire Dependence upon the Honour and Integrity of his Majesty, and that in so high a manner, as that more could not be desired of them, and that his Majesty could have no reason to distrust his faithful Commons making good such a Vote.</P>
<P>It would be endless to repeat the Particulars of all the Arguments warmly urged on both sides on this extraordinary Occasion. But upon the whole, it is to be observ'd, that this Question not only di∣vided
<PB N="94" REF="359"/>
the House, but divided the Court, and that to a surprizing Degree, and it was taken notice of in the House; for when one of the contrary Party had in a long Speech insisted, that it was Unpar∣liamentary to grant Money before the Occasion of it was known, and an Estimate of the particular Expence to which it was to be appropriated was laid before the House, he concluded, That the Mes∣sage was so strange in it self, that even the Mini∣stry themselves were unhappily divided about it, and knew not whether they had best be for it, or against it.</P>
<P>And indeed, this was the Difficulty which principally prevented the better receiving this Mes∣sage, and caused a great Party to join in the Oppo∣sing it, who were otherwise very hearty in the King's Interest, and upon all Occasions had shewn themselves so; and in this wrong Step began the Discovery of all the ill Blood that was afterwards found to be among the Statesmen, and which cau∣sed that great Turn at Court, of which we are go∣ing to speak.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> It was found that Mr. <HI>Walpole,</HI> tho' he had always strenuously push'd on the King's In∣terest in every thing, and had been a zealous Asser∣ter of the Protestant Succession, against all that had formerly opposed it, yet in this he seemed at a full stop, and appearing cold and silent in the hot∣test of the Debate, gave every one room to judge, that he was against the Thing; tho' when the Que∣stion was put, he could not decline giving his Vote in favour of it: Even the Speaker of the House al∣so seemed to be on the other side, and in the Com∣mittee spoke against the Thing, as it was stated; being, as he said, not against the Supply, but against
<PB N="95" REF="360"/>
the Demanding and Granting it in such an <HI>unparlia∣mentary Manner.</HI></P>
<P>Nor indeed was it possible to prevent a great ma∣ny other Gentlemen, who were otherwise entirely well affected, and even devoted to the present Settle∣ment, from falling in with that popular Notion, of its being Unparliamentary; so that when it came to be put to the Question in the Committee of the whole House, it pass'd by a Majority of but 15 Voices, <HI>viz.</HI> Yeas 164.

<P>The Vote that was put and pass'd was in the following Terms: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Resolved, <HI>That it is the Opinion of this Committee, that a Sum not exceeding Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Pounds be granted to His Majesty, to enable His Majesty to concert such Measures with Foreign Princes and States, as may prevent any Charge and Apprehension from the Designs of</HI> SWEDEN <HI>for the future.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Nor was this all, for when it was reported by the Chairman, and came again to be Debated in the House, the Struggle was yet harder: And the Question, whether the House should agree with the Committee, was carried but by 4 Voices, <HI>viz.</HI> Yeas 153, Noes 149. So that it seem'd to be a Point gain'd with the utmost Difficulty, and the Consequences of bringing up a Party so near to an Equality with the Interest of the Government, were threatning enough.</P>
<P>In the Debates of this Affair, the future Mea∣sures took their Rise, and the King seem'd resolv'd to let some People know his Mind upon it; for the next Morning Mr Secretary <HI>St inhope,</HI> by particular Command, let the Lord <HI>Townshend</HI> know, that he
<PB N="96" REF="361"/>
had no farther Occasion for his Service as Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and this is the last Time our Annals will find this noble Person at Court. But this was but a bare opening of the Scene, for as the King sent this Person Word he had <HI>no farther Occasion of his Service,</HI> other Gentlemen prevented the Government as it were, and sent Word they had no farther Occasion to serve, that is to say, gave up or quitted their Employments; these were they who were afterward call'd the Resigners: The first of these was Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> himself, Mr. <HI>Methuen</HI> Secretary of State, Mr. <HI>Pulteney</HI> Secretary of War, and several others follow'd this Example: It is too long to enter into the Particulars of this Part, or state the Case of every particular Person, with the supposed Reasons of their Conduct; 'tis enough to Record here the Names of those which resign'd or were dismiss'd, and the Names of those who succeed in their Places; of the first were these, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Upon these Removes it appear'd necessary to grant the House a short Recess, and particularly, there being so many Men advanc'd to publick Employ∣ment, who were Members of the House, and who could not sit again in the House unless they were Re-elected, it was needful to give them some Time to form their Interests in the Country, and be cho∣sen again, as most of them indeed were; for this, and perhaps other Reasons less Publick, the King ordered Mr. <HI>Stanhope</HI> to acquaint the House, that it being his Majesty's Pleasure that the Parliament should be adjourn'd, his Majesty desir'd that they would adjourn themselves to the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>May.</HI> This was the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> so that the Recess was much longer than was expected, being a full Month.</P>
<P>This Recess of the Parliament, gives us room to bring forward the Story of what other material Affairs occurr'd, as well before, as during this time,
<PB N="99" REF="364"/>
that things may be carried on Hand in Hand, one with another, in the same order of Time as they happen'd.</P>
<P>All this while, the Preparations for a vigorous Dealing with the <HI>Swedes</HI> went on; the Fleet, which was determined to be sent to the <HI>Baltick,</HI> began to be ready, and the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>April</HI> set Sail with a fair Wind, under the Command of Sir <HI>George Bing,</HI> and arriv'd the <HI>12th</HI> in the <HI>Sound,</HI> in all, 33 Sail.</P>
<P>And here it is to be noted, that by the late Trea∣ty of Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> one of the Particulars stipulated in the Alliance was, that the Regent of <HI>France</HI> should undertake to remove the Pretender from <HI>Avignon,</HI> where he had resided for some time, indeed for almost all the Time since his Retreat from <HI>Scotland.</HI> This was done publickly by the Regent, and not without some ill Nature and Re∣sentment on both Sides; for the Regent insisted that he should Remove, and the Chevalier refused a good while, and at last comply'd with Reluctance; nor perhaps had not remov'd at all, but by Force, if the Regent had not plough'd with the Heifer, and used some such Arguments with the Queen Dowager, as obliged her to write to the Chevalier to dispute it no longer; in which Particular the Regent shew'd, that he knew how to manage that Affair in a Manner, that he was sure would not be opposed.</P>
<P>The Journal of Circumstances of his Removal are publick, but need not to be reported here at large; this being not a History of the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> but of King <HI>George,</HI> it is sufficient to observe, that he removed from <HI>Avignon</HI> the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> with a Retinue of about 30 Persons; he had a Captain with a Troop of Dragoons, appointed by the Re∣gent to attend him thro' the Territories of <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="365"/>
and also four Commissaries, who were order'd to defray their Expences, which was done till he pass'd the <HI>Pont à Voisin,</HI> being the Bridge which parts or rather joins the Dominions of <HI>France</HI> to those of <HI>Savoy,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> Officer, having Votaries with him, took proper Instruments of Protest, with Witnesses, that the Chevalier, with all his Retinue, were pass'd the said <HI>Pont à Voisin,</HI> the <HI>17th,</HI> into the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and on the Road to <HI>Cham∣berry;</HI> from hence he travel'd on thro' the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Dominions into those of the Pope, where he still remains, and where I shall have occasion to speak of him again.</P>
<P>I return now in the Course of Story to the Affairs of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the Alarm given here upon that Occasion, the Troops the King had on Foot were very considerable, no less than 27000 Men, and up∣on this Occasion were fill'd up and encreased consi∣derably, and a Fleet was fitted out with such Expe∣dition, that 30 Men of War were ready to put to Sea, and did put to Sea by the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> no <HI>Swedes</HI> nor any one else being in any Posture to op∣pose them, nor when they came to the Sound did they find any Fleets prepared, or Army embarking, or indeed any visible Appearance of an Enemy to oppose them.</P>
<P>Upon this News the Hurry went over, the Con∣sternation abated, and repeated Assurances coming over every Day that the Danger was all over, the King resolved to reduce his Army, and to grant the long expected Act of Clemency which so many wanted, and which the several Disorders mention'd had caused to be so often delay'd; all which is fully express'd in the King's Speech which he made to the Parliament, when they return'd after their Ad∣journment above-mention'd: The Speech is as fol∣lows.</P>
<PB N="101" REF="366"/>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>IT is with great Satisfaction, that, after this short Recess, I can acquaint you with the certain Advice I have received, that my Fleet is safely ar∣rived in the</HI> Sound, <HI>which, by the Blessing of Al∣mighty God, will secure these Kingdoms against any immediate Danger of an Invasion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have, by this means, an Opportunity, which is very acceptable to me, of making a considerable Re∣duction in our Land-Forces, having establish'd it as a Rule with my Self, to consult the Ease of my Peo∣ple in every Thing, so far as is consistent with their Safety. And for my own part, as I shall always place my Greatness in the Prosperity of my Sub∣jects, so I shall always desire, that my Power may be founded in their Affections.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is upon these Considerations, that I have given Orders for the immediate Reducing of Ten Thousand Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That nothing may be wanting in me to quiet the Minds of all my Subjects, I have likewise given Di∣rections to prepare an Act of Grace; and however it may be received by those who are obstinately bent on the Ruin of their Country, I promise my self, that it will raise a due Sense of Gratitude in all such as have been artfully misled into Treasonable Practices against my Person and Government, and preserve them from standing in need of the like Mercy for the future, when such an Instance of Clemency may not be so expedient for the Publick Welfare, as it would be agreeable to my own Inclinations.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I thank you for your readiness to Support me in the present Juncture of Affairs, and for the Supplies</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="367"/>
<HI>which you have given me, and do promise you, that they shall be employ'd for the Ʋses to which you de∣sign'd them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I shall order such faithful Accounts to be laid before you the next Session, as will make it appear, there was no other View in asking any particular Supply, than to prevent a much greater Expence, which the Nation must have unavoidably incurred without it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I must recommend to you, as I did at the Beginning of the Session, to take all proper Methods for Re∣ducing the Publick Debts, with a just Regard to Par∣liamentary Credit.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>The Year being so far advanced, I hope you will go through the Publick Business with all possible Dis∣patch and Ʋnanimity, it being my Intention to meet you early the next Winter, that the Sitting of Par∣liament may be brought into the more usual and con∣venient Season.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Addresses and Answers which follow'd this Speech, being Matters of meer Form, I omit as not material to the Story, and to be found in the Votes of this Session.</P>
<P>At the same Time the Parliament was sitting here, the General Assembly was conven'd in <HI>Scotland;</HI> but when I have noted, that the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> was Commissioner, that he went down, deliver'd the King's Letter, open'd the Assembly the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>May</HI> with a Speech, received an Answer the <HI>4th</HI> to the King, and closed the Assembly with another Speech the <HI>16th:</HI> I say, when this is said, I think every thing of Moment which pass'd there is sufficiently mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="368"/>
In the mean Time, a new Broil agitated the House of Commons for some Days, and raised great Heats among the Members; this related to General <HI>Cado∣gan,</HI> about the Expence of bringing over the 6000 Men, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> lent his Majesty against the Rebellion, the Transporting these Men, it seems, cost the Government <HI>11000l.</HI> whereas they were ship'd back again for less than a <HI>4th</HI> Part of the Mo∣ney: This Question was argued warmly, and the extravagant Sum was accounted for, only by the Haste and Hurry of getting the Men over, the length of their March, and the difficulty of getting Ships to Transport them at so short a Warning: However, it was pass'd over, and the Committee coming to no Resolution, the Speaker resumed the Chair, so that it was not so much as mention'd in the Votes, or taken Notice of, that any such thing had been debated in the House.</P>
<P>The House had now little Business before them but that of the Money, and as the Payment of the Publick Debts was the great Thing in View, so the Manner of doing it for this Year, is best understood by the Proposals negotiated, as I had observ'd be∣fore, by the <HI>Bank</HI> and <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, and by which the Government was enabled to have answer'd the Demands of the Proprietors of the Funds, whose Interest was to be reduced, if they had come for their Money. These Proposals therefore, being with a very little Variation accepted and enacted, it is ve∣ry proper to record them here, that they may be of use to those Readers, who cannot on all Occasions have Recourse to the Acts themselves: The Propo∣sals are as follow, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>

The Proposals were acceptable enough to the House, except that of the Term of Years to be ad∣ded to the Company, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the giving Five Years Notice for the Redeeming the Loan, which the House rejected after some very warm Debates, particularly about the latter. However, in the End, the Communities, as they were called, receded from the Demands of Time, leaving it to the Par∣liament, who referred the adding Time, as before, to another Session, and reduced the Time for No∣tice of Redemption to one Year; and so this great Affair pass'd, and the Two Companies engag'd to advance, the <HI>Bank</HI> Two Millions and an Half, and the <HI>South Sea</HI> Company Two Millions, if call'd for; and this Proposal was pass'd into a Law.</P>
<P>The Acts being pass'd upon these Proposals, the Government was now furnished to pay all Men their Principal Money if they had demanded it; and there∣fore the Lords of the Treasury set the Thing imme∣diately on Foot, in order to make the Experiment whether the Publick Credit was able to support the Loans, tho' with an Abatement of Interest, and whether the People would come for their Money or no.</P>

<P>The Right Honourable the Lords <Q>“Commissio∣ners of his Majesty's Treasury give Notice, that they have required the Paymasters and Comp∣trollers of the Orders in the Lotteries now sub∣scribing for Annuities, their Deputies and Clerks, to give constant and diligent Attendance in their Offices daily <HI>(Sundays</HI> excepted) from Eight in the Morning to One, and from Three to Six in the Afternoon, to direct and pay, with the utmost Expedition, all Arrears of Interest on the Orders in every of the said Lotteries, to and for the Quarter ended at <HI>Midsummer</HI> last 1717, Money sufficient being put by their Lordships into the Hands of the respective Paymasters of the said” Lottery Orders for that Purpose.</Q></P>
<P>This Publication being made, and the Books opened, it was soon seen which way the Stream would run; for as in the first Place, there were few or none that desired to take their Money, so if there had been ever so many, there were People al∣ways ready, and Money lodg'd by private Hands with the Clerks, to buy the Interest of any that de∣sired to part with it, and to be entred in their stead; so that if the Proprietors of all those Lottery Orders had demanded their Money, it was plain, that the Government needed not to have call'd upon
<PB N="113" REF="378"/>
the <HI>Bank</HI> or <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company for one Farthing, and thus at the Time of the Writing these Sheets, we find, the Books being closed, there is but <HI>471 l. 4 s. 0 d.</HI> demanded in Money, all the rest being subscrib'd to continue upon the same Security at <HI>5 l. per Cent.</HI> Interest, the Sum amounting to <HI>Nine Mil∣lions, Two Hundred and Thirty Thousand, Eight Hundred and Seventy Three Pounds, Eighteen Shil∣lings and Four Pence;</HI> so that, <HI>we say,</HI> 'tis evident, the <HI>Government</HI> will not have occasion on this <HI>Ac∣count</HI> for one Penny of that Money which the said <HI>Communities</HI> are to furnish.</P>
<P>I am now coming to the close of the Session, which was chiefly taken up with Disputes between the two Houses, in their judicial Affairs, and parti∣cularly the famous Case in Parliament of the Earl of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>That truly great Man had been now under Con∣finement almost two Years, and had this Session been let slip, and was likely enough to lie there ano∣ther Year; whether uneasy at the Length of his Confinement, or with his usual Penetration, percei∣ving the critical Juncture of his Deliverance to be before him; I say, whether of these I do not en∣quire: But the Earl, with the same calm Courage with which he put himself into the Hands of the Parliament at first, when he might, had he doubted his Innocence, or their Justice, have secur'd himself: I say, with the same calm Courage he now resol∣ved to Court his Danger, and casting the Die for Life or Death, Petitions the House to have his Case taken into Consideration: I cannot omit some Lines which I have met with, as Part of a Descrip∣tion of his Case on this Occasion, and which, I think, do but Justice to the inimitable Resolution and Bravery of Mind with which he put himself
<PB N="114" REF="379"/>
into the Hands of publick Justice, when it must be own'd, the Stream of popular Feud ran so high, that it was enough, if possible, to terrifie even In∣nocence it self: The Lines were these.</P>
<Q><L>Great Heart who taught thee thus unmov'd to Die,</L>
<L>To Rate thy Blood to Law, thy Fame so high:</L>
<L>Did the least Spot upon thy Soul appear?</L>
<L>It could not be: Such Courage speaks thee clear.</L>
<L>For Guilt must ha betray'd it self by Fear.</L></Q>
<P>And as I am mentioning the Courage of the Earl's Surrender, as an Argument of his Innocence, so without trespassing upon the Impartiality of an Hi∣storian, I must in Justice say, that never more Ho∣nour was done to the Justice of the House of Peers, by any Man that ever I read of in History, than was done by this noble Person, in casting himself into their Hands so boldly, so chearfully depending up∣on their Justice, Honour and impartial Proceedings; and this when his Life was in the most manifest Ha∣zard, as well from both the Number as the Rage of his Enemies: And when this Temper, <HI>or rather want Temper,</HI> discover'd so evidently a Thirst after his Ruin; when his Friends dispair'd for him, and lay at him Night and Day, with the Exhortations of the fainter hearted Apostle, <HI>Master, save thy self;</HI> when others more fam'd for Courage durst not stand it, and when the Voice of Numbers were evidently against him.</P>
<P>It will not be pretended that he was ignorant how easily the Constitution itself sometimes gives way to popular Clamours, how often Innocence is run down by Crowd, and the clearest Truth smo∣ther'd with the Breath of a Majority.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="380"/>
He was not ignorant how many there were who pursued him with personal Pique, how numerous his Enemies were, or how powerful even among the P—t.</P>
<P>He knew indeed, that his Cause depended upon the strict Appeal he made to the Laws of his Coun∣try; but he was not ignorant how frequently Consti∣tutions are violated, by straining the Constructions both of Law and of Offences, especially when the Humour of the Times condemns, or a Man falls a Sacrifice to popular Resentment.</P>
<P>But knowing what Justice would demand of the House of Peers, and believing they would always act as became their Dignity, and as Honour and un∣byass'd Justice directed them, he cast his Life into their Hands, honour'd them with believing they were what they ought to be, and that they would never taint their Blood with the unbecoming Cruelty of dipping their Hands in his; unless the Law un∣constrain'd, and Evidence unconfuted, should con∣vince them of his Guilt, which he was well assur'd could not be.</P>
<P>In this, I say, he put the greatest Honour upon the Peers that it was possible for any Man to do; and I persuade my self it will be granted, that as the History of the past Ages can scarce shew a Pre∣cedent, so it may be long enough before any of his Enemies who boast of their new Advancements to a Rank which they know not how to deserve, will ever give either a like Testimony of Innocence, or the like Veneration for the Persons and Honour of the British Nobility.</P>
<P>But I return to the History. It was the <HI>22d</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> the Earl caused a Petition to be presented to the House of Lords, sign'd by his Name, setting forth, <HI>That he had been long confin'd, upon an <HI>Im∣peachment</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="381"/>
brought up against him to their Lordships House, by the Commons of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for</HI> High-Treason, <HI>and other</HI> High Crimes <HI>and</HI> Misdemeanours; <HI>submitting his Case to their Lordships Consideration, and praying that his Imprisonment might not be in∣definite.</HI></P>
<P>This Petition was something surprizing, and was taken by some to be a Calling upon the House to bring him to Tryal, and for some time was resented as such, at least in the House of Com∣mons; however, the Lords, who acted with the utmost Calmness and Sedateness, proceeded without taking it by any such Handle, and heard with Pa∣tience whatever the Earl's Friends had to alledge in his Favour, and several long Speeches were made upon the Niceties and Scruples which offer'd on one side as well as on the other; particularly, some of the Lords insisted in his behalf, that the Im∣peachment was <HI>ipfo facto</HI> destroy'd and determin'd, seeing he was not brought to Tryal the same Sessi∣ons in which he was Impeached; and that the Prorogation was an actual <HI>Supersedeas</HI> to the whole Proceedings; this was warmly Debated, and the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> insisted so strenuously upon it, that he demanded Leave to enter his Protestation a∣gainst the Vote pass'd on the other side: A strange Change in this noble Person, from the Temper which he shew'd at the Time of the Impeachment!</P>
<P>However, this being over-rul'd or rejected, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> mov'd to appoint a Day for the Earl's Tryal, which after some Debates, and appointing a Committee to search Precedents, was fix'd and appointed; and 'tis to be observed here, that the appointing a Day for the Tryal, did not occasion so long a Debate, as the shortening the Day; and it was something wonderful to find the Earl's
<PB N="117" REF="382"/>
Friends pressing the House to appoint a short Day; and the Governments Friends, if we may be allow∣ed that Distinction, pleading for Time; as if the Earl was in a greater Readiness or Forwardness to make his Defence, than the <HI>Commons</HI> were in to make good their Charge.</P>
<P>But so it was, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who made the Motion, press'd earnestly for a short Day, and nam'd the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> to be the Day of Tryal; this caused several Speeches and Debates, needless to be repeated here. However, on a Divi∣sion, it was carried for a Week longer, 85 Voices against 44, and the <HI>13th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> was fix'd for the Earl's Tryal.</P>
<P>As these Things caused long Debates in the <HI>House of Lords,</HI> so the Message sent to the <HI>Commens,</HI> to acquaint them that the <HI>Lords</HI> had appointed the <HI>13th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> for the Tryal, caused long Debates among them: The <HI>Commons</HI> saw the Face of their Affairs a little changed; some People, who were active and vigorous in this Prosecution when it was first begun, and upon whom the House might be said, in some measure, to depend for the carrying it on, seem'd to look coldly upon the Matter, and to de∣cline the Work, or at least, to have less of that Con∣fidence which the House usually shew'd them, and was due to them before. This caused a Vote in the House, to appoint a Committee to enquire into the State of the Impeachments at that time depending before the House.</P>
<P>This Committe found, upon their Enquiry, that the Secret Committee had suffered some Dislocati∣on of Members since the last Session, <HI>viz.</HI> several Members were called up from it to the House of Peers, as the Lord <HI>Onslow,</HI> the Lord <HI>Coningshy,</HI> and others; and some other Members seemed, as is said,
<PB N="118" REF="383"/>
to be gone off, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that the first Thing the New Committee for Enquiry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> did, was to move the House that more Members might be added to the Committee, and the House was mov'd accordingly; upon which <HI>Lawrence Carter,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Sir <HI>William Thompson,</HI> Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> Ser∣jeant <HI>Birch,</HI> and Serjeant <HI>Pingelly,</HI> were added to the Secret Committee; and now they acted open∣ly, dropt Mr. <HI>Walpole</HI> out of the Chair, for he was Chairman of the former Committee, whereas now they made Mr. <HI>Lawr. Carter,</HI> Member for the Town of <HI>Leicester,</HI> Chairman, and then four more were added to the Committee, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> Secretary of State, Mr. <HI>James Craggs</HI> Secretary at War, Mr. Serjeant <HI>Mead,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jessop;</HI> and at another time after that Mr. <HI>Nicholas Lechmere,</HI> who was just then rechosen into the House, after his being made Chancellor of the Duchy of <HI>Lancaster.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus gotten all the eminent Lawyers of the House to be nam'd of the Committee, they fell immediately to the Business, <HI>viz.</HI> preparing to make good the Articles of Impeachment, in case the House should agree to proceed to the Tryal; but all this while they left the World in suspense as to their Resolution, even till the Day before the Day ap∣pointed for Tryal, when the <HI>Commons</HI> sent a Mes∣sage to the <HI>Lords,</HI> to demand longer Time for their Preparations. This was, according to a Report made to them by the Committee, in the Terms fol∣lowing, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>That the Committee had met several Times, and made some Progress in the Matters to them referr'd; but that the Prosecution of the said Impeachment ha∣ving been interrupted for so many Months, by the Intervention of many weighty and urgent Affairs, which</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="384"/>
<HI>more nearly and immediately concern'd the Welfare, Defence, and Security of the Kingdom; it was be∣come absolutely necessary for those who should be ap∣pointed to manage the said Impeachment, to review, and carefully peruse all the Treaties, Records, Let∣ters, and other Papers proper and necessary for sup∣porting this Prosecution; which being very volumi∣nous, it would be impossible, within the Time ap∣pointed for the Tryal, to adjust and apply the pro∣per Evidence to the several Articles.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This Message being sent to the <HI>Lords,</HI> they gran∣ted Time to the <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> upon which, the <HI>Commons</HI> seriously apply'd themselves to prepare for the Tryal; and here it was to be observ'd, that the <HI>Earl's Party,</HI> (as they were called) in the House of <HI>Peers,</HI> argued and insisted some time upon the first Day, alledging, that the <HI>Lords</HI> having fix'd a peremptory Day for the Tryal, they ought not to put it off, or allow any farther Day: What the Mystery of their hurrying on the Tryal so warmly was, was not seen till afterwards; but the Question being put, it was carry'd for a longer Time, as above.</P>
<P>And now the <HI>Commons</HI> began to let it be seen, that they resolv'd to go on with the Tryal; and accor∣dingly voted Managers for carrying it on: These were the whole Committee of Secrecy, and no other excepting such as they then added to the Committee; then they resolv'd, that the House would be present at the Tryal, as a Committee of the whole House, and then voted the usual Method for their going, no sitting at, and coming from the Tryal.</P>
<P>The <HI>24th</HI> of <HI>June</HI> the Tryal began: The Ac∣counts of it, which were published by Authority, are my best Guides in stating the whole Affair, which
<PB N="120" REF="385"/>
however long, requires to be recorded by my Pen, that pretends to write the History of those Times: I shall however contract it within as narrow Com∣pass as Justice on both Sides will admit.</P>
<P>The Day being come for the Tryal, and the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> Prisoner, being brought up from the <HI>Tower,</HI> the Lords about <HI>Eleven</HI> a Clock mov'd from their House Two by Two in great State, and with all the usual Formalities, too long to require a Repe∣tition in our <HI>Annals.</HI> The Lord <HI>Cowper,</HI> who was appointed Lord High-Steward for the Day, going also in great State, with the Judges, and with all his proper Officers, into <HI>Westminster-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Commons, according to the Orders above, appeared in the Place assigned for them, the Managers being in a Place separated for them.</P>
<P>His Majesty was also in the Place appointed for the Royal Family, with the Prince and Princess of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Assembly being plac'd, the Lord High-Steward constituted the Court, by causing his Com∣mission to be read, receiving the White Staff, and ascending some Steps to his Seat of Justice; and immediately Proclamation was made, to order the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower</HI> to bring the Prisoner to the Bar, which was done: The Earl coming up to the Bar, kneeled down, and continued kneeling till the Lord High-Steward told him he might rise; he be∣hav'd Grave and Decent, yet Chearful and not De∣jected, and when he rose up from his Knees, bowed with Tokens of Respect to the Lord High-Steward, and to the Peers, which Civility was re∣turned with great Courtesie by them all.</P>
<P>These Matters of Ceremony being over, the Ar∣ticles of Impeachment were read, the Earl's An∣swer,
<PB N="121" REF="386"/>
and the Replication of the <HI>Cammons,</HI> which are too long to enter upon here.</P>
<P>After the Reading these Things, the Lord <HI>High-Steward</HI> addressing himself to the Earl Prisoner, spoke as follows:</P>
<P><Q>“<HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> and Earl <HI>Mortimer,</HI> it has been usual, before the <HI>Commons</HI> proceed, to say something from this Place to Persons in your Lordship's present Condition; partly by way of Exhortation to a reasonable Confidence in the great Honour, Justice, Wisdom, Integrity and Candour of their Judges, their Peers, the House of Lords in Parliament assembled; and partly by way of Direction, to assist them in their Behavi∣our and Conduct during the Course of their” Tryal.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But considering the many great Offices your Lordship has born in the State, your long Expe∣rience and known Learning in all Parliamentary Proceedings, I cannot but think it would seem im∣proper for me to be speaking to your Lordship” in that manner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Wherefore I proceed barely to acquaint your Lordship and others whom it may çoncern, with such Orders as the Lords have made, which 'tis fit should be taken Notice of thus early in this” Tryal.</Q></P>
<P N="1"><Q>“1. Your Lordship, and all other Persons who have occasion to speak to this Court, must ad∣dress their Speech to the Lords in general, and” not to any Lord in particular.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>“2. Your Lordship's Council may be present at the Bar, in order to be heard to any Point or Matter of Law, if such shall arise on either of the Articles for High-Treason; and that you may
<PB N="122" REF="387"/>
make your full Defence by Council, if you think fit, on the Articles for High-Crimes and Misde∣meanours,” as well on Matters of Fact as of Law.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>“3. That your Witnesses are to be examin'd on Oath, as well to the Articles for High-Treason, as” those for High Crimes and Misdemeanours.</Q></P>
<P>Then the Lord High-Steward, with the Lords Leave, went down, and having seated him∣self by the Table, told the Gentlemen of the House of Commons, That they might now proceed: Upon which Mr. <HI>Stanhope</HI> said, <HI>My Lords, the Distance of the Lord High-Steward from this Place, may have been the Occasion, that We have mistaken some∣thing that fell from thence; We do therefore desire to avoid all Mistakes, (and I believe We might be mistaken) for we understood by my Lord High-Stew∣ard, that</HI> Council should be allowed the Prisoner at the Bar, as well to the Defence of the High-Treason, as to the High Crimes and Misdemea∣nours: <HI>It is possible we misapprehend his Lordship, but we hope his Lordship will be pleased to explain it to Us.</HI> <Q>Hereupon the Lord High-Steward said, “To prevent Mistakes, I repeat what I said, That <HI>Council</HI> for the Lord (the Prisoner at the Bar) may be present at the Bar, in order to be heard to any Matter or Point of Law (if any such shall arise) relating to the <HI>High-Treason,</HI> and likewise to make that Lord's Defence on the Articles of Impeachment of High Crimes and Misde∣meanours, as well in <HI>Matters of Fact,</HI> as <HI>Matters</HI>” <HI>of Law.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Hereupon the <HI>Managers</HI> began; Mr. <HI>Hampden</HI> being the first, who open'd the Case in a long Speech.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="388"/>
After Mr. <HI>Hampden</HI>'s Speech, Sir <HI>Joseph Jekyl</HI> was going on, when the Lord <HI>Harcourt</HI> made a Mo∣tion to adjourn to the House of Lords, where, up∣on a long Debate, it was resolv'd, not to admit the <HI>Commons</HI> to proceed in making good the Articles for High Crimes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till Judgment be first given upon the Articles for High-Treason.</P>
<P>This being declared to the <HI>Managers</HI> at the <HI>Lords</HI> return to the Hall, the <HI>Managers</HI> reply'd: <HI>That they conceived it to be so much the undoubted Right of the</HI> Commons <HI>to proceed in their own Method, in Maintenance of the Articles exhibited by them, and did apprehend that this Resolution of their Lord∣ships might be of so fatal Consequence to the Rights and Privileges of all the</HI> Commons <HI>of</HI> Great-Bri∣tain, <HI>that they could not take upon them to proceed any farther, without resorting to the</HI> House of Com∣mons <HI>for their Direction therein.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Proceeding, Conferences, searching Precedents, and the like Methods of managing such Disputes, took up some Days, and in particular, on the <HI>27th,</HI> the <HI>Commons</HI> at a Conference, deliver'd the following Paper to the <HI>Lords,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Commons <HI>having taken into their Conside∣ration your Lordships Resolution communicated to their Managers, relating to the Proceedings on the Tryal of</HI> Robert <HI>Earl of</HI> Oxford <HI>and Earl</HI> Morti∣mer, <HI>and being desirous, as far as in them lies, to maintain a good Correspondence with your Lordships, have desired this Conference, and have commanded us to acquaint your Lordships, That they conceive it to be the undoubted Right of the</HI> Commons, <HI>to impeach a Peer, either for High-Treason, or for High Crimes and Misdemeanours, or, if they see</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="389"/>
<HI>occasion, to mix both the one and the other in the same Accusation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Impeachment preferr'd against</HI> Robert <HI>Earl of</HI> Oxford <HI>and Earl</HI> Mortimer <HI>is one continued Ac∣cusation, consisting of High Crimes and Misdemea∣nours, and also of Charges of High-Treason. The Facts on which the Articles preceding those of High-Treason are grounded, are laid together in order of Time, and follow one another successively, in the Manner they were committed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As the</HI> Commons <HI>thought this the most natural Method for exhibiting the several Articles against the said Earl, they were of Opinion, That they should proceed in the Proof of these several Facts after the same Method, since it is manifest, that in laying open the Course of such a wicked Admini∣stration, the preceding Parts of it give Light to those which follow; and that, the Proof of those of High-Treason.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Your Lordships received these several Articles of Impeachment, without making any Exception a∣gainst the Form in which they were exhibited. The said Earl made his Answer to them in the same Or∣der, and has no where insisted to be Try'd in any other Method; so that the</HI> Commons <HI>are surpriz'd to find a stop put to their Prosecution by an Ob∣jection which has never been started by the said Earl, and which your Lordships had given them so little Reason to expect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To this must be added, That as the</HI> Commons <HI>only are Masters of the Evidence, and as upon that Ac∣count they are best able to determine, what to Charge first, and what next; so they are most proper to determine in what Method to proceed for the Advan∣tage of the Prosecution, in the Event of which all</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="390"/>
<HI>the</HI> Commons <HI>of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>are so highly concern'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To which they farther add, That they see no Rea∣son but that your Lordships may as well invert the whole Order of the Articles, as prescribe to the</HI> Commons <HI>those particular Articles on which they are first to proceed, which will necessarily produce such a Confusion, both in the Facts and Evidence, as is by no means consistent with that Clearness and Perspicuity in which the</HI> Commons <HI>think this Affair ought to appear.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Commons, <HI>upon examining Precedents, do find divers Precedents of Impeachments for High-Treason, and other High Crimes and Misdemea∣nours in the same Accusation; and do not find that the</HI> Lords <HI>ever objected to such Proceeding, or e∣ver gave Judgment upon any particular Article of an Impeachment before the</HI> Commons <HI>had gone through, and concluded their Evidence upon all the Articles, or so many of them as they thought fit; and the</HI> Commons <HI>are at a loss to conceive what Argu∣ments or Precedents can be brought to support the Resolution of your Lordships, to give Judgment upon one part of the same Accusation, reserving the other part for a subsequent Tryal, as they are to know what your Lordships mean by admitting the</HI> Commons <HI>to proceed upon the Articles of High-Crimes and Misdemeanours, after the Judgment is given upon the Articles for High Treason, supposing the Judgment proper for High-Treason should be gi∣ven against the said Earl.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For these Reasons, the</HI> Commons <HI>assert it as their undoubted Right to proceed on the Tryal of</HI> Robert <HI>Earl of</HI> Oxford <HI>and Earl</HI> Mortimer, <HI>after the Method in which their Managers were proceeding, when interrupted by your Lordships Resolution.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="391"/>
These Heads being Debated in the <HI>House of Lords,</HI> brought it to the Question a second Time, Whether the <HI>Commons</HI> should be admitted to pro∣ceed, or whether the House should insist, and it was carry'd to <HI>insist on their former Resolution;</HI> and they also ordered a Paper of Reasons in Main∣tenance of their Resolution to be drawn up and de∣livered to the <HI>Commons</HI> at another Conference: Which Reasons are as follow.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Their Lordships, in order to preserve a good Cor∣respondence with the</HI> House of Commons, <HI>(which they shall always endeavour to do as far as lies in their Power) have desired this Conference upon the subject Matter of the last Conference, and have di∣rected us to acquaint you, That their</HI> Lordships <HI>judge it a Right inherent in every Court of Justice, to or∣der and direct such Methods of Proceedings as such Court shall think fit to be observed in all Causes depending before them, which can have no Influence to the Prejudice of Justice; and where such Methods of Proceedings are not otherwise settled by any posi∣tive Rule. The Power of Judicature on all Im∣peachments being a Right unquestionably inherent in their Lordships, and it not being determined by any positive Rule, whether the</HI> House of Commons <HI>may proceed to make good the several Articles exhibited for Misdemeanours, in such Order as they shall think fit, before they proceed to make good the Articles ex∣hibited for High-Treason; and there being no Pre∣cedent where the</HI> Commons, <HI>upon the Tryal of any such Impeachment, attempted to proceed in the first Place, to make good any of the Articles contain'd in such Impeachment for High Crimes and Misdemea∣nours; their</HI> Lordships <HI>considering the Nature of the Impeachment now depending before them, and the <HI>Me∣thod</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="392"/>
wherein the Managers for the</HI> House of Com∣mons <HI>were beginning to proceed upon the Tryal, to make good the first Article thereof, which is a Charge for High Crimes and Misdemeanours only; and also considering, the very different Methods of Proceed∣ing on an Impeachment of a Peer for High-Treason, as well before, as upon the Tryal thereof, and the Circumstances attending such a Tryal, thought them∣selves obliged to come to the Resolution communicated to the</HI> Commons <HI>on the</HI> 24th <HI>Instant, as well for the doing Justice in the Case depending before them, as for the preventing a new President to be made on this Tryal; in Consequence whereof, a new and un∣justifiable Form of Proceeding against a Peer upon an Impeachment for High Treason and High Crimes might be introduced at his Tryal upon those Articles in which he is charged for High Crimes and Misdemeanours only, to the Prejudice of the Peer∣age of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>in all Time to come,</HI> viz. <HI>The Trying a Peer on Articles for High Crimes and Mis∣demeanours without the Bar, the detaining in Custo∣dy a Peer so accused, and repeated Commitments of him to the</HI> Tower, <HI>during the Time of such Tryal, and subjecting a Peer to as ignominious Circumstan∣ces on his Tryal, on Articles for Misdemeanours, as if he was then on his Tryal on Articles for High-Treason: Whereas a Peer on his Tryal on Articles for Misdemeanours only, ought not to be deprived of his Liberty, nor sequestred from Parliament; and is entitled to the Privilege of sitting within the Bar during the whole Time of his Tryal: In all which Particulars, the known Rule of Pro∣ceedings in such Cases may be evaded, should a Peer be brought to his Tryal on several Ar∣ticles exhibited against him on High Crimes and Misdemeanours, and for High Treason mixed <HI>to∣gether,</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="393"/>
and the</HI> Commons <HI>be admitted to pro∣ceed in order to make good the Articles for High Crimes and Misdemeanours before Judgment be given upon the Articles for High-Treason. Their</HI> Lordships <HI>have fully considered the Matters offered to them by the</HI> House of Commons <HI>at the last Conference relating to the Proceedings against</HI> Robert <HI>Earl of</HI> Oxford <HI>and Earl</HI> Mortimer; <HI>and their</HI> Lordships <HI>are fully satisfied, That the Resolution they have taken and communicated to the</HI> Commons <HI>on the</HI> 24th <HI>Instant, is just and reasonable; and that the</HI> House of Commons <HI>are not put under any real Inconvenience thereby, in carrying on their present Prosecution. Their</HI> Lordships <HI>have commanded us to let you know, That they do insist on their said Resolution,</HI> viz. <HI>That the</HI> Commons <HI>be not admitted to proceed in order to make good the Articles against</HI> Robert <HI>Earl of</HI> Oxford <HI>and Earl</HI> Mortimer <HI>for High Crimes and Misdemeanours, till Judgment be first given upon the Articles for High-Treason.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Thus far the Two Houses debated Things with some Calmness, but they grew warmer the next Day, when the <HI>Commons</HI> having consider'd the Rea∣sons above, sent a Message to the <HI>Lords</HI> to desire a free Conference, and the <HI>Lords</HI> refused it; and now the Party of the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> began to see his Deliverance at hand; for the <HI>Lords</HI> refusing to grant the <HI>Commons</HI> a free Conference, set the Two Houses into a new Dispute, and they were going on to great Heights; the <HI>Commons</HI> desiring a Conference of the <HI>Lords</HI> upon this Subject, they gave in a Paper there:</P>
<PB N="129" REF="394"/>
<Q><P><HI>The</HI> Commons <HI>having taken into Consideration your</HI> Lordships <HI>Message,</HI> viz. That your <HI>Lordships</HI> did not think fit to give a free Conference on the subject Matter of the last Conference, as was de∣sired by the <HI>Commons: And they being still desirous, to the utmost of their Power, to preserve a good Cor∣respondence with your</HI> Lordships, <HI>have asked this Conference; and have commanded us to acquaint your</HI> Lordships, <HI>That they are very much surprizd to find your</HI> Lordships <HI>deny a free Conference, after your</HI> Lordships <HI>have already agreed to a Conference desired by the</HI> Commons <HI>on the same subject Matter, and after your</HI> Lordships <HI>have on your Parts also desired a Conference upon the same Subject. That free Conferences are the most ancient and establish∣ed Methods for adjusting the Differences that have at any time arisen between the Two Houses, and, as the</HI> Commons <HI>conceive, is the only Method to preserve a good Correspondence between them on such Occasions, which, at this Time, is of the highest Importance; because a Misunderstanding on this Ac∣count, would tend to defeat the Tryal of the Im∣peachment of the</HI> Commons. <HI>That the</HI> Commons <HI>conceive clearly, that the subject Matter of the last Conference is not a</HI> Point of Judicature, <HI>but a Point</HI> relating only to the Prosecution <HI>of the</HI> Commons, <HI>it having arisen before any Matter of Judgment had come before your</HI> Lordships <HI>upon the Tryal. For which Reasons the</HI> Commons <HI>conceive, that your</HI> Lordships <HI>ought not to have denied them a free Conference upon the subject Matter of the last Con∣ference.</HI></P></Q>
<P>These Things were read and considered, but the <HI>Lords</HI> being clear in it, that the <HI>Commons</HI> were in the Wrong, resolv'd to insist upon it, that they
<PB N="130" REF="395"/>
ought not to grant them a free Conference upon this Subject; and having put the Question again in their House, it pass'd, not to grant a free Confe∣rence, which was signified to the <HI>Commons;</HI> as also that the <HI>Lords</HI> would presently proceed farther on the Tryal of the Earl.</P>
<P>The <HI>Commons</HI> took no notice of this Message at all, nay, some mov'd, as we were told, not to re∣ceive it. However, seeing the <HI>Lords</HI> were resolv'd to proceed, the House adjourn'd; some suggested, that this Adjournment was ordered, that they might not receive any more Messages about it, or be sent to from the Hall to appear at the Tryal.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>House of Lords</HI> proceeded in the Formalities of Judicature; they went down to the Hall, took their Places in Judgment, ordered the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower</HI> to bring the Earl to the Bar, and made Proclamation in these Words: <Q>“Whereas <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> and Earl <HI>Morti∣mer,</HI> stands Impeach'd of High Treason and other High Crimes and Misdemeanours, by the <HI>House of Commons,</HI> in the Name of themselves and of all the <HI>Commons</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> all Persons concern'd are to take Notice, that he now stands upon his Tryal, and they may now come forth in” order to make good their Charge.</Q></P>
<P>After this, the Court sat perfectly silent, and looking upon one another as if expecting the <HI>Com∣mons</HI> should appear, this Silence held about a quar∣ter of an Hour, when the <HI>Lords</HI> adjourn'd to their House; where the Question was put, that the Earl should be acquitted, and it pass'd in the Affirmative; and then the Method of giving Judgment was dis∣cuss'd, the very Words prescribed, and Directions given to the Lord <HI>High-Steward</HI> concerning the far∣ther Proceedings in the Hall.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="396"/>
The House was then again adjourned into <HI>West∣minster-Hall,</HI> and being there resumed,</P>

<P>My Lords, the Clerk acquaints me, that, for want of Light in the Passage, he could not take an exact List of your Lordships; I therefore desire that he may now take a List of the Lords present.</P>

<P>My Lords, I shall now state the Question, upon which your Lordships are to give your Votes; it is this, That <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> and Earl <HI>Mortimer,</HI> be acquitted of the Articles of Impeachment exhibited against him by the House of Commons, for High Treason, and other High Crimes and Misdemeanours, and of all Things therein contained, and that the said Impeachment be dismissed.</P>

<P>It is Considered, Ordered and Adjudged by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assem∣bled, that <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> and Earl <HI>Mortimer</HI> shall be, and is hereby acquitted of the Articles of Impeachment exhibited against him by the House of Commons for High-Treason, and other High Crimes and Misdemeanours, and of all Things therein con∣tain'd, and that the said Impeachment shall be, and is hereby dismissed.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Chancellor.</SPEAKER>
<P>This House is adjourn'd to the Chamber of Parliament.</P>
</SP>
<P>Thus ended this great Affair, and the Earl's being immediately Discharg'd at the Bar, and paying his Respects to the Court, and to the Lords, and ha∣ving receiv'd the Compliments of his Friends, went away directly to his own House.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Commons</HI> did not rest here, but on the <HI>Wednesday</HI> after, reassuming the Debate men∣tioned above, and resolving to shew their Resent∣ment at this Proceeding, they, after a very close Debate, resolv'd, that an Address should be presen∣ted to his Majesty, to except the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> out of the <HI>Act of Grace,</HI> which was intended to be brought into the House.</P>
<P>The Parliament drew now towards a Recess of their Session, and little Business seem'd to lie before them, except such Bills as were ready for the Royal Assent; when on the <HI>26th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Sun∣derland,</HI> by his Majesty's Order, deliver'd into the House of Lords, the (so long expected) Act of Grace.</P>
<P>It was immediately ordered to be read, and had accordingly all the formal Reading as the Thing re∣quir'd, and was pass'd <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI> and sent down to the House of Commons, where it was likewise read and pass'd without any Amendment, and return'd to the Lords the same Afternoon, when
<PB N="136" REF="401"/>
in the Evening the King came to the House, and put an end to the Session with the following Speech.</P>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I <HI>Cannot put an End to this Session, witbout expres∣sing my Thanks to you, for the Dispatch you have given to the Publick Business, and declaring the Sa∣tisfaction I promise my Self in Meeting you again early the next Winter, with the same good Disposi∣tions for the Service of your Country. The Mea∣sures we have taken in this Parliament, have, by the Blessing of Almighty God, effectually defeated all the Attempts of our Enemies, both at Home and Abroad; and, as the Principles on which those Mea∣sures are founded, are equally conducive to the Sup∣porting the just Rights of the Crown, and the Liber∣ties of the People, I shall always persevere in them my self, and distinguish those who adhere to them with the same Steadiness and Resolution.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I thank you, in the most affectionate Manner, for the Supplies you have granted me, and for that Con∣stancy and Zeal which you have shewn in Reducing our National Debts, notwithstanding the many Inci∣dents and Obstructions you have met with in the car∣rying on of that great Work. As you have furnish∣ed me with the Means of disappointing any Designs of a Foreign Enemy against these my Kingdoms, so I cannot but ascribe, in a great Measure, the happy Prospect of our Affairs Abroad, to that Publick Spirit which has appeared in your Proceedings; and has convinc'd the World, that no Insinuations or Ar∣tifices can divert you from your Duty to your <HI>Sove∣reign,</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="402"/>
and a disinterested Regard to your Fellow-Subjects.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>It is with great Pleasure that I see the Tranquil∣lity of the Nation so well establish'd, as to admit of an Act of Grace, which I have long desired a fit Op∣portunity to grant. I hope that such as shall, by this Means, be restored to the Enjoyment of Secu∣rity, and the Protection of those Laws against which they have offended, will have a due Sense of this my Indulgence, and give me the most acceptable Return they can possible make me, that of becoming Friends, instead of Enemies, to their Country.</HI></P></Q>
<P>And then the Lord Chancellor, by his Majesty's Command, said:</P>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>IT is His Majesty's Royal Will and Pleasure, That this Parliament be prorogued to</HI> Monday <HI>the Twelfth Day of</HI> August <HI>next, to be then here held; and this Parliament is accordingly prorogued to</HI> Monday <HI>the Twelfth Day of</HI> August <HI>next.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Parliament being now gone home, and the Act of Grace pass'd, the Prison Doors were every where open'd, and the Miserable obtain'd their Freedom in every Place; the Castle of <HI>Chester</HI> set open her Gates to upwards of 200, the Remains of the Rout at <HI>Preston;</HI> some of whom were reduced so low by the Misery of their Circumstances, that they were not able to stand on their Feet, or to take the Benefit of the Liberty that was offer'd.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="403"/>
At the Castles of <HI>Lancaster, Carlisle</HI> and <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> it was the like, only the Numbers were not so many.</P>
<P>As to the Persons excepted out of it, not reckon∣ing the ordinary Exceptions which are in all Pardons, they were only these.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Anno</HI> 1717-18.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Pacifick Entrance into this Year, promised fair for a happy Conclusion of it; and had it not been for Factions and Divisions at Court, the King had seen his Reign flourishing and calm, with all the Prospects of a settled Peace that his Heart could desire. The Judicial Proceedings against the Remains of the Rebel∣lion, were all closed by the Act of Grace, of which mention has been made: The Judges (says
<PB N="141" REF="406"/>
a certain Author,) now upon their Circuits, are em∣ployed rather in the pleasant Part of the Law, <HI>viz.</HI> of receiving the Plea of such who have laid hold of the King's general Pardon, than that more unsa∣tisfying Work of passing Sentence upon the Persons found Guilty.</P>
<P>The chief, if not the only Thing which was now upon the Stage on the Head of the late Troubles, was the Proceeding of the Commissioners for for∣feited Estates, <HI>so they were call'd,</HI> of whom menti∣on was made, in the preceding Part, and who had now separated themselves, to act in Vertue of their Trust, some in <HI>Scotland</HI> and some in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Those who sat in <HI>Scotland</HI> had met with great, and to them, insupportable Difficulties; not so much from the Proprietors of the Estates which were forfeited, for they were most of them out of the Capacity of offering any Obstruction to them, but the Opposition was from the Creditors of the At∣tainted Persons, who proceeding in the ordinary Course of Justice, and by the Authority of the Law, had actual Possession of the Estates in the Right of their Registred Bonds and Specialties, and refused to pay in the Rents which they received, into the Exchequer.</P>
<P>The Commissioners applied by a Petition, which is the usual Form, to the Lords of the Session, who are the Bench of Civil Judges in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Sum of the said Petition is concluded thus: <HI>May it therefore please your Lordships to recal the Factors, formerly granted by your Lordships, upon the said Forfeited Estates, leaving the Care thereof to the Commissioners of Inquiry, according to the Intent and Meaning of the Act of Parliament?</HI> Upon this Petition, their Lordships, after many Debates, gave it for the Creditors: So that the Commissioners had
<PB N="142" REF="407"/>
had no other Remedy but to lay it before the Parlia∣ment to be redress'd there; but it had not all the Success, <HI>even there,</HI> that was expected.</P>
<P>I know the more curious Readers will be very well pleased to know how the Creditors came to carry their Point so effectually against the Commis∣sioners in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and what were the Arguments which were so clear, and so convincing, that the whole Bench of Judges gave it against the Com∣missioners; for which Reason we have here given the Plea of the Creditors at large, as delivered into the Lords of the Session, by way of Answer to the Petition abovementioned: In which celebrated Piece the Reader will see the whole State of their Case, and upon what Foundation they obtained the Sentence of the SESSION, or Court of Civil Justice there, to keep the Possession even before the King himself.</P>
<P><HI>Answer on the Behalf of Claimants or Creditors to the said Bill or Petition.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Majesty's Advocate and Sollicitor having been pleased to give in a Petition to your Lordships, for removing the Factors lately appointed for the Management of certain forfeited Estates, now vested in His Majesty by a late Act of Parlia∣ment; which Factors were Authorized by your Lordships, upon the Application of the Creditors on the said Estates, according to the ordinary Form of our Procedure in such Cases; the said Creditors be∣ing justly apprehensive of the Prejudice that may arise to them in Case of any alteration in the Ma∣nagement, and in bringing of the Rents of the said Estates: Do humbly presume to lay before your Lordships the Reasons why they conceive that any
<PB N="143" REF="408"/>
Change in that Matter, will not only be highly prejudicial to them, but likewise of great Disad∣vantage to the Crown; and that the continuing the present Management by your Lordship's Factors, is no ways inconsistent with the late Act of Parlia∣ment appointing Commissioners to Enquire into the forfeited Estates, nor tends in any sort to incroach upon the Powers wherewith these Commissioners are vested.</P>
<P>The Creditors at the same time cannot but be under some Concern, that they are necessitate to state themselves in Opposition to a Demand made for the Interest of the Crown, to whose Justice and Favour they owe the Security that has been lately given them by Act of Parliament; but they hope, when they plead only in support of their just Debts in Consequence of that Act, they will not be understood to do any thing unbecoming that Duty and Gratitude they owe to his Majesty and the Par∣liament.</P>
<P>The Declaration for saving the Creditors Rights from any prejudice by the Forfeiture of their Deb∣tors, is contain'd in the Act of Parliament, <HI>Primo Georgij,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act for Encouraging all Su∣periors and Vassals,</HI> &amp;c. whereby it is provided, <Q>“That no Convictions or Attainder, upon the Ac∣count of the High-Treason or Treasons mentioned in the said Act, shall hurt or exclude the Right or Diligence of any Creditor remaining Peaceable and Dutiful, for security or payment of any true, just and lawful Debts, contracted before the Com∣mission” of any such Crimes.</Q></P>
<P>The Creditors do, with the greatest Cheerfulness, rely upon the publick Faith, and make no question but that all effectual Methods will be taken for sa∣tisfying their just Claim; and in order to constitute
<PB N="144" REF="409"/>
the same; and carry on such Diligence as the Law requires, for compleating and securing their several Rights, they did make Application to your Lord∣ships for Sequestrating the said Estates: That in the mean time, the Rents might be managed by your Lordships Direction, for the common Benefit of all Persons claiming Interests, as your Lordships are accustomed to do in all such Cases, where there are many competing for the same Subject; and this Method of Sequestration is a known Course of Di∣ligence by the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and what every Creditor has a Right to Demand, as a Common Se∣curity for all Parties concern'd: And the Nature of this Diligence by Sequestration, is an effectual Seiz∣ing the Possessions of the Estates, Goods, and Chat∣tels of the Debitors, for payment and satisfaction of their Debts, which therefore must continue till that End be obtained, otherwise it cannot be said, that the Diligence of Creditors are preserved to them according to the true Meaning and Intent of the above Clause, in the Act in Favour of the Creditors.</P>
<P>And here it may not be improper to observe to your Lordships, That according to the Laws and Constitutions of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was the private Right of Creditors upon Forfeited Estates as well as others, to have their Debtors Estates put under Se∣questration; for which End, they were always in use to apply to your Lordships, which never was looked upon as any Incroachment upon the Right of the Crown: And 'tis certain, that the Court of Session was the only Court competent to Cognosce and Determine in all such Matters. <Q>And by the <HI>18th</HI> Article of the Treaty of Union it is Provided, “That no Alteration be made in the Laws which concern private Rights, except for evident Utility
<PB N="145" REF="410"/>
”of the Subjects within <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> <Q>And farther by the <HI>19th</HI> Article, “That the Court of Session, after the Union, and notwithstanding there Remain in all time coming within <HI>Scotland,</HI> as it is now con∣stitute by the Laws of that Kingdom, and with the same Authorities and Privileges as before the” Union.</Q> From whence the Creditors hope they may justly infer, that if any Alteration, with Re∣gard to the private Right of the Subjects of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> had been intended, it would have been done in the most direct and positive Manner, and can very little be expected to be found in such Acts of Par∣liament as take notice of private Rights, in no other view, than in order to Ratify and Confirm them, and to declare they shall be in no manner Hurt or Excluded by any thing contained in the said Acts; which is the Case of the <HI>Act for Encou∣raging Superiors and Vassals,</HI> &amp;c. as likewise of the other <HI>Act appointing Commissioners to Enquire into the Estates of certain Traytors:</HI> <Q>Which last Act, lest it should be understood any ways to impair or diminish any of the Advantages or Privileges given to Superiors, Vassals, Creditors, or others by the soresaid first Act, contains a saving Clause, whereby it is Enacted, “That nothing in the same shall Ex∣tend, or be construed to Extend to Take away, Alter, or Diminish, any Right, Title, Benefit, or Advantage whatsoever, which any Superior, Vas∣sal, Landlord, or Tenant, or any Creditor or o∣thers continuing Peaceable, and in dutiful Alle∣giance to His Majesty, are, shall, or may be Enti∣tled unto, in vertue of the first cited Act, or to Repeal, Alter, or make Void, any Provisions, Matters, or Things in that Act contained; any thing in the Act (appointing Commissioners) to the” contrary notwithstanding.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="411"/>
And when the Tenor of this Clause is consider'd, with the Ampleness and Extensiveness of the Terms with which every Privilege given to Cre∣ditors by the first Act, is preserved in the second, there can be little Reason to doubt, but that the Enquire Act leaves the Rights and Diligences of the Creditors upon the same Foot, as if the said Act had never been made. So that unless the first Act for encouraging Superiors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be found in∣sufficient for securing the Rights and Diligences of Creditors, notwithstanding of the express and posi∣tive Declaration for that Purpose, the second Act can have no Influence, which neither gives nor takes away any Privileges with Regard to the Cre∣ditors, but only ratifies whatever Privileges they had a Right to by the said first Act.</P>
<P>In the Petition they do acknowledge the Bene∣fit given to Creditors by the aforesaid Act, for encouraging Superiors and Vassals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that the Rights and Diligences of all Creditors remain∣ing peaceable and dutiful, are preserv'd for any Prejudice that may arise from any Conviction or Attainder upon the Account of the High Treason of their Debitors, but does alledge, that as to the Inbringing and Receiving the Rents of the said for∣feit Estates, a particular Method is appointed by the other Act in the same Year of his Majesty's Reign, Intituled, <HI>An Act for appointing Commis∣sioners to enquire into the Estates of certain Tray∣tors;</HI> by a Clause of which Act (recited at large in the Petition) the Right and Possession of all the said forfeit Estates are vested in the Person of his Majesty; and all the Possessors of such E∣states are appointed to pay in the Rents thereof to the Exchequer, after previous Notice given to the said Commissioners of the particular Quantity and
<PB N="147" REF="412"/>
Quality of the said Estates, and the Yearly Rents and Values thereof; from whence they are pleased to infer, that the Sequestrations appointed by your Lordships must cease, and your Lordships Facto∣ries be recalled, leaving the Care of these Estates to the said Commissioners of Enquiry, according to the Meaning and Intent of the said Act for bring∣ing in the Rents to the Exchequer, in the Method the said Act prescribes.</P>
<P>The Creditors with great Submission think, that there is no Inconsistency in the continuance of your Lordships Factories, notwithstanding of what the said Act provides, either as to the Inbringing of the said Rents to the Exchequer, or for discovering the true Value and Extent of them; and they crave Liberty to observe, that his Majesty's Advocate and Sollicitor seems not to Notice, that the Act does not simply appoint the Rents to be paid into the Exchequer; <Q>but the Clause runs with an alter∣native in these Words, “and shall yield and pay into the Receipt of the Exchequer of <HI>Scotland,</HI> all and every the Rents payable, and of the said Estates, or otherwise account for the Profits of the same, during the Time of their Occupation, from the said 24th of <HI>June</HI> 1715, until the Sale or Sales so to be made thereof.”</Q> Whereby it appears, there is no absolute Order for paying the Rents into the Exchequer; but where a Possessor has just Reasons, either for retaining the whole Rents, or any Part of them, which may happen in many Cases, according to the various Circum∣stances of the Rights of such Possessors, there is no Obligation lies, save only to Account during the Time of their Possession, which does sufficiently an∣swer the Design of the Law, which here appears to be, to discover the full Extent and Value of the
<PB N="148" REF="413"/>
said Estates, and in whose Hands the same are, to the End that such Persons may afterwards be made liable for their Intromissions; but there appears nothing in the said Clause, and indeed, in no part of the Act, that points at the turning any Man out of his Possession; the Act only declaring all Possessors to be accountable to the Publick: At the making of which Accounts, the Titles of the re∣spective Possessors will fall to be Examined, and if found insufficient, can only then be set aside; so that those who possess by your Lordships Authority, as Factors, are in no different Case from any other Possessors, and stand accountable, as all other Pos∣sessors do, to the Publick, in the manner the Act of Enquiry has appointed; and are in the common Case with others, obliged to give Notice of their being in Possession, and of the Value and Yearly Rent of their Intromissions; which is all that the Act does require.</P>
<P>By which your Lordships will easily perceive, that neither the making the said Rents payable unto the Exchequer, nor the declaring all Possessors ac∣countable for their Intromissions, can afford any Ar∣gument for removing of your Lordships Factors, as if there were any Inconsistency in their continuing in the Possession, any more than any other Person; for they are accountable in the same manner as those must be, who may be put in their Places; and the Act plainly requires nothing farther, than that all Possessors in general shall be answerable for their Intromissions, without giving any Directions or Pow∣ers to the Commissioners of Enquiry, for making choice of particular Persons for the Management of the said Estates.</P>
<P>It will easily appear to your Lordships, That the Orders for paying in the Rents to the Exchequer,
<PB N="149" REF="414"/>
could not have been made Absolute, but must have had the Alternative for Accounting; for if all Pos∣sessors had been without Distirction ordained to pay∣ing, the Act for encouraging Superiors and Vas∣sals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> could not have taken Effect, which never∣theless is Ratified by the Act of Enquiry; for Supe∣riors remaining dutiful, could not be said to have had the Benefit of their rebellious Vassals Forfeitures, if they were instantly to advance and pay these Rents into the Exchequer; and no more could Landlords have the Benefit of the Tacks of Leases, which the Law makes void in case of the Tacksmens Rebelli∣on; neither could the Tenants retain the Two Years Rents, and continue free of Payment of any Duty, if whatever belonged to the Rebels, without Di∣stinction, were to be paid into the Exchequer; which makes it obvious, That the Alternative was abso∣lutely necessary to prevent the excluding any Man's Right, until it were Judged and Cognosced upon in a legal Way.</P>
<P>Neither does the Clause vesting the Right and Possession of the said forfeit Estates in the Person of his Majesty; nor that other Clause, appointing the Commissioners to take in all Claims upon the said Estates, to the End the said Claims may be deter∣mined by such Acts of Parliament as shall afterwards be made, much contribute to make out that Incon∣sistency which his Majesty's Advocate and Sollici∣tor pretends there is in your Lordships Factors con∣tinuing their Management; for as to the said Estates being vested in his Majesty, that must be understood to be in the same manner as they were in the Person of the Rebels, and consequently with the Burthen of the Debts and Diligences, chargeable upon the said Estates, which are preserved in the most exten∣sive manner, by the two above cited Acts of Par∣liament;
<PB N="150" REF="415"/>
and besides, whatever is under Sequestra∣tion by your Lordships Authority, is <HI>in Custodia Le∣gis</HI> for the behoof of the Crown, and of the Cre∣ditors, and all concerned, whose different Rights are unquestionably by the Law and Constitution of <HI>Scotland,</HI> determinable by your Court of Session, as the supreme Court in such Cases, and which, in all its Privileges and Authority, is expresly solved by the aforesaid Eighteen Articles of Union; and the declaring the Debts and Claims of the Creditors determinable by subsequent Laws, can be no hin∣derance; that in the mean time, all such Diligence may proceed as is competent to be used by the Laws of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Creditors must beg Liberty here to observe, the great Damage that must necessarily arise both to them and to the Publick, in case any stop should be put to your Lordships Factors, who as your Lordships know, are tied to many Regulations in their Management and manner of Compting, that the other Possessors or Factors will not be subject to; as particular, they are liable for the Interest of the Rents in their Hands after a certain time, which takes away a great Temptation others will have to delay the making of their Accounts: They are (besides several other Restraints put upon them) expresly made incapable to purchase any of the Cre∣ditors Rights upon the Estate they have in Manage∣ment; which Practice, before it was Discharged by your Lordships by a particular Act of <HI>Sederant,</HI> was of most pernicious Consequence to the Interest of the Creditors; and it's too much to be feared, may be used by such as are not legally debarred from it, to the Ruin of many poor necessitous People, whose Circumstance must force them to enter into any
<PB N="151" REF="416"/>
Transactions for their present Relief, though never so disadvantageous.</P>
<P>Another Consequence of the Removal of your Lordships Factors, will, in all appearance, be, that those who had the Possession before the Sequestra∣tion, will re-assume their Possession again, and insist upon their being only liable to Account as Possessors, according as the Act of Parliament does appoint; and tho' new Factors should be named by the Com∣missioners of Enquiry, yet it is so probable, the Tenants and Possessors of the said Estates may de∣cline to pay to these Factors, upon pretence that they have a Right to Compt immediately with the Publick; or may, perhaps, insist upon the said Fa∣ctors Discharge to them not being sufficient to acquit them in Law, since there is not any direct or express Power given to the Commissioners of Enquiry for naming such Factors; which Difficulties, as they will not easily be removed without Processes at Law, so, during such Disputes, 'tis but too certain the Subject must perish, to the Prejudice both of the Crown and the Creditors.</P>
<P>His Majesty's Advocate and Sollicitor seems to acknowledge the Necessity there was from the then situation of Affairs, for your Lordships interposing and appointing the Method of managing of the said Estates; but does alledge, that now that the Com∣missioners are in the Exercise of their Trust, and with the Exchequer have special Powers for the Pre∣servation and Ingathering of these Rents, the Clause of your Lordships granting the Factories has now ceased.</P>
<P>If his Majesty's Advocate and Sollicitor had ap∣pointed out the special Powers given the Commis∣sioners for ordering the Collecting and Ingathering of the said Rent, the Creditors should have been
<PB N="152" REF="417"/>
less selicitous by whom the Factories had been granted. But it is not asserted in any part of the Petition, that there is any express Clause in the aforesaid Act, naming the Management to be only by such Persons as should be appointed by the Com∣missioners; the Petition only insinuating it as a Mat∣ter of Expediency, that the Commissioners should have that Power for the better Executing of their Office, which the Creditors cannot but take as an Acknowledgment, that at least the Commissioners Powers, as to that particular, is doubtful; and so long as it remains so, your Lordships will be satis∣fied how great an Inconveniency would follow in case of removing those Factors already in the Ma∣nagement, when those to be put in their Places will be liable to such Exception, as cannot but occasion the greatest Confusion, as has been already noticed.</P>
<P>As to the Argument the Petition makes from the Power of the Commissioners of Enquiry, as to the disposing of the personal Goods and Chattels of the Rebels, that it ought to be equally extensive with regard to the real Estate; your Lordships will ob∣serve, that the Reason of committing the Goods and Chattels to the Commissioners Charge, which the Act takes notices of, was for preventing the Priesting of such Goods, or any Loss or Embezzlement that might happen; which was not to be feared, as to the Rents of the real Estates for which the Possessors are answerable, and which seems to be a good Rea∣son why the Law has not thought fit to commit the securing of those likewise to the Commissioners Charge.</P>
<P>The Petition takes notices, that the said Factors were appointed by your Lordships upon the Appli∣cation of the Creditors, and the Security taken be∣ing only in view of their Interest, without regard
<PB N="153" REF="418"/>
to the Concern the Publick had in these Estates; there was no Reason for the Publick to acquiesce, or think so great Sums as may happen to come to the Hands of these Factors, to be safely lodged as to this Point; 'tis humbly thought there will be little Reason to doubt of the sufficiency of the Security with regard to the Creditors Debts only, but accor∣dingly to the value of the Subject to be intromitted with; and no doubt, whatever the Publick can pro∣pose for making the Security unexceptionable, will be gone into by your Lordships, and will be very acceptable to the Creditors; but even the altering any of the Factors upon the Account of any Obje∣ctions against the sufficiency of their Security, will not take off the Sequestration it self, which stands upon the sort of a Judicial Sentence of your Lord∣ships, and so cannot be removed, but according to the Form and Procedure of the Court, by an Action of Reduction; so that upon the whole, it must cer∣tainly be acknowledged, that no Method of Ma∣nagement can be supposed to be more advantageous in all Respects, both for the Interest of the Crown, that of the Creditors, and all others concerned, than the present, under your Lordships Direction, which the Creditors humbly hope will not be alter'd.</P>
<P>In Respect whereof, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Dun Forbes.</P>
<P>After this there needs no farther entring into the Case: Upon this Answer, the Lords gave Sen∣tence, that they could not recal the Factors which they had granted upon the forfeited Estates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="419"/>
This Sentence is called in their Law an <HI>Interlocutor,</HI> and is as follows:</P>
<Q><P>Decree or Interlocutor of the Court of Session thereon, denying the recalling the said <HI>Seque∣strations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE Lords having again considered the Petition for his Majesty's Advocate and Sollicitor, desi∣ring the Factories formerly granted upon the forfeited Estates to be recalled, and the Care thereof left to the Commissioners of Enquiry, and the Answers to the said Petition for the Claimants upon the said Estates, and having advised the same with the Debate, they find, that the Rents and Issues of forfeited Estates may be legally Sequestrated by Authority of the Lords of Session, upon Application of Creditors and others, claiming Interest therein by virtue of their several Rights and Diligences, and therefore re∣fuse the Desire of the Petition, without Prejudice to the Petitioners to insist, that the Factors, after just Satisfaction made to Creditors, and other just Clai∣mants preferable to the Crown, should pay into the Exchequer the superplus for the behoof of the Pub∣lick, as Law directs; as also after extinguishing of the said preferable Claims by Payment or otherwise, to apply for removing the said Sequestration as ac∣cords; and also reserving to the Petitioners to object, in the mean time, against any particular Sequestra∣tion granted, or against the Choice of any Factor named, or against the Sufficiency of the Security gi∣ven by any of the Factors named.</HI></P></Q>

<P><PB N="156" REF="421"/>
The first Parliament Business we meet with this Year, is in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Bolton</HI> being Lord Lieutenant, the Parliament set down the <HI>27th,</HI> when the new Peers who were Created as above, being Introduc'd, the Duke open'd the Session with the following Speech.</P>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>HIS Majesty has commanded me to acquaint you, That it is to His great Satisfaction, your pre∣sent Meeting in Parliament is in a Time of publick Peace and Tranquillity, and after the entire Sup∣pression of the late unnatural Rebellion, which your seasonable Loyalty and Zeal, not only kept out of this Kingdom, but contributed likewise to extinguish in</HI> Great Britain. <HI>As the Miseries this Nation hath heretofore experienced from a Popish Government, could not but animate you to distinguish your selves on that Occasion, you may be assured that His Majesty will make suitable Returns to such Instances of your Duty and Affection, by supporting and maintaining you in the full and free Enjoyment of all your Reli∣gious and Civil Rights.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>Your vigorous Resolutions, added to your Vote of Credit in the late critical Juncture, were so accepta∣ble to his Majesty, that tho' He has, by His Act of Grace, Pardoned those who were ingaged in the late Rebellion, he will always remember the Loyal and Affectionate Endeavours of such who were so active to defeat it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You must be sensible, that the Charge occasion'd by those Disturbances, has considerably augmented the National Debt, which has been chiefly incurred since that time; an exact and just Account of which,</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="422"/>
<HI>and of what it consists, shall be laid before you. And I am to acquaint you, that His Majesty, to prevent its Increase, has given Orders for such Reductions in the Military List, as He thinks may be consistent with your present Security, and has put the new Establishment into such a Form, as will shew you the real Number of effective Men you have to depend on. His Majesty has likewise thought fit to lessen the Civil List on the Head of Pensions, and has di∣rected such Rules to be observed, as may annually abate the Expence upon them: But as the yearly Charge of the Establishment exceeds the annual Pro∣duce of the Revenue, His Majesty doubts not to have such Aids and Supplies granted him, as will sup∣port the Establishment and discharge the Debt; and that you will agree on the Means of doing it with the same Unanimity, as you did when it was necessa∣ry to contract it.</HI></P></Q>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>I think my self obliged to take Notice to you, of His Majesty's great Goodness, in having lately passed an Act in the Parliament of</HI> Great-Britain, <HI>for the Encouragement of the Linen Manufacture in this Kingdom. And am commanded by his Majesty to recommend to you, in a very particular Manner, Unanimity and Agreement amongst your selves in all your Proceedings, which His Majesty conceives must be of the utmost Importance to His Service, and your own Security, in a Country where there is so great a Disproportion between the Friends and Enemies of our Religion, Laws and Liberties.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I cannot conclude, without expressing the Satisfacti∣on I have, in His Majesty's sending me again to a Kingdom, where I had formerly the Honour to serve the late King</HI> William <HI>of Glorious Memory, as one of</HI>

<HI>the Lords Justices, and where I then received so many Instances of your good Will towards me. I shall endeavour still to preserve your Affections, by repre∣senting your Actions in a just and true Light to His Majesty, and by doing every thing in my Power, that may conduce to the publick Good.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as the Commons were gone back to their House, and their Speaker had reported the Speech, they unanimously Voted an Address of Thanks to the Lord Lieutenant for his Speech, and the Lords did the like in their House; These Addresses being as well to the King as to the Lord Lieutenant, and being only Things of Course, consisting of Compli∣ments to the Lord Lieutenant, and Assurances of Duty and Loyalty to the King, I omit, as too long to take Place here.</P>
<P>This Parliament, to give them their due, pass'd a great many excellent Laws for the Improvement, Advantage and Security, as well of Religion as of Commerce, Planting, Manufacturing in the King∣dom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Also they revived a great many expiring Laws, of all which I shall speak in their Place.</P>
<P>But with these good Things, they forgot not beginning where they left off, <HI>viz.</HI> in the prosecu∣ting the Offenders of the former Times: And tho' the King had shewn them an Example of Clemency, in publishing an Act of Grace for the Ease of his People, they did not think fit to let the Example be sufficient to recommend itself to them, in the Case which at that Time was before them; nay, as a Wri∣ter of that Time published, so vindictive was the Temper reigning at that Time, that they took so little Notice of the Pattern set by his Majesty, that they even refused to accept the Penitence of a Gentleman of their own House, who humbly ac∣knowledged
<PB N="159" REF="424"/>
his Offence, declared himself to be hear∣tily sorry for it, and begg'd Pardon of the House, or at least was ready to do so; but when it came to the Question in the House, Whether his humble Ac∣knowledgment should be accepted by the House? it pass'd in the <HI>Negative;</HI> and they order'd him to be expelled the House; and yet this great Crime was much less than those forgiven by his Majesty, for it was neither Treason, or Rebellion; only that it seems he had signed an Address to the late Queen from the County of <HI>Lowth,</HI> in Opposition to an Address of the late House of Commons.</P>
<P>For this capital Offence, tho' abundance of Gen∣tlemen has been excused the last Session upon their Submission, and others had been censur'd, the Re∣sentment was not thereby allay'd; but on the <HI>9th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> or thereabout, they call'd upon one <HI>John Leigh,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for signing the Address from the Coun∣ty of <HI>Lowth</HI> in the late Queen's Time, and the Ad∣dress being read, they order'd that Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> be now called upon in his Place, to give an Account of his Reasons for signing the said Address; which be∣ing done, Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> stood up in his Place, confessed he had sign'd the said Address, that he was heartily sorry for his Fault, and humbly begg'd Pardon of the House.</P>
<P>Upon this the Question was put, That the Sub∣mission of Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> be accepted as a Satisfaction to the House; and a Debate arising upon it, the Debate was put off to that Day Sevennight, when being called again, and the Debate revived, it pas∣sed in the Negative, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Submission should not be accepted, and thereupon Mr. <HI>Leigh</HI> was expelled the House.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="425"/>
In this Manner the House went on, not omitting, however, the publick Business; all the Supplies the King demanded they readily came into, and made effectual Provisions for: Likewise they recom∣mended several Sufferers in the former Reign to the Government for Relief and Rewards; so that they exercis'd some Charity as well as Justice.</P>
<P>There was indeed one Thing moved in the Par∣liament, which we shall only touch here, hoping to hear more of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Archbishop of—, moved in the House of Peers, that for the Honour of Religion, and for propagating the Reformation in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he was willing to divest himself of a considerable Part of the Revenues of his Bishoprick, to augment the Stipends and Income of poor Livings in the Country, and for the Encou∣ragement of the inferior Clergy to do their Duty; that their Maintenance may be sufficient to support them in the Discharge of their Duty. We find lit∣tle Notice taken of this Piece of Christian Genero∣sity; but we shall not fail to Record it, and give due Acknowledgments to it, that Posterity may see there have been some among us, in this Age of the Church's Degeneracy, who have yet been moved with a Spirit of true Christianity, and a disinterested Zeal for the Protestant Religion, and the Reforma∣tion, even in <HI>Ireland</HI> it self: We do not hear yet what Encouragement such a pious Proposal has met with; we know it was at first seconded by very few; but there is Hope yet that it may revive.</P>
<P>Tho' 'tis some Interruption to the Story of the Parliament, yet I cannot omit here, that 'tis to an Accident in this Year, that we say the Rise of the formidable Body of Pirates is owing, who to this Day infest our Commerce and Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> commonly call'd the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> the best Ac∣count
<PB N="161" REF="426"/>
I meet with of this Affair, is as fol∣lows,</P>
<P>To begin at the beginning of it, we must observe, That sundry Causes are assign'd to this Evil, but principally this, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI> are very chary of their Commerce, that is to say, to prevent our Sloops and Brigantines appearing upon their Coast from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and other Places, to car∣ry on a private Trade there; and two or three <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Men of War plied so diligently upon the Coast of <HI>Cartagena</HI> and St. <HI>Martha,</HI> that our Sloops could not Trade there without great Danger, and one or two were taken: This so exasperated our <HI>Jamaica</HI> Traders, that taking a sufficient Force with them, they resolved upon a private Expedition, to be re∣veng'd of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly two Ships and three Sloops were fitted out, some from <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> others from St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> but Mann'd among the Adventu∣rers, as they call them, or at least Mann'd with some of them; these are they we call <HI>Campeachy</HI> Men, but who are indeed no better or worse than <HI>Buccaneers;</HI> that is, Fellows ready for any Adven∣ture, to Rob or Plunder any one they could fall up∣on. These Vessels being joined, go away to the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> where the <HI>Spanish</HI> Galleons or Plate Fleet, had, two Years before, been Wreck'd and cast away, and where they were at Work with several Vessels from the <HI>Havana,</HI> with divers En∣gines, to Fish up the Silver that was on Board the Galleons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had recover'd several Millions of Pieces of Eight, and had carried it all to the <HI>Hava∣na;</HI> but they had at present about 350000 Pieces of Eight in Silver then upon the Spot, and were daily taking up more. This Money was left on Shore,
<PB N="162" REF="427"/>
the Men in the Vessels sending on Shore every Night what they Fished up in the Day; and there it was deposited in a Store-house, under the Government of two Commissaries, and a Guard of about Sixty Soldiers.</P>
<P>Our Rovers come directly to the Spot, bring their little Fleet to an Anchor, and, in a Word, landing Three Hundred Men, they attack'd the Guard, who immediately run away, and thus they seized the Treasure, which they carried away, making the best of their way to <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>In their way they unhappily met with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship, bound from <HI>Porto Bello</HI> to the <HI>Havana,</HI> with a great many rich Goods, <HI>viz.</HI> Bales of <HI>Cochineal,</HI> Casks of <HI>Indico,</HI> and 60000 Pieces of Eight more, which their Hands being in, they took also, and ha∣ving rifled the Vessel, let her go.</P>
<P>They went away to <HI>Jamaica</HI> with their Booty, and were followed thither, that is, in View of the Port, by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who having seen them thither, went back to the Governor of the <HI>Havana</HI> with the Account of it, who immediately sent a Vessel to the Governor of <HI>Jamaica</HI> to complain of this Robbery, and to reclaim the Goods.</P>
<P>As it was in full Peace, and contrary to all Justice and Right that this Fact was committed, they were soon made sensible that the Government at <HI>Jamaica</HI> would not suffer them to go unpunished, much less protect them: They therefore saw a Necessity of shifting for themselves, and so to make Bad Worse, they went to Sea again, tho' not without disposing their Cargo to good Advantage, and furnishing them∣selves with Ammunition, Provision, and better Ships, and being thus made Desperate, they turn'd Pirates, robbing not the <HI>Spaniards</HI> only, but their own Coun∣try-men, and any Nation they could lay their Hands on.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="428"/>
Add to this, another Misfortune, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with Seven or Eight small Men of War, falling about this Time upon the <HI>Buccaneers,</HI> or <HI>Log∣wood-Cutters,</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and taking all their Ships from them, and forcing the Men to Surrender upon Condition of having their Lives given them, and a Vessel, tho' with no Fire Arms or Ammunition, to carry them Home: These Men, made desperate, fell in with the rest, and encreased their Number.</P>
<P>It would be too long to give an Account here of their Piracies; it may suffice to observe, that they took abundance of Ships, and plundered them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>always of Three Things, <HI>viz.</HI> Money, Ammuni∣tion, and Victuals, and by this Means grew vastly Rich: and, as in such Cases it always happens, all the loose, rakish, desperate Fellows in the Islands, that had nothing to do, or live on, and were bent for Mischief and Adventures, got toge∣ther, and went to them, till at last growing very strong, they consulted together about getting some Retreat, where they might lodge their Wealth, re∣pair their Ships, and make themselves a kind of Abode.</P>
<P>They were not long in resolving; but sailing di∣rectly to the Isle of <HI>Providence,</HI> or <HI>New Providence,</HI> they seiz'd upon it, landed their People, and fell to work to fortify. Here they now reign, and be∣ing, as we hear, about Four Thousand Men, and Twenty or Thirty Vessels of all Sorts, they rove about the Sea, scouring the Coasts of our Colonies of <HI>Carolina, Virginia,</HI> nay, up as high as <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> to the inconceivable Prejudice of Commerce, and Ruin of our People.</P>
<P>The Government having been applied to for Re∣lief in this Case, have, at the Motion of some
<PB N="164" REF="429"/>
People, who know something of the Disposition of these Pirates, first taken the gentle Method of of∣fering them a Pardon by Proclamation: which Pro∣clamation Sir <HI>Nicholas Lawes,</HI> the New Gover∣nour of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who is now going over, is to carry with him; in which also is included, Re∣wards to all those who shall seize and apprehend any of them, after the Time for accepting that Pardon is elaps'd. The Proclamation is very par∣ticular and worth Recording, and that with the Proclamation may be seen the Account the Go∣vernment had of them, and the Means used for sup∣pressing them, we have also given the Appoint∣ment of the Men of War for that Service, and the Measures taken for the attacking them, as fol∣lows:</P>
<P><HI>Whitehall,</HI> <DATE><HI>September</HI> 15.</DATE></P>
<P>COmplaint having been made to His Majesty, by great Numbers of Merchants, Masters of Ships, or others, as well as by several Gover∣nours of His Majesty's Islands and Plantations in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> that the Pirates are grown so numerous, that they infest not only the Seas near <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but even those of the <HI>Northern</HI> Conti∣nent of <HI>America;</HI> and that unless some effectual Means be used, the whole Trade from <HI>Great-Bri∣tain</HI> to those Parts, will not only be obstructed, but in imminent Danger of being lost: His Ma∣jesty has, upon mature Deliberation in Council, been graciously pleas'd, in the first Place, to or∣der a proper Force to be employ'd for suppressing the said Piracies, which Force so to be employ'd, is as follows:</P>

And that nothing may be wanting for the more effectually putting an End to the said Piracies, His Majesty has also been graciously pleased to issue the following Proclamation.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>By the King, A PROCLAMATION, For Suppressing of PIRATES.</HEAD>
<Q><P><HI>GEORGE</HI> R.</P>
<P><HI>WHereas we have received Information, that several Persons, Subjects of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>have since the Twenty fourth Day of</HI> June, <HI>in the Year of our Lord, One thousand seven hundred and fifteen, committed divers Piracies and Robberies up∣on the High Seas in the</HI> West Indies, <HI>or adjoyning to our Plantations, which hath and may occasion great Damage to the Merchants of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>and others, trading into those Parts; and though we have appointed such a Force as we judge sufficient for suppressing the said Piracies, yet the more ef∣fectually to put an End to the same, we have thought fit, by and with the Advice of our Privy Council, to issue this our Royal Proclamation; and we do here∣by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and declare, that in Case any of the said Pirates shall, on or before the Fifth Day of</HI> Septem∣ber, <HI>in the Year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred and eighteen, surrender him or themselves to one of our Principal Secretaries of State in</HI> Great Britain <HI>or</HI> Ireland, <HI>or to any Governour, or Deputy-Governour of any of our Plantations beyond the Seas, every such Pirate and Pirates so surrendring him or themselves, as aforesaid, shall have our gracious Par∣don of and for such his or their Piracy or Piracies, by him or them committed before the Fifth of</HI> January
<PB N="167" REF="432"/>
<HI>next ensuing. And we do hereby strictly charge and command all our Admirals, Captains, and other Officers at Sea, and all our Governours and Com∣manders of any Forts, Castles, or other Places in our Plantations, and all other our Officers Civil and Military, to seize and take such of the Pirates, who shall refuse or neglect to surrender themselves accordingly. And we do hereby farther declare, that in case any Person or Persons, on or after the Sixth Day of</HI> September, <HI>One thousand seven hundred and eighteen, shall discover, or seize, or cause, or pro∣cure to be discovered, or seized, any one or more of the said Pirates, so refusing or neglecting to surren∣der themselves, as aforesaid, so as they may be brought to Justice, and convicted of the said Offence, such Person or Persons, so making such Discovery or Seizure, or causing or procuring such Discovery or Seizure, to be made, shall have and receive as a Reward for the same,</HI> viz. <HI>for every Commander of any private Ship or Vessel, the Sum of One Hundred Pounds; for every Lieutenant, Master, Boatswain, Carpenter, and Gunner, the Sum of Forty Pounds; for every Inferior Officer the Sum of Thirty Pounds; and for every private Man the Sum of Twenty Pounds. And if any Person or Persons belonging to, and being Part of the Crew of any such Pirate Ship or Vessel, shall, on or after the said Sixth Day of</HI> September, <HI>One thousand seven hundred and eigh∣teen, seize and deliver, or cause to be seized or de∣livered, any Commander or Commanders of such Pi∣rate Ship or Vessel, so as that he or they be brought to Justice, and convicted of the said Offence, such Person or Persons, as a Reward for the same, shall receive for every such Commander the Sum of Two Hundred Pounds; which said Sums, the Lord Trea∣surer, or the Commissioners of our Treasury for the</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="433"/>
<HI>Time being, are hereby required and directed to pay accordingly.</HI></P>
<P>Given at our Court at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> the <DATE>Fifth Day of <HI>September,</HI> 1717,</DATE> in the Fourth Year of our Reign.</P>
<P>God Save the KING.</P></Q>
<P>And whereas it has also been represented to His Majesty, that in <HI>March,</HI> 1705-6, the House of Lords did, in an Address to Her late Majesty, <Q>set forth, “That the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> had twice, during that War, over-run and plunder'd the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands; That there was no Form of Go∣vernment there: That the Harbour of the Island of <HI>Providence</HI> might be easily put in a Posture of Defence, and that it would be of dangerous Consequence should those Islands fall into the Hands of an Enemy; wherefore the Lords hum∣bly besought Her Majesty, to use such Methods as she should think proper, for taking the said Island into her Hands, in order to secure the same to the Crown of this Kingdom, and to the Security and Advantage of the Trade thereof:”</Q> But that there were not any Means used, in Com∣pliance with that Address, for securing the said <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands; and that at this Time the Pi∣rates have a Lodgment with a Battery on <HI>Harbour</HI> Island, one of the <HI>Bahamas;</HI> as also, that the usual Retreat and general Receptacle for Pirates is at <HI>Pro∣vidence,</HI> the principal of those Islands: His Ma∣jesty has been farther graciously pleas'd to give Di∣rections for dislodging those Pirates who have ta∣ken Shelter in the said Islands, as also as for secu∣ring those Islands, and making Settlements and a
<PB N="169" REF="434"/>
Fortification there, for the Safety and Benefit of Trade and Navigation in those Seas for the fu∣ture.</P>
<P>But I return to the Proceedings in the <HI>Irish</HI> Par∣liament; their Resentments at some Proceedings by the Mayor of <HI>Gallway,</HI> and some other of the Citi∣zens there, were carried so high, that the Mayor Mr. <HI>Coates,</HI> with one Mr. <HI>Staunton</HI> and others, fled from them to <HI>England,</HI> where they publish'd their Case, and laid it before the Parliament in <HI>England;</HI> but it is too long for these Sheets, and as we are told it is likely to come upon the Stage again be∣fore an English Parliament, I may refer it to that Time.</P>
<P>They had the like Dispute before them on Account of the City of <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> in both which Cases things went with an high hand against the Proceed∣ings in those Cities in the late Times, the opposite Party were all censur'd, and those who did not abscond, were order'd to be taken into Custody.</P>
<P>Likewise this <HI>Irish</HI> Parliament did one thing which we very rarely see done in <HI>England;</HI> this was, that whereas several Members had been order'd to be ta∣ken into Custody the Year before, but had abscon∣ded till the Sessions was over, believing themselves secure after the Prorogation, as is the Custom here, the House caused enquiry to be made after it, and issued new Orders for taking them into Custody now on the former Account; but they also absconded again: And as for the Citizens of <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> who they censur'd, they order'd a Bill to be brought in to disfranchise them, <HI>(viz.)</HI> four Aldermen, one Common-Council Man and one Freeman; and for the better regulating the said Corporation.</P>
<P>They continued sitting till the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> when all Things being arrived from <HI>England,</HI> were
<PB N="170" REF="435"/>
pass'd by the Lord Lieutenant, and then they were prorogued.</P>
<P>At their presenting the Money-Bills, their Spea∣ker made a long Speech, and at the conclusion of all, the Houses deliver'd very dutiful Addresses to the Lord Lieutenant, to be transmitted to the King, and thus their long Session ended, and we are likely to hear no more of them for a good while, being since that prorogued to <HI>August</HI> 1719.</P>
<P>Before I come to the Meeting of the <HI>British</HI> Par∣liament, several material Things occur to be re∣corded, of which I shall speak what is necessary, but as briefly as possible.</P>
<P>The King having resolv'd not to go into <HI>Germany</HI> this last Summer, resided at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> all the Summer Season, where his Majesty drank the Wa∣ters of <HI>Pyrmont,</HI> which he had caused to be brought over on purpose, and having finished the usual Course of taking the Waters, the King resolved to take a Tour into the Country, and particularly to <HI>New-Market</HI> to see the Horse-Races.</P>
<P>The King set out from <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> the <HI>2d,</HI> and tho' he was much stopp'd by the tedious pas∣sing thro' <HI>Southwark,</HI> over the Bridge, and thro' the City, yet fresh Horses being laid at short Stages, they drove thro' in a Day, and the King came thither about Seven a Clock in the Evening.</P>
<P>It would take up too much Room here to enter into the Particulars of the Journey; how the Coun∣try People flock'd to see the King; and what Joy they shew'd on that Occasion: But his Majesty's visiting the University cannot be omitted. The Vice-Chancellor, Mr. <HI>Gregg,</HI> with the Heads of the Colleges, waited on his Majesty in Form at <HI>New-Market,</HI> and made their Compliment; to which the King returned the following Answer:</P>
<PB N="171" REF="436"/>
<Q><P>Mr. Vice-Chancellor,</P>
<P>I <HI>Thank you for the Assurance you give me of your Duty and Affection, and the Ʋniversity may al∣ways depend on my Favour and Encouragement.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Then they invited his Majesty to the University, which was accepted, and accordingly the King went, as we shall see presently. In the mean time, the Gentlemen were very magnificently treated at Din∣ner by his Majesty's special Order, and went Home to prepare to do the like to the King.</P>
<P>At <HI>New-Market,</HI> the Sport and the Pleasure of the Country was very much abated, by the violent, and almost incessant Rains; but the King was, how∣ever, on Horseback early, hunted a Hare in the Morning, and then came upon the Course, and saw the Races.</P>
<P>The next Day his Majesty din'd at <HI>Chippenham,</HI> a fine new built Seat of the Earl of <HI>Orford</HI>'s, built all new, and which, with the Gardens, it is said cost his Lordship Forty Thousand Pieces.</P>
<P>The next Day being <HI>Sunday,</HI> the King went to <HI>Cambridge.</HI> His Reception there, and what pass'd upon that Occasion, I shall give in a few Words. His Majesty was first met out of the Town by the Magistrates, or Corporation, according to the Usage on such Occasions; when the Mayor addressing him∣self very handsomly to the King, made the Town's Present, which is a Purse with a certain Number of Pieces of Gold, which it seems they are obliged to, as often as, or perhaps the first Time, that the Sovereign comes to the Place.</P>
<P>For the Reception of his Majesty by the Univer∣sity, the Schollars were placed in their Habits, and in the College Order, in a Line on each Street, and
<PB N="172" REF="437"/>
were ordered to Shout in <HI>Latin</HI> as the King passed by, <HI>VIVAT REX:</HI> It is said they were or∣der'd to kneel at the same time, but the Croud made that impracticable. The Mayor and Corporation came on before his Majesty in their Formalities bare-headed, and stopping at the School, his Ma∣jesty was received there with a <HI>Latin</HI> Oration pro∣nounced kneeling, by Dr. <HI>Ayloff,</HI> the University O∣rator: After this, his Majesty entred the Schools, where the Vice-Chancellor Mr. <HI>Gregg,</HI> who till then was not a Graduate, was made Doctor, as also another, that the King might see the Manner of the Commencement; after which, the King gave them a List of Names, being such as his Majesty thought fit to have created Doctors, or of other Degrees.</P>
<P>From hence they went to <HI>King</HI>'s College Chap∣pel in the same Order, where his Majesty heard Di∣vine Service, the Bishop of <HI>Norwich</HI> turning over the Common Prayer Book, and pointing out the Prayers to the King. After the Sermon, his Ma∣jesty went to <HI>Trinity</HI> College; he was received in the College Hall by Dr. <HI>Bentley,</HI> attended by the whole Body of the Fellows and Students: The Doctor made a Speech to his Majesty, and, after the usual Ceremony, the King din'd in the Master's, Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s Appartment, the said Master waiting at Table. In the Evening his Majesty having been pleased to let the University know that he was well pleased with his Entertainment, and having Knight∣ed Mr. <HI>Thompson</HI> of <HI>Trumpington,</HI> returned to <HI>New-Market,</HI> and the next Day came back to <HI>Hamp∣ton Court.</HI></P>

<P>It was observable, that when the King went thro' the City for <HI>New-Market,</HI> as above, a poor Fellow, by Trade a Weaver, crowding to see the King in the Street of <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> was thrust down so under the Coach that the King's Coach Wheel wnt over his Leg and broke it: The King call'd out to
<PB N="175" REF="440"/>
some of his Servants to order the Man to be taken Care of, which was done, and when the Man was cured, upon Application to his Majesty by the King's own Surgeon, the King order'd him <HI>50 l.</HI> in Money to pay for the Cure, and a Pension of <HI>20 l.</HI> a Year during his Life.</P>
<P>In this Interval of the King's Progress to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the Princess of <HI>Wales</HI> being great with Child, re∣moved to St. <HI>James</HI>'s for her lying in, and on the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>November</HI> she was safely deliver'd of a Prince, which was for a while the occasion of great Rejoi∣cings; but all that soon inverted, and the unhappy Infant was innocently the Original of a melancholy Scene at Court, which is not yet removed.</P>
<P>By this I mean the Breach between the King and the Prince, his Majesty's only Son, which begin∣ning at the Solemnity of the Christening of the Prince's Son, ended in banishing the Prince himself from the Court, and from the Presence and Council of the King his Father, which Breach and Distance remains so to this Day.</P>
<P>In a few Days after the Princess was brought to Bed, the Season growing extreme Wet, and the sitting of the Parliament, or at least the Preparati∣ons for it, requiring particular Application, his Ma∣jesty with the whole Court came to Town.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> and as it were to anticipate the Applications which were preparing to be made from several Parts of the Country to the Parliament, for disbanding the Army, the King of his own accord seeing all things in Peace, order'd a Reduction of the Forces.</P>
<P>This Reduction was very considerable, tho' not so much as some thought reasonable, for the re∣maining Army amounted to above 16000, which being near double the Number of the usual <HI>British</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="441"/>
Establishment in Time of Peace, caused great Strug∣gles in the ensuing Parliament for a farther Reducti∣on, as shall be shewed in its Place.</P>
<P>This Reduction being once Resolv'd on, was put in Execution with such Celerity, that between the <HI>13th</HI> and the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>November</HI> all the Troops were reduc'd, and the new Model of the Army form'd.</P>
<P>In this Interval, the Convocation met pursuant to their former Prorogation, but found no Access to enter upon the Business which was expected, <HI>viz.</HI> the Controversy with the Bishop of <HI>Bangor:</HI> On the contrary, they met with a farther Prorogation for some Months longer. Some thought, that up∣on the Occasion of this Prorogation, the Bishop of <HI>Bangor</HI> would have been desired, or at least of his own accord, and to shew himself a fair Adversary, would have likewise forborn entring any farther into the Controversy in Print, and that consequently, his Answer to the Report of the Convocation, of which the World had frequent Hints that it was preparing, would have been laid aside, till the Convocation had been at Liberty of Acting, and might have had Opportunity of replying again.</P>
<P>But they who thought so, either knew not the Bishop, or knew nothing of his Designs; for upon Assurance of the Prorogation being at hand, his Answer was prepar'd; but whether upon Assurance of its being Prorogued the Answer was resolved to be published, is not equally certain: Be that as it will, on the <HI>Monday</HI> after the Parliament met, his Lordship's Answer to the Convocation was pub∣lished.</P>
<P>On the <HI>21st</HI> of <HI>November</HI> the Parliament met, and the King open'd the Session as usual with a Speech, as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<PB N="177" REF="442"/>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I <HI>Am very glad I have been able to bring the Sitting of Parliament into a more proper and usual Sea∣son of the Year: I hope such an early Meeting will not only be a Benefit to the Publick, but a Conveni∣ence to your Private Affairs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As I have always had at Heart the Security and Ease of my People; so I never kept up any Troops but for their Protection, and have taken every Op∣portunity to Disband as many as I thought consistent with their Safety. I have Reduced the Army to very near one half, since the Beginning of the last Session of Parliament, and Lessened them to such a Num∣ber, as will neither be a Burthen to my good Sub∣jects, nor an Encouragement to our Enemies to In∣sult them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You cannot but be sensible of the many Attempts which have been set on foot to disturb the Peace of</HI> Europe, <HI>and of these Kingdoms: They only pretend not to see, who are not afraid of them. But as no Application has been wanting on my Part to preserve the Publick Tranquillity; I have the Pleasure to find my good Offices have not been altogether Ʋnsuccessful, and have Reason to hope they will, in the End, have their full and desired Effect.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I question not but you are very well pleased to find that your Endeavours for lessening the National Debts, have at the same time rais'd the Publick Cre∣dit; and that whatever was proposed for that End, is actually and compleatly effected. This Success must chiefly be attributed to that just and prudent</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="443"/>
<HI>Regard you have shewn to Parliamentary Engage∣ments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was with the View of procuring and settling a lasting Tranquillity, that I demanded the Extraordi∣nary Supply which you granted Me last Session. The Credit which this Confidence reposed in Me hath gi∣ven us Abroad, his already been so far effectual, that I can acquaint you we have a much better Pro∣spect than we had. I have ordered an Account to be laid before you, of the very small Part of that Sup∣ply which as yet has been expended; any farther Issues that may be made of it, shall be also laid before you: And you may be assured, that every Part of it shall either be imployed for your Service, or saved to the Publick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have ordered to be laid before you a State of the Deficiencies of the present Year, and the several Esti∣mates for the Service of the next, which you will find considerably diminished. I rely upon your ma∣king the necessary Provision for them; not doubting of the Continuance of that Zeal for the Good of your Country, which hath been so eminently Conspicuous in every Session of this Parliament.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I cannot, in Justice, avoid putting you in mind, that several Arrears of Pay and Subsidy, incurred before My Accession to the Crown, are claimed by Fo∣reign Princes and States: I shall order them to be laid before you, to the End you may put them in a Method of being Examined and Stated; which will very much tend to the Honour and Credit of the Na∣tion.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>I could heartily wish, that at a Time when the Com∣mon Enemies of our Religion are, by all manner of</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="444"/>
<HI>Artifices, endeavouring to undermine and weaken it both at Home and Abroad, all those who are Friends to our present happy Establishment, might unanimously concur in some proper Method for the greater strengthning the Protestant Interest; of which, as the Church of</HI> England <HI>is unquestionably the main Sup∣port and Bulwark, so will She reap the principal Be∣nefit of every Advantage accruing by the Union, and mutual Charity of all Protestants.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As none can recommend themselves more effectually to my Favour and Countenance than by a sincere Zeal for the just Rights of the Crown, and the Liberties of the People; so I am determined to Encourage all those who act agreeably to the Constitution of these My Kingdoms, and consequently to the Principles on which My Government is founded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Eyes of all</HI> Europe <HI>are upon you at this Criti∣cal Juncture: It is your Interest, for which Reason I think it Mine, that my Endeavours for procuring the Peace and Quiet of</HI> Christendom <HI>should take Ef∣fect. Nothing can so much contribute to this de∣sirable End, as the Unanimity, Dispatch, and Vigour of your Resolutions for the Support of My Govern∣ment.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Addresses and Answers following this Speech as things of Course, I also of Course omit, being too tedious and of too little import to interrupt the Thread of my Story; it is enough to say they were full of dutiful Expressions, Promises of complying with, and dispatching what the King demanded, and the like.</P>
<P>Besides the usual Addresses, the Houses took up some Time in congratulating the Royal Family on the Birth of the young Prince; this they did to the
<PB N="180" REF="445"/>
Prince by a Message, but to the King by an Ad∣dress.</P>
<P>The Part of the King's Speech, which pointed at the Liberty of the Dissenters, and taking off the restraining Laws from them, gave great Um∣brage for a while; but as the House offer'd no∣thing at it, and the Court push'd it no farther, all the Strife and Dissatisfaction which that Affair threaten'd in its Time, was happily and wisely prevented.</P>
<P>While these Things were doing, we had a little Spice of Rebellion in the <HI>West</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> but tho' some People went a great way to persuade us there was some Jacobitism and Treason in it, yet it must be confess'd, upon a clear Enquiry into the Fact, there was nothing of that kind to be found in it; only a little popular Discontent between the Weavers, Wool-combers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> and their Employers about the Rates of their Wages, working <HI>Irish</HI> Yarn, and the like; and yet we will not say, but the Disorder was such as may bring a few of them to the Gallows, if his Majesty's Cle∣mency do not interpose.</P>
<P>It was the latter End of <HI>November,</HI> that Sir <HI>George Eyng,</HI> with the <HI>English</HI> Squadron of Men of War returned from the <HI>Baltick,</HI> after a very rough, stor∣my, hazardous Voyage, bringing over with him under his Convoy 200 Sail of Merchant Ships, and not having yet found any occasion of Hostility against the <HI>Swedish</HI> Fleet, or been able to discover any thing of the great Design which it was said the <HI>Swedes</HI> had against us in Favour of the Preten∣der.</P>
<P>It was the third of the same Month that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Son was baptiz'd, and upon the occasion
<PB N="181" REF="446"/>
whereof, some Words happen'd between the Prince and the Duke of <HI>Newc—e;</HI> which Words, and the Circumstances of them, were such, as gave the King great Offence, and from which has proceeded all the Misunderstanding that has happen'd since between the Prince and the King his Father.</P>
<P>I will not enter into this Story in my own Words, but keeping only to the Truth of that Fact as near as I can give it in the Form in which it has been already published; for I shall be very loth to give Offence on one Side or on the other.</P>
<P>The Third of <HI>December</HI> was appointed for the baptizing the young Prince, the King's Grandson; his Royal Highness the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> Father to the Royal Infant, had it seems pitch'd upon the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Osn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>burgh,</HI> his Majesty's Brother, to be one of the Godfathers, as being the true <HI>Parain, viz.</HI> the next of Kin; after the King himself (as I suppose) intended the Lord <HI>Cham∣berlain</HI> of the Houshold, <HI>viz.</HI> the Duke of <HI>New∣castle,</HI> to represent him; and as his Royal Highness expresses it (in one of the Letters, which it is said he wrote to the King) <HI>if those Copies we see in Print are Genuine,</HI> he was made to believe that the King appeared easie in the Choice he had made.</P>
<P>But when the Ceremony came to be perform'd, the Duke of <HI>Newcastle</HI> stood Godfather with the King, not as Proxy, or representing the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> but for himself in his own Name and Person. This the Prince says in the same Letters (if genuine as above) he thought an unaccountable Hardship, and there is no doubt his Royal Highness made some Steps to have prevented or avoided it as a Hardship; at least while he thought there was room for it, and while he might imagine that it was not
<PB N="182" REF="447"/>
a Thing so fix'd as he afterwards found it to be <HI>But the same Letters tell us, that</HI> as soon as his Royal Highness found that his Majesty thought proper to command it: He submitted.</P>
<P>Had his Royal Highness thought fit to have stop'd here, perhaps all had been well; but as he took it extremely ill from the Duke of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> it seems as if his Royal Highness must be persuaded that the said Duke had taken some steps in it of himself, or other than his Majesty's Command oblig'd him to because the Words <HI>in those Letters,</HI> this Treat∣ment of the Duke, and as it is in the French, <HI>this Proceeding</HI> of the Duke of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> immediately follows.</P>
<P>It seems therefore to me, that the Prince resented <HI>the Proceedings</HI> of the Duke, not as he acted in O∣bedience to his Majesty's Command, but as if the Duke had done something which he was not com∣manded, or at least seem'd officious to do in the Matter; I do not take upon me to say, or so much as to suggest, that the Duke did so, but 'tis evi∣dent the Prince seem'd to understand it so; and therefore in the Paper mentioned before, which is publish'd as his Royal Highness's Letter, <HI>supposing only</HI> they may be the Prince's Words, <Q>he says, “This <HI>Proceeding</HI> touch'd his Royal Highness sen∣sibly, and so far rais'd his Indignation, as that” he could not help shewing it.</Q></P>
<P>It remains to relate how his Royal Highness shew'd his Indignation to the Duke on this Occasion, and this indeed is rather to be buried in Silence, then recorded to Posterity, I mean as to the Parti∣cular, because of the unhappy Consequences: It suffices then to say, that his Royal Highness seeing the Duke after the Ceremony was over, spoke some
<PB N="183" REF="448"/>
warm Words to him, shewing his Resentment at what he had done.</P>
<P>This, as I heard, being reported to the King, his Majesty has been pleased to take in a quite different Manner, from what I have supposed the Prince in∣tended it: <HI>Note,</HI> as you go on, I do not say the King took these Things in a different Manner from what they were design'd or intended to be under∣stood, but different from that which I have sup∣posed to be the intent; for in this I go only upon the supposition of their being intended as is menti∣oned in the said Letters, and still supposing, tho' not undertaking to say, that those Letters are Genuine.</P>
<P>Upon the Report of the Words, his Majesty thought fit to give a sudden Mark of his dis∣pleasure by some Commands to the Prince, con∣fining his Royal Highness to his own Apartment, till his Majesty's farther Pleasure was known; to which his Royal Highness immediately sub∣mitted.</P>
<P>Soon after this, his Majesty's farther Plea∣sure was signified to the Prince, <HI>viz.</HI> That he should leave St. <HI>James</HI>'s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I need say no more.</P>
<P>Accordingly his Royal Highness quitted the Pa∣lace, the Princess going along with him, but not the Children, and retir'd to the Lord <HI>Gran∣tham</HI>'s House.</P>
<P>The Parliament was now Sitting, and the King's Speech mention'd above lay before them, and the main Thing that they entred upon the Debate of, was that Part which relates to the reducing the Troops: In this Case several extraordinary Speeches were made, and among the rest, one
<PB N="184" REF="449"/>
by <HI>Shippen,</HI> a Northern Member, who using a distasteful Freedom of Speech, was call'd to the Bar, and committed to the <HI>Tower;</HI> the Words which the House resented were these, <HI>viz. That the second Part of the King's Speech seem'd rather to be calculated for the Meridian of</HI> Germany, <HI>than</HI> Great-Britain; <HI>That the King is a Stranger to our Language and Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>Upon these Words, the House immediately cal∣led him to the Bar: In a Word, they were warm∣ly resented, and no Room being left for Extenua∣tions or Explanations, at least none offering that were sufficient, it was insisted, that Mr. <HI>Shippen</HI> be Committed to the <HI>Tower:</HI> The committing was oppos'd by many Members, Friends to Mr. <HI>Ship∣pen,</HI> and occasioned a long Debate, which lasted till Eleven a Clock, when it was carried to send Mr. <HI>Shippen</HI> to the <HI>Tower,</HI> by a great Majority, being 171 against 84. Accordingly, the next Day he was committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> where he still remains, having, as we hear, been very much indispos'd there, and as some say, dangerously ill.</P>
<P>Upon this Committing Mr. <HI>Shippen,</HI> some Mem∣bers mov'd that the Words which gave Offence might be printed, which was resolv'd, and accor∣dingly they were made publick; that the Vote of the House for committing is thus express'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That the said Words <HI>are highly dishonourable to, and unjustly reflecting on, His Majesty's Person and Go∣vernment.</HI></P>
<P>After this the House went on with the Debate, and after a long Struggle, the Court carry'd it, that the standing Forces upon the Establishment for <HI>Great-Britain</HI> should be 16347 effective Men, including Officers.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="450"/>
The Number of Men being thus Resolv'd on, the House immediately voted the Money for their Sup∣port for one Year, which amounted to <HI>681618 l.</HI> not including in this Establishment the Garrisons and Troops beyond the Seas; such as those in our Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> which amounted to</P>

<P>This Struggle about the Army being over, the House of Commons fell upon a long Debate about lowering the Interest of Money, and regulating the Value of our Coin. As to the first of these it was pass'd over for this Session, but the last enga∣ged the whole House in a great Labyrinth of Dis∣pute. The State of our Coin at that time admits this brief Description: Our Coin consisted of Cop∣per, Silver, Gold; the Copper Coin is at a low Ebb for want of Quantity, and it is to be rectified, or the deficiency to be supplied by renewing the Species only, and encreasing the Quantity; to which
<PB N="186" REF="451"/>
purpose several Orders have been issued, and the Me∣tal in sufficient Quantity being now provided, it is expected we shall in a little while have a full Sup∣ply of Halfpence and Farthings, which are indeed greatly wanted for common Occasions in Petty-Pay∣ments, and the lowest Part of Commerce. It seems there has been some defect or delay in this Matter; and some have publish'd, that the Metal was bad which was furnished for this Work; but as others again have contradicted the Report, and promised a speedy Production; we wait with as much Satisfa∣ction as other People, the compleating that Work.</P>
<P>The next Species is the Gold, of which there was no want; but on the other hand it is alledged, that our Guinea going at One Pound One Shilling Six Pence is more than the Gold is worth, as it ought to go; as it seem'd we have some inequality con∣cerning the rate of Gold in other Parts (as they stood proportioned to the rate of Silver Coin in those Parts) to the rate of Gold and Silver here.</P>
<P>This made the rate of our Gold Coin appear too high, and the rate of our Silver Coin appear too low; and the House taking this into Conside∣ration, tho' without much Debate, resolv'd to re∣duce the rate of Guineas to Twenty One Shillings each, and other <HI>British</HI> Gold Coin in proportion. This being resolv'd in the House, the Method was next enquir'd into, which was concluded to be, not by Act of Parliament; but by addressing his Maje∣sty to Issue out his Proclamation for it, which was done.</P>
<PB N="187" REF="452"/>
<Q><P>By the King, A Proclamation, Declaring the Rates at which Gold shall be current in Payments.</P>
<P>GEORGER.</P>
<P><HI>WHereas the Value of the Gold, compared with the Value of the Silver in the current Coins of this Realm, as Paid and Received, is grea∣ter in Proportion than the Value of Gold is to the Value of Silver in the Neighbouring Nations; and the Over-valuation of Gold in the current Coins of this Realm hath been a great Cause of carrying out and lessening the Species of the Silver Coins there∣of, which is highly Prejudicial to the Trade of this Kingdom: And whereas the Commons in Parlia∣ment have by their Address humbly besought Us, That we would be Graciously Pleased to Issue Our Royal Proclamation, to forbid all Persons to utter or Receive any of the Pieces of Gold, called Guineas, at any greater or higher Rate than one and twenty Shillings for each Guinea, and so proportionably for any greater or lesser Pieces of Coined Gold; Which We have Graciously Condescended unto. Now for and towards Remedying the said Evil, We have thought fit, with the Advice of Our Privy-Council, to Issue this Our Royal Proclamation, hereby strictly Prohibiting all and every Person and Persons what∣soever to Utter or Receive any of the Pieces of Gold Coin of this Kingdom, commonly called Guineas (which in our Mint were Coined only at Twenty Shil∣lings each, but have been by Our Subjects Paid and Re∣ceived at the Rate of one and twenty Shillings and Six Pence each) at any greater or higher Rate or Value than one and twenty Shillings for each Guinea, and so proportionably for the Pieces of Gold, called Half-Guineas, Double-Guineas, and five Pound</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="453"/>
<HI>Pieces; And the other Pieces of Ancient Gold Coin of this Kingdom, which by their Wearing may be Diminished in their Weight, at any greater or higher Rate or Value than as followeth, That is to say, The Piece of Gold now Received and Paid for three and twenty Shillings and Six Pence, to be hereafter Re∣ceived and Paid for Three and twenty Shillings, and no more; The Piece of Gold now Received and Paid for Five and twenty Shillings and Six Pence, to be hereafter Received and Paid for Five and twenty Shillings, and no more; and so proportionably for smaller Pieces of the like Gold Coin: At which Rates and Values, We do hereby Declare the said respective Pieces of Coined Gold to be Current. And we do hereby strictly Charge and Command all Our Loving Subjects whatsoever, that they do not presume to Receive or Pay the Gold Coins of this Realm at any greater Rates or Values than the Rates and Values aforesaid, upon Pain of Our highest Dis∣pleasure, and upon Pain of the greatest Punishment that by Law may be inflicted upon them for their Default, Negligence, and Contempt in this Behalf.</HI></P>
<P>Given at Our Court at St. <HI>James</HI>'s the Twenty second Day of <HI>December,</HI> 1717. In the Fourth Year of Our Reign.</P>
<P><HI>God Save the KING.</HI></P></Q>
<P>There was a Rumour, that the Value of the Sil∣ver Coin would be raised in Proportion to what the Gold had fallen; but this had a sudden Influence upon Trade, which was very near being fatal to us, <HI>viz.</HI> That on a sudden, all the Silver Coin disap∣pear'd, and People were put to the greatest Incon∣venience

imaginable to carry on petty Trade, for no ready Money was to be seen but Gold.</P>
<P>This oblig'd the Parliament, when they came together again, to pass a Vote, that they would not alter the Value of Silver Coin, and this in a few Months brought the Money out again.</P>
<P>As the Difference between the King and the Prince grew rather wider every Day than other, and no Prospect appear'd of its being reconcil'd or made up, the Prince removed from the Lord <HI>Grantham</HI>'s, and bought himself a House in <HI>Leicester-Fields,</HI> former∣ly the Dwelling-house of <HI>Seymour Portman,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a private Gentleman, but of an immense Wealth, and we since find his Royal Highness has adjoin'd <HI>Leicester-House</HI> to it; so that together he will have a large handsome Palace: As to his Summer Residence, he has fix'd upon a House near <HI>Richmond,</HI> the same that the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> formerly liv'd in, where his whole Family, his Children excepted, who were always kept at Court, were very well ac∣commodated.</P>
<P>His Royal Highness had before this written se∣veral Letters to the King, which it was hop'd would, with the Intercession of those who wish'd well to both Sides, have prevail'd; but these not being sa∣tisfactory, the Family settled as above, and our Hi∣story will not have the Felicity to relate the End of this Breach, at least not in this Part of it.</P>
<P>It was in Prosecution of this Difference between the King and the Prince, that the King thought fit to cause himself to be made capable of being nomi∣nated Governour of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, a Tran∣saction very particular and remarkable; the brief Hi∣story of the Fact I shall relate, as to the Reasons and Designs of it, that I have no Room for, or ra∣ther no Inclination to run the Risque of the Enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="455"/>
The Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> had, ever since the coming of King <HI>George</HI> to the Crown, been Governor of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company: The first Governor, who was the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> having thought fit to lay down, and having also unqualified himself by sel∣ing out his Stock, from being any more elected, the Company made their Court to the Prince, and as it is necessary by the Constitution of the Company, that whoever is Governor of the Company, must be entituled to Ten Thousand Pounds Original Stock, the Company in their first Transports, were pleased to compliment the Prince with such an Article of Stock, in order in the next Place to chuse him their Governor.</P>
<P>Upon the late unhappy Misunderstanding be∣tween the King and the Prince, and the latter being under the King's Displeasure so far as to be banished, or removed rather from his Majesty's Councils and Presence, the Company was given to understand that the King was become a Proprietor of their Stock; his Majesty it seems had transferred to him in his own Name, and accordingly had Credit in the Com∣pany's Books for above Ten Thousand Pound Stock. This was Intimation sufficient to the Company, that his Majesty might, if he pleased to accept of it, be nam'd their Governor. I do not at all pretend to say, that this Stock was purchased in order to such an Election; but if it may be said to seem to be so, it must also be allowed to seem to be on the Companies side, that if the King did them the Ho∣nour to become a Proprietor of their Stock, they could not but think it their Duty to name his Ma∣jesty as Governor of the Company; not to do this, had been indeed to have made the King, so far as he was a Member of the Company, a Subject to whoever should be the Company's Governor; and
<PB N="191" REF="456"/>
on the other Hand, if the Prince continued in the Post of Governor, as but on this Occasion was likely e∣nough, this would be to make the Prince Governor over the King, and the Son Governor over the Fa∣ther; I mean at least as far as concern'd their share in the Stock of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company.</P>
<P>This being the Situation of the Company's Af∣fairs, they agreed upon an Address to the King, to desire his Majesty would do them the Honour to use his Name as Governor of the Company in their en∣suing Election; this was the last Day of the last Month, and accordingly the Address being drawn up, and approved in the usual Form, and the Per∣sons nominated who were to go up with it, <Q>on <HI>Sa∣turday</HI> the first of <HI>February,</HI> “a considerable Number of the Principal Proprietors in the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Com∣pany waited on his Majesty at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, and be∣ing introduc'd by his Grace the Duke of <HI>Newca∣stle,</HI> Lord Chamberlain, presented the following Address to his Majesty. They were all admitted to kiss his Majesty's Hand, and his Majesty was pleased to confer the Honour of Kinghthood on” <HI>George Caswell</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></Q></P>
<Q>To the King's most Excellent Majesty.</Q>
<P><Q>“THE General Court of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, crave Leave to acknowledge, with the greatest Sense of Gratitude, the many Marks of your Roy∣al Favour, which the Company have received ever since your Majesty's happy Accession to the Crown; and in particular, the Honour done them in be∣coming” a Proprietor in their Stock.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“They therefore do, in the most humble and du∣tiful Manner, beseech your Majesty will be
<PB N="192" REF="457"/>
graciously pleased to grant them the farther Honour of using your Royal Name for their” Governor in the ensuing Election.</Q></P>
<P>His Majesty's most Gracious Answer.</P>
<P>Gentlemen,</P>
<P><Q>I <HI>Thank you for this Address, and take this as a</HI> “<HI>Mark of your Duty and Affection to me: 'Tis a very great Satisfaction to me, that I have had it in my Power to do you Good; and you may depend upon the Continuance of my Favour and Protection</HI>” <HI>upon all Occasions.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The King having thus accepted their offer, was on the 4th unanimously Elected their Governor, an Act of Parliament having pass'd the Houses for that Purpose, and having receiv'd the Royal Assent the Day before. It seems there were some Reasons in the Nature of the Royal Sovereignty of the King's Person, or as a reserve to the Dignity of the Throne, which required that a Law on purpose should be made, before Subjects could in any Case be said to elect their Sovereign to be their Governor, who was in all Cases their supreme Governor before in Right of the Royal Prerogative: But whether this was all the Reason or not, I do not pretend to determine; but it is certain such an Act was necessary, and therefore was previously concerted, and having pass'd through both Houses in two Days time, was pass'd by the King on <HI>Feb.</HI> 3. and the King declared Go∣vernor the next Day.</P>
<P>Now tho' the Election of Governor was car∣ried, as is said, unanimously, yet this Affair could not but create some Fractions, we are loth to say Factions, tho' if we should go that length, the ill
<PB N="193" REF="458"/>
Conduct of some People among them might ex∣cuse it.</P>
<P>The Disputes among them seem'd to be managed in the Election of their new People, such as the Sub-Governor, Deputy-Governor, and Directors for the coming Year; but the Reason and Cause of those Things pointed higher a great deal: Sir <HI>James Bate∣man</HI> had distinguished himself in the Prince's Interest on many Occasions, and more particularly in this of the Governor of the Company: It was said for Ex∣ample, That he did not deliver the Prince's Surren∣der of the Office of Governor in the Manner, and at the Time they ought to have had it. That he ad∣journ'd the General Court in an irregular Manner, and when Business of Moment was before them. And in a Word, That he thwarted the Design of ha∣ving the King be address'd and elected Governor of the Company, as much as he could.</P>
<P>This disgusted a great many of the Members of the General Court, and immediately a Party was form'd against Sir <HI>James,</HI> viz. To set up another against him in the Election for a Sub-Governor, which was to be the same Day that the King was to be declar'd Governor.</P>
<P>To oppose Sir <HI>James,</HI> the new Party made a Meeting at the <HI>Crown</HI> Tavern behind the <HI>Exchange,</HI> mustred all their Friends, told Noses, and, as all Factions do, flatter'd themselves they were strong∣er than they were, and set up Sir <HI>Theo. J—n</HI> against Sir <HI>James:</HI> As there was no Comparison in the Interest, so neither was there in the Merit of the Persons: The one a Purse-proud Foreigner, full of popular Notions, and long practised in Riding the Rabble of Parties, wise to a Degree that few envies, and wiser much in his own Opinion than in other Mens.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="459"/>
Sir <HI>James</HI> could not have desir'd a better Adver∣sary, not only for the just Character of the Person, but because he was of a Temper himself, and join'd with a Party who generally push'd their Projects not so much by the Knowledge of their Strength, as the Warmth of their Passions; not making a Judg∣ment so much by the Solidity of Calculations, as the Presumption of their Party; For this Image they set up was so unfit to make an Idol of, that it appear'd, in the Event, he had not Merit enough to be made a—Step to it: He was so far from having Interest enough to be made a Sub-Gover∣nour, that he could not get in to be made a Dire∣ctor; so he walk'd off: Like a certain Draper, who being set up at his own Request to be chosen Common-Council-Man, was sent back to his Parish to serve Scavinger and Constable.</P>
<P>In a Word, after much Clubbing and Caballing, much Huff and Bluster, on one Side or other, Sir <HI>James</HI> was, by a Majority of some Hundreds, chosen Sub-Governor, and Mr. <HI>Samuel Shepheard</HI> Deputy-Governour of the Company, the same Day that the King was Nominated, <HI>I am loth to call it Elected,</HI> Governor.</P>
<P>The like Struggle was made by the same Party a few Days after in choosing Directors; but the new Dividers lost their Cause, by a vast Majority.</P>
<P>The Directors being chosen and declar'd, a Ge∣neral Court was call'd the <HI>8th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> in which they had little offer'd but to make themselves Friends with one another again, after all these Squab∣bles; this however they did very well, by joining in with a Motion for an Address of Thanks to <HI>His Majesty,</HI> for the Honour done them in accepting the being their Governour; which was done, and pre∣sented
<PB N="195" REF="460"/>
to the King by the new Governour and Di∣rectors; at which time another of the Directors was dubb'd a Knight, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Jacob Jacobson.</HI> I have heard Mr. <HI>Shepheard,</HI> the Deputy-Governour, was intended for that Honour, but that he made his Escape. The Address and Answer is as follows:</P>
<P><HI>To the KING's most Excellent Majesty.</HI></P>
<P><Q>“THE General Court of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Com∣pany do, in the most humble and dutiful Manner, return their unfeigned Thanks to Your Majesty for Your most Gracious Answer to their late Address, and for Your great Condescension in permitting them, at their late Election, to use Your Royal Name for their Governour; the just Sense whereof they have endeavour'd to ex∣press by their entire Unanimity in the said Ele∣ction: And do most humbly beseech Your Ma∣jesty will be Graciously pleased to accept of being their Governour; and they do most sincerely assure Your Majesty, that they will constantly exert themselves in demonstrating their Duty and Affe∣ction to Your Majesty; and never cease their ser∣vent Prayers that Your Majesty's Reign may be” long, easie, and prosperous.</Q></P>
<P><HI>By Order of the General Court,</HI></P>
<P>James Bateman, <HI>Sub-Governour.</HI></P>
<P>Samuel Shepheard, <HI>Deputy-Governour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 8. 1717.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="461"/>
His Majesty's most Gracious Answer.</P>
<P>Gentlemen,</P>
<P><Q>“I <HI>Thank you for this repeated Instance of your</HI>” <HI>Duty and Affection to me, and accept of this Mark of it as you Desire.</HI></Q> <HI>I am glad of this Oc∣casion of assuring you again of my Favour and Pro∣tection.</HI></P>
<P>Thus this <HI>South-Sea</HI> Storm blew over, and things began to run in the former Channel; the Stock∣jobbers made the best they cou'd of the Bargain, and pretended to raise the Stock on the great Pro∣spect of this new Favour; as if some particular Advantage more than the Honour of having the King to their Governour had been in view: What that Advantage may be, we yet cannot say, but Time may discover it.</P>
<P>After this unhappy Court-Breach had thus taken Root, the young Prince who had been, tho' invo∣luntarily, the Occasion of his Father's Misfortunes, was removed by that Fate, which doubtless deter∣min'd his short stay to be fruitful of that remarka∣ble Event: Upon the Death of the Child, the Bo∣dy was open'd by the Surgeons, who made the fol∣lowing Report.</P>
<P><Q>“IN opening the Corps of his Highness Prince <HI>George William,</HI> we found a great Quantity of Water in the Head, lodged between the <HI>Pia∣mater</HI> and Brain, all the Substance of the Brain softer than usual, and the Ventricles fuller of Wa∣ter.”</Q></P>
<P><Q>“All the Entrails of the Lower Belly were in good Condition. In the Breast, we found the
<PB N="197" REF="462"/>
”lowermost part of the left Lobe of the Lungs in∣flam'd, and in cutting it, a small Quantity of pu∣rulent Matter issu'd.</Q> The lowermost part of the right Lobe was also inflam'd, but without puru∣lent Matter.</P>
<P><Q>“In the Heart there was a great Polypus in each Ventricle, which had Branches in all the Blood” Vessels, and hinder'd Circulation.</Q></P>
<P>The Funeral of this Prince was private; it was appointed the <HI>12th,</HI> when the Corps was deposi∣ted in the Royal Vault, under the Chapel of King <HI>Henry</HI> VII. in <HI>Westminster-Abby,</HI> with the following Inscription:</P>
<LG>

<HEAD>DEPOSITED.</HEAD>
<L>Prince <HI>George-William</HI></L>
<L>Son of the most Serene Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI></L>
<L>Born the <HI>3d</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> 1717.</L>
<L>Died the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> 1717-18.</L>
</LG>
<P>The Dean of <HI>Westminster,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rochester,</HI> perform'd the Office, and read the Service at the Interment; the Direction of the whole Funeral being ordered by the Lord Chamberlain, <HI>viz.</HI> the Duke of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> his famous Godfather. Upon
<PB N="198" REF="463"/>
which it has been wittily observ'd, that the Lord Chamberlain had the Honour to introduce the Prince twice into the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> once into the Bosom of it, and once into the Bowels of it.</P>
<P>The House of Commons was all this while sitting, and among the rest of their Transactions, this was not the least significant, <HI>viz.</HI> The selling the for∣feited Estates, in which they met with great Diffi∣culties, especially in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as has been said; and therefore it was necessary to bring in a Bill for the empowering the Commissioners to Sell absolutely, without any Reserve or Appeal, after all Claims that were come in had been adjusted, and a reasona∣ble Time given for bringing in more.</P>
<P>But now they met with an Interruption of ano∣ther Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> the Petitions of the miserable Fa∣milies who were Reduc'd by this Misfortune, lying at their Feet for Bread; and these being to be re∣fer'd by the House to the King, in the Course of Things his Majesty refer'd it back to the House by Message, intimating, that the King had nothing to object, if the House pleas'd to grant any Relief to the distress'd Families that petition'd.</P>
<P>The first of these was the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> whose whole Estate being seiz'd, he had not the least Subsistence for himself and Children; and the King gave a favourable Answer, referring him to the House of Commons, ordering it to be signify'd to the House, That he will not obstruct their Cha∣rity, or decline granting any Thing the House shall think fit to do in it; and when his Lordship Peti∣tion'd the House, Mr. Comptroller acquainted them. That he was commanded to acquaint the House with it accordingly: And we hear that <HI>700 l. per Annum</HI> has been allotted his Lordship,
<PB N="199" REF="464"/>
and to descend with some Limitation to his Poste∣rity.</P>
<P>The Petition of the Lord <HI>Widdrington</HI> was fol∣low'd by many more, <HI>viz. John</HI> and <HI>Henry Balfour, John Carstairs, Patrick Seaton, Rob. Rollo,</HI> late Lord <HI>Rollo,</HI> Lady <HI>Philippa Standish,</HI> Daughter to the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk, Margaret Thornton, Frances Dalton, Mary</HI> and <HI>Dorothy Hodgson, Anne Walton, Elizabeth Ibasto,</HI> and others. Upon these Petitions, and considering that many Petitions were expected to follow these, it was offer'd at by some, That a certain Part of the Estates of the forfeited Persons should be in his Majesty's Power, to dispose as his Royal Clemency might dictate, for the Re∣lief of their distressed Wives and Children. But the House would not agree to that neither; so what Petitions are not granted, will never be gran∣ted; nor will it be in the Power, even of the King himself to relieve Persons Petitioning afterwards, except out of his own Pocket.</P>
<P>The first of these Estates that was actually Sold, was the Lord <HI>Widdrington</HI>'s, being an Estate in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> valued at <HI>1460 l. per Annum,</HI> and bought by Sir <HI>Robert Chaplin;</HI> it was set up at <HI>26000 l.</HI> and sold by Inch of Candle or Auction for <HI>34500 l.</HI> being a very noble Estate, and well Wood∣ed: This Sale however was not made till <HI>Septem∣ber</HI> the following Year.</P>
<P>About this time most of the Parliament Business seem'd to give way a while to a long and warm Debate, upon the main Point so often mentioned be∣fore, about disbanding and reducing the Army.</P>
<P>The Dispute began under the Consideration of a Bill, entitul'd, <HI>For punishing Mutiny and Desertion, and better regulating the Forces.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="465"/>
The Sum of the Question was in two Parts; <HI>1st,</HI> About the Number of the Troops to be Esta∣blished, which however it had been debated and determined before, yet admitted some Debate now again, for those Gentlemen who were for the Redu∣ction of the Army, never gave it over, when they had any opportunity to take up the Argument.</P>
<P>But that being carry'd as far as it would go, they came <HI>2dly,</HI> To Laws for Government of the Sol∣diers, and the manner of Proceeding against them in capital Cases, which after several Reserves and Regulations, some in Favour of the Constitution, and some empowering the Civil Magistrate to act; at length a Law was settled for the Soldiery, such as it is, and the Heads of it were published by the King's Order, for preserving them in their Duty, which Rules however being pretty equally observed, the Soldiery take no great Advantage, and it being but for a Year also, I do not hear it complain'd on.</P>
<P>The Parliament being now in full Business, it is to my Purpose to give the Heads of their Proceed∣ings, particularly in what pass'd of Moment among them, and so bring the Session to a Close, that the Story may suffer no injurious Intervals.</P>
<P>The Coin came frequently before them, the Scarcity of Silver was an unsufferable Grievance in Trade, and made the People very uneasie, and the Noise of any one encreasing the Grievance made it still worst, yet one Case I may touch upon, and I have wondred often that no farther Occasion was taken at it among the common People, <HI>viz.</HI> That while both the Houses were severally imploy'd in finding out the Causes, as well as Remedies, for the lessening, and indeed the suddain vanishing of the Silver Coin of this Nation; some Suggestions were made, That
<PB N="201" REF="466"/>
a certain Cunning Worker in such convertible Spe∣cies, had turn'd Coin into Bullion to a prodigious Quantity, some talk, of above an Hundred Thou∣sand Ounces that were within the Compass of Dis∣covery, and that much more might be heard of.</P>
<P>If this had been found effectually out, and prov'd, one would have suppos'd the Houses need go no farther in that Part of the Enquiry which relates to finding out the Causes of the Decrease of our Coin; and therefore we suppose proper Means will one Time or other be still used to fix the Discovery, as no doubt the guilty Persons are diligent to con∣ceal it. I do not hereby say, however we may have been told, that the cunning Gamester was Sir <HI>Geo. Casw—l,</HI> or any other Person concern'd by or for him; but I leave it to the farther Enquiry of the Parliament, who, I hope, will do their Coun∣try Justice in a Proper Season.</P>
<P>The Abundance of Petitions which were coming from all Parts of the Kingdom for Remedy of this Mischief, but which were stop'd by finding the House enclined to go effectually upon it, may serve to give a Taste to any one of the great Grievance it was to the Publick to have such a suddain Scar∣city of the Species of Coin, that petty Commerce could hardly be carried on, and even Men that em∣ploy'd the Poor, were at a loss to pay their Wages. But what then will be the Anxiety of the People, and what the Damage to Trade, especially the Re∣tailer, which is that Part of Trade on which all the rest depends, when they shall find that the Houses either have not, or perhaps <HI>cannot</HI> find out effectual Remedies for the Mischief, we must leave to Time.</P>
<P>But I leave this as I find it, in some Confusion, and much Uncertainty, and proceed to another Case
<PB N="202" REF="467"/>
before the House of Commons, <HI>viz.</HI> That of the Demands of Foreign Princes upon <HI>Great Britain,</HI> for Arrears due to them for Subsidies or Quota's, agreed to be paid to them, to enable them to support the War, and for Pay of Troops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Sum the <HI>Dutch</HI> demanded was considerable; and his Majesty having promised them at their Request to recommend it to the Parliament, and having men∣tion'd it at the opening the Session, a State of the Demand was now ordered by the King's particular Direction to be laid before the House, and was up∣on the House's taking it into Consideration referred to the Commissioners, who were appointed to state, take, and determine the Debt due to the Army and Navy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in this Scituation I must leave it for the Present.</P>
<P>The Application to the House made by the Mer∣chants, and others, for the opening again the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI> Trade, was next in Course; where we are to note, that several Petitions had, previous to this, been presented to the House, from the Countrey Places where our Iron Manufactures are carried on, such as <HI>Birmingham, Sheffield, Newcastle,</HI> and others; inwhich they set forth the great Discouragements of their Trade, and the Difficulties they were put to in carrying on their Manufactures by the Prohibition of the Trade to <HI>Sweden;</HI> by which the Importation of Iron, which is the Product of that Country, was stop'd and interrupted, and without which they could not carry on their Trade.</P>
<P>Here, by the Way, I might enlarge upon the ma∣nifest Injury which Trading Nations always bring upon themselves, when, through the Necessity of their Affairs, or for any other Consideration, they are obliged to prohibit any Branches of their Fo∣reign Trade, whether it be of Importation or Ex∣portation,
<PB N="203" REF="468"/>
there being very few Countries so poor, so barren. so remote, but from whence something is to be fetch'd that we find wanting to our selves, and absolutely necessary for the carrying on our own Manufactures.</P>
<P>This was much the Case of our Commerce with <HI>Sweden,</HI> and which, as I suppose, occasioned these Petitions from the Iron Workers: If there were any private Reasons, or Agents employed to bring this on Foot with other Designs, that I have nothing to say to; but this above seemed to be acknowledged in the Consequences of the Thing; for that the Go∣vernment thought fit, a few Days after, to publish a Proclamation for the admitting the Importation of <HI>Swedish</HI> Iron, with this Limitation, <HI>viz.</HI> That it should not come directly from <HI>Sweden,</HI> but from o∣ther Places. This Proclamation, because it seems something particular and extraordinary, <HI>as to what followed especially,</HI> it is needful to insert here, and is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>It may be very profitably observ'd here, that this Difficulty in the Iron Trade, and the absolute De∣pendance, which we seem to have, on the Impor∣tation of <HI>Swedish</HI> Iron, and the Inconvenience which would always occur to our selves by any Prohibition, were the Reasons of State ever so just or so pressing: I say this Difficulty encourag'd, or rather reviv'd the Designs of some of our Enter∣prizing People for the making a Tryal of finding and improving the Mines of Iron, Copper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they had long been of the Opinion were to be found in the Colonies of the <HI>English,</HI> on the Continent of <HI>America.</HI> And accordingly several Petitions were presented to the House, in the Names of the Merchants, Shipwrights, Ironmongers, Smiths, and Dealers in Iron, and in the Iron Manu∣factury, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> from <HI>Bristol,</HI> and other Parts, praying that Encouragement may be given to those who are willing to engage in erecting Iron Works in his Majesty's Colonies in <HI>Virginia, Mary∣land, Pensilvania,</HI> and <HI>New-England.</HI> This Peti∣tion had an Appearance of Improvement, and was sufficient in its self to recommend it to the House,
<PB N="207" REF="472"/>
so a Committee was appointed to enquire into it, to see what Encouragement the Petitioners de∣sir'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this Month will scarce give us the Result of their Considerations on that Head, so we must leave it with them till we hear farther.</P>
<P>Whether these Things were a Concert with the same Persons who applied themselves afterwards in the <HI>Swedish</HI> Affair, as if the first having miscarri∣ed of the Design, was therefore the Reason of the other, <HI>I know not;</HI> but some Days after this, there appear'd several Petitions in more express Terms, to desire the Prohibition of the Trade to <HI>Sweden</HI> might be taken off, or to that Purpose.</P>
<P>This was call'd by the following Title, <HI>viz.</HI> A Petition of several Merchants and Owners of Shipping, in behalf of themselves and others, tra∣ding to and from <HI>Sweden;</HI> the Prayer of the Peti∣tion was in short, That the present Circumstances of the Trade to <HI>Sweden</HI> might be taken into Confi∣deration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Consequence of this Petition, the Mer∣chants on every side were brought into the House, and what they had to say was heard fully; also the <HI>British</HI> Resident, Mr. <HI>Jackson,</HI> was heard re∣specting the Memorial, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> presented to the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI> Court; and the Merchants, who complain'd of Losses and Captures of Ships by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> were also heard.</P>
<P>After this the Arguments for restoring and open∣ing the Trade on one hand, and the Reasons for continuing the Prohibition, till Satisfaction was obtain'd for the Losses of the Merchants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were also debated at large, but upon the whole, the Com∣mons did not think fit to resolve to take off the Prohibition of the <HI>Swedish</HI> Trade; so that Matter stands just as it did.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="473"/>
We are told, That it was warmly debated in these Cases, whether the <HI>Dutch</HI> had done us Justice in the Affair of prohibiting Commerce with <HI>Swe∣den</HI> or not, and the Papers were call'd for by the House, which pass'd between the Secretary of State here, and his Majesty's Resident in <HI>Holland;</HI> and the Letters from the said Resident in <HI>Holland,</HI> back to the Secretary of State; as also a Memorial deliver'd by the said Resident in <HI>Holland</HI> to the States General, on the Subject of the <HI>Dutch</HI> pro∣hibiting Commerce with <HI>Sweden;</HI> which, by the way, they never had done, whatever Reasons we had to expect they would.</P>
<P>But as no Resolutions were made upon these Debates, I can say little more than this, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> had not done what we expected, and the House did not think fit, however, to take off the Prohibition on our Side, and in this Posture it stands for the present.</P>
<P>About this Time, to make a short Digression, a Truce was made with the Emperor of <HI>Morocco,</HI> which, as it relates to Trade, I think may well be call'd an Affair of the Administration at home; the Reason and Negotiation of this Truce may be too tedious to enter into here, but the Truce itself is material, especially because it afterwards broke out into a War, and is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><Q>“I. It is consented and agreed upon, that there be a firm and inviolable Truce between the most serene and potent Prince, <HI>George,</HI> King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> &amp;c. and the most powerful and noble Prince <HI>Maley Ismael,</HI> &amp;c. for Three Months from the Date hereof; and between the Dominions and Subjects, Ships and Imbarkations of both Nati∣ons; and during the said Term no Injury shall
<PB N="209" REF="474"/>
be offered from one to the other by Word or Deed; but on the contrary they shall treat one the other” with all possible Respect and Friendship.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>“II. That all the Ships, or any Imbarkations whatsoever, as well those which belong to his Britannick Majesty and his Subjects, as those which belong to the Emperor of <HI>Morocco</HI> and his Vassals, shall pass the Seas freely, and without the least Molestation, shewing their Colours to each other. And if either one or the other shall order their Boat aboard, there shall not go in her above two Persons besides those that Row, and those two only, shall be permitted to go on board the other Ship: And when they are satis∣fied that the major Part of the Ships Company are Subjects either of one or the other Prince, they shall permit them to pass without any Mo∣lestation; as also all Passengers, Money or Mer∣chandize, that shall belong to any Nation what∣soever, and shall be found on board the said Ships or Imbarkations, shall be intirely free, neither shall they be subject to be taken, detained, or plundered, nor shall one or the other receive any” Damage or Injury.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><Q>“III. It is farther agreed upon, that during the Term of the said Truce, no Ship or Imbarkation, either of the one or the other Part, or any of their Subjects that shall be shipwreck'd on the Coast of the Dominions of either the one or the other Prince, shall be made Prize; neither shall their Goods be taken, or ersons made Slaves. But this Truce does not take off the Prohibition of Commerce; but the same is to remain in full” Force, to the Conclusion of the general Peace.</Q></P>

Concluded at <HI>Tetuan,</HI> on the Second of <HI>January,</HI> 1717-18, O. S. which answers to the Tenth of” the Moon of <HI>Safar,</HI> in the Year 1130.</P>
<P><HI>Coningby Norbury</HI> (L. S.)</P>
<P><HI>Bashaw Hamed,</HI> &amp;c. (L. S.)</P>
<P>This put some End for a Time to the Rovers of <HI>Sallee,</HI> tho' they soon broke out again: But the Irruption of our <HI>West-Indian</HI> Pirates grew still worse and worse, nor will the Limits of this Hi∣story extend to bring us an Account of any Abate∣ment of their Rapine and Violence, but rather the Encrease of it.</P>
<P>It is certain, that this wicked Insurrection was begun by <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and even now, the greatest Part of the Pyrates are <HI>English,</HI> tho' a great many <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Martinico</HI> have join'd them at several times since, and some Run-away Negroes also from <HI>Jamaica.</HI> Their first Irruption was from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but in private, and they never came to any con∣siderable Head, till some People, tempted by Pro∣fit, robb'd the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had recover'd part of the Treasure of the Galleons lost in the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and finding that being return'd to <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> they could not be protected there, but that upon the Application to the Government there, they would be prosecuted, and perhaps hang'd, they took to Sea again, and have committed since that, the most unnatural Violences against their own Coun∣try that ever Pyrates did, for they have chiefly di∣rected their Robberies against the Ships and Mer∣chants of their own Nation.</P>
<P>The House of Commons, upon the Petition and Representation of the Merchants, took this Part in∣to Consideration, and ordered an Account to
<PB N="211" REF="476"/>
be given them of what Men of War are already in those Parts, in order (as I suppose) to consider what other Ships to send thither; and the King, we are told, has Commission'd Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> the same, who, as it is said of Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> gir∣dled the World, and took the Ships from <HI>Acapulco.</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Rogers</HI> was now commission'd to go in Search of those Robbers; and has taken with him three Men of War; and that he may make use of all the possible Methods for reducing them, carries the King's Proclamation of Pardon to those who will return to their Duty.</P>
<P>What Success this Gentleman will meet with, or what other Remedies may be applied by the Par∣liament for this Evil, I cannot yet see; but I fear this Wound will not be so soon healed as all the Friends to Trade desire.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> arm against them as well as we; and indeed the Usage which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> give them is very just, whether it will intimidate and terrify them, or harden and make them desperate, we cannot answer: But the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have spar'd none that have fallen into their Hands. One Crew of Sixty Seven they took by meer Fighting, and tyed the Men Back to Back, and threw them all into the Sea. Another Vessel they fir'd, and when the Men leap'd into the Sea to avoid the Fire, refused to save any one of them. And a third that they took, they cut them all to Pieces, refusing to give them any Quarter. Nor are the Pyrates behind hand with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they serve in the very same Manner.</P>
<P>As for our Part, we do not hear yet of any of 'em that have fallen into the Hands of the <HI>British</HI> Government except one Ship, which was cast away in <HI>New-England;</HI> of the Men, one hundred and
<PB N="212" REF="477"/>
ten were drown'd, and only Six sav'd, Five of which Six were hang'd, and the Sixth proving that he was taken by the Pirates; and was only a Prisoner on board, and not engag'd with them, was sav'd.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they do a World of Mischief, and every Post or Express from the Islands or Conti∣nent, brings us Account of Ships and Men taken, murder'd, or plunder'd by them; among which, the <HI>South Sea Company</HI> have the Misfortune to lose a stout Ship, and very Rich, coming home from <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> which besides other Goods, had as they report, Four hundred thousand Pieces of Eight on board, the Men having, it seems, fought the Pyrates a good while, were, when they were forc'd to yield, all murder'd to a Man; and that which is still more, the Pirates have by this means gotten a stout Man of War, able to carry, as they write, 44 Guns.</P>
<P>Since this we have an Account, that the Pyrates cruize among the Islands openly, so that no Ship can stir; and in particular, the Islands of <HI>Nevis</HI> and <HI>Antegoa</HI> are, as it were, block'd up with them, and reduc'd thereby to the utmost Distress for want of Provisions.</P>
<P>People have entertained some Hopes that the new Governour of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> Sir <HI>Nicholas Laws,</HI> who is lately enter'd upon his Government, and is a Person in particular acquainted with the Affairs and Inte∣rests of those Parts, having resided Forty Years in that Island, will be able to direct to some Methods, how to reduce these desperate People, either by fair or foul means, to their Duty; and I hear he is par∣ticularly instructed for that purpose.</P>
<P>But I return to the Parliament, who were now drawing towards a Close of their Session; abundance of Bills had pass'd thro' their Hands, which lay in
<PB N="213" REF="478"/>
the House of Lords for the Royal Assent, so many, that the House of Commons having little Business, were oblig'd to adjourn for some Time, to give the Lords Time to go thro' the Work that was before them: In this Interval They voted to give the Bank of <HI>England</HI> Notice, that they would redeem and pay off the Sum of <HI>76803 l. 15 s. per Annum,</HI> pay∣able to the said Bank for circulating Exchequer Bills; this was done, and the Notice order'd to be given the Bank, pursuant to a Contract with the Bank, that they should have a Year's Notice, before such Sums were to be paid off.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd, that upon this Notice, the Stocks fell immediately Two or Three <HI>per Cent.</HI> which by the way, is a Testimony of the preposte∣rous Principles of Stock-Jobbing, <HI>viz.</HI> that they should value their publick Stocks and Funds at less than before, upon an Occasion, which in it self, manifestly tends to Raising and Establishing the Publick Credit, upon which all their Funds depend; but that is by the way, for this is not the only visible Contradiction that is to be found in <HI>Stock-Jobbing.</HI></P>
<P>The same <HI>17th</HI> Day of the Month, when the Speaker made this Report, the King sent the fol∣lowing Message to the House, a Message which, as it seem'd to imply the using a greater Strength than was intended in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> gave many People new Ideas of the Situation of Affairs between the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and Us; nor did the Notions of a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> which many People appre∣hended as the Consequence of these things add at all to the rise of our Stock. The Message is as follows:</P>
<PB N="214" REF="479"/>
<P>GEORGE R.</P>
<P><HI>HIS Majesty being at present engaged in seve∣ral Negociations of the utmost Concern to the Welfare of these Kingdoms, and the Tranquillity of</HI> Europe; <HI>and having lately received Information from Abroad, which makes Him judge that it will give Weight to His Endeavours if a Naval Force be employed where it shall be necessary, does think fit to acquaint this House therewith; not doubting, but that in case He should be obliged, at this Critical Juncture, to exceed the Number of Men granted this Year for the Sea-Servite, the House will at their next Meeting provide for such Exceeding.</HI></P>
<P>The House readily complied with this Demand as most Reasonable, and immediately Voted an hum∣ble Address, to signify their Resolution to make good such Exceedings of Men for the Service of the Current Year, as his Majesty shall find necessa∣ry, adding their humble Compliment of Thanks for his Majesty's unwearied Endeavours for the Wel∣fare of his People, and to preserve the Tranquillity of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The King returned his Thanks in Answer to this Address, which was afterwards repeated at the Close of the Sessions: Of which in its Place.</P>
<P>And now all publick Business being finished, at least so much as could be expected for that Time; the King came to the House the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>March,</HI> and making a Speech to them, prorogued them to the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>May.</HI> The King's Speech was as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P>I <HI>Cannot put an End to this Session, without re∣turning my hearty Thanks to so good a <HI>Parlia∣ment,</HI>
<PB N="215" REF="480"/>
for the Dispatch which has been given to the publick Business. You will, I hope, in your private Capacities, feel the Convenience of an early Recess; and I am persuaded, the Publick will receive great Benefit by the seasonable Zeal and Vigour of your Resolutions in Support of my Government.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nothing can add so much to the Credit and Influence of this Crown, both at home and abroad, as the re∣peated Instances of your Affection to me. This Stea∣diness and Resolution of yours, will, I hope, enable me to procure, against our next Meeting, such Trea∣ties to be concluded, as will settle Peace and Tran∣quillity among our Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If, through the Blessing of God, my Endcavours to this End prove successful, I shall have the Satis∣faction to silence even those who will never own them∣selves convinc'd; and to let all the World see plain∣ly, that what I have most at Heart, is the Good and Welfare of my People, who may then be eased in their Taxes, and enriched by their Trade.</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</P>
<P><HI>I must return you my particular Thanks for the Supplies you have so cheerfully granted, and for the late Instance of your Confidence in me. I promise you, that my Endeavours shall not be wanting to make use of both to the best Advantage, for the Good of my People.</HI></P>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>The Practices which are daily used by a most rest∣less and unhappy Set of Men, to disturb a Govern∣ment, by whose Clemency they are protected, require our utmost Attention and Vigilance. I must there∣fore recommend it to you, that in your several Sta∣tions and Countries, you will endeavour to quell that</HI>
<PB N="216" REF="481"/>
<HI>Spirit of Disaffection, which our common Enemies are so industrious to foment.</HI></P>

<Q><P>Then the Lord Chancellor, by his Majesty's Command, said,</P>
<P>My Lords and Gentlemen,</P>
<P><HI>HIS Majesty's Royal Will and Pleasure is, that that this Parliament be Prorogued to</HI> Tuesday <HI>the Twentieth Day of</HI> May <HI>next, to be then here</HI>
<PB N="219" REF="484"/>
<HI>held; and this Parliament is accordingly prorogued to to</HI> Tuesday <HI>the Twentieth Day of</HI> May <HI>next,</HI></P></Q>
<P>The King as soon as the Parliament was gone Home, removed with the whole Court to <HI>Kinsing∣ton;</HI> publick Business began to take a Recess, the Preparations for fitting out a strong Squadron of Men of War for the Mediterranean, went on with the utmost Vigor, as the Thing which the Eyes of the whole Nation seem'd now to be bent upon.</P>
<P>It was about this time that the famous <HI>James Shepheard</HI> appeared upon the Stage, this was a Youth who has been the Astonishment of the World upon many Accounts, having without any View, or for ought that yet appears without any Support, any Accomplices or any Conspiracy, openly professt a fixt Resolution to assassinate The King, how he with a voluntary Boldness upon all Examination be∣fore at and after his Tryal declared it, yielded to Death, courted no Favour, ask'd no Mercy, and with an unmov'd Courage look'd Death in the Face to the last Gasp, tho' all Men know, not one can account for.</P>
<P>He was apprehended by a Clergyman, one Mr. <HI>Leak,</HI> a Nonjuror, to whom he conveyed a Letter, delaring his Intention to kill the King. Had he stopt here, and when he was carried before a Magistrate, put his Accuser upon Proofs of the Fact and of the Treason supposed, he had evidently baffled the Accuser; for Mr. <HI>Leak</HI> had burnt the Letter, had taken no Copy of it, nor could swear to the Contents. The Reason, it seems, which Mr. <HI>Leak</HI> gave for burning the Letter was, That not being at Home when the Letter was left, and see∣ing the Treasonable Nature of it, he was surpriz'd, and took it to be some villainous Whig Plot of some that had a Design upon his Life, who having left such a Letter in his House, would come again
<PB N="220" REF="485"/>
with Constables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to search his House on Pre∣tence of other Things, and so find this Paper there. But this was a weak Part in him too, for had he carried the Letter it self to the Justice of Peace, as he did an Account that he had received it, he had been right, and at the same time had been safe too; whereas, as it was circumstanced, he would cer∣tainly have been very much reflected on for burning the Letter, had not the Boy clear'd up all the Case by an unexampled Conduct.</P>
<P>For the Boy coming, as he had appointed, for an Answer to the Letter, was apprehended and car∣ried before a Magistrate of the City of <HI>London</HI> swhere he not only own'd the Letter, but the Trea, son contain'd in it, and offer'd to write it over∣again, which he did too in their Presence, setting his Hand to't, and thereby signing his own Destruction; declaring to them all, that his Intention was to kill the King, and that he believ'd the Action would be meritorious if he had executed it; Things which nothing but a Lunatick could, till this Creature ap∣pear'd, be supposed capable of.</P>
<P>It is too long to repeat all these Things as they pass'd in the several Examinations of this young Man, as well before the Justice, as before the Un∣der-Secretaries at the Secretaries Office, all which were repeated at his Tryal; but 'tis sufficient to say, he was the same every where, readily own'd all, and that he meant and intended it all, and would do it still if it were in his Power; and this he did, not only at those several Examinations, but even upon his Tryal, and to the last; offering nothing in his Defence, refusing to call any Wit∣nesses, but telling the Court he own'd every Thing that was depos'd by the Witnesses, and that he in∣tended and meant what he had written; and thus
<PB N="221" REF="486"/>
he receiv'd the Sentence of Death, shewing no more Concern than at his first Examination.</P>
<P>It was astonishing to see the Conduct of this Youth! What Assistants or Instructors he had been furnished with, to bring him to receive such Prin¦ciples, and to be so fix'd in them, as to contemn Punishment, and we may say, to court the Grave and the Gallows, is hard to determine; nor per∣haps, if any such are in Being, may they be even discover'd; for to press him to tell, who boldly defied Death, and took all upon himself at the Price of his Life, had been to do nothing.</P>
<P>But to come now to his Execution: It was thought by some, the nearer View of Death would perhaps move him, and that when he saw Death just before his Eyes he would relent: But they were deceiv'd who entertain'd such Notions if him; for no Man in the World, had his Cause been indisputably Good, could have brav'd Death it self, in a manner, more like a Christian and a Hero, and yet died a Murtherer; that is to say, intentionally so, and this, without the least yield∣ing the thing it self to be a Sin.</P>
<P>The same Day in the Morning that this Youth suffer'd, a remarkable Piece of Justice was executed upon an <HI>Italian</HI> Nobleman, the Marquiss <HI>de Pal∣leotti,</HI> Brother to the Dutchess of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> for killing his own Servant. The Murther committed was so barbarous, the Provocation so little, and the Conduct of the Person so scandalous, that the Government did not think fit to give him the Fa∣vour of a Person of Quality, <HI>viz.</HI> of being Be∣headed; but this was all he obtain'd, <HI>viz.</HI> to be Hang'd about Six a-Clock in the Morning, and to be buried afterwards in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Church-yard.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="487"/>
He made a short kind of Speech in <HI>Italian,</HI> and gave it to the Sheriff at the Place of Execution. As it was very short and significant in it self, so it was most ridiculously Translated into <HI>English,</HI> and yet because both are published, we must give them in the very Words they appear'd in: Any one that understands <HI>Italian</HI> will see the Difference. They are as follow:</P>
<Q><P>A True Copy of the Paper delivered by <HI>Ferdinando</HI> Marquiss of <HI>Palleotti,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>PER scarica della mia Conscienza &amp; acio che niscere altro sia Sospetato del facto per cui jo sono condemnato confesso che ne la ma collera diedi un stuccato al infelica mio Servitor chiado per dono a quel che mi hanno condannato a morte, &amp; a tuto il mondo che dio sia Miserecordioso al anima mi un dichiare Di Morire Catholico Romano par novesse lusanza del mis Poese di fore haringa ai luogni del supplicio sinisco pregando l' oratrone di tutti ifiacli.</HI></P></Q>
<P>That none should be accused or suspected of the Fact that I suffer for, I declare to all Mankind, I have killed my Man: I ask Pardon of God and all the World. I likewise declare to die a <HI>Roman Catholick:</HI> I beg the Prayers of all the Faithful The Use of making Speeches being not the Fa∣shion of my Country, I have no more to say,</P>
<P><HI>Palleotti.</HI></P>
<P>As now I draw near to that Part of the King's History which relates to Foreign Affairs, I must clear up such of the Transactions of the particular Year I am upon, as though relating to Foreign Af∣fairs, yet were managed at Home; and this in par∣ticular respects the Neutrality of <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Pro∣ceedings

of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> against the Domini∣ons of the Emperor in <HI>Italy,</HI> a Subject which will take up much Room in the future Story of the Reign of King <HI>George,</HI> as well as in the General History of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be questioned, but that upon the ap∣pearance of a Rupture between the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the Emperor, two Powers which bore so consi∣derable a Figure in <HI>Europe,</HI> the Neighbouring Po∣tentates would concern themselves to prevent the Consequences of such a Breach, and more particu∣larly the King of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> but it was for some Time not known by what Measures or Me∣thods his Majesty would think fit to act; the most that was to be gather'd, was from the King's Words to the Parliament, in the Speech mention'd above.</P>
<P>As for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> he having declined to accept of these Heads of Agreement, or of such o∣thers as are settled among the other Powers, suppo∣sing them to differ from these; the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has since entred in to such other Alliances and Conventions with the Emperour and <HI>France</HI> for the enforcing them; which Conventions and Alliances have been finished since the Conclusion of these An∣nals, as weshall perhaps see in a little Time: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> will be obliged to comply with.</P>
<P>I find little more of Consequence in the whole Four Years of this Reign, except what will come of Course to be spoken of again in the following Years as we go on; (as for Example) the End of that preposterous Fewd among the Clergy, I mean the Bishop of <HI>B</HI>—'s Adherents and Antagonists: This, I say, if ever it shall come to an End, may once for all be sum'd up in a general Head, containing the Source of the Quarrel, the scandalous Manner of
<PB N="224" REF="489"/>
carrying it on, the Parties to it on either or on every Side, the Consequences of it to themselves and others, and the End of it all, with an Account who had the Victory, and what has been gained or lost. All these, I say, may be taken Notice of under one Article at last, but to engage in it now, is but to leave it the same unfinished Broil, and the same Piece of Confusion that we find it.</P>
<P>There had been, as is observed before, a little Tu∣mult in the West of <HI>England</HI> among the Clot hiers which some of our Writers would willingly have made a Rebellion of if they could, but if fell at once as it began without much Design, a few of the most boysterous being taken hold of, were kept in Prison and brought to Tryal at the Lent Assizes this Year; the Issue of which was only this, that one <HI>Read</HI> the Leader or Ensign of the Mob was find 100 Nobles and Six Months Imprisonment, another of them 10 Nobles and Five Months Imprisonment, Four or Five other lesser Sums, from 30 to 15 No∣bles proportioned to their Guilt and their Capacities of Payment, and so that Affair ended.</P>
<P>One of the principal Things remaining and with which I shall close this History as to home Affairs, is the Account of the Lord <HI>Chancellor Cowper</HI> who now lay'd down the Seals, and of placing the Lord <HI>Parker</HI> in the Office of Lord High Chancellor of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Among the many Persons on whom the Eyes of the Government seem'd to be fix'd for this Employ, the Lord <HI>Parker,</HI> at that time Lord Chief Justice of the <HI>King's Bench,</HI> was found to be the only Person in view; yet some Difficulties being necessary to be adjusted in removing a Person seated in such a Post, as that of Lord Chief Justice of <HI>England,</HI> it was some time that we were uncertain whether his Lord∣ship
<PB N="225" REF="490"/>
would be the Man or no. At length, <HI>viz.</HI> the 12th, we were put out of Doubt, the King gave the Seals to my Lord <HI>Parker,</HI> and he was declared Lord High Chancellor: What the Considerations by way of Equivalent were, on which his Lord∣ship quitted so advantagious and so established a Post as that of Lord Chief Justice, we cannot de∣termine, tho' great Sums were talked of; all we find visible is, that a Patent is said to be passed, or passing the Seals, to settle a Pension of <HI>1200 l. per Annum</HI> upon his Lordship's eldest Son; and it is added, that he is to have the Office of a Teller in the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> upon the first Vacancy.</P>
<P>His Lordship having received the Seals, it was the 15th, that he appeared for the first time in the <HI>Chancery</HI> Court at <HI>Westminster,</HI> whither he went in State and Ceremony, attended by a numerous Train of Nobility and Persons of the first Qua∣lity; his Lordship's new Officers were also appoint∣ed, as is usual in such Cases; the Names of them, as by the Lists that are made Publick, are as fol∣low: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>“Sir <HI>John Doyley</HI> of <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> Purse-bearer, and Mr. <HI>Fuller</HI> Deputy Purse-bearer. Mr. <HI>Peter Cottingham,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Secretary, and <HI>Christ. Duppa</HI> Deputy Secretary, <HI>Nicholas Rowe,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Secreta∣ry of the Presentations, <HI>John Hughes,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Se∣cretary of the Commissions of Peace,—<HI>Bark∣er,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Secretary of the Bankrupts, <HI>Tho. Parker,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Secretary of Lunacy, Ideocy, and Appeals, Mr. <HI>Butler</HI> Secretary of the Briess, <HI>Jonathan Johnson</HI> Secretary of the Decrees, <HI>William Oaker,</HI> one of the Gentlemen of the Chamber, Mr. <HI>Mason,</HI> his Lordship's Clerk, is continued in the same Em∣ployment” to the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Prat.</HI></Q></P>

<P>A Woman brought to Bed of a Child in <HI>Grace∣church-street,</HI> which had the Mark of the Eclipse of the Sun plainly figured on its Fore∣head; the Child lived but two Days.</P>
<P>A strange <HI>Phoenomenon</HI> in the Air, being Streams of Light from the <HI>North</HI> in the Evening, so bright as to represent a pale Light, equal to the set∣ting of the Sun; but this being a common Thing in the more Northern Climates, the Wonder of them did not merit so much Notice as we found some People willing to take of them.</P>
<P>A most furious Tempest of Wind so violent that next to the great Storm in Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign, the like had not been known in <HI>England</HI> in the Memory of Man.</P>
<P>A long Frist continuing from the End of <HI>No∣vember</HI> to the 9th of <HI>February,</HI> with some small In∣tervals, so that the <HI>Thames</HI> was frozen over for several Weeks together, Booths built upon it,
<PB N="229" REF="494"/>
and whole Oxen roasted upon the Ice in several Places.</P>
<P>A terrible Storm of Thunder, Lightning and Rain, in which abundance of People, Horses, Houses and Stacks of Corn were burnt with the Lightning.</P>
<P>An unheard-of Earthquake, with an Erup∣tion of fiery Mountains or Volcanoes at the Island of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> which has entirely destroyed the greatest Part of that Island; if not the Whole, the Parts of which blew up into the Air to so prodigious a Heighth, and with such Violence, that the Dust and Sand of it fell down in Show∣ers at <HI>Barbadoes, Martinico</HI> and other Islands, at the Distance of near an hundred Miles, to the great Surprize of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The like Earthquakes and Eruptions of Fire with dreadful openings of the Earth, happened at the same Time at the <HI>Terceras</HI> and <HI>Canaries</HI> Islands, to the Terror of the Inhabitants, many of whom were frighted to Death.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN King <HI>George</HI> came to the Crown he found the Nation just taking Breath after a tedious, wasting and bloody War; what∣ever Complaints were at home against it, and the Conditions of the Peace of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> the Man∣ner of making it, and the Persons employed in it, yet this Happiness accured to his Majesty by it, and of which all the Kingdom shared with him <HI>(viz.)</HI> that when Providence called the House of <HI>Hannover</HI> to the Succession, the Hands of all their Enemies were tied up by the very Peace which themselves had made,
<PB N="230" REF="495"/>
so that not the least Opposition was any where offered to the quiet Possession of the Crown at home or abroad.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France,</HI> the most potent Enemy to the Protestant Settlement, was engaged by Treaty and bound in Honour, not only not to oppose it, but even to contribute to the free and uninterrupted Accession, and accordingly ordered Monsieur <HI>Ibberville,</HI> his Minister at <HI>London,</HI> and the Marquess <HI>de Chasteauneuf,</HI> his Minister at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to signifie, the first to the Regency of <HI>London,</HI> and the other to the Ministers of <HI>Hannover</HI> and <HI>Great Britain</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> that his most Christian Ma∣jesty would offer his <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty no Di∣sturbance in his Accession to the Crown; and when his Majesty afterwards came to the <HI>Hague</HI> in his way to <HI>England,</HI> the same <HI>French</HI> Ambas∣sador waited on him, and in the Name of his Master, the most Christian King, congratulated his Accession, paid the Compliment as they cal∣led it of Febicitation, and gave him the same Assurances in Words at length; so in a Word the Peace of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> had stopped every Mouth, and tied every Hand from acting against the In∣terest and advancing of King <HI>George</HI> to the Throne, a Circumstance which in my Account would have atoned for abundance of the bad Things which otherwise, as they say, attended the Peace.</P>
<P>But the People of that Side shut their Eyes against this Part, nor did they abate any Thing of their Complaints against the Peace it self, any more than they did against the Persons who made it, as has been shewn in the forego∣ing Sheets.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="496"/>
As the whole World was thus at Peace with King <HI>George</HI> and his Accession, so King <HI>George</HI> evi∣dently desired to be at Peace with all the World, and it was his Majesty's Interest to be, consider∣ing the Temper of his People and Situation of his Affairs at Home; and without doubt it was with a View to this that the King so rea∣dily entered into a defensive Alliance with the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at a Time when some People here were not, for want of Ignorance, warm for renewing the War with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Of this Alliance, the Nature and Reason of it, I have given a large Account in the second Part of this History, Page 32, to which I refer.</P>
<P>From this to the Affairs of <HI>Spain</HI> our Admini∣stration has had little Concern; in the Affairs abroad, the World, though full of Intrigues and Embarrasses, had little or no War upon their Hands, except that in the second Year of the King a bloody War broke out between the Empe∣ror and the <HI>Turks,</HI> which indeed began in the Quarrel of the <HI>Venetians;</HI> for as to the War in the <HI>North,</HI> there was nothing done in it deser∣ving the Name of a War, except driving the <HI>Swedes</HI> to their close Quarters; for as to the at∣tacking them in their own Country, the Allies durst not venture upon it.</P>
<P>But the War with the <HI>Turks</HI> was carried on in earnest, and the very first Campaign Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Imperial</HI> Ar∣my, gave the <HI>Turks</HI> an entire Overthrow in the great Battle near <HI>Semlin,</HI> or rather at <HI>Peterwa∣radin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> where, if we may believe the Accounts which the <HI>Germans</HI> gave of it, they killed a∣bove <HI>26000 Turks,</HI> took all their Baggage and Carriages, all their Tents, Treasure, and 150
<PB N="232" REF="497"/>
Pieces of Canon, and after that passed the <HI>Da∣nube</HI> and the <HI>Theysse,</HI> and laid Siege to <HI>Temeswaer,</HI> which after a long Siege they took also, with all the District and Dependency of it, as far as <HI>Orsowa</HI> on the <HI>Danube</HI> one way, and as far as the River <HI>Alauta</HI> the other way, even a good way into the Country of <HI>Wallachia.</HI></P>
