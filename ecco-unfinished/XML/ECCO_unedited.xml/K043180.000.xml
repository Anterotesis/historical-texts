<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. PALMER.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>OUR Comic Bard, before whose roving eye</L>
<L>Kingdoms and States in magic vision lie,</L>
<L>Sweeps o'er the map, and with a partial smile</L>
<L>Fixes at length on his beloved Isle,</L>
<L>He views her deck'd in all her natural charms,</L>
<L>And wrapt in peace, amidst the din of arms.</L>
<L>"Here, here," he cries, "on ALBION's fostering breast,</L>
<L>"The Arts are shelter'd, and the Muses rest,</L>
<L>"Here I will build my stage, by moral rule</L>
<L>"And scenic measure here erect my school;</L>
<L>"A school for prejudice:—Oh! that my stroke</L>
<L>"Cou'd strip that creeper from the British Oak!</L>
<L>"Twin'd round his generous shaft, the tangled weed</L>
<L>"Sheds on the undergrowth it's baneful seed."</L>
<L>This said, he bids us strike the daring blow,</L>
<L>That lays his fame or this defiler low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now our PROLOGUE speaks—In former days</L>
<L>Prologues were abstracts of their several Plays;</L>
<L>But now, like guilty men, who dread their doom,</L>
<L>We talk of every thing but what's to come.</L>
<L>As for our Fable, little I'll unfold;</L>
<L>For out of little much cannot be told.</L>
<L>'Tis but one species in the wide extent</L>
<L>Of prejudice, at which our shaft is sent,</L>
<L>'Tis but this simple lesson of the heart—</L>
<L>Judge not the Man by his exterior part:</L>
<L>Virtue's strong root in every soil will grow,</L>
<L>Rich ores lie buried under piles of snow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If to your candour we appeal this night</L>
<L>For a poor Client, for a luckless Wight,</L>
<L>Whom Bard ne'er favour'd, whose sad fate has been</L>
<L>Never to share in one applauding scene,</L>
<L>In Souls like your's there should be found a place</L>
<L>For every Victim of unjust disgrace.</L>

<STAGE><HI>Sir</HI> STEPHEN BERTRAM, FREDERIC.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> STEPHEN BERTRAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY do you press me for reasons I'm not bound to give? If I chuse to dismiss an assistant clerk from my counting-house, how does it concern you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>That clerk you took at my recommenda∣tion and request; I am therefore interested to hope you have no reasons for dismissing him that affect his character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Step.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am your father, Sir, and in this house sole master; I have no partners to account to;
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
nor will I brook any comments on my conduct from my son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, as your son, may I not, without risquing your displeasure, offer one humble word upon the part of a defenceless absent friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Step.</SPEAKER>
<P>A friend!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I hope I need not blush to call Charles Ratcliffe friend. His virtues, his misfor∣tunes, his integrity, (you'll undeceive me if I err) have much endear'd him to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Step.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say rather his connections: Come, I see where all his friendship points—to folly, to disgrace—therefore no more of it! Break off! new friendships will not cost you dear; 'tis better you should cease to call him friend, than put it in his power to call you brother. In one word, Fre∣deric, I never will accept of Ratcliffe's sister as my daughter-in-law—nor, if I can prevent it, shall you so far forget youself as to make her your mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mistress! Good Heaven!—But I'll restrain myself.—You never saw Miss Ratcliffe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Step.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you never had—But you have seen your last of her, or me—I leave it to your choice.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FREDERIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no choice to make: she is my wife—and if to take beauty, virtue and elegance without fortune, when my father would have me take fortune without them, is a crime that merits dis∣inheritance, I must meet my punishment as I can. The only thing I dread is the severe but honorable
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
reproof of my friend Ratcliffe, to whom this mar∣riage is a secret, and whose distinterested resent∣ment I know not how to face: I must dissemble with him still, for I am unprepar'd with my de∣fence, and he is here.</P>
<STAGE>CHARLES RATCLIFFE <HI>enters.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well met, Frederic!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I could say so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? what's the matter now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no good news to tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't expect it, you are not made to be the bearer of good news; knavery engrosses all fortune's favor, and fools run up and down with the tidings of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are still a philosopher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell that till I am tried with pro∣sperity: it is that which sets our failings in full view, adversity conceals them.—But come, discuss: tell me in what one part of my composition the ingenious cruelty of Fortune can place another blow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my soul, Charles, I am asham'd to tell you, because the blow is now given by a hand I wish to reverence. You know the temper of Sir Stephen Bertram: he is my father, therefore I will not enlarge upon a subject, that would be painful to us both. It is with infinite regret I have seen you (nobly descended, and still more nobly en∣dow'd) earning a scanty maintenance at your desk in his counting-house: It is a slavery you are now releas'd from.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you; Sir Stephen has no fur∣ther commands for me. I will go to him, and de∣liver up my keys.</P>
<STAGE>[Going.</STAGE>

<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have patience for a moment.—Do you guess his reasons for this hasty measure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>What care I for his reasons, when I know they cannot touch my honor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Charles, my heart is penetrated with your situation! What will become of those beloved objects—?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what becomes of all the objects misery lays low? they shrink from sight, and are forgotten.—You know I will not hear you on this subject: 'twas not with my consent you ever knew there were such objects in existence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn it; but in this extremity methinks you might relax a little from that rigid honor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never; but as the body of a man is brac'd by winter, so is my resolution by adversity. On this point only we can differ. Why will my friend persist in urging it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done. You have your way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then with your leave I'll go to your father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! Here comes one that supersedes all other visitors—old Sheva, the rich Jew, the meerest muck-worm in the city of London: How the old Hebrew casts about for prodigals to snap at! I'll throw him out a bait for sport.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, let him pass: what sport can his in∣firmities afford?</P>
<STAGE>SHEVA <HI>the</HI> JEW <HI>enters.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>The good day to you, my young master! How is it with your health, I pray? Is your fader Sir Stephen Bertram, and my very good patron, to be spoken with?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, he is at home, and to be spoken with, under some precaution, Sheva: if you bring him money, you will be welcome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that is very goot. Monies is wel∣come every where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pass on, pass on! no more apologies—Good man of money, save your breath to count your guineas. <STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> SHEVA.</STAGE> That fellow wou'd not let his shadow fall upon the earth, if he cou'd help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too hard upon him. The thing is courteous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hang him! he'll bow for half a crown. His carcase and it's covering wou'd not coin into a ducat, yet he is a moving mine of wealth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see these characters with indignation; I contemplate them with pity. I have a fellow-feel∣ing for poor Sheva: he is as much in poverty as I am, only it is poverty of another species: He wants what he has, I have nothing and want every thing. Misers are not unuseful members of the community; they act like dams to rivers, hold up the stream that else wou'd run to waste, and make deep water where there wou'd be shallows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I recollect you was his rescuer; I did not know you were his advocate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true I snatch'd him out of jeopardy. My countrymen, with all their natural humanity, have no objection to the hustling of a Jew. The poor old creature was most roughly handled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was the cause?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never ask'd the cause: There was a hundred
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
upon one; that was cause enough for me to make myself a second to the party over-match'd. I got a few hard knocks, but I brought off my man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>The synagogue shou'd cannonize you for the deed.</P>
<STAGE>SHEVA <HI>returns.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aha! there is no business to be done; there is no talking to your fader. He is not just now in the sweetest of all possible tempers—Any thing, Mr. Bertram, wanted in my way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sheva, there is enough wanted in your way, but I doubt it is not in your will to do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do always do my utmost for my princi∣pals: I never spare my pains when business is going; be it ever such a trifle, I am thankful. Every little helps a poor man like me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>You speak of your spirit, I suppose, when you call yourself a poor man. All the world knows you roll in riches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world knows no great deal of me: I do not deny but my monies may roll a little, but for myself I do not roll at all. I live sparingly and labor hard, therefore I am called a miser—I cannot help it—an uncharitable dog, I must endure it—a blood-sucker, an extortioner, a Shylock—hard names, Mr. Frederic, but what can a poor Jew say in return, if a Christian chuses to abuse him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say nothing, but spend your money like a Christian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have no abiding place on earth, no country, no home: every body rails at us, every body flouts us, every body points us out for their
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
may-game and their mockery. If your play∣writers want a butt or a buffoon, or a knave to make sport of, out comes a Jew to be baited and buffetted through five long acts for the amusement of all good Christians—Cruel sport, merciless amuse∣ment! hard dealings for a poor stray sheep of the scatter'd flock of Abraham! How can you expect us to shew kindness, when we receive none?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(advancing)</STAGE>
<P>That is true, friend Sheva, I can witness; I am sorry to say there is too much justice in your complaint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless this goot light! I did not see you—'Tis my very good friend Mr. Ratcliffe, as I live. Give me your pardon, I pray you, sir, give me your pardon; I should be sorry to say in your hearing that there is no charity for the poor Jews. Truly, sir, I am under very great obligations to you for your generous protection t'other night, when I was mob'd and mal-treated, and, for aught I can tell, should have been massacred, had not you stood for∣ward in my defence. Truly, sir, I bear it very thank∣fully in my remembrance; truly I do, yes truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave me with him, Charles: I'll hold him in discourse whilst you go to my father.</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> CHARLES.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! it was goot deed, very goot deed, to save a poor Jew from a pitiless mob, and I am very very grateful to you, worthy Mr.—Ah! the gentleman is gone away: that is another thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so, but your gratitude need not go away at the same time; you are not bound to make good the proverb<HI>—"Out of sight, out of mind."</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no; I am very much oblig'd to him, not only for my life, but for the monies and the valuables I had about me: I had been hustled out of them all but for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, having so much gratitude for his favours, you have now an opportunity of mak∣ing some return to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, and I do make him a return of my thanks and goot wishes very heartily. What can a poor Jew say more? I do wish him all goot things, and give him all goot words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good words indeed! What are they to a man, who is cast naked upon the wide world, with a widow'd mother and a defenceless sister, who look up to him for their support?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good lack, good lack! I thought he was in occupations in your fader's counting-house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was, and from his scanty pittance piously supported those poor destitutes: that source is now stopp'd, and as you, when in the midst of rioters, was in want of a protector, so is he in the midst of his misfortunes in want of some kind friend to rescue him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear, oh dear! This world is full of sadness and of sorrow; miseries upon miseries; unfortunates by hundreds and thousands, and poor Sheva has but two weak eyes to find tears for them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Sheva, pity will not feed the hungry, nor clothe the naked. Ratcliffe is the friend of my heart: I am helpless in myself; my father, though just, is austere in the extreme;
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
I dare not resort to him for money, nor can I turn my thoughts to any other quarter for the loan of a small sum in this extremity, except to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>To me! goot lack, to me! What will be∣come of me? what will Sir Stephen say? He is full of monies; but then again he is a close man, very austere, as you say, and very just, but not very generous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, let me have your answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, but my answer will not please you without the monies: I shall be a Jewish dog, a baboon, an imp of Beelzebub, if I don't find the monies; and when my monies is all gone, what shall I be then? An ass, a fool, a jack-a-dandy! Oh dear! oh dear!—Well, there must be conditions, look you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure: security twice secur'd; pre∣mium and interest, and bond and judgment into the bargain: only enable me to preserve my friend, give me that transort, and I care not what I pay for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on your heart! What haste and hurry you are in. How much did you want? One hundred pounds, did you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>More than one, more than one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, poor Sheva! More than one hundred pounds! What! so much as two hundred? 'Tis a great deal of monies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, friend Sheva, at one word—three hundred pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercies defend me, what a sum!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accommodate me with three hundred
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
pounds; make your own terms; consult your con∣science in the bargain, and I will say you are a good fellow. Oh! Sheva, did you but know the luxury of relieving honor, innocence and beauty from distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! 'tis great luxury I dare say, else you wou'd not buy it at so high a price. Well, well, well! I have thought a little, and if you will come to my poor cabin in Duke's Place, you shall have the monies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, my gallant Sheva! Shall I bring a bond with me to fill up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no: we have all those in my shop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't doubt it—All the apparatus of an usurer <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>—Farewell, Sheva! be ready with your instruments, I care not what they are: only let me have the money, and you may proceed to dissection as soon after as you please.</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> FRED.</STAGE>
<STAGE>SHEVA <HI>alone.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Heigho! I cannot chuse but weep—Sheva, thou art a fool—Three hundred pounds by the day, how much is that in the year?—Oh dear, oh dear! I shall be ruin'd, starv'd, wasted to a watch-light. Bowels, you shall pinch for this: I'll not eat flesh this fortnight; I'll suck the air for nourishment; I'll feed upon the steam of an alderman's kitchen, as I put my nose down his area.—Well, well! but soft, a word, friend Sheva! Art thou not rich? monstrous rich, abominably rich? and yet thou livest on a crust—Be it so! thou dost stint thine appe∣tites to pamper thine affections; thou dost make
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
thyself to live in poverty, that the poor may live in plenty. Well, well! so long as thou art a miser only to thine own cost, thou may'st hug thyself in this poor habit, and set the world's contempt at naught.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unfeeling, heartless man, I've done with you. I'll dig, beg, perish, rather than submit to such unnatural terms—I may remain: my mother and my sister must be banish'd to a distance.—Why, this Jew, this usurer, this enemy to our faith, whose heart is in his bags, wou'd not have us'd me thus—I'll question him—Sheva!</P>

<P>And thou hast hoarded wealth, till thou art sick with gold even to plethory: thy bags run over with the spoils of usury; thy veins are glutted with the blood of prodigals and gamesters.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have enough: something perhaps to spare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I have nothing, nothing to spare but miseries, with which my measure overflows—by Heaven, it racks my soul, to think that those beloved sufferers should want, and this thing so abound <STAGE>[aside.]</STAGE>—Now, Sheva, now, if you and I were out of sight of man, benighted in some desart, wild as my thoughts, naked as my fortune, shou'd you not tremble?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shou'd I tremble for?—You cou'd not harm a poor defenceless aged man.</P>

<SPEAKER>ELIZA.</SPEAKER>
<P>OH! happy me, possess'd of all my heart de∣lights in; and miserable me, for having ruin'd what I love. Alas! poor Bertram, fond to despe∣ration, generous to thy destruction!—Why then did I marry, wherefore did I suffer him to be the vic∣tim of a fatal passion? What power perverted un∣derstanding, heart, humanity? What power but that, which can do all things, good or ill, make virtue and unmake it, animate our courage and ex∣tinguish it?—Love is at once my crime and my excuse. Good heavens! my mother.—</P>

<P>Eliza! Child! what means this more than usual agitation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it then more than usual?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>You weep—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I? 'Tis natural, when I contemplate face so dear and so decay'd, furrow'd with cares and sorrows for my sake.—Ah! my dear mother, you have lov'd me much too well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>My darling, can that be, seeing I love your brother also? You share my heart between you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give all to him: he has deserv'd it better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven bless him to the extent of his deservings! On him rests all our hope; to him we cling, as to the last dear relick of our wreck'd nobility. But he's a man, Eliza, and endow'd with strength and fortitude to struggle in the storm; we are weak helpless women, and can do no more than suffer and submit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, but there is a part allotted to the weakest, even to me; an humble one indeed, and easily perform'd, since nothing is requir'd but to obey, to love you and to honour you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have done it faithfully, my child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>You think so, my dear mother, but your praise is my reproach.—Oh! had I now a crime upon my conscience, and shou'd I kneel thus and beg for pardon at your feet, what wou'd you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Astonishment might keep me silent for a while, but my first words wou'd be to pity and forgive you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can err this guilty hand will wit∣ness.—Well may you start. That hand is Ber∣tram's; and that ring, pledg'd at the altar, was put on by him this very morning—I am Bertram's wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, quit this supplicating posture till you find yourself in presence of some person less dispos'd to pardon you than I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>How mild is that rebuke! how merciful! Your eye, like Nature's, penetrates my heart: you see it weak as woman's resolution is, empassion'd not impure, conquer'd but not corrupted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see myself reflected in my child: jus∣tice demands a censure; conscious recollection checks me from pronouncing it: but you have a brother, whose high-soaring spirit will not brook clandestine marriages: your husband has a father of another spirit as I fear. Alas! my child, be∣twixt the lofty and the low you must steer well to keep a steady course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see my danger; and tho' Bertram's ar∣dor painted it in fainter colours than it's true com∣plexion may demand, yet I shou'd hope the nature of a father cannot be so stern as never to forgive a choice that disappoints, but, let me hope, does not disgrace him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>The name of Ratcliffe cannot. A daughter of your house in better days wou'd hardly have advanc'd his knighthood higher than her foot-cloth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Madam, but the pride of birth does but add stings to poverty. We must forget those days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your father did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my father!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your brother never will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet he is humble for our sakes. Think what he does. Good heavens, my husband's father's clerk. Dear Madam, tell me why he did not rather go where his courage call'd him, where his
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
person wou'd have grac'd the colors that he carried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Child, child, what colors? Surely you forget the interdiction of a father barr'd him from that service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, alas!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>The bread wou'd choak him, that he earn'd under a father's curse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have bled for our opinions, and we have starv'd for them: the axe and sword and po∣verty have made sad havoc with our family: 'tis time we were at peace. The world is now before us: on this hour depends the fate of all perhaps that are to come. Frederic is with his father; he is determin'd to avow his marriage, and to meet the consequences. I never saw Sir Stephen, and have nothing but conjecture to direct me: I tremble for the event.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a distressful interim; and it is now the hour when I expect your brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that is worse than all; for pity's sake hide me from him till Frederic returns: let me retire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come then, my child! I know not what it is, but something whispers me that all will yet be well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten thousand blessings on you for that chearing hope: how my heart bounds to embrace it! 'Tis an auspicious omen, and I hail it like the voice of inspiration.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Jabal, I say Jabal! Where are you, sluggard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jabal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here am I, mother Dorcas! Oh! what a starving star was I born under, to be the rich Jew's poor servant. No rest, no peace whilst you are awake. Lud-a-mercy! if you did but know how your pipe echoes in this empty house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Child, child, you must not think to be idle here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jabal.</SPEAKER>
<P>What wou'd you have me do? Brush the bare walls for a breakfast? A spider could not make a meal upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant thou hast fill'd thy belly, cor∣morant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jabal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not had a belly-full since I belong'd to you. You take care there shall be no fire in the kitchen, master provides no prog upon the shelf, so between you both I have plenty of nothing but cold and hunger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hunger indeed! How shou'd thy sto∣mach ever be fill'd, when there is no bottom to it? 'tis like the Dead Sea, fathomless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jabal.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis like the Dead Sea so far, that neither fish nor flesh are to be found within it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sirrah! you have a better master than you think for. It is unknown the charities he gives away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jabal.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're right, it is unknown; at least I
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
never found the secret out. If it is charity to keep an empty cupboard, he has that to boast of; the very rats wou'd run away from such a caterer. If it is charity to clothe the naked, here is a sample of it: examine this old drab, you may count the threads without spectacles; a spider's web is a warm blanket to it. If it is charity to feed the hungry, I have an empty stomach at his service, to which his charity at this present moment would be very seasonable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must mortify your carnal appetities: how often shall I teach you that lesson?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jabal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every time I set eyes upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hav'n't you the credit of belonging to one of the richest men in the city of London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jabal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I was turnspit to the poorest cook's shop instead. Oh! if my master had but fixt his abode at Pye Corner, or Pudding-lane, or Fish∣street-hill, or any of those savory places!—What am I the fatter for the empty dignity of Duke's Place? I had rather be a miser's heir than a miser's servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who knows what may happen? Master has not a relation I ever heard of in the universal world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jabal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he has starv'd 'em all out. A ca∣meleon cou'd not live with him; he wou'd grudge him even the air he feeds on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, slanderer! His good deeds will shine out in time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jabal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shan't stand in their light; they may shine through me, for I am grown transparent in

his service.—Had not he like to have been torn to pieces t'other day by the mob for whipping a starv'd cat out of his area?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>And whose fault was that but thine, un∣gracious boy, for putting it there? I am sure I have cause to bless the gentleman that sav'd him.—But hush! Here comes my good master; and as I live the very gentleman with him—Ah! then I guess what is going forward.</P>

<P>Aha! I am tired. I beg your pardon, Mr. Ratcliffe; I am an old man. Sit you down, I pray you, sit you down, and we will talk a little. <STAGE>[DORCAS <HI>brings a glass of water]</HI></STAGE> So, so! that is right. Water is goot.—Fie upon you, Dorcas; why do you not offer the glass to my guest before me?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Dorcas.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord love him! I'd give him wine, if I had it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, it is goot water, it is better
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
than wine: wine is heating, water is cooling; wine costs monies, water comes for nothing—Your good health, Sir—Oh! 'tis delicious, it is satis∣fying: I was very empty before, my stomach was craving, now I am quite content.—Go your ways, Dorcas, go your ways.—<STAGE><HI>(Exit</HI> DORCAS.)</STAGE> Sir, I have nothing to ask you to but that water, which you wou'd not drink: 'twas very goot water not∣withstanding.—Ah! Mr. Ratcliffe, I must be very saving now; I must pinch close.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>For what? Are you not rich enough to al∣low yourself the common comforts of life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, oh yes! I am rich to be sure—Mercy on me, what a world of monies shou'd I now have, if I had no pity in my heart! But it melts and melts, or else—Oh! dear me, what a heap it wou'd have been!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, if I say there are some seem∣ing contradictions in your character, which I can∣not reconcile. You give away your money, it should seem, with the generosity of a prince, and I hear you lament over it in the language of a miser.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, that is very true: I love my monies, I do love them dearly; but I love my fellow-creatures a little better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Being so charitable to others, why then will you not spare a little to yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I am angry with myself for being such a baby, a child, a chicken. Your people do not love me, what business have I to love your people? I am a Jew; my fathers up to Abraham
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
all were Jews—Merciless mankind, how you have persecuted them! My family is all gone, it is ex∣tinct, my very name will vanish out of memory when I am dead—I pray you pardon me; I'm very old, and apt to weep; I pray you pardon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am more dispos'd to subscribe to your tears than to find fault with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, well! 'tis natural for me to weep when I reflect upon their sufferings and my own.—Sir, you shall know—but I won't tell you my sad story: you are young and tender-hearted—It is all written down—You shall find it with my papers at my death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!—At your death?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sure, I must die some time or other: tho' you have sav'd my life once, you cannot save it always: I did tell you, Mr. Ratcliffe, I wou'd shew you my heart. Sir, it is a heart to do you all possible good whilst I live, and to pay you the debt of gratitude when I die: I believe it is the only one I owe to the pure benevolence of my fellow-creatures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry you have found mankind so un∣grateful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so, not so; I might perhaps have found them grateful, if I had let them know their benefactor; I did relieve their wants, but I did not court their thanks: they did eat my bread, and hooted at me for a miser.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! to Miss Rateliffe? Is it so? And she is goot and lovely, but she has no monies; and that has made your fader very angry with you?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Furious, irreconcileable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why truly, monies is a good thing, and your fader is not the only man in England that does think so: I confess I'm very much of his mind in respect of monies.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you are; therefore keep your money, and good morning to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold, be not so hasty! If I do love my monies, it may be because I have it in my power to tender them to you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have said I never can repay you whilst you are in this world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I do not rightly understand you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten thousand pounds.</P>

<P>That is a goot round sum; but you did not love her, and you do love your wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>As dearly as you love your money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little better we will hope, for I do lend my monies to my friend.—For instance, take these bills, three hundred pounds—What ails you?—They are goot bills, they are bank—Oh! that
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
I had a sack full of them!—Come, come, I pray you take them. They will hire you very pretty lodging, and you will be very happy with your pretty wife—I pray you take them.—Why will you be so hard with a poor Jew as to refuse him a goot bargain, when you know he loves to lay his monies out to profit and advantage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you in earnest? You astonish me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a little astonish'd too, for I did never see a man so backward to take money: you are not like your fader. I am afraid you are a little proud.</P>

<P>Yes, of two equal fortunes I believe he wou'd be good enough to let me take my choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that is very kind; he wou'd give you the preference when he had none himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just so: but what acknowledgment shall I give you for these bills?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>None, none; I do acknowledge them myself with very great pleasures in serving you, and no small pains in parting from them. I pray you, make yourself and pretty wife comfortable with the monies, and I will comfort myself as well as I can without them—Ah, poor Sheva! when thou art beggar man, who will take pity of thee?—Well, well! no matter—now I must take a little walk about my business—I pray you pardon my unpoliteness.</P>

<P>Yes, and to all sheep and oxen, lambs and calves, for he will not suffer us to touch a morsel of their flesh. Now because he lives without food, that's no reason I shou'd starve for want of eating. Oh! Mother Dorcas, 'tis untold what terrible and abominable temptations I struggle with.</P>

<P>Where there is plenty of prog, be assur'd—I will go upon the stage and turn actor: there is a great many eating parts, and I hope to fill them all. I spent sixpence t'other night upon a farce, where there was a notable fine leg of lamb serv'd up before the audience. Oh how I did long to be the attorney! I won't say so many good things wou'd have come out of my mouth, but a pretty many more wou'd have gone into it.</P>

<P>CAN you forgive me? Has my lovely ad∣vocate sued out my pardon, and may I now invoke a blessing on my love and me?</P>

<P>Heaven in its bounty bless you both! May all good fortune follow you, all comforts light upon you, and love and happiness ever subsist be∣tween you!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>She does not know you are here. Shall I call her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not yet. I have a little sum, and you must be our banker: Charles is too proud to touch it; his spirit is of a pitch too high to stoop to worldly matters. We have been warm and cor∣dial friends, how we may fare as brothers, Heaven only knows: I have some fears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eliza is impressed with the same ap∣prehensions, but if Sir Stephen acquiesces; all will be well: I hope this money is a token of his for∣giveness.</P>

<P>Well; but you do not answer to my question of the money.—Hav'n't you seen your father?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he had said what wou'd have done him honor, and given ease to my Eliza's mother, I should not have waited for your question: But nature must have time to work. I have only stirr'd the dregs.—May I now see Eliza? There is a cloud on my heart also, which only her bright pre∣sence can dispel.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Frederic, what tidings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>None but of love, encreasing with each moment, glowing with every beam that those soft
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
eyes diffuse, and heighten'd into rapture by those charms, those graces, that each look, word, mo∣tion spread around you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are fond flattering words; but where's the consolation, that you wou'd have given me had you brought back a pardon from your father? This ardor only proves that you had too much love, and I too little generosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take courage, Eliza! I have not lost the field, only prolong'd the fight: I have but skir∣mish'd with him yet; he has not felt my strength. Let me set you in sight, and if there is a callous in his heart, (which I won't say there is) your eyes, my charmer, will refine and melt it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>My eyes have injur'd him too much al∣ready.—Oh! you rash man, why did you take such pains to be undone? Why lull me into dreams of happiness, till I forgot that I was poor and wretch∣ed? Deceiver of yourself and me, I thought we trode on flowers, and never spied the precipice be∣hind you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see no precipice; I fear none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me, my Frederic, let love stand off a while, and give your ear to reason.—'Tis fit that you should know the heart, for which you have risqu'd so much. Our marriage was a rash one; be that my witness how I lov'd you, for never till this day had I the recollection of one act, that weigh'd upon my conscience, or reproach'd me with the sin of disobedience in the slightest instance: But, though I wanted firmness to oppose your love, I am not void of courage to prevent your ruin.—
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
Have patience! hear me out—Sir Stephen Ber∣tram wish'd for money; I have none to give him, the fortune of my house is crush'd, the spirit yet survives, even in me, the weakest and perhaps the humblest of the name; but I resist contempt, and, if he spurns my poverty, I have a sure resource, that shall compel him to applaud my spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean? Your looks, your language terrify me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I have lov'd you far too well to trifle. I will convince the world 'twas not by in∣terest my heart was gain'd; 'twas not to keep off want, to live at ease, and make the noble relicks of my family retainers of his charity, I married to Sir Stephen Bertram's son; it was with worthier, purer views, to share his thoughts, unite my heart to his, and make his happiness my own: These sentiments are my inheritance; if these will not suffice for his ambition, they will teach me how to act becoming of my birth, under the imputation of his son's se∣ducer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hence with that word! It is a profanation to your lips. Was ever man so blest, so honor'd, so exalted as I am? If pride will not see it, if avarice cannot feel it, is that a reason why humility and gratitude shou'd not be blest in the enjoyment of it.</P>

<P>Am I? No, sure; you have seen this dress before. I have nothing new.</P>

<P>I can't say quite as much, for I have a new livelihood to seek: Sir Stephen has discarded me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! fie upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; the man is worldly wise, no more. He has a son, Eliza, and he has found out I have a sister. Who can blame him? Beauty is a danger∣ous thing when honor does not guard it. But I know what my Eliza is, and therefore, to confute suspicion, and put this careful merchant at his ease, we will cut short the question, and retire from London.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wretched Eliza, did I ever till this mo∣ment meet your embrace with coldness? Have I not lov'd you, heaven and earth, how much!—How then have I deserv'd to be dishonor'd by you, and to have my name stamp'd as the joint se∣ducer of a fond weak youth, who will have cause to execrate the hour when first he called me friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strike me not to the heart with your re∣proaches, but in pity hear me: I am not lightly-minded, not ignobly taught how to distinguish ho∣nor, for I am your sister, and have a saint, that does

not blush to call me daughter: She has pronounc'd my pardon.</P>

<P>She is all pity; sorrow has melted her fond heart to weakness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you then find no excuse for mine? What have I known but sorrow, except gratitude to you, and love to Frederic? Cannot you allow for a fond sorrow-melted heart in me as well as in my mother? You said but now that as a friend you lov'd him: I love him as a friend; but woman's friendship to your sex, when years, affections, sen∣timents so harmonize, as Frederic's with mine, how long will it retain its station in two hearts before it draws them closer, and unites them as you see?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>We'll have no more of this, Eliza. There is a weakness lurking at my heart, that warns me how I trust myself too far; you have made wreck of your own honor, wretched girl; I may still rescue mine.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> STEPHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Saunders, what news have you been able to collect of my undutiful son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not seen Mr. Bertram, but I am told he has settled himself in very handsome lodg∣ings, and is gone to remove his lady to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>His lady, do you call her? Can you find no fitter term? Where shou'd he get the means to settle? He was not furnish'd with them by me; who else will do it? If he attempts to raise money upon expectancies, be it at their peril, who are fools enough to trust him: No prudent man will be his bubble.—If I were sure that was his practice, I shou'd hold it matter of conscience to advertise against his debts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps there may be some persons in the world, who think you will not always hold out against an only son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let those persons smart for their opinion: they little know the feelings of an injur'd father; they cannot calculate my hopes, my disap∣pointments, my regret. He might have had a lady with an ample fortune: A wise without a shilling
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
is—but what avails complaint? Cou'd you learn nothing further who supplies him, who holds him up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear that he had money of your broker, Sheva.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>That must be false intelligence. He will as soon make gold by transmutation, as wring it from the gripe of that old usurer: No, no, Sheva is too wary, too much a Jew to help him with a shilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet I was so inform'd by his own servant Jabal. He says, Mr. Bertram came to old Sheva's house by appointment; that he overheard their whole conversation, in which your son very honorably stated the utter ruin your displeasure had brought upon him, and wou'd have refus'd the money, but that old Sheva forc'd it upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>It mocks all belief; it only proves that Sheva, the most inveterate miser in existence, has a fellow Jew for his servant, one of the com∣pletest liars in creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am apt to give him credit for the fact, notwithstanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then give me leave to say you have more faith than most men living: was I to give so much credit, Mr. Saunders, I shou'd soon stop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not quite so fixt in my persuasion of old Sheva's character as you are. In his dealings, all the world knows he is punctiliously honest; no man's character stands higher in the Alley; and his servant tells me, though he starves himself, he is secretly very charitable to others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, this you may believe, if you are dis∣posed to take one Jew's word for another Jew's character: I am obstinate against both; and if he has supplied the money, as I am sure it must be on usurious principles, as soon as ever I have the old miser in my reach I will wring either the truth from his lips, or the life out of his carcase.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Sir!—Before I welcome you within these doors, or suffer you to sit down in my pre∣sence, I demand to know explicitly, and without prevarication, if you have furnish'd my son with money secretly, and without my leave?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I do lend, ought I not to lend in se∣cret? If I do not ask your leave, Sir Stephen, may I not dispose of my own monies according to my own liking? But if it is a crime, I do wish to ask you who is my accuser? that, I believe, is justice every where, and in your happy country I do think it is law likewise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir, you shall have both law and justice. The information comes from your own servant Jabal. Can you controvert it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do presume to say my servant ought not to report his master's secrets; but I will not say he has not spoken the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you confess the fact—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>I humbly think there is no call for that: you have the information from my foot-boy—I do not deny it.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the sum—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not talk of the sum, Sir Stephen, that is not my practice; neither, under favor, is my foot-boy my cashier. If he be a knave, and listen at my key-hole, the more shame his: I am not in the fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the fault! Wretch, miser, usurer! you never yet let loose a single guinea from your gripe, but with a view of doubling it at the return. I know you what you are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! 'tis more than I will say of my∣self.—I pray you, goot Sir Stephen, take a little time to know my heart, before you rob me of my reputation. I am a Jew, a poor defenceless Jew; that is enough to make me miser, usurer—Alas! I cannot help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter: you are caught in your own trap: I tell you now my son is ruin'd, disinherited, undone. One consolation is that you have lost your money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that be a consolation, you are very

welcome to it. If my monies are lost, my motives are not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll never pay one farthing of his debts; he has offended me for life; refus'd a lady with ten thousand pounds, and married a poor miss without a doit.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do understand your son is mar∣ried.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you so? By the same token I under▪ you to be a villain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aha! that is a very bad word—villain. I did never think to hear that word from one, who says he knows me. I pray you now permit me to speak to you a word or two in my own defence. I have done great deal of business for you, Sir Stephen; have put a pretty deal of monies in your pocket by my pains and labors: I did never wrong you of one sixpence in my life: I was content with my lawful commission.—How can I be a villain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not uphold the son against the fa∣ther?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do uphold the son, but not against the fader; it is not natural to suppose the oppressor and the fader one and the same person.

<P>You are pleas'd to be facetious, but your irony will not put me by from telling you that your son's connection with my family is no match of my making. If my sister has dishonor'd herself, it behoves me to say, and to say it on my solemn word, that the whole transaction was kept perfectly secret from me, and has receiv'd every mark of my displeasure and resentment, that I have as yet had an opportunity to give it.</P>

<P>You are very high, Sir; I am afraid your unexpected good fortune has rather intoxicated you.</P>

<P>No, Sir; the best good fortune I have known this day, was that which discharg'd me from your connection, not this, which unwillingly imposes it upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Mr. Ratcliffe! It was not with this sort of conversation I was prepar'd to en∣tertain you; the sooner we put an end to it the better: Only this I must take leave to tell you, that the fortune of the family, into which your sister has married, is by no means overbalanc'd by the fortune she has brought into it.</P>

<P>Well, sir, I can be silent, but I cannot forget—And now if you will come and share my grateful meal, perhaps I can shew you one of the loveliest objects in creation, a beautiful and amiable young bride, who with her husband and mother is now my lodger. She was married this very morn∣ing to your friend Sir Stephen Bertram's son, who, between you and me, has brought himself into sad trouble with his father by the match.

<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may well conceive, Mr. Ratcliffe, with what repugnance I oppose myself to you on this occasion. Whether the event be fatal to you or to myself, small consolation will be left for the survivor. The course you take is warranted by every rule of honor, and you act no otherwise than as I expected: but as my expression justifies your challenge, so did your provocation justify my ex∣pression; and your language being addressed to a lady, whom I have the honor to protect, it is not in my power to retract one tittle of what I said; for, was you to repeat the same insult, I should fol∣low it with the same retort.</P>

<P>I will speak plainly to you, and the rather as I am now perhaps speaking to you for the last time.—Admitted by your sister's favor into a family, whose representative resents her conduct, I will not so disgrace her choice in your eyes, who have op∣pos'd it, as to submit in the first instance to the most distant hint at an apology.</P>

<P>What? let me ask. I know of no be∣quest.</P>

<P>I am loth to think Sir Stephen Bertram can descend to ridicule my poverty: that I shou'd be regarded by you as an unwelcome intruder upon your family I can well believe; that you wou'd point your whole resentment against me alone, and spare your son, is all that I dare wish at present: my future hope aspires no higher than by perseve∣rance in my duty as a wife to merit your opinion, so as in time you may acknowledge me as your
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
daughter. Conscious that I have incurr'd your dis∣pleasure, I shall patiently endeavour to soften it by submission and obedience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, that answer is at once so paci∣fying and so candid, that if the information I have had of your being possess'd of ten thousand pounds for your fortune, be salse, tho' I thought I had pretty strong evidence of it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!—I'm sure your son, I'm sure my brother never told you this.</P>

<P>No, I'll engage for them they wou'd dis∣dain so gross and palpable a deceit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, be it as it may, with or without a fortune, portion'd or pennyless, I feel myself so irresistibly impell'd to open my arms to you as a father, that whether Sheva has or has not deceiv'd me, I here deposit my resentment, and by what I experience of your power over my heart, most thoroughly acquit my son for having surrender'd his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the impulse of your own generosity; not any impression of my giving, that moves your heart to pity and forgiveness.—But who is Sheva, that you seem to point at as the author of this falsehood?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sheva the Jew—Surely you know the man.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not quite that, tho' bad enough to be
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
so treated, if he has practis'd this deceit on me. Sheva is my broker, your husband knows him well, a miserly methodical old Alley drudge, who shew'd me what I believ'd a true receipt for ten thousand pounds vested in your name in the funds—One of my people wou'd have persuaded me it was his own voluntary benefaction—but if you don't know him, never saw him, never heard his name, the thing's impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>Totally so, without one ray of probabi∣lity: the man is either mad or mischievous: no Jew of that or any other name do I know; nay, I question if I ever exchang'd a word with any one of the nation in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your merit then, and not your fortune, shall endear you to me. I will strike out ten thou∣sand pounds, that I perceive you are not possess'd of, and write in ten thousand graces, which I perceive you are possess'd of, and so balance the account.—Now, Saunders, what's the matter?</P>

<P>Don't speak of joy too soon: t'will overthrow my senses—Let me survey you both. Don't deceive me; you have wounds about you—Ah! Charles, what's this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>The least, but luckiest wound that ever man receiv'd: this little glance of your brave hus∣band's sword disarm'd me of my weapon, and both our rash hearts of their anger. Now lay aside your fears, and prepare yourself for wonders.</P>

<P>Oh! my dear madam, I have joy to give you—Let me present you to my Frederic's father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, madam; and the greatest joy that son ever conferr'd upon me is the title he has given me to claim a father's share with you in this angel of a daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such she has been to me. I am blest to hear you say that you approve her.</P>

<P>Frederic, give me your hand—If you had brought me half the Indies with a wife, I shou'd not have join'd your hand to her's with such sincere delight.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the man—My benefactor; your's, Eliza; Frederic's; your's, dear mother; all man∣kind's: The widow's friend, the orphan's father, the poor man's protector, the universal philan∣thropist.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir, 'tis now too late to cover your good deeds: You have long mask'd your charities beneath this humble seeming, and shrunk back from actions princes might have gloried in: You must now face the world, and transfer the blush from your own cheeks to their's, whom prejudice had taught to scorn you. For your single sake we must reform our hearts, and inspire them with candor towards your whole nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough, Enough! more than enough—I pray you spare me: I am not used to hear the voice of praise, and it oppresses me: I shou'd not know myself, if you were to describe me; I have a register within, in which these merits are not

noted. Simply I am an honest man, no more; fair in my dealings, as my good patron here, I hope, can witness.—That lady, I believe, is Mrs. Ratcliffe: She does not know me: I will not touch upon a melancholy subject, else I cou'd tell a story—Merciful Heaven! what horrors was I snatch'd from by her husband, now, alas! no more!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, gracious Powers!—The Jew of Cadiz—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very same—your debtor in no less a sum than all that I possess, the earnings of a life preserv'd first by your husband, and now again by your son. Why am I prais'd then, if I am merely honest, and discharge my debts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! now the mystery's solv'd. The ten thousand pounds were your's.—Give them to Rat∣cliffe; I will have nothing from fortune, where nature gives so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a noble speech—but monies does not lessen merit, at least not always, as I hope, for Mr. Ratcliffe's sake; for he is heir of all that I possess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can I say? My heart's too full for utterance. O Charles, the fortunes of your house revive; surely the blessed spirit of your de∣parted father now sympathizes in our joy. Re∣member, son, to whom you owe this happiness, and emulate his virtues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I forget to treat my fortune, as becomes the son of such a father, and the heir of such a be∣nefactor, your warning will be my condemnation.</P>

<P>That it will never be: the treasure that integrity has collected, cannot be better lodg'd than in the hands of honor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a mine of wealth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, goot Sir Stephen, it is not a mine, for it was never out of sight of those who search'd for it: the poor man did not dig to find it; and where I now bestow it, it will be found by him again. I do not bury it in a synagogue or any other costly pile; I do not waste it upon vanity or public works: I leave it to a charitable heir, and build my hospital in the human heart.</P>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Miss FARREN.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>TRUTH has declar'd, and question it none can▪</L>
<L>WOMAN was once a rib of Lordly MAN;</L>
<L>And some perhaps wou'd risque a little pain</L>
<L>To hitch that rib into its place again;</L>
<L>For let the heart-ache, or what aught betide,</L>
<L>They're sure to trace it to the peccant side,</L>
<L>Till fixt at length they centre all the blame</L>
<L>In that one rib, from whence the Woman came,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now this is downright prejudice and spleen,</L>
<L>A plea for thrusting us behind the scene;</L>
<L>And there we stood for many a long long age,</L>
<L>Not let to steal one foot upon the Stage,</L>
<L>Till now, when all their tyrant acts are past,</L>
<L>Curtsying we come, like EPILOGUE, at last;</L>
<L>And you so little are inclin'd to rout us,</L>
<L>You wonder how your fathers did without us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sure we can lightlier touch those feeling parts,</L>
<L>That twine about the region of your hearts;</L>
<L>Passion, that from the lips of Woman flows,</L>
<L>Warm to Man's soul with magic switness goes;</L>
<L>And tho' the sphere be small in which we move,</L>
<L>Great is the recompence when you approve.</L>
<L>Whilst Nature and your candour hold their course,</L>
<L>So long our Charter will remain in force;</L>
<L>Nor will you grudge the privilege you gave,</L>
<L>Till we forget to smile upon the Brave.</L>
<L>Still in the slipp'ry path, that brings us near</L>
<L>Forbidden precincts, we must tread with fear,</L>
<L>Does my weak cast in tragic pathos lie?</L>
<L>Why then so dismal, gentle Poet, why?</L>
<L>In mirth oft' times the nuptial knot I've ty'd,</L>
<L>But never was till now a Mourning Bride.</L>
<L>If to my share some moving speeches fall,</L>
<L>"Look in my face, and they'll not move at all."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, not to drop at once ELIZA'S stile,</L>
<L>One word in earnest, and without a smile—</L>
<L>Thro' all the characters of varied life,</L>
<L>All the fond casts of Parent, Child, or Wife,</L>
<L>What part soe'er our Author has assign'd,</L>
<L>To that we must conform with patient mind;</L>
<L>So at the Drama's close when we appear,</L>
<L>We may obtain a parting plaudit here.</L>
