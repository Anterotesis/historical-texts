<HEAD>THE Secret History OF THE <HI>White-Staff.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART II.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in the Close of the first Volume of this History, given the Readers some Ground to expect, the latter Part of the Account should, in process of Time, be publish'd, in order to per∣fect the <HI>Secret History</HI> of the Manage∣ment of Affairs, and of the Conduct of some late Ministers; and finding the general Satisfaction which the first Part
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
of this Work has given, Justice re∣quires that I should go on to finish the same.</P>
<P>Yet I cannot be said to go on where I left off, but it will be needful to give a brief Recapitulation of a Circum∣stance or two, which is but hinted lightly at in the first Part, in order to preserve the Connection of the Hi∣storical Relation of things, and, with the greater Clearness, to introduce the Matters which are behind.</P>
<P>In order to this, the Reader may please to recollect, that in <HI>Page</HI> the 19<HI>th</HI> of the former Part of this History, these Words are to be found; <Q>“”We are to note, that when the Victory of the <HI>White-Staff</HI> was, to outward Appearance, compleat, and the dis∣plac'd Party seem'd, even by their own Confession, to have nothing left to do but to despair; then was the real Conflict greater than ever, and he had a greater Difficulty to withhold the Rage of those who were for using their Advantages with Rigour, and entirely crushing, ru∣ining, and oppressing those whom he had reduced, than he had had before either to reduce them, or to preserve himself.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<Q>“”The <HI>Staff</HI> had hitherto proceeded with a steady Resolution to maintain the Authority and Power he posses∣sed, and had, as before, successfully frustrated and disappointed all the Measures of those who would have overthrown and pulled him down: But it was apparent, that Victory being obtained, he had no farther Schemes of Opposition to pursue; that it was not in his Design to crush and ruine the Persons he struggled with, or to erect any Dominion o∣ver them as <HI>Britains;</HI> that he had no State Tyranny to erect, no secret Designs to betray the Constitution, and this Negative introduced a War between him and those, who, to out∣ward Appearance, were in the same Interest with him, which at last broke out into a Flame, which produced un∣looked for Events, which will be part of the Subject of the rest of this History.</Q></P>
<P>It need not be added here, for Explanation of things, that the Ministry of the late Queen's Majesty, upon every Occasion, as they found needful, had Re∣course to that old Maxim of Politicks, That <HI>Men might be made use of when they can serve us, without any real Design to serve</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<HI>them.</HI> In a Nation guided by Parties, as this has too long, too often, and too much been, this Maxim becomes more than ordinarily necessary; but in the Case of the <HI>Staff,</HI> this was more parti∣cularly so here also, than at any Time in the Years since the Revolution.</P>
<P>A little Retrospection upon the Hi∣story of the Times, would give us fre∣quent Examples of this Maxim, and of its being, with great Justice and Since∣rity, put in Execution; as in the late intestine Broils of this Nation, when King <HI>Charles</HI> I. arm'd and employ'd the Papists against his Protestant, but male∣content, or rebellious Subjects, yet had himself no Inclination to <HI>Popery;</HI> nor was it any thing more or less than this, that the King, being press'd by the vi∣ctorious Arms of the Parliament Forces, accepted of the Assistance of his Popish Subjects: There is no Question but the Papists had Designs in their View, for the Interest and Advancement of their Party, and perhaps of their Religion too, in all they did; but as a Man drowning, accepts of the Help of the worst Enemy he has, to pull him out of the Water, it is not to be expected he should ask him what Religion he
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
is of, or whether he has not some ill Design upon him in saving his Life. King <HI>Charles</HI> II. in Pursuit of the same natural Principle, gladly accepted of the Assistance of a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Army, and submitted to take the Solemn and National League and Covenant in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> in order to reinstate him in his Dominions; and afterwards made use of a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> General and Army for his Restoration; yet was there very little Cause to suspect that Monarch of inclining to turn <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> or of fa∣vouring the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Interest in his Heart.</P>
<P>I might descend to the particular Time I am writing about, when, upon a former Difference between the old and modern <HI>Whigs,</HI> the former, <HI>if Fame lies not,</HI> scrupled not to accept the Coalition of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest, in order to overthrow the latter, and push them out of the Administration; a Truth so well known to his Grace the D. of <HI>M—h,</HI> and so recent in his Memory, as that he neither can be ig∣norant of the Fact, or forget the Cir∣cumstances which went so nigh, and bid so fair to have supplanted him in the Favour of his Royal Mistress, and to
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
have dismiss'd him from the Service of his Country by his Friends, at least a Year before it was effected by his Enemies.</P>
<P>I have many Tracts written about the Years 1708-9-10, to prove this; and a long Recapitulation thereof is found in an anonymous Pamphlet of that Time, which, on that very Ac∣count, made much Noise, entituled, <HI>The October Club,</HI> written, as was said, by the late Sir <HI>G. H</HI>—</P>
<P>If the Author of <HI>The Memoirs of Scot∣land</HI> says true, the Example reaches thither; for in the History of the late Invasion there, speaking of the Peoples Aversion to the Union, he has these Words: <HI>Nay, the</HI> Presbyterians <HI>and</HI> Ca∣meronians <HI>were willing to pass over the Objection of his</HI> (the Pretender) <HI>being a Papist, pag.</HI> 343. and yet this Author does not suppose thereby, that the <HI>Pres∣byterians</HI> and <HI>Cameronians</HI> were really Friends to the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest; but that such was their Aversion and Abo∣mination of the Union, that they would join with their Enemies so far as might assist them to overthrow the main Evil, and preserve themselves from the capi∣tal Grievance of the Union.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
These Examples would be sufficient to prove the Injustice of that Calumny raised on the <HI>White Staff, viz.</HI> that he was in the Interest of the Pretender, because he made use of the Assistance of <HI>Jacobite</HI> Instruments, in the necessary Opposition which he was oblig'd to make to the Party who set up against him; but the Complaints of the <HI>Jaco∣bites</HI> themselves, and the Length they went afterwards, when they found themselves disappointed, are stronger Evidences upon the Point I am upon, than any thing else that can be offered amount even to a Demonstration, that the Designs of the <HI>Staff</HI> were all along so remote from a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest, that nothing less than the effectual Ruine of their whole Party, would have been the Consequence of the Measures the last was engaged in.</P>
<P>It must be granted, that the <HI>Jacobites</HI> had very just Cause to resent the Con∣duct of the <HI>Staff,</HI> and that they were dup'd and bubbled in the Beginning of these Measures, in the grossest and most obvious Manner; but as they had much more Reason to blame their own Credulity, than any other Cause; so neither can they charge the <HI>Staff</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
with any Breach of Articles with, or promises to them, he having never en∣tered into the least Engagement with them; but they being led by the Sci∣tuation of their own Affairs, to em∣brace every Cloud, and follow the <HI>Igni fatui</HI> of their Imaginations, they fell in with the first Notion of a Court Revolution upon this Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> that every publick Division was to their Advantage; that their Circumstances might be better, but could not be worse; that whatever tended to it was their Business to serve Voluntier with any, and with every Party that would entertain them.</P>
<P>Upon this Foot, they came in and join'd with the <HI>Staff,</HI> as they had be∣fore come in with the <HI>Whigs</HI> against the antient <HI>Staff,</HI> who went before him.</P>
<P>So that the <HI>Jacobites</HI> coming in with the <HI>Staff,</HI> was the Consequence of the Nature of their Circumstances at that Time, as the <HI>Staff</HI> receiving them, and making use of them, was the Conse∣quence of his; that there was never any Concert between them, either of Affection to their Interest or Party as <HI>Jacobites,</HI> appears to me very evident, by the Testimony and Conduct of the
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<HI>Jacobites</HI> themselves, which belongs to this part of our History to relate.</P>
<P>If this Discourse should a little discri∣minate the Persons who really were, as well as those who <HI>were not,</HI> in the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest among the late Admi∣nistrators; as it must be placed to the Account of their own Conduct, it is hoped they will pardon the Historian, whose Business is Truth, and who de∣signs no other Satyrs on the Gentlemen, than the relating of their own Con∣duct makes natural to the Story.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Jacobites</HI> found their Way into the publick Administration, <HI>for no one denies but that some might do so,</HI> they had no more Patience or Power to conceal their Intentions and Resolutions to im∣prove that Advantage for the Service of the Pretender, than they had to conceal their Joy at that Advantage.</P>
<P>Now although this abundantly ex∣posed their Weakness, and want of Po∣licy in the Management of their Par∣ty; yet it also convinc'd the Ministry, that they had some Necessity to keep up the Vanity, and to give them (the <HI>Jacobites)</HI> all the seeming Encourage∣ment to hope for the End they aimed
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
at, that could come from it, with doing nothing else really for them,</P>
<P>That which was most wonderful in all this Part was, that the whole Body of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI> were capable of being impos'd upon to such a De∣gree; and that it was possible the <HI>STAFF</HI> could use them as Tools to such a Length, and not take one real Step in their Favour, as it is certain he never did; and yet they should be so stupid, as that to the last four Months, or thereabouts, to believe him in their Interest.</P>
<P><HI>It was the constant Expression of a late Noble Lord among the</HI> Jacobites, <HI>who had more Penetration of this kind than his said whole Party, and who frequently express'd his Resentment with more Warmth than ordinary;</HI> God d—n him! <HI>said his Lordship,</HI> what has he ever done for us? Has he not fed us with good Words and fine Notions all along; told us, it was not a Time to enter upon the Question; and that to mention any thing of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> would alarm the Nation, and break all the publick Mea∣sures? Has he done any thing but made Fools of us? I am satisfied he is a Spy upon us for the House of <HI>Hanover;</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
he is no more for the Pretender, than he is for the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> by G—d.</P>
<P>But the Party would not believe it, and the <HI>Staff</HI> had such an Ascendant over them, whether by Money or other Management, that they did all his Work, came into all his Measures, and became the most obsequious Wretches in ruining their own Cause, that any Minister of State could possibly desire; never Men were brought in to act so directly contrary to the Interest they profess'd to own; never Men were so handsomely trepann'd by their own Stupidity, or so nicely made Tools to cut the Throat of their own Mea∣sures, as the <HI>Jacobites</HI> were, by the Po∣licy and Management of the <HI>Staff;</HI> and yet had the Folly or Misfortune to believe to the last, or within a little of it, that their <HI>PAM</HI> was <HI>Trump,</HI> and that the Game of the Pretender wos going on.</P>
<P>This Stupidity of the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> gave them up entirely into the Captivity of the <HI>STAFF;</HI> and there was nothing so foolish, so ridiculous, or so essential to the Destruction of the Pretender's Interest, which they were not ca∣pable
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
of coming into, with a real Opi∣nion or Possession, <HI>it can be called no less,</HI> that they were all the while taking the best Measures in the World to bring him to the Throne; they might as well have said, to the <HI>Gallows.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that this Confidence of theirs gave an invincible Argument to those People, who alarm'd the whole Nation with the Apprehensions of the Pretender's coming; and, had the <HI>Ja∣cobites</HI> been allow'd to exercise common Service, the Argument for the Danger of the Pretender had been unanswer∣able; but this requires to be spoke to by it self.</P>
<P>I return to the Conduct of the <HI>Ja∣cobites,</HI> and have eminently prov'd, they have been dup'd in all this Affair, in which either the <HI>WHITE STAFF</HI> shew'd the most exquisite piece of Ma∣nagement, that has been acted by any Minister of State in this or the last Age, or the whole <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party must be allowed to be the easiest People, and the most easy to be bubbled, that ever pretended to be call'd a Party: The Story is as follows.</P>
<P>There was in that Part of <HI>Britain,</HI> which is famous for having the fewest
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Fools, and the most—a Sett of leading Men, whose Interest among their Tenants and Dependants was far from being contemptible, and who, being avowedly and professedly in the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest, were therefore count∣ed dangerous Persons, very many ways, to the Repose of the Nation; they were look'd upon as a People, who, upon Occasion, were able to make the Government very uneasy, and who, there was Reason to believe, wanted nothing but the Occasion.</P>
<P>The first Measures taken with these Men were, if possible, to get them sent up by their Country to the Parliament; Nothing pleas'd them in the World like it; the <HI>Whigs</HI> resented it in the highest Degree; the <HI>Staff</HI> was reproach∣ed with fixing a List, not only pitch∣ing upon some of the meanest of the Nobility to represent the rest; but di∣stinguishing the profess'd Enemies of the Protestant Succession to serve in Parliament, where the farther Security of that Succession was to be one of the great Works they were to do.</P>
<P>Under this Reproach however, the Persons were nam'd, and sent up, and the <HI>Jacobites</HI> in that part of the Nation,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
discovered not only their Wickedness in desiring, but their egregious Folly in expecting, that sending up so piti∣ful a Fragment of the Heads of their Faction, should set their Cause on Foot, even in the Parliament it self; no En∣thusiastick Calculator of Times was ever then so big with his Lines and Numbers, and his having set the Day for the general Conflagration, as these blinded Creatures appeared with the Opinion, that the Pretender was to be introduced by the Voice of the Legi∣slature; and that Her Majesty also to demit in his Favour; and all this, be∣cause their List was in the Number; and that 3 or 4 at most of those, who they called <HI>Patriots,</HI> were to sit in the House.</P>
<P>When it was told the <HI>STAFF</HI> what Offence this gave on one Side, and what gasconading the <HI>Jacobites</HI> made on the other, all he was heard to say upon that Head was, <HI>Let them come up.</HI></P>
<P>They must be very weak sighted, who could not gather by that Answer, what the true Design of the <HI>Staff</HI> was in obtaining that List; and it was but a few Days after they came up, but
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
they saw it themselves; and one of them, now Defunct, openly swore, they were bubbl'd; and that if he had seen the Design, he would never have come out of his own Country.</P>
<P>I remember very well, in a Confe∣rence between two Persons of the first Rank, this Matter was mentioned, and one of the noble Persons expres∣sing himself with some Warmth at the imposing, <HI>as he was pleas'd to call it,</HI> on the Nation so much, as to bring up such Persons to Parliament; the o∣ther coolly ask'd this Question, Are they Men dangerous for the Interest they have in their Country? yes, my Lord, says the other, very dange∣rous, and the Pretender values himself very much upon their Interest there; then replies the second, Pray, my Lord, can they do least Harm here or there? His Lordship paused a while, Are you sincere in that, my Lord, says the first Person? In Faith I did not see into it; I protest it is the best Step my Lord T—ever took of the kind; I will never say a Word more against it.</P>
<P>It was but a very few Days 'ere, as I said above, the Persons themselves
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
saw this too on the Occasion following. The P—t assembl'd, and the first thing done, as is frequent in like Cases, was an Address from the Peers to thank Her Majesty for Her gracious Assurance of Her Royal Favour, and Her Concern for the publick Good, express'd in Her Speech to both Houses from the Throne; making a most du∣tiful Return of their Zeal and Af∣fection for Her Majesty's Person and Government; and a Tender of their utmost Services for Defence of Her Majesty's just Title to the Crown, and standing by Her, and adhering steadily to Her Interest against all Pretenders whatsoever, and against Her Enemies both at home and abroad.</P>
<P>If these <HI>Jacobite</HI> P—s, who had the Folly to dream of other Business to be done that Session, were uneasy at the first Motion of this Address, they were thunder-struck and confounded when they saw themselves singled out and named of the Committee to draw up the Address; then it was that they curst their own Stupidity, and parti∣cularly the Person mention'd before shew'd his Passion in a Manner not easily to be express'd, when meeting
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
my Lord—who was a Partner in his Disappointment, that very Day that the Address was drawn up, he gave some Vent to his Distur∣bance in very warm Expressions; he told him, That it was an Affront to their Nation, that they should be chosen out to do a Work against their Allegeance; that now he plainly saw they had been abused; that he would never have stirred out of his Country, if he had thought this had been the Business of their being sent up to Par∣liament; that they were bubbl'd and dup'd in the highest Degree, and that it was not to be born; then he flew out against the <HI>White Staff,</HI> as the Per∣son that had drawn him into this Snare; and that he had been flatter'd with the fine Story of serving his Country and Family; by which he understood the promoting the Interest of the Royal Family, and of K—<HI>J</HI>—VIII. so he call'd him, the Pretender: And now he not only found that he was deluded in the main Expectation; but that the <HI>Staff</HI> him∣self had singled him out, to put his Hand to the making that cursed Ad∣dress, which had ruined him with his
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
Friends, and ruined his Interest with the Pretender for ever; that he was trick'd every Way in it; for that if he had stay'd at Home, he would have gone to the Hills, and had a fair Day for it; but here was nothing to be done; to refuse, would be to go to the Tower; and to comply, was to betray his King, &amp;c. He told him, he had spoken to the <HI>Staff</HI> of it that Morn∣ing in Terms so plain, as that he might easily understand him; but that the <HI>Staff</HI> laugh'd in his Face, and pretend∣ed to value himself in having done them that piece of Honour, in mak∣ing them appear considerable in the House, and letting their Country hear their Names in an Account so particu∣larly agreeable to the Queen; but he did not notice to them, how it would make them hated among their Friends, and make the Pretender believe they had betray'd him.</P>
<P>My Lord, <HI>reply'd the other,</HI> you are moved indeed at this Treachery, and so am I also; but you don't see all the Wheels of this Machin; we are all trick'd and bubbl'd from the Be∣ginning; the Policy of this damn'd <HI>Staff</HI> has ruin'd us all; and we are
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
wheedled in to be the Instrument of our own Disappointment, by a Ma∣nagement which none of us had Pe∣netration enough to take notice. <Q>“”You know, my Lord, that you had en∣gaged to the—to be ready whenever His M—y should give us Notice; and that he depended upon our Interest, and those of my Lord—, and my Lord—, and the Earl of—, and the Duke of—, and we were able to make such a Stand for him, as should have turn'd the Scale of things, and, at least, brought the Seat of the War to the Doors of our Enemies; but being flattered into a Notion, that the Work was to be done another Way; and made be∣lieve, that the Queen Her self was willing to resign the Crown to <HI>the Pretender;</HI> and that our on∣ly Way was to fall in with the <HI>Staff,</HI> and make our Interest at Court: By this foolish Notion, which you know our Countryman, my Lord—put into our Heads, we were prepared to be made Fools of, and to be taken with the Court Bait; for the Scheme of
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
the <HI>Staff</HI> was only this, to have us perswaded with fine Words to come up to Parliament, and to take it for an Honour to be chosen out of all the great Men of our Country, and the like; whereas the Drift of the <HI>Staff</HI> was only to get us up here sepa∣rated from our Friends and Interest, where the Power is quite out of our Hands, and where we are not able to stir Hand or Foot in the Service we are engaged in.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Nor is this all; but here we are brought into things, not contrary to our Principles only, but such as will ruine our Reputation at Home, and with the K—abroad, and make us uncapable of doing him Service.</Q></P>
<P>Their Complaints grew afterwards more publick, by which they not only discover'd their Resentment, but let into the Secret of that Management which drew them up to Parliament; and let us see, that while many People were expressing their Resentment at the <HI>Staff,</HI> for bringing such People to sit in the House; the <HI>Staff,</HI> if he really obtained them to be chosen; for Hi∣story is silent is that Part also, he did the greatest Service to the Publick that
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
was possible, and quite broke the Measures of the Pretender in <HI>Scotland;</HI> rendring his most considerable Depen∣dents useless to his Interest, and suspect∣ed to one another.</P>
<P>If this was the Case of these Men, it is certain no Step could be taken by them more to the Disadvantage of their Party, than to suffer themselves to be sent up to Parliament; for whatever they might be at Home, themselves were convinc'd that they were insigni∣ficant here, and not capable to do the least Service to their Master the Pre∣tender.</P>
<P>True it is, <HI>as above,</HI> that the <HI>Jaco∣bites</HI> coming so readily into the Service of the <HI>STAFF,</HI> was an Incident which had some evil Consequences, and par∣ticularly, that it gave Encouragement to their artificial Calumny, which some industriously strove to make popular, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Staff</HI> was for the Pre∣tender; nay, that the Queen Her self was for the <HI>Pretender;</HI> things equally absurd, and the one as probable as the other: The <HI>Jacobites</HI> not being able to contain their Joy, were not only weak enough to believe it, but, in their first Transports, deliver'd themselves in
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
boasting Terms to one another, that their King, as they styl'd the Pre∣tender, would certainly be restor'd, even by the Ministry themselves; and so assured they thought themselves to be of this, that, as I have been told, they wrote to that Purpose into <HI>France;</HI> and where they met with the greatest, though not the first, Mortification in that Affair, having their Opinion que∣stion'd by the King himself; for when the Marquiss <HI>de</HI>—reading a Letter to the <HI>French</HI> King, which the Pretender had receiv'd from—to the same Purpose as above, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Staff</HI> was in their Interest; His most Christian Majesty smiling, answered, <HI>They were young Men, and did not know the STAFF.</HI></P>
<P>I shall confess, that the <HI>Jacobites</HI> thus foolishly and imprudently boasting of the Pretender's Interest in the <HI>Staff</HI> and the Queen, was the best Argument that those Men had to use, who politically rais'd that foolish Calumny among the People, and who would have it gene∣rally believ'd, that the <HI>Staff</HI> was in the Interest of the Pretender; but Reason required, that when they found the same <HI>Jacobites</HI> dividing from the <HI>STAFF,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
and joining in with those who sup∣planted him, they should have inferr'd, that the <HI>Staff</HI> had convinc'd the <HI>Jaco∣bites,</HI> that they were mistaken.</P>
<P>But Reproaches are seldom taken off <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the same Hands which lay them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n; the <HI>Jacobites</HI> are the only Testi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ony in this Case, who, finding the <HI>Staff</HI> not for their Turn, tack about <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om him, and, with more Subtilty than they had been Masters of before, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose a new Sett of Men to form an nterest with, and resolved to try whe∣ther they could make themselves a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ends upon the <HI>Staff,</HI> by setting up a new Party against him, whether upon the Foot of their own Measures, or of any other.</P>
<P>It was not difficult to find out Men, among the many, who might think their Merits greater than their Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard, to whom such a Confidence night be committed, and who, either or private Interest, or worse Designs, night be willing to see things take a new Turn.</P>
<P>The <HI>STAFF,</HI> who justly obtain'd the Character formerly given a great Man, that he was <HI>frugal of the Queen's Money, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d prodigal of his own,</HI> had fallen into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Misfortune, which it is impossible <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Man, who shall be intrusted with
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
the keeping the Nation's Treasure, ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ever avoid, <HI>viz.</HI> not to answer the crat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing of all those that would, or thing they ought to have, Share of it; th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Consequence of which is, that all thos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who could not obtain Money or Places or not all the Money or Places, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they thought fit to demand, becam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shagreen and malecontent with the <HI>Staff;</HI> nay, some thought fit to she<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves so to the <HI>Staff,</HI> and to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Queen also; in which their want of Duty was added to their Injustice to the <HI>Staff</HI></P>
<P>That the Court was full of such Men as these, cannot be wonder'd, when the avaritious Temper of some of those who appeared for Men of Interest in the Government, shall be considered.</P>
<P>Among these, we find the first Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Discontents began, and, as was hinted in our first Part of this History, they made loud Complaints, that the <HI>Staff</HI> was not vigorous enough in pursuing the Victory he had obtained over the <HI>Whigs;</HI> it seems these Men, like the <HI>French Batalions</HI> at <HI>Barcelona,</HI> having taken the Town by Storm, claim'd their Right of the Pillage; they al∣ledg'd the constant Customs of War, as well a Party War as other, that, when the Victory was gain'd, they should fall upon the Plunder; and it was an

There were always some wiser than the rest in every Sett of Men in the World, and yet we find some of these overrul'd against their Judgments, by the Majority of their Associates; there were several Men of Honour among those warm People, who press'd them not to carry their Disputes up to a Breach with the <HI>White-Staff;</HI> and were it not that I should seem to flat∣ter, I should name the Man; but Ju∣stice must take Place, what Censures soever follow. It must be own'd for Truth, that the Person who now suf∣fers most deeply in the general Ca∣lumny of the Transactions which fol∣lowed; not only has the least Share in the Conduct, and none at all in the guilty Part; but, with great Importu∣nity, perswaded against the breaking with the <HI>STAFF,</HI> on the Occasions above: He told them, that though the <HI>STAFF</HI> might not do every thing they desired; yet that, perhaps, he saw far∣ther into things than they saw; that he might be slow in the Execution of what they desired to be done; but that they might, perhaps, with more Pa∣tience, either obtain what they desir'd, or be convinc'd by such Reasons as the <HI>Staff</HI> would give them, that it was not convenient; that to break entire∣ly
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
with him, was to leave them all ex∣posed to the Resentment of the Party, who stood ready to discover both; that perhaps the <HI>STAFF</HI> would, in Time, appear more complying; and, in the mean time, that they had better comply with him, than break with him.</P>
<P>But the secret Part of this History is, that there is a Woman in the Bottom of all this Matter; and as a Robbery in which the weaker Sex is concern'd is said to be most bloody, so a Plot, in a female Management, will be impetu∣ous. His Lordship found them all un∣tractable to his wholesome Advice, and not to be mov'd by Intreaties or Per∣swasions, and only err'd in being car∣ry'd down the Stream by the Purse and the Mitre.</P>
<P>This Recapitulation is made neces∣sary by what went before, and brings me back to the Conduct of the <HI>Jaco∣bites</HI> till this Time: Those easy People had supinely join'd in with the <HI>Staff,</HI> obsequious to his Measures, and blindly submitting to all his Dictates, waiting the good Hour when they should see what none but such a Sett of Men as they, could have had Folly enough to think tolerable, <HI>viz.</HI> that when the Queen should dethrone Herself, the <HI>Staff</HI> resign to the Duke of <HI>P—th,</HI> the Mi∣nistry
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
turn <HI>Popish,</HI> and Her Majesty give up the Church, which Her Zeal to main∣tain had cost Her so many uneasy Thoughts, and carry'd Her through so many Difficulties and Hazards.</P>
<P>These things were so preposterous, that it must remain a Wonder to all thinking Men, that these People could continue at all under any such Delusion; but any one might have assur'd himself they could not last long. The <HI>Jacobites,</HI> as is observ'd, began to be impatient, and to suspect, that they were dup'd by the <HI>Staff,</HI> and look about for other Hands to engage with; the Reasons were in∣deed cogent, which gave 'em Suspicions.</P>
<P>They saw the <HI>Staff</HI> had brought the War to a Conclusion; and although the <HI>Whigs</HI> thought fit to exclaim against the Peace; yet they, (the <HI>Jacobites)</HI> when they came to examine the Particulars, found their Cause was wholly abandon'd. They found the <HI>French</HI> King had obtain∣ed his Ends at the Expence of the Pre∣tender; and that, to set up King <HI>Philip,</HI> he had pull'd down the Pretender; they found effectually, by the Part which the <HI>French</HI> King acted abroad, that he had entirely laid aside any Thoughts for their Master; and that he bound himself in such a Manner, as no Christian King e∣ver broke, never to concern himself in
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
their Master's Cause; they found that they had no Hopes in the <HI>French</HI> King's Honour to them, but what must be founded on the greatest Perfidy and Dishonour in the World; and that, to keep a verbal Promise to them, he must, in the most infamous Manner in the World, break all the Asse∣verations, Protestations, Renunciations, &amp;c. that it was possible for a Prince to make.</P>
<P>But suppose, for their Encouragement, they could think him perfidious to others, and true to their Master; they next enquir∣ed into the Posture of his Affairs, and his Circumstances in the World; either he had made a good Peace, or a bad Peace; either he needed a Peace, or needed not.</P>
<P>If, as the <HI>Whigs</HI> say, the King of <HI>France</HI> was at the Door of Ruin; that another Campaign had overwhelm'd him and all his Kingdoms; and that he was not able to have held out another Year; then it must be undeniably true, that he stood in great Need of a Peace.</P>
<P>If then he stood in such Need of a Peace, it was not likely that he would break it a∣gain for their Master, whose Interest was desperate, and placing on the Throne so difficult, as that, in his highest Prosperity, he could never bring it to pass: If, on the other Hand, he did not stand in Need of a Peace, why did he give up so much to ob∣tain it?</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31"/>
Yet farther; they consider'd that either the <HI>French</HI> King had obtain'd a good Peace, or submitted to a bad one; if a good one, he could support the Suggestion of his be∣ing willing to break it; if a bad one, why then have the <HI>Whigs</HI> been so warm in complaining against it?</P>
<P>These things first open'd the Eyes of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> in this Nation, and from the re∣peated Accounts they had from abroad, how impossible it was to obtain any As∣sistance from the King of <HI>France;</HI> but that, on the contrary, he had oblig'd himself to acknowledge the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succession, and never to oppose the same: By which A∣ction, whenever he should perform the same, they knew he would put it out of his Power, or the Power of all the <HI>Popish</HI> Na∣tions, or Kings in <HI>Europe,</HI> to set up the Pre∣tender: I say, by these things they were thought to despair, and that with a great deal of Justice, of any Expectation for their Master, or his Cause, from the <HI>White Staff.</HI></P>
<P>The same Arguments which open'd the Eyes of those stupify'd People the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> must, and will, in time, silence the Tongues of those Men, who would still perswade us, that the <HI>Staff</HI> was in the Interest of the Pretender; and till they return to the Use of their Reason in those things, the Con∣clusions they draw from Passions mov'd by Party, are of no Weight at all, or worth a∣ny Observation.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>
The Reason of the last Peace; the Manner of its Transacting; the Circum∣stances moving to it; the Authority do∣ing it; and all the Objections made about it, are Things not now before me, they have been Debated and Determin'd in Parliament. But thus much belongs to this <HI>Secret History,</HI> as it concerns the Interest of the Pretender, <HI>viz.</HI> That so much was done as effectually convinc'd the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> that they were abandon'd by <HI>France,</HI> and made after off by the <HI>Staff;</HI> that the first had given the Pre∣tender up, and the last had made the <HI>Hannover</HI> Succession be recogniz'd by the only Person in the World, that could have done any thing to make it unsecure, and the <HI>Jacobites</HI> were so effectually con∣vinc'd of this, that from that time forward they mortally hated the <HI>Staff,</HI> and never slipt any Occasion of letting him know it; and yet in saying this I cannot blame the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> for they had Reason to do so: Other Ministry's oppress'd them, double tax'd them, and fenc'd the Na∣tion against them, but still they had some∣thing to hope from their faithful and powerful Ally the King of <HI>France,</HI> but this damn'd <HI>Staff,</HI> to make use of their own Expression, gave them the <HI>Coup de</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
<HI>Grace,</HI> gave them a mortal Stab in the tenderest and most sensible Part, tying their powerful Friend, on whom their Master subsisted, on whom their Cause de∣pended, Hand and Foot, from ever be∣ing either willing, or able to help them.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Staff,</HI> even by this Peace, of which such Complaint is made, struck at the Root of <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and destroy'd the very Foundation of their Hopes; all that could retain the Name of <HI>Jacobitism</HI> in the World, was only to be found in the Intreagues of Parties at home, where if there was any real danger of it at all it was owing to the unnatural Warmth with which private Persons perswade one another, upon the account of their Differences about Places at Court, In∣terest in their Prince, Property, Party and Religion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jacobites</HI> being reduced to this Condition, it is no Wonder that when they found any Discontents and Un∣easiness between those who had the Ad∣ministration of Affairs in their Hands, they immediately fell in with one Side to blow up the Coal, and prevent the healing the Wound, which indeed would have been their Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/>
But a Question offers it self to be spoken to here, <HI>viz.</HI> If the <HI>Staff</HI> had been in the Interest of the Pretender, why then upon the Breach at Court, of which mention has been so often made in these Histories, did the <HI>Jacobites</HI> not close with the <HI>Staff,</HI> but universally to a Man, take part with his Supplanters? Some infer from thence, that all in the Project of the New Court Faction, were in the Secret, and had taken Measures for the Interest of the Pretender, which I do not allow, neither was my Lord—, who has had his Share in the Opinion of that Kind, given any just occasion for that Censure, other than what is already mention'd, of entertaining and employ∣ing <HI>Jacobite</HI> Instruments, but having not the same Genius to manage the <HI>Jaco∣bites</HI> as the <HI>Staff</HI> had shewn in the Pas∣sages above, and which is more, not the same Opportunity; he has left him∣self the more exposed to that Calumny than the <HI>Staff</HI> did.</P>
<P>For now the <HI>Jacobites</HI> were alarm'd at their former Usage, and began to speak of making Terms for themselves, if the <HI>Staff</HI> stood in need of their help, when Men were number'd by the Pole, and not by the Weight they bore in the
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
Nation: <HI>Those Men stood</HI> in need of them both ways, and as they could not have them at so cheap a Rate as the <HI>Staff,</HI> it was more reasonable to think they might bid high for them, and perhaps engage with them farther than they were ever likely to be able to perform. So that on these Accounts possibly there might be more Ground for the Nation of the Danger of the Pretender, than there could be under the Administration of the <HI>Staff.</HI> This is farther evinc'd from the Nature of the Alliance between the <HI>Jacobites</HI> and the <HI>New Party,</HI> and from the Character of those who had the Helm of that Affair, or at least who had the chief Hand in forming the <HI>New Party.</HI></P>
<P>The principal occasion of the Peoples misgrounding at this time their Censures, arises from their mistaking the Person of him who was to be their <HI>Prime Mini∣ster,</HI> which (except to a few) is a My∣stery not yet discovered. Should I say, perhaps, that it was not in this or that Person, the Readers on the other side will suppose me entering upon the De∣fence of another Person of Honour, who they think fit to treat rudely enough;
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
but the Saddle must be set on the right Horse.</P>
<P>The <HI>New Staff,</HI> none will suppose, was design'd or desir'd to be the Person reasonably to be imagin'd, that the Chief Minister that was to devolve upon one into whose Hands they never intended the <HI>Staff</HI> it self should come, and who if he had come, and who if he had un∣dertaken it, they were sure would never come into their Measures, or guide the Ad∣ministration their way; the Person men∣tion'd above, whom they strive to throw it upon, tho' he had the misfortune to be drawn from the <HI>Staff,</HI> to whom he was always before most firmly ty'd, yet was Master of more Judgment than to ap∣pear; the Design they pass'd at, and however over-rul'd, yet must have that Justice done him as to observe, that the Pretender was never oblig'd to him for any thing, and therefore the Chief Mini∣stry then devolved on a Woman, a Priest, or a <HI>Purse-bearer.</HI> Time may give us farther Light into the Reasons there were to judge where it would Center, for that a little time with the Schemes they had laid, would have hung together, which indeed would not have been much lon∣ger
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
than they did, tho' the Death of the Queen had not interven'd.</P>
<P>If Characters would give any Light unto Things of this Nature, it might be needful to know the Disposition of these Three, that from thence the Judicious may enquire, whether what has been said, relating to the intercourse between them and the late <HI>Staff;</HI> and also rela∣ting to the Methods which these Three had prescrib'd for the future Govern∣ment of Things is fit to be believ'd or not: The first of these was of the subtle Sex, Cunning, but willing to be thought much more so than she was; she had insinuated her self into Favour, more by the want of Merit in those that went before her, than by any real Significan∣cy in her self: Her first Court was made to her Advantange, by the large Field of Scandal she had to range over, in the Character of her Predecessors, her Royal Mistress, the Patern of every ami∣cable Quality, and the true Patroness of Vertue, naturally abhorring every Crime, could not avoid having some growing Esteem for her, who daily de∣tected the Wickedness of those who long before had abus'd the Goodness of their Benefactor, every Insolence which a
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
proud Woman or two had push'd them upon, and every Act of Ingratitude, which appear'd in their Conduct, as it came to the Ears of the Person against whom it was committed, fail'd not to gain to this She-Artist the same Ground in the Persons Favour which the other had lost; and if the detecting the Con∣duct of the most unkind Woman in the World, pass'd for a Test of Vertue, in a Mind enamour'd with every thing that had a resemblance of the best Things, it was not to be wonder'd at, since the very opposing her self to those who were so much worse than her self, made her appear in a different Orb, and shew her self as much better than she really was, as the other were worse than they should have been.</P>
<P>The first Step she took for her own Advancement, was to fall upon those who had been the Instruments of doing her good, which Vice she was the more to blame for, from the excuse she made for it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Persons she Sup∣planted were guilty of it before her; she preserved her Interest in the favour of her Mistress, by the same Methods by which she obtain'd it, but when she improv'd it to oppose the <HI>Staff,</HI> she
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
wounded both the Queen and her self, and the struggle it produc'd in the Breast of Her Majesty, between her Justice and her Affection, can no otherwise be ex∣press'd than by that Black which now the Nation wears for the Consequences of it.</P>
<P>The Second of these was of the Church, but of that sort who neither bring it Honour, or do it Service, like as Dr. <HI>Sa∣cheverel,</HI> but of much more dangerous a Quality, by how much his Capacities and Interest infinitely exceeded him, un¦sufferably haughty superrogant and enter∣prizing, restless and indefatigable in pur∣suing his Design, and ambitious beyond Measure in their exorbitant Extent, vain of directing the greatest Heads, and his Envoy never remitted the resistance of those who declin'd his Schemes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Staff</HI> had frequently admitted him to the Concerts of publick Matters, but seeing the precipitancy of his Temper, kept him at <HI>Bay</HI> as to Secrets, and acted with reserve to him in the <HI>Arcana.</HI> Impatient of this Treatment, he strove all the ways possible to remove the Dif∣fidence, and obtain to be Tutor to the Prime Minister, which the Staff, not used to Leading-Strings, could not be
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
brought to: He left no Politick Me∣thod unessayed to bring this to pass; but still the <HI>Staff</HI> was too old for him.</P>
<P>His Temper being less able to bear an Affront than to give one, and his Warmth carrying him sometimes out of his own Government, he laid his own Character too open in his Heat, and by the Me∣thods he took to bring himself in, help'd to convince the <HI>Staff</HI> of the necessity of keeping him out, while he appear'd an Ecclesiastick, and like a true Christian Bishop, confin'd himself to that just Concern for the Church, which every Man in his Station ought to have: His Excursions pass'd for Religion, and his private and most pernicious Crimes were cover'd by that which some call Zeal, but when the States-Man appear'd be∣neath the Cape, they must have been very much Torch-lighted who could not have discern'd the very Sense of all sorts of Tyranny in every Step of his Con∣duct; and that it was even more natural to his Temper than to his Profession.</P>
<P>His abhorrence of a mild Government, and aversion to the Liberty of the Sub∣jects, gave just Reason to believe he would be for the Pretender, were it but from a meer Inclination to be Arbitrary;
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
and some have thought that the Con∣tempt which he shew'd for the <HI>Protestant Succession,</HI> was more the product <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Hatred to the Constitution than to the House of <HI>Hannover.</HI> I will not say he was in any concerted League with the Court of <HI>Barleduc,</HI> but if I should say I believe he was not in that Interest, it must be spoken with more Charity than Sincerity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Staff,</HI> who was always a pro∣fess'd Enemy to rash Councils, had ne∣ver made it his Choice to differ with him, knowing that he was not a Man that one would choose for an Enemy, altho' he was a Man one would be sure to overcome; but his very Disposition drove the <HI>Staff</HI> to an absolute necessity of opposing him, or of falling with him.</P>
<P>Such was his Gust for an Arbitrary Government, that he made all moderate Measures appear Criminal, and arraign'd the Ciemency of the Administration, as a Negligence of the <HI>Staff,</HI> and an Omis∣sion of Duty, and with an Impetuosity natural to his Temper, He was one of the first who fell upon the <HI>Staff,</HI> plow∣ing with the Heifer, found a Cabal in the Administration, which opposed all the Measures of the Prime Minister,
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
and acted independent of him, upon whom the general Calumny of their Action lay.</P>
<P>This explains the meaning of what was said in the first Part of this History, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Staff</HI> was really out of his Power long before he was out of his Post, and that Things were carry'd over his Belly, which however he bears the Reproach of, he had no other Concern in than that he submitted to bear them in Duty to Her Majesty, who was inclin'd at first to believe these Men meant honest∣ly, and that so much Folly could not belong to a Man, whose Conduct she had seen Rea∣son to have formerly so good an Opinion of, the Misfortune was, that Her Majesty lived just to see she was mistaken, but not long enough to resent it.</P>
<P>The Chararacter of the Purse is too well known to dwell upon, and scarce to be enter'd upon with Decency, I take no liberty with his Moral or Personal Infirmities in Times past, which may serve to convince, that the present Bu∣siness is not to blasten the Men, but to mention so much of the Truth as is needful to make them known: It is enough to say that the Opinion the other Confederated Persons had of him, and
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
for which they embark'd him, was found∣ed on his Power, not his Capacity, and he he gave more Weight to them by his Office than his Interest. In State Matters he was rather an Agent than an Employer, and was in Reality among them no more than that Thing which <HI>Hudibras</HI> says <HI>wise Men work with.</HI></P>
<P>His Passion for a hot and furious ma∣nagement of Things carry'd him away from his Union with the <HI>Staff,</HI> to whom he had a million of Obligations, and the hopes of being Prime Minister in an Ar∣bitrary Despotick Administration, led him to push at the <HI>Staff,</HI> with the Ha∣zard of Queen, Constitution and Suc∣cession: It is thought that Avarice led this Person faster to an Ambition, and that he did not so much aspire at the Honour as at the Profit of his Party. Hence <HI>Cromwell,</HI> as <HI>Oliver</HI> was justly said to be an Usurper, tho' without a Crown, so he doubted not to obtain the Mini∣stry without the <HI>Staff,</HI> in which how∣ever some People scandalize his Under∣standing, and thinks his Politicks were as weak as his Eye-sight.</P>
<P>This <HI>Juncto</HI> of the New Party are those of whom the former part of this History has said so much, and to whom
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
the <HI>Staff</HI> directed the Speech mention'd at his recess.</P>
<P>It is said by Fame, that Measures were concerted by some of those, not only to the prejudice of the <HI>Protestant Succession,</HI> but even of the Protestant <HI>Possessor,</HI> and that some Progress was made in the Matter, but I will not load them with Things which I think have their Foun∣dation in the common Prejudices, un∣less farther Proof was made of the Par∣ticulars, neither shall this Discourse which I call a History, deviate into the Nature of Remarks upon their Conduct, or examine how far they have Grounds for such a Reproach.</P>
<P>It is true, two sorts of People fell in with these Men; <HI>First</HI> the <HI>Jacobites</HI> to a Man, who having found themselves made a Jest of by the <HI>Staff,</HI> thought this the way both to faciliate the Design they had laid for the Pretender, and at the same time to revenge themselves of the <HI>Staff,</HI> for making Tools of them, as has been said already: And <HI>Secondly,</HI> All those who having been Malecontent at the Administration of the <HI>Staff</HI> upon any other Account, either publick or pri∣vate, who thought that either he had not done them Justice in their particular
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
Concerns, or that by deposing him <HI>Staff,</HI> they might make their way into the up∣per end of the Administration, or act with more Satisfaction in the Posts they then enjoy'd.</P>
<P>The Conjunction of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> had the same Effect upon them, which it had before upon the <HI>Staff, viz.</HI> it open'd the Mouths of the <HI>Whigs</HI> against those New Managers, as being in the Interest of the Pretender; I cannot say that there was not much more Reason for this Scandal at that time than there was in the Case of the <HI>Staff,</HI> because the <HI>Jacobites</HI> had gather'd Strength by the late Division, <HI>as in all divided Nations the Enemies of those Nations always do,</HI> and which was more, having been lately dupp'd and kick'd up and down by the <HI>Staff,</HI> till they became the common ridicule of the Court, they were even wiser and more wary, and pretended to stand up∣on Terms with those Men before they acted with them.</P>
<P>I must do that Justice to the other Party in the Ministry, who adher'd to these Men, <HI>to say,</HI> that whatever parti∣cular Measures they had in View, and which perhaps led them with more hast than speed, to break with the <HI>Staff,</HI> yet
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
that they never went into their several Measures, or entertain'd any Thought in favour of the Pretender, and there∣fore there is no doubt but had they con∣tinued some time longer, they must have parted from the Purse, as the <HI>Staff</HI> had done before them; for the Measures which the <HI>Three</HI> drove at, would no more have consisted with the Captain than it had done with the Colonel; and as the <HI>Three</HI> drove at all, it was impos∣sible they could go long together, un∣less the Captain would have play'd the same desperate Game they were going on with, which it is plain, having not the same desperate Fortunes upon his Hands, he had neither occasion for, or Folly enough to be drawn into. And here it is worthy Remark, That the Friends of the <HI>Staff</HI> need look no far∣ther back for a Reason, why they found themselves delay'd, and their Expecta∣tions not answer'd in Business of any sort, which they attended upon him for, and for the disappointment thereof they frequently entertain'd hard Thoughts of the <HI>Staff</HI> It was ever his peculiar Aver∣sion to keep People in suspense, who had their Requests depending on him, and the Dependance and Attendance,
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
which is the languishing Deserts of those who have Expectation at Court, were always thought by him to be both unj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st to them, and unnecessarily exacted by Ministers of State; but he had secret Restraints upon him from these Men, and from these Methods taken by a secret Party against him, which render'd him uncapable of ren∣dering those Services, and granting those Favours, which were even the just and customary Consequences of his Employ, and which those who preceeded him had always in their Power.</P>
<P>These were some of the Reasons why several important Posts were kept vacant, and why Things proper to be deter∣mined were oftentimes delay'd: Why the Expectations, which many had just Reasons given them to entertain, could not be answer'd: Nay, why promis'd Favours were frequently left unperform'd, contrary to the Inclination, and perhaps to the Intention of the <HI>Staff.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, to go farther, the displacing of many in Office, in whom there had ap∣pear'd neither want of Merit, or breach of Conduct, as to Parties, was owing to the Oppression of the <HI>Staff,</HI> by these Men who seem inclin'd to do several
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
Things which perhaps would not other∣wise have been done, as well to let the <HI>Staff</HI> see they could give a <HI>Check</HI> to him by their Interest, as also to bring the publick Odium of those Things upon him and his Administration, which was really due to their secret Influence.</P>
<P>All these Things served to convince the <HI>Staff,</HI> that while these Men obtain'd leave to encroach upon him in this man∣ner, there was a necessity for Her Ma∣jesty to be convinc'd by some Means or other of the Mischief they aim'd at, and this at last appear'd impracticable, with∣out his consenting to the remove of the <HI>Staff.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed as <HI>John Bull</HI> was always found to be in his Services, when Things of such a nice Nature came before him, no Man can be so weak to believe he could be drawn into the Game, which these People were playing; it is true, he is now in the <HI>Staff</HI>'s stead as to the <HI>Odium</HI> of those Practices, and the Current of the Times bears down all that can be said in his Defence: Our History there∣fore shall only enter this Caveat in his Favour in few Words, and leave it to Time to make the Truth of it appear, <HI>viz.</HI> he neither had Folly enough to en∣gage in so preposterous an Attempt as

that of the Pretender, nor had he Igno∣rance enough to be led by the People, our History is now mentioning, into any thing whatsoever, and if he join'd with them in any Measures at all, it was on this Foot, That he knew them too well, not to believe he could one time or o∣ther turn them from their new Projects, or overturn them in the Prosecution of them.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Staff:</HI> Having said thus much of the People who oppos'd him, it is needful to begin where our first Part left off. I have mention'd the Measures they began to take, even while the <HI>Staff</HI> yet kept his Ground; how they acted with an independency as to the <HI>Staff,</HI> placed and displaced, put in and put out, not only without him, but a∣gainst him, which brought the <HI>Staff</HI> to the necessity of delivering himself from hearing the Hatred and Calumny which that kind of Administration necessarily brings with it, and which, let whosoever be the Agent, is always sure to fall upon the Prime Minister: And this was one weighty Reason which made the remove of the <HI>Staff</HI> absolutely necessary to him.</P>
<P>While the said Remove was thus un∣der his Deliberation, the <HI>Staff</HI> was not wanting to himself, in letting the Queen
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
know what Hands she was falling into; and to lay before Her Majesty a true State of Her Affairs, <HI>viz.</HI> What these Men aim'd at, to what their Manage∣ment naturally tended, and what Extre∣mities they would certainly reduce Things to; how they would exasperate the People by the just Fears and Jealou∣sies of the Succession, which their Conduct would infuse into them; how they would allarm the Neighbouring Powers, who were intrusted in the Protestant Succession; how they would certainly bring Her Majesty to a necessity of sub∣mitting to some mean Step, for the Sa∣tisfaction of Her Subjects, or of falling into these Measures, which this Faction would be fatal to the publick Peace, and dangerous to her Person and Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>These Representations had wrought so far, as that it was very evident the Queen began to be mov'd, and Her Majesty, who was not so uncapable of receiving just Impressions from Truth, clearly re∣presented as Her Enemies imagin'd, had made some Steps towards con∣vincing the World that She was not a∣bandon'd to the Enchantments of the Cabal, but that She had both Eyes to see
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
when She was impos'd upon, and Re∣solution to resent it.</P>
<P>The first Discovery of this Alteration in the Q—was seen by Her Ma∣jesty's disposing the <HI>Staff,</HI> as has been said, to the Astonishment and Surprize of the <HI>Three,</HI> of whom mention is made already: What Confusion this was to them; how they behav'd in it; what Exclamation they made when they came to talk together, after the Blow was given, these have been taken Notice of, and there the first Part of this History ended.</P>
<P>The subsequent Conduct of the <HI>Three</HI> cannot take up much room, seeing it contains but the History of four or five Days, and those being all Days of Con∣fusion and Distraction, from the surpri∣sing Fate of Her late Majesty; which as it fill'd all Her Loyal and Faithful Subjects with Grief and affectionate Complain∣ings, so it necessarily cast this Faction into Terrors and Apprehensions of many Kinds.</P>
<P>They found themselves young in their Intreagues, disconcerted and undeter∣min'd in their Measures; they had not been long enough enter'd to have commu∣nicated their Designs, even to those who
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
were ready to come into them, or to have given Instructions to those to whom they had communicated their Designs: They had not had time so much as to form them selves, or to pitch upon the Instruments by which they were to act; as in other Cases popular Designs have been defea∣ted for want of a Head, so those sunk of themselves for want of a Tail; they had not brought in their Men, or so much as intimated to the Men they had mark'd out their Intentions of bringing them in.</P>
<P>In every Step they had taken, they found that the late <HI>Staff</HI> was before them, which way soever they turn'd they found him in their Way, and prepar'd to supplant and countermine them: That his Interest was too strong for them to struggle with, and his Head too long for them to succeed in any Thing that he oppos'd them in. The Q—had struck the killing Blow to them just be∣fore Death struck that fatal Blow on her Life, and they found themselves de∣priv'd of that Assistance which they de∣pended on from their Interest in Her Majesty's Favour: So that the whole Frame of their Project was dis-jointed,
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
and not a Hand among them was able to set it together again.</P>
<P>In this Exigence they were likewise attended with that constant Companion of evil Designs, <HI>viz.</HI> Jealousy, and Di∣strust of one another, with apprehen∣sions for their respective Safety and Fear, least every one should make his Peace at the expence of the rest.</P>
<P>By this time the Certainty of the Queen's Death stared in their Faces, the Constitution of their Country appear'd a formidable Enemy to all the Schemes which their New Confederates the <HI>Ja∣cobites</HI> had pretended to lay before them: Not a Man of them had the Courage to stir Hand or Foot in favour of any Thing that oppos'd the <HI>Protestant Succession;</HI> and yet they saw plainly the Fate of all their Measures in that Suc∣cession, nay, even in the first proposal of it.</P>
<P>The Posts which one of them were in, depriv'd them of liberty of being passive; and the first active Part they could possibly appear in, would put the Knife to the Throat of their own Schemes, and be a delivering themselves up bound Hand and Foot into the Hands of their mortal Enemies <HI>the Whigs.</HI></P>
<P>In this Distress the first Comfort they
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
had was to see themselves abandon'd by all their Friends <HI>to a Man,</HI> especially of those who were not oblig'd by their Offices to shew themselves in publick. History has made no mention of their Female Assistant, save that <HI>to do her Ju∣stice,</HI> she faithfully discharged the Duty of her Place to the Person of the Q—in her last Extremities, and was a sincere Mourner for Her Majesty's Death, which she had indeed more Reason for than any Woman about the Court could pretend to.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ecclesiastick</HI> is said to have given a Loose to his Passion, which boiling up to Despair, caused him to go off the Stage <HI>raving,</HI> having neither Grace to repent of what was pass'd, or Patience to consider of what was to come.</P>
<P>The <HI>Purse,</HI> ever false to good Measures, and impotent in bad ones, discover'd the tottering Principles which he had always acted upon, and stood wavering between every Opinion, when the only Man among them, who might be call'd a Minister of State, and <HI>as is observ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> had retain'd his <HI>Senses</HI> and Principles, took this occasion to speak, and <HI>as I have been inform'd</HI> by a few Words, dissolv'd all the Confede∣racy.</P>
<P>In our History he will be known by the
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
Name of this Person, who Lord <HI>John Bull</HI> had broke with the <HI>Staff,</HI> and had unhappily adher'd to the <HI>Purse,</HI> and his Accomplices, in several Things, but Cha∣rity bids us believe, <HI>especially by what follow'd,</HI> that he did not enter with them into any of the Measures which aim'd at overturning the Constitution; <HI>briefly,</HI> that he was never in the Interest of the <HI>Pretender;</HI> and this being a History of Matter of Fact only, I am oblig'd to give a faithful Account of every Particular, as it appears in view, and as Information impowers me to write, let it acquit or condemn who it will: <HI>History</HI> is design'd to relate the Actions of Men, and if they have done well, who some People would have nothing well said of, or ill, who others think are always in the Right; the Historian has no more to do then to repre∣sent Things as they are, and let Men judge as they think fit. This Lord <HI>John Bull,</HI> as I have heard it related, finding the People I am speaking of in a general Confusion, and at a full stand in their Councils, as willing to do Evil as' ever, but without Power to act, astonished at their own Circumstances, and especially at what they saw approaching, under∣took to break in upon their Silence, in Words to the Purpose following:</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="56"/>
He told them, <Q>“”That their Affairs were now in a new Situation; that they were no more to Discourse of what they were to do, as <HI>Ministers of State,</HI> and in Concert for the Carrying on former Measures, but that they were to act as <HI>Members of the Nobility of</HI> Great Britain, and as <HI>Privy-Counsellers</HI> to the Nation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”That all Measures were now un∣derstood to be Determined, and at a full Stop; and they were to Act as they might answer it to the Sovereign that should Succeed; that since it was but too certain, <HI>as they might judge by the Report of the Physicians,</HI> that <HI>Her Majesty</HI> was past Hope of Recovery, they were to consider Her as DEAD, and themselves as Acting NEW. After Her Decease, <HI>He told them,</HI> That he wonder'd to see any Hesitations about what was next to be done, the Laws and Constitutions of the People having so expressly laid down what was their Duty to do. <HI>He told them,</HI> He had heard much of the <HI>Ministry</HI> being for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> as it had been the Sub∣ject of Popular Suggestion; but that he was always of Opinion, no greater Slander could be cast upon them: <HI>That,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
as he was well assur'd, no Person there had entertained any Sentiments con∣trary to the Common Good of the Kingdom, so no one can be at a Loss what Measures they were to enter upon, at the present juncture. <HI>He told them,</HI> they all knew that the Succession of the Crown was limited to the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> That the Elector of <HI>Bruns∣wick,</HI> being the eldest Branch of that House, was the Heir apparent; and besides, what their Duty oblig'd them to: He thought the Wisest Step they could take, was to declare themselves Early, as well to make effectual Provi∣sion for the Peaceable Succession of the Right Heir, and letting the Successor have that seasonable Testimony of their Duty, as to convince the People, who had been Prejudic'd at their Conduct that they had done them Wrong. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> told them,</HI> that however he gave his own Opinion, he would Prescribe to none of them, but he might tell them that as he had sincerely Abjured the <HI>Pre∣tender,</HI> he never entertain'd any though in his Favour; taking all the Notion of his Succeeding here to be Ridicu∣lous, and the Schemes of those Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who had spoken favourably of his com∣ing
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
to the Crown, to be meer Amuse∣ments, and no more; that as he never had any Design against the <HI>Protestant Succession,</HI> so whatever Treatment he might meet with from the Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> yet he would discharge his Duty to his Country, and do as an Honest Man ought to do.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Besides <HI>he reminded them</HI> of the Penal∣ties provided by the Acts of Parliament, especially on such of them as were by Office appointed to Administer the Go∣vernment after the Decease of the Queen, and till the Arrival of the Successor: And how it was no less than <HI>High-Treason</HI> for them to refuse or delay to proclaim the <HI>Protestant Successor. He told them,</HI> he did not say this to de∣clare himself only, for he knew his Duty, and what he was always deter∣min'd to do; but the Arguments he us'd were for their Safety and Advantage, not his own. He acknowledg'd, that he believ'd as things stood then, that upon the Arrival of the Successor, the <HI>Whigs</HI> would recover their Interest in the Ad∣ministration, which he was Sorry for, not only on Account of his own parti∣cular Affair, but on the Account of the Publick; but he declared that he would rather bring in the <HI>Whigs</HI> himself, tho'
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
he was sure to be destroy'd by them, than be concern'd with any one in bring∣ing in the <HI>Popish Pretender,</HI> which could have no other Effect, than the Ruin of his Country, and the Involving us all in a Civil War; making <HI>Britain</HI> a Field of Blood,</Q> and the Seat of a Desolating War.</P>
<P>It was easy to perceive that this discourse did not please those to whom he spoke; but the Juncture was so nice, that not one of them that ever I heard of durst declare himself; they saw the Danger that was before them, had no confidence in one a∣nother, and losing all the Courage they had pretended to before, they seem'd to joyn with Lord <HI>John Bull</HI> in all he had said, and shew'd a kind of an Allacrity, tho' awkward, and dissembled, to that which inwardly wounded them to the Soul: However, having formally assented, I hear it was asked by one of them, what it was they had next to do; to which Lord <HI>John Bull</HI> answered directly thus, <Q>“”You see evidently the Case, the Queen is a Dead Woman, it is impossible in the Ordinary course of Nature that she can Recover, as you have heard from the Physicians just now: My opinion is, That we appoint a Council to Meet im∣mediately, and Summon all the Mem∣bers,
<PB N="61" REF="60"/>
whether of one Party or another; and propose to them the sending an Ex∣press to <HI>Hanover,</HI> to give his Electoral Highness an Account of the Queen's Condition, and to desire him to hasten over, in order by his presence to secure a Peaceable easy Accession to the Crown; and as to our selves, we must take our fate in the Next Reign, the present being evidently at the point of Expiration.</Q></P>
<P>This would not be a faithful History, if it was not observ'd here, that the Histo∣rian does not affirm that this Discourse was really spoken Word for Word by Lord <HI>John Bull,</HI> having not the same assurance thereof, as of what has been mention'd to be said in the former part of this History, if respect to Lord <HI>John</HI> has made the Historian freer in relating what for his Lordships sake he Wishes were true, it is hoped this may be a fault more Par∣donable, than omitting it would be if true.</P>
<P>Let it therefore be suppos'd to be spoken, or Words to that purpose, until it shall by a better Authority be contra∣dicted, when if it appears a mistake, the Historian will acknowledge himself to be Misinform'd.</P>
<P>Till when, I go on with my Account as Fame deliver'd it to the Relater <HI>(viz.)</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="61"/>
that Lord <HI>John Bull</HI> having deliver'd him∣self in this manner, the Meeting broke up immediately; and that there was no room to Hesitate, one indeed seem'd to Re∣gret the Necessity, and they say, rose up expressing himself softly, so as very few heard him to the purpose, <HI>Well, if it must be so!</HI> What further he said, or intended to say, I believe was not understood by any but himself: But as I observ'd, there was no room to Hesitate, the several Acts of Parliament in Force, and made on purpose for this Exigence, were so forci∣ble, and had provided for every Cir∣cumstance in such a Manner, that there was no room for any Man, tho' never so much inclin'd to it, to offer the least Interruption at such a juncture; no Man durst open his lips against what <HI>Lord John</HI> had proposed, or so much as shew himself backward in the propos'd appli∣cation to the <HI>Protestant Successor,</HI> which accordingly went on as was Resolv'd.</P>
<P>This confirms the Opinion of those who argu'd from the Solidity of the Constitution, that there could not be so much ground for the publick Appre∣hensions of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> as others al∣ledged; the Laws having so effectually fortify'd the <HI>Protestant Succession,</HI> as that
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
no Man would be hardy enough, at the Demise of the Queen, to venture in Fa∣vour of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> so much as to move one Step. And so it has proved.</P>
<P>As many will be angry at the Justice done here to Lord <HI>John Bull,</HI> and, per∣haps, be the willinger to have it be∣lieved, that he was not in the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest: So, on the other Hand, some may be displeased that I should suggest, that others were inclin'd to the <HI>Preten∣der:</HI> But the Charge is not lay'd here so as to accuse one, or excuse the other so positively, but that if any one of them had, in Season, openly declared them∣selves, our Secret History should not have failed to done them Justice in the same Manner; and altho' I cannot give the like Testimony to them, yet I will not say, That they had really a Design against the Succession; if any one can prove it upon them, I shall leave it to the Sequel to censure or acquit them.</P>
<P>This last Scene ended all the Trans∣actions of the Cabal above-mention'd; and they never acted in a Body after∣wards; and there also our Secret History must make another Stop. The <HI>Purse,</HI> tho' not first in the Proposal it self, yet as he came into it with Lord <HI>John Bull,</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
so he <HI>over-acted</HI> all his Contemporaries, endeavouring by an Officious Haste to anticipate those, who from better Prin∣ciples were far more steady in the <HI>Han∣nover</HI> Interest: And while Lord <HI>John,</HI> who, with an old <HI>English</HI> Plainess, had declared himself from a true Foundation, in a blunt and direct Manner, was yet made the <HI>Butt</HI> for the Populace to shoot Scandal at, and was run upon with the usual Rudeness of the Party; the <HI>Purse</HI> Carrying himself with an Abject, Fawning Compliance, seem'd to be in a fair Way of being receiv'd into Favour.</P>
<P>He went on in this Manner a great Way; nay, some say, he was not in the least backward, when the said Lord <HI>John Bull</HI> was dismiss'd from his Office, but seem'd to satisfy himself with any one's Falling, while he flatter'd himself that he should Stand: But the Hypocrisy which carried him so far, had not the Success of Carrying him farther, as he had the Weakness to expect, and he fell unpity'd of every Side.</P>
<P>In these Consultations it was remarka∣ble, that as these Men left the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> so now the <HI>Jacobites</HI> left them, from whence the Design of <HI>Jacobitism</HI> in ge∣neral may have this brief Observation
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>
made of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That all the Hopes the Partisans of that Cause ever saw Reason to entertain, depended upon the Divisi∣ons, Factions, and Animosities, which they either found or created among the People of this Nation. It is evident, that upon the Accession of his present Majesty to the Crown, the very Name of <HI>Jaco∣bitism</HI> sinks in the Nation; the unani∣mous Agreement of all Parties among the People, and their Satisfaction in the Person and Government of the King, drowns the very Thoughts of a <HI>Pre∣tender;</HI> and that which was, a few Days past, so Formidable, and fill'd us with terrible Apprehensions, is not now spoken of but with Ridicule and Con∣tempt. We are now no more alarum'd at the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Neighbourhood, or the Power of the <HI>French</HI> King to put him upon the Nation; we do not mea∣sure the Distance of <HI>Bar-le-Duc</HI> from the Sea, or calculate how far he is removed from <HI>France;</HI> while we are unanimous in our Affection and Zeal for the Pub∣lick, while we are united and resol∣ved in the Interest of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Successor, who we enjoy, we are out of all Danger; and I infer from thence, that to preserve the present Unanim ity,
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
and prevent future Divisions among our People, is the only Way to pre∣vent our being again in Danger of a <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>All this while the <HI>Staff</HI> had given him to give Thanks to Heaven, that he had drawn off from these Men in so seasonable a Time, and so open a Manner, that Impartial Men might have Room left, and Reason given them to see to whose Account they ought to place the violent Things which had been Transacted in the Ad∣ministration, not only after his Recess, but for a long Time. It is true, the <HI>Staff</HI> could not expect that the Party-Men, who found it convenient for their other Designs, that, whether True or False, the <HI>Staff</HI> should be Censur'd as guilty of all these Things. I say, the <HI>Staff</HI> could not expect that they would be silenced by these Incidents, however pungent; for it has not been the Custom of these Men to cease a Charg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with good Reasons, which was firs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> raised without. But as the Reaso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of unjust Censure is generally found∣ed in a Resolution to injure the Perso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on whom it is passed, whether Righ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Wrong, so neither will those wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
pass those Censures be satisfy'd with the most clear Vindication. It is not therefore for the sake of such Men, that this Secret History is so particular in this Part, but for the sake of those who are willing to be rightly inform'd of Things, and to pass their Judgment according to Evidence, not according to Prejudices, and the Interest of the Par∣ties.</P>
<P>The <HI>Staff,</HI> I say, having acted as is before Noted, and parted from these Men, now saw the Advantage of it, and had great Reason to be thankful that it had been so, and had Lord <HI>Bull</HI> drawn out at the same time, it had done more to clear up his Character to the World, as to these Things, than all was able to do afterwards: But it was his Misfortune not to see in to the People he was engag'd with till afterwards.</P>
<P>Nor can the Enemies of the <HI>Staff,</HI> bring the least Cavil against the Sin∣cerity of the Parting with those People, or charge him with any design in it, as they would very fain do, unless they would make us believe the <HI>Staff</HI> had the <HI>Second Sight,</HI> and knew of the Queen's Death, which I have reason to say, was a perfect Surprize, not only
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
to the whole Court, but even to her Majesty her self; the Queen not hav∣ing been in a better State of Health for some Years, than she had been in for some Weeks, before the surprizing Dis∣temper which carry'd her off, in which the whole Court will bear Witness to the Truth of this History.</P>
<P>Again, it is evident not only the <HI>Staff,</HI> but the Queen her self had begun to take some Measures, as was mention'd in the former part of this History, for the overthrow of the New Faction, and for such a Management of Affairs, as would have made the whole King∣dom perfectly easy, have secured the Interest of the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to their own full Satisfaction, and have entirely remov'd all the Nations feares, either of <HI>France</HI> or of the <HI>Pretender;</HI> and had not Things been carry'd here by Methods, and with Hands that are not at present proper for this History to speak off, I should have entred far∣ther into this part, and have laid down the Schemes of the New Administration which her late Majesty had resolv'd on, and which the <HI>Staff</HI> would have effected in a short time, which when a Con∣venient time shall be found, will sur∣prize
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
the World and alter their thoughts, not of the <HI>Staff</HI> only, but of the Ge∣neral Management of things during all that Administration; and above all, would make those People a little a shamed of themselves, who have given such Characters of her late Majesty, as if she was uncapable of Acting any thing of her self, or of Judging of the Affairs of her Government, but just as she was led by those in whose Hands she had been pleas'd to place the Ad∣ministration.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledg'd, that altho' when her Majasty had entrusted the Administration in such Hands as she thought capable to Manage the same, she was as willing to Confide entirely in their Fidelity and Vigilance, as a Wife Prince ought to be, who had seen no reason to suspect the Ability or In∣tegrety of her Servants; yet they will neither do Justice to her Majesty, or to her Ministry, who do not acknow∣ledge that the last Ministry endeavour'd more than any Ministry that went be∣fore them, to have her Majesty take Cognizance of her own Affairs, and to Act with a free Agency, doing nothing of Moment, without her Majesty's having
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
first been faithfully told the Circum∣stances of the Thing, and been left to Act therein, without Importunities or Unseasonable Pressings, as had been the Case in former times.</P>
<P>Those who would do Justice to her Majesties Memory, cannot do less than acknowledge this, and that the Autho∣rity in Acting, and particular Cogni∣zance of Things before they were acted, was never so entirely given up to the Ministry as has been pretended; of which a further account may in due time be given to the World.</P>
<P>If any are offended at this brief, but Impartial History of Secret Things, they must be at the same liberty to Write against it, that I have taken to Write it; what has been yet done that way, has appeared so Weak, and so Mali∣cious, that I see no reason to say one word in Replication: Nothing has been offered to refute this Secret History, or to oppose the Matters of Fact as related; as to the Gloss put upon them by Party-Men, it is nothing to the History; my Business is to relate, not to dispute; if what is contain'd in this Secret History is not True, no doubt we shall hear of it in Publick;</P>
