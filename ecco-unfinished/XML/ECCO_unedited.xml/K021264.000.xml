<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Character of LOUISA, in this Play, was evi∣dently written with a Design to offer it to Mrs. SIDDONS; but the Policy of the Theatre not permit∣ting it, the Author has only to observe, that he thinks himself extremely fortunate in having been able to meet with so accomplish'd a Substitute.</P>
<P>The very favourable and flattering Reception this Comedy met with throughout, excepting in one sin∣gle Instance, has induced the Author to retain the Passage which was objected to, in the Copy; that the Reader may be convinced, from tracing the Character, what little Ground there is for supposing he could have been guilty of any intentional Offence, by introducing Party Allusions. The whole Part of Sir GREGORY GLOVETOP, as it now stands, was written above four Months ago; and the Court Phrases were adopted only as incidental to the Character. <NOTE PLACE="foot">☞ The lines with inverted commas are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e representation.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Spoken by Mr. LEWES, in the Character of an "OLD WOMAN."</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDWARD TOPHAM, Esq.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>START not, good folks!—I'm only come a wooing—</L>
<L>You know the fair sex ever will be doing—</L>
<L>In <HI>Moliere</HI>'s days the practice was most common</L>
<L>For men to trust their works to some old woman,</L>
<L>Whose matron counsel, and approving choice,</L>
<L>Secur'd their favourite bard the public voice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Will this bright circle then, who round me sit,</L>
<L>Deny my power of giving weight to wit?</L>
<L>Is there a gallant swain who dares repine,</L>
<L>Struck by the lustre of an eye like mine?</L>
<L>Oh! no—thank Heav'n! the baby-rage is past,</L>
<L>And elder ladies captivate at last:</L>
<L>The full-blown dame, who rules o'er ton and taste,</L>
<L>With rouge for roses, and for lilies paste,</L>
<L>Now reigns the <HI>Ovid</HI> of a new-made school,</L>
<L>To teach young gentlemen—to play the fool.</L>
<L>If in the tender passion then <HI>we</HI> shine,</L>
<L>And age can give us <HI>"smacks"</HI> as well as wine,</L>
<L>No wonder that the fashion is becoming,</L>
<L>And Church, Law, Politics, have their old women.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Bard to-night, all anxious for his fate,</L>
<L>Begg'd the indulgence of a tête-à-tête:</L>
<L>First I was coy—but women will give way—</L>
<L>He saw me tender, and produc'd his Play—</L>
<L>Requested I would make his case my own,</L>
<L>And plead a desperate cause before the town.</L>
<L>—Well then,—to speak at once my real mind—</L>
<L>For, on my virtue, I can't be unkind,</L>
<L>Save some old jokes which now and then appear,</L>
<L>And drop in Parliament, as well as here,</L>
<L>I trust this House will take the Treasury side,</L>
<L>Let the debates go on, and not divid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>
But as the Scenic Sisters long have varied,</L>
<L>And as we wish our measures may be carried,</L>
<L>To stop the mouths of critic opposition,</L>
<L>We form a tragi-comic coalition:</L>
<L>Water and wine—a beverage half and half—</L>
<L>Broad Humour just peeps in to make you laugh;</L>
<L>While intermix'd the tender scenes appear,</L>
<L>To draw from Beauty's eye Compassion's tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is our Author's plan—if trite or common,</L>
<L>Condemn me as a doating, false Old Woman!</L>
<L>—But mark, the critic who approves <HI>my</HI> bard,</L>
<L>May claim a <HI>"chaste salute"</HI> as his reward.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>COME, come, my dear Loveless, don't be too rigid; you must pardon the extravagances of a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, if they are not carried too far—but I wou'd not have you let your imagination run away with your reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible, my friend—No imagination can do her justice; I tell you, my Harriet is the charmingest girl, the most enchanting creature upon earth: <Q>“a per∣son endow'd with every grace, and a mind enrich'd with every virtue.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that case, my dear Belcour, don't trifle with your happiness—Marry her immediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry her!—That wou'd be trifling with my happiness indeed—Why, you forget she is the daugh∣ter of our whimsical neighbour here, Sir Gregory
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
Glovetop, knighted by the old court for a forty ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs at∣tendance upon it in the humble quality of gentleman∣usher, and dismiss'd in the late reform, without any fortune but his stiff-topp'd gloves, and remains of a tat∣ter'd wardrobe: think what a charming patrimony I shou'd be heir to—a short sword, and a dress'd coat with a hoop in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, my gay, lively friend, let me entreat you, act like a man of honour. Consider the sensibility of an innocent mind; nor sport with the heart you cannot properly make your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Loveless, now you are too serious. Is there any violent harm in using a little art to give a woman an opportunity of quieting her conscience, and gratifying, without the ceremonies, your inclination as well as her own?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(agitated)</STAGE> Pray excuse me—I am the last man on earth you shou'd consult on such a subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, this gravity does not sit well upon a man whom I have known the foremost in a fro∣lic, and the first adviser of mischief—I expect your assistance in the business.—Say, shall I fairly take her off? or, if you think it better—suppose I pretend to marry her, and so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(more agitated)</STAGE> I beg you will urge me no further on this head—Indeed I am very unfit to give an opinion: your conversation probably may affect me more than you imagine—but let us call another topic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I hope the name of marriage has not frighten'd you, because you have just got rid of the rea∣lity—Every body knows the terms you liv'd upon with Lady Susan; but it was a match of your father's mak∣ing, and, as Heaven has kindly releas'd you from it, why the sooner you forget her the better. So pr'ythee now drop your heroics, and (as you once had a turn for in∣trigue)
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
put me in a way of obtaining my mistress; for have her I must, cost what it will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, my friend, remember—If you shou'd proceed, and sacrifice to a momentary inclination the rectitude of your heart, you will be as miserable as I am, and live to lament crimes you never can recall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Loveless, explain yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know then, before my marriage with Lady Susan, I was attach'd—tenderly attach'd, to the most lovely of her sex, the daughter of a gentleman who had serv'd his country with bravery and honour—but had retir'd on half pay, to a small neat dwelling near my father's park; where, wholly devoted to the education of his darling child, his only wish was to train her up in the paths of virtue—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>You affect me exceedingly—pray go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>The vicinity of our abodes gave me frequent opportunities of tracing the sensibility of Julia's mind, <Q>“and winning the affections of her virgin heart. Notwith∣standing the humbleness of her fortune, I shou'd un∣doubtedly have married her, had I not too well known the ambitious views and rigid temper of my father.—Transported however with her blooming charms, which were daily heighten'd in my eyes by proofs of growing tenderness, incapable of existing without her;”</Q>—and, too conscious of her purity to expect to gain her by other means, I was base enough to listen to the specious arguments of libertine friends, and engaged in a plan to deceive her by a pretended marriage—I see you are shock'd at my villainy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>My family at length obl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging me to unite myself with Lady Susan, I was compell'd to reveal the fatal secret.—O, Belcour! picture to yourself the distress of an unhappy woman, bereft of that honour, the only
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
portion which her father's narrow fortune cou'd bestow, by the very man in whom she had plac'd unbounded confidence—<HI>(bursts into tears)</HI> 'tis impossible to describe the conflict in her bosom. In vain I tried every argu∣ment I cou'd suggest to tranquillize her mind.—She treated my professions of undiminish'd regard with ap∣parent coldness and disdain; and, together with our infant son, left the house where she resided; eluded every re∣search I cou'd make; and at length, I have every reason to believe, fell a victim to my treachery and ingratitude.</P>
</SP>
<Q>“”

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not—Come, come, my friend, your apprehensions may be groundless—She may yet live to soothe and cherish your repentant hours—at least your child may want a parent—Why then think of leaving a country where it is your duty to stay?—that if the unfortunate mother is no more, you may call down forgiveness from her relenting spirit, by encreas'd affection to her blameless son.</P>
</SP></Q>
<Q>“”

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! that consolation is denied me. He too, poor innocent, hath shar'd his mother's sorrows, and her fate. Notwithstanding my strictest enquiry, I have not been able to gain any tidings of either of them; my only success has been in discovering the re∣treat of Julia's disconsolate father.</P>
</SP></Q>
<Q>“”

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>But say, how did he sustain so rude a shock?</P>
</SP></Q>
<Q>“

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! imagining that she was privy to the imposition of the marriage, he turn'd that rage against his daughter which ought only to have fallen on me, and imprecated severest curses upon himself if ever he saw her again.</P>
</SP>
”</Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pity your situation, Loveless: <Q>“but re∣collect, that your conduct, tho' criminal, was the result rather of your father's disposition than your own.”</Q></P>

<P><Q>“No, my friend, I have search'd every ave∣nue
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
to my heart, and find no hope of consolation.”</Q>—I have however written to the injur'd veteran: confess'd the pretences under which his daughter was deceiv'd, and offer'd the only atonement in my power, the entire dispo∣sal of my fortune, as he shall think proper.—I shall wait his answer here; and then bid adieu to a country em∣bitter'd to me by the severest of pangs—the sad remem∣brance of a disgraceful triumph over unsuspecting inno∣cence and tenderest love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce to these melancholy ideas—<Q>“let us, like friends, be useful to each other.”</Q> You shall pro∣fit by my advice, and I by your misfortunes.—<Q>“I will desist from every dishonourable plan against Harriet; and you shall learn, from my philosophy, to conquer griefs which cannot now avail.”</Q> You shall stay with us this summer, and share the rural recreations of this charming seat—Our noble host, my Lord Hectic, will do all in his power to entertain you; and indeed it is im∣possible to restrain the smile at seeing him constantly la∣bouring to become the very character you lament—an anxious wish to be thought a libertine, without constitu∣tion, or even inclination, to be really so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Absurd man! Yet how happy I shou'd think myself, had my desires never carry'd me further!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me however caution you against▪ his sister, Lady Betty Wormwood, who, without half his good qualities, has a much more mischievous disposition. She does all she can to keep her brother single, expecting to inherit great part of his fortune, and therefore charitably abuses every woman she hears of. My good aunt too, Miss Penelope Zodiac, her guest and companion, tho' she is generally in the clouds, now and then condescends to favour us with some earthly ideas, on purpose to join in the invectives against her own sex, with all that benignity
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
of disposition for which old maids are so remarkably▪ famous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>O spare your aunt, at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I—I only follow her example—She spares nobody.—But let us adjourn to the mansion; my Lord has by this time, I dare say, finish'd his morning's ride on his chamber-horse; in which case his Irish cousin, Captain Swagger, <Q>“who has nothing good about him but his appetite,”</Q> will be bawling for his breakfast.—The Captain is very unlike his countrymen; for they are generally brave to an extreme—but he, I believe, is not so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(in a pensive manner)</STAGE> I am sorry for it—An Irishman without courage is very rarely to be met with; so that the novelty of it will surprize me at least—tho' nothing, I fear, can give me entertainment.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fore gad, my valiant Captain, thy ap∣pearance is a little too terrific for the tranquillity of my country-seat—thou must really change that warlike habit of thine, and think of more peaceable services.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>O be easy now, my Lord, and let my habits alone. To be sure I've a custom of looking pretty manly in the face, and that's no common habit now amongst gentlemen; and, thanks to St. Patrick, I have a tolerable good constitution;—but so much the better for your Lordship, for I have been making pretty free with it these ten years past—for the sake of your reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! Swagger, it is not thy consti∣tution I complain of, but thy head—thy crazy head, that cannot carry into execution the glorious enterprizes I plan for thee. What is the cabinet without the key? or any of the Boards without the first Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, boo woo, don't be after comparing me to a board, and praising your own qualifications, when you know they're all mine: you have forgot what use I was to you when we travell'd together; how I constantly remember'd what was to happen, and carried away all the things we left behind us—</P>

<P>Yes, yes, I remember you pocketed the old bills, when I had paid the reck'ning.</P>

<P>How! what!</P>

<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be sure, the old knight here, Sir Gregory Glovetop, could not help thinking my <HI>tête-à-tête</HI> visits to Madam Louisa, especially as you were al∣ways one of the party, would do his daughter Harriet no good—so he has sent madam a-packing, that's all.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and hav'n't you sacrific'd the poor ereature's happiness, by frightening away her friends from her? and can't you be satisfied with the distress you have already occasioned, and the ill reports that are spread about her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—there are no ill reports that I have been successful—so what distress is there to satisfy me? Fly therefore about the neighbourhood, and find where my treasure is hidden.</P>

<P>O now, if that is all your treasure, be quiet and easy; because why, when one treasure is lost, another may be found—that's my philosophy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Miss Penelope Zodiac, geography and tactics are unquestionably the principal supports of a woman's character; though, owing to the unaccountable ignorance of mankind, three parts of our sex get married without any such perfections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get married!—so much the worse. If women's minds were properly filled with elaborate re∣searches, they would have no vacancy for such unseemly ideas. Think of the divine charms of philosophy—pure ethics—to wander from pole to pole, and to swim in the milky way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, Madam, if a lady must swim, the milky way is as well as any other; and, to a roving mind, the wandering from pole to pole may be very delightful; but I should imagine the less a woman wanders the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, thank Heaven, my mind, I am proud to own, has never descended so low as to con∣template that improper creature a man.</P>

<P>For goodness' sake let us then change the discourse, and talk about a woman.—What think you of Louisa, the object of my brother's present pursuit?</P>

<P>What that affected widow that lives at Sir Gregory Glovetop's, and pretends to be fond of nature; though she knows no more of the planetary system, than I do of making a pudding?—Oh, I detest such audacious creatures, as every lady of sentiment ought to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, I believe the wretch has the confidence to think that my brother entertains ho∣nourable designs upon her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not—but, lest the lady should

never take to studies of that kind, I will tell you what I have done: you must know, though I am naturally of a tender disposition, and extremely averse to every thing that's cruel—yet, for the sake of example, I have pre∣vailed upon old Sir Gregory to turn her out of his house. My brother will most probably forget her; and the minx will be happily left to starve in some distant country, so that we sha'n't be shock'd with her distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very kind precaution—but indeed, Lady Betty Wormwood, your brother is a sad libertine—quite an ignis fatuus, as the learned call it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>He certainly is, and therefore he had much better remain single, and keep his fortune in his own family.</P>

<SP>

<P>To be sure, the whole world had better remain single.</P>

<P>He will be delightfully disappointed when he finds the bird is flown. I have a very great regard for my brother, but I do love to see him mor∣tified.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I, Lady Betty—because he will never allow that we women have superior understandings to the men. Oh, what was Plato, for instance, to the queen of Sheba? or what would the duke of Marlbo∣rough have done with the maid of Orleans?</P>

<HEAD>SCENE IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Apartment in an old House belonging to Sir <HI>GREGORY GLOVETOP,</HI> furnished in a very antique manner, decorated with Ornaments of Heraldry, Coats of Arms, Badges, Ban∣ners, and antient Orders.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>SIR GREGORY,</HI> somewhat heated, followed by <HI>HARRIET.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my decorum, Harriet, I am quite ashamed of you.—<Q>“”You have no idea of punctillo, and form, and etiquette, and ceremony; not an atom of the old court about you, as my name is Sir Gregory Glovetop.</Q></P>
</SP>
<Q>“”

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, dear Sir, the difference of our years: saving your presence, it is not to be expected that I should wish to have any thing old about me.</P>
</SP></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Sir Gregory."</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, child, I swear by my knight∣hood, you are as rude and unpolished as a beef-eater.—Will you never entertain a proper respect for antient cus∣toms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, papa, am I to be blamed, because I have the misfortune not to be so old as my grandmother?—Besides, I have been bred up in the country, and can∣not have had an opportunity of seeing or improving from courts.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! not had an opportunity of im∣proving! han't you seen me? Study my manners and ad∣dress;
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
and then learn what would be becoming in a young woman. A fine example, indeed, thrown away, if I, who have lived in the circle, presided at drawing∣rooms, bow'd at levees, eat cake and caudle-royal, should have danc'd, and bow'd, and eat for no purpose!—I beg I may hear no more of this uncourtier-like friend∣ship you profess for Louisa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, sir, our long intimacy, her amiable dis∣position, and her hard fortune, together with the manner in which she was obliged to quit our house, after having been admitted into it as a resident, must leave a regret upon my mind, which I hope you will allow not quite unjustifiable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the reverse, I assure you; and not a precedent for it in the red book. I allow no friendship, but of form: when people are out of place, the ceremony is to forget them—a squeeze by the hand—or a proper nod of the head—but no more;—no sorrow upon the countenance, except at a court-mourning.—That was the rule in my time, and I never can forget the lord chamberlain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear papa, was it not rather unkind to compel my unhappy friend to retire from beneath your roof, because that odious Lord Hectic would plague her with unsought-for solicitations; and to force her and her little infant to seek a new habitation, for impertinencies which hurt her peace more than they cou'd yours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush, child! Lords have great privi∣leges, and, at the old court, carried a dignity which, with a proper dress, a full-bottom'd periwig, and a short sword, were truly respectable.—But, let me tell you, that no person who has had the honour of dining with the corps diplomatique, can or will brook great coats and dirty boots—I mean no offenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the peerage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear papa, can you imagine, that a
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
mind like Louisa's, so worn with anxiety, can thus easily regain its happiness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I always thought she was too pen∣sive for a well-bred person. You should have seen me at a birth-night, bowing, and simpering, and squeezing, and nodding, and handing wine among peers and peeresses, laced down to my shoes; stockings rolled up; and periwig in full float; then, I think, you would have taken me for somebody—every feature curl'd into a smile, and not one look of thought upon my countenance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But surely, grief was natural to the tender∣ness of a disposition like Louisa's—her fortunes were of the humblest kind, and she had probably lost the husband of her fondest affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>The French Duchess of Pantoufle lost five husbands, and always appear'd in her place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, consider the unprotected state of her little one—the sweetest boy! you could not help being pleased with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the boy might have done for a page—I had some thoughts of teaching him the true court-step myself—but that ministry are out, and so we'll think no more about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear sir, picture to yourself her situation—alone, deserted—no friend to sooth—no parent to pro∣tect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, there again;—her father is still liv∣ing; why don't he send an envoy, or plenipo, to the place of her residence?—you say, he was displeased with her marriage; what of that? there is no occasion for affection to preserve ceremony—I remember Count Bal∣derblouski, from Poland, had no intercourse with his child for twenty years; yet they always kept up deco∣rums, solemnized their birth-days at five hundred miles distance—and hated each other with civility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd Louisa had a father's home, as I have, to retreat to, instead of being forc'd to seek an asylum among strangers; who, unacquainted with the gentleness of her disposition, may aggravate the sorrows which they cannot feel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can I help it, child, if every one is not so well versed in politeness as I am?—Besides, I am natu∣rally gentle, and have said to her a thousand times, that no one would be so charitable to her as myself.—Ma'am, says I to her, in the kindest manner, you are left desti∣tute—a kind of outcast—but what of that? behave properly, and I will condescend to give you a certain degree of consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, recal your cruel decree, and in∣dulge your Harriet with the pleasure of bringing back under the same roof the friend and companion of her earliest years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, child! when I have told you I am gentle, dare you prescribe to me how I ought to act! I that was the corner-stone of the old court; brought up amongst maids of honour and bed-chamber ladies, <Q>“admitted to the back-stairs, and have peep'd through the closet key-hole.”</Q> O, I am petrified by your pre∣sumption!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear papa, I hope you are not offended at my presuming to plead the cause of friendship—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, child, I am offended.—Now, indeed, people don't know when they ought to be so;—affect to be pleased, when they are quite out of humour; laugh at every thing; and want a demeanor in their resentments: but, thank Heaven, I am better acquainted with dignity.—The old Lord Burleigh, when he was offended—he—hum!—I believe he walked off, and said nothing.</P>

virtuous and much-injured friend, in whose sweet society I have enjoyed so many happy hours, and from whose gene∣rous counsels my inexperienced youth has reaped so much advantage?—No; every sentiment of gratitude and hu∣manity forbid it. I have already consulted my Belcour on the occasion: his tenderness for me is, I think, sincere; and he must doubtless prize that warmth of friendship in his Harriet's bosom, which may lead him to expect she can as forcibly feel a softer passion. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A retir'd Cottage, with a View of the Country: A Seat at the Foot of a Tree, near the Door of the Cottage.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>LOUISA</HI> coming forward with a Book.</STAGE>
<P>HOW vain is the philosophy which books would preach up to us, to assuage the real anguish of the heart!—The wounded mind, that wanders to them for consolation, returns with double force to home-felt grief; and, while it feels poignantly for feign'd distress, with added pangs will contemplate its own.—Then how can I expect to find relief from study? mark'd out for af∣fliction from life's earliest dawn, its ripening day but brings encrease of woe.—Alas! that charming season of youth, when all around, gay, flattering expectation gilds the scene, and every coming hour seems wing'd with new delight, for me teem'd only with misfortune!—Born with a heart too tender, and perhaps too sanguine, I fond∣ly plann'd delusive schemes of happiness, which Fate de∣creed I never should enjoy. One friend,—one only friend the world had left me; she too I now must lose.—Poor Harriet!—<Q>“tho' tormented by the caprices of a weak father, may'st thou never suffer half the misery of thy distracted friend!”</Q> My child too,—my little smiling boy,—he must be for a time deserted.—Alas! who knows how long?</P>
<STAGE><PB N="19" REF="27"/>
Enter <HI>ANNA</HI> and the child from the cottage.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anna.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear lady, every thing is ready, as you order'd, and your writing-box and the miniature picture are left upon your table.—But, my lov'd mistress—forgive my boldness—can you really bear to leave your sweet companion behind you?—will you indeed trust him with me while you are gone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trust him with you, my Anna! Alas▪ to whom else can I bequeath him?—The unfeeling world hath barr'd each door against him, and poverty's hard hand leads forth his infant steps.—Now, too, he must forego a parent's tenderness;—but I hope our separation will not be long; and you, who feel for him a mother's love, will, I think, guard him with a mother's anxiety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, mayn't I go too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my angel,—my journey would fatigue you—its object is but to do you service—may its wishes be accomplished! and may my darling child's maturing years be happier than his morn of life has promised!—Here, Anna, take this trifle <STAGE>(giving a purse)</STAGE> I wish it were larger for your sake—but Fortune allows me to be profuse of nothing but my thankfulness;—it will serve, perhaps, to defray the necessary expences of my Fred'ric; for the rest, dispose of it as you like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray now, my dear lady, excuse me.—Indeed I cannot accept of it.—You have been always a tender mistress, and I have sav'd a something in your service,—a trifle indeed, but how can I employ it better than in returning it to the dear child of her from whose goodness first it came?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, hold; your generosity oppresses, over∣powers me—but some one is coming this way:—retire, therefore, for a moment—I would not that strangers
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
should know how sensibly I'm affected, by the exalted behaviour of my more than friend.</P>
<STAGE>[They go into the cottage.</STAGE>

<STAGE>Enter <HI>HARRIET</HI> hastily.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dearest Louisa, I would not lose an instant in hastening to you, the moment I cou'd escape from my father. But wherefore these tears?—Your boy—my little play-fellow, I hope, is well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, very well;—I grieve only to be the cause of so much trouble to my Harriet.—Alas! I seem born to give uneasiness to all my friends;—at least the few I have left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, my Louisa, conquer this despon∣dency—indeed you have a great many friends—every good mind must be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How soothing is your sensibility!—why am I flatter'd with kindness, only to make the parting with it more severe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Parting, Louisa! what is it you mean? Do not imagine this misunderstanding can long continue—assure yourself we shall soon again be happy; and this little interval will but increase the charms of our renewed society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible—my resolution is taken:—there is a person whose regard, notwithstanding long neglect, I still hold it my duty to solicit:—once he has refused, cruelly refused to hear me—shou'd his unkindness still continue—but no matter.—At a distance, Harriet, I may perhaps have courage to reveal to you a story, which my blushes wou'd prevent me from doing in your presence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Changing her manner)</STAGE> What then, my fair friend,—there is a some one whose regard you are more anxious to solicit than that of your humble servant.
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
—In truth I ought to have consider'd that immoderate grief in a widow, a young, handsome widow, like you, was not altogether so natural.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Harriet, you mistake me much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>In truth but I do not.—No wonder that the gallant addresses of our neighbour, Colonel Quorum, that military dispenser of warrants, and settler of disputes, should all be lost upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lost upon me indeed!—O my gay, sprightly, yet feeling friend! wou'd I cou'd always be the occasion of calling forth that charming vivacity! The Colonel, I agree with you, has certainly an excellent heart, and not∣withstanding his violence, and his continued swearing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Swearing!—Oh, he is a justice of peace, you know, and is us'd to it;—besides, a lover shou'd always have a good stock of oaths to begin with;—but, laughing apart, Louisa, he has an ample fortune, and is sin∣cerely attached to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you talk to me seriously on such a subject?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if your affections are really engaged, I mention it no more;—but otherwise I shou'd have said, that your duty to the deceased has been more than paid; and, though I cannot imagine that here your heart wou'd be deeply interested, yet you have a child, whose wel∣fare is your care—independence is offer'd to him: he has no father's fortune, give him therefore a claim to inherit one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray drop the subject,—perhaps he has a fa∣ther, and may not ask the bounties of a stranger;—per∣haps—what am I saying?—Pray Harriet, believe me, I was thinking of something else, and did not properly at∣tend to your discourse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(taking her hand)</STAGE> And is there, my Louisa, any thing which you dare not reveal to your friend?
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
Some private grief that you think her unworthy to be trusted with.—Tho' all your Harriet's inmost thoughts have long been lodg'd in her Louisa's bosom.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>PICKAXE</HI> hastily.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I am so glad I have found you: for I've been in every corner of the parish these two days, with a message from my master, Colonel Quorum, and no tidings cou'd be heard of you.—So I went into the ale-house hard by; for there, thinks I—but I beg pardon for being out of breath.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no occasion to beg pardon,—but pray don't be in such a hurry;—you'll suffocate your∣self, Mr. Pickaxe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, madam, I cannot talk so fast as the women, as I say to my wife;—but no matter for that:—so, going into the ale-house, I heard as how a strange lady, which I knew must be you, was come to live here∣abouts, and that Sir Gregory Glovetop,—I beg your papa's pardon, Miss Harriet—had turn'd Madam out of doors, which was being a little upon the rumbusticle with a lady, says I,—but no matter for that;—I never talk of any body's affairs but my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you keep to that resolution we shall never hear any thing of your master's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Madam, never fear him—he'll make him∣self heard when he's in a passion;—and, indeed, to speak by the statutes, as master calls it, he is in a very great passion for Madam Louisa; for the moment he heard how your ladyship was treated, quite no better than a vagrant, he swore he would commit the whole parish, and Sir Gregory Glovetop into the bargain—but Lord, Sir, says I—its all the better for your worship, for the lady, as I may say, being a little at a nonplus, and not knowing
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
where to turn herself, who knows but she may face about to your worship's regimentals?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. Pickaxe, you seem to have form'd a very just opinion of the sex—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Ma'am! as I said to my master when he had done swearing, I know them—Madam Louisa must be in trouble: she is not like Miss Harriet, as I said, gallanting it away of her own accord with the gentleman in the green walk, because she is in love with him her∣self—No, no, Madam Louisa wants pressing, and a bit of vexation—and then she'll come to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, my honest friend, you cannot think I want vexation; however, I am not going to be angry, for if such is your interpretation, Mr. Pickaxe, it will be very dangerous to be vex'd in your company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it's my fault, as I say to myself, to be sincere;—for, as I said to his worship, what can you want with a wife? have not you the disturbances of the whole parish to settle, and to swear (I mean to hear people swear) from morning till night—and then, since you took to train∣ing volunteers, says I, and to firing great guns, and have peace neither at home nor abroad, what the Devil, says I to his worship, can you want with a wife?</P>
</SP>
<Q>“”<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what could his worship answer to that?</P>
</SP></Q>
<Q>“<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, madam, its my fault not to be minded, because I say little; but I verily believe as how, if Ma∣dam Louisa wou'd but listen to his addresses, there is not a justice of peace in the whole hundred that wou'd commit matrimony sooner—</P>
</SP>”</Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Mr. Pickaxe, the Colonel has no occasion to say much for himself, while he has so able an advocate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, madam, a few kind words from you wou'd make a man of him again; for, to say truth, he is
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
sadly out of sorts—can't sign a warrant in peace.—Do, Madam, sent him a little comfort, be it ever so cold;—do but say you love him now—if its only to please him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my good friend, I cannot say that to any man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Ma'am, if you can't love him, say you'll marry him, and let t'other come by and by;—I'm sure Miss Harriet here wou'd not be so difficult.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg, Mr. Pickaxe, you will not be fancying things about me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fancying things!—No, Ma'am, I leave that to the gentleman in the green walk.—I ask pardon for being sincere;—but, as I was saying, if you wou'd only be so good as to give him a kind look or two, just as much as to `say I see you,' he'd go quite out of his wits, and be the happiest man in the world.—Come, Ma'am, I'll tell him you like his carriage—his air, and the calf of his leg.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I request you will tell him no such thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you think him a fine officer, and a good justice of peace.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make no doubt but he is both; but let me intreat you not to mention that I say any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Ma'am; then I'll only say that I said it—and that you said nothing. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you then forsake me? and leave her,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My kind, my tender Harriet, assure yourself, cost me what it will, before we finally separate, you shall be fully acquainted with the sad story of Louisa's woes—then perhaps my soften'd friend will find another and a newer tear to give to my misfortunes—perhaps she'll clasp me nearer to her heart—perhaps she'll hold me at a fearful distance. However it may turn out—believe me, the parting pang will deeply rend my bosom; and absence, time, nor circumstance, shall ever erase the fond remem∣brance of my Harriet's virtues.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> LORD HECTIC, LOVELESS, <HI>and</HI> BELCOUR.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, Belcour, I know you and your friend Loveless must laugh at us country 'squires. You London gentlemen have no taste for rural charms, and the ruddy looks of the country—hem! hem!—for my part, however, give me the old English constitution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope your Lordship feels no necessity for that wish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! hem! by no means—I speak only of the charms of rising early in a morning, taking a long ride, breathing the keen air, hem!—and pursuing those active pleasures that strengthen and invigorate, and make us Englishmen the terrors of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo, my Lord!—to say truth I shou'd not have suspected your having a taste for rural sports, shoot∣ing, fox-hunting, and the et caeteras of a country life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more I have—do you think I want to rival my game-keeper?—Those were the barbarou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arts of our ancestors in the days of boxing, who affected to be stronger, hem! than a gentleman ought to be—No, no, I mean the little innocent delights—the smiling wreath, hem!—and myrtle bower.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Lord, and the smiling beauties in that bower—a London out of town—the charms of Pall∣mall in the groves of Hampshire—that, I presume, is your Lordship's rural life; at least if we may trust the gallant chronicles of your Lordship's seat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>O fie! Belcour—But do they say that I'm no Joseph?—Juvenile follies, though, shou'd be for∣given—Some people do these things out of vanity, that surprizes me; merely to be talk'd of, Mr. Loveless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a miserable vanity it is, as your Lord∣ship observes. Passion, indeed, may plead some excuse for a momentary indulgence of it; but we should ask no triumphs for our infirmities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Mr. Loveless—upon my word—a very—hem! hem! a very just observation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; but then, my Lord, that wou'd be too severe a judgment, were it to extend to every little gallan∣try with a grizette.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>True again, my dear Belcour; some al∣lowance ought to be made, for, hem! the errors of the constitution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>And upon my word his Lordship has some right to plead weakness in that article—therefore I retract my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, I fear you do but flatter me, now—for you know, Belcour, I am a little of a—hem! of a li∣bertine; and, to tell you the truth—but your friend Love∣less there looks so moral and serious, it's impossible to say any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="35" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a town man—a perfect town man—don't mind him—a mere hypocrite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad then I need not mind him—All a sham, ha? not so innocent as one wou'd imagine—never deceived any woman. <STAGE>(smiling.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! no more than you have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, my Lord, we have neither of us had any transaction of that kind to boast of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Boast of!—by no means—but, <HI>entre nous,</HI> I must confess, without vanity, that I do succeed pretty well amongst the ladies—hem! A peer, you know, carries an appearance—a blaze, a hem! hem!—the girls are astonished—dress makes its way—and—a star for a gar∣ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>A garter! O that's the game you pursue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure—woman is the game of a man of spirit—hem! and I have found out such an ob∣ject to chase; and, with your assistance, have no doubt but we shall run it down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can my assistance be necessary? I fear, my Lord, it will not much avail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, boys, you must all assist; and fine sport we shall have of it—for the lady affects to have virtue, and stuff of that kind!—hem!—but in the country we do as you do in town, treat it as a pretence—mere pre∣tence. Besides, I only begin with coaxing, and if that won't do, I proceed to vigorous measures—hem! hem!—that's the way to succeed with the women—en't it, Bel∣cour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship, indeed, wants little instruc∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; 'egad I am pretty well at those things—'tis not a little that stops me. You wou'd go thro' any thing, I dare say, for a fine woman, Mr. Love∣less. I mean it as a compliment—so don't be ashamed—
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
But I won't be cruel to the poor creature. I intend to behave well; and, when my passion is over—hem! and if she has shewn a regard for me, I shall marry her to a good sort of fellow you may have seen in the house—a Captain Swagger.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> CAPTAIN SWAGGER.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, my Lord, and here I am, like the old proverb about bad news; and a sad story I've found out, for Madam Louisa's not to be heard of—so I cou'd dis∣cover nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, you have found out a sad story about nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure—for they say she is going to be married to Colonel Quorum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Married! undone—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, she has undone herself—in order that she mayn't be ruined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>What reason hast thou to think so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>First and foremost, as I was taking a little dram at the public-house, just to cool me—who shou'd come by but Mr. Pickaxe, the Colonel's clerk▪ or rather his aid-de-camp, in such a hurry—and, though I asked him to take a sup, he wou'd not open his lips upon the subject—upon my shoul he never refused it before—a bad sign that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure; an unusual sobriety looks like marriage—an unlucky omen for your Lordship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Secondly, when I pass'd the Colonel's house, I observed the great gun, that used to be in the dog-ken∣nel, was haul'd out before his door, by way of defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can be more probable—he expects an attack, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thirdly, upon the grass-plot before the
<PB N="29" REF="37" MS="y"/>
parlour-window, what shou'd I see, but his old regimental waistcoat and breeches laying out to air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, there's certainly a something in the wind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, fourthly, the stag's horns are taken down before the gate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a trait of the batchelor remaining—Why, your Lordship will lose the honour of providing for the lady—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad zooks! after all the trouble—hem! hem! I have had, and the secrecy I have kept—to be disappointed—hem!—no respect to a man of fashion! hem! Zounds! I will know where she is gone to—that old fool, Sir Gregory Glovetop, shall inform me why he dar'd turn a lady out of his house that I set my heart upon: hem! hem!—pray, gentlemen, excuse the warmth of my constitution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, my Lord—be more tranquil—the old English constitution was not disturb'd in this manner; besides, I dare say, things are but half so bad as they are related; for I make no doubt but the Captain saw double the whole time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Mr. Loveless—Sir, you who are a man of gallantry; think of the hardship of a beautiful young woman, taught—hem! hem!—taught prudence by an old fellow just at the very last moment—hem! hem!</P>
<STAGE>(coughs violently.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swagger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arrah now, my dear Lord, it will be <HI>your last</HI> moment, if you put yourself into these passions about the women—for my part, I always advise following the ladies without any passion at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>The coolest advice, Captain, I ever heard in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlemen, excuse me—you see I'm overcome by the difficulty of—hem! hem!—a constitu∣tional
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
warmth—but your leave for a while—pray make free with every thing in my house—hem!—my sister and Miss Penelope will be glad to be treated without cere∣mony!—hem!—but, hem!—Zounds!—I'll revenge this prudery by ruining the whole sex.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit coughing and muttering.</STAGE>

<P><STAGE>(calling after him)</STAGE> Upon my shoul the sex won't have much to fear—they can ruin your Lordship much easier. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Loveless—do you not think your er∣rors more venial, when you see such characters as Lord Hectic's—libertines against nature, and vicious without even the excuses of inclination?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my friend, I am too incorrigible in my repentance to receive any consolation from the follies of others—nay more, do you know that I am Quixote enough in virtue to wish that Lord Hectic may be dis∣appointed in his schemes, and even to feel interested that he should?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>I too am a convert to your sentiments,—my friend's continued dejection, while it grieves my heart▪ corrects it.—I look upon the atchievements of gallantry with less ardor than heretofore; and I can conceive it full as inglorious to rob youth and innocence of its peace, as to pilfer the property of my neighbour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you then wonder at my sensibility for this ill-fated fair one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Louisa!—did you but know her▪ you would indeed be interested in her favour.—A beautiful young widow▪ left with an infant child, in circumstances the most humiliating.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, she is really a woman of cha∣racter, whose afflictions are her only crimes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, Loveless, I believe so—I have often seen and convers'd with her at Sir Gregory's;
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
and I confess, in spite of my natural levity, I always respected the sadness that seem'd to weigh her down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Belcour, if such is her situation, it would be criminal even to suffer any aggravation of her misfortunes;—to be a passive spectator of the distress we can alleviate, is unpardonable in any man—but it is cowardice in the extreme to remain unmov'd, when the virtuous sorrows of an afflicted woman demand our assistance. <STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE></P>

<P>And have you the confidence to say, that the lady said nothing?</P>

<P>And please your worship, what could she say better? for I mention'd every thing that was to be said in your honour's favour.—Ma'am, says I—you don't know what you hesitate about—a great justice, and a good officer—understands the rules of the army—and has written a book about law—not very young indeed—but then has a flashy appearance—never in a passion in his whole life.—Such a temper, there's no describing it.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Pickaxe, you were right to say, I was of a mild disposition—it goes a great way with the ladies—and as for the men—death and fury! I should like to see him who durst deny it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure I am not the man to do it—sub∣mission

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop! I never take advice but on the parade, or at the quarter-sessions—there, indeed—on the bench a justice may submit to counsel—but, zounds! I flatter myself I can attack and subdue the ladies without any advice at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pickaxe.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the sooner you do both the better; for I heard it whisper'd, as how Madam Louisa was about to leave the country—ah, your honour, tho' she affects to take on, and to hold herself up—all is not as it should be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold herself up!—I like her the better for it—I'll tell you what, Pickaxe, as the attendant of wealth and prosperity, there is nothing so insulting as pride; but, in more humble fortune, it supports the cha∣racter: and, damn me, may I never swear an oath, if I shall not be more flatter'd with her affection, shou'd I find her pride the only support she has;—so I'm deter∣min'd to marry her immediately. <STAGE>(Going.</STAGE></P>

<P>Don't provoke me—I tell you she must, she shall, consent▪ besides, has not she given me a thousand proofs of her regard?

<P>Ah! that's neither here nor there.</P>

<P>Well, Colonel, if said lady is willing, as the law supposes she is, we have nothing to do but to put her in instead of the blank: favour me, if you please, with her description, spinster or widow, and residing in what parish—come, we can settle the business imme∣diately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! Master Janus, you are the only lawyer I ever knew in my life in a hurry to settle any business, except his bill: what signifies where and what the lady is?—probably she has no parish—perhaps she has—perhaps I may chuse to marry—and perhaps I don't chuse to marry at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true.—I remember a case, George the 1st. Strange's Reports, folio 22, page 231—if <HI>A.</HI> will marry <HI>B.</HI>—and <HI>B</HI> refuses.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>According to the devil!—What, am I not one of the Bench, and don't I understand Magna Charta, and Burn's Justice, and all that, as well as you? Blood and confusion! am I to be instructed in the law of the land, and in the practice about women, at my time of life, by a pettifogging attorney?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Colonel, I hope no offence—but you desired me to draw up your marriage settlement, and here it is: how should I imagine you wanted to conceal the lady's name? Besides, the law knows no concealment, except in its practice.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if you mean to insult me, I do recollect who you are. I know you are half a justice, half a sol∣dier—that you strut about with a cockade in your hat, and a law-book under your arm.</P>

<P>Go on, Sir—You are but an attorney, and therefore would disgrace the vengeance of my arm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, an old gentleman too, that fancies him∣self in love, and thinks he is going to be married—sends for an honest attorney to draw up the settlement—and then don't know who he is to be married to.</P>

<STAGE>Enter <HI>BELCOUR</HI> and <HI>LOVELESS,</HI> meeting.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BELCOUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, Loveless, convinc'd by your arguments, I have at length summon'd resolution enough to write a farewell letter to Harriot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, Belcour, you will applaud your∣self for every resolution which tends to secure your honour and your peace.—An unworthy conquest wou'd have given you a thousand times more real sorrow, than even the surrender of your dearest wishes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely;—but, upon my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul, I find it much less difficult to give advice than to take it.—I per∣suaded you to forget your Julia with great courage; but I cannot forsake this little gipsey of my own, without a thousand pangs that I blush to shew you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that case, my dear friend, why forget her at all?—My advice was to forego a guilty, not an honest pursuit.—Sacrifice to a worthy and ingenuous passion the false suggestions of pride; and meet the contemptible scoffs of the ignorant and unfeeling with the real feli∣city of having satisfied your own heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I would—but consider my situation—I shall incur the certain displeasure of my uncle, and the relinquishing of all his possessions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what have I gain'd by the attainment of mine? What joys have wealth and splendour brought to me?—an unhappy union with a woman, whose only merits they were—and a base desertion of another, whose
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
ingenuous modesty and native charms ever would have fix'd my heart—<Q>“whose tenderness and faithful love, wou'd have endear'd to me life's active day, and sweetly solaced its declining years.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! spare me, Loveless—spare us both;—a thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mes have I reproach'd myself with writing the letter I sent this morning—but I trust to her generosity even against myself—she will not wish me, I think, to sa∣crifice—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you look upon it as a sacrifice, Belcour, I have done; I wou'd not wish her to pass her days with a man who might possibly suffer them to be embittered by regret. So let us turn our thoughts to her poor friend Louisa; there, perhaps, our endeavours may be of some service. For love, that seems to be a foe to both of us, shall there give place to friendship's surer joys.</P>

<P>O dear, good Mr. Belcour—pray Sir—a word if you please.—But I beg this gentleman's pardon for be∣ing so bold.</P>

<P>Speak, Anna—how does Louisa?—where is your mistress?—I have been searching for her far and near, and was this moment lamenting that I had not been able to find out her retreat.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, like enough; like enough—but times are sadly altered with us since you last saw my lady at Sir

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(confused)</STAGE> Indeed I do not—nor have I been there lately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anna.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!—Well, sure that's wonderful—pray don't think me impertinent before this gentleman—but I hope you have a regard for that young lady, as I am sure she has for you; for I have often seen her shed a power of tears, when my dear mistress only said it was possible you might forsake her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(confused)</STAGE> Did she indeed shed tears?—But you don't answer our enquiries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be sure, we have had a sad change: and I know you wou'd pity my poor lady, and her sweet little boy too—if she leaves him, I shall be the only friend he has on earth; and my friendship, God help me! sig∣nifies little.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(emphatically)</STAGE> Where is the child?—bring me to him—while I live he shall not want a father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, indeed, now you are very kind; for something my lady has just heard determin'd her to leave this part of the country immediately.—She had, indeed, thought of taking a journey before, but now she talks of never seeing me again.—O Mr. Belcour! you and Miss Harriet were her friends—pray endeavour to prevent her going—I'm sure I can never bear to part with so kind and good a lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor shall you part with her, if my inter∣ference can be of use.—My friend Loveless too shall join his entreaties to mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loveless!—sure▪ Sir, I think I have heard my lady mention such a name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>My name!—heard your mistress mention my name!—impossible—I never was in this country before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, perhaps I was mistaken; for I have heard her mention it but once, to complain of some such

person—I suppose it was a relation who had used her ill—for indeed she has met with a great many enemies, and I am sure she never deserv'd one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us then haste to rescue her from further distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ah! Sir!—you are very good—perhaps you have a lady and children of your own, that you love and cherish, and who have never known what it is to want a husband and a father.</P>

<P>You'll find my poor lady at the white cottage, near Colonel Quorum's, by the wood-side; but (I ask pardon for being so bold) I am afraid my mistress will not chuse to receive a visit from a stranger, though she may from Mr. Belcour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be alarm'd, Anna—be assured we will neither of us impertinently intrude—but I feel moved at her distress; exasperated against the authors of it; and, as far as friendship allows, I am determined to protect her in∣fant and herself. <STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE></P>

<P>You request an interview—can I refuse it to a gentleman in whom I have ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k'd an amiable repugnance towards the ordinary class▪ of females, and whose conceptions, I am led to think, move in a higher sphere?

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Penelope Zodiac.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Well, here's the art of love turned into science, for the sake of Colonel Quorum—one of the oldest scholars I know of. I dare say, now, if she was here, she would deny her own hand-writing. There's nothing I detest so much, as saying first one thing and then another.—Here she comes, a hypocritical creature.—My dearest friend, I have been languishing for you this half hour.</P>

<P>I too, my lady, have quitted my studies some time, in hopes to enjoy a little relaxed intercourse.

<P>True, Miss Penelope—I have a head for finding out secrets too—You indeed are too prudent to let any body discover your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I believe no person is more dis∣creet—but to the point—You must know then, my dear Lady Betty, that odious woman, that Louisa, on being

dismissed from Sir Gregory's, has had the confidence to seat herself by Colonel Quorum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Colonel Quorum!—Ah! I suppose she thought herself safe by the side of justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she shall find herself mistaken—<HI>You</HI> shall not be imposed upon in that manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I imposed upon, Miss Pen!—Don't be uneasy on that head—believe me, I see through the whole design.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides too, the Colonel is a mighty good sort of a man, and should not be led astray by so artful a minx as she is.—I cannot help disliking her, merely on your account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive you can't—and am exceedingly obliged to you for the warmth you express merely <HI>on my account:</HI> but, though you wish me to be apprehensive for Colonel Quorum, upon my word I don't see the necessity for it, as I dare say he has not the least regard for any female living.</P>

<P>Yes, I was certain you would agree with me—however the Colonel, I believe, might be trusted:

<P>Dear Ma'am, I beg ten thousand pardons.—Indeed I could not have imagined I should have affected you so much—and, had I known your attachment to Colonel Quorum, I am sure I should have been the last person in the world to have mentioned it—for I hate be∣ing ill-natured, you know I do.—I am glad I have pu∣nished her hypocrisy. <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE></P>

<P>Ladies, may I intreat permission to intrude?—I come in behalf of distress, to plead a female cause, and sue to you for pity:—I am told, Lady Betty, you know the unfortunate Louisa, and are not ignorant of what she has suffered from your brother's pursuits.

<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her friend! <HI>Me</HI> to be her friend! Indeed I detest ill-nature, and never say an unkind word of any

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Lady Betty! And it is those cruel dis∣tinctions, which they who have fortunately never trans∣gressed are too apt to make, that bar the entrance of virtuous society, and cut off the faint hope of repentant error. But here, I understand, there is no cause for this severity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>O to be sure not, Mr. Loveless! And so you think there is no occasion for ladies to know any thing of erudition, and logarithms, and trigonometry—they need do nothing but go about making love, and dreaming of the sensations—oh fie!—If she does not know how a lady ought to conduct herself properly, let her read Plutarch's Lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, if I am rightly informed, the conduct of Louisa is not so reproachable.—Nay, Madam, I am told there is a very respectable gentleman in the neighbourhood, a Colonel Quorum, who has made her an offer of his hand.</P>

<P>Not I, indeed; I never answer for any thing.—To be sure, I do think her handsome—hem! hem!—as every man of gallantry ought—and may have paid her a few little attentions, perfectly innocent as yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Heaven I believe so—but men of your lordship's turn are apt to forget, that in the eyes of the sober part of the world, those innocent attentions have the appearance of criminality, and the offer of them is sometimes as fatal as the success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very sententious and moral, egad!—but really, Colonel, do you expect that a man of fashion, in the heyday of youth and spirits—hem! hem!—as I am, can be stopt, in his pursuit of beauty, by a lecture on morality?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lecture on blood and vengeance, my Lord!—for know, when those pursuits happen to be directed against the innocence which boasts a protector, balls and bombardments! that protection which my arm affords her must first be defeated.</P>

<P>A challenge, as I'm a peer!—hem! hem!—but I take no advantages, Colonel; and for once you shall escape being brought upon your knees before the House for a breach of privilege.—The Captain, however, lays under no such impediment; and, being a plebeian quarrel, may enter into it with propriety.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Wood. <HI>LOUISA'S</HI> Cottage at a Distance.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>LOUISA</HI> in a great agitation, looking back as she advances.</STAGE>
<P>'TIS impossible!—It could not be Loveless, that I discovered just now in the wood—base, per∣fidious man!—cruelly as he has treated me, he wou'd not come hither to insult the misery he has occasioned.—No, 'tis not in nature to be so inhuman;—besides, he is wholly ignorant of my situation.—<Q>“My eyes have cer∣tainly deceiv'd me; and my tortur'd mind, still sadly bent on former scenes, pictures resemblances where none exist.—Yes, dear fatal copy <HI>(taking out a picture)</HI> of him who once possessed my virgin heart; in whose false bosom all my fondest hopes were centered; and whose delusive form, in spite of all my wrongs, I can∣not tear from my remembrance—let me examine thee again.”</Q>—Whoever he was, he seem'd, as I thought, in earnest discourse with Mr. Belcour—they are not yet come out from the wood—I'll endeavour to steal softly through the thicket unobserved, and get a nearer view.</P>
<STAGE>[Retiring a moment.</STAGE>
<STAGE>(Re-enter with a quick pace.)</STAGE>
<P>Ah! whither shall I run?—'Tis he! 'tis the barbarous, unrelenting spoiler.—Oh! unfeeling Loveless!—After having invaded the innocence of my youth; driven me from my native, peaceful home; deprived me of a fa∣ther's fond protection; and exposed me, and your help∣less
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
infant, to all the miseries of want and shame, of per∣secution and contempt—you come, to complete the mea∣sure of your guilt, to rob us of the only little shed that's left us; to triumph o'er our complicated woes, and sport with agony unutterable.—Ye gracious Powers! to what am I reduc'd!—My poor brain will turn.—<Q>“But per∣haps I do him injustice,—perhaps he feels.—O! no; I will not see him—I will not endure his pity—when I must despise his heart. <STAGE>(Starts.)</STAGE> Heavens!—he advances—where, where shall I retreat to?—Alas! the world affords me now no place to hide in!”</Q>—I'll fly then—beg, starve, do any thing, rather than bear the presence of a man I ought for ever to detest—<STAGE>(Runs, looking back, then stops)</STAGE> but see, they separate; and Mr. Belcour approaches alone.—I will endeavour to compose myself—shou'd he be informed of my situation, he will have learned, at least, that intentional guilt has never caused these tears to flow.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> BELCOUR.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive, Madam, my freedom, in thus break∣ing in upon your retirement: but let me hope the motive may plead for its excuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(hesitating)</STAGE> Mr. Belcour's conduct, I flatter myself, will never need excuse. I thought I saw you with another gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, with my friend, Mr. Loveless.—He wanted much to offer his good services; but, being a stranger, wou'd not venture so far without permission; he has therefore retired for the present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am easy again. <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>—Mr. Belcour, I thank you for your attention—but, at present, solitude is what I seek for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am aware, Madam, you may feel a re∣pugnance in committing your cares to one so little con∣nected with you as myself—but be assured, tho' only an acquaintance, I feel all the sympathy of friendship; and,
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
knowing the story of your griefs, wish sincerely to remove them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(alarm'd)</STAGE> Then I am lost indeed! <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> What, Sir, has the gentleman, Mr. Loveless—has he communicated any thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Loveless communicated, Madam!—my friend Loveless, as a man of probity and feeling, is, in∣deed, interested in your cause;—but he knows your suf∣ferings only from report, nor has he communicated any thing that can give you uneasiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon, Mr. Belcour, for the suppo∣sition.—But I know the ill-nature of the world, and I thought something might have been said—that the gentle∣man you were with might—but perhaps I am mis∣taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, if you knew my friend as I do—were you acquainted with the goodness of his heart, and the tenderness of his nature, you would be sensible of the high opinion he entertains of your desert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hold myself obliged for the good opinion of every one.—But, Sir, we find ourselves sometimes de∣ceived—appearances are not—however it is not for me to be interested about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, he reprobates Lord Hectic's con∣duct as much as myself; and both of us feel for the in∣convenience it has subjected you to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Mr. Belcour! I have too long walked hand in hand with sorrow, to feel much concern for any incon∣venience;—Lord Hectic has been troublesome to me, I own, but he is not the man that I am most apprehensive of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Madam, assure yourself I am your friend—I see Lord Hectic's conduct has involved you in distress;—indeed I blush for the unworthiness of his sen∣timents.—Allow me the task of undeceiving him as to
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
your character, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onvincing him of the impropriety of his pursuits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Belcour, if my Lord Hectic's sentiments were an object of consideration, there is no one I would more gladly employ in that task than yourself;—to be sure every woman of sensibility must feel for injurious suspi∣cions;—but I have learned the lesson of submission; and, while I thank you for your attention, Sir, believe me when I assure you my distresses are of such a nature, that even your kindness can give me no relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Madam, my fortune at present is narrow, tho' my good wishes towards you are unbound∣ed;—but I am certain Mr. Loveless, whose mind is en∣larged as his circumstances are ample, will gladly supply every deficiency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, Sir—want of fortune is not what I allude to;—but were it so, and rigid penury now stared me in the face,—nothing shou'd induce me to apply there for succour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were you acquainted with my friend, I am certain you wou'd alter your opinion;—his desire to serve you is founded on the noblest principles,—for he is a man, Madam, who, softened by misfortunes of his own, is alive only to the calamity of others.—He has conversed with your servant Anna; has seen your little boy, is charmed with his artless looks and infant prattle; and has commissioned me to request you would commit the care of his youth, and the establishment of his fortune, to his protection and regard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he take notice of my boy?—O nature, how powerful is thy force!—The mother at this moment almost cancels all the past <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>—Exeuse these tears, Sir;—a parent's grateful tribute for her only child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, your son too was equally struck with his attention—sat on his knee, threw his
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
little arms about his neck—embraced him—called him fa∣ther, and said that you wou'd thank him for them both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir!—Your description is more than I can support.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I bring Mr. Loveless to you, Madam? I can easily overtake him, and he will repeat in person the sentiments that do honour to his heart. <STAGE>(going.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, no, Sir—not for the world—I cou'd not bear it.—For myself, my sojourn here will be but short—for my child, tell him 'tis his—I bequeath him to his care: may he regard him with a parent's fondness, and may my boy return it with a filial duty!</P>

fully explained;—Louisa was the sacrifice he could not make—ah! treacherous friend! If such is the treatment we are to expect from those we most esteem, where shall our affections be placed? <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, my dear Mr. Janus, you know my regard for propriety; and therefore, notwithstanding I cannot help feeling for the unhappy wretches of my own sex, yet we must have this creature, who has capti∣vated my brother's affections, removed out of the neigh∣bourhood, no matter how, and I shall depend upon your ingenuity for doing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(bowing)</STAGE> True, my Lady—Burn, in his chap∣ter about nuisances, does mention the women; but I don't recollect he says they can be removed whether they will or no—can your Ladyship remember a case in point?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! Mr. Janus, how should I remem∣ber cases?—I want your assistance; and you must stretch a point as far as you can, to oblige me.—The law, you know, is a wide field.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so, my Lady—it is so—and I don't mind going a little about the edges of it;—but totally to tres∣pass might put me upon the Black List.—However, I'll look into the Attorney's Guide, and see what I can do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Mr. Janus, I know you are a man of integrity, and honest people have their scruples;—but here is the attorney's guide—take and examine it <STAGE>(giving him a purse);</STAGE>—and tho' you should act a little against <STAGE>(he puts out his hand to take it)</STAGE> the letter, yet, in equity, you wou'd undoubtedly be justified.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be sure, your ladyship has set the matter in a new light.—I had forgot equity totally;—and really I can't help seeing it now in the light of a con∣spiracy against your brother.—I remember a case in the rebellion of forty-five—John Jones versus Sandy Maclean—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(interrupting)</STAGE> True, true, good Mr. Janus—I perceive you begin to feel the weight of my argument—it certainly is a conspiracy against my bro∣ther's person, as well as his fortune; and therefore she must on no account be suffered to come near his house.—I think you see the case just as you should do—do me the favour of accepting this <STAGE>(gives a bank note).</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(taking it)</STAGE> Yes, yes, my Lady—I know where to put my finger; and you may rest assured, on the faith of an attorney, the plaintiff shall be nonsuited, and her cause kicked out of court—she shall never get into my Lord's house whilst I live, and in two days she shall be fifty miles from the place.—But hold, my Lady—there is one difficulty has just struck me—there is another attorney in the parish—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. Janus,—what of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my Lady, I think we had better have him likewise. Two of us, I think, will finish the busi∣ness.—Suppose your Ladyship gives me his retaining fee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, Mr. Janus—only spare my feelings, and get the jade removed by fair or foul means, and I shan't mind a little expence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! my Lady, two attornies!—only think of that, and you need not despair of any means whatever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soft—I see my brother coming this way—you must not mention my having been here for the world, or the subject of our discourse—only remember the business. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Ha! my little attorney! what the devil art thou pocketing there so hastily—thy conscience?</P>

<P><STAGE>(confused)</STAGE> No, my Lord, no—thank Heaven, I am not ashamed of my conscience—I only took the liberty of stepping in to enquire after your Lordship's health—I am delighted to see you look so charmingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say thou art—especially as thou wilt get nothing by my death.—But thou art come most luckily, my little vellum-blotter—for I want thy assist∣ance;—thou know'st the woman I was mentioning to thee the other day—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, my Lord, the lady that was at Sir Gregory Glovetop's—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same—hem! hem!—the thought of her warms me. Now I am told she is about to leave this country immediately—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, my Lord—I am prodigiously sorry for it.—This is lucky!—I shall carry her ladyship's cause without bringing it to a trial. <STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, as such a circumstance would anni∣hilate my hopes, that must be prevented immediately; and therefore thou must exert all thy ingenuity to keep her in the neighbourhood—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord! to be sure, if your Lordship wishes it; but how can an attorney prevent a lady from follow∣ing her inclinations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know, on her leaving that old fool, Sir Gregory, she has become, without know∣ing it, tenant to a little cottage of mine, which I learned this morning from my steward—and therefore, on some pretence or other, I would have such difficulties thrown
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
in the way, as may prevent her putting her design in execution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye—payment of rent; which, being an ex∣ceeding neat house, may be exorbitant—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>True—then she may perhaps think of a personal application to me—I step in, and become her guardian angel at once.—You take the matter, heh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I remember a case—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn your cases—pocket that <STAGE>(throws a purse)</STAGE> and fly to execute my plan.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(going, and returns)</STAGE> I do.—She shall be safe in your Lordship's house in less than two hours—but, my Lord, the ladies of a family you know are a little in∣quisitive, sometimes—Now, as I have the honour of transacting business for your Lordship's sister, I hope she will not know a syllable of what I undertake for your Lordship—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I see thou art an honest fellow, and stand up for thy character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do—I do, my Lord—My father always said I was too honest to thrive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>In your profession he meant—but hold, is not there another honest gentleman of your calling in this parish?—You must take care that Louisa gets no ad∣vice about our proceedings—for I do not imagine they will be strictly legal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear him, I have him under my thumb here. <STAGE>(putting his hand on his pocket)</STAGE>—Besides, the gentle∣men in our way are very honourable, and never betray each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there's that fighting Colonel must be taken care of, for he's too honourable by half—and is such an old fool, that he actually wants to marry her, with his infirm constitution—Hem! hem!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Janus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does he so?—Oh, oh! That's the blank he
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
wants to fill up, is it?—I am glad I shall be able to vex him—don't be afraid of his worship, my Lord—I have all my life been used to counteract justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then lose not a moment, for I am all impatience to enjoy the fruits of thy industry;—and hem! hem!—the devil take this cough, I say. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Well, this is a good morning's walk—to satisfy one's interest and one's revenge at the same time, by se∣curing the principal evidence on both sides the question—and I think we need not fear being cross-examined.—I am glad his lordship has employed me in this business, otherwise I must have obeyed her ladyship; but when one is engaged on both sides, one can satisfy one's con∣science, and take that which is most agreeable. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Be not alarm'd, dear Miss Penelope.—Col. Quorum, I am bold to say, wou'd not abuse the kindness of any Lady; and you, Madam, will allow for the feelings of a man in love.—If I can but persuade her to interest herself for me with Louisa, it wou'd go a great way. <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE></P>

<P>YES, the distinction is just, and I feel its force—guilty as I have been, dare I revolt against any epithet of reproach which the father of my Julia here bestows upon me?—Yes, I <HI>have outrag'd</HI> the peace of an innocent family, and call'd Heaven to witness the viola∣tion of its own rites.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The offer of a pecuniary recompence I treat with the contempt it merits, because I find how deeply I have been injured. While I look'd upon my child as a wanton, who yielded to the solicitation, the disho∣nourable
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
solicitation, of a pretended lover, I held her cause beneath the dignity of a soldier's arm; an arm worn in the honourable service of his country, never sullied in the defence of infamy and shame—but when I learn, for the first time, she has been betray'd by a pretended solemnization of marriage, and that she has fallen a victim to that fraud, and my unjust displeasure; every remembrance of my un∣happy child now upbraids the tardiness of my arm—old as I am—and sinking beneath the pressure of my woes, I have <HI>flown</HI> to this spot; and shall only add, that I expect you an hour hence, at the outskirts of the grove.</P>

<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(taking back the letter)</STAGE> Well—is he not right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>The warmth of a parent is natural, and ought to be excused. You, however, must not be pro∣vok'd at it—meeting him would be impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so I have thought—but then, my friend, can I submit to epithets, under which no man ought to live?—Should he stigmatize me as a coward, will the world make allowances for my situation, or be∣lieve that he is the only man on earth I would not meet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would you then so far comply with the false idea which that world calls honour, as to raise your arm against a man already too much injured?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mistake me not—I have no such intention—I have been the aggressor; and 'tis proper, if such is the reparation he wishes, that I shou'd abide its conse∣quence—yes, I will meet him—but without resistance—I shall offer myself a willing victim to his resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Loveless, if such are your resolu∣tions, let me at least go with you—perhaps it may be in my power to convince Captain Hardy, that, notwith∣standing
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
the savage practice we see every day enforced, a duel never yet afforded a recompence for a wrong—life may be taken, but satisfaction will not be obtained: and I submit it to every thinking man, who has unfortunately been led into such a situation, whether, the moment re∣venge was complete, peace of mind was not destroyed? I must insist, therefore, on being permitted to attend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Belcour, that painful task let me excuse you: in these cases an indifferent man is best; for, though it be the task of a friend, it is the last office he should undertake. On this occasion I mean to ask the kindness of Lord Hectic—his sensibility will not suffer as an ac∣quaintance.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unkind Loveless! And can you imagine I shall suffer less, because I am not present?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray spare me. <STAGE>(as going)</STAGE>—One thing, how∣ever, I wish to mention—Should any thing happen, should this be the last time I embrace my friend, the fa∣ther of my Julia will still find I have not forgotten him. The bulk of my fortune, however, you will be the heir to—if therefore a wish for your Harriet still hangs about your heart, let my last request enforce your own appli∣cation, for her to share it with you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belcour.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am overpower'd by your goodness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>One thing more—I have taken the liberty of leaving a small bequest to the lady in whose cause we have interested ourselves: and, according to my promise, have secured the independency of her son.

<P>My Lord, you will doubtless be surprized at so extraordinary a visit, from one whose misfortunes alone are all she has to plead—misfortunes which your Lord∣ship has (I hope unintentionally) very considerably in∣creased. Depressed with cureless griefs, and nearly yield∣ing to a sad despondency, I had found one kind asylum, I had secured one tender friend:—friendship and privacy, the only consolations I could feel, your Lordship's impor∣tunities have deprived me of—but I cannot, will not, sup∣pose your heart has consented to such injurious conduct—and therefore have determined to make this personal appeal to your compassion.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not, Ma'am—I'm the most careful man about a lady's reputation. <STAGE>(shews her into the other room)</STAGE>—Damn this fellow's interruption; what can he want, an impertinent rascal? <STAGE>(opens the door.)</STAGE>—My dear friend, I am very glad to see you—but how the devil could you interrupt a man at such a crisis?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, my Lord, if I have in∣truded—but the case would not admit of delay—I must request your attention for a moment to a very disagree∣able business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orry for it—but I can attend to nothing now, but very pleasant business.—Betwixt our∣selves, there is a lady in the other room—but she desired me not to speak of it—You understand me—when a lady's in the case—hem! hem!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge the privilege—but in one

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! how can I think of an affair of honour, when I have got a fine woman waiting for me—or what wou'd she think of me, if I did?—why, I tell you its the handsome widow that I was mentioning, that you and Belcour were moralizing about—had not you unfortunately broke in upon me—the day had been mine already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really!—Louisa a wanton!—then, indeed, I've been deceived—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be—but I am never deceiv'd about the women. When I pursue, I always succeed.—Look at these pictures, they are my trophies—that frame will soon be filled up—Louisa's ready to sit; pop her in in a week:—but I don't speak out of vanity.—So now, my dear friend, damn your duel, and turn yourself out as quick as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Lord, I will wait your leisure.—Success is the parent of levity, and therefore I excuse yours.—Unthinking Louisa! thus to sacrifice thyself.—Had the angel whom I deceiv'd but resembled thee, how short would have been my regret! <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>I hope, my Lord, you will give no reason to alter the favourable opinion I had begun to form of your humanity; or to repent the resolution, which led me, in a moment of distress, to fly to your Lordship for protection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, my dear Madam, you excel in heroics, and I love them at proper times; but ladies don't visit gentlemen for nothing.—I am a man of fashion and pleasure!—hem! hem!—and I am ambitious to see you at the head of both:—so come, throw aside this—this unnecessary reserve. <STAGE>(Seizing her hand.)</STAGE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, I have got into the wrong box; and I may as well get out of it as soon as I can. <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>—Well, Mr. Loveless, if this is really your Julia, as you call her—I never trespass upon any gentleman's property,

<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me thank Heaven that thou art still alive!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am alive—inhuman Loveless! alive to every wretchedness thy cruelty has heap'd upon me!—betray'd by thee, in youth's unguarded morn—I have liv'd the scorn of my sex, and the sport of your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have indeed been guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My first, my tenderest love being basely sacri∣ficed to sordid interest and mean ambition, I have been forced, with the keen pangs of wounded sensibility, to bear the weight of undeserv'd reproach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! spare me, Julia—look on me as I am, an alter'd man—peace has been a stranger to my bosom, and remorse and sorrow my constant companions, since we parted.—My heart is open but to the charms of virtue, and trembles only at the uncertainty of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My child, thy much-wrong'd child, too cruel man! who now must blush to own his birth, but for thy treachery would have smil'd upon our mutual happiness, and rais'd his infant voice to bless his father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, I feel, severely feel the justice of your complaints! yet I could urge some heart-felt <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighs, I could bring witnesses of some repentant tears; tears which hourly trickled down my cheek, when I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hought the injured excellence, whose memory made
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>
them flow, had long been lost to every earthly recom∣pence.—I lov'd my boy, before I knew he was so. I felt for his mother's wrongs, when I could little suppose myself the sad aggressor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loveless, 'tis now too late to parley—you may awaken remembrance; you can never restore my peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am distracted with a thousand thoughts—I destroy'd thy innocence; yet dread to find it wanting—tell me then, in pity tell me, how it comes, that, after having evaded all my fond enquiries, I now find you in Lord Hectic's own apartments, and studiously concealed at my approach?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; usurp the right which my credulity has given you, to upbraid me with misfortunes which, even at this late period, you have been the cause of.—But for Loveless, Lord Hectic had been unknown.—How∣ever, conscious of no ill, I disclaim justification—and Mr. Loveless is, perhaps, the only man on earth to whom I am not solicitous of appearing innocent; because, himself having lost all that was valuable in my eyes, his approbation now can give me no concern.—I beg, Sir, that I may be permitted to depart. <STAGE>(going.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, I conjure you, stay:—wrong'd as you have been by my crimes, and now, perhaps, wrong'd by my suspicions, deign to forgive a man, whose strong affection has been his guilt:—by every tie of na∣ture I entreat you, hear me; by our son's welfare, by your hopes of happiness hereafter, inform me why you have eluded all my anxious searches, and found me only in these hated rooms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a time when I should not have been suspected on such grounds:—from the tenor of my conduct, even from my enemies, you will learn the
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
injustice you are now guilty of.—But enough of words have pass'd between us.—In the retirement which I shall seek, and which I hope you will not attempt to invade, no reproaches of mine shall wound your ear again. Oh, Loveless!—protect your son—protect my only child—rear him in the paths of honour—teach him to avoid his father's errors—to lament his mother's fate!—So shall my ebbing life know something of content; and my boy's rising virtues shade his parent's faults, when you can wound, and I can weep no more. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I will obey thy injunctions, and not break in upon thy grief.—Every prospect of a reconcilia∣tion is now at an end—what then remains for me?—a father's rage—a father's vengeful sword. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>Fine doings here, indeed, Lady Betty!—so that abominable Louisa has got into the house, at last!—Mercy on us!—What will become of me, as an un∣married lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Miss Penelope, you are in the right to be apprehensive in time;—I had just heard of it from my maid.—If it was not proper that some people should think of title and fortune in a great family, I should actually give my brother up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>Paugh! The very house is tainted with the creature.—But I have lock'd up my room, lest she

should run away with some of my poetry.—Those sort of animals are glad to lay their hands upon any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to your poetry, I believe you need not have been afraid; for such wretches only steal things of value—but, at all events, the hussey must be disposed of;—I shall consult my attorney immediately—in the mean time, do me the favour to look thro' the key-hole of my Lord's library, and observe what's going for∣ward.</P>

<P>I look thro' the key-hole!—Heaven knows what I may be witness to!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear friend, throw aside these scruples—nobody will suspect you, as you are a learned lady, you know, and not supposed to think about such things. But my brother wou'd never forgive me, tho' I do it entirely out of kindness to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you really thought there wou'd be no harm in it, why I wou'd give a peep—merely tho' to oblige you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, Lady Betty, to be trou∣blesome—but I have been informed, that a lawyer, on your account, has given great uneasiness to a lady for whom I have a most profound regard. <STAGE>(seeing Miss Penelope)</STAGE>—Miss Penelope, I ask ten thousand par∣dons, I did not intend to mention my attachments any more in your company, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg, Colonel, you will not address your improper discourse to me; as I'm an unmarried woman, and cannot possibly hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if my lawyer has been guilty of any
<PB N="84" REF="92"/>
severity against the person in question, he did not per∣haps know that Colonel Quorum was not very inqui∣sitive about the <HI>character</HI> of the ladies for whom he profess'd a regard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>The devil, Madam!—I ask pardon for swearing; but, zounds! her character has been misre∣presented—and your Ladyship's usage has driven her from the friends that value her, to seek shelter, perhaps, in solitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes:—at least, if she's not alone, I dare say she has not above one person with her.—Ha! Lady Betty!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>One person!—who knows, but she is now wandering thro' woods and wilds, friendless and unattended, and her tender frame exposed to every hardship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't say what her tender frame may be exposed to; but I am sure, if she is wandering thro' woods and wilds, she has met with them in my Lord's library.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my honour, I can't comprehend what your Ladyship means; but sure, after the impor∣tunities she had already withstood from your brother—she deserved every respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are you so certain she has withstood those importunities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Confusion, Madam!—permit me to in∣form you, that she has withstood the most honourable temptations; I only wish that she might appear, to con∣found all the ill-natur'd surmises of her enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Colonel, if you are so desirous of her appearing, I believe you have nothing in the world to do, but to open that door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Quorum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds!—'tis impossible!—and if I thought so, I'd have the Posse Comitatus, and bring her

to light immediately—I have already dispatch'd my clerk, with a search-warrant and two field-pieces, to Sir Gregory Glovetop's; and by Heavens I'll leave no corner unsearch'd!—nay, I'll break the door open my∣self;—am I not a justice of peace? and don't I know the law upon these matters?</P>

and therefore I hope I am not too late for a second—The ladies here!—Oh—hem!—then Mars must yield to Ve∣nus.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> LADY BETTY <HI>and</HI> MISS PENELOPE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother's voice!—then I am sure the odious creature is not far off, and I dare say encircled with the men too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Penelope.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, always wand'ring into another person's sphere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hardy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray who are these <HI>good-natured</HI> ladies, that are pleas'd to make such <HI>kind</HI> observations on my daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Hectic.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of these ladies I have the honour to call sister, and the other is a virgin aunt of this gen∣tleman—but I really can't answer for either of their <HI>good∣nature.</HI> However, Madam, as you are now in the possession of my friend Loveless—who I told you was a good sort of man, only a little formal, I will give up my pretensions, and fairly confess you are in better hands.—Ah! that frame must remain vacant, I see. <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I thank you, and if you will per∣mit me to offer you and these ladies one word of advice, it would be, that, while you desisted from attempting to give cause for scandal, they should relinquish exercising it without any cause at all.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> SIR GREGORY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, child, you have broke through all etiquette, and actually been forward enough to step out of my house with a gentleman, perhaps of no precedence at all, and without a pedigree!—I should have been exceed∣ingly angry, but I never am vex'd before good company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveless.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Gregory, Mr. Belcour is my friend, and his rank and fortune will entitle him, I believe, in your
<PB N="91" REF="99"/>
opinion, to pardon at court—and now let me introduce you to a lady, formerly an acquaintance of your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Gregory.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Louisa!—very true—one of the hous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣hold, I protest—ah I said, if she had a proper idea of conse∣quence, and got quit of sorrow and affection, and all that, she would do very well yet—and my little fellow here shall be a page after all—and I'll keep my promise, and teach him the true court-step myself—ha! ha!—Soft and majestic, with a little grace upon the toe. <STAGE>(moving about)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir Gregory—you have been somewhat wanting in politeness to me, but I forgive you.—Restored to objects dearer to me than life, I can have no right to complain.</P>
</SP>
<LG>
<L>Surrounded thus with all that life can give</L>
<L>To warm my heart, and make me wish to live▪</L>
<L>Charm'd with the generous friends, who, circled here,</L>
<L>Feel for each pang, and give me tear for tear,</L>
<L>Be it mine to thank them for their tender cares,</L>
<L>And let my future hours be wholly theirs▪</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by MISS FARREN.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By EDWARD TOPHAM, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>FIVE dismal acts consum'd in lamentation,</L>
<L>Our Author marries me for Reparation!</L>
<L>—Well—tho' we women are, as grey-beards say,</L>
<L>In duty bound to love and to obey;</L>
<L>And, tho' beset with cares of brats and strife,</L>
<L><HI>Repent</HI> is still the lot of married life;</L>
<L>With less dismay I meet the awful sentence,</L>
<L>Since wedlock puts an end to <HI>my</HI> repentance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From this bright hour shall gayer scenes arise,</L>
<L>Such as may charm a female patriot's eyes,</L>
<L>Whose great ambition s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars to nobler plans</L>
<L>Than goat's-beard tippets, or than <HI>Marlbrou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> fans:</L>
<L>Whose taste the rage for Opera can defy,</L>
<L>And bear to live—tho' <HI>Pacchierotti</HI> die:</L>
<L>With strange ill-bred indifference can view</L>
<L><HI>VESTRIS</HI> on one leg, or—<HI>the Dogs</HI> on two.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But as we women are forbid to roam,</L>
<L>And though we will speak last—must speak at home—</L>
<L>To spouse I delegate my vocal powers,</L>
<L>He knows my voice—and hears it at all hours—</L>
<L>Thus, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t in hand, and poiz'd upon one leg,</L>
<L><HI>He'll start with</HI>—"Mr. Speaker!—Sir—I beg</L>
<L>"One word."—"Oh, hear him! hear him!—I defy</L>
<L>"The honourable member in my eye."</L>
<L>Then o'er the Indian plains his forces rally,</L>
<L><HI>Rave about</HI> TIPPOO SAIB <HI>and</HI> HEYDER ALLY;</L>
<L>While I, the member's wife, shall bear a shawl</L>
<L>Given by some ponderous pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of Leadenhall:</L>
<L>Or, up all night, with fresh impatience wait,</L>
<L>To read next noon the Chronicled debate;</L>
<L>Where, in good style, and better words convey'd,</L>
<L>Spouse wonders at the speeches he has made,</L>
<L>And, with the borrow'd grace enamour'd grown,</L>
<L>Stares o'er the tropes and figures—not his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is the potent spell that all bewitches—</L>
<L>"For who would fardels bear,"—that could make speeches?</L>
<L>"Who brook th' oppressor's wrong—the proud man's eye,"</L>
<L>When he might rise again—with, <HI>I reply?</HI></L>
<L>"Or who would groan beneath life's weary prate,"</L>
<L>Who quietly might sleep thro' a debate?</L>
<L>But—there are charms from oratory flow,</L>
<L>Which those who only hear, can never know.</L>
<L>Yet, lest I press too long the speaker's art,</L>
<L>Pass me your vot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of thanks—and I depart.</L>
