<HEAD>VARIETY. A TALE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Gentle Maid, of rural breeding,</L>
<L>By Nature first, and then by reading,</L>
<L>Was fill'd with all those soft sensations</L>
<L>Which we restrain in near relations,</L>
<L>Lest future husbands should be jealous,</L>
<L>And think their wives too fond of fellows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morning sun beheld her rove</L>
<L>A Nymph, or Goddess of the grove!</L>
<L>At eve she pac'd the dewy lawn,</L>
<L>And call'd each clown she saw, a faun!</L>
<L>Then, scudding homeward, lock'd her door,</L>
<L>And turn'd some copious volume o'er.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>For much she read; and chiefly those</L>
<L>Great Authors, who in verse, or prose,</L>
<L>Or something betwixt both, unwind</L>
<L>The secret springs which move the mind.</L>
<L>These much she read; and thought she knew</L>
<L>The human heart's minutest clue;</L>
<L>Yet shrewd observers still declare,</L>
<L>(To show how shrewd observers are)</L>
<L>Tho' Plays, which breath'd heroic flame,</L>
<L>And Novels, in profusion, came,</L>
<L>Imported fresh and fresh from France,</L>
<L>She only read the heart's Romance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The World, no doubt, was well enough</L>
<L>To smooth the manners of the rough;</L>
<L>Might please the giddy and the vain,</L>
<L>Those tinsell'd slaves of Folly's train.</L>
<L>But, for her part, the truest taste</L>
<L>She found was in retirement plac'd,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>Where, as in verse it sweetly flows,</L>
<L>"On every thorn instruction grows."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not that she wish'd to "be alone,"</L>
<L>As some affected Prudes have done;</L>
<L>She knew it was decreed on high</L>
<L>We should "increase and multiply;"</L>
<L>And therefore, if kind Fate would grant</L>
<L>Her fondest wish, her only want,</L>
<L>A cottage with the man she lov'd</L>
<L>Was what her gentle heart approv'd;</L>
<L>In some delightful solitude</L>
<L>Where step profane might ne'er intrude;</L>
<L>But Hymen guard the sacred ground,</L>
<L>And <HI>virtuous</HI> Cupids hover round.</L>
<L>Not such as flutter on a fan</L>
<L>Round Crete's vile bull, or Leda's swan;</L>
<L>(Who scatter myrtles, scatter roses,</L>
<L>And hold their fingers to their noses.)</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>But simp'ring, mild, and innocent</L>
<L>As Angels on a monument.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fate heard her pray'r: a Lover came,</L>
<L>Who felt, like her, th' innoxious flame;</L>
<L>One who had trod, as well as she,</L>
<L>The flow'ry paths of Poesy;</L>
<L>Had warm'd himself with Milton's heat,</L>
<L>Could ev'ry line of Pope repeat,</L>
<L>Or chaunt, in Shenstone's tender strains,</L>
<L>"The Lover's hopes," "the Lover's pains."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Attentive to the Charmer's tongue,</L>
<L>With <HI>him</HI> she thought no ev'ning long;</L>
<L>With <HI>him</HI> she saunter'd half the day;</L>
<L>And sometimes, in a laughing way,</L>
<L>Ran o'er the Catalogue by rote</L>
<L>Of who might marry, and who not.</L>
<L>Consider, Sir, we're near relations—</L>
<L>I hope so in our inclinations. —</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>In short, she look'd, she blush'd consent;</L>
<L>He grasp'd her hand, to church they went;</L>
<L>And ev'ry matron that was there,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With tongue so voluble and supple,</L>
<L>Said, for her part, she must declare</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She never saw a finer couple.</L>
<L>O Halcyon days! 'Twas Nature's reign,</L>
<L>'Twas Tempe's vale, and Enna's plain.</L>
<L>The fields assum'd unusual bloom,</L>
<L>And ev'ry zephyr breath'd perfume.</L>
<L>The laughing Sun with genial beams</L>
<L>Danc'd lightly on th' exulting streams;</L>
<L>And the pale Regent of the night</L>
<L>In dewy softness shed delight.</L>
<L>'Twas Transport not to be exprest;</L>
<L>'Twas Paradise!—But mark the rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Two smiling Springs had wak'd the flow'rs</L>
<L>That paint the meads, or fringe the bow'rs,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>(Ye Lovers, lend your wond'ring ears,</L>
<L>Who count by months, and not by years)</L>
<L>Two smiling Springs had chaplets wove</L>
<L>To crown their solitude, and Love:</L>
<L>When lo, they find, they can't tell how,</L>
<L>Their walks are not so pleasant now.</L>
<L>The seasons sure were chang'd; the place</L>
<L>Had, some how, got a diff'rent face.</L>
<L>Some blast had struck the chearful scene;</L>
<L>The lawns, the woods were not so green.</L>
<L>The purling rill, which murmur'd by,</L>
<L>And once was liquid harmony,</L>
<L>Became a sluggish, reedy pool:</L>
<L>The days grew hot, the ev'nings cool.</L>
<L>The Moon with all the starry reign</L>
<L>Were Melancholy's silent train.</L>
<L>And then the tedious winter night—</L>
<L>They could not read by candle light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<L>Full oft, unknowing why they did,</L>
<L>They call'd in adventitious aid.</L>
<L>A faithful, fav'rite Dog ('twas thus</L>
<L>With Tobit, and Telemachus)</L>
<L>Amus'd their steps; and for a while</L>
<L>They view'd his gambols with a smile.</L>
<L>The Kitten too was comical,</L>
<L>She play'd so oddly with her tail,</L>
<L>Or in the glass was pleas'd to find</L>
<L>Another cat, and peep'd behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A courteous neighbour at the door</L>
<L>Was deem'd intrusive noise no more.</L>
<L>For rural visits, now and then,</L>
<L>Are right, as men must live with men.</L>
<L>Then cousin Jenny, fresh from town,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A new recruit, a dear delight!</L>
<L>Made many a heavy hour go down,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At morn, at noon, at eve, at night:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>Sure they could hear her jokes for ever,</L>
<L>She was so sprightly, and so clever!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet neighbours were not quite the thing;</L>
<L>What joy, alas! could converse bring</L>
<L>With awkward creatures, bred at home—</L>
<L>The Dog grew dull, or troublesome.</L>
<L>The Cat had spoil'd the Kitten's merit,</L>
<L>And, with her youth, had lost her spirit.</L>
<L>And jokes, repeated o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>Had quite exhausted Jenny's store.</L>
<L>—"And then, my dear, I can't abide</L>
<L>"This always saunt'ring side by side."—</L>
<L>Enough, he cries! the reason's plain.</L>
<L>For causes never rack your brain.</L>
<L>Our neighbours are like other folks,</L>
<L>Skip's playful tricks, and Jenny's jokes</L>
<L>Are still delightful, still would please</L>
<L>Were we, my dear, ourselves at ease.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>Look round, with an impartial eye,</L>
<L>On yonder fields, on yonder sky;</L>
<L>The azure cope, the flow'rs below,</L>
<L>With all their wonted colours glow.</L>
<L>The rill still murmurs; and the moon</L>
<L>Shines, as she did, a softer sun.</L>
<L>No change has made the seasons fail,</L>
<L>No comet brush'd us with his tail.</L>
<L>The scene's the same, the same the weather—</L>
<L>WE LIVE, MY DEAR, TOO MUCH TOGETHER.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Agreed. a rich old uncle dies,</L>
<L>And added wealth the means supplies.</L>
<L>With eager haste to Town they flew,</L>
<L>Where all must please, for all was new.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But here, by strict poetic laws,</L>
<L>Description claims it's proper pause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<L>The rosy Morn had rais'd her head</L>
<L>From old Tithonus' saffron bed;</L>
<L>And embrio sunbeams from the East,</L>
<L>Half chok'd, were struggling thro' the mist,</L>
<L>When forth advanc'd the gilded chaise.</L>
<L>The village crowded round to gaze.</L>
<L>The pert postilion, now promoted</L>
<L>From driving plough, and neatly booted,</L>
<L>His jacket, cap, and baldric on,</L>
<L>(As greater folks than he have done)</L>
<L>Look'd round; and, with a coxcomb air,</L>
<L>Smack'd loud his lash. The happy pair</L>
<L>Bow'd graceful, from a sep'rate door,</L>
<L>And Jenny, from the stool before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Roll swift, ye wheels! to willing eyes</L>
<L>New objects ev'ry moment rise.</L>
<L>Each carriage passing on the road,</L>
<L>From the broad waggon's pond'rous load</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>To the light car, where mounted high</L>
<L>The giddy driver seems to fly,</L>
<L>Were themes for harmless satire fit,</L>
<L>And gave fresh force to Jenny's wit.</L>
<L>Whate'er occurr'd, 'twas all delightful,</L>
<L>No noise was harsh, no danger frightful.</L>
<L>The dash and splash thro' thick and thin,</L>
<L>The hair-breadth scapes, the bustling inn,</L>
<L>(Where well-bred landlords were so ready</L>
<L>To welcome in the squire and lady.)</L>
<L>Dirt, dust, and sun, they bore with ease,</L>
<L>Determin'd to be pleas'd, and please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now nearer Town and all agog</L>
<L>They know dear London by it's fog.</L>
<L>Bridges they cross, thro' lanes they wind,</L>
<L>Leave Hounslow's dang'rous heath behind,</L>
<L>Thro' Brentford win a passage free</L>
<L>By roaring, Wilkes and Liberty!</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>At Knightsbridge bless the short'ning way,</L>
<L>(Where Bays's troops in ambush lay)</L>
<L>O'er Piccadilly's pavement glide,</L>
<L>(With palaces to grace it's side)</L>
<L>'Till Bond-street with it's lamps a-blaze</L>
<L>Concludes the journey of three days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why should we paint, in tedious song,</L>
<L>How ev'ry day, and all day long,</L>
<L>They drove at first with curious haste</L>
<L>Thro' Lud's vast town; or, as they pass'd</L>
<L>Midst risings, fallings, and repairs</L>
<L>Of streets on streets, and squares on squares,</L>
<L>Describe how strong their wonder grew</L>
<L>At buildings — and at builders too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce less astonishment arose</L>
<L>At architects more fair than those—</L>
<L>Who built as high, as widely spread</L>
<L>Th' enormous loads that cloath'd their head.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>For British dames new follies love,</L>
<L>And, if they can't invent, improve.</L>
<L>Some with erect Pagodas vie,</L>
<L>Some nod, like Pisa's tow'r, awry,</L>
<L>Medusa's snakes, with Pallas' crest,</L>
<L>Convolv'd, contorted, and compress'd;</L>
<L>With intermingling trees, and flow'rs,</L>
<L>And corn, and grass, and shepherds' bow'rs,</L>
<L>Stage above stage the turrets run,</L>
<L>Like pendent groves of Babylon,</L>
<L>'Till nodding from the topmost wall</L>
<L>Otranto's plumes envelop all!</L>
<L>Whilst the black ewes, who own'd the hair,</L>
<L>Feed harmless on, in pastures fair,</L>
<L>Unconscious that <HI>their</HI> tails perfume,</L>
<L>In scented curls, the Drawing-room.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Night her murky pinions spread,</L>
<L>And sober folks retir'd to bed,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>To ev'ry public place they flew,</L>
<L>Where Jenny told them who was who.</L>
<L>Money was always at command,</L>
<L>And tripp'd with Pleasure hand in hand.</L>
<L>Money was equipage, was show,</L>
<L>Gallini's, Almack's, and Soho;</L>
<L>The <HI>passe par tout</HI> thro' ev'ry vein</L>
<L>Of Dissipation's hydra reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O London, thou prolific source,</L>
<L>Parent of Vice, and Folly's nurse!</L>
<L>Fruitful as Nile thy copious springs</L>
<L>Spawn hourly births,—and all with stings:</L>
<L>But happiest far the He, or She,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I know not which, that livelier dunce</L>
<L>Who first contriv'd the Coterie,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To crush domestic bliss at once.</L>
<L>Then grinn'd, no doubt, amidst the dames,</L>
<L>As Nero fiddled to the flames.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<L>Of thee, Pantheon, let me speak</L>
<L>With rev'rence, tho' in numbers weak;</L>
<L>Thy beauties Satire's frown beguile,</L>
<L>We spare the follies for the pile.</L>
<L>Flounc'd, furbelow'd, and trick'd for show,</L>
<L>With lamps above, and lamps below,</L>
<L>Thy charms even modern taste defy'd,</L>
<L>They could not spoil thee, tho' they try'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah pity that Time's hasty wings</L>
<L>Must sweep thee off with vulgar things!</L>
<L>Let architects of humbler name</L>
<L>On <HI>frail</HI> materials build their fame,</L>
<L>Their noblest works the world might want—</L>
<L>WYATT should build in adamant.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what are these to scenes which lie</L>
<L>Secreted from the vulgar eye,</L>
<L>And baffle all the pow'rs of song?—</L>
<L>A brazen throat, an iron tongue</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="17"/>(Which poets wish for, when at length</L>
<L>Their subject soars above their strength)</L>
<L>Would shun the task. Our humbler Muse,</L>
<L>(Who only reads the public news,</L>
<L>And idly utters what she gleans</L>
<L>From chronicles and magazines)</L>
<L>Recoiling feels her feeble fires,</L>
<L>And blushing to her shades retires.</L>
<L>Alas! she knows not how to treat</L>
<L>The finer follies of the Great,</L>
<L>Where ev'n, Democritus, thy sneer</L>
<L>Were vain, as Heraclitus' tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Suffice it that by just degrees</L>
<L>They reach'd all heighths, and rose with ease;</L>
<L>(For Beauty wins it's way, uncall'd,</L>
<L>And ready dupes are ne'er black-ball'd.)</L>
<L>Each gambling Dame She knew, and He</L>
<L>Knew ev'ry Shark of Quality;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="18"/>From the grave, cautious few, who live</L>
<L>On thoughtless Youth, and living thrive,</L>
<L>To the light Train who mimic France,</L>
<L>And the soft Sons of Nonchalance.</L>
<L>While Jenny, now no more of use,</L>
<L>Excuse succeeding to excuse,</L>
<L>Grew piqu'd, and prudently withdrew</L>
<L>To shilling Whist, and chicken Lu.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Advanc'd to Fashion's wav'ring head,</L>
<L>They now, where once they follow'd, led.</L>
<L>Devis'd new systems of delight,</L>
<L>A-bed all day, and up all night,</L>
<L>In diff'rent circles reign'd supreme,</L>
<L>Wives copied her, and Husbands him;</L>
<L>Till so <HI>divinely</HI> Life ran on,</L>
<L>So separate, so quite <HI>bon ton,</HI></L>
<L>That meeting in a public place</L>
<L>They scarcely knew each other's face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
<L>At last they met, by <HI>his</HI> desire,</L>
<L><HI>A-tête-à-tête</HI> across the fire;</L>
<L>Look'd in each other's face a-while</L>
<L>With half a tear, and half a smile.</L>
<L>The ruddy health, which wont to grace</L>
<L>With manly glow his rural face,</L>
<L>Now scarce retain'd it's faintest streak;</L>
<L>So sallow was his leathern cheek.</L>
<L>She lank, and pale, and hollow-ey'd,</L>
<L>With <HI>rouge</HI> had striven in vain to hide</L>
<L>What once was beauty, and repair</L>
<L>The rapine of the midnight air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Silence is eloquence, 'tis said.</L>
<L>Both wish'd to speak, both hung the head.</L>
<L>At length it burst.—"'Tis time," he cries,</L>
<L>"When tir'd of folly, to be wise.</L>
<L>"Are you too tir'd?"—then check'd a groan.</L>
<L>She wept consent, and he went on.</L>

<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
<L>"How delicate the married life!</L>
<L>"You love your husband, I my wife.</L>
<L>"Not ev'n satiety could tame,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>"True to the bias of our kind</L>

<L>"'Twas company, 'twas friends to share</L>

<L>"To soothe the sullen hour of spleen;</L>
<L>"Short absences to wake desire,</L>

<LG>
<L>"We left the lonesome place; and found,</L>
