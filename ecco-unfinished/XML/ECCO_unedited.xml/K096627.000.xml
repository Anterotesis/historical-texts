<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>The Instruction of Children having been always thought by wise Men of great Use, both with regard to the pre∣sent Age, and to Posterity; and most of the Books, which have been made use of to introduce Children into an Habit of Reading, being such as tend rather to Cloy than Entertain them: I have thought fit, with short Descrip∣tions of Animals, and Picture fairly draw (which last Experiences shews them to be much delighted with) to engage their Attention. I have there∣fore extracted from some of the most considerable Authors a short Account of Beast, Birds, Fishes, Serpents, and
<PB REF="4"/>Insects: which I hope will prove the more acceptable; there having been nothing done (that I know of) in this Nature, so compendiously for the En∣tertainment of Children. I have for∣born to be very particular in the De∣scription of those Animals, which almost every Child is acquainted with. If this brief Essay shall any ways con∣tribute to the End propos'd, let God have the Glory, and the Compiler the good VVishes and Prayers of Parents.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="book">
<HEAD><HI>BOOK I.</HI> Of Quadrupeds, or Four-footed Beasts.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE LION, justly styled by all Writers the King of Beasts, is gene∣rally of a dun Colour; but not without some Exceptions, as black, white, red, in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and some other Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI> The Hair of some of them is Curl'd and some long, shagged, and thin. His Head is vastly large and strong; his Nose thick; his Mouth very wide; his Eyes are red; fiery, and hollow, not very round, nor long, loo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wry. His fore-feet have five distinct Claws, on ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and the hinder but four; all crooked, sharp and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eding hard. His Sight and Smelling are ve∣ry acute, and he sleeps with his Eyes open. He can't endure Fire. When other wild Beasts hear his terrible roaring Voice, all are surpriz'd with Fear, and dare not stir; though he is not without his Fear of some Creatures, such (as is reported) the great Dogs of <HI>In∣dia,</HI> &amp;c. with which they hunt and kill Lions. He is most commonly taken with Nets, and other Snares. Lions are thought to be long liv'd, because many of them have been found toothless; but this is no certain Sign, as it may proceed from their corrupt Breath, or other Cause.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE LIONESS, the Female of the same Kind, is found in the same Countries, with the same Nature and Properties: but has no Mane at all, which
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>is proper to the Male only, to whose Shoulders and Neck 'tis a great Ornament.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE JACCALL, or <HI>Wild Dog,</HI> (commonly called <HI>the Lion's Provider</HI>) though not much bigger than a Fox; yet is so fierce and bold, that is seizes on such Beasts as Cows, Hogs, Sheep, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and some∣times it will attack a Man. It is reported, that when this Creature seizes his Prey, he makes an hideous Noise, which gives notice to the Lion, who immedi∣ately comes, if within Hearing; at whose Sight the Jaccall goes a little aside, till the Lion has fully satis∣fied his Hunger, and marches off; and then returns, to feed on what the Lion has left. His Head is like a Foxe's, and his Body like a Badger's.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE PANTER is in Shape somewhat like a Lioness, but not quite so large. His Hair is short and mossy, his Skin is of a bright yellow, beautifully mark'd with round black Spots, and is said to send forth a fragrant Smell, and bears a great Price. He is a very fierce and cruel Beast, greedy of Blood, very swift, and catches his Prey by leaping. It is the Na∣ture of this Creature, in some Places, to hide himself amongst the thick Boughs of Trees, and to surprize his Prey. by leaping upon it suddenly. His Tongue in licking grates like a File.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE LEOPARD is both in Shape <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ure and Colour, very much like a Panther, being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ted like that Creature, and is said to be enge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be∣tween a Panther and a Lioness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. THE TIGER is in Shape somewhat like a Lioness, but has a short Neck. His Skin is beauti∣fully spotted, not with round Spots, like a Panther, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with several different Colours. It is very wild and fierce, exceeding ravennous, and of a prodigious Swiftness.

His Skin is so hard, that no Dart is able to pierce it; and cover'd over with Scales like the Shell of a Tortoise. His Legs are also scaled over down to the Hoofs, which are part∣ed into four distinct Claws.

His Mouth is like an Hog's, but longer; being armed with Teeth on both sides, like a Saw. He will not willingly fight with an armed Man; but, when he does, he stands upright, and takes the Man between his fore Feet, and hugs him; but the Man, being covered all over with a kind of Iron Armour, re∣ceives no hurt; and may easily, with a sharp Wea∣pon, pierce through his Heart.

<P N="18">18. THE HORSE is a very fine stately Beast; and one of the most useful Creatures to Man. This Creature is bred now in most Parts of the World. The Horses of <HI>Turkey, Arahia,</HI> and <HI>Persia,</HI> are account∣ed better limb'd and proportion'd than many others; but the <HI>English</HI> Race may justly claim the Precedence of most European Nations; and are not perhaps infe∣rior in Strenth and Beauty to those of any other Country. The Horse is a sagacious and docile Ani∣mal, fierce and couragious in War. It is said, that it was very much owing to Horses, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gain'd such large Acquisitions in <HI>America:</HI> for, when first the Natives saw a Man on horseback, they thought the Man and the Horse to be one individual Creature; which struck them into a very great Terror. The Horse shares a middle Life, scarce attaining to forty, and usual∣ly, not to more than twenty; but this shortness of Life he probably owes to Man: For the Breed of the Sun is now no more, that ranged at large in fresh pasture; yet the Horse continues growing till Six, and generates in old Age. The Mare also goes longer with young than the Woman; and but seldom fouls double. It is wholly superfluous too nicely and particularly to describe the several Parts and Properties of this Creature, which fall almost under every one's Observation.</P>
<P N="19">19. THE ASS is a Beast of Burden, very service∣able to Mankind in carrying a Man, and such Uten∣sils as he pleases to lade him with; of greater Strength than most Animals of his size; but of a stupid and sluggish Nature. The Female is much esteem'd by Phy∣sicians, for its Milk, in Consumptions. This Crea∣ture is usually of a dun Colour, and has the form of a Cross upon its Back and Shoulders. He has nearly the same Age as the Horse, to be more particular, in describing a Creature so well known, is altogether needless.</P>
<P N="20">20. A MULE is a Beast of a mixt Nature, engen∣der'd of a Mare, and an Ass, and resembles an Ass more than an Horse; having long Ears, a Cross upon the Shoulder, small Feet, a lean Body, but in most other respects 'tis like an Horse, it don't propagate at all. The Mule is longer lived than either the Horse, or Ass.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
<P N="21">21. THE FOX is produced in most Countries; nor does one of them differ much in Size from another, but much in Colour. In <HI>Muscovy</HI> some of them are black, some white, and others red. The abode of this Creature in the Day time is in Holes of the Earth; which he never is at the trouble of making; for the Fox, by leaving his Excrements in the Badger's Hole, or Den, thereby takes possession of it for himself, the Badger never caring to come into it any more. The Fox seems well provided for long Life, as being well covered, carnivorous, and living under Ground; yet he is not observed to be long lived. Doubtless he is of the Dog kind, which is but short lived. The Male of this Species will sometimes couple with a Bitch, and the Female with a Dog. When he is hunted, and the Dogs are ready to take him, he is said to urine upon his Tall, and strikes it into the Faces of the Dogs: And as many as he touches with his pist Tail commonly leave off the Chase, unless very good of the kind. But, his Wiles and Strategems being so nume∣rous, I shall forbear to say any more of him or them.</P>

<P N="25">25. THE PORCUPINE grows to the heighth of about two Foot and an half. Its Bite is so sharp, that no wooden Work, as some say, can withstand it. It is so dareing, that it will encounter the most dangerous Snake. When it is provok'd, it shoots its Quills, which are about two Spans long, at Man and Beast. with such violence, that, if they happen to hit on a Board. they will stick in it; which discharge of those Weapons of Artillery, which Nature hath provided for its Defence, if too often repeated, tends to its own De∣struction. Its Flesh, in those Countries where it breeds, is esteemed by the Natives as good Food.</P>
<P N="26">26. THE BADGER is of two Kinds; one sort like a Dog, the other like a Swine: It differs likewise in the shape of the Snout, one resembling a Dog's, the other an Hog's; the former of which cats Flesh and Carrion, like a Dog; the latter Fruit and Roots, like a Swine. 'Tis about as big as a Fox, but of a shorter and thicker Body. His Skin is hard and rugged; his Hair harsh and stubborn: His Back is broad: his Legs are longer on the right Side than the left. His Teeth are prodigious sharp; and, when he fights with a Dog, he useth both his Teeth and Nails, which are also very sharp</P>

He has two Hole<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under his 'Tail to dis∣charge his Excrements; which no Creature living has besides. His common Food is Apples, Worms, or Grapes, It is reported, that when he finds Apples on the Ground, under the Trees, he rolls himself upon them, untill he has fill'd all his Prickles and then carries them to his Den; never having above one in his Mouth. When it is apprehensive of Danger it draws it self up as round as a Football; so that nothing ap∣pears but the Prickles.</P>

When it is very hungry, it enters the Graves of Men, and eats their dead Bodies; yet is its Flesh, in <HI>Syria, Damasous,</HI> &amp; eaten by Men. Its Feet and Legs are like a Man's; its Colour like a Bear's; and is thought to be engender'd of a Bear and a Dog. it is a Beast of great Sultilty, that barks, and makes an hideous Noise in the Night.

It is tamed, and put into a Coach, Chariot, or S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edge, to draw Men thro' great Snows, and upon the Ice. It is said to be more swift, and to run more Miles in one Day, than an Horse can in two.

The Female has likewise Horns. His Neck is short, but thick; his Ears and Back very long. It's Colour is generally like an Hart's, but sometimes all white. Its Horns weighs twelve or fourteen Pounds. There is great Virtue ascribed to its Hoof in Medicine.</P>

His fore Feet are arm'd with very strong Nails. He is very swift, and hard to be taken.

<P N="43">43. THE LYNX, by some esteem'd the sme Creature with the <HI>Ounce,</HI> has from others met with this following Description: It is about as big as a Lamb of two or three Years old. His Head, Mouth, Feet, and Nails, are like a Cat's. His Beard hangs down on both sides, divided in the middle, being of sundry Colours. His Tail is shore and thick: His Ears are erected upright, as the Ears of a Cat. His Colour, in the outermost Parts, is red, in the innermost white, sprinkled with black Spot; and on both sides his Nose there are four Spots set in order. In the upper Lip, on both sides, are white Hairs, rougher than those in a Cat. or Lion. He is a quick moving Creature, and hardly ever known to stand still. His Skin is esteem'd and used, by Nobles. He is loving and gentle to his Keeper and not cruel to any Man.</P>
<P N="44">44. THE CHAMELEON is very rare to be seen. It is firmly asserted by some Naturalists, that it lives on Air. Tho others have asserted from their own Experience as they assure us, that upon the Dissec∣tion of this Animal, Flies have been found in its Belly: From whence it seems reasonable to conclude, that, however it may live some time by sucking in the Air, yet that is not its only Nourishment. It is said frequently to change its Colour, very often three or four times in half an hour: Which commonly is grey. The Colour it mostly changes to is very fine green, spotted with yellow. Its Skin is very thin, and almost transparent. Its Tongue is as long as its whole Body. It is said to be so timorous, that, when, it descends from any Heighth, it moves very cautious∣ly, and curls its Tail, by which it can hold fast about something or other in its way, lest it should slip. This Creature is like a Lizard.</P>

It is commonly branded, or sandy on the Back. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> having a back Streak down the Back. Its Tail is about as long as a Calf's. Its Belly and Sides are spotted with white, which Spots it loses in old Age. Its Flesh is good for Nourish∣ment, but its Blood, when eaten, occasions Melan∣choly.

This Creature is bred in very many Countries; but the <HI>British</HI> seems to have the Preserene of most. The H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nde, the Female of this Creature, has no Horns.

He is a great Enemy to all kinds of Serpents, which he la∣bours to destroy, wherever he finds any: But is afraid of almost all other Creature. His Flesh is account∣ed excellent Food; and, as well as his Horns, is esteemed good in Physick. Little need be said of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leasure taken in hunting this Creature and the Roe Buck, it being a Matter so well known.</P>
<P>THE STAG is vulgarly famed for long Life; but upon no certain History. There goes a report of a certain Stag found with a Chain about his Neck, buri∣ed in Fat. That he should be a long lived Creature seems less probable, because he comes to his full growth at five; soon after which his Horns, which are yearly shed and renewed, grow from a narrower Basis, and less Branching.—</P>

There is an Herb, which has a Seed like a Myrtle Seed, that is poisonous to Worms, yet is Food for Camels. It will not drink clear or clean Water, but that which is slimy, or muddy. It will endure Thir't for some Days; for which reason it is more useful for Travellers than Horses, in the <HI>Lybyan</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Deserts: When it drinks, it takes in a very large Quantity.

This Creature was formerly used to draw a Chariot, and presented to Princes; and in the Time of War every one carry'd two Archers, who sat upon him back to back, shooting their Darts, one against the Frout of the Enemy, and the other against the Followers. it is said to travel an hundred Miles in a Day, and to carry a Burden of Fifteen hundred Weight; bending his Knee, like the Camel, to take up his Load and Rider.</P>

When it crosses a River, the Dam takes her Young up with her Snout, with which she grasps it, and carries it safe over. The Female is more strong and couragious than the Male, and will bear a greater Burden; but in war the Male is more graceful, because taller. When it is most loaded, it will go swift; and can carry a wooden Tower upon its Back, and thirty Men, with their Ammunitions and Provisions of War. It is one of the most docile of all Animals, and may be taught to do many Tricks. If it receives no hurt, it will live an hundred Years; and sometimes two hundred: the Blood of the Ele∣phant is observed to be the coldest of all Animals.</P>

The feet are yellow; the Toes above toward the Leg, covered with Scales; toward the Talons, with round Tables.</P>
<P>THE <HI>VULTURINE EAGLE,</HI> called <HI>Gy∣paetos,</HI> is of a very large size, being not much less than the Golden Eagle, but of an unusual and ridi∣culous shape; the Beak, not as in other Eagles, bend∣ing from the root to the tip, but straight almost to the middle, toward the Point bowed into a remarkable Hook, after the same manner as in Vultures.

<P N="10">10. <HI>THE</HI> MOOR BUZZARD is lesser than the common Buzzard, of about the bigness of a Crow, The Crown of the Head is of a kind of clay Colour; the whole Body, as well lower as upper side, is of a dark rusty colour; only at the middle Joint of both Wings there is a Spot of the same reddish clay colour with the Head; and the Feathers at the Root or rise of the Tail are dun. The Tail is about nine Inches long, being parti-coloured, of a dark and light yellow or bay; the Legs are about an Hand-breadth long, feather'd down a little balow the Knee, longer, and slenderer, for the bigness of the Bird, than in others of this Kind; the Legs and Feet yellow; the Talons black.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>THE</HI> GOSHAWK is bigger than the com∣mon Buzzard. The colour of the Head, Neck, Back, and upper side of the Wings are of a dark brown. The whole Breast and Belly white, with transverse black Lines standing very thick; the Thighs are covered over with reddish Feathers, having a black Line in the middle down the Shaft; the Legs and Feet are yellow; the Talons black; the Beak blue. The Wings, when closed, fall much short of the End of the Train; by which Note alone, and its bigness, it is sufficiently distinguished from all other Hawks; the Train is long, of a dun colour, with four or five cross blackish Bars, standing at a great distance from each o∣ther. It takes not only Partridge and Pheasant, but also greater Fowl, as Geese and Crane; sometimes also it catches Rabbets.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>THE</HI> SPARROW-HAWK is about as big as a large Wood Pidgeon. Its Beak is short, hooked, blue, and black toward the tip; the Tongue thick, black, and a little cleft; the Eyes of a mean size; the Crown of the Head is of a dark brown: Above the Eyes, and in the hinder part of the Head some∣times, are white Feathers. The bottoms of the Fea∣thers
<PB N="79" REF="84"/>in Head and Neck are white. The rest of the upper side, Back, Shoulders, Wings, and Neck, are of the same dark brown, except some feathers of the Wings, which are spotted with white. The colour of the under side, <HI>viz.</HI> the Neck, Breast, Belly, Sides and Wings, is various, of white and blackish, or russet. The Wings, when closed, scarce reach to the middle of the Tail; the Thighs are strong and fleshy, as in all Birds of Prey; the Legs long, slender, and yellow; the Toes also long; the talons black. It lays about five white Eggs, spotted near the blunt end with a Circle of blood-red Specks. It feeds only upon Birds; and for its bigness it is a very bold and couragious Bird.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>THE</HI> KITE, or <HI>Glead,</HI> is bigger than the common Buzzard. The Head and Chin are of a pale ash-colour, varied with black Lines along the Shafts of the Feathers; the Neck is red, the middle part of the Feathers being black; the Back dusky or brown, like a Buzzard; the feathers next the Tail are of the same Colour with it, having their middle Parts, or Shafts, black. The lesser Rows of Wing-feathers are parti-colour'd of red, black, and white; the feathers covering the inside of the Wing are red, with black Spots in their middles; the Tail is forked, the Colour red, the extreme feathers blackish, and the tips of all are white; the Bill is black; the Tongue broad and thick; the Eyes are great; the Legs and Feet yellow; the Talons black. By the figure of its Tail alone it is distinguished from all other Birds of Prey. Her tail serves her for a Rudder, to direct her flight through the Air, whence some learned Men have thought, that Men at first learn'd the Art of fleering a Ship from this Bird. It is a very hold Bird, and a great Destroyer of young Poultry. It is said, that, when it sees a young Duck, Chicken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> far from Shelter, or by any other means lying sit and exposed to Rapine, it singles it out, and flies round and round for a while, marking it; then of a sudden it darts down as swift as Lightning; and catches it up before it is aware.</P>

The throat, as far as the Breast-bone, is somewhat whitish, besprink∣led with great Spots; the rest of the Breast is beau∣tified with certain Marks, which are sometimes of the Colour of rusty Iron, sometimes red, and some∣times blackish: besides these, it has other smaller Specks; the Back and Loins are covered with small brown feathers. It is faid to prey only upon great Birds, neglecting the smaller. It is very ravenous, and of an indocile Nature.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> Red <HI>INDIAN FALCON</HI> is about the bigness of the Mountain Falcon. The Head is of an ash Colour, tending to brown; as is also the Neck, the whole Back, and the outside of the Wings: the whole Breast, and also the upper part of the inside of the Wings, the Belly and the Rump, the Hips and Thighs, are all fulvous, or red, of a pale Vermilion Colour; but the Chin in this red Colour is marked with a long ash-colour Spot, produced downwards. The Breast also before is besprinkled with small Specks of the same Colour: the Legs and Feet are yellow, pretty thick and strong; the talons black, and very sharp.</P>
<P N="16"><HI>THE</HI> Greater BUTCHER-BIRD, or <HI>Matta∣gess,</HI> in the North of <HI>England</HI> is called <HI>Werkengel;</HI> in some Parts of <HI>Germany</HI> it is called by a Name, which in our Language signifies <HI>Ninekiller,</HI> because it is said to kill nine <HI>Birds</HI> before it ceases, or every Day nine. It is for bigness equal to the common <HI>Black∣bird:</HI> the Head, Back, and Rump, are ash-colour'd; the Chin and belly white; the breast and lower part of the throat varied with dark Lines, crossing each other; the tips of the feathers on the Wings are for the most part white; the outmost feathers of the tail are all over white, the two middlemost have on∣ly their tips white, the rest of the feather being black; the legs and feet are black. It is said to
<PB N="83" REF="88"/>build among thorny Shrubs, dwarf trees, and bushes; making its Nest of Moss, Wooll, and certain downy Herbs; but the bottoms thereof of Heath, upon which it lays withinside the soft and tender Stalks of Hay; and most commonly lays six Eggs. It feeds com∣monly on Infects; yet doth it often kill small Birds.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>THE lesser BUTCHER-BIRD,</HI> call'd in <HI>Yorkshire, Flusher,</HI> is about the bigness of a Lark, and hath a great Head. About the Nostrils and Corners of the Mouth grow black Hairs, or Bristles. The back and upper side of the Wing, are of a rusty Co∣lour; the Head and Rump of an Ash; the lower Belly is white; the throat and breast white, dashed whith red. It builds its Nest of Grass bents, and fea∣thers; and lays six Eggs, towards the sharper end al∣most wholly white, toward the blunter encompassed with a Circle of brown or dark red.</P>
<P N="18">18. <HI>THE</HI> CUCKOW is about the bigness of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lagpie; its length, from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail being about twelve Inches, the upper Chap of the Bill somewhat hooked, and longer than the lower, for the most part of a dark or blackish Co∣lour; the nether of a pale or whitish Yellow. The inside of the Mouth and the Tongue are of a deep yellow or saffron Colour. The throat; breast, and belly are white. The Feathers of the Head are of a dark brown, with white Edges. The Neck and Back are brown, with a tincture of red. The Rump is ash∣colour'd: the covert feathers of the Wings are of the same Colour with those on the Back, only the out∣most darker. Its feet and Claws are yellow. It hath two back toes. It feeds on Caterpillars and other Insects. The Cuckow herself builds no Nest; but, having found the Nest of some little Bird, she either devours or destroys the Eggs she there finds, and in the room lays one of her own, and so forsakes it. The silly <HI>Bird</HI> returning, sits on this Egg, hatches it, and with a great deal of Care and toil broods, feeds, and cherishes the young Cuckow for her own, until it be grown up, and ready to fly, and shift for itself.

<P N="19">19. <HI>THE</HI> HORN OWL is in length, from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, about fourteen Inches; its breadth, measuring from tip to tip of the Wings-extended, three foot and four Inches; the feathers which cover the lower belly and legs are red∣dish; in the throat and breast the middle Parts of the feathers are black, the outer Parts partly white, and partly yellow; those under the Wings are red; the covert feathers of the Wings are parti-coloured; of a dark ash and yellow; the back of the same Colour with the Wings; the Horns are above an Inch long, consisting of six feathers. The legs and feet are fea∣ther'd down to the very Claws, which are black.</P>
<P N="20">20. <HI>THE</HI> Common <HI>BARN OWL,</HI> or <HI>White Owl,</HI> is about the bigness of a Pidgeon. Its bill is white, hooked at the end, more than an Inch and half long. This Bird has a Circle or Wreath of white, soft, downy feather, encompassed with yel∣low ones, beginning from the Nostrils on each side, passing round the Eyes, and under the Chin, some∣what resembling a black Hood, such as Women use to wear; So that the Eyes appear to be sunk in the middle of these feathers. The breast, belly, and co∣vert feathers of the inside of the Wings are white, marked with a few dark Spots. The Head, Neck, and back, as far as the prime feathers of the wings, variously, and of all Night-birds the most elegantly colour'd. The Legs are covered with a thick Down to the feet, but the Toes are only hairy, the Hairs al∣so thin set.</P>
<P N="21">21. <HI>THE</HI> GREY OWL is bigger than the com∣mon Barn Owl. The head, back, wings, and tail, are of an ash-Colour, speckled with whitish and black Spots. Under the belly the feathers are white, with blackish Spots. The Head is very great, thick, round, and full of feathers. In other respects it is like the Common Owl.</P>
<PB N="87" REF="92"/>
<P N="22">22. <HI>THE</HI> FERN OWL, or <HI>Churn Owl,</HI> or <HI>Goal-sucker,</HI> is a very beautiful Bird for Colour, being more like a Cuckow than an Owl; and it is easily distinguished from all other Birds, by the Structure of its Bill and feet. Its Bill in Proportion to its Body, is the least of all Birds, and a little crooked. It hath a huge wide Mouth and Swallow. On the sides of the upper Chap of the Bill, as also under the Chin, it has stiff black Hairs, like bristles. The un∣der side of the Body is painted with black and pale red Lines; the hinder part of the Head of an ash Colour. The Wings are parti-colour'd of black and red. The Legs are very small in proportion, feather'd on the foreside half-way. It is found in the moun∣tainous Woods in many Places of <HI>England,</HI> as in <HI>York∣shire, Derbyshire,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="23">23. <HI>THE</HI> PARROT hath a great Head, an hard beak and Scull. This Bird, in descending, or climb∣ing up boughs, grates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> first catches hold with her bill, as it were with an Hook, then draws up her Bo∣dy, then fastens her feet; then reaching up higher, claps on her beak again, and so puts forward her bo∣dy and feet by turns. The Parrot only, with the Crocodile, moves the upper Jaw, as all other Animals do the lower. The Tongue is broad, and resembles a Man's. The feet are of a singular fashion, for they have not three Toes standing forward, and one back∣ward, but two each way, like Woodpecker's. It does not only imitate Man's Voice, but in Wit excells all other Birds. It is said, that a Parrot which fell out of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth's Palace at <HI>Westminster,</HI> in∣to the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> that runs by, and then, very seasonably remembring the Words it had often heard somewhere in Danger, or in Jest, used, cry'd out amain, <HI>A Boat, a Boat, for twenty Pound.</HI> A certain experienc'd <HI>Boatman</HI> made thither presently, took up the <HI>Bird,</HI> and restored it to the King, to whom he knew it belonged; hoping for as great Reward as the <HI>Bird</HI> had promised.

There are several sorts of Parrots differing both in Size and Colour.

<P N="24">24. The RAVEN is a very large <HI>Fowl,</HI> being in length, from the tip of the Bill to the end of the tail, about two foot. The <HI>Bill</HI> is long, thick, sharp, and very black; the upper Chap somewhat hooked, but not so as in Hawks, the lower streight; the fea∣thers are black all over the body, having a blue Splen∣dour or Gloss; which is seen especially in the tail and Wings. The belly is something paler, in∣clining <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brown. It hath large crooked Claws. The Raven feeds not only upon <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>Insects,</HI> but al∣so upon the Carcasses of <HI>Beasts, Birds,</HI> and <HI>Fishes;</HI> moroever, it sets upon, kills, and devours living <HI>Birds,</HI> after the manner of Hawks. Ravens abound in all Countries, they bring hardy <HI>Birds,</HI> that will easily bear all Changes of Weather, fearing neither Heat nor Cold. The Raven lays about five or six Eggs before it begins to sit, of a pale greenish blue, full of black Spots, This <HI>Bird</HI> is said to live to a very great Age, forty or fifty Years, or upwards.</P>
<P N="25">25. <HI>THE</HI> Common or CARRION CROW is lesser than the Raven, being about eighteen Inches in length. The Bill is strong, thick, and streight, The Colour of the whole Body is black, only the ground or bottom of the Feathers of a lead, or dirk ash Colour. This Bird delights to feed upon Carrion, that is, Carcasses of dead Animals when they begin to putrefy. It likewise kills and devours living Birds, in like manner as the Raven; moreover it eats Grain and all sorts of Insects, in <HI>England</HI> at least. For be∣yond Seas (they say) it meddles with no sort of Grain. It builds upon high Trees, and lays four or five Eggs at a time, like the Raven, but less. The Crow is said to have a very sagacious Scent, so that it is difficult to shoot it, the Bird smelling the Gunpowder far off.</P>
<PB N="91" REF="96"/>
<P N="26">26. <HI>THE</HI> ROOK is something bigger than the Crow. It hath no Craw, but, instead thereof, the Gullet below the Bill is dilated into kind of Bag, wherein it brings Meat to seed its Young. Its Co∣lour i black, but brighter than that of the Crow. The Rooks build many together, upon high Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> about Gentlemen's Houses, who are much delighted with the Noise they make in Breeding-time: Both Cock and Hen sit by turns. Their Eggs are like <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word Crow's, but lesser, spotted with greater Spots. I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is said, that when Roooks build, one of the Pair al∣ways sit to watch the Nest, till it be finished, whilst the other goes about to fetch Materials: Else, if both go, and leave the Nest unfinished, as sometimes they venture to do, their Follow-Rooks, e'er they return again, will have robb'd them, and carried away to their several Nests all their Sticks, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ver else they had got together. Hence, perhaps, the Word <HI>Rooking</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> used for cheating or abousing. Young Rooks are good Food.</P>
<P N="27">27. <HI>THE</HI> JACKDAW is much lesser than a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Crow. It h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a large Head, and a strong Bill. The hinder Part of the Head, as far as the middle of the Neck, inclines to an ash Colour, as also the breast and belly, but less, else the whole Plumage is black, with a kind of blue Gloss; the fore-Part of the Head is of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deeper black. It seeds upon Nuts, Fruits, Seeds, and Insects. Jackdaws usually frequent and build in ancient Castles, Towers, Cliffs, Houses, and Stone-Walls, especially if they be desolate and ruin∣ous. They lay five or six Eggs, lesser, paler, and having sewer Spots than those of Crows. The Jack∣daw, being a very subtil and cunning Bird, may be taught to imitate human Voice like a Magpie.</P>
<P N="28">28 <HI>THE MAGPIE</HI> is about the bigness of the Jackdaw; and, excepting the whiteness of the Breast, and Wings, and the length of the tail, it is very much like that Bird. The Head, Neck, Throat, Back, Rump, and lower Belly, are of a black colour. The breast and Sides are white, as also the first Joint of the Wing. The Wings are smaller than the bigness of the body would seem to require. It is a very crafty and cunning

It is a pretty Sight to see her fetch a Nut out of her Hoard, place it fast in a Chink, and then standing a∣bove it, with its Head-downwards, striking it with all its Force, breaks the Shell, and catches up the Kernel.</P>

<P N="36">36. <HI>THE</HI> HOOPOE is in length, from the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail, about twelve Inches. Its Bill is two Inches and an half long, black, sharp, and something bending. The Head is adorn∣ed with a most beautiful Crest, two Inches high, consisting of a double Row of Feathers, reaching from the Bill to the Nape of the Neck, all along the top of the Head: which it can at pleasure set up, or let fall. The Neck is of a pale red: the Breast white, with black Strokes tending downwards. The Rump is white, the Wings and Back are varied with white and black cross Lines or Bars.</P>
<P N="27">37. <HI>THE</HI> KINGFISHER is something bigger than a Sparrow. The Chin is white with a certain mizture of red; the middle also of the Breast or Belly is of the like Colour. The lower Belly under the Tail is of a deep red, as are also the Sides and Fea∣thers under the Wings. The Breast is red, the out∣most Borders of the Feathers being of a dirty bluish green. From the Necl, through the middle of the Back to the Tail, it is of a most lovely bright, but pale blue, which by its splendour is said to hurt their Eyes that look long and intently upon it.</P>
<P N="38">38. <HI>THE</HI> BEE-EATER is as big as a Black∣bird. The Crown of the Head is red, but in some Birds having something of green mixt. The Neck and Shoulders are green, with a certain mixture of red. The whole Belly and Breast, as far as the Chin, are blue; this Colour is deepr near the Chin, fainter on the Breast and Belly. It is said, that it feeds chiefly on Bees; flying in the Air it catches and preys upon them, as Swallows do upon Flies.</P>
<P N="39">39. <HI>THE</HI> WATER-OUZEL, or <HI>Water-Crake,</HI> is nigh as big as the common Blackbird. The Head, and upper side of the Neck, are of a dark, dusky Colour, or black, with an Eye of red, all the Back

<P N="40">40. <HI>THE</HI> OSTRICH is the greatest of all Birds. When it holds up its Head, it approacheth to the heighth of two Yards. The Head is small, En∣crown'd like a Goose's. The Head and Neck, al∣most as far as the Breast, are bare of Feathers, as are also the Things. The Head and Neck are cover'd with a certain Down, or thin set Hairs, instead of Feathers, The Sides under the Wings, and the Things., are absolutely bare. The lower Part of the Neck, where the Feathers begin, is white. The Wings are small, and altogether unuseful for flying designed by Nature only to assist the Bird in running. The Feathers on the Back in the Cook are colo-black, in the Hen only duskey; so soft, that they resemble a kind of Wool.<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The Wing-Feathers are of the same Colour beneath, but above in their upper Part pure∣ly white.

His Head, Neck, and beginning of the Breast, are of a deep blue. It hath a Tust on the top its Head, not entire, as in some other Birds, but consisting of a kind of naked, but very tender, green Stalk; or Shafts of Feathers, bearing on their tops, as it were, Lily-flowers of the same Colour, The Neck is long, and for the bigness of the Fowl very slender The Back is of a pale ash-Colour, besprinkled with many black Spots: The Rump is of a deep green. The long Feathers of the Tail are all of a chesnut Colour, beautified with most elegant gold Lines, tending upwards, but ending in tips of a very deep green; and those forked, like Swallows Tails. The circular Spots, or the Eyes of the Feathers, are particolour'd of a deep green, shin∣ing like a cry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olite, a gold, and sapphire Colour: For those Eyes consist of four Circles of different Co∣burs; the first a golden, the second a ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>snut, the third a green, the fourth or middle place, is taken up by a blue or sapphire.colour'd Spot, almost of the figure and bigness of a Kidney-Bean. The Hips, legs, and Feet are of an ash Colour, with black Spots. The Belly, near the Stomach, is of a bluish green. Its Food is the same with that of the Com∣mon

The Flesh of this Fowl resem∣bles much in taste that of a Turkey, only rather courser: Though dressed never so throughly, yet when cold appears as if perfectly raw: and has been proved by Experience (as we have it from good Au∣thority) that, when dressed will keep a great while, even some Months without Putrefaction.</P>
<P N="43">43. <HI>THE</HI> TURKEY is as tall as a Peacock, Its Neck, together with its Head, is altogether bare of Feathers and only covered with a purplish colour'd Skin. The Feathers of this Bird do somewhat resem∣ble an Hawk's, and have their ends white.

<P N="44">44. <HI>THE</HI> Common COCK being so well known, it will be but lost Labour to bestow many Words about it. It is a very couragious and high-spirited Bird, that, if of a good Breed, will rather die than yeild: and being a most lecherous Bird, doth sud∣denly grow old: and seldom liveth above ten Years It hath been delivered and received by Antients and Moderns, with un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>imous Consent and Approbation, that the Lion is afraid of a Cock, cannot endure the Sight of him, yea is terrified by his very Crowing; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>od<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vers Reasons sought and assigned for this Anti∣pathy; when as the thing it self is by Experience found to be false.</P>

The Legs are armed with Spurs, shorter than in a Cock, but sharp, and of a black Co∣lour. The Hen is nothing so beautiful as the Cock, almost of the Colour of a Quail. It lives in the Woods; and feeds upon Acrons, Berries, Grain, and Seeds of Plants. The Pheasant is accounted better Meat than almost all other Fowls, as well because it is rare, as because it is of a most delicate Taste, and yeilds so excellent a Nourishment.</P>

The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain and sides of the Head, are of a deep yellow or saffron Colour. The Cock hath on his Breast a red Mark, of a semicir∣cular figure, resembling an Horseshoe. The Hen hath not so much red on her Breast, Below the Chin, as far as the Horseshoe Mark, it is of a bluish ash Colour, adorned with black Lines running across. The upper side of the Body is particoutour'd, of red, ash, and black. It seeds upon Ants, Ants Eggs, the Grains of Corn and also upon green Leaves. It lay∣eth sixteen or eighteen Eggs, ere it sits, In Winter time Partridges fly in company, For they are of that Nature that they breed and bring up fifteen or six∣teen together, which company all Winter with the Old ones: but in the Spring time, when they pair together, they fly by two and two; for then the Old ones beat away the Young from them.</P>
<P N="47">47. <HI>THE</HI> QUAIL is the least Bird in this Kind being in length about seven Inches. The Colour of the Breast and Belly, are of a dirty pale yellow. the Throat hath a little mixture of red, The Head is black, only the Edges of the Feathers reddish. The middle part of each covert Feather of the Back, and lower part of the Neck, is marked with a yellowish white Storke. The Wings are of a daskey Colour, crossed with pale red Lines. The Tail is not above an such and half long. Pheasants, Patridges, Quails,

<P N="48">48. <HI>THE</HI> TURTLE DOVE is something less than a common Pigeon. Its Head and the middle of its back are blue, or ash Colour: The Shoulders and the Rump are of a sordid red; The Breast and Belly white: The Throat tinctured with a lovely vinace∣ous Colour.

<P N="51">51. <HI>THE</HI> MISSEL-BIRD, or <HI>Shrite,</HI> is some∣what bigger than a blackbird. The Head is of a lead Colour; The Back, Tail, and Rump, have some mixture of yellow. The under side of the Body, from the Bill to the Tail, is speckled with pretty great blackish Spots. The upper part of the Breast, the Sides. and Feathers under the Tail, are yellow; the middle of the Belly white. Sitting upon the tops of high Trees, as Oaks, Elms, <HI>&amp;c.,</HI> in the Spring, it sings rarely well. It abides the Year round with us in <HI>England;</HI> and breeds here. It is a solitary Bird, accompanying and flying only with its Mate.</P>
<P N="52">52. <HI>THE</HI> SONG-THRUSH, in the Colour and Spots of the Breast and Belly, agrees with the Missel-bird: for the Spots are duskey; the Breast yellowish; the Belly white. The upper surface of the Body is all over duskey, with a mixture of yellow in the Wings. The Cock cannot be known from the Hen by its Co∣lour. It abides all the Year, and breeds with us in <HI>England</HI> It builds its Nest outwardly of Earth, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>loss, and Straws, and within daubs it with Clay: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ying its Eggs and Young upon the bare Clay, It <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ys at one sitting five or six Eggs of a bluish green

<P N="53">53. <HI>THE</HI> Common BLACKBIRD is little or nothing less than a Fieldfare. The Cock whistles and sings very pleasantly all the Spring and Summer time. The Blackbird builds her Nest very artificial∣ly, withoutside of Moss, slender Twigs, Bents, cement∣ed or joined together with Clay; daubing it also all over withinside with Clay, and covering the Clay with small Straws, Bents, Hair, or other soft Matter, upon which she lays her Eggs, She lays four or five Eggs, of a bluish green Colour spotted.</P>
<P N="54">54, <HI>THE</HI> REDWING is rather less than the Thrush, The upper side of the Body is of the same Colour with that of the Thrush: the Breast not so much spotted, The covert Feathers of the under side of the Wings, and of the sides of the Body under the Wings, which in the Thrush are yellow, in this Kind are of a red orange Colour; by which Mark it is chiefly distinguished from it. The Belly is white: The Throat and Breast yellowish, spotted with dusky Spots. It comes to us from beyond Seas, as the Field∣fare, with which it flies in company, observing the same times of coming and returning.</P>
<P N="55">55. <HI>THE</HI> FIELDFARE is somewhat bigger than a Blackbird. The Head, Neck, and Rump, are ash colour'd in some of a deep blue.

<P N="59">59. <HI>THE</HI> MARTIN, or <HI>Martinet,</HI> or <HI>Martlet,</HI> is somewhat less than the Common Swallow. Its Feet to the very Claws, are covered with a white Down; by which Note it is easily distinguishable from all its Fellows of the Swallow Kind, Its Head,

It is a very tame and inno∣cent Bird; it builds its Nest of Mud, with a great deal of Art, under the Eaves of Houses, Windows, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> and feeds upon flies and other Insects.</P>
<P N="60">60. <HI>THE</HI> Common HOUSE-SWALLOW is on the Head, Neck, Back, and Rump, of a very lovely shining, purplish blue Colour. The Throat is of the same Colour with the Neck: The Breast and Belly are white, with a dash of red. The Tail is forked, cosisting of twelve Frathers; the utmost of which are an Inch longer than the next, and end in sharp Points. The Wings are of the same Colour with the Back. Swallows build in Chimneys; and feed upon flies, Worms, and other Insects. What becomes of Swallows, Martins, and some other <HI>Bird,</HI> in Winter time; whether they fly into other Coun∣tries, or sleep in hollow Trees, and the like Places; natural Historians are not agreed, nor indeed can they certainly determine.

<P N="62">62. <HI>THE ROBIN-RED-BREAST</HI> is a <HI>Brid</HI> well known in almost all Countries, that but little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed to be said of it. In Winter time, to seek Food, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t enters into Houses with much Confidence; being a very hold <HI>Bird,</HI> sociable, and familiar with Man. In the Summer time, when there is plenty of Food in the Woods, it withdraws it self in the most desert Places. It is a solitary <HI>Bird;</HI> and feeds singly: whence the Proverb took its rise, <HI>Unum arbustum <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> alit duous Erithacos;</HI> One Shrub doth not produce <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no Robin-red-breasts. It feeds upon Insects, Ants Eggs, Crumbs of bread, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For a Song-bird it is by some esteemed little inferior to the Nightingale. The Male may be known and distinguished from the Female by the Colour of his Legs, which are blacker, and by certain Hairs which grow on each side his <HI>Bill</HI> and his breast being of a deeper red.</P>
<P N="63">63, LARKS are distinguished from other sorts of Birds; 1. By their long Heel or Claw of the back Toe; which is the characteristick Mark of these Birds. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the earthly Colour of their Feathers 3. By their singing as they fly, mounting up in the Air. The Common Sky-Lark is not much bigger than an House Sparrow, yet longer bodied. It builds its Nest sometimes in plain open Ground, under some clod of Earth; and sometimes is Corn, or thick high Grass: and though in Winter we see great Plocks of them, yet we find the sewest of their Nests of any Birds that are so plentiful. It breeds thrice in a Year, in <HI>May, July,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> rearing her Young very suddenly: so that, if you have a Nest, you must take them as soon as they are spoon-feather∣ed, or else you run the risque of losing them, for they will get them gone of a sudden. Young Nestlings may be brought up almost with any Meat; but if you give them Sheep's Heart and Egg chopt together, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tili they are about three Weeks old, it will not be a∣miss: and when they come to eat alone, give them O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tmeal, Hempseeds and Bread mixed together with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le Egg.</P>
<PB N="119" REF="124"/>
<P N="64">64. <HI>THE</HI> WOOLDLARK is distinguished from the Common Lark by the following Marks; 1. Whist∣ling like a Blackbird. 2. A Cricle of white Feathers encompassing the Head, from Eye to Eye, like a Crown or Wreath. 3. The first or outmost Feather of the Wing being much shorter than the second; whereas in the Common Lark it is near equal. 4. The outmost Feathers of the Tail having white tips. 5. That it sits upon Trees. 6. It is lesser than the Common Lark, but hath a shorter, thicker, or round∣er Body, for its bigness. The Woodlark is campa∣rable to the Nightingale for singing, and by some preferred before it. It is a very tender Bird, and yet breeds the soonest of any in <HI>England.</HI> It builds most commonly in Lays, where the Grass hath been pretty rank, and is grown russet, under some large Turf. to shelter its Nest from the Wind and Wea∣ther.</P>
<P N="65">65. <HI>THE</HI> CREASTED LARK differs from the Common Lark; 1. In bigness. 2. In the Crest. 3. In the Colour of the Back, which is less spotted, and not so beautiful. 4. In the measure of the Tail, which in this Bird is shorter, 5. In that it soars not so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much in the Air; and when it mounts up, stays not so long there. 6. That it flies not in Flocks, as they do. Lastly, It is frequently seen about the Banks of Lakes and Rivers.</P>
<P N="66">66. <HI>THE</HI> NIGHTINGALE, being the Chief of all singing Birds, is about the bigness of a Gold<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> finch, or Redstart, and long bodied. Its Colour o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the upper Part, <HI>viz.</HI> Head, and Back, are fo a dee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gold Colour. with a certain mixture of green, like that of a Redwing.

The Parts under the Wings, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Breast, and Throat, are of a darker Colour, with the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cture of green. This Bird is not remarkable for any variety or beauty of Colours, but well know from its singing by Night. The Nightingale is very impatient of Cold, and therefore in Winter time either hides itself in some lurking Place, or fli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> away into hot Countries.

<P N="67">67. <HI>THE</HI> VIRGINIA NIGHTINGALE is nigh as big as a Blackbird. It hath a Tuft on its Head of a scarlet Colour; with which Colour also the Neck, Breast, and Belly, are adorned. The ends of the Wings are not of so deep a scarlet, as neither the Tail. The Colour of the whole is a lovely scarlet, only the Head and Tail more faint. Seeing its Image in a Glass it hath many strange Gesticulations making an hissing Noise, lowring its Crest, setting up its Tail after the manner of the Peacock, shaking its Wings; in fine, striking at the Looking glass with its Bill.</P>
<P N="68">68. <HI>THE</HI> BLACK CAP is a very small Bird, not weighing above half an Ounce. The top of the Head is black; whence it took its Name: the Neck of an ash Colour. the whole Back of a dark green, the Wings of a dusky Colour, only that their Edges are a little green. The Tail is also of a dusky Colour, with a little Tincture of green. The nether part of the Neck, the Throat and upper part of the Breast, are of a pale ash Colour: the lower Belly white, tinc∣tured with yellow. This Bird is common in <HI>Italy;</HI> it is also found in <HI>England,</HI> but more rarely.</P>
<P N="69">69. <HI>THE</HI> HUMMING BIRD is the least of all Birds. The Head, together with the Feathers is of the bigness of a mean-sized sweet Cherry: the Neck is three quarters of an Inch long: the Body an Inch and a quarter. The Body, together with the Feathers, is scarce equal in bigness to a <HI>Spanish</HI> Olive, Its Colour is wonderfully resplendent; so that it can∣not be well represented by any Painter: for with a green, such as is seen in the Necks of Peacocks, a gol∣den, flame colour, and yellow, are strangely mixt; so that being exposed to the Sun-beams it shines ad∣mirably. It makes its Nest in the Boughs of Trees, of the bigness of an <HI>Holland</HI> Schilling; and lays very white Eggs, two for the most part, of an oval figure, not bigger than Pease. It is fed and nourished with
<PB N="123" REF="128"/>Honey Dew, and the Juice of Flowers, which it sucks out of them with its Bill. It flies very swift, and makes a humming Noise like a Hornet, or Bee: hence it took its Name in <HI>English</HI> of Humming Bird.</P>
<P N="70">70, <HI>THE</HI> WREN is a very small Bird: It builds its Nest sometimes by the Walls of Houses, in the Backsides of Stables, or other Out-Houses that are co∣vered with Straw; but more commonly in Woods and Hedges. This Nest is of the figure of an Egg, erect upon one end, and hath in the middle of the side a Door, by which it goes in and out. It lays nine or ten, and sometimes more Eggs, at a sitting. It is strange to admiration, that so small a bodied Bird should cover so great a number of Eggs; and more strange, that it should feed such a Company of Young, and not miss one Bird, and that in the dark also. Be∣ing kept tame it sings very sweetly.</P>
<P N="71">71. TITMICE are a sort of sma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Birds, that are found for the most part about Trees; and live chiefly upon Insects which they find there. There are several sorts of these Birds, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Marsh Titmouse,</HI> or <HI>Black-cap;</HI> the <HI>Blue Titmouse</HI> or <HI>Nun;</HI> The <HI>Crested Titmouse;</HI> the <HI>Long-tail'd Titmouse,</HI> and some others. Some of these build in Holes of Trees: others make Nests of an oval figure, with an Hole left open in the side to go in and out at. They are restless Birds, ne∣ver sitting long still in a Place, but slitting from <HI>Bough</HI> to <HI>Bough,</HI> and from Tree, to Tree. They have short Bills, small Bodies, and long Tails.</P>
<P N="72">72. THE <HI>Long-tail'd</HI> INDIAN SPARROW is of equal bigness to our House-Sparrow. It hath a short thick Bill, of a scarlet Colour. Its Head is black∣ish, with a mixtu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of greenish Colour inclining to blue. The Wings are of three Colours chiefly; first, that now mentioned; secondly, a white, as appears in the figure; thirdly a black; to which succeeds fourthly, a yellowish Colour. The Throat and lower side of the Neck, the Breast, and Belly are white, The <HI>Tail</HI> is double, as in the Pecock; and also of two Colours, the lessere, which sustains the greater, being as it were its Prop, is white; the greater, consisting of four very narrow Feathers, of nine Inches

<P N="73">73. <HI>THE</HI> RING PARRAKEET is about fourteen Inches Long. Its Bill is thick, and all over red. The Head, and all the Body besides, green: but the Neck, Breast, and whole under Side, more faint, or pile: the upper Side deeper coloured.

<P N="74">74. <HI>THE</HI> FOOLISH SPARROW is in big∣ness equal to the Common Sparrow. The Colour of its whole Body is yellowish, spotted every where with oblong rusty, or rather red Spots, which on the Back are longer and bigger than elsewhere. The Bill is red, thick, and short: the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yes great. The Tail and Wings incline to black.</P>
<P N="75">75. <HI>THE</HI> Common HOUSE SPARROW is every where so well known, that I shall only present you with the Figure.</P>
<P N="76">76. <HI>THE</HI> BULFINCH is a very docile Bird, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l nearly imitate the Sound of a Pipe, or the Whistle of a Man with its Voice. This Bird is much e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teemed in <HI>England</HI> for its singing, and deservedly, for therein it is thought to excel all small Birds, if perchance you except the Linnet. The Head, for the proportion of the <HI>Body</HI> is great. In the Male, a lovely scarlet or crimson Colour adorns the <HI>Breast,</HI> Throat, and Jaws, as far as the Eyes. The Crown of the Head is black; the Rump and Tail white: the Neck and Back grey, with a certain tincture of red: the Tail is black. The Cock is of equal begness

<P N="77">77. <HI>THE</HI> GOLDFINCH, or <HI>Thistle-Finch,</HI> is a very beautiful Bird: for the elegancy of its Colours, and sweetness of its singing. every where well known and highly esteemed. It is of a mild and gentle Na∣ture, as may even thence appear, that, presently af∣ter it is caught, without using any Art or Care, it will fall to its Meat and Drink; nor is it so sacred and affrighted at the Presence of a Man, as to strike its Bill and Wings against the side of its Cage, as most other Birds are wont to do. It builds its Nest in Thorns, and Trees; and lays sixteen Eggs.</P>
<P N="78">78. <HI>THE</HI> Common LINNET is about the size of a Goldfinch. It is kept in Cages with us for the sweetness of its Singing; for it hath a sweet Note, and is thought by some to excell all other small Birds. It builds in black or white Thorn Bushes; and lays four or sive Eggs.</P>
<P N="79">79 <HI>THE Red-headed</HI> LINNET is something Jess then the Common Linnet. The Crown of the Head is adorned with a red Colour, but not very bright and shining. The rest of the Head and Neck round about of an ash Colour. The Shoulders, Back, and covert Feathers of the Wings, are red: the B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east is tinctured with red. It hath a fine Note, equal to the Common Linnet: and boilds after the same manner with that Bird. It is common on the Sea Coasts.</P>

<P N="82">82. <HI>THE</HI> CANARY BIRD is of the begness of the common Titmouse. It hath a very sweet and shrill Note, which at one Breath continued for a long time, without Intermission, it can draw out sometimes in length, sometimes raise very high, by a various, and almost musical Inflection of its Voice, making ve∣ry pleasant and artificial Melody. The Sound it makes is very sharp, and so quavering, that some∣times, when it stretches and exercises its little Throat and Chaps, whistling with all its force, it vehement∣ly strikes, and even deafens the Ears of the Hearers with its shrillness. Many are delighted with this kind of its singing, many also are offended, saying that they are stunn'd and deafned with it.</P>
<P N="83">83. <HI>THE</HI> CRANE is a large bodled Fowl, weighing sometimes ten Pounds. Its Neck and Legs are very long. The top of the Head is black; from the Bill to the hinder Part covered with black Hairs or Bristles, rather than Feathers. The Throat and sides of the Neck are of a black Hue. The Back, Shoulders, covert Feathers of the Wings, Breast, and all the Belly, and Things, are ash-coloured. In the Fen-Countries in <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> and <HI>Cambridgeshire,</HI> there are great Flocks of Cranes; but whether or no they breed in <HI>England</HI> is not cartainly known. Tho the Crane be a Water Fowl, yet it is thought no to feed at all upon Fish, but only upon Herbs, Grain, and Seeds of divers sorts and also upon In∣fects. The Flesh of these Fowls is very savoury, and well tasted, not to say delicate.</P>
<P N="84">84. <HI>THE</HI> BALEARIC CRANE is in the shape of its Body like a Stork. It hath upon its Head a thick round Crest, made up with Bristles spread every way, like Hogs Bristles of the Colour of the Prickles of a common Hedghog; by which Note it may at first sight be known from all other Birds. It is found in the Country near <HI>Cape Verde.</HI> For bignes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is equal to our Country Crane This Bird roosts after the manner of a Peacock, whose Voice and Con∣ditions

<P N="85">85 The Common HERON is from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Claw four foot long, to the end of the Tail about thirty eight Inches. It hath a black Crest on the Head four Inches high, The Feathers on the crown of the Head and the Chin are white, The Neck white and ash coloured, tinctured with red, The throat white, being de∣licately painted with black Spots. The Brest, Back, and Wings, are various, inelining to yellow, ash, and black. It feeds upon Fishes, Frogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Herons, build sometimes on the tops of great Trees, like Rooks, and for the most part many together.</P>
<P N="86">86 The lesser ash-coloured Heron, called by the <HI>Germans</HI> the <HI>Night-Raven.</HI> is lesser than the common Heron, and hath a shorter Neck. Its back and crown are black: its neck ash coloured: its throat and belly tinctured with yellow. A white line is extended from the Eyes to the Bill. From the hinder part of the Head it hath a Crest of three Feathers five Inches long, hanging down over the Back; whereby it differs from all other Birds. Its Wings and Tail are of an ash colour: its Bill black: its Legs and Feet are of a yellowish green.

<P N="94">94. <HI>THE REDSHANK,</HI> is of a middle fize for bigness, between a Lapwing and a Snipe, approaching to the quantity of a Plover. The Head, and Back, are of a dusky ash Colour, spotted with black: the Throat is particolour'd of black and white, the black being drawn down longways the Feathers. the Breast is whiter with fewer Spots It is common on the sandy Shores about <HI>England</HI> every where. It breeds in Marshes, and, if any one come near its Nest, it flies about, making a'great noise, like the Lapwing.</P>
<P N="95">95. <HI>THE LAPWING,</HI> is a Bird in all Countries well known: and every where to be met with, In the North of <HI>England</HI> they call it <HI>Te-wit</HI> from its Cry. It is of the bigness of a common Pigeon. It lays four or five Eggs, of a dirty yellow, all over painted with great black Spots, and Strokes. It builds its Nest on the Ground, in the middle of some Field or Heath, open, and exposed to view, laying only some few Straws, or Bents, under the Eggs, that the Nest be not seen: the Eggs being so like in Colour to the Ground on which they lie, it is not easy to find them, though they lie so open. The Young so soon as they are hatcht, instantly forsake the Nest, run∣ning away with the thick Down, and follow the Old ones like Chickens. They say a Lapwing, the fur∣ther you are from her Nest, the more clamorous she is, the nearer you are to it, the quieter she is, and less concerned she seems, that she may draw you from the true Place. and induce you to think it is, where it is not.</P>
<P N="96">96. <HI>THE</HI> Tame <HI>SWAN</HI> is much the biggest of all whole-footed Water Fowl with broad Bills; some of them weighing about twenty Pounds. The whole
<PB N="139" REF="144"/>Body is covered with a soft, delicate Plumage, in the Old ones purely white, in the Young ones grey. It is a very long-lived Fowl, so that it is thought to attain the Age of three hundred Years, which by some has been doubted of. My Author says, for his part, he could easily be induced to believe it: for that he had been assured, by credible Persons, that a Goose will live an hundred Years or more. But that a Swan is much longer lived than a Goose, he bring∣eth many convincing Arguments to prove. The Swan feeds not upon Fish, but either upon Herbs growing in the Water, and their Roots and Seeds, or upon Worms and other Insects, and Shell fish. Its Flesh is black, hard, and tough, being no desirable Dain∣ty. yet for its rarity, serves as a Dish to adorn Great Men's Tables, at Feasts and Entertainments. It lays seven or eight Eggs, and sits near two Months before its Young ones be hatcht.</P>
<P N="97">97. <HI>THE</HI> Tame <HI>GOOSE</HI> I shall say but little of, it being well known in all Nations. It is lesser than a Swan, hat bigger than a Duck. The Colour in these, as in other came Birds, is various; in some brown, in some grey, <HI>&amp;c</HI> When it is angry, it hisses like a Serpent. It is very long lived, as has been mentioned in the Description of the Swan.</P>

About the beginning of Winter, these Birds are said to come into <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> where they conti∣nue two or three Months about the Sea-shores, and away again. They sly in Flocks. If fat, they are accounted excellent Meat.</P>
<P N="101">101. <HI>THE</HI> RUFF, whose Female is called a <HI>Reeve,</HI> is bigger than the Knot. In the Cock Birds, a <HI>Circle,</HI> or Collar of long Feathers, something re∣sembling a Rufff, encompasse, the Neck under the Head; whence they took the Name of Ruffs. There is wonderful, and almost infinite variety in the Co∣lours of the Feathers of the Cocks; so that in the Spring time, there can scarce be found any two exact∣ly alike one to another. After Midsummer, when they have moulted their Feathers, they say they be∣come all alike again. The Hens are somewhat less than the Cocks; they change not their Colours. These Birds breed in Summer time, in the Fens of <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> about <HI>Crowland.</HI> They are fatted with white Bread and Milk, as are also Knots, being shut up in close dark Rooms: for let in but the Light upon them, presently they fall a fighting; never giv∣ing over till one hath killed the other, especially if any body stand by. The Fowlers when they see them intent upon fighting, spread their Nets over them, and catch them before they be aware.</P>
<P N="102">102. <HI>THE Brasilian TAMATIA</HI> is of the bignesss of a Lark or small Woodpecker, all spotted like a Throstle or Mavis: on the Belly it hath white Fea∣thers, with dusky Spots. It is yellow under the Throat, as also about the Neck. It hath a long red Bill. Above the Nostrils stand up certain slender Feathers, like Hairs, or Bristles. Its Head and Bill are bigger than the proportion of the Body requires.</P>
<P N="103">103. <HI>THE COOT</HI> is a pretty large Bird, weigh∣ing about twenty four Ounces. The Feathers about the Head, and Neck, are low, soft, and thick. The Colour all over the Body is black, deeper about the Head. It builds its Nest of Grass, broken Reeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="148"/>floating on the top of the Water, so that it rises and falls together with the Water: the Reeds, among which it is built, stop it that it be not carried down Streams. This Bird in the figure and make of its Body resembles a Water-Hen. It seldom sits upon Trees. The Flesh of it with us is accounted no good Meat: in <HI>Italy</HI> is more esteemed.</P>
<P N="103">103. <HI>THE</HI> GREEN PLOVER is about the bigness of a Lapwing, weighing about nine Ounces. The Colour of the whole upper side is black, thick∣set with yellowish green Spots: the Breast is brown, spotted with yellowish green: the Belly white. Its Flesh is sweet and tender, and therefore highly esteemed, and accounted a choice Dish, as well in <HI>England</HI> as beyond Seas. This Bird from its Spots, something resembling those of a Leopard, is called <HI>Pardali.</HI></P>
<P N="104">104. <HI>THE</HI> GREY PLOVER is about the size of the former. Its Head, Back, and lesser covert Peathers of the Wings, are black, with tips of a greenish grey: the Chin is white: the Throat spot∣ted with brown or dusky Spots: the Breast, Belly, and Thighs, are white. The Flesh also of this Bird is very tender, savoury, and delicate; and in no less esteem than that of the former.</P>
<P N="105">105. <HI>THE</HI> DOTTREL is something less than the Plover. It is a very foolish Bird, but excellent Meat, and with some accounted a great Delicacy. It is taken in the Night time, by the Light of a Candle, by imitating the Gestures of the Fowler: for, if he stretches out an Arm, that also stretches out a Wing; if he a Foot, that likewise a Foot: in brief, whatever the Fowler doth, the same doth the Bird; and so being intent upon Men's Gestures, it is deceived, and covered with the Net spread for it. It is accounted a foolish Bird, even to a Proverb, we calling a foolish dull Person a <HI>Dottrel.</HI></P>
<P N="106">106. <HI>THE</HI> Common WATER-HEN, or <HI>Moor-Hen,</HI> is bigger than the Plover. The Breast is of a lead Colour: the Belly inclining to grey, or ash Co∣lour: the Back all over blackish. As it swims or walks it often firts up its Tail. It will feed very fat.

These two Boats lies at some small distance from the Ship, each separated from the other, fastened to the Ice with thier Boat-hooks, ready to let go in an Instant, at the first sight of the Whale.

But the greatest Care is to be taken of the Tail. with which it many times does very great damage, both to the Boats and Mariners. The Harpinneer, who is placed in the Head, or Bow of the Boat, seeing the back of the Whale, and making an onset, thrusts the Harping-Iron with all his Might into its Body, by the help of a Staff fixed in it for that purpose, and leaves it in: a Line being fasten'd to it of of about two Inches in circomference, and 136 Fathom long. Every Boat is furnish'd with seven of these Lines; which being let run, from the Motion of it they observe the Course of the Fish. As soon as ever the Harpinneer has struck the Whale, the third Man in the Boat holds up his Oar, with an Hat on the top, as a Signal to the Ship; at the sight of which, the Man who is appointed to watch gives the Alarm to those that are asleep; who instant∣ly let fall their other four Boats, which hang on the Tackles, two on each side, ready to let go at a Mi∣nutes warning, all furnish'd alike with six Men each, Harping-irons, Lances, Line, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> two or three of these Boats row to the pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce where the Fish may be expected to come up again, the other to assist the <HI>Boat</HI> that first struck the Whale with Line; for the Fish will sometimes run out two or three <HI>Boats</HI> Lines, all fastened to each other: for, when the Lines of the first <HI>Boat</HI> are almost run out, they throw the end to the second, to be fastened to theirs, and then fol∣low the other <HI>Boats,</HI> in pursuit of the Whale; and so likewise does the second <HI>Boat,</HI> when their Lines are run out, A Whale sometimes, when she is first struck,

The Harp∣ing-Iron would but little avail to the Destruction of this Animal, but part of the Rowers, either at the first Onset, or, when in order to fetch its Breath it discovers it self to view; throwing aside their Oars, and taking up their very sharp Lances, they thrust it through the Body, till they see it spurt the Blood through its Blower; the sight of which is a most joyful Sign of the Creature's being mortally wound∣ed. The Fishermen, upon the killing of a Whale, are each intitled to some small Reward. After the Whale is killed, they cut all the Lines that are fas∣tened to it, and the Tail off; then it instantly turns on its Back; so they tow it to the Ship, where they fasten Ropes, to keep it from sinking; and, when it is cold, begin to cut it up. The Body of a Whale is frequently found to be eighteen or twenty Inches thick of Fat; and yields fifty or sixty Puncheons of Oil, each Puncheon conta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning seventy four Gallons, and about twelve hundred Pieces of Whalebone, most of which are about fifteen Foot long, and twelve Inches broad, which are all taken our of the Jaws, being the Gills of the Fish: The whole Produce of a Whale being worth One thousand Pounds, sometimes more, or less, according to the Goodness of the Fish. Whilst the Men are at work on the Back of the Fish; they have Spurs on their Boots, with two Prongs, which come down on each side of their Feet, left they should slip, the Back of the Whale being very slippery. These Ships have Orders to quit those Seas by the twenty fourth of <HI>June;</HI> for then the Fish begin to gender, and are very mischievous.

While they swim, it is not easy to distinguish the Male from the Female, unless from hence, that the latter is bigger than the former.

About five Years ago the <HI>Triton,</HI> one of our <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company's Ships, kill'd a Female Whale; and, whilst they were cutting her up a long Side, a Young one swam about the Ship, and would not forsake the Dam; till at length the Commodore order'd the Boot out to go and kill it: which they did; and it produced four Puncheons of.

The Head and Month of this Fish are large, in proportion to the rest of the Body. The number of its Teeth is altogether uncertain, and va∣ries according to the Age of the Fish; it having been observed and delivered by Men worthy of cre∣dit, that this Kind breeds new Teeth every Year as long as it lives. It is said to have three Rows of Teeth, very hard, strong, and sharp.

The Mouth is wide; the Eyes small; the under Jaw longer than the upper, with two Rows of small sharp Teeth. It has two Fins, one on each side his Gills; two small ones under its Belly; two near the Tail; and one on the Ridge of the Back. It has its Name from its sucking the Shark<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. It is of a very slimy Nature, and commonly st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks
<PB N="157" REF="162"/>so fast to Sharks and other large Fish, as not to be easily got off. It is said, that Remoras are wont to cleave to the Keels of Ships, and hinder their Course.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>THE</HI> DOLPHIN is a large Fish, not much unlike the Porpesse. It swims with two strong Fins, which, like the Arms of a Man, are joyned to the Shoulder-blades; and is said to be of that swiftness, that is will easily overtake a Ship in full sail before the Wind. It produces its Young from Seed, and not from Spawn, perfect, one at a time, and some∣times two: It goes with Young ten Months; and breeds only in the Summer. It lives about twenty five or thirty Years. They say that it is a most cer∣tain Foreboder of a Tempest shortly to follow, when it more frequently moves its Body, and sports it self on the Water. They are much deceived, who ima∣gine Dolphins to be of the Figure they are usually represented on Signs: that Error being more owing to the unbridled Licence of Statuaries, or Painters, than to any such thing found in fact: Tho' it must be own'd, that at the approach of a Storm, whilst the Dolphins leaping and springing from the Waves, are seen to precipitate themseves into the Deep, they are wont to deceive our Sight, and at that time have some resemblance of Crookedness. It is said it will live a long time out of the Water: One taken at <HI>Ri∣mini</HI> (according to <HI>Ges<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI>) lived three Days upon Land. Dolphins sometimes swim in Sholes, some∣times the Male and Female together, but never singly. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illius</HI> says, that, when he was in a Ship where many Dolphins were taken, he observed them so to deplore with Groans, Lamentations, and a Flood of Tears, their Condition, that he himself out of Compassion could not forbear weeping, and threw that which he observ'd to groan more than ordinary (the Fisherman being asleep) into the Water; as choosing rather to damage the Fishman, than not to relieve the misera∣ble But this gave him but little rest, for all the others increased their Groans, as seeming, by not ob∣scure Signs, to beg the same Deliverance. It has been related, that Dolphins have been in great request for Food with Princes, and purchas'd at and excessive Rate; tho' according to the Accounts of some, their Flesh yields no very grateful Taste.</P>

<P N="6">6. <HI>THE</HI> FLYING FISH is slender and long, with a large Eye. The Body is in Shape, Scales, and Colour, like to one of our Mullets. The Wings and Fins are as represented in the Figure. It flies near a Gun shot before it touches the Water; and, when it has wet its Wings, mounts up again: Being chased by the Dolphin, which swims so swift that it often catches it as it drops into the Water.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>THE</HI> SEA UNICORN is a Fish often found about <HI>Iceland, Greenland,</HI> and other Northern Islands; somewhat of the Nature of a Whale. On the top of the left Part of the upper Jaw, or Fore-head, it hath one only Tooth, or Horn, of a large size, being six or seven Foot in length, sometimes more; and in thickness equal, in proportion to its length; st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight and tapering, curl'd, or twisted a∣bout to the end. The Female is said to have no Horn, but a Dint or Hollow in that place of her Forehead. The Horn is made use of by the <HI>Dutch</HI> as Ivory. This Fish is about nine Foot in length. It Casts its Young like the Wale, which is after the manner of Land Animals: And is supposed to re∣ceive them into her Belly, when in danger. One of our <HI>Greenland</HI> Ships, about two or three Years ago, found a Female of this Kind dead on the Ice, and in the Belly of it a Female Young one, which was in length, from the tip of its Snout to the end of its Tail, six Foot. It is not to be supposed that a Young one of that bigness had been never brought forth; or that the Dam devour'd it for Food; but rather that it took it in, to secure it from some great danger. This Account I had from two Persons wor∣thy of Credit, who were Eye witnesses of this Fact.</P>

<P><HI>THE</HI> POR<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ESSE is in length from the tip of its Snout to the end of the Tail about three or
<PB N="161" REF="166"/>four Foot, and about two Foot and half thick. Its Figure is somewhat longish and roundish, continually tapering towards the Tail. It is cover'd with a slen∣der, thin Skin, not fenced with Scales. The Colour of the Back is of a dark blue, inclining to black; from the middle of the sides it begins to whiten, the Belly altogether white: Its Eyes, for the bigness of the Fish, are very small. It has only three Fins, like the Dolphin; one on the middle of the Back, and one on each Shoulder: the Tail is forked. When this Fish is cut up, its Flesh looks very much like Pork. There are great Numbers of Porpesses seen on our <HI>English</HI> Coasts, especially in Mackrel and Her∣ring Seasons: at which times they are wont to do very great damage to our Fishermen, by breaking and destroying their Nets to get at the fish; and sometimes so entangle and wrap themselves up in them, that they are often taken. Porposses swim but a very little way at a time, before they come up to breathe; and, when they come up, blow or breathe very loud, so that in calm Weather they may be heard at a great distance: These Fish will sometimes pursue their Prey close to the Shore, nay even in the very Harbours. I my self have seen a Porposse more than once come within half a Stone's Cast of the Houses. When they come up to breathe, great part of their Body is seen.</P>

It swims with broad Fins. The Tail is broad, and somewhat forked, of a Colour between a red and black; as is also the last Fin; it has no Tongue; but in the room of that, Nature has given it a fleshy Palate, that it may relish its Food.

Some of them are of a yellowish, firy Colour; having sharp Backs, like, Saws. These also have Beards. When they set up their Scales, they shine like Silver. The Apples of their Eyes are (as it is said) precious Stones, and as bright as fire, in which it is affirm'd there is great virtue against many Disseases. Their Aspect is very fierce and terrible. Some Dragons are said to have

Some do affirm that a Dragon is of a black Colour: the Belly somewhat green, and very beautiful: that it has a tripple row of Teeth in each Jaw; and very bright shining Eyes. That it has also two Dewlaps growing under the Chin, which hang down like a Beard, of a red Colour and the Body is set all over with sharp Scales; and on the Neck with thick Hair, much like the Bidles of a wild Boar.</P>

<P N="7">7. The <HI>VIPER,</HI> or Adder, is about a Foot and a half in length. The Tail curl'd at the End, very small, and sharp. The Head is very broad, compar'd with the Body; and the Neck much nar∣rower than the Head. It is commonly black on the Back, sometimes Greenish, or yellowish. The Eyes are very red, and flaming. The Belly winding, upon which it goeth, and slides along very nimply. Its Teeth upon the upper Chap is very long, and upon either side it hath four. Those upon the lower Chap are so small, that they can scarce be seen, but the length of the Teeth cannot be seen, except you take away a little Bladder, in which they lie con∣ceal'd: in which Bladder it carries Poyson, which it instantly infuseth into the Wound it make with its Teeth. The Scales of a Viper are more sharp than a Snake<HI>'s;</HI> and it is of a hotter Nature than a Snake; and therefore lives more in the Shade, and lies for the most part quil'd up lipe a Rope, It is a crafty venemous Creature, biting suddenly those that pass by it. It is said, that, when a Viper is thirsty, and goes to drink, she first of all voids up hut, Ve∣nom, lest by drinking it descends into her own Bow∣els, and so destroy herself: and, when she has drank, licks it up again. Vipers are bred in most Na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>blia of the World: those of <HI>Europe</HI> are much less than those of many other Countries. The Viper is said

<P N="8">8. OF <HI>FROGS,</HI> there are two Kinds, one liv∣ing both on the Land and in the Water, and com∣mon in Marshes, standing Pools. running Streams, and banks of Rivers; but never in the Sea, The other sort is frequently in Gardens, Meadows, hol∣low Rocks and among Fruit. The Frog in shape very much resembles a Toad, it is without Venom. and the Female is greate than the Male. The fore part of the Tongue cleaveth to the Mouth, as in a Fish, the hinder to the Throat, by which it send∣eth fourth its Voice. It hath two Bladders upon ei∣ther side of the Mouth, which it filleth with Wind, and from thence proceedeth the Voice. When it croaketh, it putteth its Head out of the Water, hold∣ing the nether Lip even with the Water, and the upper Lip above the Water; and this is the Voice of rife Male provoking the Female to Lust. The hind Legs are very long, which they use in leaping, the fore Legs are shorter, having divided Claws, which are joyned together with a thin, broad Skin, which helpeth them in swimming. It is said that <HI>Frogs</HI> in the Witer-time hide <HI>themselves</HI> in the Earth, and <HI>sometimes</HI> they enter into their <HI>Holes</HI> in Au∣tumn, before Winter, and in the spring-time come out again.</P>

Presently after the Toad return'd to seek it; and, not finding it, according to her Ex∣pectation, swelled and burst asunder: for having re∣ceived Poison from the Spider in the Combat, Na∣ture taught her the Virtue of that Herb. to expel and drive it out; but wanting the Herb, the Poison did instantly work, and destroy Her.</P>

The Food of these Caterpillars is the Leaves of Elm trees. When the time of their Transformation draws nigh, they be∣take themselves to Houses or Barns; there they fas∣ten their hinder Members of their Bodies to a cer∣tain Wall, Board, or Table, hanging with their Head downwards; that, when they have perfected their transmutation, they may the more easily get out of the Crust or Shell they are inclosed in. Be∣fore that, in the Assumtion of their new Shape, when they put off their old Skin, they seem anxiously to labour, by shaking, tossing, tnd trembling, as if they were seized with an accute Fever And this wonderfull Change is produc'd in a very short space of time, insomuch that it may be distinctly seen and observ'd: for no sooner is the old Skin laid aside, than this Transfiguration is seen. This Caterpillar began to be changed the 12th of <HI>June;</HI> and on the 30th of the same Munth became a most peautifull Butterfly. It would be an endless Task to enume∣rate the very great variety of Butterflys, and Ca∣terpillars, with respect to their Colours, and other different Properties.

<P N="11">11. The <HI>LOUSE,</HI> is a Creature so officious, that it will be known to every one at one time or other; so busy, and so impudent, that it will be intruding it self in every one<HI>'s</HI> Company; and so proud and aspiring withal, that it fears not to trample on the best, and affects nothing so much as a Crown. feeds and lives very high, and that makes it so faucy, as to pull any one by the Ears that comes in its way, and will never be quiet till it had drawn Blood; it is troubled at nothing so much as at a Man that scratches his Head, as knowing that Man is plotting
<PB N="204" REF="207"/>and contriving some Mischief against it; and that makes it oftentimes Sculk into some meaner and low∣er Place, and run behind a Man<HI>'s</HI> Back, though it go very much against the Hair; which ill Conditions of it have made it better known than trusted. The Figure, taken by the Microscope. represents it climb∣ing on an Hair, with its Belly upwards. It is a Creature of a very odd shape: it has an Head shap∣ed like that express'd in the Figure; on either side behind the Head (being the Place where other Crea∣ture<HI>'s</HI> Ears stand) are placed in two black shining, goggle Eyes, looking backwards, and fenced round with several small Hairs that incumpass it, It has two Horns that grow before it, in the Place where one would have thought the Fyes should be; each of these have four Joynts, which are fringed, as it were, with small Bristles: the Head seems very round and tapeting, ending in a very sharp Nose, <HI>which</HI> seems to <HI>have</HI> a small Hole, and to be <HI>the</HI> passage <HI>through which he</HI> sucks <HI>the</HI> Blood. It hath six Legs, cover∣ed with a very transparent Shell, and jointed exactly like a Crab<HI>'s</HI> or Lobster<HI>'s;</HI> each is divided into six Parts by these Joynts, and those have here and there several small Hairs: and at the end of each Leg it it has two Claws, very properly adapted for its pecu∣liar use, being thereby inabled to walk very secure∣ly both on the Skin and Hair. The Belly is cover∣ed with a transparent Substence likewise; for it is grained all over the Belly, just like the Skin in the Palm of a Man<HI>'s</HI> Hand.</P>

<P N="13">13. <HI>THE</HI> BEE, that noble, tho' small, Insect, is about three quarters of an Inch long, having four Wings curiously shap'd, with strong Fibres round and cross them; six Legs, a large Head, but very small Neck, and very slender in the Waste, or mid∣dle Part. Nature hath provided it with two sorts of Instruments for War and Defense, <HI>viz.</HI> her Mouth, wherein are her Teeth, that meet sideways, and not one over the other; with which it defends itself, and assaults others: And the Sting, which is in its Tail. With its Fangs it lays hold on Robbers, which come to steal its Honey, whilst another comes to its assistance with its Sting, which generally car∣ries Death to any of its own Kind that it pierces; and, for the most part, Death to itself, when it pierces any of the humane Species. The Sting is very taper and sharp, apt, when exerted by the Bee, to pierce the Skin, or other harder Body. It con∣tains its Poison about the middle of it, which may be discover'd by the help of Glasses. The Eyes are very large, cover'd over with a thick horny Mem∣brane, which occasions the dimness of its Sight. But, to supply this Defect, Nature hath given it two Horns, which grow above its Eyes, about the tenth of and Inch long, in each of which there are two Joints, one in the middle, and another near the end, by which it can put them forth, when it will, to the full length, and draw them in at pleasure. These are its Instruments of Feeling. The Tongue is much longer than the Mouth will contain, and so is doubled underneath, and reacheth a good way down the Breast. The Body is all over hairy, like a Fox, and the Head too, nay a great part of the Eyes is cover∣ed with small Hairs, but so small, that they cannot be discern'd by the naked Eye, without the help of Microscope, which will also discover the Brain in
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>the Head. Within the Breast it hath a reddish Flesh, with Heart and Lungs, proper Instruments for breathing. In the hinder Parts there is a Gut, <HI>&amp;c</HI> as also a Bottle or Bag, in which it carries its Ho∣ney, which it emptieth into the Honey-comb. In this Bag it often fetches Water, to mix up its Sanda∣rach, or Bee-bread, for the feeding its Young; a∣bout which it is very careful, till they can shift for themselves. That, which has commonly been call'd the <HI>Drone,</HI> appears at length to be nothing else but the Male Bee, and is about half as big again as the Female, which only is the working Bee, somewhat longer, and not quite so dark-colour'd about the Head and Shoulders; especially his Head and Eyes much larger than the Honey-Bee, his Voice more loud and dread∣ful, often causing Fear where no Fear is, especially to the fair and timorous Sex: for he, having no Sting, cannot in the least hurt any Creature, but is wholly under the Dominion of the Females. He is smooth about his Neck, and very hairy all over his Back. His Tongue is much shorter than that of the <HI>Females;</HI> neither can he work if he would, his Tongue not being long enough to reach the Honey out of the socketed Flowers. This Male Bee, or suppos'd <HI>Drone,</HI> is not only helpful, but necessary to the Females, in the managing of their Young: for, by his great Heat, he sits, and hatches the Brood, keeping the Eggs warm, whilst the Honey Bees, or Females, follow their delightful Vocation of gather∣ing and bringing home of Honey: During which time the <HI>Drone</HI> Bees are not suffer'd to stir from the Brood, but about one or two of the Clock, when the chief part of the Day's Work is over with the Bees, most of them, repairing home, take care of their own Brood; and so give leave to these their obedient masculine Servants, to recreate themselves abroad; their Heat now being no longer necessary within doors. Then you shall see the Male Bees thick about the Mouth of the Hive, flying to and fro five or six large Circuits, to recreate and empty themselves, then returning again to their beloved Honey, where they are for a time, especially in <HI>May</HI>

<PB N="209" REF="212"/>and <HI>June.</HI> their chief breeding times, kindly receiv'd by their imperious Dames. The forward Stocks of Bees begin to breed in <HI>February;</HI> and the latter, or those that are not so lusty, leave not off till the lat∣ter end of <HI>July.</HI> So that there are six Mouths in which Bees are bred; and, the sooner they begin, the sooner they make an end; tho' generally there are more Bees bred in the two Months of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> than all the rest. It must notwithstanding be own'd, that, according to the Forwardness, or Back∣wardness of the Spring, the chief Months may be sooner, or later. A Bee is first an Egg: This Egg, which in time becomes a Bee, is exceeding white, something bigger than the common Fly-blow, but not so long not big, as an Ant's Egg. The Eggs of Bees are cast into the empty Cells; not carelesly into any Cells, but only the middle Cells, which are al∣ways appointed for the breeding Cells, whilst those all round the Hive are reserv'd for the Honey. The Eggs of Bees, when first hatch'd, are Maggots, before they become Bees. In the warm Weather, how long so∣ever it continue, the Bees leave their Hives in quest of Honey; as seeming to be sensible, that, if they should lose the Opportunity of gathering Honey in the Spring, and cold Weather should come in, espe∣cially if the Stock be not very rich, many young Bees coming to hand that must be fed, and the bad Weather continuing to hinder their provident Mo∣thers from working, both Young and Old must dye together. In warm wet Weather, when they cannot go abroad, they bury their Dead; which they do by flying with them some distance from the Hive, and dropping them. Bees hardly live above a Year, or thereabouts. The Bee hath several Enemies, <HI>viz.</HI> the Mouse, which in the cold Weather, when the Bees are not in vigour, will enter in at the Mouth of the Hive; and, first, gnaw the lowermost part of the Comb, where there is but here and there a little Honey; but waxing bolder, as the cold Weather in∣creases, and the Bees are more still, ascends into the Hive, and seizes on those Combs which are next to the sides of the Hive, where commonly the richest
<PB N="210" REF="213"/>Treasure lies, will eat Holes thro' them, and so come and go thro' them at pleasure. This Fact of the Mouse exposes them to other Enemies, <HI>viz.</HI> the Bees of other Stocks, who, smelling the fresh Honey, come in like Thieves, when a Neighbour's House is on Fire, not to help the distressed, but to plunder them of their remaining Goods. Now, tho' they should be able to defend themselves against these lat∣ter Enemies, yet conceiving a Distaste against their Hive, by reason of the detestable Smell of the Mice, they take a warm Day, and fly away all together, tho' perhaps to an equal, if not a greater, exposing themselves to Death, than if they had staid at home: and have sometimes left Quarts of Honey behind them. The Bee hath, besides the Mouse, these Ene∣mies following, <HI>viz.</HI> the Moth, the Ear-wig, the Hornet, the Wasp, the Swallow, and the Sparrow: of which, as well as of many other things relating to the Bees, those, who desire farther Accounts, I refer to them who have distinctly treated of these Insects, particularly to Mr. <HI>Joseph Warder</HI>'s <HI>True Amazons,</HI> or <HI>Monarchy of Bees.</HI> From which Treatise I have extracted this Account of Bees; that Gentleman, from his nice, curious, and long Observations on this pleasant, and no less profitable Subject, being thought to have discover'd more of the Nature, Pro∣perties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Bees, than any that went before him. The Queen Bee is of all Bees the most glorious. Her Body is much bigger and longer than that of the Honey-Bee: yet her Wings are no longer than the other's; which shews, that she is not design'd for Labour, not long Flights, which is the continual Business of her Subjects. As to her Shape and Co∣lour, her upper Parts are of a lighter brown than the rest: her hinder Part from the Waste, (which is very small) as it is much longer than that of the Drone or Honey-Bee, so is it much more taper than their<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And, whereas the Drone and Common Bee are brown all over the hinder Part, the Queen in that Part<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as black as Jet, or polish'd black Marble. And, whereas the two great Legs of the Commons are quite Black, hers are all as yellow as Gold, as also
<PB N="211" REF="214"/>she is all along the under Part of the Belly. In sort, the Queen doth as far surpass her Subjects in Shape and Beauty, as the finest Horse does the com∣mon F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrester. And, as she does far surpass her Subjects in Shape and Beauty, so she also differs from them in Breeding. First, the Egg of her Royal Mother is cast into a Cell, made by her Vassals for that very purpose, different from the rest, being ex∣actly round, much thicker in Wax, and the Cell, proportionably to her Body, much larger than those the common Bees make for themselves. But this round Palace is never among other Cells, but always by it self. No Monarch has a completer Submission from his Subjects, than the Queen-Bee from the common Bees. Bees swarms most in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> tho' sometime in <HI>April,</HI> and often in <HI>Ju∣ly.</HI> There happen frequent and desperate Wars a∣mongst the Bees, one Party sometimes endeavouring to plunder another of its Honey; for which it will fight vigorously: But, if it should so happen, that the plunder'd Bees have lost their Queen, then they will side with the Robbers, and suffer the Honey to be carried all out of their Hive. Sometimes Bees driven from their own Hives, and seeking new Quarters, by that means occasion great Battles.</P>
<P N="14">14. THE SCORPION is an Insect of <HI>Persia,</HI> &amp;c. The coal black Scorpion is accounted the most venemous; and is, both in thickness and length, a∣bout the size of a Man's Finger. The Body some∣what resembles an Egg, and altogether is like a Craw-fish; only it has a blunter Head, and a less Body. It has eight-Legs, and two Claws. It has a long, knotted Tail, which Knots appear like so ma∣ny little Bladders; at the end of which it has a very venomous Sting. Some Scorpions are said to have two Stings in their Tails; and some to have venomous Teeth, with which they give a deadly B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te.
