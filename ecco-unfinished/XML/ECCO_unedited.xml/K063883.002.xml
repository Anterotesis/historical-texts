<HEAD>THE
TRYAL
OF
MERVIN Lord AUDLEY,
Earl of Castlehaven, for SODO∣MY,
&amp;c. April the 25th, 1631.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Arraignment.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Lord <HI>Coventry,</HI> Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal of
<HI>England,</HI> was appointed Lord
High Steward for that Day,
who having Orders for the
said Tryal from his Majesty,
gave Directions for the same.</P>
<P>The Lords the Peers took their Places
about Eight of the Clock in the Morning,
and were seated on Benches on each Side of
a large Table cover'd with green Cloth,
and below them were the Judges plac'd,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
and the King's learned Council, and the
Officers of the Court; and having dispos'd
of themselves in their several Places, the
Lord Steward about Nine of the Clock en∣ter'd
the Hall uncover'd, with seven Maces
carry'd before him by seven Serjeants at
Arms, and was attended upon by Sir <HI>John
Burroughs,</HI> Garter-Principal King of Arms,
and Mr. <HI>James Maxwell,</HI> Usher of the Black
Rod.</P>
<P>After the Lord Steward had saluted all
the Lords the Peers, (who saluted him a∣gain)
he presently ascended the State; and
being seated in the Chair, he was presented
with his Majesty's Commission, by one of
the Masters of the <HI>Chancery,</HI> which bore
Date the 13th of <HI>April, 1631.</HI></P>
<P>After he had receiv'd the said Commis∣sion,
he commanded an <HI>O Yes</HI> to be made,
by one of the Serjeants at Arms, for a ge∣neral
Silence; and then deliver'd the said
Commission to Sir <HI>Thomas Fanshaw,</HI> Clerk
of the Crown, to be openly read: Which
being done, Mr. <HI>Maxwell</HI> kneel'd down, and
presented his Lordship with a White-Staff
Verge of State, which he gave to one of
the Serjeants at Arms, who held the same
up by the Cloth of State, on the right
Hand thereof; and after the Commission
was read, and the Staff receiv'd as afore∣said,
his Grace commanded a solemn <HI>O
Yes</HI> to be made, and then gave Leave to all
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
the Lords the Peers, and the Judges, and
to all Privy-Councellors there present to be
cover'd; and Command was given, that
none under that Degree should keep on
their Hats, upon Pain of Imprisonment;

their Names, and each of them answer'd

<P>This done, the Lord Steward, after a
solemn Precognizance, commanded the In∣dictments
to be certify'd and brought in;
and then, by a Serjeant at Arms, the Lieu∣tenant
of the Tower was call'd to bring
forth the Prisoner, (who until that Time
was kept in a little Room by the <HI>Common-Pleas)</HI>
and the Lieutenant brought him to
the Bar, with divers of the Guard attend∣ing
on him, where he had a Place in man∣ner
of a Pew, lin'd with Green, in which
he stood; and the Lieutenant had another
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
of the same Form for him to rest in, ad∣joining
to it; and when he had done his
Obeysance to the Lord High Steward and
the Peers, (who all resaluted him again)
the Lord High Steward spake to him in the
Manner following:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Lord High Steward's Speech.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord <HI>Audley,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE King hath understood, both by
Report and the Verdict of divers Gen∣tlemen
of Quality in your own Country,
that you stand impeach'd of sundry Crimes
of a most high and heinous Nature; and to
try whether they be true or not, and that
Justice may be done accordingly, his Ma∣jesty
brings you this Day to your Tryal,
doing herein like the mighty King of Kings,
in the 18th of <HI>Genesis,</HI> ver. 20, 21. who
went down to see whether their Sins were
so grievous as the Cry of them. <HI>Because the
Cry of</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah <HI>is great, and
their Sins be grievous, I will go down</HI> (saith
the Lord) <HI>and see whether they have done al∣together
according to the Cry of it.</HI> And Kings
on Earth can have no better Pattern to fol∣low
than the King of Heaven; and there∣fore
our Sovereign Lord the King, God's
Vicegerent here on Earth, hath commanded
that you shall be here try'd this Day; and,
to that End, hath caus'd these Peers to be
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
assembled; and the Desire of his Majesty,
is, that your Tryal shall be as equal as
Equity and Justice itself; and therefore
these noble Men your Peers [whose Hearts
are as full of Integrity, Justice, and Truth,
as their Veins full of noble Blood] are this
Day to try you; wherefore if you be in∣nocent,
speak boldly and confidently, and
fear not to justify your self, and be assur'd
that those that accuse you [if you be free
your self] shall not escape free. But if
you be guilty of those Crimes, I advise you
to give Honour to God and the King, and
confess your Fault; for it is not vain Con∣fidence,
nor Subtilty, nor standing out in
Denial, that can hide the Truth; and all
Shifts and Subtilties against it are but <HI>Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilia
adversus Dominum;</HI> therefore, if Truth
touch you at the Heart, and your Consci∣ence,
which is a thousand Witnesses, and
God's Grace, which is greater than both,
stand not out against it. And if you do,
God will put it into the Hearts of these no∣ble
Persons to find it out, and to do that
which is just.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Lord Audley's Answer.</HEAD>
<OPENER>May it please your Grace,</OPENER>
<P>I Have been a close Prisoner these six
Months, without Friends, without Coun∣cil
or Advice: I am ignorant of Advanta∣ges
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
and Disadvantages of the Law, and am
but weak of Speech at the best, and there∣fore
I desire to have the Liberty of having
Council to speak for me.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Lord High Steward's Reply.</HEAD>
<P>FOR your so long Imprisonment, it hath
been to you a special Favour; for you
have had Time enough to bethink yourself,
and more than ever any Man had that
hath been committed for such an Offence,
and more Favour than ever any had that
came to this Bar; and you shall demand
nothing which the Law can allow, but you
shall have it. But for your Demand, I
must move it to the Lords the Judges, and
they shall satisfy you in it, or any other
Thing you desire.</P>
<P>Then his Grace desir'd to be resolv'd of the
Judges, whether this Demand of my Lord <HI>Aud∣ley,</HI>
to have a Council to plead for him, might
be granted or not?</P>
<P>The Judges answer'd, that in criminal
Cases Council is not to admitted for Mat∣ter
of Fact, but for Matter of Law they
may.</P>
<P>Then the Lord Steward proceeded to the
Charge, and commanded the three Indictments
to be read by Sir <HI>Tho. Fanshaw,</HI> Clerk of the
Crown; two for Sodomy with <HI>Lawrence Fitz-Patrick</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
his Footman, the third for a Rape
committed on his own Wife, the Countess of
<HI>Castlehaven.</HI> Then being ask'd whether he was
guilty of them or not guilty? He answer'd, Not
guilty.</P>
<P>Then he was ask'd how he would be try'd?
<HI>The Earl said, By God and my Peers:</HI>
Whereupon the Peers put off their Hats, and
thereupon the Issue was join'd.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Lord High Steward's Speech to the Lords.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Prisoner stands indicted for a Rape
by one Indictment, and of Sodomy
by two; and he hath pleaded not guilty to
them all: It is my Duty to charge you
with the Tryal of it, and you are to judge
of it.</P>
<P>The Offences wherewith he stands char∣ged,
are to be prov'd by Evidence; and
because the Crimes that come this Day be∣fore
us, may in some breed Detestation, and
the Person of his Lordship in others may
breed Compassion, I desire your Lordships
to set these two aside, and let your Reason
sway your Judgment, and let that rule
your Affections, and your Hearts your
Heads; for neither of these ought to be put
into the Ballance; for a Grain on either
Side may sway the Scale. You are to give
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
attentive Hearing, and then to weigh e∣qually,
that the Scale may lean the right
Way. The Judges will assist you in the
Point of Law, which if you doubt of, you
are to expound it to me, and I to them.
And this you are to do without corporal
Oath; for the Law conceiveth you of such
Integrity, that you will do that for Justice
which others do upon their Oaths, and
therefore admit of no Challenge, and God
direct you to do as you ought.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Then Sir Tho. Crew gave the first Charge▪
and after him Mr. Attorney said as followeth.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord Steward,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MAY it please your Grace, there are
three Indictments against <HI>Mervin</HI>
Lord <HI>Audley;</HI> the first for a <HI>Rape,</HI> the other
two for <HI>Sodomy.</HI></P>
<P>The Person is honourable; the Crimes of
which he is indicted dishonourable; which,
if it fall out to be true, [which is to be left
to Tryal] I dare be bold to say, never Poet
invented, nor Historian writ of any Deed
so foul. And altho' <HI>Suetonius</HI> hath curiously
set out the Vices of some of the Emperors
who had absolute Power, which might
make them fearless of all Manner of Pu∣nishment,
and besides were Heathens, and
know not God; yet none of these came
near this Lord's Crimes. The one is a
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Crime, that I may speak it to the Honour
of our Nation, is of such Variety, that we
seldom or never knew of the like; and for
the other, we scarce heard of the like; but
they are of such a pestilential Nature, that,
if they be not punish'd, they will draw
from Heaven a heavy Judgment upon this
Kingdom.</P>
<P>Whereupon (Mr. Attorney digressing from
the Matter) the Lord <HI>Audley</HI> would have in∣terrupted
him, and requir'd to hold him to the
Points in the Indictments. But the Lord High
Steward desir'd his Lordship to be patient, and
assur'd him he should be heard in fit Time at
full. Whereupon Mr. Attorney proceeded again
in his Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge as followeth.</P>
<P>May it please your Grace, I can speak
it with Joy and Comfort, that during all
my Time of Service, both in his Majesty's
Father's Time, and since he came to the
Crown, I had never the like Occasion to
speak in this Place against a Peer of the
Realm before now; and God knows I do it
now with Sorrow, and I hope I shall never
have the like Occasion to do so much again.
But his Majesty, who is the Pattern of Ver∣tue,
not only as King, but in his Person
also; in whom it is hard to judge whether
he most excels in Justice or Mercy; (but I
rather think in Mercy) for he would have
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
my Lord <HI>Audley</HI> (the Prisoner at the Bar)
heard with as much Favour as such a
Crime can admit; and when he first heard
of it, he gave strict Command that the
Truth should be search'd out, that his
Throne and People might be clear'd from
so heavy and heinous Sins; and thereupon
he was indicted in his own Country, ac∣cording
to the Law, and by Gentlemen of
Worth and Quality. The Bill was found;
and now he is personally brought to this
Bar, to be try'd by these his honourable
Peers, such, of whose Wisdom and Since∣rity
there can be no Question, but that he
shall have a just and honourable Tryal.
And first I shall begin with the Indictment
of Rape. <HI>Bracton</HI> tells us of King <HI>Athel∣stane</HI>'s
Law before the Conquest. <HI>If the Par∣ty
were of no chast Life, but a Whore, yet there
may be a Ravishment; but it is a good Plea to
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y she was his Concubine.</HI></P>
<P>In an Indictment of Rape, there is no
Time of Prosecution necessary; for <HI>nullum
Tempus occurr it Regi:</HI> But in Case of an Ap∣peal
of Rape, if the Woman did not pro∣secute
in convenient Time, it will bar
her.</P>
<P>If a Man take away a Maid by Force,
and ravish her, and afterwards she give
her Consent and marry him, yet it is a
Rape.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
For the <HI>Crimen Sodomiticum,</HI> our Law had
no Knowledge of it 'till the <HI>15 H. 8.</HI> by
which <HI>Statute</HI> it was made Felony; and in
this there is no more Question, but only
whether it be <HI>Crimen Sodomiticum sine P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne∣tratione;</HI>
and the Law <HI>15 Eliz.</HI> sets it down
in general Words; and where the Law doth
not distinguish, neither must we. And I
know you will be cautious how you will
give the least Mitigation to so abominable
a Sin, which brought such Plagues after it,
as we may see in <HI>Gen. 17. Levit. 18. Judg.
19. Rom. 1.</HI> But (my Lord) it seem'd to me
strange at the first, how a Nobleman of his
Quality should fall to such abominable
Sins; but when I found he had given him∣self
over to Lust, and that <HI>Nemo repente fit
Pessimus;</HI> and if once Men habit themselves
in ill, it is no Marvel if they fall into any
Sins; and that he was constant to no Reli∣gion,
but in the Morning he would be a
Papist and go to Mass, and in the After∣noon
a Protestant and go to a Sermon.
When I had consider'd these Things, I ea∣sily
conceiv'd, and shall be bold to give
your Grace a Reason why he became so ill.
He believ'd not God; he had not the Fear
of God before his Eyes; he left God, and
God left him to his own Wickedness; and
then what may not a Man run into? What
Sin so soul? What Thing so odious, which
he dares not adventure? But I find in him
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
Things beyond all Imagination, for I find
his ill Imagination and Intentions bent to
have his Wife naught with the wickedest
Man that ever I heard of before; for who
would not have his Wife vertuous and good,
how bad soever himself be? And I find
him Bawd to his own Wife. If she love
him, she must love <HI>Skipwith;</HI> (whom he ho∣nour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
above all) and not any honest Love,
but in a dishonest Love; and he gives his
Reasons by Scripture: <HI>She was now made
subject to him;</HI> and therefore if she did Ill
at his Command, it was not her Fault but
his, and he would answer it. His irregu∣lar
Bounty toward <HI>Skipwith</HI> was also re∣markable.
He lets this <HI>Skipwith</HI> (whom he
calls his Favourite) spend of his Purse
<HI>500 l. per Annum;</HI> and if his Wife or
Daughter would have any Thing, tho' ne∣ver
so necessary, they must lie with <HI>Skip∣with,</HI>
and have it from him, and not other∣wise,
also telling <HI>Skipwith</HI> and his Daugh∣ter-in-Law,
he had rather have a Child by
him than any other. But for these Things,
I had rather they should come forth of the
Witnesses Mouths than from me; and there∣upon
desir'd that the Proof might be read.</P>

more Means when he came to my Lord
<HI>Audley,</HI> but the Mare he rode on. He en∣tertain'd
him as his Page eight Years, and
afterwards let him keep Horses in my
Lord's Grounds, by which I think he en∣rich'd
himself <HI>2000 l.</HI> but he never sat at
Table with my Lord 'till he had marry'd
his Daughter, and then gave him to the
Value of <HI>7000 l.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Skipwith</HI> was sent from <HI>Ireland</HI> to be
my Lady's Page; and that his Father and

and he gave him at one Time <HI>1000 l.</HI>
and hath made divers Deeds of Land unto
him.</P>
<P>My Lord was at first a Protestant; but
after, by buying of <HI>Founthill,</HI> he turn'd his
Religion.</P>
<P>That <HI>Henry Skipwith</HI> had no Means when
he came to him, and that he had given
him <HI>1000 l.</HI> and that <HI>Skipwith</HI> lay with

him she must love <HI>Amptil;</HI> and that if she lay
with any other Man, with his Consent, it was
not her Fault but his; and that if it was his
Will to have it so, she must obey, and do it.</P>
<P>That he attempted to draw her to lie
with his Servant <HI>Skipwith;</HI> and that <HI>Skip∣with</HI>
made him believe he did it, but did it
not.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19"/>
That he would make <HI>Skipwith</HI> come na∣ked
into his Chamber, and delighted in
calling up his Servants to shew their Privi∣ties,

those that had the largest.</P>
<P>That one Night, being a Bed with her
at <HI>Founthill,</HI> he call'd for his Man <HI>Brodway,</HI>
and commanded him to lie at his Bed's-Feet;
and about Midnight (she being asleep)
call'd him to light a Pipe of Tobacco;
<HI>Brodway</HI> rose in his Shirt, and my Lord
pull'd him into Bed to him and her, and
made him lie next to her; and <HI>Brodway</HI> lay
with her, and knew her carnally, whilst
she made Resistance, and the Lord held
both her Hands, and one of her Legs the
while; and that as soon as she was free, she
would have kill'd herself with a Knife,
but that <HI>Brodway</HI> forceably took the Knife
from her, and broke it; and before that
Act of <HI>Brodway</HI> she had never done it.</P>
<P>That he delighted to see the Act done;
and made <HI>Skipwith</HI> to come into Bed with
them, and lie with her whilst he might see
it, and she cry'd out to have sav'd herself.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Lawrence Fitz-Patrick</HI> was produc'd,
but before his Examination was read, the Earl
desir'd that neither he, nor any other, might be
allow'd Witnesses against him, until he had ta∣ken
the Oath of Allegiance. This was refer'd
to the Lords the Judges.</P>

<HEAD>The Examination of Fitz-Patrick was then

twice upon his Person; that <HI>Henry

the young Lady, and that there was Love

between them both before and after; and
that my Lord said, he would rather have a
Boy of his begetting than any others; and
that she was but twelve Years of Age when
he first lay with her, and that he could
not enter her Body without Art; and that
the Lord <HI>Audley</HI> fetch'd Oil to open her
Body, but she cry'd out, and he could not
enter; and then the Earl appointed Oil
the second Time, and then <HI>Skipwith</HI> enter'd
her Body, and knew her carnally; and

but she would not lie with <HI>Pawlet;</HI>
he sollicited her also to lie with one

<P><PB N="22" REF="23"/>
That the Earl himself saw her and <HI>Skip∣with</HI>
lie together divers times; and Nine
Servants of the House had also seen it.</P>
<P>When the Earl solicited her first, he
said, that upon his Knowledge her Husband
lov'd her not; and threaten'd that he would
turn her out of Doors, if she did not lie
with <HI>Skipwith;</HI> and that if she did not, he
would tell her Husband she did.</P>

Tobacco; and as he brought it in his Shirt,
he caught hold of him, and bid him come
to Bed, which he refus'd; but to satisfy
my Lord, at last he consented, and came
into the Bed on my Lord's Side; then my
Lord turn'd him upon his Wife, and bid
him lie with her, which he did; and the
Earl held one of her Legs and both her
Hands, and at the last (notwithstanding
her Resistance) lay with her.</P>
<P>That the Earl us'd his Body as the Body
of a Woman, but never pierc'd it, only e∣mitted
between his Thighs.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
He hath seen <HI>Skipwith</HI> lie with the young

that he hath made him the said <HI>Brodway</HI>

<HEAD>The Earl's second Examination.</HEAD>
<P>THE Earl desir'd to be pardon'd of those
Things whereof he must accuse him∣self,
and said, <HI>That Condemnation should not
come out of his own Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>These Testimonies being read, Mr. Attorney
press'd Things very earnestly, and in excellent
Method against the Earl, and said,</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have seen the Clearness of the
Proofs, and I know your Wisdoms to
be such, (as you well know) in so dark a
Business clearer Proofs cannot possibly be
had; for let a Man be never so wicked, or
never so impudent, he will not call Wit∣nesses
to see his Wickedness, yet you see
here this Point fully prov'd.</P>
<P>Then he shew'd how both the Laws of
God and Man be against <HI>Sodomy,</HI> and cited
<HI>Levit. 18.</HI> towards the End, <HI>That by these
Abominations the Land is defil'd; and therefore
the Lord doth visit this Land for the Iniquity
thereof.</HI> And then concludes, that God may
remove and take away from us his Plagues.
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
Let this wicked Man (saith he) be taken
away from amongst us.</P>
<P>Then the Earl <HI>[after the Lord Steward had
told him that he should be heard in his own De∣fence,
with as much Patience as was admitted
in his Charge]</HI> enter'd into his own Defence.
But the Lord Steward advis'd him to speak
pertinently; whereupon he alledg'd, that
he was a weak Man, and of ill Memory,
and therefore desir'd that he might not be
interrupted.</P>
<P>I. Then he began his Defence with Ex∣ceptions
against his Wife, urging, that she
was naught and dishonest with <HI>Brodway,</HI> by
her own Confession.</P>
<P><HI>Whereunto the Lord Steward answer'd,</HI>
That this made against his Lordship; therefore
he ought not to alledge for his Defence that
Fact, as an Imputation to his Wife, which he
forc'd her unto by Compulsion and Violence.</P>
<P>II. Then he objected against the Incom∣petency
of the Witnesses, as the one his
Wife, the other his Servants; and they
drawn to this by his Son's Practice, who
sought his Life; and he desir'd to know, if
there were not a Statute against the In∣competency
of Witnesses?</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>
The Judges resolv'd him, that there was
none touching Witnesses; but in Cases of High
Treason, there was a Statute concerning Ac∣cusers.</P>
<P>III. The he desir'd to be resolv'd, whe∣ther,
because <HI>Brodway</HI> doth not depose any
Penetration, but only that he emitted up∣on
her Belly while the Earl held her, that
should be judg'd Felony as for a Rape?</P>
<P>The Judges resolv'd it to be a Rape, and so
consequently to be Felony.</P>
<P>IV. Then he desir'd to be resolv'd, whe∣ther
his Wife is to be allow'd a competent
Witness against him, or not?</P>
<P>The Judges resolve, that in Civil Cases the
Wife may not; but in a Criminal Cause of this
Nature, where the Wife is the Party griev'd,
and on whom the Crime is committed, she is to
be admitted a Witness against her Husband.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Lord High Steward</HI> desir'd the
<HI>Lords the Judges</HI> to resolve the Questions
which Mr. <HI>Attorney</HI> in his Charge submit∣ted
and referr'd to their Judgments.</P>
<P>1. Whether it were to be accounted <HI>Bug∣gery</HI>
within the Statute, without Penetra∣tion?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28"/>
The Judges resolve, that it was; and that
the Use of the Body, so far as to emit thereupon,
makes it so.</P>
<P>2. Whether, it being prov'd that the
Party ravish'd were of evil Fame, and of
an unchast Life, it will amount to a Rape?</P>
<P>The Judges resolve it to be a Rape, though
committed on the Body of a common Strumpet;
for it is the Inforcing against the Will which
makes the Rape; and a common Whore may be
ravish'd against her Will, and it is Felony to do it.</P>
<P>3. Whether it is adjudg'd a Rape, when
the Woman complaineth not presently?
And whether there be a Necessity of Accu∣sation
within a convenient Time, as with∣in
24 Hours?</P>
<P>The Judges resolve, That in as much as she
was forc'd against her Will, and then shew'd
her Dislike, she was not limited to any Time for
her Complaint; and that in an Indictment,
there is no Limitation of Time, but in an Ap∣peal
there is.</P>
<P>4. Whether Men of no Worth shall be al∣low'd
sufficient Proofs against a Baron or
not?</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29"/>
The Judges resolve, that any Man is a suffi∣cient
Witness in Case of Felony.</P>
<P>Then the Lord Steward spake, and said,</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have been graciously dealt with in
this Proceeding; for it is not an usual
Thing in so capital and heinous Causes as this,
to bring the Party and Witnesses Face to Face
before Tryal; but [my Lord] you have long
before this Time heard their Examinations, and
question'd and oppos'd them Face to Face; and
are thereby the better enabled to make your De∣fence;
and his Majesty is still graciously pleas'd
to continue his Goodness towards you, and hath
commanded that you should be heard at full: If
therefore you have any Thing else to say for
your self, speak it.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Earl answer'd (having first
made a solemn Protestation of his Innocency,
but nevertheless implor'd the Mercy of God
and the King.)</P>
<P>THat he had nothing more to say, but
left himself to God and his Peers, and
then presented to their Considerations three
<HI>Woes.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Woe</HI> to that Man, whose Wife should
be a Witness against him!</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="29" REF="30"/>
2. <HI>Woe</HI> to that Man, whose Son should
persecute him, and conspire his Death!</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Woe</HI> to that Man, whose Servants
should be allow'd Witnesses to take a∣way
his Life!</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And he willed the Lords to take this in∣to
their Consideration; for it might be some
of their Cases, or the Case of any Gentle∣man
of Worth, that keeps a Footman, or
other, whose Wife is weary of her Hus∣band,
or his Son arriv'd to full Age, that
would draw his Servants to conspire his
Father's Death.</P>
<P>He said farther, his Wife had been naught
in his Absence, and had a Child, which
he conceal'd to save her Honour.</P>
<P>That his Son was now become 21 Years
old, and he himself old and decay'd; and
the one would have his Lands, and the o∣ther
a young Husband; and therefore, by
the Testimony of them, and their Servants
added to their own, they had plotted and
conspir'd his Destruction and Death,</P>
<P>And then [being thereunto requir'd by
the Lord Steward] he withdrew himself
from the Bar.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Then the Lord Steward [after solemn
Proclamation of Silence] address'd himself
to the Lords, and said,</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords the Peers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur Lordships have heard the Proofs, the
Prisoner's Defence, all his Doubts and
Questions resolv'd by the Lords the Judges; and
therefore your Lordships [if you please] may
withdraw your selves, if you are satisfy'd; be∣cause
the Prisoner is not call'd to the Bar again
until your Lordships are agreed upon the Verdict.</P>
<P>Then the Peers withdrew themselves;
and after two Hours Debate, and several
Advices and Conferences with the Lord
Chief Justice, whom they sent for, and con∣sulted
with four several Times; having in
that Time also sent the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI>
and Viscount <HI>Dorchester,</HI> together with the
Lord Chief Justice, to consult with the
Lord Steward; at the last they return'd to
their Places; and then the Lord Steward
ask'd them one by one, beginning at the
lowest, and so ascending.</P>
<P>1. Whether the Earl of <HI>Castlehave</HI> was
guilty of the <HI>Rape</HI> whereof he stood in∣dicted,
or not? And they all gave him
guilty.</P>
<P>2. Whether the said Earl of <HI>Castlehaven</HI>
was guilty of the <HI>Sodomy</HI> with which he was
charg'd, or not? And fifteen of the Lords
condemn'd him, and the other eleven freed
him.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32"/>
When the Verdict was thus given, the
Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower</HI> was again com∣manded
to bring the Prisoner to the Bar, to
hear his Sentence; and after he was brought,
the Lord Steward said unto him:</P>
<P>“Forasmuch as thou, <HI>Mervin,</HI> Lord <HI>Aud∣ley,</HI>
Earl of <HI>Castlehaven,</HI> hast been indicted
for divers Felonies, by three several In∣dictments;
one for a <HI>Rape,</HI> the other two
for <HI>Sodomy,</HI> and hast pleaded <HI>not guilty</HI>
to them all, and for thy Tryal hast put
thy self upon God and thy Peers; which
Tryal thou hast had, and they found
thee guilty of them all: What canst thou
say for thy self, why the Sentence of
Death should not be pronounc'd against
thee?” Whereunto he answer'd, He could
say no more, but referr'd himself to God
and the King's Mercy.</P>
<P>Then the Lord Steward said, “My Heart
grieveth for that which my Tongue must
utter; but Justice is the Way to cut off
Wickedness, and therefore hear thy Sen∣tence.”</P>
<P>THOU must go from hence to the Prison
from whence thou camest, and from thence
to the Place of Execution, there to be hang'd by
the Neck 'till thou be dead, and the Lord have
Mercy on thy Soul.</P>

<HEAD>The Lord Steward's Exhortation.</HEAD>
<P>“OH think upon your Offences! which
are so heinous and so horrible, that
a Christian Man ought scarce to name
them, and such as the deprav'd Nature
of Man [which of it self-carries a Man
to all Sin] abhorreth! And you have
not only offended against Nature, but
the Rage of a Man's Jealousy! And al∣tho'
you die not for that, that you have
abus'd your own Daughter! And having
both Honour and Fortune to leave be∣hind
you, you would have had the im∣pious
and spurious Off-spring of a Harlot
to inherit! Both these are horrid Crimes.
But, my Lord, it grieves me to see you
stand out against the Truth so apparent;
and therefore I will conclude with this
Admonition, That God might have ta∣ken
you away when your were blinded
in your Sins, and therefore hope he hath
reserv'd you as a Subject of his Mercy;
and as he sends you to see this Day of
Shame, that you may return unto him,
so thereby in a Manner he lovingly
draws you to him; therefore spend the
Remainder of your Time in <HI>Tears</HI> and
<HI>Repentance;</HI> and this Day's Work, I hope,
will be a Correction from many Crimes
and Corruptions.”</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="34"/>
Whereupon, at last, the Earl descended
to a low Petition to the Lords, and very
humbly be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought them to interced with
his <HI>Majesty</HI> that he might not die, but be
banish'd; or, at least, that his <HI>Majesty</HI>
would not suddenly cut him off, but give
him Time of Repentance. And then he
desir'd their Lordships Pardons, in that he

Nobility.</P>
<P>Then a Proclamation being made by a

open'd mine Eyes to see my Sins against him.
<HI>Dear Sisters,</HI> the Shortness of my Time is such,
that I cannot particularly write to you all; but
knew ye all, to your Comforts, the great and
infinite Favour that the blessed Trinity, Three
Persons and One God, hath bestow'd upon me,
through the Sufferings of my Saviour Jesus
Christ, upon whose Merits and Supplications I
wholly build, and find a Rock of Faith to cleave
unto. In my whole Life, (I thank God) in all
my Sins, which were infinite before the Divine
Majesty, I never took so much Comfort, as I
do in this which the World calls Misery and
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
Affliction. For when I have drawn my Cogita∣tions
together, by what Means I should scorn
and contemn the World, I can think upon none
but this present Blessing bestow'd upon me. God
hath given me Tears with <HI>Peter,</HI> and I doubt
not but, by the Assurance of the most glorious
Spirit, shortly to be where that blessed Man had
his Tears remune<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated with Salvation. The God
of Heaven bless you all, and send you his Holy
Spirit, that you may turn to him, and serve
him with true, contrite, and sorrowful Hearts;
so shall you, at the End of your tedious Jour∣ney,
find a happy Repose with the great Lord of
Lords, that hath bestow'd this Blessing upon your
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st unfortunate Brother. I thank Almigh∣ty
God, that from the first of my Troubles I
laid my self and all earthly Things at the Feet
of the Giver, and have not [blessed be his holy
Name] repin'd at any Thing that it has pleas'd
him to lay upon me; but I have gone on chear∣fully
and humbly, [God be blessed.] And I pray
God bless you all. Pray for me; for you know
the Devil will be busy. God send your Souls to
have the Vision of my Saviour.</P>

<P><HI>Thursday</HI> the 14th of <HI>May 1631,</HI> was ap∣pointed
for the Earl's Execution, who [al∣tho'
fentenc'd to be hang'd, yet, by Rea∣son
of his noble Extraction and the King's
Favour, was permitted to be beheaded] a∣bout
Nine of the Clock in the Morning, at∣tended
by the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower▪</HI> Dr.
<HI>Winniff,</HI> Dean of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, and Dr. <HI>Wick∣ham,</HI>
the King's Chaplain, the Warders of
the <HI>Tower,</HI> and twelve of his own Men car∣rying
a black Velvet Coffin before him, he
ascended the Scaffold on <HI>Tower-hill,</HI> and there
tarry'd half an Hour in private Conference
with the Doctors; and after pulling off his
Hat, and bowing himself to the People, he
said, <HI>I know that [being brought to this Place
where I am to end the Remainder of my ill-spent
Days] all here present do expect that I should
here say somewhat; but, in Regard of my Age,
and the Weakness of my Memory, caus'd by this
my long Affliction of Imprisonment, I hope you
will excuse me from making any long Speech;
therefore what I shall speak, shall be but in brief.</HI>
And then with a bold Courage and loud
Voice he said,</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40"/>
“I do confess that God Almighty hath
been a most gracious God unto me, in
bestowing upon me many and great Bles∣sings,
which have been most wickedly
abus'd by me. He hath given me Titles,
nay, he hath given me Honour too; but,
with Sorrow I speak it, I have not made
that good Use of them, that I should
and might have done, for which I most
earnestly ask Pardon at his gracious
Hands.”</P>
<P>“The King's Majesty, my Sovereign,
hath likewise shew'd very much and
great Favour towards me, in giving me
an honourable Tryal by my Peers, in
giving me a long and large Time of Re∣pentance;
in which Time, I hope, by
my true Humiliation and Sorrow for my
Sins, I have made my Reconciliation
with God; as also, which is not the least,
for which I most heartily thank his Ma∣jesty,
that he hath sent me these two
Doctors, worthy Divines, for the instruct∣ing
and comforting me for the Good of
my Soul, of whom I have receiv'd the
Sacrament three Times. I beseech Al∣mighty
God to bless his Majesty, his
Royal Queen, and hopeful Issue Prince
<HI>Charles;</HI> and grant that there may never
lack one of his Royal Race to succeed
him in these Kingdoms.”</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41"/>
“I do confess, that my Sins have been
many and great, and such as have de∣serv'd
Death; but for these two great
Crimes laid to my Charge amongst the
rest, I call God to witness, [in whose
Presence I now stand] I am innocent
from them, and not guilty of them. Yet
nevertheless, I confess, I have deserv'd
Death, and to that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd I am brought
hither, which God in his Mercy enable
me to undergo. And whereas, at my
Tryal, there was some Questions made
of my Religion; I do confess that herein
I have been too negligent, and have too
much externally favour'd P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pery and
Superstition; but, in my Judgment and
Opinion, I have always held the Pro∣testant
Religion, and the Tenets of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> howsoever outward∣ly
I have too much favour'd Popery;
which God of his infinite Mercy, for his
Son my Saviour's Sake, pardon and for∣give
me.”</P>
<P>Then he held out a Piece of Paper, and
said, “I have here with my own Hand
set down the Articles which I have al∣ways
believ'd, and will now die in;
which, by Reason of the Weakness of
my Sight I am not able to read myself,
therefore I desire that they may be read.”
And then they were openly read with a
loud Voice, [being the same Articles afore∣said
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
which he sent to his Son.] After
which, he said, “I have nothing more
to say, but to intreat all these good Peo∣ple
here, and all the World, to forgive
me; for I do forgive all the World. And
as for those who were the Cause of my
bringing hither, I do as heartily forgive
them,” as I do desire God to forgive me.</P>
<P>Then he bow'd himself, and went to the
Middle of the Scaffold, kneeling down,
and lifting up his Hands and Eyes to Hea∣ven,
[each Doctor kneeling on either Side
of him] he pray'd to God; which Prayer
being ended, [after some Conference with
the Doctors, and with divers on the Scaf∣fold]
with a smiling Countenance he took
his Leave of all Men, and desir'd their
Prayers to Almighty God for him; and
then he prepar'd himself to die, pulling off
his Hat, Band, and Doublet; and then ty∣ing
a Handkerchief about his Face, most
willingly and patiently laid down his Bo∣dy,
submitting himself to the Power of the
Executioner, who with one small Blow se∣ver'd
his Head from his Body, which was
receiv'd by his Servants in a Scarlet Cloth,
and put into a red Silk Bag, and, with his
Body put into his Coffin, and so carry'd in∣to
the <HI>Tower,</HI> where it was bury'd in a
Grave, which he himself saw made for
him in the Morning.</P>

<HEAD>The TRYAL, Conviction, Con∣demnation,
Confession and Execution
of L. Fitz-Patrick and T. Brodway,
two Servants of the late Earl of Ca∣stlehaven.
Together with the Coun∣tess's
Examination at the King's Bench
Bar.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N <HI>Monday</HI> the 27th of <HI>June,
1631,</HI> the Marshal of the
King's Bench brought <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI>
and <HI>Brodway</HI> to the
Bar, where was a Jury of suf∣ficient
and able <HI>Wiltshire</HI> Men,
impanell'd to go upon and try them.</P>
<P><HI>The Countess of</HI> Castlehaven <HI>herself was in
Court, to give Evidence against</HI> Brodway;
<HI>and she came in upon the Instant, when the
Lord Chief Justice demanded of her, whe∣ther
the Evidence she had formerly given
at her Lord's Arraignment were true, and
the full Matter of Charge she had then to
deliver against the Prisoner? Whereunto
<PB N="43" REF="44"/>
she answer'd it was. My Lord said,</HI> Ma∣dam,
You have sworn that <HI>Brodway,</HI> Prisoner
at the Bar, hath lain with you by Force, which may
be, and yet no Act committed; Did he enter your
Body? <HI>She said,</HI> That in her former Oath ta∣ken,
when she testify<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d he lay with her by Force,
her Meaning was that he had known her carnal∣ly,
and that he did enter her Body. <HI>Then was
she wished to look on the Prisoner; unto
which Motion and Commandment she
made a short Reply,</HI> That although she could
not look on him, but with a Kind of Indignati∣on,
and with Shame, in regard of that which
had been offer'd unto her, and she suffer'd by
him, yet she had so much Charity in her, and
such Respect to God and his Truth, that she
had deliver'd nothing for Malice, and therefore
hop'd that her Oath and Evidence thereupon
should be credited; <HI>and so desir'd to be belie∣ved
and dismiss'd; which being granted, she
departed with as much Privacy as might
be into her Coach.</HI></P>
<P>Fitz-Patrick <HI>being ask'd concerning his
Guiltiness or Innocency, demanded who
were his Accusers. The Lord Chief Justice
answer'd, you have accus'd yourself suffi∣ciently.</HI>
Fitz-Patrick <HI>reply'd,</HI> That he
thought neither the Laws of the Kingdom re∣quir'd,
nor was he bound to be the Destruction of
himself; what Evidence he had formerly given,
was for the King against the Earl, and no
farther.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45"/>
<HI>The Lord Chief-Justice reply'd,</HI> It was
true, the Law did not oblige any Man to be his
own Accuser; yet where his Testimony serv'd to
take away any one's Life, and made himself
guilty of the same Crime, therein it should serve
to cut him off also.</P>
<P>Then the Jury demanded of the Court Sa∣tisfaction
concerning the Words of the Sta∣tute,
which run, <HI>to charge him alone to be,
and accounted a Felon in Law, that committed
a</HI> Buggery <HI>with Man or Beast.</HI> [For which
Fact the late Earl was only guilty, and had
suffer'd.]</P>
<P><HI>The Lord Chief Justice reply'd,</HI> That for∣asmuch
as every Accessary to a Felony is a Felon
in Law; so he being a voluntary Prostitute,
when he was not only of Understanding and
Years to know the Heinousness of the Sin, but
also of Strength to have withstood his Lord,
he therefore was so far forth guilty.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Jury found the Bill, and
the Sentence of Death was pass'd on them
both; and they were deliver'd and commit∣ted
to the Sheriff of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> who, after
he had suffer'd them to have some Repast
at Mr. <HI>Hill</HI>'s in the <HI>Palace-Yard,</HI> and Confe∣rence
with their Friends, carry'd them to
<HI>Newgate,</HI> where they behav'd themselves
civilly and religiously.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the 6th of <HI>July,</HI> they were
brought to <HI>Tyburn</HI> in two several Carts,
<HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI> first, and set under the Beam
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
towards <HI>Padington,</HI> appropriated [as is said]
to, and chosen by <HI>Romanists;</HI> where, when
the Executiour had ty'd the Halter about
his Neck, he thus deliver'd himself:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“FOrasmuch as I am here, and, as it
were, upon the Instant to suffer
Death, I desire all loving Subjects and
Members of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to
pray for me. <HI>[When no Man, for any
thing could be perceiv'd, rejoicing at that
Motion, or signifying a Willingness so to do,
he proceeded to a kind of Prayer to our Savi∣our,
his Mother, and the Saints; in which
he was presently interrupted by some Gentle∣men
standing on that North Side, who told
him, that the Beginning of his Prayer was
good, for that he offer'd it to</HI> Christ Jesus,
<HI>in whom only Salvation is to be found; as
for the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>and the Saints, they
could do him no good. But notwithstanding
that, he persisted, saying,]</HI> O yes, the Bles∣sed
Virgin never forsook or fail'd any
that trusted in or call'd upon her; and
therefore he would depend upon her and
the rest of the Saints; <HI>and so proceeded
to an Exhortation to Mr.</HI> Brodway, to
cleave to the same Opinion, and die in
the <HI>Romish</HI> Faith; for which to have
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
him do, <HI>he said,</HI> if he had it, he would
give the whole World. <HI>Unto which Mo∣tion</HI>
Brodway <HI>gave no Answer, or seem'd not
to regard it. Then he proceeded with Relati∣on
how</HI> he had been examin'd by my
Lord Chief-Justice, touching the Corrupt∣ness
of my Lord of <HI>Castlehaven</HI>'s Life,
wherein he no ways confess'd any thing
to prejudice the said Earl.”</P>
<P>“That being within three Days after
sent for before the Lords of the Council,
my Lord <HI>Dorset</HI> [against whom he did
once or twice envy, yet freely forgave
him] had intrapp'd and ensnar'd him to
his Destruction; for that saying upon
his Honour, and speaking it in the Plu∣ral
Number [as the Mouth of the whole
Board] that whatsoever he deliver'd
should no ways prejudice himself; he
thereby got him to declare the Earl
guilty of the Sin of Buggery; wherein
himself being a Party, was the only
Cause he came now to suffer Death; for
which his Lordship's Skill and Policy in
sifting him, together with Dispensation
of his Promise and Oath, he freely for∣gave
him; saying farther, the said Lord
had done him no Wrong, because he
therein was but an Instrument to send
him out of this World into a better.
Then he proceeded to a Kind of a De∣mand
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
of the Company, or rather a Re∣hearsal
of the Earl's denying the Sin at
his Death; touching which he desir'd
and wish'd my Lord had not so spoken,
[if he did] for it was too true; his Lord∣ship
had both bugger'd him, and he his
Lordship. That it was true [for some
private Discontentment] he bore a little
Malice to the Earl and <HI>Skipwith,</HI> for
which he ask'd God Forgiveness. That
<HI>Brodway,</HI> if he had done any Thing to
the Countess, he did it not out of his
own ill or corrupt Nature, but was pro∣vok'd
and perswaded to it by the Earl.”</P>
<P>“He clear'd the young Lord, as never
being any Occasion or Means of his Fa∣ther's
Death, in hiring or persuading
him to give Evidence, as he had done.
He confess'd he had liv'd an ill Life, in
that he had delighted in Drinking, Who∣ring,
and all manner of Uncleanness;
but now, as he was heartily sorry, so he
doubted not of Mercy of Almighty God,
to pardon and forgive him all his Sins,
through and for the Merits and Media∣tion-Sake
of <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> the Blessed Vir∣gin,
and the Saints in Heaven.”</P>
<P>“That he had fallen or run into these
erroneous Sins, and especially that which
he came to die for, in Regard and by
Reason he had neglected, and not so du∣ly,
as he should have done, repair'd to his
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
Ghostly Father, to make Confession, and
take Instructions from him. That after
he did make Confession, and his Sins
known to the Priest, he was not only
sorry for them, but also resolv'd never
to come into my Lord's House again;
yet true it was he did; but it was thro'
Frailty, and because he was not furni∣shed
of another Place.”</P>
<P>So turning again to Mr. <HI>Brodway,</HI> and
persuading him to embrace the <HI>Romish</HI> Faith,
wherein, as he perceiv'd his Labour was in
vain, so the Sheriff and other Persons of
Quality willed him to forbear, and shut up
his Discourse, unless he had any thing
more to say to the Purpose. Whereupon,
praying for the King, Queen and State, he
betook himself to private Prayer, and
therein for the most part continu'd to his
Death.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Brodway</HI> came, [and as it was thought
by the Company, a true Penitent] and af∣ter
fetching a deep Sigh at the Sight of the
Tree, he lifted up his Eyes and Hands to∣wards
Heaven, making and saying to him∣self
two short Prayers; so attending <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI>'s
Discourse, he sate in private Medi∣tation,
often making it manifest he was in
Prayer most of the Time, and also rejoy∣cing
at the Assembly's well wishing of him,
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
for which he return'd (tho feign'd) Smiles
and Thanks. His Time being come to
to stand up, and have the Halter put about
his Neck, and so to declare himself, he wil∣lingly
suffer'd the one, and proceeded to
the other. First asking <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI> if he
had done, he pull'd a Sheet of Paper out of
his Pocket; which being writ broadways,
he could not spread it to read, therefore de∣sir'd
to have his Hands unty'd, which was
done, and he read it distinctly to the As∣sembly;
the Effect whereof, was, to de∣clare
himself guilty, in the Sight of Al∣mighty
God, of Death and Damnation;
for that he had broke all the Command∣ments,
in Thought, Word, and Deed, and
sinn'd in Pride of Life, Lust of the Eye,
Conceit of his own Beauty, matchless
Strength, and other natural Gifts, in De∣sire
of Revenge, not pitying the Poor, un∣lawful
Riches, not repairing to Sermons,
not observing the Sabbath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For all
which and other his Sins whatsoever, he
both desir'd of, and trusted in God for Par∣don,
and that through and for the only
Merits of our Saviour <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> his bit∣ter
Death and Passion. He express'd a
strong Assurance, which his very Soul had,
of Forgiveness, in that, through the As∣sistance
of the Holy Ghost, he had laid
such Hold on Christ as he had done.
This Paper-writing contain'd his Confession
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
and Prayer; also [as I remember] some∣thing
of his slender Guiltiness and Desert
of Death, but not so much. Then deli∣vering
that to the Sheriff, he open'd a lit∣tle
Book, entitled, <HI>Learn to die,</HI> and desir'd
the Company to join with him; so reading
over three short Prayers, the last whereof
was compos'd only of Confession, and for
Pardon, which Prayer he pronounc'd with
great Comfort, at every <HI>Amen</HI> clapping
himself on the Breast; he clos'd it up, and
gave it to his ghostly Father, a Minister
and Kinsman of his, who came along with
him on Horseback close by the Cart. Then
he pull'd out a little Paper, which contain'd
an excellent Prayer of his own making;
and when he had read, and every one join'd
with him in the <HI>Amen,</HI> he commended it
also to the Sheriff; and then throwing a∣way
his Posie of Flowers, he rous'd up him∣self,
and said to this Effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough true it is, what I formerly have de∣liver'd
touching my Guiltiness and Desert
of Death, my Meaning was, and is, only in
Respect of my Sins towards God, and no far∣ther
for Breach of the Laws of the Kingdom,
than only lying once with the Lady <HI>Castlehaven,</HI>
through Perswas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of the Earl, who was then
in Bed with her, and using some small Force
for the Purpose, wherein and by he did emit,
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
but not penetrate her Body. He said, that he
came not to my Lord with a Desire or Intent
any Ways to serve him, but was rather inclin'd
for the Sea, only Mr. <HI>Skipwith</HI> had drawn him
thither for Society's Sake; where not hearing
from his Friends concerning his intended Voyage,
and being more kindly respected by the Earl than
he look'd for, he stay'd from Week to Week,
and Month to Month, contrary to his Inten∣tion.
Then my Lord, making him his Bed∣fellow,
did one Day, when <HI>Skipwith</HI> was with
him in the Garden, [but walking somewhat a∣part]
break out in Speeches to him to this Pur∣pose:
<HI>Brodway,</HI> thou art young, lusty, and
well-favour'd, and therefore can't but prevail
with any Woman thou attemptest; wherefore for
that I am old, and cannot live long, my Wife
wholly delighting in Lust, which I am neither
able nor willing to satisfy, thou may'st do well
to lie with her; and so pleasing her, after my
Death marry her, and thereby raise thy For∣tune.
That <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI> knew my Lord had
solicited him again and again, as hearing him
in that Language when they have been in Bed
together, and he lying at the Bed's Feet. <HI>Which
to clear,</HI> he charg'd <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI> to speak his
Knowledge; <HI>who reply'd,</HI> 'Twas true. <HI>Then
he was ask'd by one of the Lords,</HI> Whether,
when my Lord solicited him, my Lady desir'd to
have him know her carnally? <HI>To which he
said,</HI> No, he would not wrong her, though she
bated him infinitely. But, <HI>said he,</HI> I know
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
well, if I were minded and able to proffer, she
would not say nay, for that Mr. <HI>Skipwith</HI> and
<HI>Amptill</HI> lay with her commonly.</P>
<P>That <HI>Skipwith</HI> confessed to him, how he had
often known her, and gotten a Child upon her,
which she, like a wicked Woman, had made
away, which was the only and sole Occasion, he
the said <HI>Skipwith</HI> now hated her, and there∣fore
had turn'd to the young Lady <HI>Audley;</HI>
all which he presum'd <HI>Skipwith</HI> would confess
upon his Oath. That the Countess was the
wickedest Woman in the World, and had more
to answer for, than any Woman that liveth,
as he thought. <HI>At which Word, that Lord
which ask'd him the former Question, said,</HI>
Grow not into a Passion, Mr. <HI>Brodway,</HI> and
speak nothing for Malice. <HI>He answer'd,</HI> God
forbid I should, I am here in Charity with all
living People, and do as freely forgive my Lord
<HI>Castlehaven,</HI> as I do desire God to forgive me;
but what I speak, is true, as I shall presently
answer before him that redeem'd me, and the
Holy Ghost who sanctify'd me: To whom be all
Honour and Glory, now and for evermore▪
<HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then he proceeded farther, and said,</HI> That
my Lord would have had him done it long be∣fore;
for one Night coming to him to his Bed-Side,
he caught him, and bid him come to Bed
to him and his Wife; that thereupon he made to
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
him as if he would; but being got from him, de∣parted
the Chamber, never intending to do so
foul a Deed; and that for the Reasons aforesaid
he hated her of all Women living. Howbeit,
that one Time, satisfying my Lord's Desire, he
came to Bed to them, where [being gratify'd]
Nature provok'd him to a kind of Desire, and
he emitted, but did not enter her Body, as he
hop'd for Salvation; that he never knew any
Woman carnally whilst he lived in my Lord's
House.</P>
<P>That it was not his Intentions to bring to
Light either my Lord's or my Lady's Shame; but
that when he was upon his Oath, he could not
but speak the Truth; his Nature being never
prone to Lying; or if it were in his Youth, the
good Correction of his Parents had wea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d him
from it, saying, that his Mother had often told
him the Old Proverb, <HI>A Lyar is worse than
a Thief;</HI> and he thought he had more Stripes
for that than all Faults else whatsoever, That he
had, as he hoped, spoke nothing of Moment a∣gainst
my Lord at his Arraignment; he could
not now remember every Thing; if he had, he
desir'd Pardon. <HI>And so concluding his Speech,
prepar'd himself for Death, pulling out a
la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d Handkerchief, desir'd the Executioner
to tie it about his Head. Then pulling off
his Garters, and unbuttoning his Doublet,
Mr.</HI> Goodcoale, <HI>the Minister, ask'd him,</HI> If
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
he would not have a <HI>Psalm. He said,</HI> Yes, with
all his Heart. <HI>Then he read the 143d</HI>
Psalm; <HI>which Mr.</HI> Brodway, <HI>pulling up the
Handkerchief, sung very chearfully, ne∣ver
changing Colour at all. The Minister
pesir'd him to make Confession of his Faith;
so he pronounc'd aloud the Belief.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Goodcoale</HI> said, <HI>These are the Articles
of the Christian Faith, according to the</HI> Church
of England, <HI>into which Faith you was baptiz'd;
pray signify whether in that Faith you intend to
die?</HI> He said, <HI>Yes; for there is no other Faith
[as I suppose] in and by which a Man can be
sav'd.</HI> Then he made Request to the She∣riffs,
and those of Kindred there, <HI>That he
might be bury'd in his own Country.</HI> It was
then told him, <HI>That it was granted, and Or∣der
taken to have it so, wherefore he should
now mind his Prayers.</HI> When his Kinsman
ask'd him, <HI>If he had never another Prayer in
his Pocket?</HI> He said, <HI>No.</HI> Then ask'd Mr.
<HI>Goodcoale, If he would say after him?</HI> And
he said, <HI>Yes, with all my Heart; but first he
desir'd the Executioner to tie his Hands again.</HI>
Which being done, Mr. <HI>Goodcoale</HI> said a
short Prayer to recommend his Soul and
Body to Almighty God, in, and for the
Merits of Christ's Death and Passion, so
that he might live and reign with him
for evermore. To which the dying Party,
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
and all the Spectators said, <HI>Amen.</HI> Then
he lifting up his Hands to Heaven, with
these Words, <HI>Lord Jesus receive my Spirit,</HI>
the Cart was drawn away; and some of his
Friends beat him on the Breast to rid him
of his Pain. <HI>Fitz-Patrick</HI> beheld him
hanging; so lifting up his Hands, and
commending himself to God, in Manner
as aforesaid, his Cart was likewise drawn
away.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> He gave me no Account.</P>
<P>Q. Whether did you ever see the Dutchess
and your Master together at any other
Place, but at his own House?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Never.</P>
<P>Q. When you carry'd the Cloths to <HI>Kee∣mer</HI>'s;
did your Master lie at home that
Night or not?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Sometimes he lay at home, and some∣times
he did not; many Times my Master
has been at the Dutchess of <HI>Mazareen</HI>'s,
from four a Clock this Day, 'till twelve
the next.</P>
<P>Q. Repeat it again; for that's mate∣rial?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> My Master has taken his Chair at his
own Back-door, at four a Clock on a <HI>Satur∣day,</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="124"/>
and not come home 'till <HI>Sunday</HI> at
twelve a Clock.</P>
<P>Q. Where has your Master been at that
Time, when he stay'd out all Night.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> At the Dutchess of <HI>Mazareen</HI>'s; and
when he lost his Gold, he has sent home to
me for more Gold.</P>
<P>Q. Did he ever send to you for any
Cloths when he was there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Never.</P>
<P>Q. D'ye know where he was when he
sent to you for Cloths?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, indeed.</P>
<P>Q D'ye know <HI>Nicholas Hosier?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, I know him very well; I saw
him here just now.</P>
<P>Q. Did you know him when he waited
on Sir <HI>John Germaine?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, he succeeded me, and I succeed∣ed
him again.</P>
<P>Q. You was Foot-man when you went
to Sir <HI>John Germaine;</HI> when was that, and
what Year did you leave off your Livery,
and serve him as his Steward?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I can't tell.</P>
<P>Q. He succeeded <HI>Hosier,</HI> and <HI>Hosier</HI> suc∣ceeded
him; pray let it be ask'd him, at
what Time he came into his Master's Ser∣vice,
when he succeeded <HI>Hosier?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 'Twas about the same Time that the
Tryal was here before.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="125"/>
<HI>Q.</HI> How long was it ere <HI>Hosier</HI> return'd
again to serve Sir <HI>John Germaine?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To the best of my Knowledge it was
three Years; for I receiv'd and pay'd Mo∣ney
for my Master, and <HI>Hosier</HI> was away all
that Time; <HI>Hosier</HI> won't deny it, if he
were call'd in.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You say that you succeeded <HI>Hosier</HI> at
the Time when the Tryal was here, how
long before that Time did you return to
your Master's Service?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> About three Weeks before the King
was crown'd, I came to my Master, and
serv'd him three Years, and wore his Li∣very;
and he was pleas'd, after Mr. <HI>Hosier</HI>
went away, to make me lay out his Mo∣ney,
to be Caterer for him, and to keep
his Gold; and, to the best of my Know∣ledge,
'twas three Years before <HI>Nicholas</HI> suc∣ceeded
me again.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How long was it before he came back
again to serve Sir <HI>John Germaine?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Before I saw him in my Master's House,
and that he took my Place from me, 'twas
three Years.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did you not see Mr. <HI>Hosier</HI> in <HI>England</HI>
before that Time that you went out of your
Master's Service?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, I beg your Lordship's Pardon, I
will recollect my Memory; for that as I
have a Soul to be sav'd, now it is come in∣to
my Mind, my Master sent for <HI>Nicholas</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="126"/>
into <HI>Holland</HI> about a Year before <HI>Nicholas</HI>
did come over; my Master told me before
he came, that he would send for <HI>Nicholas</HI>
again, and that I and <HI>Nicholas</HI> should have
the Charge of his House. <HI>Nicholas</HI> came o∣ver,
and we had the Play at our own
House; <HI>Nicholas</HI> staid there some Time, but
he did not like his Business, and so he went
away again, because he could not have all
the Money?</P>
<P>Q. About what time did <HI>Nicholas</HI> come
into <HI>England,</HI> after the Tryal was before
this House?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I can't resolve you.</P>
<P>Q. Had you no Certificate of Leave, or
Discharge, when you left your Master's
Service?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, my Master was so kind, that he
brought me immediately into the Excise,
as soon as I was out of his Service.</P>

at the Cock-pit, at Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s
House where he now dwells; pray recol∣lect
yourself, that you may be positive as
to the Time?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I can't resolve you as to the Year,
'tis so long ago; I believe it is about five
Years ago.</P>
<P>Q. Can you be positive that it is not
more?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To the best of my Knowledge 'twas
about five Years.</P>
<P>Q. Can you be so far certain, that you
can say 'twas not more?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I can't swear it was more; but I be∣lieve
it may be five Year more or less.</P>
<P>Q. You say you saw her two or three
times there, was it all in one Year, near
the same Time or Month, can you reduce
it to any Certainty?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I believe it might be in Summer.</P>
<P>Q. All in one Summer?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, I believe all in one, to the best

<HI>A.</HI> I did not know her before the Tryal
was here▪</P>
<P>Q. Did you know her any Time after
that Tryal, before the Time you saw her
in Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s House?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was not sure that it was she, only
as I had it from Mr. <HI>Keemer.</HI></P>
<P>Q. Then you don't undertake of your
own Knowledge to say that it was she?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I can't swear that 'twas she, but as
Mr. <HI>Keemer</HI> told me, I don't know whether
I should know her now or not, 'tis so long
since I saw her, I believe it is five Years,
if not more.</P>
<P>Q. Did you see her before or after you
saw her at Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s House?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The first Time they told me 'twas
she, I met her in her Coach in the <HI>Pallmall</HI>
with two other Gentlewomen with her, a
little before the Tryal was here: I follow'd
the Coach; and the Dutchess went into
some Lady's House in <HI>Dover-Street,</HI> and
they told me the Dutchess was the first
Woman that went out; this is the first
Time that e'er I saw her, that I know of,

<P><HI>A.</HI> No, he has been here two or three
Times in <HI>England,</HI> since I left my Master.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="129"/>
Q. How long before this Examination
saw you him, or spoke with him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did not see him above these three
Years.</P>
<P>Q. How long before you came hither as
a Witness did you see him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I have not seen him these three Years
'till I came hither to be a Witness, and did
admire to see him here, that a Man that
had got his Bread under his Master should
appear here against him, it is so ungrateful
a Thing.</P>
<P>Q. How came it that you had so much
Curiosity as to follow the Dutchess's Coach?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I had a mind to satisfy my own Hu∣mour.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know how <HI>Nicholas</HI> liv'd since
he was out of his Master's Service?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, I never saw him, nor had any
Account of him at all, nor have seen him
these three Years 'till now.</P>

Vaness</HI> went out of <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, I neither knew when they went,
nor when they came.</P>
<P>Q. Don't you know what Business he
went out of <HI>England</HI> about, the Time you
took his Place?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I know not the Business he went out
of <HI>England</HI> upon.</P>
<P>Q Did he at that Time tell you he
<PB N="131" REF="130"/>
was to get away to hide himself from co∣ming
hither?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, I heard not one Word from
him at the Time of his parting.</P>
<P>Q. What reason had you to say upon
the first Sight of <HI>Hauseur,</HI> that he was un∣grateful
for coming hither?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I should think my self ungrateful to
eat a Gentleman's Bread seven Years, and
to do him all the Spite and Malice I could.</P>
<P>Q. Repeat those Words?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I should think myself very ungrate∣ful
to prosecute, if I should do any Harm
to a Master that I had serv'd so many
Years, I should think myself very ungrate∣ful,
let him think of himself what he plea∣ses.</P>
<P>Q. He added some other Words?</P>

Malice.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> DID you live with the Dutchess of
<HI>Norfolk</HI> for some Years past?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I liv'd with her since the first Week
of the first Tryal, about six, or seven, or
eight years ago.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What Care was there taken about the
Dutchess's Door into the Park?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I generally went out the first in a
Morning; the Door had two Bolts, a Cross-Bar,
and an Iron Chain; besides, these I
unbolted every Morning, and unbarr'd,
when I went out early.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did you ever hear or understand that
<HI>Hauseur</HI> had a Key to that Door?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I never knew any thing of it, nor
know not of what Use it could have been;
for he could not come in 'till the Door was
unbolted.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Say positively, whether ever you
heard that this Man had a Key to that
Door.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I never heard it.</P>
<P>Q. Did you ever see him come in at that
Door?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="159"/>
<HI>Q.</HI> How? Upon what Occasion?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I happen'd to be going out my self,
and to open the Door for him. His Busi∣ness,
I was told by my Lady-Dutchess's
Maid, was, That she had lent Money to a
Man in <HI>Holland,</HI> and she wrote a Letter, to
be carry'd by this Man to her Sister, to get
the Money; and she sent another Letter
by one <HI>Bull,</HI> to carry to <HI>Holland,</HI> to get
the Money, as she told me.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did you let him in?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I unbolted the Door, and let him in.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did you find that this Man us'd to
come freely to the House, at that Door,
by any Key?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, I never knew it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Who did he come to?</P>
<P>A. <HI>To</HI> Susan Barrington.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did you ever see him above Stairs
with her?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, he might come in, and I not
see it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did the Dutchess or Servants say any
thing that he had Leave to come in?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I never examin'd that; because any
Body that had Business, had Leave to come
in, as Tradesmen, and others.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Did they tell you in the House, that
<HI>Hauseur</HI> was at Liberty to come into the
House with a Key?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, never.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Had you ever any Discourse with
<HI>Hauseur?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="160"/>
<HI>A.</HI> I was one Day coming from <HI>Change,</HI>
and met Mr. <HI>L'Estrange,</HI> and this <HI>Hauseur.
L'Estrange</HI> told me that he was ill of the
Gripes. I told him, that the best Thing
for it was Burnt-Claret; and he and I and
<HI>Hauseur</HI> went to a Tavern in <HI>Smithfield:</HI>
And while we were together, <HI>Hauseur</HI> re∣flected
upon his Master, saying, his Master
had us'd him ill, and deserv'd to be ill
us'd. Mr. <HI>L'Estrange</HI> heard these and some
more Words; and Mr. <HI>L'Estrange</HI> told me,
that he spoke to that Purpose, he was re∣solv'd
to be reveng'd of his Master.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What did he say of his Master?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He said, his Master had us'd him very
ill; he had many threatning Words; he
said his Master was an ill Man, and de∣serv'd
to be ill us'd, and the Time would
come when he should repent it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> When did he say these Words?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 'Twas about <HI>Michaelmas</HI> two Years
ago, or a Year ago, I can't tell which.</P>

<P>Q. With whom?</P>
<P>A. <HI>With</HI> Susan Barrington.</P>
<P>Q. What was his Business with her?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> About the Money, as she told me.
He went along with that Woman; she sent
a Letter by him; and she sent Letters by
some other <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> into <HI>Holland,</HI> about
the Money.</P>

<HI>A.</HI> Her Mother dy'd about the 10th of
<HI>January,</HI> and then I saw her all in Tears,
and she went away, after this Account of
her Mother's Death.</P>
<P>Q. When did you see her last?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I have not seen her this Fortnight or
Month, that I know of, that I could di∣stinguish
her from another Woman, except
she had a Mask on.</P>
<P>Q. How long before this Tryal saw you
her?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> About a Fortnight. She gave me an
Account that her Mother dy'd the 10th of
<HI>January,</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>Q. When did she go away?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I did not take Notice of the Time
she went away.</P>
<P>Q. Did you know <HI>Hauseur</HI> at any other
Place but at the Lady-Dutchess's?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Never, but as I have seen him in the
<HI>Park,</HI> and with Mr. <HI>L'Estrange.</HI></P>
<P>Q. Was you never with him at Sir <HI>John
Germaine</HI>'s.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Never.</P>
<P>Q. D'you know Sir <HI>John Germaine?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> After I had liv'd with the Dutchess
some time, I was told by some in the
Street, that that was his Coach, and his
Livery; and that he was the Man that
there was so much Noise about.</P>
<P>Q. Did you never see him in the Dutch∣ess's
House?</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="163"/>
<HI>A.</HI> I never saw him in no Part of my
Lady-Dutchess's House, nor in no A∣partment;
and I am the only Man that
goes up and down Stairs.</P>

Company at any other Place?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P>Q. Did you constantly lie at the Dutch∣ess's

I lay at <HI>Richmond</HI> two or three Nights.</P>
<P>Q. Did you lie constantly there, when
the Dutchess was there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I was sick near a Month, and all that
Time I lay at my Wife's; but most com∣monly
lay at the Dutchess's, since she is
come to <HI>Duke-street</HI> to live.</P>
<P>Q. You say, you us'd to open the Door
in the <HI>Park,</HI> first in the Morning: What
time did you use to open it at?</P>

Morning; there was no certain Hour, but
I generally open'd that Door.</P>
<P>Q. Did you ever know <HI>Hauseur</HI> come in
at any other Door but that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; one wet Day he came in at the
Street-Door, before the Porter, and all the
Servants, and ask'd for the same Woman.</P>
<P>Q. Did he never ask for any other Bo∣dy?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I never heard him ask for any but <HI>Su∣san
Barrington,</HI> for she was his Country-Woman.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="164"/>
Q. If <HI>Nicholas</HI> got in at the <HI>Park</HI>-Door,
could not he get up Stairs?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If he could get in at that Door he
talks of, he could not get into the Dutch∣ess's
Apartment; for there was a Room be∣twixt
that, where the Plate and Jewels
lay, that no Key could open; that if he
could get up two Pair of Stairs, he could
not get in there.</P>
<P>Q. If he had a Key, and got in at any
Door; could not <HI>Susan Barrington,</HI> when he
came in, without any Difficulty, lead him
round the House.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I can't say but she might; but I ne∣ver
saw him but below Stairs with that
Woman, and then he went away without
going up Stairs.</P>
<P>Q. Did you never see him bring any
thing to the House?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P>Q. You nam'd one <HI>L'Estrange,</HI> that you
saw with him at the Tavern; What is he?</P>

those threatning Words against his Ma∣ster?</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="165"/>
<HI>A.</HI> About ten, eeven, or twelve a-Clock
at Noon.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How long ago is it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I can't tell if it be a Year, or two
Years; 'twas a little after <HI>Michaelmas;</HI> but
whether it be one Year or two Years, I
can't tell.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Could not Mr. <HI>L'Estrange</HI> tell?</P>

not tell.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Whose Servant was <HI>Nicholas</HI> then?</P>

not that he heard him say he would study

might be some other Words. That he was

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This <HI>Nicholas</HI> ledg'd two or three

were like Brothers, they lov'd one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>Q. What know you of this Man, this

<HI>Nicholas,</HI> I did not know no other Name he

Design to rob his Master, and that he knew
where his Gold and his Jewels lay, and
had made false-Keys, and would watch his
Opportunity, when his Master was at Play,

<HI>Q.</HI> How long ago is that?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> About eight or nine Years ago, last
<HI>Christmas.</HI> I would not have your Lord∣ships

he was only condemn'd and executed for
changing ten Pounds of his own Money.</P>
<P>Q. What were your Husband's last dying

<P><HI>A.</HI> He desir'd me to send for this Fel∣low,

my House. I sent for him. He came, and
had some Keys in a Drawer, that my Hus∣band
told me he left there. He took two
or three Keys, and put them in his Pocket,
and look'd mightily out of Countenance.</P>
<P>Q. What did your Husband say to you?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He bid me give <HI>Nicholas</HI> the Keys,
and bid him have a Care and keep good
Company.</P>

was executed.</P>
<P>Q. Did you acquaint <HI>Nicholas</HI> with what
your Husband said of him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, an't please your Honours; I on∣ly
told him, my Husband charg'd me to
give him those Keys; but being in Trou∣ble,
and having a great many Enemies, I
talk'd no further with him.</P>

him when he was Foot-man to Sir <HI>John

<P>I Went to serve Mrs. <HI>Pitts,</HI> on <HI>Friday</HI> Mor∣ning;

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Francis Negus sworn, deposeth as followeth.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> I Desire Mr. <HI>Negus</HI> may be ask'd,
whether the Dutchess of <HI>Norfolk</HI>
did not sent some Message by him? The
Words I don't confine him to; but, whe∣ther
the Message sent by him to my Lord-Duke,
was not to this Purpose, That not∣withstanding
the Articles, she desir'd to
know from his Grace, in what Manner
she should live, and that she would be
govern'd by his Directions?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I think it was much about the
Time of the Transaction of these Articles
the Dutchess sent to me. Mr. <HI>Longueville</HI>
was Council for the Duke, and Sir <HI>Thomas
Powys</HI> for the Dutchess. Mr. <HI>Longueville</HI>
took what Care he could; and when they
came to talk of their living seperately, I
took it only to be an Apprehension and
Fear, that my Lord-Duke would confine
the Dutchess to some House. My Lady-Dutchess
sent for me. I waited on her;
and she express'd herself very sensibly of
the Misfortunes of the Duke and herself,
that such Differences should have been be∣tween
them; and she was desirous to let
<PB N="179" REF="178"/>
my Lord-Duke know, and desir'd me that
I would let my Lord-Duke know it, that
she would avoid all Company, that should
give him any Offence; and that she would
not so much as pay a Visit, but where he
liked. I acquainted my Lord-Duke with
something to this Purpose; for she often
said to me, more than once or twice, that
if she happen'd to die before my Lord-Duke,
she would leave him her Estate;
and I know I have said so to my Lord-Duke.</P>
<P>Q. Whether, from that Time, do you
know, that the Duke sent any Message of
Complaint to the Dutchess, to the Place
where she liv'd, that he would have her
live in any other Way?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I know nothing of that Matter.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know whether my Lord-Duke
ever desir'd her to come and live
with him?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I never heard of any such Thing.</P>
<P>Q. Did he ever send to her, to avoid
any Company?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I never heard of any such Thing.</P>
<P>Q. Whether had you any Directions to
attend the Duke, That he would give way
in a Controversy between the Dutchess and
a noble Lord of this House, whether he
would wave his Privilege?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I have great Reason to desire Sir
<HI>Thomas</HI>'s Favour in this Matter; I know
<PB N="180" REF="179"/>
not what he aims at. I was call'd to the
Bar before, to speak the Truth; as to the
Matter of the Privilege, I know not what
he means by it.</P>
<P>Q. I meant it only as an Instance of a
civil Message between the Duke and Dutch∣ess,
owning her as his Wife; and that this
was a Message that bespoke a good Under∣standing
between them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Will you have me to give an Answer
to Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> my Lords? I confess the
Duke did send for me, and ask'd how the
Settlement and Agreement were betwixt
the Duke and the Dutchess, because of this
Matter of the Privilege.</P>
<P>Q. I did not mean that; but only as a
late Instance of the Duke's owning the
Dutchess so far?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> When the Duke sent for me, he
would know, whether by the Agreement,
he was oblig'd to let her have the Privi∣lege?
I said, I understood it so; and tho'
he had no Mind to do it; but as he had
wav'd his Privilege, in the Case of an
Unckle, he would do it for her.</P>
<P>Q. What would have been the Conse∣quence,
if the Duke had not wav'd his
Privilege? Would not that have defended
her from a Suit?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That you may make use of as you
please▪</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="180"/>
Sir <HI>Thomas Powis.</HI> I would only make

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sheweth,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT for putting an End to all Dif∣ferences
between the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI>
your Petitioner's Husband, and your Petiti∣oner,
several Articles of Agreement were
enter'd into, and executed in <HI>April, 1694,</HI>

your Petitioner's late Father, the Earl of

his then desir'd Advantage, and hath fully
enjoy'd the Benefit thereof; That your Pe∣titioner,
about the Time of perfecting the
said Deeds, signify'd to the said Duke by
Mr. <HI>Negus,</HI> that she should always readily

think fit to appoint Notwithstanding
which, and without ever signifying any
Dissatisfaction to or with your Petitioner,
and without any manner of Notice, or
previous Proceeding in the common and
ordinary Course of Justice, and to take from
your Petitioner that legal Tryal in the Ec∣clesiastical
Court, which by the Laws of
this Realm (as she is advis'd) she is entit∣led
unto, did, on the 16th of <HI>February</HI> last,
exhibit a Bill in the House of Peers, enti∣tuled,
<HI>An Act to dissolve the Duke of</HI> Norfolk's

to enable him to marry again,</HI> Upon which
the Proceedings were so very quick, two

<HEAD>THE
Duke of Norfolk's CASE,
WITH
Reasons for passing his BILL.</HEAD>
<P>IF Want eiter of Precedent for a Parlia∣mentary
<HI>Divorce,</HI> before going through
the tedious and ineffectual Methods of <HI>Do∣ctors
<PB N="199" REF="198"/>
Commons,</HI> or of Demonstration of Fact,
have hitherto depriv'd the <HI>Duke of Norfolk</HI>
of that Relief against his Wife's Adultery,
which the <HI>Divine Law</HI> allows; The late
Statute made in the like Case, and the Co∣ming
in of Two, who, while the <HI>Duke</HI>'s
former Bill was depending, had been sent
away to prevent that Discovery which they
now make, cannot but be thought to re∣move
all Objections against an Act of Par∣liament,
not only for the Benefit of the
<HI>Duke,</HI> but of the <HI>Publick,</HI> as a Means to
preserve the Inheritance of so great an <HI>Of∣fice,</HI>
and <HI>Honours,</HI> to Persons of the true
Religion.</P>
<P>And since Bishop <HI>Cozens</HI>'s Argument, in
the Lord <HI>Rosse</HI>'s Case, has made it evident,
that those Canons which govern the Spiri∣tual
Court in this Matter, are but the Re∣mains
of <HI>Popery,</HI> nothing can be now requi∣quisite
to satisfy the most scrupulous of the
<HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> but to set the Duke's
Proof of his Lady's Adultery in a true
Light.</P>
<P>The Reputation which the Dutchess had
maintain'd of Wit and Discretion, made it
difficult for many to believe, that she could
be surpriz'd in the very Act of Adultery,
as had been formerly prov'd. And though
then it appear'd, That one <HI>Henry Keemer</HI>
liv'd with the Dutchess, while she went by
a feign'd Name, at an House hir'd for her
<PB N="200" REF="199"/>
at <HI>Vaux-Hall</HI> by Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s Bro∣ther;
and that <HI>Nicola,</HI> who then liv'd with
Sir <HI>John,</HI> us'd to receive Wood sent from
the Dutchess to Sir <HI>John</HI>'s House by the
Cock-pit; the withdrawing of <HI>Nicola,</HI> and
carrying with him the <HI>Dutch</HI> Maid, equal∣ly
entrusted with the Secret on Sir <HI>John</HI>'s
side, left no Evidence of their constant
Conversation, but <HI>Keemer</HI> since dead, and
<HI>Susannah Barrington,</HI> who had the like Trust
from the Dutchess.</P>
<P><HI>Keemer,</HI> though very unwillingly, some
Years since confess'd his living with the
Dutchess at <HI>Vaux-Hall,</HI> where he pretended
she was obliged to conceal herself for
Debt: And what Share <HI>Susannah</HI> had in
the Secret was unknown, 'till <HI>Nicola</HI> ap∣pear'd.
<HI>Nicola</HI> coming into <HI>England</HI> some
time since, in Expectation of a Service, ex∣press'd
his Readiness to discover what he
knew, and to endeavour to bring with
him the <HI>Dutch</HI> Maid.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eleanor Vaness, <HI>Exam. 22.</HI> Feb. 1699.</NOTE> She proves, that for two Months the
first Summer after the King came for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI> and the Dutchess
lived together as Man and Wife, and were
seen in Bed together by her, Mr. <HI>Bryan,</HI>
and his Wife, Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Sister: and that
<HI>Nicholas Hauseur,</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Valet de Cham∣bre</HI>
used to be assisting to him; as the Dut∣chess's
<PB N="201" REF="200"/>
Woman, <HI>Susannah Barrington,</HI> was to
her, at going to Bed, and rising.</P>
<P>She proves the like Conversation at <HI>Vaux-Hall,</HI>
and the Dutches's Houses at the <HI>Mill-bank,</HI>
'till the Duke's first Bill for a Di∣vorce
was depending; within which Time
<HI>Nicholas Hauseur,</HI> by Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Order, car∣ry'd
away her, and <HI>Susannah Barrington,</HI>
with Intention of going for <HI>Holland,</HI> to
prevent their being examin'd to what they
knew; but the Wind proving contrary,
they could not go 'till the Bill was reject∣ed;
and then Sir <HI>John</HI> fetch'd back <HI>Susan∣nah,</HI>
who was most useful to the Dutchess;
but <HI>Hauseur</HI> went for <HI>Holland</HI> with <HI>Ellen.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nicholas Hauseur.</NOTE> He confirms <HI>Ellen</HI>'s Evidence in every
Particular; and besides the Persons men∣tion'd
by <HI>Ellen,</HI> as privy to Sir <HI>John</HI>'s ly∣ing
with the Dutchess, names Sir <HI>John</HI>'s
Brother <HI>Daniel Nicholas</HI> having been found
very trusty, his Master sent for him to return
to his Service; and gave him the Opportu∣nity
of proving the Continuance of the
same adulterous Conversation at several
Times and Places; from the Summer 1692,
to the 26th of <HI>April 1696.</HI> He swears he
had, after his Return to Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Service,
seen them in Bed together at Sir <HI>John</HI>'s
House, at the <HI>Cock-pit,</HI> and at the Dutchess's
Houses at <HI>Mill-bank,</HI> and where she now
<PB N="202" REF="201"/>
lives; and us'd to be let into the Dutchess's
Apartment by <HI>Susanna Barrington,</HI> or <HI>Kee∣mer.</HI>
Nor can any Man, who shall read the
ample Testimonials given Mr. <HI>Hauseur</HI> by
Sir <HI>John,</HI> (by the last of which it appears,
that he serv'd him faithfully as his Stew∣ard)
reasonably question <HI>Hauseur</HI>'s Cre∣dit.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">William Bayly.</NOTE> Another, who had been advanc'd by
Sir <HI>John</HI> from his Footman to Mr. <HI>Hauseur</HI>'s
Place, and from thence to a good Office in
the Excise, very unwillingly confirm'd
the Testimony of <HI>Hauseur</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Maid; not only as to the Time of their
going from the Service of Sir <HI>John</HI> and the
Dutchess, but tho' being no Foreigner, he
could not so easily be sent away to pre∣vent
Discovery; and therefore was not let
so far into the Secret as <HI>Hauseur</HI> and the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Maid; yet, he swears the Dutchess
us'd to come mask'd to his Master's House;
that he has gone with him as far as the
Horse-Ferry towards her House at the
<HI>Mill-bank;</HI> that then his Master sometimes
<HI>lay out all Night,</HI> and the next Morning he
has <HI>carry'd Linnen and Cloaths</HI> for his Ma∣ster
to <HI>Keemer</HI>'s House, or <HI>Keemer</HI> has fetch'd
them from him; and this he proves to
have been since the rejecting the former
Bill, and about five Years since, when he
<PB N="203" REF="202"/>
was succeeded by <HI>Hauseur,</HI> as before he
had succeeded <HI>Hauseur.</HI></P>
<P>Two other Foreigners, <HI>La Fountaine,</HI>
who had liv'd with Sir <HI>John,</HI> and was
serv'd with Summons at the Dutchess's
House at <HI>Drayton,</HI> and <HI>Hugonee,</HI> who ran
away from the Lord <HI>Haversham</HI>'s, since Sum∣mons
was taken out against him, seem to
have the same Trust that <HI>Hauseur</HI> had; for
both declar'd, that nothing should oblige
them to <HI>betray their Master's Secrets:</HI> One
said, <HI>No Court could dispence with his Oath
of Secrecy;</HI> and both declar'd they would
immediately go beyond-Sea. Summons
have been taken out for Mr. <HI>Brian,</HI> and his
Wife, and Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s Brother (who
are, or lately were in Town) to confess
or deny what <HI>Nichola</HI> and <HI>Ellen</HI> appeal to
them for; and it cannot be imagin'd, that
Sir <HI>John</HI> should chuse the Honour of being
thought to have to do with a Dutchess,
before the clearing her and himself from
the Imputation, by bringing his Relations
to disprove the Charge, if what is sworn
to be within their Knowledge is false.</P>
<P>And if Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Vanity should prevail
within him, at least it is to be presum'd, that
his Relations would be more just to him
and the Lady, than to suffer any thing to
pass against them, which they could in
Truth and Justice prevent.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="203"/>
But since none of them appear, the
World will believe their absenting more
than a Thousand Witnesses, in Confirma∣tion
of what Mr. <HI>Hauseur, Ellen,</HI> and <HI>Bay∣ly</HI>
have sworn. Whose Evidence not only
stands untouch'd by any thing offer'd by
the Dutchess's Witnesses, but is plainly
confirm'd by them in the principal Parts.</P>
<P>This being the Nature of the Proofs,
'tis observable,</P>
<P>1. That there never yet was any Case of
this Kind, where the Evidence was not
liable to greater Objections than can be
made to this.</P>
<P>Tho' in the latest Case of this Kind,
there was full Conviction of the La∣dy's
having Children while she liv'd sepa∣rate
from her Husband, and the Presump∣tion
was very violent whose the Children
were; yet this was but Presumption, and
that was weaken'd by the Presumption in
Law, that they were the Husband's; espe∣cially,
since there was no direct Proof of
the Lover's ever lying with her.</P>
<P>2. Tho' in that Case, by Reason of the
Interval of Parliament, and Fear of the
Deaths of Witnesses, a Suit was begun in
<HI>Doctors Commons,</HI> 'tis taken from thence
while the Suit was depending; therefore,
that was rather an Objection against pro∣ceeding
in Parliament, than an Argument
for it.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="204"/>
3. In that Case, several Witnesses were
examin'd at the Bars of both Houses, who
had not been examin'd at <HI>Doctors Commons,</HI>
nor any Notice given of their Names be∣fore
their Examination.</P>
<P>4. It appears by that Case and the pre∣sent,
that the Examinations in Parliament
are more solemn and certain than those of
the Spiritual Court, which depend too
much upon the Honesty of the <HI>Register,</HI> or
his Deputy.</P>
<P>5. Before that Case, Parliaments have
either broken thro' the Rules which bind
the Spiritual Court, as in the Case of the
Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Eliz n. 31.</NOTE> 1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> where the Par∣liament
ratify'd the Marriage, <HI>as lawful
according to Gods Law; tho' protracted and
letted, by reason of certain Decrees and Can∣nons
of the Popes Law:</HI> Or else have dis∣solv'd
a Marriage where there had been no
Application to <HI>Doctors Commons;</HI> as in the
Case of Mrs. <HI>Wharton,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3. W. M.</NOTE> who had been mar∣ry'd
to Mr. <HI>Cambel;</HI> and yet there had been
no Examination of Witnesses, but what
had been before the two Houses.</P>
<P>So long before, in the Case of Sir <HI>Ralph
Sadler,</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">37. H. 8.</NOTE> upon Proof before the two Hou∣ses
that the Lady <HI>Sadler</HI>'s former Husband
had deserted her, and disappear'd for four
Years before she marry'd Sir <HI>Ralph,</HI> the
<PB N="206" REF="205"/>
Parliament legitimated her Children by
Sir <HI>Ralph.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas some object against the passing
the Bill, as if it would countenance a Ju∣risdiction
in the House of Lords, to exa∣mine
to such Matters, in the first Instance
or originally; the Objection would be the
same, if it had begun, as it might, in the
House of Commons; but in Truth would
be of equal Force against most private, and
several publick Acts, occasion'd by the
Examination of Witnesses, or Notoriety of
Fact.</P>
<P>Since therefore, the Duke has so long,
and so often in vain endeavour'd to be freed
from a Lady, publickly fam'd, and prov'd
to have liv'd with Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI> as
his Wife; the Duke's former Disappoint∣ments
cannot but be powerful Arguments
for his speedy obtaining that Justice which
the Spiritual Court cannot give him, their
Power reaching, no further than to that
Liberty of living, as <HI>she list,</HI> some Years
since settled by Articles: But as none of
less Art and Oratory than her Council
could have turn'd this into a Licence to
commit Adultery, <HI>if she list,</HI> or a Pardon
afterwards; had there not been Evidence
of her Acting according to such Constru∣ction,
the Duke would have hoped she
had repented of the former Injuries he had
receiv'd from her; but now hopes she shall
<PB N="207" REF="206"/>
not longer continue to bear the Name of
his Wife, and put him in Danger of being
succeeded by Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s Issue, or
deprive him of the Expectation of leaving
his Honours, Offices, and Estate, to a Pro∣testant
Heir.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>Bishop COZENS'S
ARGUMENT,
PROVING,
That Adultery works a Dissolution of
Marriage.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being the Substance of several of Bishop
Couzens's Speeches in the House of Lords,
upon the Debate of the lord Ross's
Case.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Taken from Original Papers, writ in the Bi∣shop's
own Hand.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Question is indefinitely to be
spoken of,</HI> Whether a Man being di∣vorc'd
from his Wife, who hath committed
Adultery, and is convicted of it, may marry
<PB N="208" REF="207"/>
himself to another Wife or no, during the Life
of her which is divorc'd.</P>
<P>The Place in St. <HI>Matthew</HI> the 5th, repeat∣ed
again St. <HI>Matthew</HI> the 19th, has great
Perspicuity: If it be not lawful for any
Man to put away his Wife, and marry
again, except it be in the Case of Forni∣cation,
(for the displacing the Words, by
putting the Exception before the Marriage,
cannot alter the Sense,) then, <HI>à contrario,</HI> it
must of Necessity follow, That if the Wife
be put away for Fornication, the Husband,
by the Tenor of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Words, is left free
to marry again; which Freedom is not
allow'd to the Adultress herself, nor any
Man else that shall marry her.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Mark</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI> have been oppos'd
to St. <HI>Matthew;</HI> and it has been said, that
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Words in St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> did not pro∣perly
belong to <HI>Christ</HI>'s Disciples, or the
Christian Church, as the Words in St. <HI>Mark</HI>
and St. <HI>Luke,</HI> which are absolute, do; which
is a Saying that neither I, nor, I think,
no body else ever heard of before; for
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Sermon in the Mount was spoken
to <HI>his Disciples,</HI> and especially belonged to
<HI>Christians.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis clear they are spoken to <HI>his Disci∣ples;</HI>
for he says to them, that they are
<HI>the Salt of the Earth, and the Light of the
World;</HI> and that they are <HI>blessed, when</HI> they
<PB N="209" REF="208"/>
<HI>suffer Persecution for his Name's sake;</HI> which
no Man will say or apply to the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, that in the 9th Chapter of
St. <HI>Matthew, Christ</HI> answers the <HI>Scribes</HI> and
<HI>Pharisees,</HI> who came to tempt him with
their Question, <HI>Whether it was lawful for a
man to put away his wife for any cause,</HI> as
they said <HI>Moses had permitted them to do.</HI>
But the Answer that <HI>Christ</HI> gave them,
That it was not lawful, <HI>but only in case of
adultery, for men to put away their wives, and
marry another,</HI> was a Rule which concern'd
<HI>all Christians</HI> to observe for ever after; and
for that Reason was recorded by St. <HI>Mat∣thew.</HI></P>
<P>The Words in St. <HI>Mark</HI> and St. <HI>Luke,</HI>
are not to be taken absolutely, but to be
supply'd and understood by his Words in
St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> as in many other Cases is
clear, <HI>viz.</HI> The Theif upon the Cross;
Baptism in the Name of the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereof many In∣stances
may be brought, as the Destruction
of <HI>Niniveh, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But for <HI>Christ</HI>'s Words, the Exception
confirms the Rule, and infers a Concession,
that in the Case of <HI>Fornication,</HI> the putting
away one Wife, and marrying another is
allow'd. It is alike with divers other his
Exceptions, which are found in Scripture:
For Brevity, I will instance in this one,
<HI>viz. Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise pe∣rish.</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="209"/>
Upon which Text, if I, or any Bi∣shop
else were to preach; I believe we
should not discharge our Duty, unless we
should tell the People, That if by the
Grace of God they did repent, they should
not perish.</P>
<P>The Exception here, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>nisi,</HI> unless,
is parallel with the <HI>1 Kings 3. 18. None
were in the house, except we twain;</HI> they two
therefore were, others were not.</P>
<P>Such Exceptions proceeding from natu∣ral
Equity, are tacitly imply'd in Laws,
tho' pronounc'd in general Terms.</P>
<P>But as to the Exception here, the Words
are not capable of any other Sense than
as I have observ'd; for except that Re∣straint
be referr'd to Marrying again, the
Sense would run thus, <HI>Whosoever puts away
his Wife commits Adultery;</HI> which stands
not with Truth or Reason; since it is not
the Dismission that is adulterous, but the
Marriage of another. It is, therefore, the
plain Drift of our Saviour, to teach the
<HI>Pharisee,</HI> that the Marriage of a second
Wife, after a Dismission of a former, <HI>upon
any other cause, except for fornication,</HI> is no
less than Adultery; thereby inferring,
That upon a just Dismission for Fornica∣tion,
a second Marriage cannot be bran∣ded
with Adultery.</P>
<P>Besides, the <HI>Pharisee</HI>'s Question <HI>[Is it law∣ful
for a man to put away his wife for every
<PB N="211" REF="210"/>
Cause]</HI> was not without a plain Implication
of Liberty to marry another, which our
Saviour well knowing, gives a full An∣swer,
as well to what he meant, as what
he said; which had not been perfectly sa∣tisfactory,
if he had only determin'd that
one Part concerning Dismission, and not
the other concerning Marriage; which
Clause, if two <HI>Evangelists</HI> express not, yet
it must be fetch'd necessarily from the
third; since it is a sure and irrefragable
Rule, <HI>That all four Evangelists make up one
perfect
Gospel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Rhemists, <HI>and College of</HI> Doway,
<HI>urge for the</HI> Popish <HI>Doctrine,</HI> Rom. 7. 2. The
woman which hath an husband, is bound by the
law to her husband as long as he liveth; <HI>but,</HI></P>
<P>1. This Place is to be expounded by
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Words.</P>
<P>2. St. <HI>Paul</HI> hath no Occasion here to speak
of <HI>Divorce,</HI> but of <HI>Marriage whole and sound,</HI>
as it stands by <HI>God</HI>'s Ordinance.</P>
<P>3. He speaks of a Woman who is under
an Husband; so is not she that is divorc'd
from him.</P>
<P>4. St. <HI>Paul</HI> useth this to his Purpose of
the Law being dead, to which we are not
bound.</P>
<P>Nor is their Doctrine more favour'd by
<HI>1 Cor. 7. 10. Let not the Woman depart;</HI> as
being in her Choice whether she should
depart or not: But in the Case of <HI>Fornica∣tion</HI>
<PB N="212" REF="211"/>
she was to depart, or rather be <HI>put

<P>The Bond of Marriage is to be enquir'd
into, what it properly is; being a Con∣jugal
Promise solemnly made between a
Man and his Wife, That each of them
will live together according to God<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Holy
Ordinance, notwithstanding Poverty or
Infirmity, or such other Things as may
happen during their Lives. Separation
from Bed and Board, which is Part of their
Promise so to live together, doth plainly
break that Part of the Bond whereby they
are ty'd to live together, both as to Bed
and Board. The Distinction betwixt Bed
and Board, and the Bond, is new, never
mention'd in the Scripture, and unknown
in the ancient Church; devis'd only by
the <HI>Canonists</HI> and the <HI>Schoolmen</HI> in the <HI>Latin
Church</HI> (for the <HI>Greek Church</HI> knows it not)
to serve the Pope's Turn the better, 'till
he got it establish'd in the <HI>Council of Trent;</HI>
at which Time, and never before, he laid
his <HI>Anathema</HI> upon all them that were of
another Mind; forbidding all Men to mar∣ry,
and <HI>not to make any Use of Christ's Con∣cession.</HI></P>
<P>Bed and Board, or Cohabitation, belong
to the Essence and Substance of Matrimo∣ny;
which made <HI>Erasmus</HI> and Bishop <HI>Hall</HI>
say, <HI>That the Distinction of those two from
the Bond, is meerly chimerical</HI> and <HI>Fancy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="212"/>
The Promise of Constancy and mutual
Forbearance, if it hinders Divorce as to
the Bond, hinders it also as to Bed and
Board; and because the same Bed, and the
same Table, were promis'd in the Marriage
Contract; but the Promise does not ex∣tend
even to tolerating <HI>Adultery,</HI> or <HI>mali∣cious
Dese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion;</HI> which, according to <HI>God's
Ordinance, dissolves the Marriage.</HI></P>

where the Act manifestly supposes, that
whatever had obtain'd for Law 'till that
Time, was void, as being <HI>contrary to God's
Law.</HI></P>
<P>The most considerable Men of the Re∣form'd
Churches, both at Home and A∣broad,
are of this Opinion: <HI>Grotius</HI> quotes
<PB N="217" REF="216"/>
<HI>Tertullian,</HI> in whose Time, it was lawful
for the innocent Party to marry.</P>
<P><HI>Lancelot Inst. Jur. Can.</HI> acknowledges
that Divorce is a Dissolution of the Mar∣riage.</P>
<P><HI>Selden,</HI> who is not likely to contradict
the Laws of this Kingdom, maintaineth,
That Marriage after Divorce, is to be al∣low'd;
and in that Particular, Dr. <HI>Ham∣mond</HI>
doth not contradict him, but is
clearly for it.</P>
<P>The Opinion of <HI>Amesius</HI> deserves to be
set down at large. “Marriage, says he,
cannot be dissolv'd by Men at their
Pleasure; and for that Reason, as it is
consider'd simply and absolutely, it is
rightly said to be indissolvable; because
Marriage is not only a Civil, but a
Divine Conjunction; and is also of that
Nature, that it cannot be dissolv'd
without Detriment to either Party:
Yet it is not so indissolvable, but it
may be dissolv'd for a Cause which
God approves as just; For the Indis∣solvability
was not instituted for a Pu∣nishment,
but for the Comfort of innocent
Persons; and admits and Exception,
whrein God ceases to conjoyn. By
Adultery, two are made not to remain
one Flesh; hence it is, that a contagi∣ous
Disease is not a Cause of dissolving
Marriage. <HI>By Adultery, the very Essence
<PB N="218" REF="217"/>
of the Contract is directly violated; but the
Contract ceasing, the Bond depending on
the Contract, necessarily ceases.</HI> It is a∣gainst
all Reason, that all Matrimonial
Duties should be for ever taken away,
yet the Bond or Obligation to those
Duties, should continue. The Words of
<HI>our Lord, Matth. 5. 32.</HI> and 19. 9. have
no Distinction or Limitation of the put∣ting
away, but simply and absolutely
approve of putting away; therefore they
approve of putting away, not partial,
or to a particular Purpose, from Bed
and Board, but <HI>total.</HI>”</P>
<P>None are against the Reform'd Divines,
but Dr. <HI>Howson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bunny,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Pri∣deaux.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Howson</HI> was a profess'd Adversary
to Dr. <HI>Reynolds,</HI> who was a great Main∣tainer
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> against
all the Points of Popery, and particularly
in this.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> Bishop <HI>Hall,</HI> Dr. <HI>Fulk,</HI> are
for second Marriages; no Authors against
them, but the <HI>Council of Trent,</HI> and those
of the <HI>Church of Rome;</HI> whose Credit is
only sav'd, by those of our Church who
agree with them.</P>
<P>Upon the Difference of Explication be∣tween
St. <HI>Ambrose, Origen,</HI> and St. <HI>Austin,</HI>
a new Kind of Divorce has been thought
of, <HI>from Bed and Board;</HI> but this <HI>Divorce,</HI>
<PB N="219" REF="218"/>
or <HI>Name of a Divorce,</HI> was unknown to
the <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>Ancient Christians.</HI></P>
<P>I said so much before, at the first and
second Reading of this Bill, that I was
in good Hopes to have had no further
Occasion given me, of answering any
Objections against it now; but seeing di∣vers
new Arguments have been study'd
and fram'd against it, since that Time, I
shall now endeavour to satisfy and clear
them all.</P>
<P>1. The First Argument against it is,
That the Separation from Bed and Board,
doth not dissolve the Bond of Marriage.
To which I must reply, as I did before,
That this is a Distinction without a Dif∣ference;
newly invented by the <HI>Canonists</HI>
and <HI>School-men,</HI> and never heard of either
in the <HI>Old</HI> or <HI>New Testament,</HI> nor in the
Times of the Antient Fathers, who ac∣counted
the Separation from Bed and
Board, to be the Dissolution of the Bond
it self.</P>
<P>2. That first Institution of Marriage,
that they may be <HI>one Flesh,</HI> is by Adul∣tery
dissolv'd, when the Adultress makes
her self <HI>one Flesh</HI> with another Man; and
<HI>thereby dissolves the first Bond of her Mar∣riage.</HI></P>
<P>3. The Objection; That if the Bond be
dissolv'd, and afterwards, if the Man or
<PB N="220" REF="219"/>
Woman be reconcil'd, they must be mar∣ry'd
over again, is no necessary Conse∣quence,
no more than 'tis in a Person
baptiz'd, who may break his Covenant,
and renounce his Baptism; and yet, up∣on
true Repentance, be receiv'd into God's
Favour, by Virtue of the first Covenant,
without a new Baptism. Suppose a Witch,
who, they say, makes a Compact with
the Devil, to renounce her Baptism, should,
afterwards, by the Grace of God, serious∣ly
and truly repent herself of the Wick∣edness,
I do not believe, that any Body
would take upon him to baptize her a∣gain.
And if a Priest should renounce
his Orders, and turn <HI>Turk,</HI> and yet after∣wards
repent him, and return into the
Church, he need not be re-ordain'd a
second Time. The Case will be the same
in Marriage.</P>
<P>4. I said heretofore, That the <HI>Roman</HI>
Doctors allow'd this Dissolution of the
Bond, when the Man and Wife, even af∣ter
the Consummation of Marriage, would
transfer themselves into a Friary, or
Nunnery: But because it hath been since
doubted, that no Authority can be shew'd
for this Particular, I shall here shew it
out of the old Constitutions of the Church
of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="220"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. Will. Lindewode, sive Const. Ang. fol. 94. Vernul. latenus separentur.</NOTE> “And in the Case of Religion, that
is the true Understanding that, to wit,
either of them betaking themselves to
Religion before Carnal Knowledge, the
Bond of the Marriage be dissolv'd; <HI>but
if both enter into Religion, and make solemn
Profession, then such Marriage is dissolv'd,
even as to the Bond.</HI>”</P>
<P>5. It hath also been said, that if the
Bill pass, it will pass against the Church
of <HI>England;</HI> which, I confess, I do not un∣derstand;
for the Church of <HI>England</HI> is
<HI>within the Kingdom of</HI> England; and if
the Laws of this Kingdom be for the Bill,
and have declar'd it by the Assent of the
King, Lords, and Commons, as in the
Case of the Marquis of <HI>Northampton</HI> was
heretofore declar'd, in the Time of King
<HI>Edward</HI> the 6th, <HI>That by the Laws of God,
the Innocent Party was at Liberty to marry
again;</HI> certainly the <HI>Spiritual Lords,</HI> as
well as the <HI>Temporal,</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> are
bound to admit it; <HI>and I know not why
they should be call'd the Church of</HI> England,
<HI>that joyn with the Council of</HI> Trent, <HI>and
plead so much to uphold it, rather than others,
that joyn with all the Reform'd Churches,
and plead against the Canon of the Church
<PB N="222" REF="221"/>
of</HI> Rome, <HI>which hath laid an</HI> Anathema
<HI>upon us, if we do not agree with them.</HI></P>
<P>As to the suppos'd Inconveniencies that
will follow upon marrying again.</P>
<P>1. More Inconveniencies will follow,
if they be forbidden to marry again.</P>
<P>2. The Father would be in an Un∣certainty
of the Children, if he should
retain the Adulteress.</P>
<P>3. There would be Danger of Poison∣ing,
or Killing one another, if no second
Marriage were allow'd.</P>
<P>4. Where the Parties should consent to
new Marriages for their own Lusts, the
Magistrates have Power to over-rule such
Practices.</P>
<P>5. If they be kept altogether by Di∣vorce
from marrying, it would occasion
the Innocent Party to sin.</P>
<P>A little before the main Question, a∣bout
passing the Duke's Bill, the Dutch∣ess's
Agents handed about this Paper,
among such as they thought to be her
Friends.</P>

<P>UPON the Marriage of the Dutchess

<HI>10000 l.</HI> and settl'd on that Marriage,
Lands of near <HI>1000 l. per Annum,</HI> the Re∣mainder

Years, out of the Earl's Estate; besides
very rich Jewels, Plate, and other Things
of great Value, which the Dutchess brought
with her into the Duke's Family: And
great Debts having been contracted, for
the Support of the Duke's Honour and
his Service, while he cohabited with the
Dutchess, she hath, since his Separation
<PB N="224" REF="223"/>
from her, paid them out of her own
Estate.</P>
<P>That by the evil and malicious Insi∣nuations
of the Dutchess's Enemies, the
Duke was prevail'd on to carry her, then
a Protestant, into <HI>France,</HI> and to put her
into a Monastery (where she could not be
admitted without changing her Religion)
and left her there, on great Assurances
of sending for her Home in a short Time,
and so parted with great Expressions of
Kindness.</P>
<P>That a considerable Time after, by the
Dukes Consent, she return'd into <HI>England,</HI>
and liv'd retiredly at <HI>Drayton</HI> in <HI>Nor∣thamptonshire;</HI>
and at the Time of the

privately, 'till her Father obtain'd his
Liberty, when she came Home to him.</P>
<P>That on the 8th of <HI>January, 1691,</HI> the
Duke was prevail'd on, by the instigati∣on

with the Bill now depending, and divers
Witnesses were examin'd on both Sides;
after which, and a long solemn Debate,
and due Consideration had by their Lord∣ships
of the Witnesses, and what was
Sworn by them, the 17th of <HI>February,</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="224"/>

<P>Notwithstanding which, the Duke was

his first; which, after several Debates,
was, the second of <HI>January</HI> following, a∣gain

<P>Some Time after this, and for accom∣modating
all Differences between them,
Proposals were made to the Dutchess,
which, after long Agitation, on the 28th
of <HI>April, 1694,</HI> were reduc'd into Wri∣ting,
and executed by the Duke and Dutch∣ess:
The Preamble of which Articles, is
in the Words following. <HI>Whereas diverse
Controversies, Debates, Demands, and Suits of
several Natures, have for some Time since
been agitated and continu'd, between the said
Duke, and the said Dutchess his Wife,</HI> &amp;c.
<HI>unto all which, it is at last held fitting (it
being conducible to their respective quiets and
ease) to have an End put, and the like for
the future prevented. It is therefore hereby,
and by the Parties to these Presents, declar'd
and agreed in manner following;</HI> whereby
the Dutchess convey'd to the Duke's Use,
the Mannor of <HI>Castle-Rising,</HI> &amp;c. And also
the said Dutchess, and her Trustees, as∣sign'd
their Interest in a considerable Part
of the Mannor of <HI>Sheffield</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> to
<PB N="226" REF="225"/>
the Use of the said Duke. So that by
these Articles, and that Deed executed
thereupon, the Duke had his then desir'd
Advantages.</P>
<P>That after the Execution of these Ar∣ticles,
the Dutchess sent for one Mr. <HI>Negus,</HI>
the Duke's principal Gentleman, and ex∣press'd
her self very sensible of the Mis∣fortunes
of the Duke and her self, and
desir'd Mr. <HI>Negus</HI> to tell the Duke, that
she would avoid all Company that should
give him any Offence; and that she
would not so much as pay a Visit, but
where he lik'd; which Mr. <HI>Negus</HI> lately
testify'd before the Lords, and that he ac∣quainted
the Duke with it; as also that
she had several Times told him, if she
dy'd first, she would leave the Duke her
Estate.</P>
<P>That notwithstanding the said Agree∣ments,
whereby the Duke and and Dutch∣ess
agreed to live separately, yet without
his signifying any Dissatisfaction to or with
the Dutchess, or without any manner of
Notice, or previous Proceeding in the com∣mon
and ordinary Course of Justice, but by
taking from her that legal Tryal in the
Ecclesiastical Court, which by the Laws of
this Realm she is entitled unto, he did, on the
16th of <HI>February</HI> last, exhibit in the House of
Peers the Bill now depending for Dissolving
the Duke's Marriage with the Dutchess, and
<PB N="227" REF="226"/>
for enabling him to marry again. Uponwhich
the Proceedings were so very quick, two
Foreigners <HI>(a</HI> French <HI>Foot-man and a</HI> Dutch-<HI>Cook-Maid)</HI>
lately brought from beyond
Sea, being forthwith examin'd against her,
charging her with Facts suppos'd to be
committed many Years since, and long be∣fore
the Date of the said Agreement, and
on which the two former Bills were foun∣ded,
that it was impossible for her to make
her Defence as she might have done, if the
Proceedings had been against her according
to the known Laws of this Land.</P>
<P>The Dutchess thought herself under a
Necessity of complying with all the Orders
of the House of Peers; and accordingly, as
well as she could, made her Defence, tho'
less than a Week's Time was allow'd her
for doing it; and upon examining the E∣vidence
of the Duke's Witnesses, many
Contradictions appear'd, some whereof fol∣low,
as doth appear by the Depositions ta∣ken
in Writing, and now remaining in the
<HI>House of Peers.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Hauseur</HI> the Footman swears the
Dutchess was at the Cock-pit, when and
before he came to live with Sir <HI>John Ger∣maine,</HI>
and that he continued there fifteen
Days after, and that after the Dutchess left
the Cock-pit she went to <HI>Vaux-Hall.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vaness</HI> the Cook-Maid swears <HI>Hauseur</HI>
came to Sir <HI>John</HI> when the Dutchess was
at <HI>Vaux-Hall.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="227"/>
<HI>Hauseur</HI> swears, that on the 8th of <HI>Feb.
1692,</HI> he left Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Service, when the
Tryal was between the Duke and Dutch∣ess
in Parliament, and after liv'd private∣ly
six or eight Weeks, 'till he and <HI>Vaness</HI>
could get for <HI>Holland,</HI> and arriv'd there in
<HI>Easter</HI> following.</P>
<P>And yet, in another Place, he swore he
desir'd Leave to go, and afterwards that he
also went for <HI>Holland,</HI> as soon as the Wind
was fair.</P>
<P>But note, all the Evidence was clos'd
and order'd to be summ'd up the 9th of
<HI>February;</HI> so that he need not afterwards to
have gone. And whereas he insinuates,</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> It doth no where appear, that ei∣ther
he, or <HI>Vaness,</HI> were ever thought on
for Witnesses.
that he and <HI>Vaness</HI> were secreted, and kept
from being Witnesses:</P>
<P><HI>Hauseur</HI> swears he return'd again to Sir
<HI>John</HI> in Summer 92, being often sent to by
Sir <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas <HI>Bayly,</HI> another of the Duke's
Witnesses, swears he did not return again
to Sir <HI>John</HI> in two Years after he went a∣way,
<HI>Bayly,</HI> the Witness, being all that
Time, and three Years before, a Servant
in the House.</P>
<P><HI>Note also,</HI> That this very Summer 92, to
wit, in <HI>Easter</HI> Term, the Duke brought
his Action against Sir <HI>John,</HI> which was
<PB N="229" REF="228"/>
try'd <HI>Michaelmas</HI> Term 92; at which Time
it had been more likely, if Sir <HI>John</HI> had
believ'd he could have done him any Harm,
he should have kept in <HI>Holland,</HI> rather
than have sent for him over; especially,
considering that this Fellow afterwards
swears, Sir <HI>John</HI> swore in a Rage this Fel∣low
would betray him.</P>
<P><HI>Hauseur</HI> being ask'd who sent for <HI>Vaness</HI>
over,</P>
<P>He answer'd, That after he had pro∣mis'd
the Duke and Lord <HI>Howard,</HI> to speak
the Truth of what he knew, they desir'd
him, if he met <HI>Vaness,</HI> to desire her to come
over, and speak the Truth of what she
knew.</P>
<P>And being ask'd how long after he met
<HI>Vaness,</HI> answer'd, About 12 Months since.</P>
<P>And being ask'd when was the first Time
he spoke to her about her coming over to
speak the Truth, answer'd, 'Tis about a
Year since.</P>
<P>And being ask'd how long it was since
they resolv'd to come over, answer'd, 12
Months.</P>
<P><HI>Vaness</HI> being ask'd, whether she was not
sent for from <HI>Holland</HI> to be a Witness, an∣swer'd,
She knew nothing of it 'till eight
or nine Weeks ago.</P>
<P><HI>Vaness</HI> swears she was sent away on Ac∣count
of the Tryal.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="229"/>
Whereas <HI>Peacock, Hawkesworth,</HI> and
<HI>Knight,</HI> three Servants of the Dutchess,
swore the Dutchess turn'd her away before
the Tryal, for keeping Company with
<HI>Dutch</HI> Soldiers, and they do swear a new
Cook-maid there before the Tryal.</P>
<P><HI>Hauseur</HI> swears he had a Key of the
Door going into the <HI>Park,</HI> and could come
in when he would,</P>
<P>And yet owns, he knew but two of
the Servants, one whereof is long since
dead.</P>
<P>And also the Dutchess's Servants swear
they never heard any Body had a Key, and
that if any Key had been, they must have
known of it; they also prove the shutting
up, bolting and chaining the Door every
Night, and opening it every Morning; and
but one of the Servants remembers ever to
have seen him at the Door, and then he
rung the Bell, but came only to see a Coun∣try-woman
of his, and to carry Letters to
<HI>Holland,</HI> and brought Answer back to her,
but was not admitted beyond the Passage.</P>
<P><HI>Hauseur</HI> and <HI>Vaness</HI> swear they saw the
Dutchess and Sir <HI>John</HI> in Bed together at
<HI>Mill-bank.</HI></P>
<P>The Dutchess's Woman swore she has
put the Dutchess to Bed, and taken her up
every Night and Morning several Years,
and never saw him in the House. And
two others swear they were constantly in
<PB N="231" REF="230"/>
waiting Night and Morning, and positive∣ly
deny any Knowledge of any such thing,
and say they never saw <HI>Hauseur</HI> there, and
that <HI>Vaness</HI> was never admitted up Stairs,
she was so dirty a Creature, much less to
dress or undress the Dutchess, as she pre∣tended
often to have done.</P>
<P><HI>Vaness</HI> swears she could not tell the Pla∣ces
she has been at these six Weeks last past.
Whereas</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>May,</HI> and two other of the Duke's
Servants, swear she has been fourteen Days
in the Duke's own House, with the full
Liberty of the House.</P>
<P><HI>Vaness</HI> being ask'd whether she ever told
any body of the Occasion of her going a∣way,
she swore, yes, she told it to a
great many in <HI>Holland,</HI> and not here.</P>
<P>Yet being afterwards ask'd, whether she
ever discover'd that she was sent out of
the Way, she swore directly, No.</P>
<P>These are some of the many plain Con∣tradictions
and Disproofs of these Eviden∣ces,
besides the great Improbability in
their own Nature in several Things sworn.</P>
<P>But it is also to be noted, that <HI>Hauseur</HI>
left Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Service in a Disgust; and so
it is prov'd by <HI>Baily,</HI> another of the Duke's
Witnesses; and that what <HI>Hauseur</HI> swore,
could be nothing but Spight and Malice.
Yea, it is prov'd, on the Dutchess's Part,
that he swore he would find a Way to be
<PB N="232" REF="231"/>
reveng'd of him, and that perhaps it might
not be long first; and Mr. <HI>Strange,</HI> Mrs.
<HI>Pitts,</HI> and her two Maids, who could have
depos'd very materially for the Dutchess,
refus'd to appear, tho often summon'd; be∣ing
Persons not in the Dutchess's Interest
or Power.</P>
<P>This <HI>Hauseur</HI> has been out of Place ever
since he left Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Service, <HI>April 96,</HI>
and is so still, as he swears: And so in
Consequence likely to be necessitous.</P>
<P><HI>Note</HI> also, That <HI>Hauseur</HI> swears Sir <HI>John</HI>
gave him seven Guineas to pay the Char∣ges
of himself, <HI>Vaness,</HI> and another, who
were order'd to be kept private, 'till they
could be shipp'd off, and also for their
Passage into <HI>Holland,</HI> which was, in Time,
from the 8th of <HI>Feb. 92,</HI> 'till <HI>Easter.</HI></P>
<P>Which does not look like a Bribe for a
Secret of this Nature, being hardly suffici∣ent
to maintain three People, and pay their
Lodgings, for two Months.</P>
<P><HI>Hauseur</HI> would be thought a mighty Con∣fident,
so as to have a Key to the Dutch∣ess's
House, to come in and go out when
he pleas'd; and yet, as well acquainted as
he pretended to be with the House, and
the Dutchess's Bed-Chamber, he could not
tell on what Floor it was, nor what Fur∣niture
it had, nor whether wainscotted or
hang'd: And when he was ask'd, which
Way the Windows of the Bed-chamber
<PB N="233" REF="232"/>
look'd to, he trifled in that Question, and
concluded he could see the Water, but was
afraid to go near the Window for Fear of
being discover'd, and yet had no Scruple
of coming into the House with his Key at
any Time.</P>
<P>These Things being observ'd, it must be
consider'd, that the Facts now in Effect
charg'd against the Dutchess, are suggested
to be done many Years since, and were de∣lated
and consider'd before the Peers, be∣fore
the Rejection of the two first Bills, and
long before the Agreement for putting an
End to all Controversies and Debates. Now
'tis very hard to put the Dutchess to Ac∣count
again, for those very Facts, consi∣dering
that, after eight or nine Years, ma∣ny
People are dead, others dispers'd, and
not in a little time to be found out, and
Circumstances of Times and Places (which
in the Nature of all these Cases is almost
all that is left to discover a Falsity) forgot.</P>
<P>The Dutchess is also under the unavoida∣ble
Necessity of proving a Negative against
downright Swearing, and without any
Matter introductory; and also by two
mean Servants, the one turn'd out of her
Place for keeping Company with Foot-Sol∣diers,
and the other leaving his Place in
Disgust, because he could not have the
Play-Money.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="233"/>
Masters are already too much in the Power
of their Servants, and if they charge their
Masters with Adultery, Felony, and even
Treason, it is not easily in the Power of
the Master to defend himself against down∣right
Swearing; Servants having those
Opportunities of the Knowledge of Times,
and Places, and Company, which cannot
be deny'd or avoided, and which others
have not, whereupon they may frame and
build false Evidence, and many Times are
of ill Principles and desperate Fortunes,
and of Tempers very revengeful; so that
whoever turns away a Servant, he is in
his Power for his Estate, Honour, and e∣ven
Life itself. And therefore, for the
Safety and Freedom of Families, in other
Countries they are not permitted to be E∣vidence
against their Masters in any Mat∣ter
criminal whatsoever.</P>
<P>Note also, That the Dutchess thinks she,
as an <HI>English</HI> Subject, has, by <HI>Magna Char∣ta,</HI>
the same Right to a Tryal, in the le∣gal
and ordinary Way of Justice, as the
rest of the King's Subjects, especially con∣sidering
that there never yet was in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
one Precedent of a Bill exhibited in
Parliament to dissolve a Marriage at the
first Instance, without any previous Pro∣ceedings
in the Ecclesiastical Courts;
(which in these Cases is the Law of the
Land) and not above five or six Bills,
<PB N="235" REF="234"/>
in above 600 Years, ever pass'd to dissolve
Marriages, or make second Marriages good,
even after there had been a Divorce in the
Spiritual Courts; and those Bills too, in
Cases generally where the Husbands were
without any Re-crimination.</P>
<P>No Impediment appears why the Duke
should not have endeavour'd a Divorce at
Law, before he had attempted a Bill to
dissolve the Marriage. For any Applica∣tion
to the Legislature, for Tryal of Mat∣ters
of private Right, is improper; because
there are proper Judicatures, that give that
Remedy the Law allows.</P>
<P>To ask any thing of the Legislature, in
private Causes between Party and Party,
beyond what the known Laws in Force
give, seems to be improper; because,</P>
<P>1. It is to make a Law in one Person's
Case, which is not the Law in another's.</P>
<P>2. It is to retrospect Actions, and, after
the Fact, to augment or alter the Penal∣ty.
Our Laws are certain and known,
that Persons may conform their Actions
to them.</P>
<P>3. The Courts and Forms of Law are
equally the Subjects Right with the Law;
and the Application to the Legislature
takes away all that Right of Form and
Charging; whereas a Certainty in Time
to answer, and Exceptions to Witnesses,
<PB N="236" REF="235"/>
and other legal Defences of the Fact, can∣not
be deny'd the meanest Subject.</P>
<P>The Consequence that short and summa∣ry
Ways of Proceedings may have on the
Settlements of Estates and Families, may
be very dangerous; and tho' the Duke of
<HI>Norfolk</HI>'s Bill pass'd the House of Peers, yet
a great Number of the Peers both Spiritual
and Temporal, enter'd their Protest against
its Passing, and their Reasons for it.</P>
<P>It ought to be no Prejudice to the
Dutchess, that the next Heir presumptive
to the Duke, doth not as yet appear to be
a Protestant; because when the Bill, which
hath lately pass'd both Houses, is become
a Law, it is not likely that noble Fami∣ly
will be without a Protestant at the
Head of it.</P>
<P>If any of the Witnesses formerly exa∣min'd
on the Bill in 1694, be now again
produc'd; it is humbly apprehended, that
as the Validity of their Testimony they
then gave, was totally overthrown by a
greater Number of Witnesses, so it will be
again; tho' under the Disadvantage of the
great Distance of Time.</P>

entituled, The CASE of MARY
Dutchess of NORFOLK.</HEAD>
<P>IF notorious Untruths, and false Infe∣rences,
deserve the Name of a scanda∣lous
Libel, the said printed Case is one.</P>
<P>The Case sets forth, That her Father,
the late Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> paid <HI>10000 l.</HI>
in Money, and settled near <HI>1000 l. per
Ann.</HI> in Lands, the Remainder thereof to
the Duke and his Heirs; and a Personal
Estate of <HI>10000 l.</HI> (after the Decease of the
said Earl and Countess) and also <HI>1000 l.
per Ann.</HI> for twenty Years: Besides very
rich Jewels, Plate, and other Things of
great Value, which the said Dutchess
brought into the Duke's Family. And it's
pretended, that her Grace hath, since her
Separation, paid great Debts that had been
contracted for the Support of the Duke's
Honour and his Service.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Neither the Duke, nor his Father,
receiv'd from her Grace's Family any more
than <HI>10000 l.</HI> to evidence which, if the
Duke pays back the <HI>10000 l.</HI> as the Bill
directs, then her Estate is as entire, and
<PB N="238" REF="237"/>
free to all Intents, as if he had never mar∣ry'd
her.</P>
<P>As to his having <HI>1000 l. per Ann.</HI> for
twenty Years to his Use, as is pretended,
the Duke absolutely denies it; or that he
has Jewels, Plate, or any thing of five
Pounds Value from her or her Family:
But soon after they marry'd, he was oblig'd
to borrow <HI>1500 l.</HI> to buy Linnen and
Houshold-Goods.</P>
<P>That within three Years, which hap∣pen'd
between the late Duke's Death, and
the parting of the Duke and Dutchess, she
ran him out by extravagant Expences, near
<HI>30000 l.</HI> above his Income; to pay which,
oblig'd him to sell his Life in <HI>2400 l. per
Ann.</HI> out of his Estate in <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>York∣shire.</HI></P>
<P>That she has been so far from paying
any Debts for his Honour and Service, that
he has been su'd, and forc'd to pay several
considerable Sums to Trades-men (contract∣ed
by her without his Privacy) tho' she
had a <HI>1000 l.</HI> a Year Pin-money all the
while.</P>
<P>That upon her Refusal to go into the
Country, and her Father's refusing to re∣ceive
her in any House of his, she at her
own Request chose to go into <HI>France.</HI> But
the Duke did not concern himself whether
she came back, or not, nor ever heard of
her Change of Religion, 'till he felt it (as
<PB N="239" REF="238"/>
well as heard it) by her suing him before
the High-Commission'd Court of Alimony,
which forc'd him to retire beyond-Sea, from
whence he return'd about two Months be∣fore
the King's Landing</P>
<P>It is a great Assurance that the Dutchess's
Agents have, to mention what was sworn
by her Servants, as disproving <HI>Hauseur</HI> and
<HI>Vaness;</HI> when it appear'd so plainly, that
they were taught a Lesson which they
greatly mistook; and instead of disappro∣ving,
confirm'd the chief Part of the others
Evidence.</P>
<P>And it's Pleasant, that instead of <HI>Susan∣nah
Barrington,</HI> who has been charg'd with
the Privacy of the whole Intrigue, and
appears to have been in the Dutchess's Ser∣vice
all along, and likewise since the bring∣ing
in this Bill, they should advance that
infamous Witness <HI>Frances Knight</HI> to the
Dutchess's Woman.</P>
<P>What they say of <HI>Bayly</HI>'s contradicting <HI>Hau∣seur,</HI>
is upon a Mistake, which <HI>Bayly</HI> himself
soon corrected: And the Dutchess's Ser∣vants
were so far from proving the <HI>Dutch</HI>-Woman
<HI>Vaness</HI> turn'd away before the re∣jecting
the last Bill, that one of the Dutch∣ess's

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Thomas Powys.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Speaker,</HI> with your
Favour, Sir, I am of Council with the Pe∣titioner,
the Dutchess of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> against
his Bill that is now before you; and I be∣lieve
I may say, with some Assurance, that
<PB N="242" REF="241"/>
this Bill, in the Manner as it is now
brought before you, is the first that ever
was attempted in this honourable House.
It's true, Sir, that several Years ago, this
Bill, or another of the same Nature, was
attempted twice in the other House, and
as often rejected; but 'tis as true, at last,
it does come from thence hither, but not
without a Protestation there; and I hum∣bly
hope you will take Notice, that this is
a Bill of Divorce in Parliament, in the
first Instance, without a previous Prosecu∣tion,
to examine the Fact in any of the
ordinary Courts, that have Authority in
these Matters.</P>
<P>It is a Bill, not only to divorce the
Dutchess upon a very short Warning, who
hath been a Wife twenty three Years,
but to render her infamous to all Posterity,
by Act of Parliament; which I account to
be the greatest Misfortune possible to befal
any Person; and, at the same Time, it
takes from her the legal Tryal of the Fact
whereof she is accus'd, and which she hath
a Right to, by the Law of the Land, sure
as much as the meanest Subject; and which
we don't apprehend she has in any wise
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orfeited; nor is there any Reason assign'd
why his Grace has not been pleas'd to pro∣ceed
in the ordinary Course. I hope, Sir
you will take Notice also, that this is, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Truth, nothing but a Suit between Party
<PB N="243" REF="242"/>
and Party. 'Tis meerly a Cause matri∣monial
between Husband and Wife, began
originally in the House of Peers; and as
hitherto, the Beginning of Causes between
Party and Party, in that House, hath been
strongly oppos'd; so, I hope, it will be
thought reasonable to do so always; be∣cause
it deprives the Subject of that legal
Defence due to him by the Law of the
Land. If this was always complain'd of,
when the Proceedings were in a Judicial
Way; surely, 'tis a great deal worse, to
begin there a private Cause between Party
and Party in the Legislative Way. I can
see no manner of Difference, with respect
to the Loss of those great Advantages the
Party is intitul'd to, only this seems rather
to be the most against Reason.</P>
<P>Sir, This is a summary Proceeding with a
Witness: It began but the 16th of <HI>Februa∣ry,</HI>
and but a Week's Time was given to
the Party accus'd of so high a Crime, and
of so great Consequence to the Party ac∣cus'd,
to be heard to it; and tho', perhaps,
we may, with Reason enough, find Fault
with the tedious Proceedings in some Courts,
where Appeals and Writs of Error are just∣ly
due; as where Property is well fix'd, it
must needs be reasonable. I say, from va∣rious
Causes, tho' Suits in the ordinary
Courts are very tedious; yet, I am sure,
a summary Way of Proceeding without due
<PB N="244" REF="243"/>
Warning, or any certain Way of making
Defence by any known Rules, and without
Oath, as here, without Appeal, without
any Possibility of retrieving the Matter
again, with great Submission. And if this
must be for all that one has in the World,
such a summary Way is a very terrible
Thing.</P>
<P>I would be glad any would make it
their own Case, and think with themselves,
how they should like it, if their Life, Estate,
and all they had, were put upon such a
summary Way of Proceeding. 'Tis true,
in some Kingdoms, where the Government
is Arbitrary, the Proceedings are summa∣rily,
and most commonly they go toge∣ther;
and if we were in a Place where the
Judges were infallible, and there were no
false Witnesses, and Truth could be dis∣cover'd
at an Instant, a summary Way
would be best; but since Men are fallible,
since there is Passion and Partiality in the
World, since oftentimes there are notorious
Detections of Perjury, and several Things
are difficult to be disclos'd, and require a
reasonable Time for examining into Facts;
from thence it is, that there are settled
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for determining all Questions in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Party and Party; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> good Methods

<P><PB N="245" REF="244"/>
Whatever you may think of this parti∣cular
Case of the Dutchess of <HI>Norfolk;</HI> the
Example is of mighty Consequence to all
Parents, that, perhaps, make hard Shift to
give their Daughters considerable Portions,
and may think they have marry'd them
well, and made Provision for them and
their Children. I say it will be hard, if
their Daughters should be sent Home to
them upon a Fortnight's Warning; and
that Witnesses should be examin'd against
them, without their having Notice so much
as of the Places of their Abode; and a
Thing should be determin'd, before the
Witnesses can be well known. And it must
be agreed to be of great Consequence to all
Colateral Heirs, if Marriages are so easily
and suddenly set aside for want of Issue,
which I find to be one of the Causes as∣sign'd
for this Bill; and that it may be in
a summary Way, perhaps, before they can
well hear of it. I am sure, this is a Mat∣ter
of too great Temptation, to be put upon
Men that may grow weary of their Wives,
and desire a better Fortune, or desire
Change, or may be mov'd by a thousand
Reasons we can't think off, to revive old
Quarrels, and think of Things long since
pass'd, if you will set such a Precedent of
Divorcing in such a summary Way.</P>
<P>This is sure of infinite Concern to us in
higher Matters. A Bill of Divorce of a
<PB N="246" REF="245"/>
Woman in Parliament, without a legal
Tryal, is just the same Thing, as a Bill of
Attainder against a Man for Treason; the
one forfeits the Estate, corrupts the Blood,
and takes away his Life; and the other
does very little less: For, I find, according
to the Bill, 'tis to forfeit her Jointure, to
defame her Person, corrupt her Reputation;
and tho' it leave her Life, it is left with
Infamy, which is worse than Death; and
in a Case of this high Moment, sure you
will be careful how you alter the Course
of Tryals. I beseech you, Sir, will not
the Reason be the same, that a Bill of
Attainder may be brought against a Man,
and that Witnesses against him may be
fetch'd from beyond-Sea, which he had
formerly discharg'd from his Service; and
put the other Side to prove what is always
very difficult, the Negative, to make his De∣fence,
which must needs require a reasona∣ble
Time for the making out of Circumstan∣ces,
and laying Evidence together? Where
will be the Difference between proceeding
against a Man for his Life without a Tryal,
and proceeding against a Woman for her
Joynture, where her Name, Family, and
Reputation is concern'd; and perhaps her
Children, the Legitimacy of whom must
come in Question? And, in a Case, where
the Person, by no Behaviour of hers, hath
forfeited such a Tryal, nor the Person, that
<PB N="247" REF="246"/>
prosecutes this Bill, can't shew that he
hath been obstructed in his proceeding in
the ordinary Way. I need not take Notice
of what every Body knows, That we have
a happy Constitution, if we can keep it;
every Man can call his Wife his own, and
his Estate his own; because it can't be ta∣ken
away, but by legal Tryal: But if you
will go into these extraordinary Resorts,
when the Courts and the Law is open,
without any previous Preparations for
that Matter, by having a fair Examina∣tion,
that the Party can't say there is a
Surprise, I know not where it will end;
and tho' in one Case it may be desirable,
that there should be an extraordinary Re∣lief;
but will this go no farther? Can any
say that?</P>
<P>That which we find in <HI>Magna Charta</HI> is
not to be forgot, where there is so much
Care in the several Instances of it for the
preserving of Property, and the Right of
Tryals, <HI>Quod nullus destruatur, nec super
eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus, nisi per
legale judicium parium suorum vel per legem
terrae.</HI></P>
<P>Why? In this Case, the Ecclesiastical
Law is <HI>Lex Terrae:</HI> And if that be to be
taken away, without any Reason, why
may not the Law in any other Case.</P>
<P>We have, perhaps, in Time of great E∣mergency
and publick Difficulties, had
<PB N="248" REF="247"/>
some extraordinary Laws, grounded on
extraordinary Reasons; but now we are in
a Time of settled Peace, when there may
be a just Determination, according to the
Law of the Land, I can't see any Reason
for this Proceeding, no, not in this parti∣cular
Case.</P>
<P>I would, Sir, with your Favour, take
Notice of those few Instances of this Kind,
that have been in <HI>England,</HI> by Act of Par∣liament,
and in what Manner they have
proceeded.</P>
<P>There have not pass'd hardly six in six
hundred Years, I think I may challenge
them, on the other Side, to shew so great a
Number; but those I have I shall quote:
But they proceeded in another Manner
than this had done.</P>
<P>'Tis true, where Persons have had a fair
Tryal in a proper Court, and Witnesses
have been examin'd, and Sentence final
been pronounc'd, and where the Party, as
to the Fact, hath been concluded accor∣ding
to the Law of the Land; when all
this hath pass'd, some Instances there have
been, that afterwards an Act of Parlia∣ment
has pass'd to strengthen the Sentence,
and to carry it farther than the Ecclesiasti∣cal
Courts will allow, even to the dissol∣ving
the Marriage, and enabling the in∣nocent
Person to marry again; but you
will find all those Acts are founded and
<PB N="249" REF="248"/>
built upon the Sentence in those Courts,
and recite those Sentences, as a great In∣ducement
to the passing of those Acts; and
I crave Leave just to take Notice of those.
The first we find, is that made in the Case
of the Marquis of <HI>Northampton,</HI> which was
in 5 <HI>E. 6.</HI> He was marry'd to a Daughter
of the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and she elop'd from
him, and was prosecuted in the Ecclesiasti∣cal
Courts, and there was Sentence against
her of Divorce. The Marquis from hence
took upon him to marry a Daughter of the
Lord <HI>Cobham;</HI> and after four Years Mar∣riage
of her, he obtain'd an Act of Parlia∣ment
to ratify the second Marriage, which
Act recites a Settlement of Divorce in the
Ecclesiastical Court.</P>
<P>This took its Rise from Examination ac∣cording
to Law; and that Act of Parlia∣ment
is grounded upon it, and recites it as
a previous Matter necessary to induce that
Act.</P>
<P>The next, that follows, was the famous
Case of the Lord <HI>Ross,</HI> afterwards Earl of
<HI>Rutland,</HI> tho' there, perhaps, was as great
a Notoriety of Fact as can be pretended in
this Case; and he did not stand impeach'd
of any immodest Behaviour; but, even in
that Case, the Divorce by the Act fol∣low'd
a Divorce in the Ecclesiastical Court,
and that pass'd with such Difficulty, that
it was four Years in Hand: it began in 66▪
<PB N="250" REF="249"/>
and was not pass'd 'till 70. I have a Co∣py
of it, and it says, that forasmuch as
<HI>Mannors,</HI> commonly call'd L. <HI>Ross.</HI></P>
<P>And it proceeds thereupon to enable
him to marry again: But this, Sir, could
not be, but by two Acts of Parliament,
besides the Sentence in the Ecclesiastical
Court; for he first got that Court to de∣clare
the Children illegitimate, and then,
in the Year 70, the Parliament pass'd
this Act.</P>
<P>I know of no other, 'till we come to a
Case that happen'd within our Memory;
'tis the Case of a Person of great Worth,
and I hope it will give no Offence when I
cite the Precedent.</P>
<P>It was the Case of Mr. <HI>Lukenor,</HI> who
had been grossly abus'd by his Wife, by
Elopement, and open Adultery; but the
Act he obtain'd went no farther, than to
disable the Children born while she liv'd
in open Adultery; and that Act recites a
Sentence of Divorce; I have the Copy of
it, and I crave leave I may read a few
Lines of it; it recites, that Mr. <HI>Lukenor</HI>'s
Wife had elop'd from her Husband.</P>
<P>There was, indeed, a famous Case not
long ago, of a Lady that was taken away
by Force, and pretended to be marry'd;
and an Act of Parliament came afterwards
to declare that Marriage null and void;
but even there was a Proceeding at Law
<PB N="251" REF="250"/>
with a Witness; the Person that had been
concern'd, was actually indicted, and exe∣cuted:
It was not there to make a Divorce;
and so it had been a vain Thing, to have
gone into the Spiritual Court, where there
was no Marriage; for it was only a Law
after the Fact, Declaratory, by Way of
Caution, to give the more Satisfaction that
that Marriage was null and void.</P>
<P>Sir, the last I know of (and it may be
proper for you to observe how quick these
People come after it) was that of a noble
Earl, that did obtain last Parliament an
Act for divorcing him and his Lady. It
is the Case of the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield;</HI> but
in that Case it will be proper to take No∣tice
to you, that there were previous Pro∣ceedings
in the Ecclesiastical Court; there
was a Libel exhibited against her, a Charge
upon her, and Witnesses examin'd, and she
had a fair Opportunity of making her De∣fence;
there was a regular and a long
Proceeding against her, and a Prosecution
of her, in Order to a Sentence of Excom∣munication;
and then there came the
Earl's Petition into the House of Peers,
setting forth, that there had been such a
Proceeding as this, and that she stood in
Contempt, having been prosecuted as far
as that Court could go, after an Examina∣tion
of Witnesses. In all the Cases I have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a Divorce by Act of Parliment,
<PB N="252" REF="251"/>
there have been Proceedings in the Eccle∣siastical
Court. This was the Way of for∣mer
Times, but now we are beginning
where the Matter ought to end.</P>
<P>And now the first Application is to that
Place, wherein all these Instances (as I
think it ought to be) was the last Resort.
'Tis true, this Method may not please the
Duke; for we know his Grace is in haste,
and for cutting the Knot asunder at once
by the Legislative Power; but, I hope,
upon these Precedents, you will think it
more reasonable it should be at first unty'd,
or, at least, loosen'd by a judicial Pro∣ceeding.
If you will, I do not see how,
in Justice, the Parliament can deny the
like Remedy the next Sessions to any other
that may be in the like Case, it may be
in worse; for here is no Pretence of any
spurious Issue. Can the Parliament of <HI>Eng∣liament,</HI>
whence we take our Measures of
Justice, deny the like Remedy in Justice to
any others that are in the like Case? What
is it that guards you from an infinite Ap∣plication
of this Nature, but requiring Per∣sons
to take the ordinary Course first; and
to come round about to the Parliament, as
the last Remedy, to carry the Sentence,
perhaps, farther than the Ecclesiastical
Court can do? But if Persons may come
up directly hither, I am apt to think your
Lobby will be crowded with Petitioners of
<PB N="253" REF="252"/>
this Nature the next Sessions; tho' the Ses∣sions
now are long and frequent, this single
Business may be so great as to obstruct all
other Business; I am sure, a Committee for
Adultery would have a full Employment.</P>
<P>Let it be consider'd, how strange it would
be if some Poor Man, upon this Precedent,
should come and make Application, and tell
you, he stands in Need of such a Bill from
the Condition of his Family; that his
Wife plunders his House, sells his Goods,
and lives in Adultery; and prays this Mat∣ter
may be examin'd in a summary Way,
because he is not able to go through the
costly Course of Ecclesiastical Courts, and be
favour'd with a Divorce: Would not this
poor Man's Case seem to have the like Ju∣stice,
or possibly more? And yet, if such a
mean Man should come with such a Petition,
perhaps, it would look strange; and yet, in
Justice, there is no Respect of Persons; the
Law in <HI>England</HI> is, <HI>unum pondus &amp; una mensu∣ra;</HI>
and if this should be done in the Case
of a great and rich Man, and not for a poor
Man, they may say what hath been said
by some, That our Laws are like the Spi∣der's
Web, which only holds the lesser In∣sects.</P>
<P>Shall those that expect the best Fortunes
and greatest Advantage by Marriage, not
undergo the bad Fortune of Marriage too?
<PB N="254" REF="253"/>
I am sure, if this be so, it's a Privilege of
Peerage never thought of before.</P>
<P>You may see, Sir, by this Bill, how
Precedents grow upon you. At first, in the
Case of the Marquis of <HI>Northampton,</HI> it
was hard to get an Act after a Divorce: So
it was in the Case of my Lord <HI>Ross:</HI> The
last Sessions, in the Case of the Earl of
<HI>Macclesfield</HI> it went farther there; because
there had been a previous Proceeding in
the Ecclesiastical Court, and his Lady had
obstructed that Sentence; that Act pass'd
before Sentence; but now we are come
to have it done without so much as a
Tryal to get a Divorce in the Ecclesiasti∣cal
Courts, to have all pass'd at once in a
summary Way, it will be but to petition
the Parliament, and all shall be determin'd
without a Possibility of being re-heard.</P>
<P>I know nothing can be said on the
other side with good Reason (unless that
which I heard in another Place) why they
should not go to the Ecclesiastical Court,
which is, that those Courts cannot divorce
a <HI>Vinculo</HI> Matrimony; therefore it would
have been a vain Thing. This may be a
good Reason for them to come to you after∣wards;
but 'tis no Reason for them to come
here at first, unless they will say at the
same Time, that every thing ought to be
begun in Parliament, because 'tis possible
every thing may be brought to the House
<PB N="255" REF="254"/>
of Peers at last. Will they say, That all
Ejectments ought to be begun originally in
the House of Peers; because after the Par∣ties
have been at great Charge and Trou∣ble
in the Courts below, they may be
brought thither by Writ of Error at last.
This would have been a good Expedient
in a Cause lately, where a Deed was try'd
over and over; if this be the Rule, it
would be well it were known, and made to
the Law of the Kingdom; for that Law
will be always reckon'd hard, which is
made in one Case, if it may not be had
in another; the Law of <HI>England</HI> does go
throughout, and if it be Law for one, 'tis
for another. I have but one Thing more
to lay before you, and that seems worthy
of your Consideration, besides all that I
have said.</P>
<P>You observe the Bill is general, without
Restraint of Time and Place, or Descrip∣tion,
or Circumstances relating to the
Fact: Now, Sir, I must take Leave to ac∣quaint
you, That so long ago as <HI>April,
1694,</HI> his Grace the Duke, (who complains
of this Matter, as if some new Misfortune
had befal'n him) having made former Com∣plaints
and Attempts for obtaining what
he now desires, did, at last, in <HI>April, 1694,</HI>
not suddenly, but by Advice of Coun∣cil,
with his Friends about him, after a
long Time of Agitation, come to Articles
<PB N="256" REF="255"/>
with his Wife the Dutchess, of which I
crave Leave only to read the Preamble.</P>
<P>The Articles are between his Grace the
Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Peterbo∣rough,</HI>
and recites—</P>
<P>It is therefore determin'd by the Parties,
and agreed as followeth; and thereupon
the Articles proceed to settle every thing
between the Duke and Dutchess, to his
own Satisfaction, and according to his own
Desire.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> printed Case</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> infra.</NOTE> His Grace hath reap'd the Bene∣fit
of those Articles, by having receiv'd a
great Sum of Money; and the Dutchess
parted with her Interest in that great and
noble Manour of <HI>Sheffeild;</HI> his Grace hath
had all that he, on his Part, was to have,
and hath executed abundance of Deeds pur∣suant
to this Agreement. Now, if after
all this, there be a Prospect of farther
Advantage by another Marriage, that will
not move you to give him a Liberty for a
Departure from so solemn an Agreement.
In what a Condition are People, that have
purchas'd their Peace as the Dutchess has,
if they may have Liberty to go back be∣yond
this, for the Bill has no stint; sure∣ly,
all Reconciliation between Men and
their Wives, and all Acts towards them,
and all Acts of Kindness are to be favour'd,
and Matters of Divorce are of an odious
<PB N="257" REF="256"/>
Nature, and not to be encourag'd after
such Composure of Differences, and Recon∣ciliation.
We have Instances of some that
have taken their Wives again, and liv'd
comfortably afterwards; surely, it shall
not be in their Power to go back, and say,
Pray let us be divorc'd. 'Tis contrary to
the Use of all Acts of Pardon. What is the
End of all Acts of Parliament, of general
Pardon, and all Statutes of Limitation,
but to ease the People in such a Case? For
'tis impossible that any Person can be able
to defend their Actions nine or ten Years
ago, they can't keep their Witnesses alive,
and therefore the Law hath often limited
a Time, beyond which, Persons shall not
go back; and this we think the Duke hath
done by Articles, and surely they are con∣clusive
before God and Man.</P>
<P>I shall say no more, but that I don't
apprehend the Nation will be in any great
Danger. If the Duke doth, betwixt this and
the next Session, proceed in the ordinary
Course, and prepare Matters against ano∣ther
Session; I am sure 'tis of great Con∣sequence.
No Man can deny, but we have
a good Constitution; but if it is, in the
Case of a particular Person, to be broken,
such a Breach in this Constitution may not
be very easily recover'd.</P>
<P>I hope, this Cause, that is precipitated
here out of Time, and before those Pre∣parations
<PB N="258" REF="257"/>
were made, that have been in
all other Cases, shall be remitted to its
proper Place, where her Grace will give
the Duke a Meeting, if they be not before
that reconcil'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dod.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Speaker,</HI> I desire the Favour of a
Word of the same Side. These Bills are
not common; I think there are not above
three Instances to be found in the Records
of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>This Bill is to dissolve a Marriage after
twenty three Years Continuance; and that
not upon so many Days Notice, as there
have been Years of the Marriage, for to
serve the particular Purposes of one Per∣son;
'tis a Law after the suppos'd Fact
committed; the Law should go first, and
the Fact follow; it is not a general Law
for all the People of <HI>England;</HI> as such, it
would have another Consideration; there
is no Occasion for particular Law; 'tis a
Bill from the Lords; and, in a little Time,
for what I know, the Lords will prescribe to
it; there is not one of these Bills for a Com∣moner,
unless in my Lord <HI>Ross</HI>'s Case,
who was of a noble Family.</P>
<P>'Tis not pretended by this Bill, that the
Dutchess hath had any spurious Issue, tho'
that was the Circumstance of one of the
Bills that did pass, and that was a mate∣rial
<PB N="259" REF="258"/>
Circumstance in the Case, and which is
not alledg'd here. These Bills are not to
be made use of, but upon extraordinary
Occasions, and the utmost Extremity; and
'till then, I hope, such Bills shall not be
made use of. And we think the Procee∣ding
upon this Bill, in this Case, will ap∣pear
much harder; for 'tis the first Instance
of this Nature, when there has been no
Proceeding in any Court whatsoever, to
convict the Dutchess of this Offence, no
Citation all this while in the Ecclesiastical
Courts, where the Dutchess might have
an Opportunity to make her Defence.</P>
<P>If those Courts have Jurisdiction in any
one Thing, 'tis in Case of Matrimony. If
this was brought into those Courts, the
Dutchess would be allow'd to make her
Defence, not only by Way of Re-crimina∣tion,
but Examination of Witnesses; a
Commission might be had to examine Wit∣nesses
beyond-Sea; if she had any Witnes∣ses
there, or in the Country; she might
appeal to a superior Court, and thence to
the Delegates. These are all proper De∣fences
that the Law allows, that there
may be no Surprise upon the Party; and
if injur'd, he may be righted in another
Place. These Proceedings, we think, are
necessary to go before a Bill of this Nature;
for then the Fact would be plain; and if
the Dutchess had been convicted in this
<PB N="260" REF="259"/>
Manner, as to the Fact, we must not have
open'd our Mouths against it.</P>
<P>By the same Reason that a Bill is brought
to dissolve this Marriage, in a little Time
you may have a Bill to marry People: Be
it enacted for such and such Reasons, such
Persons shall be marry'd: This would be a
much readier Way, in Case of Contracts,
than any Proceedings in the Ecclesiastical
Courts. And tho' they may say, the Law
of <HI>England</HI> takes Notice of Contracts of
Matrimony, as well as any other Acts,
that is no Answer; for the Fact is, Whe∣ther
there is any Contract of Matrimony,
or no? And so it is here, Whether my La∣dy
is guilty of the Crimes charged here in
the Bill? And for this she ought to have a
proper Tryal, and ought to be call'd to an
Account in the ordinary Methods of Law;
and then it might be proper to carry the
Sentence farther than those Courts can. I
hope you will be very tender of making a
new Precedent; and I do not know of any
Bill, before this, to convict a Woman of a
suppos'd Crime; then this is the first Bill
of this Nature, and you will consider, whe∣ther
you will make a Precedent of it, or
not. Tho' this before you, is the Case of a
great and honourable Person, yet your
Justice will be the same, if it should happen,
that any other Man in the Kingdom should
be in the same Circumstances, and willing
<PB N="261" REF="260"/>
to slip over all Tryals, whereby the Per∣son
accus'd might have an Opportunity of
making her just Defence; as is the Case of
this noble Lady, who is hurry'd on, after
twenty three Years Marriage, to a Deter∣mination
in as many Days, in this extra∣ordinary
Manner.</P>
<P>I hope, therefore, you will not proceed
in a Bill of this extraordinary Nature, of
which there is not one Instance to be given,
where you have begun to examine a sup∣pos'd
Crime, but you have always left it
to the Determination of the Law in the
ordinary Course; and we think it ought ra∣ther
to be so in this Case; because, 'tis not
pretended by the Bill, that there is any
Stop put to their Proceedings there; there
is no Absence of Witnesses, no Incapacity;
but his Grace may proceed there, to convict
this Lady of the Crime he supposes her
guilty of, and she will there have her just
Defence; and, till then, there is no Crime
for you to judge upon; and, I hope, you
will think fit to reject this Bill.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. Pinfold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Speaker,</HI> I desire to speak a few
Words as to the Ecclesiastical Law, which
is a Part of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> as much
as any other; for our Law does not receive
<HI>majus &amp; minus;</HI> and the Ecclesiastical
Courts have been settl'd for several Ages,
<PB N="262" REF="261"/>
and are govern'd by such Rules, which every
Subject hath a Right to. Sir, This Bill is
to dissolve the Bond of Marriage, and to
give Leave to marry again; and I crave
leave to shew the House what our Ecclesi∣astical
Constitutions are in that Case, and
how tender they have been in that Point,
and how those Constitutions are grounded
upon the Canons and Decrees of Councils.</P>
<P>The Cases where the Bond of Marriage
is to be dissolv'd, are but few, and they
arise before Marriage; 'tis in the Case of
the Pre-contract, or Nonage, or Consangui∣nity;
and there the Bond is broken by the
Sentence of the Judge, and the Person hath
Liberty to marry again: But for what
comes afterwards, whether it be the Case
of Adultery, or any thing else, the Law
Ecclesiastical, which, as I said before,
is Part of the Law of <HI>England,</HI> hath been
very careful not to dissolve the Marriage.</P>
<P>The 48th Canon says, If any Lay-man
shall put away his Wife, and marry ano∣ther,
he shall be excommunicated: That
was the Sense of those early Days; and
sure they did not think it an indifferent
Matter, because they punish'd it with so
heavy a Punishment. So it was in the
Council of <HI>Arles, 314;</HI> and there it was
decreed, That if a Man took his Wife in
Adultery, he should be forbidden to mar∣ry.
There, what was to be done? Coun∣cil
<PB N="263" REF="262"/>
should be given him not to marry
while she liv'd, though she was an Adul∣tress.</P>
<P>And in the Council 402, the <HI>Neapolitan,</HI>
Evangelical, Apostolical Council, it was
decreed, That if a Man was divorc'd from
his Wife, or Wife from her Husband, they
should remain unmarry'd. This was the
Sense of the antient Canons and Coun∣cils,
and this is receiv'd into our Ecclesi∣astical
Constitution. In the 15th Year of
the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the Chap∣ter
of Divorces, 'tis said, That upon a
Sentence of Divorce, there must be an
Admonition, and a Prohibition, that the
Party shall not marry again.</P>
<P>And in the Year 1602, in the Beginning
of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, there was a farther
Provision made, to keep them from be∣ing
marry'd again, and that was this,
That they should give Bond and Security
they should not marry again. This is
certainly our Ecclesiastical Constitution,
and grounded on the Sense of the Anci∣ent
Canons.</P>
<P>Now it remains, to shew some Advan∣tage
this would have had, if she had had
the Tryal, which, of common Right, is
due to the meanest Subject; she would
have had the Advantage of Challenges,
which she can't have here; for here the
Evidence must drop from the Witnesses
<PB N="264" REF="263"/>
Mouths, who are Foreigners, and have
been long absent; there they must give
an Account of themselves, which here hath
not been done by any Body. This Lady
might have given her Exceptions to those
Witnesses, and had a Commission into
<HI>Holland,</HI> to have examin'd how these Wit∣nesses
have behav'd themselves, and whe∣ther
these Persons were to be believ'd
and credited; here she would likewise
have had Liberty to give an Account how
this Design began. I do now speak with
respect to the Duke; but I do say, it does
seem to have began a Year and a half
ago. She would likewise have had the
Advantage of a thorough Reconciliation;
and here are some Deeds, in 94, between
the Duke and the Dutchess, which I hope,
if the House will take an Account of,
will have its due Effect: She would like∣wise
have had the Advantage of an Appeal,
the common Right of the Subject, and
grounded upon good Reason; and in case
there hath been a Neglect in the first
Instances, the Party may be righted in
another Place.</P>
<P>By this Bill she is debar'd of the Ad∣vantage
of Re-crimination, to which she
hath a Right; for the Text-Law is—</P>
<P>And the Text-Law, <HI>de Divortiis,</HI> is
the same, were the Charge most true,
which we do not admit; yet, if she can
<PB N="265" REF="264"/>
prove the same thing against her Husband,
the Fault of one must be set against the
Fault of another, and he can't have the
Advantage of his Prayer.</P>
<P>I shall repeat only one thing more,
and that is the Case quoted already of
the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield;</HI> but, in that Case,
the Lady withdrew herself five or six
Days before Sentence; yet there the Lady
<HI>Macclesfield</HI> had all her Defences, and even
her Recriminations, and had a Time to
prove it: There was Publication, and a
Day set down for Sentence, but she spun
out the Time 'till the Parliament was
ready to rise, and then my Lord's Friends
advis'd him to begin in Parliament; and
when the Lords were acquainted of my
Lady <HI>Macclesfield</HI>'s standing in Contempt
of the Court, and she was prosecuted so
far, that she was almost ready to go to
Prison for her Contempt, then the House
of Lords did think fit to receive my Lord
<HI>Macclefield</HI>'s Bill, and not before; but be∣fore
my Lord <HI>Macclesfield</HI> brought his Bill
in Parliament, there was nothing remain'd
to be done in the Ecclesiastical Courts
but Sentence. And I hope, for all these
Reasons, you will not proceed upon this
Bill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Serg. Wright.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Speaker,</HI> I am of
Council for the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who is
your Suppli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt for this Bill, for Redress
<PB N="266" REF="265"/>
against the highest Injury that can be of∣fer'd;
the Rights of his Marriage-Bed
have been Invaded; and he comes for that
Relief here, which no other Court can af∣ford
him; for the Learned Doctor on the
other Side, tells you plainly from the
Canon Law, that there can be no Divorce,
<HI>à Vinculo Matrimonii</HI> in their Courts. Now
to send us to a Court for Relief, that
they tell us before-hand can give us none,
is in Effect to tell us, we shall have none
at all.</P>
<P>The Bill is founded upon the Suggesti∣ons
contain'd in the first three or four
Lines in the Bill, That the Dutchess of
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> hath for divers Years liv'd in
Separation from the Duke her Husband,
and hath had unlawful Familiarity, and
Adulterous Conversation with Sir <HI>John
Germaine,</HI> and is Guilty of Adultery on
her Part, and hath broken the Bond of
Matrimony: These are the Reasons for
which the Duke desires this Bill may
pass; 'tis for the Adulterous Conversa∣tion
of the Dutchess, not for one single
Act, but a continual Series of the like
Acts for many Years; for we shall not
give only one single Act, or Instance, in
Evidence, but prove this Conversation for
several Years, beginning in Eighty Seven,
and carry'd on to the latter End of Ninety
Five.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="266"/>
It hath been objected, That this is the
first Instance of a Divorce, the first Bill
of this Kind, where there has been no
Proceedings in the Spiritual Court: That
'tis the first Bill of this Kind, we deny;
but that there have been no Proceedings
in the Spritual Court, we own; for the
Earl of <HI>Macclefield</HI>'s was the same, to all
Intents and Purposes, as this is; for tho'
'tis true, they had been in the Spiritual
Court, yet, 'tis as true, they came here
into Parliament, before any Sentence in
the Spiritual Court: Now, to what Pur∣pose
is it to go into the Spiritual Court,
and not to stay for the Determination of
that Court, if the Judgment of that Court
is to have any Weight: In the Case of
the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> 'tis true, they had
been there, and examin'd Witnesses on one
Side, with all Precipitation; yet would
they not stay for a Sentence there, but
quitted their own Proceedings, and came
to the Parliament. Now I do take it,
that they had better never been there,
than to have come away before Sentence.
For when they were in the Spiritual Court,
and were proceeding there, to leave that
Court, shew'd rather a Mistrust of their
own Case. But it was no Objection in
that Case, That it was taking it away
from the Jurisdiction of the Spiritual Court.
We don't come to you for any thing the
<PB N="268" REF="267"/>
Spiritual Court can grant us; For that
Court goes no farther, if the Fact be
prov'd, then to make a Separation <HI>à mensà
&amp; thoro;</HI> but the Bonds of Marriage is
to be continu'd still. Now, with Submis∣sion,
this is to punish the Innocent instead
of the Guilty. What would the Dutchess
desire more, than to be separated from
the Bed and Board of her Husband, to be
left free to accompany Sir <HI>John Germaine?</HI>
But we go farther; for we come to the
Parliament to dissolve this Marriage, for
that which is allow'd, by several learned
Writers, to be a justifiable Reason for so
doing, for Adultery committed by the
Wife, 'tis expresly said, That <HI>a Man shall
not put away his Wife, except in Case of
Fornication.</HI> This Text plainly allows,
that, in Case of Fornication, a Man might
put away his Wife; but the <HI>Popish</HI> Canons
(the Doctor has nam'd,) have put a Con∣struction
upon it; say they, you shall put
her away, but how? She shall be remov'd
from your Bed and Table, but you shall
not marry another. Then they say, There
is no Precedent of a Bill of this Kind,
but there hath been a previous Prosecu∣tion
in the Spiritual Courts; I agree, in the
Marquis of <HI>Northampton</HI>'s Case, that that
Act does recite the Proceedings in the
Spiritual Court; but that Case is stronger
than this, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here the Marquis of <HI>Nor∣thampton</HI>
<PB N="269" REF="268"/>
had marry'd, even in the Teeth
of their Canon Law; and comes afterwards
an Act of Parliament to make this Mar∣riage
good; and there the Divorce was no
Ingredient upon the passing of the Bill,
but the Parliament Enacted the Marriage
to be Lawful. In my Lord <HI>Ross</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Case,
there is no Mention of any Divorce. I
appeal to the Journals of your own
House for that. But notwithstanding the
Divorce, the whole Matter was examin'd
over again; Witnesses were examin'd, both
in the House of Lords, and here, upon the
first Bill which was brought, which was
to Illegitimate, and Bastardize the Chil∣dren;
and the Witnesses prov'd, that my
Lord <HI>Ross,</HI> and his Lady, had not laid to∣gether
for a long Time; and that she had
kept Company with others; so that the
Parliament did not found the Bill upon
what had been done upon the Divorce.</P>
<P>I appeal to your own Memory, that
in the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield</HI>'s Case there
was no Use at all on that Side, the Bill
was brought, that there had been Pro∣ceedings
in the Spiritual Court; nor is any
such thing recited in the Bill, but only
an express down right Charge of Adul∣tery;
nor was it proper for them to have
mention'd any Proceedings in the Spiri∣tual
Court, since they wav'd that Prose∣cution;
but we, on the other Side, insisted
<PB N="270" REF="269"/>
on it, as a Reason why the Parliament
should not proceed in it, it being to take
upon them an original Jurisdiction; but
we were then answer'd, by a Learned
Gentleman against this Bill. That it was
in vain to go there, for they could not
give the Remedy that might reasonably
be expected. I beg the favour to mention
a Case or two, where Divorces have been
in Parliament, and there have been no
Proceedings in the Spiritual Court: One
of them was the Case of Mrs. <HI>Knight,</HI>
who was marry'd <HI>infra Annos Nubiles,</HI> to
Mr. <HI>Goodwin.</HI> Every one knows, that a
Marriage, <HI>infra Annos Nubiles,</HI> is a good
Marriage, and if the Woman be above
Nine Years Old, she shall be Endowed;
and yet, notwithstanding, for some irre∣gular
Proceedings, without going into the
Spiritual Court, they came into Parlia∣ment,
and a Bill was pass'd, by which
this Marriage was dissolv'd, and, I think, 'tis
expresly Enacted, That she shall not marry
'till such an Age. This goes farther; for here
I am sure the Doctor would have complain'd,
and told you, if there had been Reason
to dissolve the Marriage, they could have
done as great a Feat in the Spiritual
Court; That they could have examin'd
Witnesses upon Oath, and could have told
you whether there was proper Evidence;
<PB N="271" REF="270"/>
yet the Parliament, without any regard
to what they could do, would assert their
own Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>The Case of Mr. <HI>Wharton</HI> was mention'd
on the other Side, and therefore I need not
say any thing to it. There was nothing
of Divorce, nor needed any.</P>
<P>They say this Bill begins where it is
proper for Matters of this Nature to end;
and that after we have taken a Turn into
the Spiritual Court, and travell'd three or
four Years there, then it will be fit for the
Judgment of Parliament. I would know
if they had been seven Years in that Court,
(and perhaps if we come there, we shall not
get out sooner) to what Use the Examina∣tion
of that Court would be. This House,
I presume, would not let those Depositions
be read here, especially if the Witnesses to
these Facts were living.</P>
<P>They say, This is a very summary Way
of proceeding, it may be too quick for the
Dutchess; but you may be pleas'd to con∣sider,
that there was a Bill brought into
the other House some Years ago and reje∣cted;
upon what Terms, that will rest upon
us, to shew you by and by.</P>
<P>But the Matter was, The Witnesses
that prov'd the Fact were sent out of the
Way by the Dutchess and Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI>
when things were under an Examination;
and we hope a Matter of this Nature ne∣ver
<PB N="272" REF="271"/>
shall be baffled, by keeping the Evi∣dence
out of the Way.</P>
<P>We told them long ago who the Witnes∣ses
were, they were the Dutchess's Servants,
such as they thought fit to intrust.</P>
<P>They say this Bill deprives the Dutch∣ess
of her Tryal. I hope no Body thinks
the Parliament will pass a Bill, without
due Examination of Witnesses, and legal
Proof of the Fact, if so, what Matter is
it, whether the Proof be made before the
Parliament, or some inferiour Court; if the
Dutchess be guilty of this Crime, we come
here for Relief, which the Spiritual Court,
the Doctors tell you, can't give us; since
the Dutchess hath broke the Bond of Ma∣trimony,
we come to you to dissolve that
Marriage, and I hope we shall have it.</P>
<P>The Doctor hath insisted on one Thing
that I think is very extraordinary. He
tells you by the Rules of their Law, if
the Woman can Re-imminate, and prove
her Husband guilty, in such a Case, they
must set the Fault of one against the
Fault of the other.</P>
<P>I wish the Doctor could have told you
the Offence had been equal; that the In∣jury
to Families had been equal: A Man,
by his Folly of this Kind, brings no spu∣rious
Issue to inherit the Lands of his
Wife, but the Woman deprives her Hus∣band
of any Legitimate Issue; for when
<PB N="273" REF="272"/>
she converses in this Manner with ano∣ther
Man, the Issue may be equally look'd
upon to be that Man's, if not more; and
this Lady hath kept this Conversation
ever since the Year Sixteen Hundred Eighty
Seven, and left the Duke.</P>
<P>One Thing is farther objected, and they
insist upon certain Articles of Agreement
in Ninety Four, and they read to you the
Preamble of them: Why Sir, The Articles
if they come to be read through, I am
sure it wont amount to what they pre∣tend;
it does not amount to this, That
she should live after her own Pleasure:
Indeed she was to have the Use of her
Houshold Goods, and Servants, and live
where she pleas'd, but that will not justify
her in her Way of Living.</P>
<P>Then to tell you, These are Matters of
a long standing; They are so, and of a long
Continuance; for if my Instructions prove
true, we shall prove this Scene of Adul∣tery
for matter of eight Years successively,
and that by Servants that were privy to
the Intrig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, who were sent away to <HI>Hol∣land;</HI>
but no sooner was the Bill baffled,
but the Man was sent for again, and the
same Conversation continu'd that was be∣tween
the Dutchess and Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI>
before he left <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The same was continu'd after he came
back to his Service in 1691, only they
<PB N="274" REF="273"/>
were something more cautious, and People
were not admitted so familiarly, to see
them in Bed together in 1692, and so it
continu'd 'till 1695.</P>
<P>They mention'd the Statute of Limi∣tations,
which was to put an End to
frivilous and vexatious Actions; but how
they can apply it to this Case, I can't see,
because a Man shall not bring frivilous
and vexatious Actions after a long Distance
of Time; therefore a Man shall not com∣plain,
when he hath receiv'd the greatest
Injury that can be done to Mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> They are kind to us again, in re∣commending
it to the Duke, to go into
the Spiritual Court 'till next Sessions; but
we think we are in a proper Method here
for that Relief which the Spiritual Court
cannot grant; and since we have so good
Reason to come here, if we prove the
Fact, I hope this High Court will not
send away a Complaint of this Nature,
without such Relief as is suitable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Northey.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am of the same Side.
I would beg Leave to say this, as to what
the Council have said in relation to the
Evidence, That there were three Witnesses
examin'd upon Oath, in the House of Peers,
before the Bill did pass there, and I be∣lieve
they are aware of that; and that
when you hear our Witnesses, there will
<PB N="275" REF="274"/>
be no Answer to be given on their Side;
and indeed the Witnesses they brought,
were so far from contradicting our Wit∣nesses,
that they did really confirm them.
But this is not the Case now; what our
Evidence is, or whether it be fit for you
to believe them, that will be when you
have heard them; and for the matter of
the Time, that you can't take Notice of
neither, 'till you hear our Evidence. But
this I may say, we shall bring a Man
that will speak to within four or five
Years.</P>
<P>But the Matter they apply themselves
to, which is material, is, Whether it is
proper for you to proceed upon this Bill;
that is, to give such a Relief as we desire,
by dissolving this Marriage. And in the
next Place, Whether this be a proper Time
to ask this Favour.</P>
<P>For the first, the Learned Doctor tells
you, 'tis not proper at any Time to do it;
for he would have the Canon-Law govern
here, as it does in their Courts. But the
Council, on the other Side, have cited you
several Precedents where it hath been done.
In the Case of the Marquis of <HI>Northampton,</HI>
the Second Marriage was contrary to the
Canon-Law, and yet that Marriage was
confirm'd according to God's Law. And
this Bill is to relieve against the Canon-Law.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="275"/>
Now, whether we are here in a proper
Time, Sir <HI>Thomas Powys</HI> has said a great
many Things, which may be proper to
many other Purposes. One Argument was,
because the Witnesses can't be upon Oath,
but that we know will not prevail in this
Place. In the next Place, they except, be∣cause
this Proceeding is in a summary Way,
I would know of them, Whether there is
not the same Objection to all Proceedings
before a Jury, That they have no Notice
what Witnesses will be produc'd.</P>
<P>Then in the next Place, they bring a
great Argument from the Recital of some
of these Bills, that there have been before
a Sentence in the Ecclesiastical Courts.
Now, 'tis true, they have been so in some
of those Cases; but I beg leave to observe,
That in the Case of the Marquis of <HI>Nor∣thampton,</HI>
the Bill was not to confirm the
Sentence, or to enable them to marry,
but to deliver them out of the Hands of
the Ecclesiastical Courts, who said, it was
not Lawful in that Case to marry; for
they were marry'd before.</P>
<P>I beg Leave to say, That in the Case of
my Lord <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> there was no Notice
in the Bill, that came down to you, of any
Proceedings in the Ecclesiastical Courts.
And I take this to be the Reason, because
there was no Sentence; though where there
was a Sentence, they had good Reason to
<PB N="277" REF="276"/>
take Notice of it. And I think there is as
much Certainty, and as good Ground to
proceed on this Bill, as in the other Case;
for the Witnesses have been already ex∣amin'd
in the House of Lords. In the
Case of my Lord <HI>Ross,</HI> there was no regard
to the Determination of the Ecclesiastical
Courts, as a Guide to the Parliament; and
it was look'd upon as of no Consequence,
for the Witnesses were examin'd again.</P>
<P>'Tis true, when we came before you
without such a Proceeding, we came under
this Disadvantage; you will be sure to
expect a plainer and fuller Proof; but for
that, we will undertake to make the Fact
so plain, that they can't give the least Pre∣tence
of Answer to it.</P>
<P>We are here asking that we can't have
any where else. Their great Design is
Delay, and that we have learn'd from the
Civilian, who tells you their Methods are
very grave and deliberate; and that they
may have a Commission to examine Wit∣nesses
beyond Sea, and that is to inquire
how their own Servants have liv'd beyond
Sea.</P>
<P>As to what Sir <HI>Thomas Powys</HI> would have,
that is, that we should go into the Spi∣ritual
Court, and apply our selves again
here next Sessions; I do not think the Le∣gislature
will send us back to ask that in
the Spiritual Court, which both have sub∣mitted
<PB N="278" REF="277"/>
to; for after the Duke had miscarry'd
in the Relief he sought by another Bill,
by the Dutchess's sending the Witnesses out
of the way, why, truly, after that, to
prevent any Prosecution in the Spiritual
Court, the Dutchess submitted to a Sepa∣ration
by Articles; and that was all the
Duke could have pretended to by the Ec∣clesiastical
Law; we follow her upon that,
and come to enforce that Separation, and
to make it effectual; and for that which
we humbly hope will be thought but Justice
to the Duke, that is, to be deliver'd from
this Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and to have Liberty to marry
again; we think there is no occasion for
Delay, and that no Body can be hurt by a
Precedent that carries Relief in this Na∣ture,
and delivers us from a Law, which,
in the Days of Popery was put upon us.
Upon the whole Matter, I hope you will
think that we are here very properly for
Relief, and that we shall have the Favour
to call our Witnesses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dr. <HI>Oldish.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, The great Objection a∣gainst
the passing of this Bill, was, be∣cause
Witnesses had not been examin'd in
the proper Court. 'Tis very true, general∣ly
speaking, in Cases it ought to be so, but
here is a very great Exception to that Rule,
and which I think can't admit of an Answer,
and that is the Notoriety of the Fact; and
in that Case they begin with Execution.
<PB N="279" REF="278"/>
And if that be so, I think there never was
a clearer Demonstration in the World; for
when formerly the Dutchess came to give
in her Answer, in the House of Lords, to
the Charge against her, she did declare,
That in the Year 83, or thereabouts, she
went out of <HI>England,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arry'd three Years,
and return'd about the Time of the <HI>Revolu∣tion.</HI>
And it does plainly appear there, be∣yond
all Question, that she was at <HI>Lam∣beth,</HI>
and went under the Name of the Lady
<HI>Becknam,</HI> and was attended by one <HI>Keemer,</HI>
who went then by the Name of <HI>Goodman:</HI>
Besides this, there are Witnesses that speak
to particular Facts. Now, I say, here is
that which amounts to Demonstration, and
where there is a Notoriety of Fact, that is,
an Exception out of the General Rule, and
'tis proper to begin with Execution.</P>
<P>There is an Exception to the General
Councils and Canons, that have been men∣tion'd,
That there shall not be a Divorce,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Sir, I say, it was an Ecclesiasti∣cal
Constitution, which was against the
Law of God, and 'tis demonstrably so; for
where our Saviour says, <HI>That a Man shall
not put away his Wife, except in Case of For∣nication;</HI>
it is plain, that in Case of Forni∣cation
he may.</P>
<P>There is another thing insisted on, and
that is, That there was a Reconciliation
between the Duke and his Dutchess. 'Tis
<PB N="280" REF="279"/>
true, a Reconciliation should drown all
Things before that Time; but when the Law
takes Notice in Case of a Relapse, that does
<HI>recrudescere,</HI> it rubs upon the old Sore; and
then that, which was before laid asleep, is
brought again upon the Stage, and will re∣turn
with greater Vengeance. And we have
plain Proof of her living in the same Man∣ner
since, as before.</P>
<P>But they would insinuate to you, That
in case there was a Tryal in the Ecclesi∣astical
Court, there might be a Recrimi∣nation;
but there must be a Compensation,
which can't be thought in this Case; for I
think in this Case, under Favour, there is
no Comparison. I don't think they are
<HI>Paria;</HI> for 'tis impossible for the Husband
to do that Injury as the Wife may; for
she may bring a Bastard into the Family,
and then the Estate does not go ac∣cording
to the Law of God and Nature;
for every Body desires his own Blood should
succeed him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Thomas Powys.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I shall say but
very little. But three or four Things have
been mention'd on the other Side, which
they offer, as if they conceiv'd them to have
great Weight, and yet they seem to me as
very capable of being answer'd; and I crave,
your Favour to do it.</P>
<P>They have gone much upon the Proofs
that they are ready to make, and I think
<PB N="281" REF="280"/>
not very properly, because we speak against
their Proceeding upon this Bill; but I am
sure it turns upon them, for according to their
own shewing, they are very well prepar'd
to proceed in regular Course; for they have
their Witnesses ready, and nothing does
obstruct them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Serg. Wright</HI> mention'd a Thing, which,
I must confess, I was surpris'd in; for when
I told him he could not find any Precedent
of such a Bill as this, without a previous
Preceeding in the Spiritual Court, Mr. <HI>Serg.
Wright</HI> said, it was quite otherwise; and,
to shew you it was so, he cited two Cases,
where there was no Marriage; now I al∣ways
understood a Divorce must be in any
Case where there was a Marriage; for the
Case of Mr. <HI>Knight</HI>'s, that was very lately;
that was the Case of an Infant, who they
pretended to have marry'd, <HI>infra Annos
nubiles;</HI> and therefore, says he, the decla∣ring
of that Marriage to be Null and Void
by Act of Parliament, was a Divorce. The
other was the Case of Mrs <HI>Wharton,</HI> which
was no Marriage neither, for Marriage must
be by Consent, and that was a Force; and
that he fancies to be a Case where there
was a Divorce too, without proceeding in
the Spiritual Court; and yet, of his own
shewing, it was no Marriage.</P>
<P>Another Thing I am much more surpris'd
at. We insisted, That they would not shew
<PB N="282" REF="281"/>
an Act for making a Divorce, without gi∣ving
the Party an Opportunity to make a
Defence; and the Doctor says, In com∣mon
Cases it ought to be so; and they
cited the Case of the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield</HI>
we first mention'd; and the Doctor told
you the Progress it had; and that there
was a full and regular Proceeding of great
Length of Time; and that my Lady <HI>Mac∣clesfield</HI>
had all her Witnesses examin'd;
and my Lord prosecuted her to an Excom∣munication,
which, is in Effect, a Sentence;
for it is in our Law, as in Case of Out∣lawry:
This he calls a Precedent, wherein
they proceeded to get an Act of Parlia∣ment,
without a previous Proceeding in
the Spiritual Court.</P>
<P>He tells you, in the next Place, That
notwithstanding the Divorce in the Case
of my Lord <HI>Ross,</HI> the Parliament did exa∣mine
Witnesses: 'Tis true, they did; for I
don't think they will so entirely pin their
Faith upon those Proceedings, as to have
no other Satisfaction. But will he there∣fore
say, they took no Notice of it, when
'tis the Foundation and Ground of the
Bill?</P>
<P>He tells you in the next Place, that the
Crime does not seem equal between the
one and the other; and so, in some sort,
they redicule the Doctor's Notion of Re∣crimination:
But I apprehend the Doctor
<PB N="283" REF="282"/>
is right in it; for it would be hard, if a
Man should marry a young Woman, and
give her an ill Example in his own Fami∣ly,
(I do not say 'tis in this Case) and bring
her acquainted with loose and ill Compa∣ny,
and by his Example or Provocation,
lead her into the same Offence. Would
that Man deserve to be rewarded with a
new Wife, and another Portion, because
his first Wife had only follow'd his Exam∣ple?</P>
<P>They say, The Offence is not equal, be∣cause
the Man brings no Children into the
Family.</P>
<P>I doubt it happens oftentimes to them
that go abroad, that they bring Home that
to their Wives, which sticks longer by them
than their Children.</P>
<P>Then to come and say, The Articles
can't be of any Use to us at all; and to
imagine, that we use the Articles so, that
the Dutchess might be at perfect Liberty
to live in Adultery: I wonder how that
Conceit hath follow'd him thither, when
we told him, We had not such a Thought,
as to live in Adultery; but they do direct
her to live separate; and so we us'd them
as an Answer to that Part; we us'd them
likewise as an Act of total Oblivion and
Remission of any thing beyond that Time;
and, I hope, to such Purposes, they shall
be thought sacred.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="283"/>
Now, I beseech you, Sir, on the whole
Matter, have they, on the other Side, said
one Thing, but what does totally tend to
bring all Cases of Adultery immediately
before you? Have they distinguish'd this
Case from the Case of any other Person?
And then, if they have not, I do not see,
from henceforward, that any but Fools
will go to the Ecclesiastical Courts for Re∣lief:
For, says the <HI>Serjeant,</HI> they cannot
give them a final Relief, and enable any
Person to marry again; and therefore, let
no Body think to go there again; but her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
is a Relief to be had worth a Man's having
But, I hope, we shall have the Benefit of
the Law, as it is, 'till you think fit to alter
it; and then you will erect some Judicature,
where People may have their Trial. Now▪
therefore, the Argument goes too far, or it
argues nothing at all; because, if there be
any thing in it, it goes to take away the
Proceedings of those Courts totally.</P>
<P>But tho' those Courts cannot do all that
these Gentlemen desire, they can do what
is very proper to be done. They can exa∣mine
Witnesses, and pronounce Sentence,
and give the Party a full Opportunity of
knowing the Accusation and Accusers;
and then the Cases, we have mention'd,
have had the Aid of an Act of Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="284"/>
Sir, We have spent a great deal of your
Time already: I hope, since you see what
Use they make of the last Precedent of
my Lord <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> where he did proceed
to an Excommunication; now from thence
they argue, that you should proceed ori∣ginally
in this Case. When is the Time to
make a Stand, but in the first Case? And
then no Man can complain of any Injury.
If you grant this to my Lord, I think,
in Justice, you cannot deny it to any other
that stands in need of it. I believe, there
never was the like before; and therefore, I
hope, you will put a Stop to it here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dodd.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Gentlemen on the o∣ther
Side have told you, that our Saviour
hath said, <HI>That no Man should put away his
Wife, except for Fornication.</HI> 'Tis true, the
Text is so; but he cannot shew you any
Text, wherein our Saviour says, That the
Man may marry again, tho' he might put
his Wife away. Another Thing was said,
as to the Proceeding in the Ecclesiastical
Courts Dr. <HI>Oldish</HI> says, There is to be nothing
but Execution, where there is a Notoriety
of Fact. And here the Fact is notorious;
and therefore you may come up to order
Execution: But that is a strange Doctrine
to our <HI>English</HI> Constitution. Would they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ang one first, and try him afterwards?
That would make Work. Let the Fact be
<PB N="286" REF="285"/>
never so notorious, yet 'tis the Right of all
the People of <HI>England</HI> to have a legal Try∣al;
and, I hope, you will not interpose,
'till there hath been a regular Tryal in an∣other
Place.</P>
<P>Then Sir <HI>Thomas Powys</HI> offer'd to produce

<P>The House resolv'd it self into a Committee
of the whole House, to consider of the Duke of
<HI>Nolfolk</HI>'s Bill.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Rowland Gwyne</HI> took the Chair of the
Committee of the whole House.</P>
<P>And the Council and Sollicitors were call'd
in, and the Bill read to them. And then Mr.
<HI>Northey,</HI> of Council with the Duke, open'd
the Evidence thus.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Northey.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I Am of Council for the Duke
of <HI>Norfolk.</HI> I shall not trou∣ble
you now (because I think it not fit) to
say any thing for the Bill, for that you
have approv'd of by Commitment of the
Bill; and declar'd it to be a reasonable and
just Relief against the Dutchess, for the
Adultery charg'd in the Bill. I shall not
spend any of your Time in aggravating
the Crime of Adultery.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="286"/>
But that which is incumbent on his
Grace's Council now, is to lay before you
the Proofs of the Fact suggested in the Bill.
And the Facts to be prov'd are the Intro∣duction
of the Bill; That the Dutchess has
liv'd for divers Years in Separation from
the Duke; and had unlawful Familiarity,
and adulterous Conversation with Sir <HI>John
Germaine:</HI> And for that Fact we will call
our Witnesses.</P>
<P>And our Evidence will make this out to
you, as plain as 'tis possible to expect a
Matter of this Nature to be prov'd.</P>
<P>However, I think they have manag'd
Things in that Manner, as we shall be
able to give as plain a Proof of these
Facts, as might be expected of those Acts
which are in their own Nature most pub∣lick.
However, in the Nature of the
Thing, there were but a few Persons to be
entrusted with it, and those were general∣ly
Servants who had Attendance on the
Dutchess's Person. We shall produce you
Servants, both of the Dutchess, and Sir
<HI>John Germaine.</HI> And, I hope, it cannot
be an Objection, That they are Servants;
for, to object to them, for that Reason, is
to say, You shall prove the Fact, but you
shall have no Witnesses; for these are
Facts that cannot be prov'd, but by such
as were concern'd with the Dutchess.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="287"/>
For our Evidence, it will fall out to be
this, The Duke and Dutchess were mar∣ry'd
in the Year 1677, and they liv'd to∣gether
'till about the Year 1685; and
then the Duke having some Account of
her Conversation of this Nature, they did
part, and afterwards she came to live open∣ly
with Sir <HI>John Germaine;</HI> for in <HI>May,
1689,</HI> the Witnesses will give you an Ac∣count,
that for two Months together she
lodg'd with Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI> at the Cock-pit;
and they liv'd there as Man and Wife,
as the Witnesses phrase it. During the
Time they liv'd there, there was a near
Relation of Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s, Mr. <HI>Da∣niel
Germaine</HI> his Brother, and Mrs. <HI>Briane</HI>
his Sister, did frequently come to the House;
and two of the Witnesses were frequently
in the Room while they were a-bed toge∣ther.</P>
<P>After two Months Time, the Dutchess
thought fit to be a little more private, and
it was given out she was gone to <HI>France;</HI>
but in Truth she remov'd to <HI>Fox-Hall,</HI> to
a House that was taken by Sir <HI>John Ger∣maine</HI>'s
Brother, and went by the Name of
my Lady <HI>Beckman;</HI> and she liv'd there
two Years successively; and Sir <HI>John Ger∣maine</HI>
came there frequently once or twice in
a Week, and lay there a-Nights. During
that Time, we have two Witnesses, that
did attend the Dutchess, as well as at the
<PB N="289" REF="288"/>
Cock-pit; one of them is <HI>Ellianor Vanesse,</HI>
who was hir'd by Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s Sister,
and liv'd with the Dutchess at the Cock-pit
two Months. We have a second Wit∣ness,
one <HI>Hauseur,</HI> who was with Sir <HI>John
Germaine</HI> at the Cock-pit 15 Days before the
Dutchess went to <HI>Vaux-Hall;</HI> and afterwards
he went to <HI>Vaux-Hall,</HI> when she remov'd
there, and stay'd with her all the two Years.</P>
<P>These are both Foreigners, and <HI>Dutch</HI>
People; and it was reasonable enough to
expect foreign Witnesses, when an <HI>English</HI>
Dutchess had a foreign Gallant. They are
such as he thought fit to entrust about
her.</P>
<P>After she had liv'd two Years at <HI>Vaux-Hall,</HI>
[this brings her to the Year 1691] she
remov'd Home again to her House at <HI>Mill∣bank;</HI>
and there Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI> and she
were frequently together, and have been
seen a-bed together.</P>
<P>This brings us to the Time when the
Duke having an Account that she had this
Conversation with Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI>
brought a Bill into the House of Peers for
a Divorce; but it happen'd, that the
Dutchess and Sir <HI>John Germaine,</HI> to avoid
the Condemnation, kept the Witnesses out of
the Way, and afterwards caus'd them to
be sent into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The Woman stay'd abroad 'till about
three Months ago; but the Man return'd
<PB N="290" REF="289"/>
before into Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s Service;
and he will give you an Account of what
Observations he made there, for the Fami∣liarity
continu'd between them then. He
was admitted into the Room where they
us'd to be; and he will give you an Ac∣count
how he hath seen them frequently
together. And he brings it down to with∣in
the Year 1695.</P>
<P>We have another Witness, one <HI>William
Bayley,</HI> who likewise was a Servant to Sir
<HI>John Germaine,</HI> and came into his Place
when <HI>Hauseur</HI> went beyond-Sea. He is an
unwilling Witness, because he hath been
preferr'd by Sir <HI>John Germaine:</HI> But when
he was upon his Oath in the other House,
he did give an Account, That while he
continu'd in Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI>'s Service,
notwithstanding this publick Reproach in
1695 and 1696, she frequently came to
Sir <HI>John Germain</HI>'s House, with one <HI>Keemer,</HI>
whom she had great Confidence in; and
one <HI>Susanna Barrington,</HI> I think yet in the
Dutchess's Service. And this Mr. <HI>Bayley</HI>
will give you an Account, That his Ma∣ster
was often from Home; and when he
was so, he us'd to carry his Linnen to this
<HI>Keemer,</HI> who was the Dutchess's Servant,
or this <HI>Keemer</HI> would come to him for it;
and this will bring it down to 1696.
There are several Witnesses to confirm this;
but we think, with Submission, after the
<PB N="291" REF="290"/>
Dutchess had been so accus'd in the House of
Lords of such a Familiarity, any Evidence
of a Conversation between them afterwards,
is as much as a thousand Witnesses; for no
Woman that valu'd her Reputation, having
been accus'd as she was, would have had any
Conversation with Sir <HI>John Germaine</HI> after∣wards.
But we don't want Circumstances
to support the Evidence of Fact: We have
as plain Evidence in this Case, as can be
expected in a Case of this Nature. We
will spend no more of your Time, but beg
Leave to call our Witnesses.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Atwood.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir <HI>Rowland Gwynne,</HI> please∣to
favour me a few Words on the same Side:
I shall not mispend the Time of the Com∣mittee,
in repeating any thing said by
Mr. <HI>Northey;</HI> I shall only observe, that
the Witnesses <HI>Hauseur</HI> and <HI>Vanesse</HI> say, That
<HI>Susanna Barrington</HI> was privy to this adul∣terous
Conversation; and this <HI>Susanna Bar∣rington</HI>
has withdrawn herself since the
Bill was depending in the House of Lords.</P>
<P>'Tis farther prov'd, That Mr. <HI>Daniel
Germaine</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brian</HI>'s Wife were in
<HI>England</HI> lately, and that these were privy
to the same Conversation.</P>
<P>Then the Witnesses were call'd in, one
by one, and Interpreters allow'd.</P>
<P>The Witnesses that were examin'd before
the Committee of the Commons, were, <HI>El∣lena
<PB N="292" REF="291"/>
lena Vanesse, Nicholas Hauseur, William Bay∣ley,</HI>
and <HI>Anne Read.</HI></P>
<P>But all, except <HI>Anne Read,</HI> were examin'd
in the House of Lords; and their Evidence
there being at large set forth, the Reader
is referr'd to the same. The Evidence of
<HI>Anne Read</HI> is as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Anne Read</HI> being ask'd, Whether she had
ever seen the Dutchess go to Sir <HI>John Ger∣maine</HI>'s
House, and when, says, That about
<HI>April 1692,</HI> (which was soon after the
Duke's Bill had been rejected in the House
of Lords) she saw the Dutchess of <HI>Norfolk</HI> go
in a Chair to Sir <HI>John</HI>'s House; that the
Door was immediately open'd upon her
Chair's being set down, and she went into
the House with her Mask off.</P>
<P>She being ask'd, Whether she had seen
Sir <HI>John</HI> come to the Dutchess's House, and
when; says, she, within a Twelve-month
last past, or thereabouts, follow'd him to
the Dutchess's House about three of the
Clock in the Afternoon, and that she did not
see him come out.</P>
<P>After the Witnesses were examin'd on the
Part of the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> for the Bill,
Sir <HI>Thomas Powys,</HI> of Council with the Dutch∣ess
of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> being call'd upon to make
Defence, spake to this Effect.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Powys.]</HI> I am at a Loss, Sir,
and under some kind of a Surprise, be∣cause,
<PB N="293" REF="292"/>
as far as I can apprehend, you call
upon us to make our Defence. I hope, in
a Case of such Moment as this is, (and, it
may be, there cannot be greater) and since
you are pleas'd to take this Case out of the
usual Way of Tryals, and to try it in the
first Instance, you will be pleas'd, that
we should be fairly and regularly heard;
and since it was not allow'd us, upon our
being heard against the Bill, that we should
have a Time to make our Defence. Now
we have heard what the Witnesses swear,
we shall desire but a short Time, no more
than what is absolutely necessary to make
our Defence. This hath spent us six Hours
already; and, I am sure, the Witnesses
that have been examin'd, have given such
Variety of Answers, that it doth afford a
great deal to be said to it. We have like∣wise
a good many Witnesses to be exa∣min'd;
but I am far from proposing any thing
to delay it. We had a Weeks Time
allow'd us in the House of Lords; but that
is no Rule for you, and we don't expect it
here. But even while we are at this Bar,
a Person from a very worthy Member, gives
us Intelligence, upon Sight of this Cook-Maid,
of a Matter that will defame her;
and he will be ready to make it out, that
she was turn'd away for being a common
Thief in <HI>Holland:</HI> And therefore, Sir, you
see how Time is necessary, in Point of Ac∣cidents
<PB N="294" REF="293"/>
that do happen; and I cannot make
our Defence now.</P>
<P>Thereupon the Council withdrew; and
the Committee having consider'd of the
Desire of the Council for the Dutchess, to
have Time allow'd them to make their De∣fence,
were of Opinion, That the Council
should proceed then to make their Defence;
and Candles were order'd to be brought
in.</P>
<P>And the Council being call'd in again,
Sir <HI>Rowland Gwynne,</HI> being in the Chair of
the Committee, acquainted them with the
Determination of the Committee.</P>
<P>Then Sir <HI>Thomas Powys</HI> observ'd upon the
Evidence that had been given, and insist∣ed,
that the Evidence given before the
Committee of Commons, did differ from
the Evidence given by them upon Oath in
the House of Lords; and offer'd to produce
the Examination of the said Witnesses up∣on
Oath in the House of Lords. And an
Objection being made, that such Examina∣tion
ought not to be read in that Case, as
Evidence before this Committee; the Coun∣cil
withdrew, and the Committee consider'd
of the said Objection, and were of Opi∣nion,
that the said Depositio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s should not
be read.</P>
<P>And Council being call'd in again, were
acquainted with it, and that if they had any

Witnesses, <HI>viva voce,</HI> to encounter their Evi∣dence,
they might produce them.</P>

any Good, if I bring a thousand other Wit∣nesses
against him. And therefore I pray
this Favour of you, That since 'tis your
Pleasure, that this Evidence be not allow'd,
you will not make a bad Construction of it,
that I do not proceed to make a Defence to
this Bill; for I cannot truly do it, unless I
had some other Instructions from my Client,
but shall defeat her Expectation, to proceed
upon the other Part of the Case; since what
we built upon with good Authority, as we
thought, is not thought fit to be admitted.</P>

it twice with very good Success, and
this is a third Time; and I would make
the best Defence this Case would bear now.
And I must own to you, that the Course of
our Evidence we did propose to our selves,

Solicitors or Agents, that were present
when these Witnesses were examin'd in the
House of Lords, prove what they swore
there.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Dodd.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We apprehend you have al∣ready
determin'd the Matter, and we can∣not
now meddle with it; but if I apprehend
it aright from the Chair, it is your Opi∣nion,
That we may produce the Solicitors
and Agents to give an Account of what
was sworn in the House of Lords. Now
we are under this Disability by your De∣termination,
That we, relying upon what
you have determin'd against us, are not
prepar'd with our Solicitors or others, to
give Evidence of that Matter; but in a
little Time they will be able to give you
an Account of what was then sworn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Atwood.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It seems they want to be
taught their Lesson.</P>
<P>And then the Council withdrew, and
the Committee proceeded upon the Bill,
Clause by Clause, and went through it,
and order'd the same to be reported.</P>
