<P>THE Editor of these Detached Scenes (the whole of which, except three or four of the Songs, were begun and finished in five Days) humbly presents them to an indulgent Public, in hopes of their excusing the many Errors with which so hasty a Performance must inevitably abound. — Conscious of a Deficiency in point of that <HI>critical Merit</HI> required in Dramatic Perfor∣mances, his utmost Wish will be accomplished, should the late Naval Review at Portsmouth have enabled him to furnish even the temporary Amuse∣ment of a leisure Hour.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Bell rings for the music to stop. A short silence ensues; then a man, with a book in his hand, supposed to be the Prompter, runs upon the stage, after Mr.</HI> Weston <HI>has been called upon two or three times behind the scenes.</HI></STAGE>

<L>I'm here. Don't you see me? What's all this about?</L>

<SPEAKER><HI>MAN.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir,—Who's to speak it?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>WESTON.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>To speak it,—why—who?</L>
<L>Go ask Mr. Foote, friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>MAN.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He says, Sir, 'tis you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>WESTON.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>He's mistaken, for once, I will venture to say,</L>
<L>'Tis a serious affair, and quite out of my way:</L>
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
<L>Sentimental, pathetical, tender, affecting,</L>
<L>Just like his last piece, and his new way of acting.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>MAN.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your speaking, I'm sure, Sir, would give it such grace.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>WESTON.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>It wou'd;—but who'll give me a tragedy face?—</L>
<L>I tell you, I neither like whining nor ranting,</L>
<L>The groanings and tonings of tragedy canting;</L>
<L>To sigh, and to strut, and to start, and to stare,</L>
<L>My arms throw about, up and down, here and there;</L>
<L>Kick my train in a pet, and with passionate rumble,</L>
<L>Make sun, moon, and stars, a bombastical jumble;</L>
<L>'Till quite out of breath with heroical swagger,</L>
<L>The poison bowl enters, or polish'd tin dagger:</L>
<L>Then quivering I fall, or in simile die,</L>
<L><HI>So, so,</HI> or <HI>as if,</HI> or <HI>as when,</HI> or <HI>as why,</HI></L>
<L>Ti, ti, tum, Ti, ti, tum, Tum, tum, tum, Ti, ti.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>WESTON.</HI></SPEAKER>

<L>I don't like it,—that's all I've to say,</L>
<L>So pray take yourself and the Prologue away.</L>
<STAGE><HI>[Exit MAN, leaving WESTON.]</HI></STAGE>
<L>So now I am Solus, that is, I'm alone,</L>
<L>Suppose I shou'd try at a speech of my own—</L>
<L>An extempore Prologue—The fancy is new—</L>
<L>With your leaves, you shall judge what <HI>Tom Weston</HI> can do.—</L>

<L>Once on a time, tho' 'twas in Shakespear's days,</L>
<L>Nature and common sense embellish'd play;</L>
<L>Before old English humour turn'd buffoon,</L>
<L>And long e'er Op'ras put wit out of tune.</L>
<L>In that same time, folks did not think by rules,</L>
<L>But as they felt, they spoke—Our fathers were no fools.</L>
<L>Their song was, <HI>Mirth admit me of your crew:</HI></L>
<L>But that's all old—'tisn't the thing—'twont do,</L>
<L>The ton is now,—we must have something new.</L>
<L>New sights we've had, new grand Illuminations,</L>
<L>With Jubilees, and Trips, and Installations.—</L>
<L>We have a trip to-night, to shew some shipping;</L>
<L>Suppose the Author is to-night caught tripping?—</L>
<L>These same Play-jobbers, though it is surprizing,</L>
<L>Will always send me on, apologizing.</L>
<L>Thus they come o'er me: <HI>Weston, you're a Soul!</HI></L>
<L><HI>Do speak my Prologue—you're so dry and droll.</HI></L>
<L>I must go on then—I'm serv'd so this night,</L>
<L>As common bail for what bad Poets write.</L>
<L>If—but I hope not—If we're brought to shame,</L>
<L>If you the Author, or the Actors blame,</L>
<L>May we in one request, good Sirs, be friended,</L>
<L>Pray don't give sentence till the piece is ended.</L>

<P>My dear Sir Flimsey, how can you put yourself into such a passion? It was none of the poor fel∣low's fault.</P>

<P>No, indeed, your honour—</P>

<P>Hold your tongue, fellow;—are not you frighted, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> FLIRT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! no, not I indeed. Why the chaise went over as if it had been done for the purpose, and so softly, and took so much time before it tumbled: and then, Sir Flimsey, how you look'd, as if you had been a ghost. I could not help laughing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> FLIMSEY.</SPEAKER>

<P>Ought I? but I won't tho'. I never did consider, and I won't begin now. Pray did we come to Ports∣mouth for consideration-sake? Not we, truly. We came out upon a party of pleasure, and pleasure I will have, if I go to sea myself for it. If you must consider, pray consider how the postillion is to get the chaise up again. I see William, our man, stands by the horses.</P>

<P>Lord, don't scold so. Go along, Postillion, and bid my man give half a crown to some of the peo∣ple that are passing along, to help you. You'll soon get it up again, and see if it is not damaged; we'll walk through the field, and get in again at that stile yonder. We are just by Portsmouth, an't we?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> FLIMSEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder, Betsey, how you can encourage such negligent rascals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss</HI> FLIRT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder how you can say so. But you are as fretful as if you had the tooth-ach. You put one in mind of those travellers who begin a journey out of humour, and are resolved not to be pleas'd with any thing; and when they come back, give the country a bad character, merely to indulge their own ill tempers.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a very pretty time to put yourself in a passion, and the whole house into confusion; and now, in about an hour's time, when the people come back, who are gone to meet his Majesty, and the town fills, we shall have nothing ready.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANLADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but we shall have every thing ready. But would it not vex any body to hear you talk of not raising the prices of your things? Shall we ever have such another opportunity? Such a sight as this may never happen here again: and we should make hay while the sun shines. Don't we pay the King many taxes, and why may we not tax the people, who come to see his Majesty? And so then we may say, in a manner, as how, the King makes his subjects pay us again.</P>

<P>Your conscience? what has a publican to do with conscience? mind your business; and put con∣science behind the bar-board: I say conscience, truly. I wonder how many fine equipages we should wait upon, if their keepers had always stood upon con∣science.</P>

<P>Why, my dear, we must live after this show is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, and so we must, and this is the way to do it. People that come down here expect to pay dear for every thing they have; and besides, most of um are Londoners, and you know they never mind what they do with their money, if they can see any thing strange for it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GROANLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as spirituous liquors are unwholesome li∣quors, the less you sell your customers, the less harm they can receive; for you hinder them from drink∣ing too much, by taking care to give them too little.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> FLIMSEY.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> FLIMSEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, bring us a bottle of Champaign. <STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Landlord.]</STAGE> In this peaceable time, people pray here for a war; and I don't doubt but in a very healthy time, physicians pray for a plague. It is something rather on the wrong side of humanity to help ourselves by hurting our neighbours; how∣ever, as my landlord says, it is very natural tho'— and yet we pretend to be a civilized people.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Landlord <HI>with wine.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Well, landlord, how long will it be before his Majesty comes?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>We expect the King in about an hour's time, sir; all the people of our town are gone beyond the Fortifications to meet him; and that makes <HI>Ports∣mouth</HI> so quiet at present. Sir, your Honour's health: I think I never saw your Honour look better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> FLIMSEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, landlord, I'm grown young again. I have been dipped in Medea's kettle. A fine girl is the grand elixir of life, the chief restorative, and na∣ture's supernaculum; and I have got the sweetest wench in the world; so mild, so affable, none of
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>the haughty airs of matrimony. I have all the sweets of wedlock without any of the bitters. All roses without thorns.—A wife! damn it, mine was insupportable. I was forced to part with her. So domineering, such a vixen, and so costly, she would have ruined me. Now this girl checks me when I would give her any thing. She refused a service of plate that I offered her to-day. She said it was too expensive. Now I never indeed proffer'd to give my wife such a thing; but if I had, she would have took it, yes, yes, yes, she wou'd have taken it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir: No offence, I hope; Is Lady Ner∣vous in town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> FLIMSEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know. I never enquire after her. She made me toss her in two hundred pounds per ann. more when we parted: She bullied me into it— She was a perfect tyrant. Now this girl is as mild as a lamb, tender as a turtle, and no more haughti∣ness in her than in a milk-maid. I never did a better thing than parting from Lady Nervous. And, I am certain that married men of fashion will never live happy, until they have sense and spirit enough to make their wives live upon the board wages of a separate maintenance.</P>

<P>And I shall be always glad to see you, Sir Flim-sey,—But, Lord, what a place this is! Mercy upon us! the people are all mad: why the roads are lined with men, women, and children; the hills, and the hedges, and the trees, and the tops of the houses, and the chimney tops, and upon the walls, and out of the windows, all staring and gaping, like peeping Tom of Coventry.

<SPEAKER><HI>Old</HI> INKLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You gentlemen of fortune, indeed, may think pleasure an employment, but we people in trade must look after labour; and we may look, and look again, its all over with us: what with inclo∣sures, and lotteries, and masquerades; though, to be sure, masquerades did help trade a little, and then they wanted to put them down, as if they had not a mind to permit any thing that was for the good of this country.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Old</HI> INKLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pretty well, pretty well, Sir. I might have done better if we could have got an act of parlia∣ment for Masquerades. But no, I will say that for them, nothing for the good of Old England. I don't know what will become of us for my part,—
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>hurrying here, driving there, post chaises rattling to the sea-water as if all the world wanted dipping, —then, all in a hurry to Portsmouth, next to Ox∣ford, and next to—I wonder where they'll go next. Lord, have mercy upon us! I warrant now my son would as soon turn papist, as ramble to any of these raree-shows. No, no, he's busy at home, I'm sure, posting his books, copying letters, or taking an account of stock. He hates going to these sights as much as I do.</P>

<P>No; but it is not block and block with my shoulder as it us'd to be, — for going to see father, he ax'd me to take a voyage a hunting with him, —so, when the swabber rigg'd the horses, they brought me one to stow myself on board, that they told me was in such right and tight trim, that she would go upon any tack as fast as a Folkstone cutter.</P>
