<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Design of this Pam∣phlet
is to shew; First,
That King <HI>Tibbald</HI> is
justly depos'd from being
King of Dunces, and Prince <HI>Alexan∣der</HI>
advanced to the Throne by Right
Hereditary and Right of Merit.</P>
<P>That King <HI>Tibbald</HI> is incapacitated
to hold an Empire of that unbounded
Extent, by some unfortunate Qualities,
as Learning, Judgment, Sagacity, and
that Modesty which always attends
Merit.</P>
<P>That Prince <HI>Alexander</HI> is highly
Qualify'd for that supream Office, by
<PB REF="5"/>
an Impudence which always accompanies
Stupidity, and an Ignorance as gross
as the old <HI>Egyptian</HI> Darkness.</P>
<P>That his Ignorance is shewn par∣ticularly
by attacking several Persons
of a Hundred times greater Merit
than himself; and who had given him
no Provocation, but by surpassing him.
And if Persons must be Dunces who
vastly surpass him, what must he be
who is so vastly surpass'd? Surely of
the Number of the Fools of Nature.</P>
<P>That his Ignorance in other Mat∣ters
must be very wonderful, since it
appears, that he is utterly ignorant of
an Art, which he has profess'd all his
Life-time, and that is of Poetry, and
particularly Epick Poetry.</P>
<P>That this gross Ignorance will ap∣pear
by his Practice in the Beastly
<HI>Dunciad,</HI></P>
<P>And by his Speculations in the Pre∣face
to his Translation of the <HI>Iliad,</HI></P>
<P>And by his never having writ any
thing that had either any moral Mean∣ing,
<PB REF="6"/>
or any just Design; which has
been often shewn.</P>
<P>That as he is ignorant of the Art
of Poetry, and particularly of Epick
Poetry, he is profoundly ignorant of
<HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Boileau;</HI> to
which latter he very impudently com∣pares
himself, and more impudently
prefers himself.</P>
<P>That there are Ten important Dif∣ferences,
which distinguish <HI>Boileau</HI> from
him.</P>
<P>Secondly, That as Prince <HI>Alexander</HI>
is qualify'd to be Sovereign Prince of
Dunces, he is highly qualify'd to be
King of Kn—; there being no other
Difference between the greatest of Fools
and the greatest of Kn—, than there
is between High Probability and Mat∣ter
of Fact; Reason and good Sense
being, next to Religion, the greatest
Restraints upon Mankind, and the
purest Sources of Probity, Integrity,
and Sincerity.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
That he is qualify'd for this impor∣tant
Office, is shewn,</P>
<P>By his unparallel'd Impudence. For
as Modesty, which is itself a moral
Virtue, always accompanies the other
Virtues; great Impudence always attends
great Kn—ry; as villainous
Calumnies, audacious Lyes, accusing in∣nocent
Persons of the Accuser's Crimes,
on purpose to make Men of Sense look
little to Fools, and shallow Knaves.</P>
<P>Divers of these Calumnies, and these
infamous Falshoods, are discover'd and
expos'd in this Pamphlet, by several
Original Letters, either attesting undeniable
Facts, or confounding impudent
Calumnies.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS
Upon Mr. POPE's
DUNCIAD.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>To Mr. LEWIS THEOBALD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE lately read over the Two
Letters which were writ by you,
and published in the <HI>Daily Jour∣nals,</HI>
and return you my hearty
Thanks for the Pleasure which I
receiv'd from them. I observed in those Letters
an extraordinary Piece of Gratitude in you, in
resigning that Throne to <HI>P.</HI> to which he him∣self
had advanced you, with Ten times more
Goodness on his Side than Desert on yours.
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
And it was no small Satisfaction to me, to
find that you were govern'd so entirely by
Justice, as to part with an Empire of so un∣bounded
an Extent, to one who had Right
Divine to it, who had by Nature an He∣reditary
Indefeasible Right to succeed <HI>Tom
D'Urfey</HI> and <HI>Settle.</HI> One certain Sign of his
being even born to be no less than absolute
Monarch of all the Dunces over the whole
Face of the Earth, was his conferring that
Title on you, who have unfortunate Qualities
that are so incompatible with it, as Modesty,
Humanity, Discernment, Penetration, Sagacity,
together with an uncommon Knowledge of
Letters, and Skill in the learned Languages:
These are Talents which utterly unqualify you
to govern a Generation of Mortals, who are
not influenced by any of them, and who
have not the least Notion of some of them.
Whereas <HI>P.</HI> has one Qualification alone, which
gives him an indisputable Right to wear the
Imperial Crown of the Dunces; and that is,
that soaring matchless Impudence, begot by
Pride on Stupidity, which strikes so strongly
on the outward Senses, by which Dunces are
entirely govern'd. Whereas Genius, and Wit,
and Learning, and Truth, and Sense, and De∣corum,
speak forcibly only to the understand∣ing
Few, and have Power over them alone.
That high and undaunted Assurance qualified
him to set up for an Editor, in spite of Learn∣ing,
or Art, or Nature, as you have so clearly
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
shewn; and that qualified him to set up for
a Versifier, without Numbers; and for a Cri∣tick,
without Taste or Judgment; as I for∣merly
shew'd so clearly: That soaring and
matchless Impudence also gave him plenary
Power, to throw out his Titles to the Right
and the Left, without any Discernment or
Distinction. So that Persons whom God and
Nature have plac'd immense Degrees above
him, are dubb'd, by him, Fools, Blockheads,
Dunces, and Scoundrels, according to his So∣vereign
Pleasure; which puts me in mind of
a little Gentleman, who was in the Court of
one of our Kings, a Wit, just such a Wit
as Mr. <HI>P.</HI> is in the Reign of King <HI>G.</HI> II.
This motley Gentleman was wont to salute
every one whom he met in the Morning,
with <HI>Good-morrow, Brother Fool,</HI> whether it
was Bishop or Archbishop, or President of the
Council, or Secretary of State, which often
caus'd his lower Parts rudely to suffer for
the Licentiousness of the Parts above them.
And I wish Mr. <HI>P.</HI> had been so happy as to
take Warning by that Example:
<Q>Faelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</Q></P>
<P>It was long before I had the Happiness to
be acquainted with you, who were then very
young, that I publish'd Remarks upon the
Translation of the <HI>Iliad</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> by <HI>P.</HI>
upon his <HI>Windsor Forest,</HI> writ in Envy of Sir
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
<HI>John Denham</HI>'s Poem upon <HI>Cooper</HI>'s <HI>Hill;</HI>
upon the infamous <HI>Temple of Fame,</HI> writ in
Envy of <HI>Chaucer</HI>'s Poem upon the same Sub∣ject;
and upon the Ode on <HI>Caecilia</HI>'s Day,
writ in Envy of Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Feast of <HI>Alex∣ander;</HI>
an Ode in which <HI>P.</HI> very wisely pre∣tends
to shew the Power of Musick, by the
Story of <HI>Orph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us;</HI> that is, by an Allegory.
For <HI>Horace,</HI> who may be allow'd to be a pretty
good Judge of this Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, tells us, that the
whole Story of <HI>Orpheus</HI> is nothing but an
Allegory:
<Q><L>Sylvestres homines sacer interpresque Deorum</L>
<L>Caedibus, &amp; v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctu foedo det<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Orpheus;</L>
<L>Dictus ob hoc lenire tigres rapidosque leones.</L></Q></P>
<P>And my Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon,</HI> in his Trea∣tise
of the Wisdom of the Antients, is of the
same Opinion.</P>
<P>As I have lately perused all the 'foresaid
Remarks, and some of them after a very long
Distance of Time from the first writing and
publishing them; so that the warm and partial
Conceit of an Author had been a long time
extinguish'd: As I have not only done this,
but consulted likewise my sincerest and most
judicious Friends, both they and I have found,
that the Remarks which I submitted to their
Censure▪ were reasonable, just, and solid, and
consequently that the Pieces on which they
were writ, were infinitely below the Master∣pieces,
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
in Envy of which they were published
by their scandalous Author.</P>
<P>Now, as <HI>P.</HI> apparently wrote the 'for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>said
Pieces, in Envy to the Reputation of their
celebrated Authors, neither you nor I can have
any R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ason to doubt, but that if those Au∣thors
had been his Contemporaries, if Time
and Death, and impartial Posterity had not
given a Sanction to their Writings, he would
have put all of them into the Number of his
Dunces. For either he must have resolved to
be a Foil to them, which his monstrous and
impudent Vanity will not let us suppose, or
he must have believed that he could surpass
them, and consequently we must conclude,
that instead of You, he would have placed
<HI>Dryden,</HI> or <HI>Denham,</HI> or <HI>Waller,</HI> if they had
been now alive, upon the Imperial Throne of
his Dunces.</P>
<P>As in making these Remarks, I have en∣deavour'd
to shew him an Author without
Judgment, or without any thing of that good
Sense, which, if we will believe <HI>Horace,</HI> is
the only Source of good Writing in Poetry:
<Q>Scribendi recte sapere est &amp; pincipium &amp;
fons;</Q>
Nay, without any Degree of reasonable Mean∣ing:
I shall, in sending you Remarks upon
some of the prosaick Parts of the Edition of
his late Rhapsody in <HI>Quarto,</HI> [for the Rhimes
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
by their own Vileness are secur'd from Criti∣cism,]
endeavour to lay before you, not only
his utter Ignorance of the poetical Art, but
his Malice, his Impudence, his Falshood, and
his want of Honour.</P>
<P>But now, Sir, to come to the Prelimina∣ries
before his Rhapsody, both that before the
Volume in Twelves, and that before the other
in <HI>Quarto:</HI> Oh, the Truth, the Wisdom, the
Modesty, the Humility that there is to be found
in both! As he formerly writ Rhimes in his
own Commendation, and publish'd Mr. <HI>Wy∣cherley</HI>'s
Name to them, he has now been
dabbling after the same Manner in Prose. He
has before each of these Volumes writ his own
fulsome Panegyricks: And each of these sul∣some
Panegyricks is pretended to be writ by
others, forsooth, without the least Knowledge
or Privacy of this modest Author. Now, Sir,
either he imagines, that he can make the im∣partial
World believe this, or he does not.
If he does not imagine that he can impose this
upon the sensible and impartial World, to
what End or Purpose is this noble Fiction?
Was it to convince his sensible Readers, that
he can out-equivocate, and out-prevaricate the
pontifical Scaramouchi, from whom he had
his Education and Instruction? or was it con∣triv'd
to make some Addition to the Hundred
thousand Fools, who, he says, already admire
him? But if he does imagine that he can im∣pose
this Falshood upon the sensible and impar∣tial
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
World, can there be a more certain Sign
that he has made you an Usurper, and plac'd
you upon a Throne to which he himself has
an indefeasible Right? Was there ever such an
empty, such an impudent Scribler? Did ever
any fanatical <HI>Aegyptian</HI> of old offer more
Incense to one of Pug's Ancestors, than Pug
has offer'd to himself, who is at once the Vo∣tary
and the Priest, and a little mimicking,
mischievous, ludicrous God upon the Altar?</P>
<P>That he was the Author of both these Pre∣liminaries,
is not only a Truth that is in itself
apparent, and that carries its own Evidence
with it; but 'tis known to half the Town,
that he carried or sent both these Panegyricks
to the Press himself. That the lat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er was
printed by one <HI>Wr—t,</HI> who was formerly
Operator to Alderman <HI>B—,</HI> and who
lives in a Place call'd <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Hill,</HI> between
<HI>Doctors-Commons</HI> and the <HI>Thames,</HI> a Place
in which this Poetaster exceedingly delights,
because he has in the Neighbourhood of it,
like his Brother Proctor <HI>John Littlewit,
Addle Hill</HI> for his <HI>Parnassus,</HI> and <HI>Puddle-Dock</HI>
for his <HI>Hippocrene;</HI> by drinking large
Draughts of which latter, he was inspir'd with
that cleanly, that noble, that gallant Inven∣tion
of <HI>Fleet-Ditch;</HI> an Invention so fit to
entertain and charm the most delicate Persons
of both Sexes. Does not half the Town
know, that honest <HI>J. W.</HI> was the only
Dunce that was persecuted and plagu'd by this
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
Impression? that Twenty times the Rhapsodist
alter'd every thing that he gave the Printer?
and that Twenty times, <HI>W.</HI> in Rage and in
Fury, threaten'd to turn the <HI>Rhapsody</HI> back
upon the Rhapsodist's Hands?</P>
<P>Give me Leave, Sir, to say something apart
to each of these two Preliminaries, both to
that in Twelves, and to that in <HI>Quarto.</HI> I
shall begin with the former, which is super∣scrib'd,
<HI>The Publisher to the Reader.</HI> The
first extraordinary Paragraph in it, has two ge∣neral
Assertions, which, generally taken, are
false, and which the Author, to shew his Lo∣gical
Head, is for proving true by a particular
Instance, and, to shew his great Modesty, takes
that Instance from himself. The first general
Assertion is, <HI>That, when any Scandal is vented
against a Man of the highest Distinction and
Charact<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, either in the State or in Litera∣ture,
the Publick in general afford it a quiet
Reception, and the larger Part accept it as
favourably, as if it were some Kindness done
to themselves.</HI> This is the first general Asser∣tion.
Now, Sir, for the particular Instance
intended to prove the Truth of it; <HI>I will
only observe one Fact,</HI> says <HI>P. that every Week
for th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Two Months past, the Town has
been p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsecuted with Pamphlets, Advertise∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts,
L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tters, and weekly Essays, not only
against my Wit and Writings, who am a Man
of the highest Distinction and Character in
Literature, but against my Person and Cha∣racter.
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
And that of all those Men who have
received Pleasure from my Writings, which
by a modest Computation</HI> [Oh! the charming
Beauties of that attractive Virtue, Modesty!]
<HI>may be about a Hundred thousand in these
Kingdoms of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>not to men∣tion</HI>
Jersey <HI>and</HI> Guernsey, [<HI>which you know,
says</HI> P. <HI>are not in</HI> England, <HI>because they are
in</HI> Hampshire,] <HI>or the</HI> Orcades, [<HI>which I men∣tion
without naming</HI> Scotland, <HI>sweetly to in∣sinuate,
that there is no such thing as Taste
of Literature in any Part of</HI> North-Britain,
<HI>unless in that which is next to</HI> Greenland,]
<HI>or the new World, or Foreigners who have
translated me into their Languages, not a
Man among them has stood up to say one Word
in my Defence.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I laid before you the first
general Assertion, and the particular Instance
intended to prove the Truth of it. But now,
Sir, as I observ'd before, <HI>P</HI>'s undistinguishing
Noddle has not found out, that his first gene∣ral
Assertion, generally taken, is false; for if
by a Man of the highest Distinction and Cha∣racter,
he means one who has highly deserv'd
either of his Country or of the Common∣wealth
of Learning, [But then he must not in
anywise mean himself, who has deserved no∣thing
of the latter, and very ill of the former] I
may justly affirm, that any Scandal or Calum∣ny
published against such a one, must be ut∣terly
shocking to any Man of good Sense, or
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
Candour, or Integrity, or Humanity, though
perhaps it may be pleasing enough to <HI>P</HI>'s Hun∣dred
thousand Admirers: For People of their
Capacities are always Levellers, and when they
find it impossible for them to raise themselves
to an Equality with Merit, they politickly lay
hold of any Opportunity to bring Merit down
to their Level.</P>
<P>Thus have I shewn that this first general As∣sertion
is not prov'd by the particular Instance,
not only because no general Conclusion can be
drawn from Particulars, but because the Person
mention'd in the general Assertion is immensely
distant from the Creature mention'd in the
particular Instance; as distinct as East from
West, or as Earth from Heaven. For if <HI>P.</HI>
has the Misfortune to fancy himself <HI>a Person
of the highest Distinction and Character in
Literature,</HI> as he plainly infers that he does,
his Pericranium is certainly as much out of
Order, and he as much wants to be trepann'd,
as if he had declar'd himself <HI>Grand Signior,</HI>
Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> or the <HI>Great Mogul.</HI></P>
<P>But now to come to the second general As∣sertion,
which is a blessed one, and is as fol∣lows:
<HI>If a known Scoundrel or Blockhead
chance to be but touch'd upon, a whole Legion
is up in Arms, and it becomes the common
Cause of all Scriblers, Printers, and Book∣sellers
whatsoever.</HI> Now the particular In∣stance
or Fact gives the Lye to this general
Assertion. For a certain known Scoundrel,
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
and horrible Blockhead, has lately not only
been touch'd upon, but dwelt upon, and has
been pelted as much and as plentifully as if
his Ears had been nail'd to the Pillory, and
yet not one of all his Hundred thousand Ad∣mirers,
whether in <HI>Jersey</HI> or <HI>Guernsey,</HI> or the
<HI>Orcades,</HI> or in the new World, not any Man
has stood up to say one Word in his Defence.</P>
<P>I hope this will convince his Patrons and
his Admirers, who have purchas'd Scurrility
and Nonsense at so dear a Rate, that nothing
is more easy than to give foul Language, but
that 'tis Ten times more excusable in Me than
it is in Him; first, because <HI>laesit prior,</HI> I only
retort the Language he gave; secondly, because
in the Remarks which I formerly made upon
the several Things he has publish'd, I have
given such Reasons, why this Language is his
Due, as have convinc'd every sensible impar∣tial
Reader, that there is not in any of those
Trifles the least Degree of that Solidity, that
Morality, and that good Sense, which are
the Principles and Fountain of all good Wri∣ting
in Poetry: I shall pursue the same Method
in the Animadversions, which from time to
time I shall send you upon the brutal <HI>Dunciad;</HI>
and before I have done with this first Prelimi∣nary,
I shall take one Occasion from it, to
convince the Reader, that this bouncing Bully
of <HI>Parnassus,</HI> is nothing but a false Brave,
a mere bragging pretending Empirick, and
utterly ignorant of the first Rudiments of an
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
Art which he has more than Twenty Years
professed, and in which he has nothing but
Impudence and Ignorance, and Falshood to
support him.</P>
<P><HI>In order to shew this, let us see the Account
that</HI> P. <HI>himself gives of his</HI> Dunciad. It is
stil'd, <HI>says be,</HI> Heroick, as being doubly so, not only
with respect to its Nature, which according
to the best Rules of the Antients, and strictest
Ideas of the Moderns, is critically such; but
also with regard to the heroical Disposition,
and high Courage of the Writer, who dar'd to
stir up such a formidable, irritable, and im∣placable
Race of Mortals.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>P.</HI> all at once makes himself the
Hero of his wonderful Rhapsody, and stiles
his Folly, his Impudence, his Insolence, and
his want of Capacity to discern and to distin∣guish,
high Courage; for want of which Ca∣pacity,
he must be told, that a Bully is of all
Mortals, the most Foolish, the most Impudent,
and the most Insolent, but at the same time
Cowardly. And here, Sir, give me leave to
observe what the scandalous Chronicle reports,
That as soon as the Rhapsody was publish'd,
<HI>P.</HI> never dar'd to appear without a tall <HI>Irishman</HI>
attending him, who is so inseparable from
him, that one would swear that he owes his
Wit as well as his Courage to him.</P>
<P>But there is now a Necessity for going back
a little, <HI>The</HI> Dunciad, <HI>says</HI> P, <HI>is stiled Heroick
with respect to its Nature, which, according to the
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
best Rules of the Antients, and strictest Ideas
of the Moderns, is critically such.</HI> Here then
let us see what the Proposition of every Epick
Poem, whether Serious and Real, or Mock
and Ridiculous, ought to be; and then whether
<HI>P</HI>'s Proposition is agreeable to it.</P>
<P>The Proposition of an Epick Poem, <HI>says Bossu,</HI>
is, That first Part of the Poem, in which the
Author proposes briefly, and in general, what
he designs to say in the Body of his Work; in
which there are two Things to be considered,
the one is what the Poet proposes, and the
other is the Manner of his proposing it.</P>
<P>The Proposition, <HI>continues he,</HI> ought to
contain the Matter of the Poem only; that is
to say, the Action of it, and the Persons who
execute that Action, whether those Persons
are Divine or Human: We find all that in
the <HI>Iliad,</HI> in the <HI>Odysses,</HI> and in the <HI>Aeneid.</HI></P>
<P>The Action that <HI>Homer</HI> proposes to sing in
the <HI>Iliad,</HI> is the Revenge that <HI>Achilles</HI> takes
for the Affront that is offered him; that of
the <HI>Odysses</HI> is the Return of <HI>Ulysses</HI> to <HI>Ithaca;</HI>
and that of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> is the Empire of
<HI>Troy</HI> transferr'd by <HI>Aeneas</HI> to <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>We ought not to suff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r ourselves to be sur∣prized
by the Expression of <HI>Homer</HI> in the Begin∣ning
of his <HI>Iliad,</HI> where he says that he sings
the pernicious Wrath of <HI>Achilles,</HI> nor believe
that he proposes that Wrath as the Subject of
his Poem: At that rate he could not relate an
Action to his Reader, but a Passion; We ought
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
not to stop there, since he himself has not stopp'd
there. He tells us, that he sings the Wrath
which caus'd the <HI>Greeks</HI> to suffer such mighty
Losses, and was the Death of so many Heroes.
He proposes then an Action, and not a simple
Passion for the Matter of his Poem; and that
Action is, as we said before, the Revenge that
<HI>Achilles</HI> takes for the Affront that is offered
him.</P>
<P>Thus in the other two Poems, they propose
at first a Man; but the Propositions stop not
there, they add, that <HI>Ulysses</HI> suffered very much
in his Endeavour to return into his Country,
or that the Design of <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Voyage was to
establish himself in <HI>Italy.</HI> Both the one and
the other, then, of the two Poets proposes to
sing an Action.</P>
<P>But so much for serious and real Epick or
Heroick Poems. Let us now come to the
Mock and the Comick ones, and we shall find,
that this Poem, by changing its Nature, does
not change its Manner. <HI>Boileau,</HI> who was
one of the greatest of the <HI>French</HI> Poets, and
one of the most judicious of their Criticks,
calls his <HI>Lutrin, Poeme Heroique,</HI> an Heroical
or Epick Poem; and yet in the Proposition
to this Poem, which was designed purely for
Pleasantry, he proposes to sing an Action, as
appears by the Proposition itself.</P>
<Q><L>Je Chante les combats, et ce Prelat terrible,</L>
<L>Qui par ses long Travaux et sa Force invincible,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="22"/>
Dans une illustre Eglise exercant son grand coeur</L>
<L>Fit placer a la fin un Lutrin dans le Choeur.</L>
<L>Cest en vain que le Chantre appuié d'un vain Titre,</L>
<L>Deux fois l'enfit oter par les mains du Chapitre;</L>
<L>Ce Prelat sur le Banc de son Rival altier</L>
<L>Deux fois le rapportant l'en couvrit tout entier.</L></Q>
<P>Which in <HI>English</HI> Prose is thus,</P>
<P>I sing the Combats, and that terrible Pre∣late,
who, by his long Labours, and his invin∣cible
Courage, causing his great Soul to be seen
by his Actions, in an illustrious Church, caused
at length a stately Pulpit to be erected in the
Choir. In vain did the Chanter, supported by
an empty Title, twice cause it to be taken down
by the Hands of the Chapter; and twice did
the Prelate, causing it to be carried back again,
fix it before the Seat of his proud Rival, and
covering him, and hiding him from the Con∣gregation,
mortify him severely.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Boileau,</HI> in the Proposition to a mock
Epick, or Heroick Poem, proposes to sing an
Action; and accordingly entertains the Reader
with it.</P>
<P>And though <HI>Butler</HI> in his Proposition to
<HI>Hudibras,</HI> does not pretend to sing one regu∣lar
Action [for very little of the Rules of
<HI>Aristotle</HI> was known then in <HI>England</HI>] yet
still he proposes to sing Action, or Actions, as
will appear by the Proposition itself.</P>
<Q><PB N="16" REF="23"/>
<L>When Civil Fury first grew high,</L>

<P>So that the excellent Author of <HI>Hudibras,</HI>
who had so admirable a Talent for Pleasantry,
proposes chiefly to entertain his Reader with
the Actions of his Hero.</P>
<P><HI>Now let us take a short View of</HI> P—<HI>'s
Proposition to his</HI> Dunciad; <HI>and after that
you will easily judge</HI> how far 'tis Heroick with
respect to its Nature, and how far it is criti∣cally
such, according to the best Rules of the
Antients, and strictest Ideas of the Moderns.</P>
<Q><L>Books, and the Man, I sing, the first who brings</L>
<L>The <HI>Smithfield</HI> Muses to the Ears of Kings.</L></Q>
<P>Let us divest it of its Jingle, since Rhyme is
of no use to the Nonsense of such Prose as
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
this, but to render it more ridiculous, and
more unintelligible.</P>
<P>I sing Books, and I sing the Man, the first
Man, who carries the Muses of <HI>Smithfield</HI> to
the Ear of Kings.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>P.</HI> sings Books, and not an Action;
and the Author who pretends in an Epick
Poem to sing Books instead of singing an Action,
is only qualified to sing Ballads. And as Na∣ture
has begun to qualify him for that melo∣dious
Vocation, by giving him that Face, that
Shape, and that Stature; so if Fortune would
but finish what Nature has begun, he would
be a Nonpareillo in that Employment. As he
has for several Months last past, been bringing
down a wooden Tempest upon his Carcass, if
one Eye and one Leg should suffer severely by
the Storm, which may very well happen, do
not you think, Sir, that his rare Figure would
proclaim him the Prince of Ballad Singers, as,
by justly deposing you, he has made himself
the King of Dunc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s?</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> is so far from singing an Action, that
there is no such Thing as Action in his whim∣sical
Rhapsody, unless what proceeds from
Dulness, that is, from Privation; a very pretty
Principle of Action, and very worthy of <HI>P</HI>'s
Invention! The Thing is divided into Three
Books. In the First, instead of Action there is
Description and Declamation. In the Third,
instead of Action we have nothing but a
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
feverish Dream. The Second is made up of
Nastiness, Obscenity, and Absurdity; and is
so far from being Part of an Action, that it
runs counter to the Design of the whole Thing,
if there could be any Design in it; for Vigour
of Action can never proceed from Dulness,
though it may from Madness. The Hero of
the Piece does nothing at all, and never speaks
but once, unless it be half a Line in the
Third Book. In the First Book, indeed, he
offers to burn his Works, but is hinder'd by
the Goddess: Now those Works are either
Good or Bad; if they are Good, they render
him incapable of being King of the Dunces; if
they are Bad, the Offer to burn them shews his
Judgment, and Judgment must be always con∣trary
to Dulness, otherwise <HI>P.</HI> would be the
brightest Creature that ever God made.</P>
<P>Whether an Epick Poem, is grave or mock
Epick, the Action must have Probability in all
its Parts: Both antient and modern Criticks
agree in this.</P>
<P><HI>Ficta voluptatis causà sint proxima veris,</HI>
says <HI>Horace, Let every Thing that is invented
to give the Reader Pleasure, be attended with
Probability:</HI> Nay, <HI>Boileau</HI> makes Probability
more necessary than Truth itself, as several of
the Antients and Moderns have likewise done.</P>
<Q><L>Jamais au spectateur n'offrez rien d'incroyable,</L>
<L>Le vrai peut quelque fois n'etre pas vrai sem∣blable.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="26"/>
Une merveille absurde est pour moy sans appas,</L>
<L>L'esprit n'est point emù de ce q'il ne croit pas.</L></Q>
<P>Never offer any thing that is incredible ei∣ther
to the Reader or the Spectator. Truth
sometimes may not have Probability. That
which is absurd, at the same Time that 'tis
wonderful, has no Charms for me. The Soul
is never mov'd with that which it does not
believe.</P>
<P>And the Reason that he gives for this is very
solid, <HI>viz.</HI> Truth may sometimes have the
Appearance of a Lye, but Probability has al∣ways
the Appearance of Truth. And this
mock Probability, <HI>Butler</HI> in his <HI>Hudibras,</HI>
and <HI>Boileau</HI> in his <HI>Lutrin</HI> have preserved in∣violably.
But what Probability is there in <HI>P</HI>'s
Rhapsody? What Probability in the Games
which take up a third Part of the Piece? Is it
not monstrous to imagine any Thing like that
in the Master Street of a populous City; a
Street eternally crowded with Carriages, Carts,
Coaches, Chairs, and Men passing in the
greatest Hurry about Private and Publick
Affairs? What Probability in that noble Inven∣tion
of <HI>Fleet Ditch,</HI> which, besides i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Extra∣vagancy,
and its Stupidity, shews the nasty
Soul of the Author.</P>
<Q><L>Immodest Words admit of no Defence,</L>
<L>For want of Decency, is want of Sense.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="20" REF="27"/>
For all that is said there, must be excessively
shocking to all Men of common Sense, as
shewing want of Respect to the Reader, as
much as to the Authors mentioned there.
Every Man of good Breeding, as well as good
Sense, must be mov'd with Indignation,</P>
<Q><L>At bawling Infamy, with Language base.</L>

<P><HI>P.</HI> talks of <HI>Taylor</HI> the Water-Poet, but
<HI>Taylor</HI> is only call'd so from his Profession.
<HI>P.</HI> is properly the Water-Poet, who has Water-Language,
which he seems to have lived so
many Years at <HI>Chiswick</HI> and <HI>Twickenham,</HI> on
purpose to learn it from his Daily transitory
Masters, the Scullers.</P>
<P>I am sorry I have dwelt so long upon this
whimsical Trifle, call'd, <HI>The Publisher to the
Reader;</HI> which could have been writ by
neither <HI>Christian,</HI> nor <HI>Turk,</HI> nor <HI>Jew,</HI> nor
any one but an Anti-Christian Catholick, edu∣cated
in Jesuitical Maxims, and Religious
Frauds. I appeal to any Man of common
Sense, if this whimsical Fraud could have been
printed so many times in <HI>Duodecimo,</HI> as the
Author pretends it has been, and inserted at
last in the Appendix to the Edition in Quarto,
if it had been writ by any one but <HI>P.</HI> himself.
This appears to me to be utterly impossible:
And the Truth appears so plainly, and strikes
the Reader so strongly through that pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try Ar∣tifice,
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
that if <HI>P.</HI> believes that he conceals him∣self
by it, he shews himself a thousand times
more weak, and exposes himself infinitely more
than by any thing that he can say in Rhyme;
for there are several Persons who believe, that
any Sort of Fiction is allowable in Rhyme; but
all the World expects, that when a Man writes
Prose, he should speak Truth and Reason.</P>
<P>As we have shewn that <HI>P.</HI> knows nothing
of the Art of Poetry in general, we now come
to shew, that he knows as little of <HI>Homer</HI> in
particular, whether we consider the Qualities
and Character of that celebrated <HI>Grecian,</HI> or
the Nature of his Writings; and, in short, as
little of the Characters of other Poets, whether
ancient or modern. And the impartial Rea∣der
will then determine whether the Author
who has all these Defects, is qualified to set up
for a Translator of <HI>Homer,</HI> or for a knowing,
a just, and a judicious Critick.</P>
<P>What <HI>P.</HI> is pleas'd to call his Preface, is
neither a just Dissertation, nor a modest En∣comium,
but an extravagant hyperbolical Pa∣negyrick
on <HI>Homer;</HI> a Heap of dogmatical,
elaborate, illiterate Pedantry: By which he
has equally labour'd to shew the Excellence of
<HI>Homer,</HI> and to expose and detect his own Un∣worthiness.
For there is not in the Translation
he least Shadow of those great Qualities which
either are, or are pretended to be, in <HI>Homer.</HI>
And yet <HI>P.</HI> at the same Time that he is ex∣tolling
him to the Skies, gives infallible Signs
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
that he does not know him, and blindly says
more infamous Things of him, than either
<HI>Terrasson, Le Motte,</HI> or <HI>Perrault.</HI></P>
<P>When the Prefacer tells us, in his very first
Paragraph, that <HI>Hom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> is universally allow'd
to have had the greatest Invention of any
Writer whatever, he is so far from telling us,
at the same Time, what Invention is, that he
plainly di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>covers that he knows nothing of it.
For he seems to take it for a peculiar Faculty
of the Mind, distinct from Memory, Ima∣gination,
and Judgment; whereas it is the Ef∣fect
and Result of the confederate Powers and
Operation of all the three. We have a faint
Image of these Operations in Hawking: For
Memory may be justly compar'd to the Dog
that beats the Field, or the Wood, and that
starts the Game; Imagination to the Falcon
that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Term in <HI>Falconry.</HI></NOTE> clips it upon its Pinions after it; and Judg∣ment
to the Falconer, who directs the Flight,
and who governs the whole. But <HI>P.</HI> as has
been said, takes it for a distinct Faculty; he
opposes it to Judgment in this very Paragraph;
and in the last Paragraph of the third Page,
[<HI>Edit.</HI> 2.] he calls it the strong and the ruling
Faculty.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> tells us, in the first Page of this wonderful
Preface, that whatever Praises may be given to
Works of Judgment, there is not a single
Beauty in them, but is owing to the Invention.
But he ought to have known that this is reci∣procal;
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
and that in Works of Invention there
is not a single Beauty but is owing to the
Judgment; and that is the Reason that none
have had great Beauties, but who have had
great Judgment; as <HI>Homer,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and
some few others of the ancient <HI>Grecian</HI>
and <HI>Roman</HI> Poets, and some very few of the
<HI>English, French,</HI> and <HI>Italian.</HI></P>
<P>In the Beginning of the second Page of
the Preface, [Edition the 2d] <HI>P.</HI> is pleas'd to
tell us, <HI>That the Reason why most Criticks are
inclin'd to prefer a judicious and methodical
Genius to a great and fruitful one, is, because
they find it easier to pursue their Observations
through a uniform and bounded Walk of Art,
than to comprehend the vast and various Ex∣tent
of Nature.</HI> Fine Words without any
Meaning! As if any one could comprehend
the vast and various Extent of Nature, but the
great Author of Nature. If this Prefacer had
not been superlatively ignorant, he would
have known, that the most judicious and me∣thodical
Genius's have been the greatest and
the most fruitful ones; the most admirable,
and the most sublime. The Epick Poems of
<HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> are infallible Proofs of this.</P>
<P>Our Author's Work is a wild Paradise;
[<HI>says</HI> P. <HI>towards the Top of his 2d Page,</HI>]
where, if we cannot see all the Beauties so
distinctly as in an order'd Garden, it is only
because the Number of them is infinitely great∣er.
'Tis like a copious Nursery which contains
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
the Seeds and first Productions of every Kind,
out of which, those who follow'd him have
but selected some particular Plants, each ac∣cording
to his particular Fancy, to cultivate
and beautify. If some Things are too luxu∣riant,
'tis owing to the Richness of the Soil;
and if others are not arriv'd to Perfection or
Maturity, it is only because they are over-run
and oppress'd by those of a stronger Nature.</P>
<P>Now I appeal to you, Sir, if this is not a
Paragraph which shews an Ignorance as gross
and profund as <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Darkness: An Ig∣norance
which may be felt, tho' it cannot be
understood. No <HI>Indian,</HI> no <HI>Negro,</HI> no <HI>Hot∣tentot,</HI>
knows less of <HI>Homer,</HI> than <HI>P.</HI> But
what you and I will be pleas'd with, is this,
that as the Author of this Paragraph has af∣fronted,
abus'd, and slander'd several young
Ladies, which alone is sufficient to shew him
of a Race different from the human; for
even the vilest of Dogs will never abuse a Fe∣male
of his own Species; so Providence has
justly ordain'd that a Lady should revenge the
Quarrel of her Sex, and ridicule, and expose,
and baffle the Author of the said monstrous
Paragraph. I speak of Madam <HI>Dacier.</HI></P>
<P>What! <HI>says she,</HI> is <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem then, ac∣cording
to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> an indigested Heap of
Beauties, without Order or Symmetry; a
Piece of Ground upon which nothing but
Seeds, and nothing perfect or accomplish'd, is
to be found; a Production loaded with many
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
superfluous and unprofitable Things, which
ought to be retrench'd, and which oppress or
disfigure those which ought to be preserv'd?</P>
<P>The most inveterate Enemies to <HI>Homer,
says that judicious Lady,</HI> never said any thing
more injurious, or more unjust, against that
Poet.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P.</HI> will pardon me, <HI>says she,</HI> if I op∣pose
the three Comparisons in this erroneous
Preface, which seem to me to be very false,
and utterly contrary to what the greatest an∣cient
and modern Criticks have thought.</P>
<P>To the Point, then, <HI>she continues;</HI> The
<HI>Iliad</HI> is so far from being a wild Paradise, that
it is the most regular Garden, and laid out
with more Symmetry than ever any Garden
was. Monsieur <HI>Le Notre</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gardener to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. He laid out the Gardens of <HI>Ver∣sailles</HI> and <HI>Marly.</HI></NOTE>, who was the
greatest Man of the World in his Art, never
observ'd in his Garden a more perfect, or more
admirable Symmetry, than <HI>Homer</HI> has observ'd
in his Poems. Every thing that is in them, is
not only in the Place in which it ought justly
to be, but every thing is formed on Purpose
for the Place it possesses. He presents you at
first with that which ought first to be seen; he
places in the Middle what ought to be only
there, and what would be improper either at
the Beginning or End; and he places Things
at a greater Distance, which ought to be so
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
dispos'd, in order to create a greater and a
more agreeable Surprize; and to make use of
a Comparison drawn from Painting, <HI>He dis∣poses
that in the greatest Light, which cannot
be too visible; and sinks and hides in the Ob∣scurity
of the Shadows, what does not require
to be expos'd so fully to Sight. So that we may
say, that</HI> Homer <HI>was the Painter who best
knew how to employ the Lights and the Sha∣dows.
And it was this beauteous and admi∣rable
Order, which</HI> Horace <HI>admir'd in his Po∣ems,
and upon which he founded his Rules for
the perfecting the Art of Poetry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The second Comparison, (she continues) is
as unjust.</HI> How could Mr. <HI>P.</HI> affirm that one
can discover only Seeds, and the immature Pro∣ductions
of every Kind, in the <HI>Iliad?</HI> when
every Beauty in that Poem is so perfect a
Beauty, that the following Ages could find
nothing to add to any Kind of his Excel∣lencies?
And the Ancients have always pro∣pos'd
<HI>Homer</HI> as the most perfect Model, in
every Kind of Poetry.</P>
<P><HI>The third Comparison (she still continues)
is every Jot as unjust, and is compos'd of the
Errors of the two former. Homer</HI> had un∣doubtedly
an incomparable Fertility of Inven∣tion,
but yet a Fertility which is always re∣strain'd
by a just and sincere Judgment,
which made him reject every superfluous
Thing which his boundless Imagination could
offer to him, in order to retain only what was
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
useful or necessary. Judgment guided the
Head of this admirable Gardiner, and was
the Pruning-Hook he made use of in cutting
off every useless Branch from its Trunk. He
has done what <HI>Horace</HI> speaks of in his <HI>Epods,</HI>
<Q>Inutilesque salce ramos amputans
Faeliciores inserit.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P, she continues,</HI> had in an extraor∣dinary
manner oblig'd us, if he had directed
us to the superfluous Branches that ought to
be cut off from this Tree: If he had in∣structed
us in the Symmetry, which ought to
be given to that wild Garden, to render it
more regular; if he had given us an Idea of
that Perfection which he says is wanting to
those several Beauties, of which <HI>Homer,</HI> he
pretends, has only given us a Sketch. It
would be happy for the present Age, and glo∣rious
to <HI>England,</HI> to have produced so perfect
a Critick.</P>
<P>Thus far Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> has defended <HI>Homer;</HI>
she next proceeds to defend herself against the
senseless Cavil which he has brought against
her; which she has done with all the Modesty,
the Justness, and the Address which are pecu∣liar
to that judicious Lady. You have seen
that Defence in the Original. I have nothing
to do but to observe here, that the Wretch
against whom she writes, has been always in∣famous
for his Ingratitude to that Part of the
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
Fair Sex, to whom he has had most Obliga∣tions.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to send you some Re∣marks
of my own upon this Preface.</P>
<P>'Tis in the second Page of it likewise that
this Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acer informs us, <HI>That 'tis to the
Strength of this amazing Invention, that
we are to attribute that unequal'd Fire and
Rapture, which is so forcible in</HI> Homer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
But, by <HI>P</HI>'s Leave, <HI>Homer</HI> owes his Invention
to his Fire, and not his Fire to his Invention:
The more warm any one is by Nature, the
more inventive is that Person, if the Organs
be rightly dispos'd.</P>
<P>But <HI>P.</HI> goes on, <HI>What he,</HI> that is <HI>Homer,
writes,</HI> [that is, every thing that he writes]
<HI>is of the most animated Nature imaginable.</HI>
At the Bottom of this very Page he contra∣dicts
this. For, says he, <HI>'tis remarkable that
his Fancy, which is every where vigorous, is
not discover'd immediately at the Beginning of
his Poem, in its fullest Splendour.</HI> But let us
return to what he says previous to this Con∣tradiction
of himself. <HI>If a Council be call'd,</HI>
says <HI>P, or a Battle fought, you are not coldly
inform'd of what is said or done, as from a
third Person; the Reader is hurried out of
himself, by the Force of the Poet's Imagina∣tion,
and turns in one Place to a Hearer,
in another to a Spectator.</HI> To shew the Ab∣surdity
of this, we shall first consider it with
Regard to Councils, and afterwards with Re∣gard
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
to Battels. If every thing that is said in
Council is of the most animated Nature ima∣ginable,
the Characters of those who speak,
either cannot be maintain'd, or cannot be diver∣sify'd.
And as for Battels, the Reader is as
much a Spectator of those of <HI>Virgil,</HI> as he is
of those of <HI>Homer.</HI> The Muse who presides
over Epick Poetry equally relates both. And
if she relates the Destruction of <HI>Troy</HI> by the
Mouth of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> that was not a Battle
but a Massacre. And the Necessity of the
Action requir'd that Way of relating it; it
being impossible to set otherwise before the
Eyes of <HI>Dido,</HI> a thing that was past and done
in a different Part of the World.</P>
<P>This little Gentleman says, towards the
Top of the third Page of the smaller Edition,
<HI>That exact Disposition, just Thought, correct
Elocution, polish'd Numbers, may have been
found in a thousand; but this poetical Fire,
this</HI> Vivida Vis Animi <HI>in a very few.</HI></P>
<P>If he had studied Twenty Years to be in
the Wrong, he could not have blunder'd
more confoundedly. The very Reverse of
what he asserts is the Truth. Exact Disposi∣tion,
just Thought, correct Elocution, po∣lish'd
Numbers have been found in <HI>Homer</HI>
and <HI>Virgil</HI> alone, of all that have writ in the
Epick Way; but the poetical Fire, the <HI>Vivida
Vis Animi</HI> may have been seen in a Thousand.
But let me see how the little Gentleman goes
on. <HI>Even in Works where all these are im∣perfect
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
or neglected, this even over-powers
Criticism, and makes us admire while we dis∣approve.</HI>
Admirably said, little <HI>Bays,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i'faith,
thou second great Apostle of Nonsense, which
thou art sent by thy evil Genius to preach to
all thy Hundred thousand Admirers! But,
<HI>faveamus Linguis,</HI> let me see how he goes
on, full of the 'foremention'd God, whose
missionary Priest he has the Honour to be.
<HI>Nay, where this</HI> [Fire] <HI>appears, tho' attended
with Absurdities, it brightens all the Rubbish
about it, 'till we see nothing but its own
Splendor.</HI> Now, did <HI>Bays</HI> the first ever say
any thing so full of admirable Judgment as
this? Can we sufficiently admire a Fire that
brightens all the Rubbish about it, 'till the
Rubbish disappears, and is hid by its own
Brightness? But in the Name of Nonsense,
let him go on. <HI>This Fire is discern'd in</HI> Vir∣gil,
<HI>but discern'd as through a Glass, reflected
from</HI> Homer, <HI>more shining than fierce, but every
where equal and constant.</HI> What Devil pos∣sess'd
him, when he wrote such Stuff as this?
The dullest Devil, and the most egregious
Dunce in all the Profund of Hell. What
does he mean by, this Fire is discern'd in
<HI>Virgil,</HI> but discern'd as <HI>through</HI> a Glass, in∣stead
of as <HI>from</HI> a Glass? What does he mean
by reflected from <HI>Homer?</HI> How is the Fire
in the Fourth, the Sixth, the Tenth <HI>Eclogue</HI>
reflected from <HI>Homer?</HI> or the Fire of
those noble Passages in the <HI>Georgicks;</HI> the
Death of <HI>Caesar;</HI> the Praise of <HI>Italy,</HI> or a
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
Country Life; or the Plague among the dumb
Creation; or the Story of <HI>Orpheus?</HI> How
comes this trifling Poetaster, without the least
Sagacity or Penetration, to make those Di∣stinctions
and those Discoveries, which the
greatest and the most judicious Criticks could
never make? How much Reason have we
here to cry out with my Lord <HI>Roscommon;</HI>
<Q><L>How many Ages since has <HI>Virgil</HI> writ?</L>
<L>How few are they who understand him yet?</L>
<L>Approach his Altars with Religious Fear;</L>
<L>No vulgar Deity inhabits there.</L>
<L>Heav'n shakes not more at <HI>Jove</HI>'s imperial Nod</L>
<L>Than Poets should before their <HI>Mantuan</HI> God.</L>
<L>Hail, mighty <HI>Maro!</HI> may that sacred Name</L>
<L>Kindle my Breast with thy Coelestial Flame.</L></Q></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Roscommon</HI> speaks not of <HI>Virgil</HI>
as of a Poet whose Fire was discern'd as thro'
a Glass, because my Lord <HI>Roscommon,</HI> felt
the Fire of that admirable Poet. What does
this <HI>Twickenham</HI> Poetaster mean, when he
speaks of the Fire of <HI>Virgil,</HI> as more shining
than fierce, and as of a Fire every where equal
and constant? The Fire of a great and judi∣cious
Poet is caus'd by his Ideas, and therefore
can never be equal and constant, because the
Ideas cannot possibl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be always equal. What?
Is the Fire of <HI>Virgil</HI> every where equal to that
Divine Passage of the <HI>Cumaean</HI> Sybil, in the
Sixth <HI>Aeneid?</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="32" REF="39"/>
<L>Ventum erat ad limen, cum virgo, Poscere fata</L>
<L>Tempus, ait: Deus, ecce, Deus. Cui talia fanti</L>

<L>Et rabie fera corda tument; majorque videri,</L>

<P>Which my Lord <HI>Roscommon</HI> has thus finely
imitated, in his admirable Essay on Translated
Verse:
<Q><L>Have you been led thro' the <HI>Cumaean</HI> Cave,</L>
<L>And heard th' impatient Maid divinely rave?</L>
<L>I hear her now; I see her rowling Eyes;</L>
<L>And panting; Lo! the God, the God, she
cries;</L>
<L>With Words not hers, and more than human
Sound,</L>
<L>She makes th' obedient Ghosts peep trembling
thro' the Ground.</L></Q></P>
<P>But now let us come to <HI>Milton,</HI> in whom,
if we will believe this little Gentleman, <HI>the
poetical Fire glows like a Furnace, kept up to
an uncommon Fierceness by the Force of Art.</HI>
Now, I dare engage that there are not Two
Persons in the World who understand what
the little Gentleman says there, and I do really
believe that there is not one. What? is the
Transcendency of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Genius, which has
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
been admir'd by all the capable World, re∣duced
to Art? Pray, how is the Fire of <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
and <HI>Virgil</HI> kept up? for they seem to me
to have vastly more of the poetical Art than
<HI>Milton.</HI> Indeed <HI>Milton</HI> had more Felicity than
they, which threw him upon the Subject of
<HI>Paradise Lost;</HI> a Subject which often fur∣nish'd
him with the greatest Ideas, which sup∣ply'd
him with the greatest Spirit. But to shew
that it was rather Felicity than Art or Skill,
that determin'd him to that Choice, he was
by no means so happy in the Choice of <HI>Pa∣radise
Regain'd,</HI> a Subject that could supply
him neither with the Ideas nor with the Spi∣rit.
For Pride and Ambition, Rage and Re∣venge,
and Fury, furnish'd quite another sort
of Spirit, than Patience, Resignation, Humi∣lity,
Meekness, Long-suffering, and the rest
of those quiet divine Virtues that adorn the
Christian Scheme. Besides, <HI>Milton</HI>'s Fire is
so very far from being kept always up by Art,
that for near a sixth Part of the Poem it's set
down for want of Art. For this Poem is
so order'd, that the Subject of the Eleventh
and Twelfth Books could by no means supply
him with the great Ideas, nor consequently
with the great Spirit, which the First, Second,
and Sixth had done before; and several Parts
of the other Books likewise.</P>
<P>It would require a Volume to expose all
the numerous Errors and Blunders which are
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be met with in his Preface. At the Bot∣tom
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
of his Third Page he tells us, <HI>That</HI> Homer
<HI>open'd a new and boundless Walk for his Ima∣gination,
and created a World for himself in
the Invention of Fable: That which</HI> Aristotle
<HI>calls the Soul of Poetry, was first breath'd
in it by</HI> Homer. And here that Learned and
Judicious Lady finds Two Faults in that Asser∣tion.
First, she condems the Fustian in it, be∣cause
it raises no clear and distinct Idea in her
Mind; and secondly, she censures the False∣hood
in it. <HI>There is not,</HI> says she, <HI>the least
Shadow of Truth in asserting, that</HI> Homer
<HI>invented the Fable. It was invented long
before his Time; and he found the Use of it
wholly establish'd, as I have shewn in my
Preface to the</HI> Odysses.</P>
<P>I shall now leave Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> for a Mo∣ment,
in order to return to her again imme∣diately.</P>
<P>The fourth and the fifth Pages of the 'fore∣mention'd
Edition, are taken up with a most im∣pertinent
Division of Fable, into the Probable,
the Allegorical, and the Marvellous, which Divi∣sion
I suppose he had from some Popish Pe∣dant,
and perhaps, from the sacred Scaramou∣chi
his Preceptor. Now, in the first Place, he
makes the Allegorical a distinct Species of Fa∣ble,
whereas there cannot possibly be any
Fable, that is, any Action founded upon a
Moral, but what is allegorical. In the second
Place, in the Epick Fable [which is of the
same Nature with the <HI>Aesopian</HI> Fables, and
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
is distinguish'd only by its Length] that is,
in the Epick Action founded upon its Moral,
these Three Qualities, of Allegorical, Proba∣ble,
Admirable are united. What Reason
then can this Author have to make these
Three so many distinct Species of Fable, in∣stead
of making them Three distinguish'd Qua∣lities
of the Epick Fable, of which alone
'tis his Business to treat here? The Fable of
an Epick Poem, is very justly defin'd, a Dis∣course
invented by Art, to form the Manners
by the Allegory of an Action, related in an
agreeable, a profitable, and a wonderful
Manner.</P>
<P><HI>In treating of the marvellous Fable [for a
Pedant naturally affects obsolete Words,] he
speaks of the Machines of</HI> Homer, <HI>concerning
which he is pleas'd to tell us,</HI> That whatever
Cause there might be to blame them in a phi∣losophical
or a religious View, they are so per∣fect
in the poetical, that Mankind have been
ever since contented to follow them; none have
been able to enlarge the Sphere of Poetry be∣yond
the Limits which he has set. Every
Attempt of this Nature has prov'd unsuccess∣ful;
and after all the various Changes of
Times and Religions, his Gods continue to this
Day, the Gods of Poetry.</P>
<P>What a monstrous Mixture of Ignorance
and Impudence is here? In the Compass of
Eight Lines there are no less than Four gross
Errors. The first is this, <HI>That Mankind have
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
been contented to follow,</HI> or [to speak <HI>English</HI>]
<HI>to make use of</HI> Homer'<HI>s Machines ever since</HI>
Homer'<HI>s Time;</HI> whereas all the World knows,
that <HI>Tasso, Milton, Cowley,</HI> and several more
have made use of very different ones. The
second Error is this: <HI>None have been able to
enlarge the Sphere of Poetry beyond the Li∣mits
which he has set.</HI> I neither understand
this, nor can I meet with any one who does
understand it: What does <HI>P.</HI> mean by that
Cant and that Fustian, <HI>enlarging the Sphere of
Poetry,</HI> and <HI>setting Limits to the Sphere of
Poetry?</HI> Now, downright Nonsense is cer∣tainly
the greatest of all Errors and Blunders.
In other Errors <HI>Pegasus</HI> only trips or stumbles,
but in Nonsense, the Beast falls flat down, and
flounders in the Mud.</P>
<P>Now follows the Third Error. <HI>Every At∣tempt,</HI>
says <HI>P, of this Nature has prov'd
unsuccessful.</HI> That is, every Attempt to make
use of other Machines than what <HI>Homer</HI> has
made use of. Now, but two of the ancient
Poets, who have writ in the Epick Way, have
succeeded with the heathen Machines, and
those are <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and as many of
the Moderns have succeeded without those
Machines, and those are <HI>Tasso</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI>
whose Machines are almost entirely taken from
the Christian Scheme. And their Success is
a Proof from Fact of the Fourth Error, and
is an incontestable one, that the Gods of <HI>Ho∣mer</HI>
do not continue to this Day to be the
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
Gods of Poetry. 'Tis impossible that any one
at this Time could write an Epick Poem with
heathen Machines successfully. There would
be great Folly in attempting it, because the
Use of such Machines would be destructive not
only of Truth, but of all Probability. As
for <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> when they writ, they
had Probability on their Side. And it would
be high Injustice to condemn them for not
foreseeing what 'tis impossible they could fore∣see,
the universal Change of Religion.</P>
<P>There is another egregious Blunder of <HI>P</HI>'s,
in the Eighth Page of the smaller Edition,
which Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> has with just Severity
censur'd. <HI>Every thing in the</HI> Iliad, says <HI>P,
has Manners, as</HI> Aristotle, says he, <HI>expresses
it; that is, every thing is acted or spoken.
Nothing,</HI> says Madam <HI>Dacier, can be more
contrary to the Doctrine of that Philosopher.</HI>
He never said that any thing has Manners,
<HI>because it is either acted or spoken.</HI> On the
contrary he tells us, <HI>that there are Discourses
without Manners, and that, in his Time,
there were several Dramatick Pieces without
Manners, and that yet there were in those
Pieces both Action and Discourse; a certain
Sign,</HI> says he, <HI>that Manners are neither Acti∣on
nor Discourse, since Action and Discourse
may be without Manners. What then are
Manners,</HI> says she, <HI>according to that Philoso∣pher?</HI>
Manners then, says <HI>Aristotle,</HI> are the
Things that discover the Inclination of him
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
who speaks, and the Choice that he is bent
and determin'd to make on Occasions in
which it would not be easy to see what he
will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollow, and what he will avoid.</P>
<P>I come now to the second Preliminary, that
I propos'd to take Notice of, which is call'd,
<HI>A Letter to the Publisher,</HI> and sign'd <HI>W. C.</HI>
but was undoubtedly writ by <HI>P.</HI> himself. For
it is so full of Folly, Falshood, and Impu∣dence,
and the Flattery to <HI>P.</HI> is so fulsome
and so nauscous, that there is not a Man in
<HI>England</HI> who is Fool enough to offer that
Incense to <HI>P.</HI> but himself. And that he
himself is very capable of it, we shall give
an undeniable Proof anon.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Will. Cleland,</HI> I know not whether
there is such a worthy Person in the World
or not. But if there is, he will be certainly
oblig'd to me for taking the Fool's Cap from
his own Head, and clapping it upon the Pate
of <HI>P,</HI> who is most worthy of it. I have nei∣ther
Time nor Inclination to go thro' all the
Paragraphs; but I shall repeat Two or Three
of them, which will be sufficient to shew the
vile and filthy Falshood of the rest.</P>
<P>The first of them is in the Middle of the
Sixth Page, of the Edition in <HI>Quarto,</HI> and
begins with these Words: <HI>I perceiv'd that
most of these Authors had been</HI> [doubtless very
wisely] <HI>the first Aggressors:</HI> Both you and I,
Sir, have the Honour to know several of
them, of whom we know this to be false.
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
But give me leave to acquaint you with what
has pass'd between that little envious mischie∣vous
Creature and myself. At his first com∣ing
to Town, he was very importunate with the
late Mr. <HI>Henry Cromwell</HI> to introduce him to
me: The Recommendation of Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI>
engaged me to be about thrice in Company
with him; after which I went into the Coun∣try,
and neither saw him nor thought of him,
'till I found myself most insolently attack'd by
him, in his very superficial Essay upon Criti∣cism,
which was the Effect of his impotent
Envy and Malice, by which he endeavour'd to
destroy the Reputation of a Man who had
publish'd Pieces of Criticism, and to set up
his own. I was mov'd with Indignation to
that Degree, at so much Baseness, that I im∣mediately
writ Remarks upon that Essay, in
order to expose the Weakness and the Absur∣dity
of it; which Remarks were publish'd, as
soon as they could be printed. I afterwards
writ and publish'd Remarks upon Part of his
Translation of <HI>Homer,</HI> upon his <HI>Windsor Fo∣rest,</HI>
and his infamous <HI>Temple of Fame.</HI> When
I had done this, I thought I had Reason to
be satisfied with the Revenge I had taken.
As these several Remarks had made great Im∣pressions
upon the Minds of Persons of un∣doubted
Sense, and so esteem'd by the Pub∣lick,
<HI>P.</HI> began to repent of the Affront he
had offer'd me, and the Injury he had at∣tempted
to do me: And to give some Proofs
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
of his Repentance, he subscrib'd to the
Two Volumes of Select Works, almost in
spite of my Friend Mr. <HI>Henry Cromwell,</HI> in
whose Hands he found the Proposals. He
likewise subscrib'd afterwards to the Two Vo∣lumes
of Letters, which engag'd me to strike
out several very just and severe Reflections
against him, which were scatter'd up and down
in those Letters. In Acknowledgment of
which, he sent me the following Letter, to∣gether
with the second Payment:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. JOHN DENNIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Call'd to receive the Two Books of your
Letters from Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> and have left
with him the little Money I am in your Debt.
I look upon myself to be much more so, for
the Omissions you have been pleas'd to make
in those Letters in my Favour, and sincerely
join with you in the Desire, that not the least
Traces may remain of that Difference between
us which indeed I am sorry for. You may
therefore believe me, without either Ceremony
or Falseness,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>

Humble Servant,

1721.</DATE>
<SIGNED>A. POPE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="41" REF="48"/>
And now, Sir, perhaps you may be of
Opinion that I had Reason to be satisfied,
and to regard Mr. <HI>P.</HI> as a Friend. I indeed
from that Hour ceas'd to be his Enemy, but
could not put an entire Confidence in him,
as often as I reflected on a Piece of monstrous
Perfidy, which he had been guilty of seven
Years before; of which I shall give you as
short an Account as I can. The great Suc∣cess
of Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s <HI>Cato</HI> fermented his Envy,
and provok'd his Malice exceedingly. To dis∣charge
some Part of his Spleen, he goes to
Mr. <HI>Lintot</HI> the Bookseller, and persuades him
to engage me to write some Remarks upon
Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Play. He prevail'd upon the
Bookseller, and the Bookseller upon me. I
need not acquaint you that I wrote and pub∣lish'd
such Remarks. But his Gratitude for my
complying with his Request, may, perhaps,
be a Piece of News, that will not a little sur∣prize
you: He writes a very scurrilous and im∣pertinent
Pamphlet, in which he acquaints his
Reader, that I was in the Hands of Dr. <HI>Norris,</HI> a
Curer of mad People, at his House in <HI>Hat∣ton-Garden,</HI>
tho' at the same Time I appear'd
publickly every Day both in the Park and in
the Town. The Manuscript of this Pamphlet
he offer'd to shew to Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> before it
was printed, who had too much Honour, and
too much good Sense to approve of so
black a Proceeding. He was so far from
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
approving of it, that he immediately engag'd
Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> to write the following
Letter to <HI>Lintot.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Mr. <HI>Lintot,</HI> <DATE>August 4, 1713.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>MR. <HI>Addison</HI> desir'd me to tell you, that
he wholly disapproves the Manner of
Treating Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> in a little Pamphlet, by
way of Dr. <HI>Norris</HI>'s Account. When he thinks
fit to take Notice of Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s Objecti∣ons
to his Writings, he will do it in a Way
Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> shall have no just Reason to com∣plain
of. But when the Papers above-men∣tioned,
were offer'd to be communicated to
him, he said he could not, either in Honour
or Conscience, be privy to such a Treatment,
and was sorry to hear of it. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
Your very Humble Servant,
<SIGNED>RICHARD STEELE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter was sent by Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI>
to Mr. <HI>Lintot,</HI> and by the latter transmitted
to me. As soon as I had perus'd it, I thought
it concern'd me to preserve the Original with
the utmost Care, which I shall not fail to
communicate to you, the very first Time I
wait on you.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="50"/>
Thus, Sir, have I given you the Reasons
why upon the receiving Mr. <HI>P</HI>'s Letter, I
could not resolve to be his Friend, nor to hold
any Correspondence with one of his perfidious
Nature, tho' from that Time I ceas'd to be his
Enemy, till he gave me a fresh Provocation,
by publishing his chimerical <HI>Profund</HI> and his
filthy <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and so became a second Time
the Aggressor; and as he has been twice so to
me, he has been so to several others, in Spight
of the Assertion of <HI>sagacious Will. Cleland,</HI>
alias <HI>Matt. Scribbler,</HI> alias <HI>Alexander P.</HI> For
all Persons of Honour and Integrity like his,
love exceedingly to go by an <HI>alias.</HI></P>
<P>Having said so much of the Falseness of his
Assertions with Regard to my self, I beg Leave
to mention some more of them, before I
come to the two Paragraphs, that in the 13th
and that in the 14th Page of <HI>The Letter to the
Publisher.</HI> He is pleas'd to say somewhere in his
<HI>4to</HI> Edition, that the Character which Mr. <HI>Jacob</HI>
gives of me in his <HI>Lives of the</HI> English <HI>Poets,</HI>
is my own: In Contradiction to which, I
here send you a Letter which I lately receiv'd
from that Gentleman, by the Perusal of which,
you will be pleas'd to see, how apt flagitious
and abandon'd Men are to throw their own
Crimes in the Faces of innocent Persons. Be∣fore
you begin it, I solemnly declare, before
God, that I neither solicited it, or expected it,
before he acquainted me that he had writ it.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
<HEAD>To Mr. DENNIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>Thursday April 24, 1729.</DATE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Mr. <HI>Alexander Pope</HI>'s new Edition of
his <HI>Dunciad, with Notes and Additions,</HI>
I find he has done me the Honour to make
me your great Friend and Second, in many
Places of that extraordinary Piece; an Honour
I could not expect: But as he has therein
charg'd me with Facts of which I am innocent,
on account of my <HI>Lives of the Poets,</HI> and
violently attack'd the Reputations of several
ingenious Gentlemen, endeavouring to render
me the Author of his Scandal, I am to clear
up these Matters, which are of some Impor∣tance,
by a just Vindication of my self and
others, and a thorough Detection of this great
Slanderer.</P>
<P>I shall begin with an Enquiry into <HI>Pope</HI>'s
Calumny against you. He, in his <HI>Dunciad,</HI>
Book the 2d, would persuade the Publick that
your self had a Hand in the small Encomium
on your Character inserted in the 1st Volume
of my <HI>Lives of the</HI> English <HI>Poets,</HI> where I
say in general, <HI>That you are a Person of sound
Learning, Master of a great deal of Pene∣tration
and Judgment, and perfectly regular
in all your Performances;</HI> with a few parti∣cular
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
Observations, on the <HI>Justness</HI> of the
Design, <HI>Conduct,</HI> and Moral of your <HI>Plays:</HI>
The least, give me Leave to tell you, that
could be said in your Behalf, by any impar∣tial
Writer, who had any Knowledge of you,
or your Works: But this scanty Praise of you,
is thought a great deal too much, by the selfish
Mr. <HI>Pope;</HI> wherefore he at length insinuates,
that you are the Author of it, which is a ma∣licious
and scandalous Insinuation, without the
least Foundation of Truth; for I do solemnly
declare [without any previous Sollicitation
whatsoever] that you knew nothing at all
thereof, till the Book was printed, and pub∣lish'd
by the Bookseller.</P>
<P>Now to demonstrate how far the invidious
Charge, which he endeavours to fix upon you,
and other Poets, belongs to himself only, I
shall here relate the true secret History con∣cerning
himself. In <HI>The Lives of the Poets,</HI>
Vol. II. p. 145, 146, 151, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Sentences
following are by his Authority: <HI>This excellent
Poet,</HI> [Alexander Pope] <HI>whose Fame exceeds
not his Merit,</HI> was born, <HI>&amp;c. There is great
Ease, Strength, Wit, and Judgment, in his
Compositions; all his Pieces are universally
applauded, and the great</HI> Sheffield <HI>asserted his
Work. His private Character is the best,</HI> be∣ing
summ'd up in a good Companion, <HI>and a
firm Friend. Mr.</HI> Pope <HI>has Fire and Spirit
equal to that great Undertaking, his Tran∣slation
of</HI> Homer: <HI>And he is excellent in Prose
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
as well as Verse,</HI> &amp;c. That these high Praises
and Commendations of himself were by him
particularly approv'd of, in a printed Proof of
his Life and Character, which I transmitted to
him for his Correction, I am ready to make
Oath of, if requir'd; and by his Alterations
and Additions therein, he entirely made the
Compliment his own; which now I under∣stand
he, in his abundant Modesty, judges too
little, tho' his great Superiors, in any Ac∣counts
of them, would have been very well
contented with less.</P>
<P>I did every Thing in my Power, by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI>
who was generally thought to be a rising Ge∣nius,
to honour and oblige him; much more
than by Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> whose
Favour and Friendship I happily procur'd, and
which continued till their Deaths. But <HI>Pope</HI>
is not a <HI>Prior,</HI> nor a <HI>Congreve,</HI> and I may
venture to say, never will be: For as he is evi∣dently
deficient of their poetical Talents and
Abilities, so he is a perfect Stranger to their
Gratitude, Honour, and great Humanity, the
most shining Parts of these excellent Mens
Characters.</P>
<P>The Reward of my good Offices by <HI>Pope,</HI>
has been the greatest Abuse he could invent.
It seems the envious little Gentleman is angry
with me for presuming to say any thing in
Favour of others. Here's the Center and
Fountain of his Malice. Truly he can bear
no Character in Competition with his own,
especially since the above-mention'd Poets have
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
been dead, in whose Life-times he dared not
to publish his Impudence and Nonsense: Tho'
now he fancies himself <HI>Lord over all,</HI> and, like
<HI>King Bambridge,</HI> late Warden of the <HI>Fleet</HI> Pri∣son,
he endeavour'd to exercise the most ty∣rannick
Government within his imaginary Ju∣risdiction.
He has done all in the Compass
of his Malice, to defame, injure, and beat
down every one he knew, except his Friend
and Confederate the ingenious <HI>John Gay,</HI> on
Pretence of my accusing of whom, for tel∣ling
the Truth of that extraordinary Gentle∣man,
I have the great and disproportion'd
Share of his violent Invectives which run thro'
his <HI>Dunciad.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Shakespear</HI> lately printed, and
some of his Translations, one might imagine
he intended to claim the sole Prerogative of
Blundering to himself. His Blunders in most
of his Performances, are very manifest! And
therefore he calls others Blunderers, and Fools,
in so polite a Manner, as not to be parallell'd
or imitated. The Lines upon me in his stupid
Poem, are very harmless, tho' very maliciously
aim'd; for as to my being a Blunderbuss of
Law, this cannot go for any thing, even with
the weakest of his Readers and Admirers; be∣cause
they, with others, will, I think, be
oblig'd to own, that the great Poet <HI>Alexander
Pope,</HI> is no Judge of Law, nor can he make
it appear that what he hath said of me, was
ever esteem'd any Part of my Character. So
that on this just Reasoning I am clear of his
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
Satire, (which ought to subsist on some Grounds
of Truth) altho' not of his Abuse.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to say how long Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>
was writing of his <HI>Dunciad;</HI> but his great
Malice against me, has been ten Years hatch∣ing
and laying up, so as not to be brought to
Light till the <HI>Beggars Opera,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> and
Company was acted in the Theatre; which
low and licentious dramatical Piece, design'd
for the Encouragement of Gentlemen on the
Highway, and their female Associates, in <HI>Dru∣ry-Lane,</HI>
by its extraordinary Novelty, hap∣pening
to strike the giddy Humour of the
Town, has introduc'd a new Species of the
vilest Farce, and turn'd the Heads of both
<HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Gay</HI> (who clubb'd their Wit in that
Performance) since which, their Pride is be∣come
intolerable to all Men of common Sense.
But these great poetical Champions in the
Cause of <HI>Newgate,</HI> will be justly pourtraited
in a Supplement to my Account of them in
<HI>The Lives of the Poets.</HI></P>
<P>When I writ and publish'd my <HI>Historical
Register in my Lives of the</HI> English <HI>Poets,</HI>
which is so long ago as 1719, I endeavour'd
to act the candid Part by every Author I
could get easy Intelligence of; and whatever
mean Opinion Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> may have at any
Time have conceiv'd of me, he had once some
Regard for my poor Judgment, otherwise he
would not have enter'd into any Corre∣spondence
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
with me by Letter, or subscrib'd
two Guinea's for one small Book in <HI>Oc∣tavo,</HI>
to</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
Your Humble Servant,
<SIGNED>GILES JACOB.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I need not observe to you, Sir, that there
are three Things remarkable in this Letter.
The first, which I hinted at in the Introduction
to it, is, that there are Persons in the World
who are impudent and unjust to that Degree,
as to throw their own Crimes in the Faces of
innocent Persons. The second, which I like∣wise
hinted at above, is that Mr. <HI>P.</HI> is prov'd
by Facts attested by a Person of great Since∣rity,
to be his own Trumpeter. The third is,
that Mr. <HI>P.</HI> has a very great Soul, a Soul ex∣alted
as much above Gratitude, as above Jus∣tice
or Modesty. The Gentleman who wrote
this Letter, in Complaisance to Mr. <HI>P,</HI> gives
him a Character which they both very well
knew that he was far from deserving. Mr <HI>P,</HI>
by Way of Acknowledgment for this Favour,
acquaints the World, the very first Opportu∣nity,
that Mr. <HI>Jacob</HI> is a Blunderbuss of Law,
of which <HI>P</HI> does not understand one Syllable,
as appears both by his Actions, and by his
Writings; which are all of them as contrary
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
to Law, as they are to Reason and Equity. If
<HI>P.</HI> had call'd him a Blunderer in Criticism,
Men of Sense would have been apt to have
believ'd him, before they had perus'd Mr. <HI>Ja∣cob</HI>'s
Letter.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>P.</HI> has been pleas'd in several Places
of his wonderful <HI>Rhapsody,</HI> to declare that I
wrote such and such Things in Concert
with the late Mr. <HI>Gildon,</HI> I here solemnly
declare, upon the Word and Honour of a
Gentleman, that I never wrote so much as
one Line, that was afterwards printed, in
Concert with any one Man whatsoever. I here
send you the Copies of two Letters, which I
receiv'd formerly from Mr. <HI>Gildon,</HI> by which
it will plainly appear to one of your Discern∣ment,
that we are not Writers in Concert with
each other.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Mr. GILDON to Mr. DENNIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE> <DATE>Aug. 11, 1721.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I This Minute receiv'd your Letter, which
has given me an infinite Satisfaction: For
the Height of my Ambition was to please Men
of the best Judgment. And finding that I have
entertain'd my Master agreeably, I have the
Extent of the Reward of my Labour. I am
sorry I have not pleas'd you in what I have said
of Mr. <HI>Wycherley;</HI> because I am sensible that
by not pleasing you, I am so far in the wrong,
and am so far prepossess'd against my self, that
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
before-hand I plead guilty to your Charge. I
should be extreamly glad to hear you in my
little Room; which will very much oblige,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
Your most Humble Servant.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The second Letter is as follows:
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. DENNIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <DATE>Jan. 10, 1721-22.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>MY Amanuensis, Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> having been
very ill, I had not the Opportunity of
hearing your excellent Pamphlet till this Day.
I am infinitely satisfy'd and pleas'd with it, and
hope that you will meet with that Encourage∣ment
and Reward, which your admirable Per∣formance
most evidently deserves. What I have
more to say to you upon that Head, I shall
keep till I have the Happiness of your Con∣versation;
who am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
Your Oblig'd Humble Servant,
<SIGNED>CHARLES GILDON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="59"/>
Now, Sir, is it not plain that any one who
sends such Compliments to another, has not
been us'd to write in Partnership with him to
whom he sends them?</P>
<P>I come now to the two Paragraphs in the
13th and the 14th Pages of <HI>Will. Cleland</HI>'s Letter
to the Publisher, which, as we observ'd above,
was certainly writ by <HI>P.</HI> himself; who, like
a very modest Gentleman, not only compares
himself to <HI>Boileau,</HI> but likewise prefers him∣self
to that great and artful Poet. He might
as well have comp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd himself, and preferr'd
himself, to <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> because he
is call'd <HI>Sawny.</HI> But there are the following
<HI>trifling</HI> Differences between that great <HI>French∣man,</HI>
and our little <HI>English</HI> Bard.</P>
<P>I. <HI>Boileau</HI> has as much or more of the Prin∣ciples
of good Writing in Poetry, than any
<HI>French</HI> Poet whatever. The Principles of
good Writing according to <HI>Horace,</HI> are
good Sense, Judgment, and Moral Philosophy.</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> has less of these good Qualities than
any <HI>English</HI> Poet whatever; there being no
such Thing as Judgment or good Sense to be
found in his trifling Productions.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Boileau</HI> has a great deal of Art, as well
as Genius; <HI>P.</HI> has neither Art nor Genius.
Art is always the Effect of Judgment; and
there never was a great Genius for Poetry,
without great Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="60"/>
III. The Censures of <HI>Boileau</HI> are always
just, and therefore his are just and legitimate
Satires. The Censures of <HI>P.</HI> are unjust to
the very Height of Impudence, and there∣fore
<HI>P</HI>'s Invectives are malicious and infa∣mous
Libels.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Boileau</HI> praises as many of the
<HI>French</HI> Poets as he satirizes, and not only
those who died before he wrote, as <HI>Marot,
St. Gelais, Malherbe, Racan, Reigner,</HI> but
likewise his Contemporaries, as <HI>Corneille, Ra∣cine,
Moliere, La Fontaine, Segrais, Bease∣rade,</HI>
and likewise the principal Writers of
Prose that liv'd in his Time, as the great Mon∣sieur
<HI>Pascall, Ablancourt, Patru,</HI> and <HI>La
Bruyere.</HI> But <HI>Pope</HI> never commended any
of his Contemporaries, unless two or three
contemptible Wretches in his own Cabal,
but like an <HI>Indian</HI> that runs a Muck, endea∣vours
to assassinate both Friend and Foe, 'till
he meets with the <HI>Indian</HI>'s Fate.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Boileau</HI> speaks always of himself, with
Humility, Modesty, and Discretion. <HI>Pope</HI>
speaks of himself with the utmost Pride and
Folly, and arrogant Impudence.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>Boileau</HI> has generously commended an
Author that was very poor, as <HI>Patru,</HI> who
was a fine, though unfortunate Genius. Nay,
he not only generously commended that Au∣thor,
so far celebrated for the Delicacy of his
Writings, but acted by him more generously
than he spoke. And when he was reduced
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
by the Cruelty of his Creditors, to part with
his choice Library, which he had been so long
in collecting; <HI>Boileau</HI> most honourably laid
down the Price of it, and gave <HI>Patru</HI> the En∣joyment
of it, for the rest of his Life. But
neither the Action nor the Commendation is
in <HI>Pope</HI>'s little and sordid Soul, or his envi∣ous,
malicious, and insolent Nature.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>Boileau</HI> has Numbers, <HI>Pope</HI> has none.
The <HI>Pegasus</HI> of <HI>Boileau</HI> has all its Paces: The
<HI>Pegasus</HI> of <HI>Pope,</HI> like a <HI>Kentish</HI> Post-Horse,
is always upon the <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as has been
observ'd formerly.</P>
<P>VIII. <HI>Boileau</HI> allows those whom he sati∣rizes
to have their Merit, and their good Qua∣lities,
and had more of the Gentleman as well
as the fine Writer in him, than to call them
either Dunces, or Blockheads, or Fools. Such
Language becomes none but the Boors and
Clowns of <HI>Parnassus;</HI> and therefore neither
<HI>Quinaut,</HI> nor <HI>St. Amant,</HI> nor <HI>Brebeuf,</HI> nor
<HI>Scudery,</HI> nor <HI>Chapelain</HI> had any such from him,
nor any other Writer whom he has attack'd
in his Satires.</P>
<P>The following Passage in one of his Prefa∣ces
is a convincing Proof of this.</P>
<P>“I shall content myself with putting the
Reader in Mind of one thing, which 'tis
convenient he should know; which is, that,
by attacking in my Satires, the Defects of ma∣ny
of the Writers of the Age in which
we live, I never pretended by doing that, to
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
deprive these Writers of the Merit and the
good Qualities which they may otherwise
have. I never pretended, I say, that <HI>Chape∣lain,</HI>
tho' a wretched Poet enough, did not
formerly write, I know not by what means,
an Ode that was not contemptible, and that
there was neither Wit nor Agreeableness
in the Works of Monsieur <HI>Quinaut,</HI> tho'
very far remov'd from the Perfection of <HI>Vir∣gil.</HI>
I am oblig'd to add concerning the
latter, that at the Time in which I wrote
against him we were both very young, and
that he afterwards publish'd several Works,
which got him just Reputation. I am like∣wise
ready to own, that there is Genius in
the Writings of <HI>St. Amant,</HI> of <HI>Brebeuf,</HI> of
<HI>Scudery,</HI> and of several others, whom I have
criticiz'd, and who, as well as myself, richly
deserve to be criticiz'd. In a Word, with
the same Sincerity with which I have rallied
them for their Defects, I am willing to
allow whatever they may have that is excel∣lent.
And thus, I hope, I have done them
Justice, and have convinc'd the Reader, that
it was not a Spirit of Envy or Calumny that
caus'd me to write against them.”</P>
<P>IX. <HI>Boileau</HI> has not made scandalons Re∣flections
upon the Lives of innocent Persons,
as <HI>P.</HI> has done, which the ingenious and saga∣cious
Author of <HI>Pope Alexander's Supremacy</HI>
has very justly observ'd.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="63"/>
X. <HI>Boileau</HI> was plac'd, by his great Qua∣lities,
highly above those whom he satiriz'd,
whereas <HI>P.</HI> is many Degrees below several of
those whom he has libell'd; below <HI>Philips</HI>
as a Writer of Pastorals; below You as a Cri∣tick,
an Editor, a modern Dramatick Poet,
or a Translator of ancient Poetry. For if
your Translation of <HI>Aeschylus</HI> is equal to
the <HI>Specimen</HI> which I have seen of it, of
which I make no doubt; it may make him
blush for his Translation of <HI>Homer.</HI> And if
neither of you have had a Subscription ad∣equate
to your Merits, 'tis because in this wise
and judicious Age, the Age of <HI>Opera's,</HI> of
<HI>Beggars Opera's,</HI> of <HI>Dunciads,</HI> and <HI>Hurlo∣thrumbo's,</HI>
'tis not in the Nature of Things
at present, and consequently an Impossibility,
that any Author can have a generous Sub∣scription
to a Work that highly deserves it.</P>
