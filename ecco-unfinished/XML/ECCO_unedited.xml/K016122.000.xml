<L>THE tragic Muse has long forgot to please</L>
<L>With <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Nature, or with <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Ease:</L>
<L>No Passion mov'd, thro' five long Acts you sit,</L>
<L>Charm'd with the Poet's Language, or his Wit.</L>
<L>Fine Things are said, no matter whence they fall;</L>
<L>Each single Character might speak them all.</L>
<L>But from this modern fashionable Way,</L>
<L>To Night, our Author begs your Leave to stray.</L>
<L>No fustian Hero rages here to Night;</L>
<L>No Armies fall, to fix a Tyrant's Right:</L>
<L>From lower Life we draw our Scene's Distress:</L>
<L>— Let not your Equals move your Pity less!</L>
<L>Virtue distrest in humble State support;</L>
<L>Nor think, she never lives without the Court.</L>
<L>Tho' to our Scenes no Royal Robes belong,</L>
<L>And tho' our little Stage as yet be young <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Tragedy was first acted at the Little Theatre in the <HI>Hay-Market</HI>.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>Throw both your Scorn and Prejudice aside,</L>
<L>Let us with Favour, not Contempt be try'd;</L>
<L>Thro' the first Acts a kind Attention lend,</L>
<L>The growing Scene shall force you to attend;</L>
<L>Shall catch the Eyes of every tender Fair,</L>
<L>And make them charm their Lovers with a Tear.</L>
<L>The Lover too by Pity shall impart</L>
<L>His tender Passion to his fair One's Heart:</L>
<L>The Breast which others Anguish cannot move,</L>
<L>Was ne'er the Seat of Friendship, or of Love.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>O. Wilm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>It was a dreadful one.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Some found it so. A noble ship from <HI>India</HI></L>
<L>Ent'ring the harbour, run upon a rock,</L>
<L>And there was lost.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>O. Wilm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>What 'came of those on board her?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Some few are sav'd, but much the greater part,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. <HI>Wilm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>They are past the fear</L>
<L>Of future tempests, or a wrack on shore:</L>
<L>Those who escap'd, are still expos'd to both.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>But I've heard news much stranger than this ship-wrack</L>
<L>Here in <HI>Cornwall</HI>. The brave Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>,</L>
<L>Being arriv'd at <HI>Plymouth</HI> from <HI>Guiana</HI>,</L>
<L>A most unhappy voyage, has been betray'd</L>
<L>By base Sir <HI>Lewis Stukeley</HI>, his own kinsman,</L>
<L>And seiz'd on by an order from the court;</L>
<L>And 'tis reported, he must lose his head,</L>
<L>To satisfy the <HI>Spaniards</HI>.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. <HI>Wilm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Not unlikely:</L>
<L>His martial genius does not suit the times.</L>
<L>There's now no insolence that <HI>Spain</HI> can offer,</L>
<L>But to the shame of this pacific reign,</L>
<L>Poor <HI>England</HI> must submit to. Gallant man!</L>
<L>Posterity perhaps may do thee justice,</L>
<L>And praise thy courage, learning, and integrity,</L>
<L>When thou'rt past hearing. Thy successful ene∣mies</L>
<L>Much sooner paid, have their reward in hand,</L>
<L>And know for what they labour'd. Such events</L>
<L>Must, questionless, excite all thinking men,</L>
<L>To love and practise virtue!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>Nay, 'tis certain</L>
<L>That virtue ne'er appears so like itself,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>So truly bright and great, as when opprest.</L>

<L>I saw her pass the <HI>High-street</HI> t'wards the Minster.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>O. <HI>Wilm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<L>She's gone to visit <HI>Charlot</HI>. She doth well.</L>
<L>In the soft bosom of that gentle maid</L>
<L>There dwells more goodness, than the rigid race</L>
<L>Of moral pedants e'er believ'd, or taught.</L>
<L>With what amazing constancy and truth,</L>
<L>Doth she sustain the absence of our son,</L>
<L>Whom more than life she loves! How shun for him,</L>
<L>Whom we shall ne'er see more, the rich and great;</L>
<L>Who own her charms more than supply the want</L>
<L>Of shining heaps, and sigh to make her happy.</L>
<L>Since our misfortunes we have found no friend,</L>
<L>None who regarded our distress, but her;</L>
<L>And she, by what I have observed of late,</L>
<L>Is tired, or exhausted. Curst condition!—</L>
<L>To live a burden to one only friend,</L>
<L>And blast her youth with our contagious woe! —</L>
<L>Who that had reason, soul, or sense would bear it</L>
<L>A moment longer! Then this honest wretch!—</L>
<L>I must dismiss him—Why should I detain</L>
<L>A grateful, gen'rous youth to perish with me?</L>
<L>His service may procure him bread elsewhere,</L>

<L>No more of that: Thou'st served me longer since</L>

<L>Like pamper'd vermin from a falling house,</L>
<L>Retreated with the plunder they had gain'd,</L>

<L>For such ungrateful wretches, to be crush'd</L>
